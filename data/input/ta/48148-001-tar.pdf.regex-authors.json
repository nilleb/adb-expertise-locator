INTRODUCTION \n1.  Priority sectors identified in the Government of Solomon Islands\u2019 National Development \nStrategy, 2011\u20132020 include transport, power, and other infrastructure. The government has \nrequested support to address some deficiencies in its country safeguard system (CSS) that \nhinder  the  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects,  as  identified  through  prior  technical \nassistance (TA).1 The government, development partners, and stakeholders were consulted \nduring Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions in November 2013 and February 2014.2 The \ngovernment  agreed  on  the  proposed  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing, and terms of reference in July 2014. The design and monitoring \nframework is provided in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Solomon Islands is a fragile and conflict-affected state. The country suffers from weak \ngovernance  and  civil  service  management,  and  the  government  has  difficulty  providing \nadequate  infrastructure  and  services  across  the  country\u2019s  long  distances  and  sparsely \npopulated islands. The country has a high demand for new and improved infrastructure but \ntypically  experiences  delays  in  the  implementation  of  projects  because  of  blockages  from \nsafeguard issues. One major challenge is addressing project-related land and environmental \nissues. Predominantly through providing transport sector support since the early 2000s, ADB \nhas recognized that the government struggles with applying safeguards. Since 2012, ADB has \nbeen  providing  TA  to  the  government  to  strengthen  environmental  and  social  safeguards \n(footnote 1). \n3.  The  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  is  responsible  for  infrastructure \ndevelopment; the Ministry of Lands, Housing, and Survey (MLHS) oversees land management; \nand the Environment and Conservation Division (ECD) of the Ministry of Environment, Climate \nChange, Disaster Management, and Meteorology (MECDM) supervises environmental aspects. \nMID,  MLHS, and  MECDM have  weak legal and institutional capacity to apply safeguards, \nparticularly in the infrastructure sector where projects often require access to land. Overall, the \nCSS is poorly administered. Both MLHS and MECDM are understaffed, their human resource \nmanagement plans do not match corporate plans, and their staff job descriptions are outdated \nand do not align with core functions and services required to meet the legislation\u2019s prescribed \nmandates. Neither ministry has been able to build strong bids for recruitment, leaving key areas \nof the CSS without staff to implement them. \n4.  The Land and Titles Act 1969 (LTA) governs ownership and use of land and establishes \nthe system of land acquisition. The Environment Act 1998 requires a development consent \nprocess, including environmental assessment of development activities. These laws are the \nfoundation of the CSS framework. \n5.  Social safeguard aspects. MLHS lacks awareness of overall legal processes for land \nacquisition  and,  as  a  result,  functions  as  isolated  departments,  contributing  to  delays  in \nformalities and causing other agencies to create \u201cwork-arounds.\u201d For example, due to difficulties \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Solomon Islands for Strengthening Country Safeguard Systems in the \nTransport Sector. Manila (TA 8217-SOL, $600,000, approved on 16 November, financed by the Japan Fund for \nPoverty Reduction). \n2  The fact finding for the TA was undertaken in conjunction with review missions for the Technical Assistance to the \nSolomon Islands for Strengthening Country Safeguard Systems in the Transport Sector (see footnote 1). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 August 2014. \n ", "2  \nand delays in projects, MID takes a memorandum-of-understanding (MOU) approach rather \nthan a lease or acquisition approach.  \n6.  The MOU approach is an informal agreement for MID to use and access land in return \nfor provision of infrastructure (such as a road), whereas a lease or acquisition is a formal \nagreement and in the case of acquisition results in change of title to, and ownership of, land. A \nseries of MOUs were obtained under a recently completed project.4 However, communities are \nalready asking when the land will be acquired. This shows communities are no longer content \nwith this approach, and supports the need for MID to prepare a formal land acquisition policy. \n7.  Both the LTA itself and land acquisition process as administered by MLHS have flaws. \nThe  LTA  is  inconsistent  with  the  Constitution  and  does  not  address  aspects  considered \nessential in the safeguard policies of development partners, i.e., social assessment, livelihood \nrestoration, compensation to non-titleholders, access to information and information disclosure, \nand grievance redress mechanisms. Flaws related to the land acquisition process include (i) no \nin-house MLHS land acquisition officers (LAOs), required subcontracted LAO services that are \nvulnerable to abuse, (ii) weak capacity in the Valuation Department and Genealogy Section, (iii) \nnonstandard  and  poorly  resourced  processes  for  verifying  land  owners,  leading  to \nmisidentification and disputes, and (iv) the low-functioning Custom Land Recording Unit, located \nin the Prime Minister\u2019s Office instead of MLHS.5   \n8.  Environmental safeguard aspects. ECD\u2019s implementation of the Environment Act is ad \nhoc. There are no clear guidelines for decision making at important project cycle stages, such \nas screening or determining the appropriate level of environmental assessment. There are also \nno checklists or guides to assist staff achieve consistency when reviewing development consent \napplications, environmental assessment reports, public consultation records, mitigation plans, \nand  consent  conditions.  Unsystematic  and  irregular  record  keeping  makes  following  the \ndevelopment consent process, and locating environmental assessment documents, difficult. \nConsultation  lacks  consistency,  which  can  result  in  inadequate  public  consultation  on \nenvironmental  assessments  or  insufficient  public  feedback  in  the  review  process.  In  other \ncases, conflicts of interest have occurred, with ECD preparing environmental assessments for \ndevelopments proposed by other line ministries and then reviewing them. These factors lead to \ninconsistency in applying the Environment Act, resulting in the omission or diminishment of \ntransparency and good governance.  \n9.  Flaws  and  inconsistencies  in  the  CSS\u2019s  legal framework  and  implementation mean \nsafeguards cannot be effectively administered. This results in approval delays for infrastructure \nprojects and other issues during their implementation. Supporting good governance through \nstrengthened safeguard procedures in MLHS and MECDM, along with improving capacity in the \napplication of safeguards, will help the government to implement infrastructure projects more \nsmoothly and with fewer delays.  \n10.  As a number of major transport projects are planned, it is increasingly important that the \ngovernment\u2019s development partners support MLHS and MECDM to embed new and improved \nprocedures for land acquisition and development consent.6  \n \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2009. Grant Assistance to Solomon Islands for the Second Road Improvement (Sector) Project. Manila \n5  Approximately half of land cases end up in the courts contesting ownership.   \n6  Under the Technical Assistance to the Solomon Islands for Strengthening Country Safeguard Systems in the \nTransport Sector, the key recommendations from the legal review and institutional capacity assessment were \ndrawn together in an action plan. The priority actions\u2014identified by MLHS, MECDM, and MID through consultative \nworkshops held in November 2013\u2014form the basis of this new TA.   \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be smoother and timelier implementation of infrastructure \nprojects. By 2018, compared with a 2014 baseline, a third fewer projects will be experiencing \nsafeguard-related delays. \n12.  The TA outcome will be increased government capacity to apply strengthened land \nacquisition and development consent procedures in the transport sector. This will be measured \nby (i) institutionalized procedures for land acquisition and development consent established and \nimplemented in MLHS and MECDM by 2016, and (ii) improved levels, compared with 2014 \nbaseline levels, of service of MLHS and MECDM for land acquisition and development consent \nprocedures by 2016. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will comprise the following outputs and key activities to achieve the outcome. \n14.  Output 1: Strengthened systems and a fully constitutional safeguards framework. \nThis first output will include  (i) drafting background papers (for the Cabinet) and proposed \nlegislative  reforms  to  the  LTA  and  Environment  Act,  (ii)  drafting  enabling  regulations  and \nguidelines  for  (a)  the  Customary  Land  Records  Act,  (b)  the  customary  land  trust  board \n(including clear definitions of roles, responsibilities, and functions of trustees), (c) the land \nacquisition review panel, and (d) land acquisition and/or resettlement, and (iii) supporting MID to \nprepare its land acquisition policy. \n15.  Output  2:  Established  institutional  arrangements  for  land  acquisition  and  the \ndevelopment consent process. This second output will include (i) preparing guidelines and \ndeveloping an operations manual to assist ECD staff make decisions under the Environment Act \n\u2014project description, screening, clear triggers to determine the appropriate level of assessment \n(i.e., public environmental report or environmental impact statement), stakeholder consultations, \nprocedures  for  the  environmental  impact  statement  (including  development  of  terms  of \nreference, public disclosure and comment, and review), and establishment of a review panel; (ii) \npreparing guidelines for MLHS staff and LAOs on accreditation and registration of LAOs, duties \nof  land  acquisition  review  panel  members,  stakeholder  consultations,  and  mechanism  for \nresolving land ownership disputes including appeal procedures; (iii) providing capacity building \nand training to MID, MLHS, and MECDM;7 (iv) providing capacity building to ECD and MID staff, \npiloting the modified development consent process, preparing the environmental assessment, \nand providing capacity building to MID and MLHS staff and piloting the modified land acquisition \nprocess, including land and asset prices negotiated, agreed upon, and documented in a land \nacquisition report.8 MID will use the land acquisition report to include the compensation amount \nin its 2016 budget.  \n16.  Assumptions. Improvements made in land acquisition and environmental assessment \nprocesses for the transport sector will also benefit other sectors (e.g., energy, water, health, and \n                                                \n7  Training  will  include  on-the-job  training,  capacity  building,  and  mentoring  on  applying  proposed  modified \nprocedures, and workshop and seminar sessions delivered at key points. \n8  In February 2014, MID identified two potential projects for piloting the procedures, i.e., 10 kilometers of Mberande\u2013\nAola Road (east Guadalcanal) and Tamboko Bridge realignment area (west Guadalcanal). The projects will be \nagreed upon with MID and MLHS at the start of the TA. \n ", "4  \neducation). The strengthened systems and institutions will benefit government projects and \nprojects supported by its development partners.  \n17.  Risks. Potential risks identified include the following: (i) the proposed amendments to \nexisting laws may not be adopted; (ii) stakeholders may continue to use separate procedures \nand systems; and, (iii) government departments may not be adequately staffed and resourced.  \n18.  Mitigation. The purpose of the TA is to help embed strengthened procedures, not \nnecessarily to conclude the land acquisition process. Per required TA outputs, the TA will \ncontinue supporting the government to strengthen its CSS by drafting amending legislation and \nenabling regulations under the LTA, rather than ensuring their passage or eventual adoption.  \n19.   The first  risk will be mitigated by continuing the participation of the Working Group and \nstakeholder  consultations  started  under  Technical  Assistance  for  Strengthening  Country \nSafeguard Systems in Transport Sector (footnote 1) and the high-level and sector level buy-in of \nparticipating agencies.    \n20.  The second  risk will be reduced through gradual improvements in the government\u2019s \nperformance  in  applying  safeguards  and  a  decreasing  number  of  projects  experiencing \nsafeguards-related delays, which will lessen the need to rely on parallel systems. The third  risk \ncan be mitigated through several ongoing and proposed activities, including carefully realigning \nthe mandate, functions, and services proposed as part of the revision of corporate plans, and \nassisting MECDM and MLHS9 to strengthen their recruitment to increase staffing to requisite \nlevels and skills.10 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $337,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).  \n22.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation,  office  supplies,  office-hours  telecommunications  and  internet  access,  and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan is provided in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The  MID  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  manage  the  TA  with  support  from  the \nTransport, Energy and Natural Resources Division of ADB\u2019s Pacific Department, the Pacific \nLiaison and Coordination Office in Sydney, and the Development Coordination Office and ADB \nInfrastructure Advisor in Solomon Islands.   \n24.  MLHS and MECDM will be the implementing agencies.  \n25.  Coordination will be supported through the working group that was established\u2014and \nworked effectively\u2014for Technical Assistance for Strengthening Country Safeguard Systems in \nthe Transport Sector in Solomon Islands (refer to footnote 1). \n                                                \n9  This process is already being undertaken for MID through the Technical Assistance for Supporting the Transport \nSector Development Project (2010) in parallel to the ADB Transport Sector Development Project (2010. Manila). \n10  The United Nations Development Programme is implementing an institutional strengthening and reform project \nwhich is focusing on broad human resources management aspects. The TA will include only those aspects that are \naligned with other elements of TA activities, such as matching corporate plans and servicing needs (core functions) \nto proposed revisions to legal framework and modified processes and procedures. The UNDP project will be \nundertaking the assessment of existing organizational structure and resourcing and making recommendations as \nto optimum institutional framework, including any restructuring. \n ", "  5\n26.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  5  January\u201331  December  2015.  A  team  of  individual \ninternational (three) and national (two) consultants will be recruited for a total of 21 person-\nmonths in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Disbursements will conform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of equipment, if any, will follow \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The consultants will \ntransfer any equipment purchased under the TA to participating government agencies upon \ncompletion. \n27.  The recruited international environmental specialist will act as team leader to coordinate \nthe tasks and activities of each specialist. The national specialists will assist in the pilot and \nimplementation of capacity-building initiatives, and will serve as secretary to the working group \nwhen the team leader is not in country. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n28.  The TA activities will be closely monitored, and feedback from the government and \nstakeholders will be sought on TA performance. The draft TA outputs will be discussed or \nshared with government agencies, development partners, and other relevant stakeholders.  \n29.  The  ADB  and  government  will  widely  disseminate  the  TA  information  for  public \nawareness and consultation at various stages through, among others, workshops, seminars, \nand meetings. A completion report will be prepared at the end of the TA. The outputs will be \npublished  on  ADB\u2019s  website  and  provided  to  relevant  government  agencies  and  other \nstakeholders for public dissemination per ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2011).  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n30.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Solomon Islands for Supporting Good Governance through Safeguards, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Targets     \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact  By 2018, compared with  Assumption \nMID annual plans and work \nSmoother and timelier  2014 baseline (as  Improvements made in land \nprograms \nimplementation of  documented in case  acquisition and environmental \ninfrastructure  studies of six government-  Corporate plans  assessment processes for the \nprojects.  and development partner-  Annual reports  transport sector are beneficial \nfinanced projects), a third  to other sectors (e.g., energy, \nImplementation guidelines \nfewer projects will  water, health, and education). \nexperience delays  Registry   \nassociated with  Risk \nKIIs with clients and staff \nsafeguards.

Introduction \n1.  A team of individual international (three) and national (two) consultants will be recruited \nfor a total of 21 person-months (over 12 months) by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). The purpose of the technical assistance (TA) is to support the Ministry of Lands, Housing, \nand Survey (MLHS), the Environment and Conservation Division (ECD) within the Ministry of \nEnvironment, Climate Change, Disaster Management, and Meteorology (MECDM), and the \nMinistry  of  Infrastructure  Development  (MID)  to  embed  and  apply  improved  safeguards \npractices that are standard rather than project-specific. \n2.  The expected benefits from the TA are (i) smoother and timelier implementation of \ninfrastructure projects, and (ii) increased government capacity for applying strengthened land \nacquisition  and  development  consent  procedures  in  the  transport  sector.  This  will  lead  to \neffective management of social and environmental issues in infrastructure projects, particularly \nin the transport sector, by the government and its development partners.
