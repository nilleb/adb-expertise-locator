THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of Uzbekistan for the Western Uzbekistan Water Supply System Development \nProject. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Uzbekistan in improving water supply services \nin the Republic of Karakalpakstan (RK), an autonomous republic in Uzbekistan. It will upgrade \nand expand water supply networks, improve climate change awareness and resilience, build \ninstitutional capacity, and strengthen the sustainability of the RK\u2019s water supply and sanitation \n(WSS) utility.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Spanning more than 165,000 square kilometers, the RK covers the entire northwestern \nextremity of Uzbekistan.2 It has a dispersed population of about 1.8 million, and its primary \neconomic drivers are agriculture, natural gas, and minerals. The RK\u2019s natural environment is \nprimarily arid desert comprising sparse, barren lands that are subject to severe drought. As such, \nthe RK suffers from acute surface water shortage. Although aquifers exist, the groundwater is \nmostly saline and of limited value, as it is prohibitively expensive to treat for human consumption. \nWater supply conditions are therefore critical. \n \n4.  Municipal water supply services in the RK are provided by a regional WSS utility, the State \nUnitary Enterprise Department for Operation of Interregional Water Supply Tuyamuyun-Nukus \n(TN).3  Although  operational,  TN  faces  considerable  challenges  as  most  of  its  Soviet-era \ninfrastructure has depreciated to the point of dilapidation. Its services are unreliable, leakage \nlosses are high, and water quality is a growing concern. These deficiencies prevent TN from \ndelivering  services  that  meet  regulator  and  public  expectations,  which  in  turn  undermines \nconsumer confidence and willingness to pay, increases regulator reluctance to raise tariffs, and \nreduces financial and institutional performance. As with similar utilities in Uzbekistan, the TN has \nbecome locked in a vicious cycle that requires external intervention to modernize and expand its \nasset base while overhauling its institutional capacity. \n \n5.  TN\u2019s service deficiencies relate directly to poor WSS sector performance. In the RK, only \n37% of the population in the project area\u201413% in rural areas\u2014is connected to the centralized \nwater supply system. Recent surveys indicate that 40% of connected households receive water \nfor less than 6 hours per week and that water pressures are often low. About 75% of connected \nhouseholds reportedly experience excessive water salinity and hardness issues. 4 Correlations \nare also frequently drawn between poor water quality and waterborne disease incidence.5 The \nsubstantial consumer base that is yet to be connected to a centralized water supply is forced to \npurchase water from trucked supplies at exorbitant prices or consume water that is increasingly \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Western Uzbekistan \nWater Supply System Development Project. \n2  Established through the 1992 Constitution of Uzbekistan, the RK is an integral region of Uzbekistan that has \nprotected sovereignty, an autonomous status, and its own constitution. \n3  The TN has about 1,650 employees. Its centralized system services 41,979 domestic and 770 institutional and \ncommercial consumers. It also provides trucked water to 6,282 consumers in remote areas. \n4  ADB. 2017. Poverty and Social Analysis Report for the Western Uzbekistan Water Supply Development Project. \nConsultant\u2019s report. Manila. (TA 9286-UZB). \n5  Muynak in northern Karakalpakstan had a significantly high incidence of hepatitis A in 2014 and 2015. \n \n ", "2 \npolluted.6 \n \n6.  The government fully recognized the sector constraints and, with support from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and other development partners, has responded by implementing a \nphased, nationwide institutional consolidation and sector-wide management, financial, and cost \nrecovery reform program. The initial phase, driven largely by the Decree of the Cabinet of \nMinisters No. 306, has led to the consolidation of Karakalpakstan\u2019s WSS services into TN and the \nimplementation of more than 40 time-bound corporate governance improvements to strengthen \nutility capacity.7 The second phase is overhauling the wider institutional framework by creating \nthe Ministry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS).8 The Agency Kommunhizmat (CSA), \nreporting to the MHCS, is responsible for implementing externally funded projects including those \nfunded by ADB.9 \n \n7.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Operational Plan, 2011\u2013202010 and Country \nOperations Business Plan, 2018\u20132020 for Uzbekistan.11 It will support the government\u2019s WSS \nreform program by helping improve TN\u2019s institutional capacity, while revitalizing its regional water \nsupply system in six of the 14 districts of the RK.12 Benefitting 388,000 inhabitants, the project will \nprovide reliable and safe water supply through metered household connections.13 \n \n8.  Lessons to be incorporated in the project design from previous ADB sector experience \ninclude (i) securing timely counterpart support by engaging government agencies at the early \nstage of project preparation, (ii) improving project quality and efficiency by adopting least-cost \nsolutions in project design, (iii) providing training and capacity building of project implementation \npersonnel to reduce procurement and construction delay, and (iv) accelerating domestic approval \nprocedures by engaging design institutes during project preparation. \n \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project enables the government to implement the \nmost  efficient  solution  in  meeting  water  supply  demands  in  the  RK.  It  will  also  introduce \ninternational best practices and support WSS reforms, including tariff reforms and the phase out \nof flat tariffs. The government would not be able to incorporate these interventions without ADB \nsupport. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: climate resilience, health and living \n                                                \n6  Survey results show that household consumers purchase trucked water from TN at a cost of SUM5,000 per cubic \nmeter (m3) versus a piped water tariff of SUM675/m3. \n7  Government  of  Uzbekistan.  2015.

Tashkent.  The  decree  led  to  the  amalgamation  of  the  rural  WSS  entity \nKarakalpakselkhozvodoprovod with TN. \n8  The MHCS manages government policy and interdepartmental coordination for housing and other communal service \nsectors, including WSS.  The project supports this second phase, by providing institutional capacity strengthening of \nthe MHCS and the CSA. \n9  The CSA is the authorized government entity responsible for developing investment projects in WSS and other \ncommunal service sectors, including projects funded by international finance institutions. \n10 ADB. 2011.

The project will have the following outcome: access to climate-\nresilient, reliable, sustainable, and affordable water supply services improved and expanded in \nthe six selected project districts of the RK.14 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Water supply infrastructure rehabilitated, expanded, and upgraded. This \noutput comprises the (i) construction, rehabilitation, and expansion of three water treatment plants \n(WTPs);  (ii)  construction  and  rehabilitation  of  about  300  kilometers  of  water  mains; \n(iii) construction of 4 water distribution centers and rehabilitation of 24 water distribution centers; \n(iv) construction and rehabilitation of about 900 kilometers in the water distribution network; and \n(v) provision of consumer meters. \n \n12.  Output 2: Institutional capacity strengthened. This output includes (i) formulating \nperformance indicator-based reporting; (ii) establishing a training center; (iii) operationalizing a \nnonrevenue water control system, a geographic information system, and hydraulic modeling; \n(iv) introducing  web-based  management  and  reporting  systems;  and  (v)  commissioning  a \ngrievance redress mechanism. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n13.  The project is estimated to cost $172 million (Table 1).

The government has requested a concessional loan of $145 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The government \nwill relend the entire loan proceeds to the TN pursuant to a subsidiary loan agreement under \nsimilar terms. \n \n15.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  CSA is the executing agency for the project. It will be responsible for, among others, \nprocurement, contract management support, financial management, project administration, and \nsafeguards compliance and reporting. The TN will be the implementing agency for the project, \nwith its Investment Department as the implementation unit. It will be (i) the employer in all \ncontracts under the project, (ii) the owner of all constructed and rehabilitated facilities, (iii) the \nholder of the advance account, and (iv) the agency responsible for preparing project financial \nstatements and entity financial statements. The Interdepartmental Council is an oversight body \nthat provides strategic guidance and makes policy level decisions during project implementation. \n \n18.

CSA  has  requested  advance  contracting  for  the  early  recruitment  of  the  project \nmanagement consultants (PMCs) and detailed design consultants.17 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n20.  The selection of project districts follows ADB and government priorities. In addition to \noverall technical viability, system continuity, raw water quality for treatment, and constructability, \nthe selection of the districts was based on weighted criteria relating to population, public health \nand safety, climate change vulnerability, and economic development potential. \n \n21.  Due to the unique water resource situation in the RK, in that surface water from the Amu \nDarya River constitutes the primary and reliable water source, technically and financially viable \noptions are limited to (i) centralized treatment and long-haul transmissions to distribution centers; \n(ii) localized treatment using groundwater; and (iii) centralized treatment at three optimal locations \nand with supplemental local groundwater treatment where feasible. Option (iii) was recommended \ndue to its least cost and maximum beneficial impacts. The water supply infrastructure developed \nunder Option (iii) will also serve as the main grid of the RK water supply system for future water \nsupply service development in the eight remaining districts of the territory. The proposed design \nand technology are compatible with local conditions and the capacity of the TN. Technical features \nand the selection of materials incorporate measures for climate change resilience and adaptation. \nOpen-cut and trenchless methods using high-density polyethylene pipe will be adopted. \n                                                \n17 Advertisement expected in the third quarter of 2018. \n ", "6 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.   In September 2017, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan devalued the local \ncurrency by 92.38% to $1 = SUM8,100. However, recent procurement for WSS projects funded \nby international financial institutions showed that the estimated contract costs in United States \ndollars have remained unchanged. The uncertainty brought by the sum\u2019s devaluation will be \ncarefully monitored during project implementation. \n \n23.  Economic analysis. An economic analysis was conducted following ADB guidelines and \nderived benefits from (i) incremental water consumption calculated using willingness to pay and \nwater demand projections as proxies; and (ii) resource cost savings from non-incremental water \nsales when households switch from alternative water sources to piped water. It also estimated \nthe health benefits from the improved reliability and quality of non-incremental water consumption \nleading to potentially lowered incidence of waterborne diseases in the project areas. The resulting \nbase-case economic internal rate of return is 11.47%, exceeding ADB\u2019s prescribed minimum \ndiscount rate of 9.00% and confirming the project\u2019s economic viability. A sensitivity analysis \nundertaken to test economic viability determined that the project will remain economically robust \nunder the following scenarios: (i) a 10% increase in investment cost, (ii) a 10% increase in \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs, (iii) a 10% decline in benefits, (iv) a combination of the \nfirst three scenarios, and (v) a 1-year delay in subproject benefits. The sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the economic internal rate of return is most sensitive to a combination of an increase in capital \ncost with a decrease in benefits, and least sensitive to an increase in O&M costs. \n \n24.   Financial analysis. A financial cost\u2013benefit analysis was conducted and the results \nconfirmed the financial viability of the project. The calculated financial internal rate of return was \n1.42%, exceeding the weighted average cost of capital of 0.45%. The sensitivity analysis showed \nthat financial viability will be at risk if increased investments and O&M costs are combined \nsimultaneously with a decline in tariff revenues. To yield a positive financial internal rate of return, \nThe analysis assumed under a worst-case scenario that tariffs would need to be increased by \nabout 180% in real terms by 2023. Nominally, this entails increasing the tariff for residential users \nfrom the current rate of SUM675/cubic meter (m3) to SUM2,786/m3 by 2024. The assumed \nincrease in tariffs requires an annual real rate of increase of 14.5%, which is higher than the \n12.3% historical average of the real rate of tariff increases in the RK since 2012.18 ADB has \ndiscussed the proposed rate of increase with the Ministry of Finance and TN, and both have \nagreed that the rate is reasonable given the exceptionally high demand for clean, safe, and \nreliable water supply in the project districts and the lower tariff increases from 2012 to 2017. The \ntariff would also be affordable to targeted household beneficiaries that have expressed their \nwillingness to pay more for cleaner, safer, and more reliable water systems. At present, most of \nthem access clean water through trucks or vendors at a higher cost of SUM5,000/m3. \n \n25.  To ensure financial sustainability, the government remains committed to support TN\u2019s debt \nservicing19 and Uzbekistan\u2019s water tariff reforms.20 The analysis indicates that TN\u2019s operating ratio \nwill exceed one, which is required to maintain the company\u2019s financial sustainability. \n \n                                                \n18 Ministry of Finance revised water tariffs annually until 2009, and twice a year thereafter (in April and October). \n19 Government of Uzbekistan. 2012. Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan \u201cAbout \nAdditional Measures for Ensuring Timely Servicing of the Foreign Credit and Borrowed Funds Raised for Project \nImplementation on Improvement of Water Supply in the Republic of Karakalpakstan and the Khorezm Region.\u201d \nNo. 66. Tashkent (7 March). Resolution No. 66 stipulates that the government will subsidize an average of 93% of \nTN\u2019s debt servicing requirements until 2043. \n20 ADB approved a technical assistance on water and sanitation strategy development and capacity building in \nUzbekistan to assist the government in improving its water tariff regulatory framework. \n ", "7 \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  Originally established as an interregional bulk producer and supplier of water from the \nTuyamuyun system to water distribution agencies, the TN was reorganized in 2016 to become a \nstate-owned enterprise solely responsible for providing WSS in the RK. In general, officers and \nstaff possess moderate knowledge and skills in financial management, which are expected to be \nstrengthened  by  the  government\u2019s  strong  commitment  to  sector  reforms  and  improved \ngovernance. These initiatives encompass major legislative and regulatory reforms; institutional \nrationalization; and a renewed focus on efficiency, accountability, and sustainability through \nimproved cost recovery. \n \n27.  The overall financial management risk rating of the TN is moderate for the following \nreasons: (i) it has limited experience in managing advance accounts;21 (ii) adjustments are \nnecessary to its accounting, budgeting, auditing, and reporting systems for the project\u2019s financial \nmanagement; and (iii) its staff lack sufficient understanding of ADB\u2019s loan disbursement policies \nand procedures. CSA has experience in implementing WSS projects funded by ADB, the World \nBank, and other international financial institutions; and it will supervise and guide TN to mitigate \nthe financial management risk. Under CSA\u2019s overall supervision, TN will have access to financial \nmanagement consultants and training. \n \n28.  Procurement risk assessment confirmed that the overall risk is high mainly because of \nprolonged government oversight procedures and implementation delays experienced by CSA in \nits past procurement transactions. With the project risk mitigation measures and other support \nactivities implemented, however, CSA generally satisfies ADB requirements for an executing \nagency and its system is adequate to (i) prepare qualified bidding documents; and (ii) conduct the \nprocurement of works, goods, equipment, and consulting services. Engaging international PMCs \nwill strengthen CSA further and will ensure that all procurement procedures are conducted with \ndue consideration for economy, efficiency, and transparency. ADB will coordinate closely with \ngovernment agencies to minimize delays. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government,  CSA,  and  TN.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 16). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The project supports poverty reduction indirectly through improved access to safe and \nreliable drinking water. More than half of the 388,000 inhabitants in the project area are poor.22 \nOnly 37% of project households have access to piped water while the rest use hand-pumped \nwater or other sources for their living needs. Some 15% of households purchase drinking water \nand 9% use potentially unsafe water from open sources (canals and rivers) for drinking and \ncooking because of unstable water supply. Only 21% of households in the project area have \nbathrooms with piped water supply and only 2% have flushing toilets. Just 34% of households are \nsatisfied with the quality of piped water. Kindergartens, schools, colleges, medical institutions, \nand hospitals (about 450 social establishments) lack adequate water supply and improved \nsanitation facilities. Better access to safe and reliable potable water will improve hygiene and \nsanitation practices, improve public health, and reduce household costs for medical care. The \n                                                \n21 Following previous government practice in the Uzbekistan WSS sector, implementing agencies did not manage \nadvance accounts. \n22 Using the 1.5 times the minimum monthly wage as a poverty threshold, the poverty and social assessment \nconsidered more than half of the project area\u2019s households as poor. \n \n ", "8 \nproject will improve the health, living conditions, and productivity of residents while contributing to \npoverty reduction in the target areas.23 \n \n31.  WSS constraints negatively affect the quality of life of all family members, especially of \nwomen, who are primarily responsible for delivering water, cooking, cleaning, and caring for \nchildren and sick and disabled family members. The project will directly reduce the workload of \nwomen and girls, freeing up their time and providing them with greater opportunities for economic \nand educational activities. \n \n32.  The project\u2019s primary beneficiaries will be about 388,000 inhabitants, about 50% of whom \nare women and girls. Project implementation will reduce unproductive labor costs, sparing about \nthree working days for women every month, and develop improved sanitation practices and \npositive hygiene behavior among women and schoolchildren to ensure maximum health benefits. \nAt least 178,000 women and girls will have access to continuous potable centralized water \nsupplies. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. Gender-specific actions are \nset out in the gender action plan with the following key features: recruitment of a PCU social \ndevelopment and gender specialist, facilitation of women\u2019s participation in project-associated \nactivities, and provision of employment opportunities for women in laboratory and customer care \nunits and during the construction period.24 The project\u2019s gender action plan envisages the \ncollection of sex-disaggregated data on most of the planned activities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.25 \n \n34.  Environment (category B). Project impacts are expected to be limited in magnitude and \nshort-term in nature, and to mostly relate to the construction and rehabilitation of the distribution \ncenters, transmission mains, and distribution networks. These include dust, noise, vibration, \nhazardous  solid  waste  (asbestos-containing  materials,  scrap  metals,  and  oils  from  old \nequipment), labor and public safety, temporary blockage of household access, traffic disturbance, \nand the production and transportation of construction materials. CSA has included mitigation \nmeasures to address construction and operational impacts in the environmental management \nplan (EMP), which it prepared as part of the initial environmental examination. \n \n35.  Environmental impacts during the operation phase include increased water use from water \nsources, the disposal of sludge from the WTPs and borehole sites, accidental leakage from \nchlorination, noise from WTPs and pumping stations, and higher sewage production relative to \nthe capability of community facilities. The implementation of a planned regional sewerage system \nwill mitigate impacts from increased sewage production.26 In addition, the project incorporates a \nsanitation and hygiene improvement program that pilots wastewater improvements for poor, rural \nhouseholds.27 The initial environmental examination was disclosed on the ADB website on \n6 September 2017. CSA conducted public consultations in all project districts. \n \n                                                \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB.

The government will conduct an awareness program before the sewerage system is \noperationalized. \n27 Rural Sanitation and Hygiene Improvement Program, anticipated to pilot the installation of septic tanks. \n ", "9 \n36.  The PCU in CSA will be responsible for EMP implementation and for compliance with \nADB\u2019s  safeguard requirements  and  national  environmental regulations.  The  PCU\u2019s  existing \nsafeguard staff will be assisted by the PMC\u2019s environmental specialists, who will oversee EMP \nimplementation.  A full-time safeguard staff member will be provided to the implementing agency. \nThe project will finance EMP implementation costs, while mitigation measures and environmental \nmonitoring costs will be included in the construction contracts and environmental supervision \ncosts will be included in the PMC consulting services. A grievance redress mechanism to handle \nboth environmental and social safeguard issues will be established after project effectiveness. \nThe  PCU  will  submit  semiannual  environmental  monitoring  reports  to  ADB  and  relevant \ngovernment authorities, and these reports will be disclosed to the public on the websites of CSA \n(in Uzbek or Russian) and ADB (in English). \n \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The resettlement due diligence conducted for \nthe project, based on the preliminary design and walkover surveys, suggests that no land \nacquisition and resettlement impacts will occur, as construction works will be within the existing \nfacilities owned by the TN, on municipal land, on state land reserve, and within the rights-of-way \nassigned to municipal roads and municipal infrastructure. Certification of land ownership was \nprovided  by  the  TN.  In  compliance  with  ADB  requirements,  CSA  prepared  a  resettlement \nframework to ensure that unanticipated impacts are considered during detailed design. If land \nacquisition and involuntary resettlement impacts or related unanticipated impacts are identified \nduring implementation, CSA will prepare a resettlement plan following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement, which it will submit to ADB for review before awarding any contracts and implement \nbefore starting civil works. \n \n38.  As part of the resettlement due diligence, CSA conducted 71 in-depth interviews and nine \npublic consultations in the six project districts. Communities expressed an immense need for \nclean and reliable drinking water supply in the project influence area, which could be achieved \nthrough the project. CSA, through the PCU, will carry out meaningful consultations throughout the \nproject cycle. The executing and/or implementing agency will establish an effective gender-\ninclusive  grievance  redress  mechanism  to  receive,  record,  and  facilitate  the  resolution  of \ncommunities\u2019 concerns related to any project impacts, with attention to vulnerable people. \n \n39.  The PCU has a dedicated safeguard specialist who will ensure that all activities related to \ninvoluntary land acquisition follow Uzbek legislation and policies and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement requirements. The PCU will ensure that the resettlement framework is updated after \ndetailed design is completed, and a resettlement plan will be prepared and implemented before \nstarting civil works if any land acquisition and resettlement impact is identified. The PMC will \nsupport the PCU. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project areas have an ethnic composition of 55% \nUzbeks, 26% Karakalpaks, and 16% Kazakhs. Piped water supply will benefit all communities. \nThe country, particularly the project area, does not have indigenous peoples\u2019 communities as \ndefined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. No further action will be required. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n41.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \n \n                                                \n28 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigation Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nConsumer tariff revenues do  Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 239 mandates tariffs to be \nnot meet expectations.  regulated by the Ministry of Finance.a Tariffs have increased twice per year \nin Karakalpakstan at an average of 14.5% annual real rate of increase.
