INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) puts a premium on results and helps its developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to manage for that. One course of action is evaluation capacity \ndevelopment (ECD), which entails reinforcing or establishing monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nsystems.1 Strong national and sector M&E systems are necessary to assess efforts to reduce \npoverty, and to demonstrate results. Such systems are one avenue for improving performance \nin terms of the quality, quantity, and targeting of goods and services. They also enrich the \nquality of ADB's own M&E, conducted through self-evaluation by operational departments as \nwell as independent evaluation by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED). OED has \nworked to mainstream ECD, but there is a long way to go\u2014building M&E systems is a serious \nundertaking  that  will  not  happen  overnight.  The  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost,  financing, \nimplementation, and terms of reference of the technical assistance (TA) were discussed at ADB \nwith the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in January 2007, and with \nthe  national  coordinators  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Economic  Cooperation \nprogram in August 2007. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  OED  has  backed  ECD  since  1990  to  raise  awareness  of  its  role  in  promoting \ntransparency, accountability, results orientation, and effectiveness of management systems.3 \nOED's interventions have (i) stimulated thinking on the function of M&E in good governance and \npublic  sector  reform;  (ii)  explored  the  complementarities  between  M&E,  results-based \nmanagement, and internal auditing; (iii) identified strategies and resources for building the \ndemand for and supply of M&E; and (iv) encouraged and supported the creation of country and \nregional  networks  to  facilitate follow-up  actions.4  Three  phases  have  characterized  OED's \napproach  to  ECD,  reflecting  corporate  shifts  from  benefit  M&E  and  postevaluation  to  a \nframework embracing the project cycle. In the first phase (1990\u20131994), seven small-scale TAs \nbuilt postevaluation capability in Bangladesh, PRC, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri \nLanka,  and  Thailand.  In  the  second  phase  (1995\u20131997),  five  TAs  established  project \nperformance management systems in PRC, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. In the \nthird phase (1999\u2013), two TAs built M&E systems in the PRC and Philippines. The chief lessons \nlearned from the evaluation of OED's interventions follow. \n(i)  The preconditions to ECD success include (a) substantive government demand, \n(b) existence of a mandate by decree for evaluation, and (c) stability in staffing \nsuch that a very high proportion of trained personnel remain in tasks for which \nthey were trained. \n(ii)  ECD  requires  a  vantage  point  encompassing  data  collection  in  the  field  to \naggregation and analysis by end users via reliable data systems. \n                                                 \n1  Capacity is the ability of individuals, groups, and organizations to manage affairs successfully. It is a key to overall \ndevelopment performance. ECD boosts national and sectoral capacities with institutional support, training, and \nnetworks so that M&E of operations is regularly conducted and utilized by governments and civil society. It \nfacilitates lesson learning and permits adjustment in such a manner that ongoing development operations achieve \ntheir planned objectives and the quality of the design of future operations improves. Monitoring is the regular \ntracking of inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts of operations. Evaluation is the systematic and \nobjective assessment of their relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, sustainability, and institutional impacts. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 April 2007. \n3  As of May 2007, OED had formulated 15 TAs for monitoring and evaluation, worth $4.35 million, in Bangladesh, \nPRC, Nepal, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. \n4  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n ", "2   \n(iii)  ECD that concentrates on the oversight agency carries the risk that other entities \nmay lack incentives to provide data and information. \n(iv)  Locating responsibility for M&E near the capable head of an organization can \nsecure the required status, budget, and staff support, and the ability to operate \nacross organizational boundaries. \n(v)  To develop staff competency and the confidence to carry out M&E\u2014as opposed \nto merely creating awareness of its importance and basic knowledge of tools, \nmethods, and approaches\u2014case studies are desirable. \n(vi)  ECD must take care that M&E systems do not become supply-driven, or too \ncomplex or resource-intensive to sustain. \n(vii)  Establishing M&E systems is a means to an end\u2014benefits are obtained when \nresults are used in decision making on strategy, policy, operations, budget, and \ninvestment. The design of ECD should include features that encourage, facilitate, \nand formalize incorporation of results in decision making. \n \n3.  The changing development context of the Asia and Pacific region and the advent of \nlearning organizations and knowledge-based economies have fed stocktaking exercises5 in \nOED that warrant placing a stronger accent on ECD. This would be congruent with items on the \ninternational development agenda, e.g., the Millennium Development Goals and the 2005 Paris \nDeclaration of Aid Effectiveness, and ADB's support for these. For instance, ECD can serve \nADB's Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy, which calls for increased attention to results and \nM&E and more emphasis on capacity development.6 It can sharpen ADB's results orientation at \nthe institutional level in ADB, at the level of DMCs, and through global partnerships.7 And it can \npresent opportunities to advance regional cooperation and integration.8 ADB's annual lending is \ntypically about $6 billion, with TA ranging from $200 million to $250 million per annum. For that \nreason alone, the return on ECD should be high and maximizing it is a legitimate concern. But \nADB must also plan better related outputs and outcomes and improve its ability to meet delivery \nchallenges. This is necessary because ECD suffers from lack of standardized approaches, \ndifficulties of attribution, the upstream nature of interventions, and the small scale of some of the \nwork. \n \n4.  The  Third  International  Roundtable  on  Managing  for  Development  Results  held  in \nFebruary 2007 in Hanoi, Viet Nam, was a critical milestone for aid effectiveness. It focused on \nbuilding the capacity of countries to manage for results and develop country-level and regional \naction plans. The priority on ECD is also reflected in a stronger demand for related knowledge \nproducts and services such as those offered by the International Program for Development \nEvaluation Training (IPDET)9 and the growth of evaluation associations.10 From experience with \nnational and sector M&E systems, it is therefore meaningful to strengthen ECD at the regional \nlevel in the framework of ADB's regional initiatives and the experience of DMCs. Here, the GMS \nEconomic Cooperation program is at the forefront of ADB's work on regional cooperation and \nintegration. GMS DMCs have recognized the shortcomings of their M&E systems, elements of \n                                                 \n5  See  ADB.  2007.

The regional cooperation strategy and \nprogram, 2004\u20132008, for the GMS that was approved in March 2004 emphasizes institutional \nstrengthening  to  develop  government  capacity  to  address  issues  comprehensively  and \neffectively and to better design and implement projects.11 The TA would help in planning for that. \nThe TA is the first of a multiyear, integrating instrument to develop regional capacity for M&E in \nthe Asia and Pacific region and generate ever-higher returns from that. It will mainstream \ncapacity development, another thematic priority of ADB.12\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact of the TA will be higher efficiency and effectiveness in providing public sector \nservices, leading to poverty reduction. In the evaluation agencies targeted,13 the outcome will \nbe improved ranges of skills, resources, systems, and attitudes for performance of results-\nbased M&E of country partnership strategies, sector strategies, policies, programs, and projects \nin GMS DMCs.14 Three outputs will accomplish the outcome of the TA: (i) proficiency in M&E \nwill be raised, (ii) research and special studies on ECD will be conducted, and (iii) knowledge \nsharing and learning for M&E will be boosted. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  Models of capacity development normally identify five interrelated dimensions: (i) an \nenabling environment, (ii) a sector network, (iii) an organization, (iv) agency staff, and (v) the \nend user. Fittingly, the TA tackles all five, with convergence on the evaluation agency staff as \ntargets of (i) dissemination of data and information, (ii) training, (iii) facilitation and mentoring, (iv) \nnetworking, and (v) feedback. It will ground inputs and activities in substantive demand for M&E. \nThe generation of outputs will be participatory, with multiparty commitment to follow through. \n \n7.  Raise Proficiency in M&E. Key activities to raise proficiency in tools, methods, and \napproaches for M&E will (i) extend regional training-of-trainers to selected evaluation agency \nstaff from GMS DMCs, and (ii) extend other similar national training-of-trainers to selected \nevaluation agency staff from GMS DMCs.15 Key activities to raise proficiency in strategy and \npolicy formulation for M&E will (i) strengthen the foundations for M&E in GMS DMCs with advice \non the regulatory framework and  institutional mandates, operational guidelines, as well as \nmethodological standards; (ii) assist GMS DMCs in setting long-term, consistent strategies by \nanalyzing existing M&E structures and practices, identifying major bottlenecks, and making \npolicy recommendations; and (iii) extend international training to selected senior evaluation \n                                                 \n11 On 21 June 2007, the 14th GMS ministerial meeting held in Manila endorsed a recommendation of the midterm \nreview of the 10-year GMS strategic framework, 2002\u20132012, seeking closer M&E of programs and projects of the \nGMS Economic Cooperation program, including its periodic independent review. Specifically, the recommendation \ncalled for a new GMS Plan of Action, consistent with the plans of action of the forums and working groups, detailing \nresults expected and indicators of performance and progress; time frames for implementation; and institutions \nresponsible for implementation and coordination. \n12 ADB. 2007. Integrating Capacity Development into Country Programs and Operations: Medium-Term Framework \nand Action Plan. Manila. \n13 Finance for the TA is limited. The evaluation agencies targeted will be key policy entities such as ministries of \nfinance or planning, public service commissions, one or two key line agencies, and relevant elements of civil \nsociety. Participants will be selected on the basis of their being able to act as focal or resource persons for 3\u20135 \nyears. \n14 This would include cross-border and subregional operations. \n15 The content, number, and duration of training modules will be discussed among the parties concerned. \n ", "4   \nagency staff from GMS DMCs. ADB's support will include funding of trainers, facilitators, and \nparticipants. Prior to this, the TA will explore which evaluation associations in countries with a \nculture of inquiry, such as Australia, Japan, and Malaysia, can support key activities, and define \nrelations. M&E of the training will be configured for a results orientation. \n \n8.  Conduct Research and Special Studies on ECD. Key activities will (i) support the \nformulation of country strategies for M&E, in the accomplishment of which ADB and other \ndevelopment assistance agencies might play a role; and (ii) suggest a strategy for ECD. Key \nactivities to support formulation of country strategies for M&E, in close collaboration with GMS \nDMCs, will (i) prioritize participating DMCs based on the demand for M&E;16 (ii) identify key \nministries and other bodies, and their formal or stated functions and relationships; (iii) diagnose \npublic sector incentives, ethics, and possible corruption, and determine what incentives and \nrules systems shape decision making; (iv) determine what influences budget decision making \nand line management, and examine actual roles and the extent of autonomy of central and line \nministries; (v) examine the extent of influence of evaluation on budget decision making and line \nmanagement;  (vi)  identify  evaluation  activities  of  central  and  line  ministries  and  other \norganizations; (vii) identify evaluation activities and roles of development assistance agencies, \nsuch as the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank, and opportunities to \nbuild  on  these;  (viii)  identify  major  public  sector  reforms  in  recent  years;  (ix)  map  out \nopportunities and options to develop evaluation capacity;17 and (x) prepare realistic action plans \nfor M&E.18 Drawing on the country strategies for M&E, key activities to suggest a strategy for \nECD will (i) justify, research, and analyze options for OED, including (a) transferring all or some \nresponsibility  for  ECD  to  other  departments  and  offices  in  ADB,  (b)  scaling  up  through \nintensified collaboration with other departments and offices or a more targeted approach to \noperational departments, and (c) placing a stronger accent on ECD; and (ii) argue a strategic \ndirection for ECD and its delivery design informed by a combination of (a) a demand for \nimproved  public  sector  performance,  including  its  specific  sources  and  characteristics,  (b) \nrestrictions on public sector performance and the development of effective evaluation of that \nperformance, and (c) options that flow out of ADB's broad strategic, policy, and institutional \ncontext. \n \n9.  Boost  Knowledge  Sharing  and  Learning  for  M&E. Key activities will (i) enhance \nselected  knowledge  sharing  and  learning  platforms  to  ensure  that  evaluation  agency  staff \nreceive feedback on the use to which their information is put, (ii) extend to evaluation agency \nstaff from GMS DMCs advice on new and existing knowledge networks on M&E, and (iii) \npromote and conclude partnership arrangements with interested evaluation associations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund,  provided  by  the \nGovernment of the PRC.19 The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n                                                 \n16 The principal indicators of demand will be the existing use of M&E for accountability, resource allocation, and \nlearning by governments and civil society. \n17 Options to promote evaluative activity will typically include (i) fostering a widespread culture of inquiry, (ii) \nimproving coordination and prioritization, and (iii) developing capability. \n18 Where demand for M&E is strong, a whole-of-government approach has advantages in achieving momentum and \nhelping to ensure that laggard ministries keep up with leading ministries. But a more achievable objective might be \nto start with an initial focus on ongoing performance monitoring, possibly in particular sectors or ministries so as to \ncreate a demonstration effect, and then seek to spread the approach to other sectors or ministries and to other \nperformance measurement tools (such as evaluation) as opportunities present themselves or can be created. \n19 GMS (and Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program) DMCs are a priority of the Fund. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be ADB. The provision of international training and \norganization of associated logistics will be entrusted to IPDET. The Asia-Pacific Finance and \nDevelopment Center (AFDC)20 will provide similar services for regional training through the \nShanghai International Program for Development Evaluation Training (SHIPDET).21 The GMS \nDMCs lack established programs for national training and that will be procured from the Center \nfor Development and Research in Evaluation (CeDRE) Malaysia, with a focus on in-country \ndelivery.22 CeDRE Malaysia will collaborate with AFDC for logistical support to SHIPDET. \n \n12.  CeDRE Malaysia will be selected directly to coordinate, supervise, and monitor overall \nactivities  under  the  TA.  It  specializes  in  capacity  development  for  public  sector  M&E  and \nintegrated performance management and has extensive international and regional experience, \nexpertise, capacity, and commitment.23 TA implementation will require an international M&E \nspecialist (team leader) for 6 person-months, and three national M&E specialists delivering 12 \nperson-months of consulting services each in each GMS DMC. CeDRE Malaysia will seek \nADB's approval when it sources the specialists. The key tasks of the team leader will be to (i) \nguide key activities to raise proficiency in formulating a strategy and policy for M&E; (ii) support \nthe formulation of country strategies for M&E; and (iii) suggest a strategy for ECD. The team \nleader will have primary expertise in M&E and secondary expertise in strategy and policy \nformulation  for  M&E.  Leadership,  managerial,  diplomatic,  and  negotiating  skills  and  long \nexperience with results-based management systems will be required. \n \n13.  ADB's  procedures  for  simplified  technical  proposals  will form  the  basis  for  contract \nnegotiations with CeDRE Malaysia. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). All equipment, \ngoods, and works required for the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented in October 2007\u2013\n2009. An indicative activities and staffing schedule is in Appendix 3. Outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of the People's Republic of China for Capacity Development for \nMonitoring and Evaluation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n20 Available: http://www.afdc.org.cn/en/index.asp.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n1.  Monitoring Results-Oriented Training \n \n7.  Training is a necessary, but usually not sufficient, tool to use together with others. For \nthat reason, one should pay attention to the \"why\" of training and not just to its \"how\". In a word, \ntraining serves to fortify or inculcate the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that an institution (or \nindividual) needs to achieve results. If planning and implementation of training are focused on \nimproving the performance of an institution, the likelihood of achieving intermediate results will \nbe enhanced. To configure an M&E system that links training to a goal and higher level result, \none should therefore ask the following questions: \n(i)  Higher  level  result. What changes in the performance of the institution will \ncontribute to the goal? \n(ii)  Institution-level  results.  What  kind  of  performance  will  be  required  of  the \ninstitution for it to attain the higher level result? \n(iii)  Group-level results. What does an analysis of the human resource capacity of \nthe institution reveal about the performance requirements needed to achieve the \ndesired results? \n(iv)  Training results. What gaps in performance can be addressed by training? \n \n8.  Once these questions are answered, the M&E system can then be configured based on \nthe illustrative framework outlined in Table A4.1: \n ", "    Appendix 4  15 \nTable A4.1: Monitoring Results-Oriented Training \n \nImpact  Higher Level  Institution- Group-Level  Training \nLogical Chain \nResult  Level Results  Results  Results \nResult  Higher efficiency  Improved  Improved  Trainee  Trainees \nand  performance of  performance of  performance  demonstrate the \neffectiveness in  institutional  institution  improves.  skills, \nproviding public  cluster  knowledge, and \nTraining is \nsector services,  attitudes \napplied in the \nleading to  acquired. \nworkplace or in \npoverty reduction \nthe community. \nGeneral  Higher efficiency  Improved ranges  Improved ranges  Training is  Trainees master \nIndicator  and  of skills,  of skills,  applied and  new skills and \neffectiveness in  resources,  resources,  shared in the  knowledge and \nproviding public  systems, and  systems, and  workplace.  demonstrate \nsector services ,  attitudes for  attitudes for  attitudes. \nleading to  performance\u2015in  performance\u2015in \npoverty reduction  the evaluation  the evaluation \nagencies  agency \ntargeted\u2015of  targeted\u2015of \nresults-based  results-based \nM&E of country  M&E of country \npartnership  partnership \nstrategies, sector  strategies, sector \nstrategies,  strategies, \npolicies,  policies, \nprograms, and  program, and \nprojects in GMS  projects in GMS \nDMCs  DMCs \nSpecific Indicator  TBD  TBD  TBD  TBD  TBD \nTimeline  5\u20138 years  4\u20136 years  2\u20133 years  6 months  Upon completion \nof training \nRole of Training  Component  Indirect plausible  Direct plausible  Directly linked to  Directly linked to \nin Achieving  attribution  link, given critical  link, given critical  training  training \nResults  assumptions  assumptions \nTBD = to be decided. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.

Meaningful specific indicators will detail (i) satisfaction levels; (ii) acquisition of new skills, \nknowledge, and attitudes; (iii) application of learning; and (iv) changes in performance.

When  configuring  the  M&E  system,  however,  it  will  be \nimportant to also specify who needs to know such results and how the results are to be \ncollected in a cost-effective way. \n \nC.  Reporting Requirements \n \n11.  CeDRE, acting through the team leader, will produce (i) an inception report within 2 \nweeks of the start of the TA, (ii) a work program within 6 weeks,2 (iii) a midterm report within 58 \nweeks, (iii) a draft final report within 90 weeks, and (iv) a final report detailing TA outcomes and \nrecommending  actions.

These notes, which should not exceed three pages, will keep relevant parties \ninformed  of  input-to-output  progress  and  constraints  impeding  TA  implementation.  A  TA \ncompletion questionnaire will evaluate the TA's outputs and activities, identify lessons learned, \nand suggest follow-up actions. It will inform an assessment of (i) the need for the TA, (ii) the \ndesign of the TA, (iii) the TA's outcome and impact, and (iv) the TA's cost and efficiency. \n \nD.  Dissemination of Results \n \n12.  The nature of the TA favors dissemination of results.
