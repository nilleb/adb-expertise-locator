I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed policy-based \nloans to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Second Capital Market Development Program. \nThe report also describes proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Enhancing Efficiency of the Capital Market, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve \nthe TA.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Capital  market  reforms  can  stabilize  the  economy  and  facilitate  sustainable  growth  by \naddressing the dual concern of boom and bust cycles in the stock markets as well as limited private \ninvestment that curtails long-term infrastructure financing options.   \n \n1.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n \n3.  Financial sector analysis. The financial sector and, in particular, the capital markets in \nBangladesh are in a fragile state. The stock markets are characterized by excessive volatility with \nrecurrent periods of boom and bust that tend to be a destabilizing force for the economy. The main \nDhaka index has fallen by about a half from its December 2010 all-time high corresponding to a loss \nof about 22% of gross domestic product (GDP) (about $27.1 billion) in market capitalization as of 23 \nOctober 2012. A high-level probe, set up by the Government of Bangladesh in 2011 to understand \nthe  deficiencies,  highlighted  limited  enforcement  of  regulation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission (SEC) and commercial banks\u2019 excessive investment in stock markets. \n \n4.  Despite  the  large  financing  needs  of  the  economy,  the  capital  markets  have  not  been \nparticularly effective in channeling savings to support investment and growth, and bank credit ended \nup fuelling the stock market boom. A similar situation was evidenced in the previous stock market \ncrash of December 1996. The proximate factors behind the boom and bust cycles include strained \nsupervisory  capacity  and  oversight  by  the  SEC,  lax  and  excessive  reliance  on  margin  lending \nrequirements,  unreliable  financial  reporting  standards,  and  weak  coordination  across  financial \nregulators. Weak investor confidence prevails in the capital markets and, therefore, limits demand for \nequities and bonds. This low market confidence is a result of the limited regulatory enforcement \neffectiveness of the SEC, lack of adjudication of securities cases (all securities cases of the 1996 \ncrash are still pending), poor corporate governance, as well as weak governance and operation of \nthe stock exchanges. A lack of sustainable long-term infrastructure financing options also persists in \nthe economy because of limited capital market development.  \n \n5.  Domestic capital markets do not play a significant role in financial intermediation and resource \nmobilization in the economy. While savings intermediated by banks amounted to 8.3% of GDP (30% \nof national savings), capital raised through equity and bond issues together was equivalent to only \n0.07% of GDP in fiscal year (FY) 2012. The economy also remains over-reliant on bank financing \n(total bank assets of more than 80% of the country\u2019s financial assets) that are unable to finance the \ninfrastructure investments that the country requires because this would expose banks to credit risks \nsuch as maturity mismatch issues. The bond market remains in its nascent stage, undermining long-\nterm infrastructure financing requirements. The total bond market is only 5% of GDP (the government \nbond market is 4% of GDP, while the corporate bond market is 1% of GDP), which is significantly \nless than that of other large South Asian countries. Attempts to strengthen financial system stability \nhave  faced  resistance  by  certain  vested  interests  in  support  of  the  status  quo  that  promotes \ngovernment influence over the capital markets. Mutual fund participation in capital markets is very \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2 \n \nlimited (mutual fund capitalization is less than 1% of GDP, which is low compared to other large \nSouth Asian countries), and investment restrictions on insurance companies, as well as pension \nfunds,  limit  their  role  in  financing  government  securities  and  perpetuating  a  situation  of  fiscal \ndominance.2  \n \n6.  If Bangladesh is to increase its GDP growth and attain its annual target of 10% by FY2021 \n(para. 7), it will have to address structural deficiencies in the capital markets by deregulating the \nfinancial system to better support the real economy and promote private sector investment to reduce \nthe infrastructure deficit, which is a major constraint to its sustainable and higher economic growth. A \npolicy framework is required for (i) financial markets stabilization following the history of booms and \nbusts  as  well  as  (ii)  sustainable  capital  market  growth  through  liberalizing  investment  decisions, \nremoving distortions, and promoting stronger supervision and governance of the markets. Correcting \nthe existing legal and regulatory framework, continuing improvements to the market infrastructure \n(stock  market  surveillance  system),  and  empowering  institutions  (e.g.,  the  SEC)  by  reducing \ngovernment tutelage are crucial to develop a more stable and resilient financial system.  \n \n7.  Growth  imperative  and  infrastructure  challenge.  Vision  20213 lays  out  a  vision  for \nBangladesh to attain middle income status by 2021. It sets targets of reaching 8% GDP annual \ngrowth by FY2015 and 10% by FY2021. The Government of Bangladesh\u2019s Sixth Five-Year Plan, \nFY2011\u2013FY20154 therefore includes a growth strategy to boost the rate of private investment and \nfoster structural change. It focuses on accelerating the growth rate to 7.3% on average during the \nperiod covered by the plan and reducing poverty by substantially boosting private sector investment \nthat will be primarily deployed to reduce the infrastructure constraint.  \n \n8.  Acceleration of the growth rate will require a substantial increase in the investment rate from \nthe present 24.4% of GDP to 32.5% of GDP by FY2015 and to 38%\u201340% of GDP by FY2021. Since \nmost of the additional increase in the growth of investment will come from the private sector, policy \nreforms are envisioned under the Sixth Five-Year Plan to improve incentives for private investment \nsuch  as  providing  sustainable  long-term  infrastructure  financing  options  through  capital  market \ndevelopment. The absence of a developed capital market reduces the range of viable options for \ncompanies and borrowers seeking finance for growth, and places undue pressure on a banking \nsector that may not be in a strong enough prudential or credit position to offer essential long-term \nfinancing for infrastructure projects, which are in turn a prerequisite to support growth. Thus, capital \nmarket development is critical to address the current infrastructure investment gap in Bangladesh \nand, therefore, serve as a vehicle for long-term sustainable growth.  \n \n2.  Analysis of Key Problems  \n \n9.  The stock market debacle of December 2010 reflects the vulnerable state of Bangladesh\u2019s \ncapital market and represents a convergence of factors that underpin inadequacies of the existing \nsystem as well as the present policies and practices that are not sustainable. The most critical \nproblem  is  that  of  government  tutelage  over  the  capital  markets,  which  holds  back  sector \ndevelopment and constrains responsible institutions from carrying out their mandates effectively. This \ncombined with strong vested interest results in an entrenched status quo.  \n \n                                                 \n2  Fiscal pressures intensified as subsidy costs for fuel, electricity, food, and fertilizer increased, expanding government \ndomestic borrowing and putting liquidity pressures on banks. Net credit to government, which grew rapidly by 35.0% in \nFY2011, shot up to 62.4% in the 12 months prior to January 2012. Pressure on balance of payments is expected to \nintensify in FY2012 and FY2013, with larger import payments relative to export and remittance receipts. \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, Ministry of Planning. 2010.

The SEC\u2019s operational and financial efficiency is constrained since \nit is shackled under the SEC Act, 1993. The government issues directives to the SEC and also \ncontrols its appointments, budget, expenditures, and pay scales. The SEC cannot access its $10 \nmillion SEC Fund (a fund generated solely from SEC fees, charges, and levies) for its operations \nwithout prior government approval. As a result, the SEC has a limited remit as far as supervision and \nmarket development is concerned and limited resources to pursue its relatively narrow mandate \neffectively. Although its oversight and regulatory functions have more than doubled, SEC staffing \nremains inadequate and its remuneration structure is not attractive to potential qualified applicants \nfrom the private sector. The enforcement effectiveness of the SEC has been challenged by the lack \nof  resources  and  extremely  slow  pace  of  resolution  of  cases  pending  in  the  court  system  in \nBangladesh. A total of 366 SEC cases are pending with various courts, which includes 15 cases \nbrought as a result of the stock market crisis of 1996. The SEC also does not have effective \nautomated surveillance systems that can detect as well as prevent market abuses and malpractices. \nThis has affected market confidence, which has often been cited by investors as one of the major \nconstraints in the development of the capital market. \n \n11.  Limited  financial  stability  oversight  and  policy  coordination.  In  October  2009, \nBangladesh Bank required commercial banks to establish separate merchant bank subsidiaries to \nconduct capital market activities in an attempt to limit the exposure of the banking system to the \ncapital market. Although Bangladesh Bank remained responsible for the overall supervision of the \ncommercial banks and their market exposure, direct oversight of their merchant bank subsidiaries \nbecame the responsibility of the SEC. As a result, Bangladesh Bank\u2019s supervision of the banking \nsystem was fragmented and became directly dependent on the quality of SEC oversight of merchant \nbanks and the need for effective SEC supervision, as well as greater coordination and information \nsharing between the SEC and Bangladesh Bank. The absence of a high level forum and, ultimately, \nof agreements that would enable Bangladesh Bank, the SEC, and other financial market regulators to \nshare information as well as coordinate financial sector oversight and policy issues on a regular basis \nhas impaired Bangladesh Bank\u2019s ability to effectively supervise commercial banks and limited the \napplication of prudential standards. In particular, the lack of coordination among financial sector \nregulators has led to opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. \n \n12.  Weak regulation, governance, and operation of stock exchanges. The management of \neach of the two stock exchanges, Dhaka Stock Exchange and Chittagong Stock Exchange, is unable to \nregulate and supervise its members\u2019 activities effectively; the exchanges are owned and dominated by \nbrokers whose businesses take precedence over the governance of their exchanges and overall \nmarket development. Therefore, the exchanges are not responsive to the needs of their issuers and \ninvestors since the members and/or brokers are preventing direct and cost effective access to the \nexchanges. The exchanges\u2019 objectives are to manage the interests of the not-for-profit closed member-\nbased organization with a central focus on providing services for the benefit primarily of the members \nand/or brokers and keeping costs and investments limited to financing agreed by members. Both \nexchanges failed to discipline their members and/or traders with regard to irregular trading. The mutual \ngovernance  structure  of  the  exchanges  deters  the  appointment  of  a  professional  board  and \nmanagement, and limits appropriate investments in automated trading to offer competitive services that \nare  essential  for  developing  modern  and  efficient  securities  exchanges;  therefore,  it  is  a  major \nconstraint in the drive for innovation and overall development of the capital market. \n \n13.  Weak  institutional  investor  and  mutual  fund  industry  demand.  The  participation  of \ninstitutional  investors,  such  as  the  insurance  industry,  is  limited.  The  insurance  industry  of \nBangladesh  is  still  comparatively  underdeveloped  as  market  penetration  at  1%  or  2%  of  the \npopulation is low by international standards. The Insurance Act of 2010 is the industry\u2019s governing \nlegislation, and the Insurance Development and Regulatory Authority (IDRA) is the new regulator. \nHowever, most of the new regulatory legislation, such as investment regulations and recapitalization \nmeasures, has yet to be adopted. With regard to mutual fund demand, major impediments in the \n ", "4 \n \nSEC (Mutual Fund) Rules, 2001 that currently curtail mutual fund growth are (i) limits on the types of \nentities that can sponsor or operate a mutual fund, (ii) limits on investment flexibility that prevent the \ncreation of certain funds (such as index funds), (iii) investment discretion limited by the requirement \nof 75% equity securities, and (iv) the competitive advantages of the Investment Corporation of \nBangladesh (ICB)\u2014including special tax advantages\u2014that create an uneven playing field between \nICB funds and the rest of the industry.  \n \n14.  Limited supply and demand of equities. High listing costs prevail because of the imposition \nof an initial public offering tax. The accounting and auditing standards of listed companies are also \nunreliable  and  lack  facts  for  informed  investment  decisions.  Beyond  the  unreliability  of  financial \nreporting is the issuer\u2019s concern over poor corporate governance. The corporate governance structure \nof listed companies is not sufficiently transparent and lacks proper checks and balances.  \n \n15.  Limited  supply  and  demand  of  bonds.  The  prevalence  of  fiscal  dominance  prevents \ncompetitive auctioning of government securities based on market prices. The operating framework of \nthe primary dealer system does not promote competitive bidding because under current practice \ndevolvement or lowest price bidding absorbs up to 70% of allocated issuance. This financial repression \nimpedes the development of a secondary government bond market because primary pricing does not \nreflect market fundamentals and the primary dealers are, therefore, inclined to hold their portfolio of \ngovernment securities until maturity to minimize losses. The development of the secondary government \nbond market is also hindered by too many issues of government securities (250 plus) and the average \nsize of each issue ($50 million) being too small, which prevents the creation of liquid benchmark issues. \nThe corporate bond market therefore hardly exists in Bangladesh because of the absence of a credible \ngovernment yield curve and liquid bond market. Furthermore, the approval process for corporate bond \nissuance is slow and onerous (3\u20136 months), and the issuance costs are high by regional standards. \nThe development of asset-backed securities is also hindered because of stamp duties on the transfer \nof assets and taxes on income passed through a special purpose vehicle. \n      \n3.  Analysis of Opportunities  \n \n16.  The recent episode of stock market volatility provides an opportunity to redefine the regulatory \npartnerships to augment transparency, fairness, and effectiveness as well as compliance, which \nwould lead to enhanced trust and confidence in Bangladesh\u2019s capital markets. The SEC should \nenable a reformed regulatory partnership that defines the proper role of classes of participants as \nwell as ensures that each participant carries out its responsibilities.  \n \n17.  Strengthening  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  in  areas  of  regulation, \nsurveillance,  and  enforcement. The operational and financial efficiency of the SEC should be \nenhanced by allowing unhindered access to the SEC Fund. This would entail removal of government \napproval of the SEC budget or expenditures from the SEC Fund as well as delegating hiring and pay \nscale determination to the SEC. The SEC\u2019s inspection, investigation, and enforcement capacity \nneeds to be strengthened to more fully meet its current and future regulatory obligations and promote \nmarket stability. This should be complemented by expedited adjudication of enforcement actions \nthrough the establishment of a special capital market tribunal to hear capital market-related cases \nand the development of a real-time market surveillance system to help the SEC detect trading \nirregularities and market abuse as they occur. The installation of such a state-of-the-art surveillance \nsystem would increase transparency of market transactions and contribute significantly to enhanced \ninvestor confidence. The operationalization of this system is being undertaken by an ongoing ADB \nTA loan.5  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2006. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Improvement of Capital Market and Insurance Governance Project. Manila. ", "5 \n \n18.  Enhancing  financial  stability  through  improved  coordination  between  regulators. \nEnhanced coordination is required among the agencies with mandates for financial sector oversight. \nThe banks\u2019 involvement directly and indirectly through subsidiaries overseen by the SEC illustrate \nthat major policy issues cannot be dealt with through single functional silos. Practical implementation \nmeasures should include making the council of financial regulatory agencies an effective body for \nfinancial sector oversight. The council, which includes all the agencies with mandates for financial \nstability and financial sector oversight\u2014Bangladesh Bank, the SEC, the IDRA, and the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), should adopt a specific mandate to include (i) macro-prudential oversight of the \nfinancial system and contingency planning, (ii) a forum for the review of financial sector policy issues \nand the identification of needed amendments to the legal and regulatory framework, and (iii) a high-\nlevel forum for coordination and information sharing for the purposes of consolidated supervision. \n \n19.  Demutualization of stock exchanges. The demutualization of the stock exchanges would \nsegregate ownership, management, and trading rights of members and convert the two exchanges \ninto commercial and more professionally run organizations that would enable them to pursue their \nstrategic  interests,  including  market  development,  with  more  vigor.  A  governance  structure \nrepresenting all stakeholders and encouraging competition amongst trading members will develop \nthe capital market of the country and attract new investors. The exchanges will be less susceptible to \nmembers\u2019 vested interests. The demutualization would also facilitate the development of crucial new \ntechnology-related infrastructure through alternative methods of raising capital. \n \n20.  Enhancing  institutional  investor  demand  and  promoting  the  mutual  fund  industry. \nInsurance industry participation in the capital market should be enhanced by introducing measures to \npromote  the  industry\u2019s  growth  and  stability,  such  as  compliance  with  the  minimum  capital \nrequirements of the Insurance Act of 2010, and encouraging investor demand through the issuance \nof investment guidelines by the IDRA. A robust mutual fund industry can be promoted by rule \nchanges that (i) remove restrictions that prohibit brokers, portfolio managers, and merchant bankers \nfrom sponsoring or operating a mutual fund; (ii) permit the creation of different types of funds; (iii) \nallow  investment  discretion  (less  than  75%  of  equity  investment);  and  (iv)  require  the  funds \nsponsored by the ICB to be fully compliant with all mutual fund regulations. \n \n21.  Enhancing the supply and demand of equities. The accounting and auditing standards \nshould be upgraded to enhance market confidence and allow for informed investment decisions. \nEnactment of the Financial Reporting Act would establish an independent financial reporting council \nto adopt, monitor, and enforce International Accounting Standards and International Standards of \nAuditing for public interest entities as well as license auditors and accountants. The SEC should \nestablish high international standards of accounting and auditing to ensure the quality and reliability \nof filed financial information through creation of an office of chief accountant. The SEC code of \ncorporate governance should be adopted to strengthen accounting policies and transparency of listed \ncompanies. It would lead to the creation of an audit committee to supervise companies\u2019 internal \ncontrols, accounting policies, and compliance with International Accounting Standards. In line with \ninternational best practices, removing the initial public offering tax would also spur the supply of \nequities since it would incentivize equity financing. \n \n22.  Enhancing the supply and demand of bonds. To develop a liquid bond market and reliable \nyield curve, the government should be a price-taker by issuing treasury bills and bonds at market \nrates. A strategy of creating liquid benchmark issues should be pursued by reducing the number of \nissues and increasing the average size of issues by re-opening existing issues. The initial focus \nshould be on smaller tenors since these are easier for the market to price, especially in a high \ninflation environment. Longer tenors can be developed as the market matures. An ongoing ADB TA \ngrant is supporting measures related to public debt management.6 The corporate bond market can be \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "6 \n \ncatalyzed  by  implementing  a  fast-track  regulatory  process  for  private  placements  that  balances \ninvestor protection with the ease of approval. Tax breaks, such as the elimination of transaction taxes \nfor bonds, would also trigger bond market activity, and stamp duty relief would catalyze asset-backed \nsecurities.  \n \n4.  Government Policy Support for Capital Market Development \n \n23.  To achieve GDP growth rate targets outlined in Vision 2021 and the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the \ngovernment recognizes the need to strengthen macroeconomic management, deepen policy and \nregulatory  reform,  and  improve  the  incentive  structure  for  encouraging  private  investment.  The \ninvestment requirement for the Sixth Five-Year Plan is an estimated Tk13.3 trillion, of which the \ngovernment is expected to provide 22% and the private sector to provide the rest. Policy reforms are \ntherefore envisioned under the Sixth Five-Year Plan to improve incentives for private investment. \nThese incentives include providing long-term financing options through capital market development. \nThe key envisaged capital market development reforms include (i) strengthened market surveillance \nby the SEC; (ii) improved regulations with respect to accounting rules, governance structure, and \nreporting requirements; and (iii) greater coordination between Bangladesh Bank and the SEC on \nstock market policies, including issues related to commercial banks\u2019 exposure to the capital market.  \n \n5.  ADB Support for Capital Market Development \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s financial sector strategy for Bangladesh, which is included in the country partnership \nstrategy7 and the new country operations business plan,8 is based on the Sixth Five-Year Plan, lessons \nfrom ADB\u2019s previous financial sector interventions, and coordination with other development partners. \nIn line with the Sixth Five-Year Plan and ADB\u2019s Strategy 20209 priorities, capital market development \nand bond market development focusing on the provision of long-term infrastructure is one of ADB\u2019s \nfocus areas in its Bangladesh public sector operations. Strategy 2020 includes support for capital \nmarket development as one of ADB\u2019s core operational priorities because it can facilitate private sector \ndevelopment and infrastructure development, which rely on the availability of long-term local currency \nfunds for viable financial structures. The proposed program is fully aligned with the government\u2019s Sixth \nFive-Year Plan, ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, and ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy with Bangladesh. ADB \nwill  provide  assistance  for  capital  market  development  in  2012  to  complement  and  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to meaningful capital market reform.  \n \n6.

The  proposed  program  will  build  on  lessons  from  the  first  Capital  Market  Development \nProgram10 based on its program performance audit report11 and a review carried out by the ADB \nIndependent  Evaluation  Department  on  ADB\u2019s  assistance  for  domestic  capital  markets.12 Major \nlessons were as follows: (i) a comprehensive reform program can be feasible only if it is an integral \npart of a government-owned long-term development strategy13 and if there is ownership at the \nhighest levels of government and the private sector; (ii) the number of program measures should be \nlimited so that ADB can monitor compliance with them throughout the program; and (iii) there should \nbe adequate consultation with private and public sector stakeholders while forming capital market \nreform programs. In line with key recommendations of both evaluation studies, the efficiency and \neffectiveness of the proposed program is facilitated by (i) a limited number of policy actions to \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2011.

", "7 \n \nmonitor program compliance effectively, (ii) the formulation of a long-term national capital market \nmaster plan as a first tranche policy action to ensure that the new program is an integral part of a \ngovernment-owned  long-term  development  strategy  (milestones  for  release  of  first  and  second \ntranches form an integral part of this master plan), and (iii) a comprehensive consultation with \nstakeholders through numerous national workshops to effectively diagnose the issues leading to a \nstrong and relevant proposed policy matrix.14  \n \n7.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n26.  The  development  partner  coordination  arrangement  is  guided  by  the  Bangladesh  Joint \nCooperation Strategy, 2010\u20132015,15 which is based on the principles of the Paris Declaration on Aid \nEffectiveness (2005) and the Accra Agenda for Action (2008). The World Bank, the International \nMonetary  Fund,  and  ADB  are  the  key  development  partners  supporting  the  government  in \nundertaking financial sector reforms. The World Bank\u2019s program focuses on the banking sector, and \nADB is the lead development partner for capital market development. ADB retains this role under the \nproposed program, which builds upon policy reform measures implemented under the first Capital \nMarket Development Program. In April 2012, the International Monetary Fund approved a 3-year \nExtended Credit Facility of about $1 billion for Bangladesh with the main objectives of restoring \nmacroeconomic stability and strengthening the external position. The Extended Credit Facility will \nalso  strengthen  financial  sector  governance  to  manage  risks  and  support  growth  centered  on \nmanagerial and operational controls in banks, particularly state-owned ones. The first installment of \nthe Extended Credit Facility has been disbursed to date. The proposed program\u2019s emphasis on \ncapital market development neatly complements the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Credit \nFacility role in strengthening the banking sector. The World Bank\u2019s major ongoing project in the \nfinancial sector includes the Central Bank Strengthening Project16 that supports Bangladesh Bank in \nterms of legal framework as well as reorganization and modernization.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n27.  The program\u2019s impact will be a well-functioning financial system that supports basic capital \nand investment needs, as well as Bangladesh\u2019s longer-term economic objectives. The program\u2019s \noutcome will be a deeper and more stable capital market. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n28.  The program outputs include (i) strengthened market stability by enhancing SEC\u2019s role to \ndevelop the market, promoting financial stability through joint supervision of the financial system, \nstrengthening regulatory measures, and developing a market surveillance system; (ii) enhanced \nmarket facilitation by developing a long-term vision for capital markets, upgrading accounting and \nauditing standards, expediting adjudication of enforcement actions, improving governance of listed \ncompanies, and pursuing demutualization of the stock exchanges;  (iii) enhanced supply measures \nby  incentivizing  the  issuance  of  equities  and  bonds;  and  (iv)  enhanced  demand  measures  by \ndeveloping liquid bond markets and catalyzing institutional investor demand. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs  \n \n29.  The program loan size is $300 million; it will be released in two equal tranches of $150 million \nequivalent. The first tranche will be available upon loan effectiveness. The government requested a \nloan  of  $95  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources.  The  loan  will  have  a  15-year  term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \n                                                 \n14 Three national stakeholder and dissemination workshops were held during program formulation that were attended by \n183 registered participants across 34 different organizations. \n15 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh. 2010.

The \ngovernment also requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR101,839,000 from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources  (regular  term)  and  another  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to \nSDR32,851,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources (hard term). The loans from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources will each have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate \nof 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan and program agreements. The loan size is determined based on \nthe cost of adjustment arising from the proposed reforms.17 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The executing agency will be the Bank and Financial Institutions Division (BFID) of the MOF. \nThe implementing agency will be the SEC. The program will be supported by other key government \nagencies (including Bangladesh Bank) that are responsible for undertaking numerous policy actions. \nThe program is being implemented from June 2011 to June 2014. An inter-agency monitoring and \ntracking committee was established in July 2012 to help drive the reforms in preparation of the first \ntranche policy reform measures. The agencies under the committee include MOF, Bangladesh Bank, \nNational Board of Revenue, SEC, and IDRA. After compliance with first tranche policy actions, a \nsteering committee will implement the remaining program that will be chaired by the BFID Secretary. \nThis steering committee will comprise of the same members as the tracking committee as well as \nmembers of the stock exchanges. The committee will be supported by a secretariat comprised of \nstaff  with  requisite  technical  skills.  Loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nsimplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans.18 ADB will \nhave the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s \ncertification. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n31.  In  addition  to  program  support  from  an  ongoing  TA  loan  (footnote  5)  and  a  capacity \ndevelopment TA project (footnote 6), an attached TA will provide crucial resources to support the \nimplementation of key reform actions under the program. The major outputs and activities of the TA \nwill include (i) strengthened enforcement capacity of the SEC by ensuring an effective structure for \ndetecting  and  investigating  possible  violations  of  securities  laws  and  regulations  as  well  as \nformulating and prosecuting cases; (ii) expedited adjudication of enforcement actions by promoting \nmechanisms to ensure disposition of capital market cases such as the establishment of a separate \ntribunal;  and  (iii)  improved  regulation,  governance,  and  operation  of  the  stock  exchanges  by \nfacilitating the demutualization process in the Dhaka Stock Exchange and the Chittagong Stock \nExchange. The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office accommodation and transport, remuneration and per diem of \ncounterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The executing agency for the TA will be the BFID of \nthe MOF. The SEC will be the implementing agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over 2 \nyears,  starting  in  December  2012.  ADB  will  engage  consultants  through  a  consulting  firm  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                 \n17 The estimated cost of adjustment across program outputs are: (i) $20 million for market stability (additional SEC staff \ntime, coordination committee staff time, maintenance and operation cost of SEC surveillance equipment); (ii) $150 million \nfor market facilitation (costs of demutualization and establishment of a capital markets tribunal, operation costs of the \nFinancial Reporting Council and its tribunal); (iii) $10 million for supply measures (foregone revenue on IPO tax, bond \ntransaction tax, and stamp duties); and (iv) $150 million for demand measures (cost of paying market prices for \ngovernment securities as well as additional IDRA staff). \n18 ADB. 1998.

The program will facilitate mobilization of financial resources for productive investment and \nemployment generation by supporting the development of bond and equity capital markets. The \nprogram will help to ensure the balanced development of the financial sector, which will reduce \nsystemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated financial system. Specific benefits are as follows:  \n(i)  By addressing policy and regulatory constraints to the issues of corporate securities, \nthe program will help to increase the number of bond and equity issues, both primary \nand secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of scarce financial resources for \nlong-term private sector investment, including infrastructure investment.  \n(ii)  By promoting the development of corporate securities markets and institutional investors, \nthereby diversifying financial instruments and broadening the investor base, the program \nwill reduce market volatility and improve resilience of the financial sector to external \nshocks. ADB is currently supporting implementation of a TA to strengthen capacity at \nBangladesh Bank including in the area of financial stability (footnote 6). \n(iii)  By strengthening market governance in capital markets, the program will enhance \nmarket efficiency and transparency, as well as improve investor protection.  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  Public Financial Management (PFM) reform has been undertaken to make resource allocation \nmore effective, prioritize spending, and increase budget execution capability. The government recently \nimplemented comprehensive governance reforms including establishment of an independent Anti-\nCorruption Commission in 2004, separation of the judiciary from the executive in 2007, enactment of \nthe Right to Information Act, 2009 and immediate establishment of the Information Commission. A new \napproach to budget planning was adopted by the government with the introduction of the Medium Term \nBudget Framework in all line ministries and establishment of an integrated budget and accounting \nsystem in 2009 that connected accounting offices in all the districts and chief accounts offices of the \nline ministries with the Ministry of Finance. Under the Public Money and Budget Management Act, 2009 \nthe Finance Minister is required to submit quarterly progress reports to the Parliament on the utilization \nof budgeted appropriations and progress in public expenditure management. Furthermore, greater \nresponsibility and accountability has been assigned to the SEC under this program through clear rules \nof engagement under the amended SEC Act, 1993 that is contributing to improved governance in the \nfinancial system. In October 2012, the National Integrity Strategy was approved by the government and \nsupported by ADB\u2019s Good Governance Program19 which represents a comprehensive institutional \napproach to fight corruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nand discussed with the government and the BFID of the MOF. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n34.  The capital market reforms under the program will play an important role in raising funds cost-\neffectively and in enabling investors to gain access to alternative investment opportunities, as well as \nmitigating  the  negative  impact  that  financial  market  instability  has  on  the  plight  of  the  poor. \nDiversification away from a predominantly bank-based system of financial intermediation expands \nalternative sources of credit, thereby helping to limit systemic impacts of economic shocks. Capital \nmarkets can stimulate healthy competition with the banking sector that results in lower financing \ncosts for all borrowers. The program, therefore, emphasizes specific capital market reforms to help \nBangladesh diversify its financial system so that the country can realize its broad-based economic \ngrowth and socioeconomic development objectives\u2014including poverty reduction. \n                                                 \n19  ADB. 2007.

The capital market reforms under the program are likely to have no adverse environmental \nimpacts.  Therefore,  the  program\u2019s  environment  category  is  assigned  as  C.  Similarly,  since  the \nprogram has no involuntary resettlement impacts, the program\u2019s involuntary resettlement category is \nassigned as C. The program\u2019s indigenous peoples category is also assigned as C.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  Risks to the program include political instability, resistance to reforms from vested interests, \nand PFM. Mitigating measures entail strong political will and commitment to pursue capital market \nreforms (para. 33). PFM reform has been undertaken through the public expenditure and financial \naccountability partnership that supports harmonized approaches to assessment and reform for public \nexpenditure, procurement, and financial accountability. Major risks and mitigating measures are \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.20 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n37.  The government and the BFID of the MOF have assured ADB that the implementation of the \nprogram  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in \ndetail in the loan documents.  \n \n38.  The government and the BFID of the MOF have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for \nthe program, which are set forth in the loan agreements and program agreement.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the  loan  of  $95,000,000  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Second \nCapital Market Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft loan and program agreements presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR101,839,000 to the People\u2019s Republic \nof  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Capital  Market  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (regular term), with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program \nagreements presented to the Board; and  \n(iii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR32,851,000 to the People\u2019s Republic \nof  Bangladesh  for  the  Second  Capital  Market  Development  Program  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (hard term), with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 24 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  program \nagreements presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n6  November 2012\n                                                 \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
