THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation support \nto a series of ensuing projects, including (i) Federated States of Micronesia Climate Resilient \nEnergy and Water Project ($43 million), (ii) Republic of the Marshall Islands Electrification Project \n($10 million), and (iii) Solomon Islands Sustainable Solar Development Investment Program \n($50 million). The TA facility will support required due diligence, provide project preparation and \nprocurement support, capacity building, and policy recommendations for ensuing projects, which \nare planned for approval in 2022\u20132025 under the Indicative Country Pipeline and Monitoring \nReport for Eleven Small Pacific Island Countries (PIC-11), 2022\u20132024. The TA facility is listed in \nthe Regional Operations Business Plan for 2021\u20132023 and aligned with Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030 operational priorities 2, 3, and 7, as well as the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change.1 Two of the three main \nobjectives of the Pacific Approach, 2021\u20132025 are \u201cpreparing for and responding to shocks\u201d and \n\u201cdelivering sustainable services,\u201d areas in which renewable energy-based electricity generation \nhas a key role to play.2 \n \n2.  Development context. The PIC-11 are among ADB\u2019s smallest developing member \ncountries (DMCs) by population size, and 10 of them are included in the world\u2019s 25 smallest \ncountries. These small island developing states tend to share similar development challenges, \nincluding  small  populations,  limited  resources,  remoteness,  susceptibility  to  disasters, \nvulnerability to external shocks, and excessive dependence on international trade. Six of the PIC-\n11 are classified as fragile and conflict-afflicted situations, characterized by weak governance and \ninstitutional capacity, economic and social insecurity, and greater vulnerability to the effects of \nclimate change and natural hazards.  \n \n3.  The Pacific DMCs are committed to improving energy security and reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions and have set ambitious targets for renewable electricity generation by 2025\u20132030.3  \nThe global deployment of renewable energy in recent years has been rapid, mostly due to \nmanufacturing economies of scale, an exponential decline in hardware costs, and resultant \ngreater affordability. Battery and other energy storage technologies are more available and \naffordable for improving network reliability and stability, which is helping increase the share of \nrenewable electricity.4 However, the implementation of renewable energy programs has been \ninsufficient  to  meet  renewable  energy  targets  and  nationally  determined  contribution \ncommitments. The share of renewable energy in the Pacific subregion has increased less than \n20% since 2015. Diesel and other petroleum fuels remain the primary sources of the energy mix \nin most Pacific DMCs.  \n \n4.  Energy security. The Pacific DMCs rely on imported fuels for bulk power generation at \nan estimated cost of over $1.5 billion annually (footnote 4). The average fuel import bills in the \nPacific DMCs are about 25% of total imports and over 10% of gross domestic product. Fuel \nimports are vulnerable to severe weather events, which are exacerbated by climate change. This \ndependence on energy imports exposes Pacific DMCs to fuel price shocks and a higher risk of \npower outages if supply is interrupted.  \n \n1   ADB. 2020.

This information is being disclosed to the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Access to Information Policy. ", "2   \n5.  Insufficient funding for climate-resilient energy. Pacific utilities are heavily dependent \non public funds, with limited or no access to private capital for energy investments. With fuel \nexpenses making up more than 65% of generation costs, renewable energy is key to reducing \noperating costs. The Pacific DMCs require an estimated $500 million of investments annually until \n2030 to meet renewable energy targets, which far exceeds envisioned public funding.5 Some \nPacific DMCs have prioritized the transition to renewable energy by designing projects to be \nimplemented with commercial investment through independent power producers (IPPs). While \nrobust power purchase agreements are instrumental for hedging IPPs\u2019 risks, the power utilities \ncontinue to underperform with weak transmission and distribution grids and limited evacuation \ncapacity for renewable energy produced by IPPs. Due to the combination of the high costs of \nenergy supply and public service obligations and limited operating budgets, most utilities defer \ngrid maintenance, which results in poor service reliability and unscheduled interruptions.   \n \n6.  High cost of energy. Electricity costs in the Pacific are among the highest in the world. \nThe reliance on imported fuel is reflected in the high generation and retail tariffs estimated at an \naverage of $0.33 per kilowatt-hour and $0.42 per kilowatt-hour, respectively (footnote 5). Under \npresent tariff regimes, electric power utilities can pass fuel costs directly to consumers and charge \nan inflation-indexed nonfuel tariff. Volatile fuel prices and heavy reliance on imported fuel for \npower generation negatively affect the economy and living standards. To mitigate the high cost \nof electricity, the Pacific DMCs maintain various retail price subsidies and community service \nobligation programs, compensating the most vulnerable households and communities. However, \npublic resources are not sufficient to fund both energy subsidization schemes and other critical \nsocial programs (health, education, etc.) funded by the governments.  \n \n7.  Coronavirus disease pandemic. Energy sector resilience and security in the Pacific \nsubregion has been identified as an urgent need during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. Power utilities have been one of the most severely affected, many of which were not \nin a strong financial position before the pandemic. Reductions in energy demand due to COVID-\n19 lockdowns have reduced revenues, but operational costs have not decreased. These utilities \nhave experienced the combination of decreased revenues as demand declined and reduced \npayment  from  end-consumers  who  are  less  able  to  pay  because  of  the  pandemic.  Many \ngovernments have provided financial support to both end-users and energy utilities to mitigate \nthese issues, which could affect the ability to finance the utilities\u2019 capital investments. While the \nCOVID-19 pandemic has reduced the cost of imported fuel, the Pacific DMCs experienced \nsignificant supply challenges caused by transportation delays and limited storage capacity due to \noutdated infrastructure.  \n \n8.  Pacific DMCs can produce power that is lower in cost than fossil fuel generation, providing \nthe economic incentives (i.e., preferential taxation, customs, etc.) and access to capital to deploy \nclean  energy  technologies  to  harvest  indigenous  renewable  resources.  Alongside  this, \ninvestments  in  climate-resilient  electricity  grids  are  needed  to  reduce  the  cost  of  power \ntransmission in the Pacific DMCs. ADB is well-placed to support these investments along with \nstrengthening governance, policy, and planning that may otherwise prove to be a weak link in the \ntransition to lower-carbon energy systems. Aligning these investments with COVID-19 recovery \nstimulus can leverage development progress while meeting climate change goals and ensuring \nthat energy infrastructure is in place to support the economic recovery of the Pacific DMCs.  \n \n9.  Pacific  energy  development  priorities.  The  Pacific  DMCs  formulated  their  vision, \n\u201cFramework for Energy Security and Resilience in the Pacific (2021\u20132030)\u201d (footnote 4), with the \n \n5  Pacific Power Utilities. 2020.

", "3 \naim to develop climate-resilient power generation and distribution infrastructure for the Pacific \n(Policy Target 10). The Pacific DMCs recognize the strong link between energy and sustainable \nand  resilient  economic  growth,  and  the  urgency  to  sustain  energy  supply  by  modernizing \ninfrastructure and promoting reliable and clean energy generation. ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach also \nprioritizes clean energy investments in: (i) battery storage to support grid stability and higher \npenetration rates of renewables; (ii) improvements to the technical and commercial performance \nof utilities by building capacity and helping rationalize tariffs; and (iii) public\u2013private partnerships\n(PPPs) and catalyzing private investment in clean energy and new technology.6  \n10. The ensuing projects to be prepared under the TA facility are of similar nature. These\nprojects are aligned with the objectives of the Pacific DMCs to strengthen the reliability and\nsustainability of the energy sector and mobilize private sector investments (footnote 4). The\nprojects aim to improve the quality of energy supply, reduce aggregate technical and commercial\nlosses, and improve the financial performance of energy utilities. All proposed projects will be\nsupported by ADB\u2019s ongoing and scheduled regional technical assistance programs.7\nB. Outputs and Activities\n11. Output 1: Viability assessments on ensuing projects prepared. The TA facility will\nprovide technical expertise to prioritize, plan, and prepare investment projects for the proposed\n(i) Federated States of Micronesia Climate Resilient Energy and Water Project, (ii) Republic of\nthe  Marshall  Islands  Electrification  Project,  and  (iii)  Solomon  Islands  Sustainable  Solar\nDevelopment Investment Program. Due diligence will include viability assessments of all key\naspects  of  the  proposed  projects.  Detailed  activities  will  include,  as  required:  (i)  technical\nfeasibility studies; (ii) economic and financial analyses; (iii)  financial management assessments;\n(iv) procurement assessments, plans and preparation of bidding documents; (v) gender analysis,\ncollection of baseline data and gender action plans; (vi) risk assessments and management plans;\n(vii) environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples safeguards assessments and\nsupport for initial implementation of required safeguards plans; (viii) integrity due diligence;\n(ix) initial poverty and social analysis; (x) climate adaptation and disaster risk management\nmeasures, climate risk and adaptation assessment, and disaster risk assessment; (xi) sector\nassessment; and (xii) project implementation consultant recruitment.\n12. Output 2: Capacity building intervention and energy sector reforms strengthened.\nThis will include identifying potential technical capacity building, financial management, reporting,\ndisclosure, and corporate governance issues and defining the scope of capacity building to meet\nADB\u2019s requirements on sustainability. This activity will be completed by ongoing and planned ADB\nregional  assistance  to  power  utilities  and  regulators  to  ensure  sustainable  implementation \ncapacity for future operations is built.8 In addition, plans to mobilize and manage PPPs in energy \ninfrastructure will be developed, including support to the Pacific DMCs for identifying, designing, \nmanaging, tendering, and negotiating private sector participation in the energy projects. Under \n6  The ensuing projects will also consider a broad spectrum of opportunities for private investment: (i) hydrogen and \nthermal storage for seasonal time-shifting; and (ii) energy end-use as storage, e.g., electric vehicle charging. \n8  ADB. 2017.
