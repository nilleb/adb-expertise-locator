I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of $50,000,000 to TBC Bank (TBC) for Promoting Financial Sector Growth and \nService Diversity in Georgia.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description  \n2.  After the recession that followed the financial crisis and the conflict with the Russian \nFederation in 2008, Georgia witnessed a strong rebound with real economic growth exceeding \n6% per annum in 2010 and 2011. However, the recession highlighted the adverse impact on \nincomes  and  poverty,  as  well  as  the  importance  of  robust  financial  systems  in  a  volatile \neconomic environment. Although Georgia is a lower middle-income country, poverty remains \nhigh at 25% as of 2010 and in rural areas the incidence of poverty may be as high as 60%.2 \n \n3.  Exposure  to  the  macroeconomic  shocks  and  financial  crises  undermined  public \nconfidence in Georgia\u2019s banking sector since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Private credit to \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaged  31%  (2008\u20132010),  indicating  a  depth  of financial \nintermediation far below other middle-income peers.3 Access to financial services is moderate in \nGeorgia, but highly concentrated in the capital Tbilisi, where 78% of bank lending is being \nextended. Georgia\u2019s regions,4 which account for about half the population, lag far behind the \ncapital in accessing finance, receiving only 22% of bank lending. 5 Compared with emerging \nmarkets in Eastern Europe the efficiency and stability of financial intermediation are low, as \nwitnessed by high lending\u2013deposit rate spreads and high defaults in 2008 and 2009. Supporting \noutreach of financial services to the regions and overall stability of the financial sector will have \nmajor  qualitative  impacts  on  the  economy  and  people,  by  stimulating  rural  income  and \nemployment, and supporting critical risk diversification in a volatile macroeconomic environment. \n \n4.  Although rural economic activity contributes only 17% to GDP, it supports half of the \npopulation and 65% of employment, of which farms employ 53% and nonfarm enterprises 12% \n(footnote 2). The quality of growth is particularly significant in rural areas, as it provides major \nbenefits for low-income families and stimulates demand for goods and services produced by \nmicro,  small,  and  medium  sized  enterprises  (MSMEs),6 which  represent  the  bulk  of  rural \nactivities. The government has recognized that its liberal economic policies  have  led to a \nconcentration of activity in the capital, leaving rural areas behind. Stimulating economic activity \nand income generation in the regions has become a government priority, and it is pursuing rural \ninvestments in infrastructure, agriculture, and agribusiness.7 An increase in international tourism \npoints to the potential for additional income and employment opportunities in this sector. \n \n5.  MSMEs in Georgia are a critical contributor to income and employment, with 42% of the \nlabor force being employed by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and many more \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 \n2  World Bank. 2009.

However, MSMEs and farmers have consistently \nlacked access to finance because of traditional security-based lending processes that ignore \ntheir information availability.8 The senior loan to TBC, Georgia\u2019s second largest bank in terms of \nassets (GEL3.6 billion as of 30 June 2012), aims to support inclusive financial growth and \ndeepen access to finance, by extending funding to TBC for onlending to MSMEs operating \nexclusively in rural regions outside the capital and supporting TBC as a systemically important \nbank.9 This is consistent with the effort of the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) to promote \nfinancial stability and access to finance.  \n \n6.  In April 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) entered into discussions with TBC \nsenior management and designed a loan targeted to support MSMEs in Georgia\u2019s rural regions. \nTBC is considered a good candidate for ADB funding, given its recent acquisition of Bank \nConstanta,10 and its rural staffing and branch expansion plans. This gives TBC a strong regional \nplatform to target and service MSMEs operating outside the capital. TBC also supports high \nprudential standards for Georgia\u2019s banking industry, and the implementation within TBC of \nenhanced systems of governance, capital, and risk management consistent with the introduction \nof  Basel  II  and  Basel  III  regulatory  frameworks.  TBC\u2019s  substantial  improvements  in  its \ngovernance and financial performance since 2009 have been recognized internationally, as \nevidenced through credit rating upgrades to B1 by Moody\u2019s and BB\u2013 by Fitch in June 2012. \nTBC also received Euromoney awards in 2011 and 2012 as the best bank in Georgia. \n \nB.  Business Overview and Strategy \n7.  TBC is the second largest bank in Georgia, and is systemically important with a market \nshare of 28% of loans and 32% of deposits at 30 September 2012. It has a strong franchise with \ncorporate, SME, and retail clients. Its unique strength lies in its business sophistication and \noutreach through cost-effective distribution channels. TBC plans to diversify its portfolio by \nexpanding its loan book in the regions, thereby reducing the concentration risk to large single \nand group borrowers. The acquisition of Bank Constanta has helped TBC to obtain a stronger \nrural footprint through Bank Constanta\u2019s extensive regional branch network of 44 branches, \nincreasing  TBC\u2019s  branches  to  101  as  of  mid-November  2012.  Moreover,  TBC  plans  to \nstrengthen services to MSMEs through dedicated regional branch units, and product cross-\nselling to small and rural enterprises through Bank Constanta and TBC channels. \n \n8.  In October 2012, TBC revised its business targets based on the anticipated slowing of \nthe Georgian economy and that of its trading partners, reflecting a more moderate growth \ntrajectory. TBC expects its annual business growth to remain above market growth. Given its \nnew  focus  on  expanding  outside Tbilisi,  TBC projects  its  regional GLP  to grow  above  its \naverage growth. \n \n9.  TBC\u2019s diversification is closely associated with its efforts to establish an internal capital \nadequacy  assessment  process  (ICAAP)11 to  enhance  its  solvency  management  and  risk \nmanagement through enhanced stress testing and forecasting capabilities in accordance with \n                                                \n8  The depth of financial services offered in rural areas is very low. Because of the informal nature of their business \nand the lack or limitation of financial documentation and property titles, limited fixed assets, and high reliance on \ncash flow revenues, potential borrowers do not meet standard requirements for obtaining bank credit. Banks need \nto adapt their lending processes and build their expertise in cash flow-based lending. \n9  Diversification of sources of growth is essential for Georgia. In 2010, for instance, 73% of Georgia\u2019s registered \nenterprises\u2019 business turnover was concentrated in the capital region. \n10 In April 2011, TBC acquired 83% ownership in Bank Constanta, the largest microfinance institution in Georgia. \n11 ICAAP describes a bank\u2019s internal management processes required under Pillar 2 of the Basel II regulatory \nframework.  \n ", "        3 \nBasel II requirements becoming effective in 2013. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n10.  Ownership. TBC was established in 1992 by Georgian entrepreneurs, M. Khazaradze \nand B. Japaridze, which own 27.74% of shares. Since 2001, international financial institutions \n(IFIs) have significant shareholdings. In November 2012 IFIs hold 54.15% of issued shares: the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (19.80%),  the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (19.80%), German development cooperation through DEG (11.32%), and the \nDevelopment Finance Company of the Netherlands (FMO) (3.23%). Other shareholders are \nJP Morgan (5.34%), Ashmore (4.52%), TBC management, and individuals who hold 8.25% of \nthe shares. \n \n11.  Management.  The  management  board  is  composed  of  seven  senior  executives \nincluding the chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief risk \nofficer, and three business heads. All have professional backgrounds and most have been with \nTBC for more than 10 years. The chief financial officer and the head of corporate finance have \ninternational banking experience. With three of the seven management board members, women \nare well represented. The management board sets TBC\u2019s strategic targets, and prepares risk \nlimits  and  credit  policies  for  approval  by  the  supervisory  board.  The  management  board \nmembers are experienced bankers who are well qualified to lead TBC. \n \n12.  Governance.  TBC  is  governed  by  a  two-tier  board  structure  consisting  of  the \nsupervisory  board  and  the  management  board.  The  supervisory  board  is  responsible  for \noverseeing the implementation of key policies, approving strategic and business targets, and \nappointing management and monitoring their performance. IFI shareholders nominate four of \nthe  seven  supervisory  board  members,  who  are  currently  all  senior  professionals  with \ninternational banking experience. The other three supervisory board members, including the \nchairperson,  are  well-known  Georgian  entrepreneurs.  There  are  currently  no  independent \ndirectors, and the incumbent chairperson, M. Khazaradze, has held the position for 20 years. \n \n13.  In anticipation of the introduction of Basel II, TBC is preparing to establish a new credit \nrisk committee under the supervisory board in 2013. The shareholders have also determined \nthat the supervisory board will be supported by (i) a new remuneration committee responsible \nfor management board remuneration policies, (ii) a new nomination committee responsible for \nmanagement board appointments, and (iii) an enhanced audit committee that will cover ethics \nand control within TBC. TBC\u2019s governance draws strength from its IFI shareholders. \n \n14.  The audit committee directly reports to the supervisory board and is composed of its full-\ntime chairperson and two members, one of which is an IFI-appointed supervisory board member. \nTBC\u2019s Audit Department is staffed by experienced auditors and reports to the audit committee. \nUsual  observations  identify  and  help  address  (i)  fraud,  (ii)  system  deficiencies,  and  (iii) \ncompliance issues. Audit observations have not identified any major accounting, operational, \nand compliance risks. External audit assignments are carried out by large international firms, \nwith TBC currently using PricewaterhouseCoopers. TBC\u2019s anti-money-laundering unit has 10 \nstaff  checking  transactions  above  GEL30,000.  The  anti-money-laundering  unit  identifies \nsuspicious  transactions  by  scanning  information  by  source  of  wealth,  politically  exposed \npersons, and watch lists. It reports to the NBG Financial Investigation Unit.12 \n \n                                                \n12 Georgia participates in the Financial Action Task Force. Its compliance is monitored by MONEYVAL, the Council of \nEurope Committee of Experts on the Evaluation of Anti-Money Laundering Measures and the Financing of \nTerrorism. \n ", "4   \nD.  Financial Performance CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nE.  Unique Features \n15.  The proposed objectives of the loan will be supported by technical assistance (TA) \nresources. First, resources will be made available to TBC under ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for Capacity \nBuilding for Financial Institutions, Phase 2 to improve TBC\u2019s risk management and lending \npractices, including its business expansion to rural regions within Georgia. 13 Second, ADB \nhas\u2014as  an  integral  part  of  its  support\u2014approved  TA  for  NBG  to  support  the  review, \nimprovement, and supervision of ICAAPs across Georgia\u2019s banking system, which is set to \ncommence  in  early  2013.14 This  is  in  line  with  NBG\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  financial  sector \nresilience. Providing lender-of-last-resort facilities, and improving asset liability management, \nincluding stress testing, are important focus areas to ensure adequate solvency and liquidity of \nbanks.  ADB  has  been  supporting  NBG  since  2009  to  (i)  help  restructure  its  supervision \ndepartment,  by  integrating  on-  and  off-site  supervision  through  a  group  approach  and \nestablishing  a  systemic  risk  team;  (ii)  introduce  a  risk-based  approach  to  regulation  and \nsupervision of financial institutions and incorporate macro-prudential and systemic risks; and (iii) \nstrengthen its risk assessment capabilities. In 2011, NBG established a new capital adequacy \nregulation that complies with the Basel II and Basel III frameworks and requires banks\u2019 gradual \nICAAP implementation in 2013, forming the cornerstone for customized bank risk assessments \nand related capital requirements. While most of the banks are on track to comply with the new \nBasel II requirements, implementing the ICAAP under pillar 2 for the first time is challenging for \nbanks and supervisors. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  The proposed ADB assistance consists of a senior loan facility of up to $50 million with a \ntenor of 5 years. The proceeds will be used to diversify TBC\u2019s high exposure to Tbilisi by \n(i) increasing lending to enterprises exclusively in the underserved rural regions; (ii) providing \nenhanced access to longer-term finance for the MSME segment,15 which is critical to support \nincome and employment; and (iii) gradually funding smaller entities, thereby providing greater \ndiversification of TBC\u2019s loan book, and reducing TBC\u2019s exposure to its large borrowers and \ngroups. The senior loan will be available to TBC for onlending to MSMEs sourced through \nTBC\u2019s retail, SMEs, and corporate platforms, as well as Bank Constanta\u2019s microfinance lending \nplatform.  The  proceeds  of  the  ADB  financing  will  be  exclusively  targeted  to  businesses \noperating in regions outside Tbilisi.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  TBC will be required to provide annual audited financial statements in accordance with \ninternational financial reporting standards. TBC will also provide quarterly financial statements \nand compliance certificates for agreed covenants. Reporting requirements also include (i) status \nupdates  for  introducing  and  maintaining  the  Basel  regulatory  framework;  (ii)  updates  on \ngovernance, safeguards, and social protection compliance; and (iii) updates on TBC\u2019s business \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2010.

ADB will field review missions semiannually to \nreview and discuss progress with TBC management. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n18.  ADB will provide stable long-term financing which currently cannot be raised from the \nlocal market. Georgia\u2019s capital markets are nascent, and public confidence in the financial \nsector is only gradually being restored. Commercial bank funding is also not readily available \ngiven current market conditions in Europe. Finally, IFIs that are funding Georgian banks are now \noperating within tight country and sector exposure limits\u2014increasing the importance of ADB\u2019s \nengagement. ADB will provide term financing and assist to build public confidence in the banks. \n \n19.  Through close on-site monitoring and dialogue with TBC management, ADB will support \nTBC\u2019s  adherence  to  high  corporate  governance  and  social,  environmental,  and  fiduciary \nstandards, while enhancing standards for risk management. \n \n20.  ADB has been responsive to the needs of TBC. Additional TA will be available for TBC \nunder ADB\u2019s ongoing TA for Capacity Building for Financial Institutions, Phase 2 (footnote 21). \nThrough the semiannual consultation process between TBC and ADB, areas for deployment of \nTA can be identified, and may include further assistance to improve risk management in line \nwith Basel II and III, and enhance TBC\u2019s origination and monitoring standards for MSME clients \nusing enhanced cash flow analysis. \n \nD.  Risks  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n21.  Impact. The impacts of the investment are (i) improved access to financial services for \nMSMEs, and (ii) enhanced resilience of Georgia\u2019s banking system. More prudent financial \nintermediation  by  banks  is  expected  to  lead to greater  consumer  confidence. This  will  be \nreflected by an increase in bank deposits and loans, as well as an increase in the private credit \nto GDP ratio. \n \n22.  Outcome. The outcome of the investment is that TBC remains profitable and becomes a \nmore  resilient  bank,  prudently  serving  the  diverse  needs  of  Georgia\u2019s  economy.  TBC  is \nexpected to set an example for other banks in the industry and position itself to be able to \nwithstand  possible  future  financial  stress  by  putting  in  place  advanced  approaches  for \nmaintaining capital adequacy, improving its risk management capability to exceed minimum \nrequirements of Basel II, and improving efficiencies. \n \n23.  Outputs. The output of the investment is that TBC will improve its service outreach to \nMSMEs, especially in the regions, and diversify its credit risk exposure by (i) reducing borrower, \nsector, and regional concentration; and (ii) ensuring adequate investment is made in human \nresources, processes, and systems. \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n24.  Under Strategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the financial sector by \nsupporting the development of financial infrastructure, institutions, and products and services, \n ", "6   \nand by promoting inclusive growth.16 This loan will help TBC to reach down the market to \nMSMEs in rural regions and is consistent with the Government of Georgia\u2019s efforts to invest in \nthe rural regions, particularly in the areas of infrastructure, agriculture, and agribusiness after \nyears of neglect that led to a concentration of activities in the capital. Strategy 2020\u2019s target on \npoverty  reduction  through  private  sector  development  will  be  supported  via  TBC\u2019s  new \nemphasis on activities outside the capital, where poverty is highest. \n25.  ADB\u2019s  interim  operational  strategy,  2008\u20132009  for  Georgia  identified  financial \nintermediation as a priority for private sector development, noting that sustaining growth will \nrequire broadening access to finance. 17 It highlights that agriculture and SMEs have inadequate \naccess to financial services, and that lending support via financial institutions presents the \ngreatest  opportunity  for  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations.  The  recent  crisis  highlighted  the \nimportance of resilient banking systems to protect against adverse impacts on its population. \n2.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n26.  Financial sector development is a key focus of ADB assistance as set out in ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Development Strategy18 and Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy,19 which note \neconomic growth, stimulated by private sector investment, as a key factor in reducing poverty. \nThese strategies also note the importance of generating jobs, with private sector employment \nbeing  the  major  source  of  income  for  workers  and  their  families.  The  Private  Sector \nDevelopment  Strategy  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  role  in  strengthening  the  financial  sectors  in  its \ndeveloping member countries. It provides that SME beneficiaries of financial intermediation are \nimportant employers and providers of income to contribute to poverty reduction. Support of \nfinancial intermediaries is also important to instill confidence and restore the financial sector in \ncrisis-hit countries. The loan is consistent with ADB\u2019s financial sector operational plan and the \n2007 report of the Working Group on Rural Poverty,20 which underscores the importance of rural \nfinance, and promotes financial inclusion of underserved poor households, farmers, and SMEs. \n \n27.  ADB has approved three nonsovereign loans to banks in Georgia, all of which targeted \nSMEs.21 The first loan to BOG was made immediately after Georgia joined ADB. Although \nBOG\u2019s performance was adversely affected by the 2008 crisis, it has made an impressive \nrecovery since 2010 and ADB\u2019s loan has been repaid. ADB provided a second loan to BOG as \na response to the 2008 crisis, which was critical in stabilizing BOG\u2019s access to funding and \nmaintaining its outreach to SMEs. While higher deposit mobilization and international capital \nmarket resources would be desirable, public confidence in banks is only gradually improving \nfrom low levels, and international investors remain risk averse given global economic conditions. \nAs a result, IFI funding to solvent Georgian banks remains essential for Georgia\u2019s transition to \nan inclusive financial system. Building on the previous interventions, the loan to TBC would take \nADB\u2019s financing downstream to MSMEs operating in the underserved rural regions. \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2008.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, the senior loan is classified \ncategory FI based on potential impacts on the environment, and category FI treated as C for \nimpacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Subloans  under  environment \ncategory A, and social safeguards categories A and B will not be financed under the senior loan. \nThe subloans\u2019 potential environment and social impacts, its risks associated with TBC\u2019s existing \nand likely future portfolio, and TBC\u2019s commitment and capacity for environmental and social \nmanagement, have been assessed. The existing environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) established by TBC and the agreed modifications with ADB are deemed adequate to \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. TBC will ensure that investments using ADB \nfunds do not involve business activities on ADB\u2019s prohibited investment activities list. TBC will \nenhance its existing ESMS to implement the modifications agreed with ADB before the first \ndisbursement for subloan financing. The ESMS will include provisions requiring TBC to comply \nwith  national  labor  laws  and  to  take  specific  measures  in  relation  to  the  internationally \nrecognized core labor standards, in compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection strategy.22 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n29.  TBC was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n30.  The proposed senior loan is within the medium-term country, industry, group, and single \ninvestment exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n31.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank 23  the \nGovernment of Georgia\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance to TBC will be obtained. ADB \nwill enter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, \nfollowing approval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed senior loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the senior loan \nof $50,000,000 to TBC Bank for Promoting Financial Sector Growth and Service Diversity in \nGeorgia,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  such  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n 20 December 2012 \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2001.
