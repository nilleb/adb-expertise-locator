An  initial  environmental  examination  has  been \nAssessment  conducted and is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n   \nProject Description  The Nurek 500 kV Switchyard Reconstruction Project (the Project) \nwill build a new Nurek 500 kV switchyard on a new site within the \nNurek Hydroelectric Power Plant (HEPP) complex to replace the \nexisting Nurek 500 kilovolt (kV) switchyard. The existing 500 kV \nequipment will be dismantled and will mostly be used as spare \nparts for other 500 kV substations.  \n   \nRationale  Nurek  HEPP,  incorporating  220  kV  and  500  kV  switchyards, \nproduces  over  70%  of  Tajikistan's  electricity  and  performs  a \nfrequency  regulation  role  for  the  Central  Asian  power  system, \nwhich  includes  the  electricity  systems  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.  \n \nThe existing switchyards were built more than 30 years ago with \nSoviet technology and replacement parts are no longer available. \nThey are therefore in need of complete replacement.   \n \nSevere  subsidence  in  areas  of  the  switchyards  has  been \noccurring  for  many  years,  requiring  major  ongoing  remedial \nmeasures. This is due to an extensive salt dome in the vicinity of \nthe  switchyards  that  destabilizes  the  ground  conditions  during \nsnow melt and rain. There are risks for both switchyards that a \ncatastrophic  event  may  occur  at  any  time,  thereby  destroying \nmajor parts of the switchgear. Ground stabilization measures are \nconsidered impractical.   \n \nThe  Government  of  Tajikistan  (the  Government)  considers  the \nreconstruction of the switchyards to be emergency projects due to \nthe  deteriorating  equipment  and  unstable  geological  site \nconditions that could result in the potential loss of major output \nfrom the Nurek HEPP for lengthy periods. \n \nA 2006 feasibility study recommended that the equipment in both \nswitchyards be retired, with new switchyards to be built on secure \nground. The study recommended that the least-cost option was to \n ", "ii     \n \n \n  utilize a portion of the land where the existing 220 kV switchyard \nis  currently  located  for  both  new  switchyards.  The  ground \nconditions  of  the  proposed  new  site  have  been  verified  as \nsatisfactory by geological investigation. \n \nGas-insulated switchgear technology, which uses approximately \n10% of the area required by conventional air-insulated switchgear \ntechnology, is required due to the restricted area of the proposed \nnew site. \n \nThe  Government  signed  a  loan  agreement  with  the  German \nDevelopment Cooperation through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau \n(Credit  Institute  for  Reconstruction)  in  August  2008  for  the \nfinancing of the new 220 kV gas-insulated switchgear switchyard, \nwith a projected completion date of April 2011. The Project under \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  will  complete  the \nrequired rehabilitation of the switchyards. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The impact is sustainable and reliable electricity supply to support \neconomic development. It will mitigate the risk of natural disasters \ndisabling the switchyard, and will stabilize the flow of electricity \ncoming from the strategically important Nurek HEPP.  \n \nThe outcome is the reliable evacuation of Nurek HEPP electricity \nto the grid.    \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $66.90 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $9.4 million. \n \nTable 1: Tentative Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nEstimated \nItem    Amount\n     \nA.

Quality- and cost-based \nselection method with weighting of 90:10 will be adopted, since \nthe consequences of poor performance could be high, leading to \ncatastrophic economic, financial, and social losses. \n   \n ", "iv     \n \n \nProject Benefits and  The  primary  beneficiaries  of  the  Project  will  be  business \nBeneficiaries  enterprises  and  the  population  who  will  benefit  from  a  stable \nsupply  of  electricity  services  and  long-term  cost  reductions \nresulting  from  economic  dispatch  of  electricity  from  the  Nurek \nHEPP  and  the  overall  efficiencies  gained  from  enhanced \ntransmission through the new switchyards. The financial internal \nrate of return of the Project is estimated at 9.3% and the economic \ninternal rate of return is estimated at 36.7%.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  is  technically  complicated  given  its  advanced \ntechnology content and the need for the two new switchyards to \nbe integrated both with each other and with the existing power \nstation. However, the overall technical risk is deemed to be low.   \n \nRehabilitation of the nine turbine and generators of Nurek HEPP \nis not included in the Project but will need to be carried out in the \nmedium term. It is assumed that total failure of Nurek HEPP will \nnot occur as the nine units operate independently of each other \nand any one unit can be repaired and rehabilitated at the time of \nfailure, as has been recent practice.    \n \nAt  a  policy  level,  it  is  assumed  that  the  Government  (i)  will \nimplement full cost-recovery tariffs, and (ii) is committed to making \navailable the necessary investments to rehabilitate and develop \nthe electricity sector. \n \nAt  an  institutional  level,  it  is  assumed  that  Barki  Tajik  will  (i) \nimplement  needed  reforms  with  the  modernization  of  its \nmanagement,  governance,  and  corporate  procedures;  and  (ii) \ndeliver  on  its  assurances  to  improve  collection  levels  and \nadequately fund operation and maintenance. \n \n \n  ", " \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Tajikistan for the Nurek 500 kV Switchyard Reconstruction Project (the \nProject). The design and monitoring framework of the Project is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Tajikistan possesses vast amounts of hydroelectric (40 gigawatts [GW]) and coal (3,600 \nmillion tons) energy resources, of which only a small fraction (less than 10% of the hydroelectric \nand negligible coal) has been developed. The power sector alone represents up to 5% of gross \ndomestic product and is a critical input for the main exports of cotton and aluminum. Meanwhile, \nthe country faces energy deficits and cannot meet its winter demand, with the deficits in the \nwinter of 2007/2008 being particularly severe. \n3.  Tajikistan has an installed generation capacity of 4,326 megawatts (MW), of which 98% \nis hydroelectric power-based. The predominance of hydroelectric energy creates a problem as \nhydropower production exceeds demand in summer and is reduced in winter when glacial melt \nis least and demand is most. As a result, Tajikistan imports electricity and fossil fuels in winter to \nmeet energy needs, and has excess water during summer.   \n4.  Per capita domestic energy consumption, at about 0.5 ton of oil equivalent, is very high \ngiven  the  country's  level  of  economic  development.  This  is  because  of  the  low  end-use \nefficiency and high heating requirements during winter. With the rise in prices of imported fuel, \nhouseholds have switched from organic fuels to electricity for heating and cooking, reflecting the \nfact that electricity is the only form of reliable energy available and the Government\u2019s below-cost \npricing policies have encouraged a shift to electricity away from other forms of energy. \n5.  Until recently, average electricity tariffs were considerably below cost-recovery levels, \nwith the average tariff in 2006 of $0.006 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Since 2007, Tajikistan has \nimplemented three tariff increases and is on schedule to bring the average tariff to a financially \nviable level of $0.025/kWh (in 2008 terms) by 2010. In the gas sector, the current tariffs have \nbeen increased so that they are closer to the financial viability levels. Coal prices are market \nbased. \n6.  Electricity consumption in 2005 was 15 million gigawatt-hours (GWh), with the main user \ngroups being industry (51%), agriculture (15%), and households (28.2%), and with Tajikistan \nAluminum Company (TALCO) accounting for approximately 44.3% of total industrial use. The \nhigh percentage usage by industry and agriculture reflects the subsidized nature of the tariffs to \nthese groups.   \n \n7.  Investments in the power sector since the break-up of the former Soviet Union have \nbeen limited to emergency rehabilitation measures, a new 500 kilovolt (kV) transmission line, a \nmetering  project,  and  completion  of  the  Sangtuda  I  Hydroelectric  Power  Plant  (HEPP). \nMeanwhile, physical infrastructure continues to deteriorate, leading to high network losses and \nreduced reliability. In addition, commercial losses are high, partly due to the legacy of supplying \nenergy without meters and partly due to the lack of commercial orientation within the utilities.  \n8.  Barki Tajik Joint Stock Holding Company, a joint stock company 100% owned by the \nstate, is a vertically integrated utility, consisting of a network of 10 subsidiary power generation \n ", "2   \n \ncompanies, 17 subsidiary distribution companies, and 4 supporting companies (such enterprise \nas Energosnab and Repair-Mechanical Plant). It serves a customer base of approximately 1 \nmillion people and employed 11,200 staff in 2007.  \n \n9.  Tajikistan has not appointed an independent energy regulator. Instead, the Ministry of \nEconomic Development and Trade regulates the prices of electricity, natural gas, and district \nheat,  while  the  Fuel  and  Energy  Department  in  the  Office  of  the  President  has  overall \nresponsibility for the energy sector. This arrangement is not in line with industry best practice, \nwith the Government holding both tariff setting and ownership functions. A sector and subsector \nanalysis is in Appendix 2.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Power Sector Issues  \n10.  Winter supply deficit continues to be a problem, despite import of electricity from the \nKyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Barki Tajik is implementing improved rationing \nprocedures  whereby  load  shedding  commences  earlier  in  the  season,  with  the  result  of \nimproved  supply  during  the  coldest  winter  months.  However,  solution  of  the  winter  deficit \nproblem will require new HEPPs with seasonal water storage capacity and/or additional thermal \ngeneration capacity.   \n \n11.  Electricity infrastructure is in poor technical condition. The infrastructure needs to be \nexpanded to cater for increased demand and outdated equipment needs to be replaced. The \nProject will address part of this need with the reconstruction of one of the most outdated and \ncritical components of the system. \n \n12.  The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, and Barki Tajik, have agreed on an \napproach to tariff rationalization and increase. Tariff categories have been reduced to six (albeit \nwith further subgroups) and favorable tariffs for low-usage customers and special summer and \nwinter tariffs for TALCO have been eliminated. The weighed average tariff is forecast to be \n$0.025/kWh (in 2008 terms) in 2010, a three times increase of the average tariff from 2006. \nFollowing the most recent increase in July 2008, the weighted average tariff is $0.0017/kWh. \nNevertheless, further tariff rationalization and increases are required in order to eliminate cross \nsubsidies and fully cover Barki Tajik costs.   \n \n13.  The Ministry of Energy and Industry is responsible for coordinating the Government's \nenergy  policy.  The  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  and  Trade  regulates  the  prices  of \nelectricity, natural gas, and district heat. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is responsible \nfor environmental regulation of energy operations. The Committee on State Property exercises \nownership functions over state-owned assets. The practice of the Government holding both tariff \nsetting and ownership functions is not in line with industry best practice. This institutional \nframework does not reflect the needs of a market-oriented economy. \n \n14.  The state-owned Barki Tajik is in need of major restructuring. Its organizational structure \ndoes not reflect modern utility practice, while the company itself is in poor financial condition \nfollowing years of below-cost tariffs, high losses, and poor collection rates. Barki Tajik needs to \nbe reorganized to reflect the commercial nature of its business.   \n \n  ", "3 \n \n15.  Despite  having  abundant  electricity  generation  potential,  including  some  partly \ncompleted  hydropower  resources  and  power  deficit  markets  in  neighboring  countries,  the \ncountry is not optimally exploiting its export potential. \n \n2.  Government Strategy \n16.  In 2005, the Government developed a strategy based on a two-track approach for the \ndomestic and export markets, as follows:  \n \n(i)  The first track focuses on meeting the demand of the domestic market, and \ncomprises a set of policy and investment measures aimed to bring the sector to \nreasonable operating conditions and improve its financial viability. The policy \nmeasures include (a) the implementation of a medium-term tariff policy; (b) a \nsocial protection policy for energy services to improve the effectiveness of the \nscheme and ensure a more targeted approach to support the poor; and (c) an \ninstitutional reform policy for the energy sector to improve the transparency and \nefficiency of operations, enable electricity trade, and pave the way for private \nsector  participation  in  the  sector.  The  investment  measures  include \nimplementation of programs for (a) increased energy efficiency; (b) demand-side \nmanagement, including a heat supply strategy; and (c) increasing energy supply \nto meet winter demand, with focus on rehabilitation of existing assets.  \n \n(ii)  The second track focuses on increasing electricity exports by (a) using existing \nseasonal surpluses in the summer, and (b) attracting private sector investors to \njoin  in  developing  newer  hydroelectric  and  thermal  capacities  for  exports  to \nneighboring and regional countries.   \n \n3.  Asian Development Bank Strategy \n17.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) strategy for the energy sector in Tajikistan is to \nensure that domestic energy demands are met from a sustainable and viable industry and to \nassist in the development of country\u2019s considerable hydropower export potential. This strategy is \nto  be  achieved  through  (i)  improvements  in  the  sector\u2019s  institutional  structure,  operational \nefficiency, and financial performance; and (ii) support in the development of regional energy \ntrade  projects.  This  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Long-term  Strategic  Framework  2008\u20132020 \n(Strategy 2020)1 where support of infrastructure development and regional cooperation are core \nareas.  The Project is not included in the current country partnership strategy for Tajikistan but \nhas been added in ADB\u2019s 2008 country assistance program following the Government\u2019s request \non 16 July 2008. \n \n4.  Project Rationale \n18.  Nurek HEPP produces over 70% of Tajikistan's electricity and performs a frequency \nregulation role for the Central Asian power system.2 Reliable operation of Nurek HEPP is critical \nto meet Tajikistan electric supply requirements and is an important aspect of Central Asian \nPower System operation.   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  Central  Asian  power  system  includes  the  networks  of  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Turkmenistan,  and \nUzbekistan. \n ", "4   \n \n19.  The existing switchyards use obsolete Soviet technology for which replacement parts \nare no longer available. The equipment in both switchyards has exceeded its useful life and is in \nneed of complete replacement. In the absence of equipment replacement, the availability of \nboth switchyards will deteriorate in the coming years, thereby curtailing Nurek HEPP output.   \n \n20.  Nurek HEPP, situated 75 kilometers east of Dushanbe, the capital of Tajikistan, was \ncommissioned in 1972 and produces 11,200 GWh within an average hydrological year. Nurek \nhas nine generator and turbine units with total installed capacity of 3,000 MW. Six generator and \nturbine units are connected to the Nurek 500 kV switchyard and three to the Nurek 220 kV \nswitchyard. Both switchyards currently use air-insulated switchgear (AIS) and are in separate \nlocations within the Nurek HEPP complex.  \n \n21.  Severe subsidence in areas of the 500 kV and 220 kV switchyards has been occurring \nfor many years, requiring major ongoing remedial measures. This is due to an extensive salt \ndome in the vicinity of the switchyards that destabilizes the ground conditions during times of \nsnow melt and rain. There are risks for both switchyards that a catastrophic event may occur at \nany time, thereby destroying major parts of the switchgear. Ground stabilization measures are \nconsidered impractical. There are also regular landslides in the immediate vicinity of the 500 kV \nsite, making the location yet more unattractive for an electrical installation.   \n \n22.  The Government considers the reconstruction of the 220 kV and 500 kV switchyards to \nbe emergency projects due to the deteriorating equipment, unstable geological site conditions, \nand the potential for loss of major portions of Nurek HEPP output for lengthy periods. \n \n23.  A  2006  feasibility  study  conducted  by  consulting  engineers  Fichtner  of  Germany \nrecommended that the equipment in both switchyards be retired with new switchyards to be built \non secure ground. The study examined various alternative sites for the new switchyards. Such \nalternatives were limited due to the mountainous location and the salt dome footprint. The study \nconcluded that the least-cost option was to utilize a portion of the existing 220 kV switchyard for \nboth new switchyards, with the ground conditions of the proposed new site having been verified \nas satisfactory by geological investigation. Gas-insulated switchgear (GIS) technology, which \nuses  approximately  10%  of  the  area  required  by  AIS  technology,  is  required  due  to  the \nrestricted area of the proposed new site. \n \n24.  The Government signed a loan agreement with the German Development Cooperation \nthrough Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (Credit Institute for Reconstruction) in August 2008 for \nthe financing of the new 220 kV GIS switchyard with a projected completion date of April 2011. \nThe Project under ADB financing will complete the required rehabilitation of the switchyards. \n \n5.  External Assistance \n25.  The first track of the Government\u2019s strategy\u2014to focus on the domestic market\u2014is being \nsupported by the multilateral and bilateral donor community through a range of rehabilitation \nprojects (Appendix 3). The proposed Nurek 500 kV Switchyard Reconstruction Project, which \nwill enable continued electricity supply to Tajikistan, is consistent with this strategy. On 16 July \n2008, the Government requested ADB\u2019s financial assistance to implement the Project.   \n  ", "5 \n \n26.  ADB-funded technical assistance (TA) 3 is assisting the Ministry of Energy and Industry \nin preparing options for the restructuring of Barki Tajik, and in implementing the options, with TA \ncompletion due in 2010. A United States Trade and Development Agency-funded study, due to \ncommence at the end of 2008, will examine the viability of commercial coal mine developments, \nfor which a thermal power plant would be a potential customer. Sangtuda1 HEPP (670 MW \ncapacity),  70%  owned  by  RAO  UES  of  Russia  and  30%  by  the  Government,  is  under \nconstruction, with full capacity operation scheduled for 2009.   \n27.  Following the Shanghai Cooperation Organization Meeting in Tajikistan in August 2008, \nthe  governments  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  the  Russian  Federation  signed \nagreements with the Government of Tajikistan to finance four new HEPPs, three of which will be \nfinanced by the Russian Federation (the largest with a capacity of 250 MW) and one by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (with a 200 MW capacity).   \n28.  Tajikistan continues to promote the development of Rogun HEPP (3,600 MW capacity), \nconstruction of which started during the Soviet era but has since been suspended. A World \nBank-funded feasibility study is due to commence in late 2008. This major project would serve \nthe dual purposes of meeting Tajikistan's winter demand and allowing Tajikistan to export the \nconsiderable surplus energy.   \n29.  The second track of the Government\u2019s strategy\u2014to focus on the export market\u2014is being \nimplemented with (i) the signing of ADB loans4 for construction of the Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan \ntransmission interconnection, and (ii) the ongoing development of the Central Asia\u2013South Asia \nregional electricity market5 (CASAREM) project, which envisages the building of a high voltage \ntransmission interconnection to allow electricity exports from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \nto Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of which are energy deficient.   \n6.  Lessons \n30.  Delays were experienced in the implementation of early ADB projects due to project staff \nbeing  unfamiliar  with  ADB  procurement  procedures  and  inexperienced  with  international \nprojects.  However,  the  proposed  project  management  unit  (PMU)  has  learned  from  its \nexperiences and its implementation of ongoing ADB-assisted projects is satisfactory.   \n \n31.  Previous loan covenants requiring the introducing of cost-recovery tariffs have not been \nfully implemented due to resistance from poor and vulnerable customers who have difficulty in \npaying  the  existing  low  tariffs.  The  project  design  addresses  this  issue  by  requiring  the \nGovernment to use the subsidiary loan repayments to subsidize targeted customers while \nensuring that Barki Tajik raises its tariff to a full cost-recovery level.   \n \n32.  Barki Tajik is weak in nontechnical areas of governance, human resource management, \nfinancial controls, and commercial awareness. Reform is proving to be a slow process, with the \nGovernment and Barki Tajik being generally resistant to change. However, the Government has \nnow indicated its intention to proceed with the delayed restructuring of Barki Tajik.   \n                                                 \n3\n ADB. 2006.

ADB  experience  is  that  Central  Asian  countries  are  still  in  a  transition  stage,  with \ncommercial arrangements between governments often being dictated more by political than \neconomic considerations. ADB design of regional trade projects have reflected this stage of \ndevelopment  by  requiring  the  trading  parties  to  finalize  commercial  agreements  as  a \nprecondition before release of development funds.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n34.  The  impact  of  the  Project  is  sustainable  and  reliable  electricity  supply  to  support \neconomic development. It will mitigate the risk of natural disasters disabling the switchyard, and \nwill stabilize the flow of electricity coming from the strategically important Nurek HEPP. The \noutcome of the Project is the reliable evacuation of Nurek HEPP electricity to the grid.  \n  \nB.  Outputs \n35.  The Project output is the building of a new Nurek 500 kV switchyard on a new site within \nthe Nurek Hydroelectric Power Plant (HEPP) complex, which will replace the existing Nurek 500 \nkilovolt (kV) switchyard. The existing 500 kV equipment will be dismantled and will mostly be \nused as spare parts for other 500 kV substations. Old metals will be sold to local recycling \ncompanies. The new Nurek 500 kV switchyard will utilize GIS technology, which only requires \napproximately 10% of the area required by AIS technology used in the existing switchyards.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n36.  Current  Barki  Tajik  tariff  methodology  employs  rates  that  are  below  the  long-run \nmarginal cost and incorporates cross subsidies between different consumer categories. This is \ninconsistent with international best utility practice whereby tariffs should cover costs without \ncross subsidies. In the event that the Government identifies a particular consumer class that \nrequires a subsidy, this should be funded directly by the Government in a transparent manner.  \n \n37.  In accordance with the Government\u2019s strategy, Barki Tajik\u2019s tariffs are to be increased \nsuch that Barki Tajik\u2019s future income will be sufficient to cover costs, repay debt, and provide \nadequate return on equity investments. As Barki Tajik will perform as a commercial company, it \nshould therefore not in itself be the recipient of the ADB grant.  \n \n38.  ADB will provide the project funds to the Government through a grant agreement. The \nGovernment will then lend the Government\u2019s share and ADB\u2019s share of the Project funds to \nBarki Tajik through a subsidiary loan agreement acceptable to ADB. Barki Tajik repayments to \nthe Government of the principal and interest arising from this subsidiary loan agreement will be \nused exclusively to subsidize the poor and vulnerable electricity consumers in accordance with \na methodology agreed with ADB and reflected in such subsidiary loan agreement. \n \nD.  Investment Plan \n39.  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $66.9 million (Table 1). A detailed \nproject investment plan by cost category is in Appendix 4. \n \n \n  ", "7 \n \nTable 1: Tentative Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Estimated Amount\nA.

The Government has requested a grant of $54.77 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources to help finance the Project. The Government and Barki Tajik will provide counterpart \nfunding of $12.1 million for taxes and duties, which may take the form of exemption, and also for \nproject support and interest.  \n \nTable 2: Tentative Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Amount  Share (%) \nAsian Development Bank   54.77  81.9 \nGovernment and Barki Tajik  12.13  18.1 \n  Total  66.90  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n41.  ADB\u2019s Policy on Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants6 was \napproved by the Board on 26 September 2007. The paper provided that, for countries eligible \nfor grant assistance, the percentage of ADB financing on a grant basis in the country will be \nbased on such country\u2019s debt distress classification. Tajikistan is classified as a country with \nhigh risk of debt distress and therefore is eligible to receive its Asian Development Fund \nallocation on a 100% grant basis. \n \n42.  It has been agreed with the Government that it will lend the ADB grant proceeds to Barki \nTajik at an interest rate of 5% per annum at a tenor of 25 years including a 5-year grace period \nand with the foreign exchange risk bourne by Barki Tajik. Interest and repayment proceeds from \nBarki Tajik to the Government will be used to subsidize tariffs for the poor.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n43.  Barki Tajik shall be the Executing Agency (EA). As approved by the resolution number \n283 dated July 2006, the Government has created a state body to act as an independent PMU \nto coordinate and implement power projects that are funded through loans and grants from \nbilateral donors and international financing institutions. Barki Tajik shall employ the services of \nthe  PMU  for  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project.  The  PMU  has  been  performing \nsatisfactorily in the implementation of ongoing ADB-assisted projects. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2007. Revising the Framework for Asian Development Fund Grants. Manila. \n ", "8   \n \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n44.  The Project will be implemented over a 5-year period commencing in February 2009, of \nwhich  the  turnkey  contract  duration  will  be  approximately  3  years,  including  the  1-year \nguarantee period between the taking over and the completion of the warranty period. The \nimplementation  consultant  will  prepare  a  detailed  implementation  schedule  during  the  pre-\nconstruction  phase  of  the  Project  and  submit  it  to  the  EA  and  ADB.  The  implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Advance Contracting \n45.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  Management  has,  in  principle,  approved \nadvance  contracting  for  eligible  consulting  services.  Advance  contracting  allows  the \nGovernment to commence procurement activities, at its own risk, prior to signing of the grant \nagreement, but does not allow for the award of contract until after the grant has become \neffective. The Government was informed that such advance contracting (including advertising) \nmust comply with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The Government \nand Barki Tajik have been informed that approval of advance contracting does not commit ADB \nto finance the Project. \n   \n4.  Procurement \n46.  One  turnkey  contract  for  the  entire  Project  will  be  procured  by  Barki  Tajik  using \ninternational  competitive  bidding  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  An \nindicative procurement plan is presented in Appendix 6. The procurement plan will be updated \nat least annually, covering the next 18 months of procurement activity. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n47.  One consulting firm will be recruited as the implementation consultant. The consultant \nwill be selected and engaged by Barki Tajik in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Modified quality- and cost-based selection method with weighting of 90:10 will be \nadopted, since the consequences of poor performance could be high, leading to catastrophic \neconomic,  financial,  and  social  losses.  A  total  of  85  person-months  of  inputs,  mostly  by \ninternational consultants, will be required over the consulting service duration of approximately 3 \nyears. The provisions of consulting services are summarized in the indicative procurement plan \nin Appendix 6. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 11. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy \n48.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government and Barki Tajik. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit  and  examine  the  records  and  accounts  of  Barki  Tajik  and  all  contractors,  suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project.  \n  ", "9 \n \n \n49.  Barki Tajik will establish a website that will present information on all externally funded \nprojects.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n50.  Grant funds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time), using direct payment procedures for the turnkey contract \nand consulting services. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n51.  Barki Tajik shall maintain its financial statements in double-entry accrual accounting in \naccordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) followed in Tajikistan.7 \nIts financial statements shall comprise its balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow \nstatement  accompanied  by  their  respective  schedules  and  notes  to  accounts  as  may  be \nnecessary.  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  financial  statements  shall  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with \nInternational Standards of Auditing by an external auditor acceptable to ADB. The Barki Tajik \nannual  financial  statement  shall  be  accompanied  by  the  auditor's  letter  to  Barki  Tajik \nmanagement  and  management\u2019s  response  to  it.  Most  importantly,  Barki  Tajik\u2019s  external \nauditor's report will contain the auditor's opinion on whether ADB\u2019s grant funds were used for \nthe purposes specified in ADB\u2019s grant and project agreements. Barki Tajik will submit to ADB its \naudited annual reports in English within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \n \n52.  Barki Tajik will maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the \ngoods and services financed from the grant funds, financing resources received, expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. These project accounts and financial statements \nwill be audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards by an independent auditor \nacceptable to ADB. External auditors for the Project will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Barki Tajik will submit to ADB the audited project annual \nreports in English within 6 months of the close of every fiscal year. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n53.  The  quarterly  progress  reports  prepared  by  Barki  Tajik  will  include  (i)  a  narrative \ndescription of progress made during the period (progress on compliance with environmental and \nsocial requirements, including the environmental management plan and resettlement plan, if \nany); (ii) changes in the implementation schedule; (iii) problems or difficulties encountered; and \n(iv) work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports should also have a list of \ncritical decisions required from Government, ADB, and the Barki Tajik board in the next quarter. \nThe progress reports will also include a summary financial account for the Project, consisting of \nproject expenditures during the period, total expenditure to date, and benefit monitoring in \naccordance with procedures and details acceptable to ADB. Performance will be evaluated on \nthe basis of indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n                                                 \n7  Where for any particular disclosure the prevailing accounting standard in Tajikistan differs from the International \nFinancial Reporting Standards, the financial statements shall, in a note to the accounts, explain the divergence. \n ", "10   \n \n10.  Project Review \n54.  ADB will field an inception mission after the grant effectiveness, and regular annual \nreview missions to discuss the latest progress and address current and emerging problems by \ndeveloping  mitigating  measures.  ADB,  together  with  the  Government  and  Barki  Tajik,  will \nundertake an in-depth midterm review of the Project 2 years after grant effectiveness to assess \nwhether the Project outcome and outputs are likely to be achieved. The midterm review will \nfocus on institutional, administrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, economic, \nfinancial, and other aspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Project and its \ncontinuing viability. \n \nG.  Executing Agency   \n1.  Corporate Overview \n55.  Barki Tajik, the Executing Agency, is the state-owned utility responsible for generation, \ntransmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s independence, it \nwas administratively a Government entity. In 1992, Barki Tajik became a state joint stock \nholding company. Although it is fully owned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys autonomous \nstatus according to its charter. In 2000, Barki Tajik was incorporated as a commercial entity, and \na formal separation of operations has taken place along its business lines. In 2004, Barki Tajik \nwas merged with the Ministry of Energy and Industry. In March 2006, this merger was revoked \nand Barki Tajik separated from the Ministry of Energy and Industry. \n \n56.  Barki  Tajik  is  managed  by  a  chair  and  a  board  of  directors  appointed  by  the \nGovernment. Ten general services departments (among them planning, accounting, and sales) \nreport directly to the Barki Tajik chair, who also manages issues of great importance, such as \nthe  power  supply  contract  with  TALCO  (the  largest  industrial  consumer  with  40%  of  total \nconsumption), or the financing of new investment projects. The overall staff of the utility totals \n11,480 people, of which about 290 work in the head office in Dushanbe. \n \n2.  Financial Management \n57.  Financial management assessment has been carried out to evaluate Barki Tajik\u2019s ability \nto fulfill ADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements. Financial management of Barki Tajik was found to be \nadequate. The financial management assessment questionnaire was used to review current \npractice. With assistance of ADB TA (footnote 3), Barki Tajik is in transition and the assessment \nwas designed to determine its potential to achieve financial and operational independence. The \nreview identified issues and constraints and made recommendations to improve budgeting, \naccounting, internal controls, audit, and legislative compliance to ensure that Barki Tajik\u2019s funds \nare efficiently and effectively utilized. \n \n58.  Barki Tajik is still receiving subsidies from the Government due to no tariff increases for \nthe  past  few  years.  As  agreed  with  donors,  the  Government  approved  a  4-year  plan  of \nincreasing  tariffs  where  Barki  Tajik  should  be  able  to  achieve  full  cost-recovery  by  2010. \nFurther, tariff increases thereafter are needed for Barki Tajik to be able to self-finance its \ninvestment plan.  \n \n  ", "11 \n \n3.  Past Financial Performance \n59.  The consolidated income statement reveals sales revenue growth during the last few \nyears. Total revenues increased from TJS217 million ($63.47 million) in 2003 to TJS379 million \n($110.85 million) in 2007. As sales in terms of kWh have been consistent for this period \n(annually around 13,500 GWh), two other factors can be attributed to this increase. First, as \ntariffs  were  constant  from  2003  to  2006  (TJS0.0016/kWh  for  residential  consumers),  the \nincrease in revenues can be attributed to improved collection and customer management. \nCollection rates improved from 83% in 2003 to 94% in 2006 (2007 figures are not available). \nSecondly, the revenue increase from 2006 to 2007 (35%) can be attributed to the increase in \ntariffs (TJS0.0024/kWh in 2007). \n \n60.  Accounts receivable remain a major problem, despite efforts to improve collections in the \npast few years. The largest debtors in 2006 were TALCO (TJS81 million) and the Ministry of \nMelioration and Water Economy (TJS41 million). A specific approach to TALCO and irrigation \npumping has to be developed with the help of the Ministry of Melioration and Water Economy in \norder to improve the payment discipline of the customers. Barki Tajik should be more persistent \nin  resolving  the  issue  of  the  long-term  debt  of  TALCO  through  finding  efficient  means  to \nstimulate the company to respect past agreements and to start repaying debts. International \nfinancial institution covenants have continued to pressure Barki Tajik to improve (and/or write \noff) accounts receivable from TALCO and other debtors.  \n \n4.  Financial Projections \n61.  Cost recovery is assumed, with tariff increases approved to 2010 ($0.0182/kWh in 2009 \nand $0.025/kWh in 2010). In order for the assumed investment program to be sustainable, \ntariffs will be further increased to $0.030/kWh in 2014 and $0.040/kWh in 2016. With collections \nimproving to 90% in 2016 from the current 80%, it is projected that there will be a gradual \nimprovement in Barki Tajik\u2019s financial performance and position during the planning period from \n2009 to 2033. \n \n62.  The projections have been designed so that Barki Tajik will be a self-sustainable entity \nwithout any support from the Government. The results show that total revenues are expected to \nincrease from $203 million in 2009 to $2,023 million in 2033, and Barki Tajik is projected to \nmake a reasonable profit annually (with an average 15% profit margin). Cash available over \ndebt service is also projected to be greater than debt payments for the span of the projections. \nBarki Tajik is currently able to generate 17,493 GWh using its own resources and is not able to \nsupply total domestic demand (assumed at 19,000 GWh for 2009). In addition, the projections \nassume a 2.5% increase in demand starting in 2012. The deficit and future increase in demand \nwill be covered by hydropower and thermal independent power producers (IPPs) coming on \nline, starting in 2009. The projections have assumed Barki Tajik will purchase hydropower from \nthe IPPs for $0.035/kWh escalated at 5% per annum, and thermal (starting in 2016) power for \n$0.070/kWh with the same escalation factor. Moreover, Barki Tajik is estimated to undergo \napproximately $1 billion rehabilitation and new capital expenditure program over the next 10\u201315 \nyears. In order to sufficiently cover such capital expenditure and its daily operations, including \npower purchases from the IPPs, average tariffs to consumers are projected to increase from \n$0.018/kWh in 2009 to $0.080/kWh in 2033, an average increase of 7.3% per annum.  \n \n ", "12   \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Financial and Economic Benefits  \n63.  Financial Benefits. Financial analysis of the Project was carried out in accordance with \nADB guidelines.8 All financial costs and benefits were expressed at constant 2008 prices. Cost \nstreams used to determine the financial internal rate of return\u2014i.e. capital investment, operation \nand maintenance, insurance costs, and taxes\u2014reflect the costs of delivering the estimated \nbenefits. The wheeling charges were computed from the current approved tariffs and have been \nused on an annually fixed basis to estimate the revenue, while incremental operation and \nmaintenance costs were charged for each year. \n \n64.  The  Project\u2019s  financial  internal  rate  of  return  of  9.3%  compares  favorably  with  the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 2.54%, indicating financial viability of the Project. \nFinancial viability was gauged by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with- and \nwithout-project investment scenarios. The incremental benefits arise from the availability of \npower through the transmission system due to the improved substation, whereas the without-\nproject scenario foresees a deterioration of the assets leading to increasing operational costs \nand constraints in transmitting the generated electricity to the transmission line. Nonquantifiable \nbenefits such as geological incidents were not included in the financial evaluation. Summary \nfinancial analysis is in Appendix 10. \n \n65.  For both the financial and economic analyses, with- and without-project scenarios have \nbeen  modeled  to  compare  the  overall  net  benefits  of  the  Project.  The  major  benefits  are \nidentified as follows: \n \n(i)  Less outages and better reliability. The relocation and/or reconstruction of the \nswitchyards does not lead to increased energy generation, and thus does not \ngenerate incremental increase in revenues. However, the Project secures the \nfuture flow of revenue to Barki Tajik. If the switchyard is not reconstructed, the \nexisting switchyard will gradually break down, disrupt the energy supply from \nNurek HEPP, and result in a loss of revenue from energy sales. Thus, the \nsecured revenue from future energy generation may be attributed to the Project. \n \n(ii)  Elimination of geological avoidance and related costs. Although geological \nevents are an issue with the existing switchyard (both landslide and subsidence \nof the existing switchyard site), due to the unpredictability of geological events no \nanalysis has been done with regard to a hypothetical landslide and subsidence. \nHowever,  for  the  without-project  scenario,  subsidence  prevention  costs  have \nbeen included initially at $30,000 in 2009, escalating by a factor of $50,000 per \nannum due to the increased difficulties of prevention measures year after year. \nAs the Project will be moved to a different location, the investment scenario does \nnot include this cost as there is no subsidence. \n \n66.  Economic Benefits. The Project is least cost. It is a part of Tajikistan\u2019s integrated \ngeneration  and  transmission  expansion  plan,  and  an  integrated  component  of  providing \nTajikistan\u2019s  major  source  of  generation  using  least-cost  planning  principles.  The  economic \nanalysis  was  based  on  a  time-slice  approach  to  the  Project.  The  Project  will  stabilize \ntransmission of the majority of Tajikistan\u2019s electricity generation to the population. Cost\u2013benefit \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.  Manila. \n  ", "13 \n \nprojections were prepared and analyzed by the Project, and it was judged to be economically \nviable. A summary of the economic analysis is provided in Appendix 7. \n \n67.  The economic internal rate of return was estimated at 36.7% based on the incremental \ncost\u2013benefit streams associated with the Project. Economic performance was evaluated by \ncomparing with- and without-project scenarios. The economic internal rate of return compares \nthe annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against the benefits, based on \nwillingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2009 constant prices. The \nanalysis period includes the construction and operation period equal to 40 years. The main \nbenefit stems from the incremental energy provided to the population assuming that, without the \nProject,  the  switchyard  would  have  to  continuously  be  off  line  for  repair  and  subsidence \nprevention works. Economic benefits accrue to consumers and the economy as a result of the \nProject. Incremental consumption occurs because of the stable availability of adequate and \nreliable power supplies. \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Impacts \n68.  The Project does not entail land acquisition and resettlement (LAR) and does not involve \nindigenous peoples. The Project is categorized as category C both in terms of involuntary \nresettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  impact.  The  summary  poverty  reduction  and  social \nstrategy is presented in Appendix 8. \n \n69.  The Project will result in approximately 50 new skilled and unskilled temporary jobs \nbeing created for construction. Adherence to ADB's core labor standards9 and the Labor Law \n(1997) of Tajikistan will be included in the Grant Agreement and the bidding documents for the \nturnkey contract. Requirement for education on HIV/AIDS and prohibition of child labor will also \nbe indicated in the Grant Agreement and the bidding documents. These items will be monitored \nby the PMU and will be reported to ADB through periodical progress reports.  \n \n70.  The Project is not expected to deliver direct benefits to the poor since the Project is the \nreconstruction of an existing switchyard that evacuates generated power of Nurek HEPP to the \nnational grid. The Project will ensure stable and reliable supply of power that will contribute to \nthe development of the national economy. Given that Nurek HEPP is responsible for over 70% \nof the electricity generated in Tajikistan, the Project is expected to result in indirect benefits to \nthe majority of the population of Tajikistan, including the poor. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact \n71.  The Project is categorized as category B in terms of environmental impact. An initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) report was prepared in accordance with ADB's Environment \nPolicy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003).10 The IEE confirmed that only \nminor impacts are expected during the construction phase of the Project. All construction works \nof the new switchyard and dismantling of the old switchyard takes place within the fenced \ncompound of the Nurek HEPP, which has been in operation for over 30 years. The construction \nworks  involve  disposal  of  spoil.  The  spoil  bank  is  located  just  outside  the  Nurek  HEPP \ncompound  in  an  area  which  was  once  the  borrow  area  for  excavating  materials  for  the \nconstruction of the dam body. Barki Tajik has been granted the land-use rights, and the area \nhas been used until very recently as a spoil bank to deposit dredged materials from downstream \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

Most of the parts and materials generated from dismantling of the existing \nswitchyard will be used as spares in other 500 kV substations, and old metals (steel, copper, \nand aluminum) will be sold to local recycling companies. \n \n72.  The IEE report contains an environmental management and monitoring plan and an \nindicative budget for the purchasing of monitoring devices. The IEE will be updated by the \nturnkey contractor once the detailed design is completed. No civil works will be permitted to \ncommence until the updated IEE is approved by ADB. The summary IEE is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix F. \n \nD.  Project Risks and Assumptions \n73.  The Project is technically complicated given its advanced technology content and the \nneed for the two new switchyards to be integrated both with each other and with the existing \npower station. However, the overall technical risk is deemed to be low based on \n \n(i)  the probability of repeat of poor ground conditions at the new site location being \nremote, as a detailed geological survey confirming the suitability of the new site \nwas carried out during the feasibility study stage; \n(ii)  the  implementation  consultant  being  selected  using  a  technical-financial \nweighting of 90:10, thereby putting a high emphasis on quality; \n(iii)  the  existing  PMU,  which  has  experience  on  similar  donor-funded  projects, \nimplementing the Project; \n(iv)  technically and economically viable bids, which are expected following consultant \ninteraction with potential bidders during the feasibility study stage; \n(v)  bidder  qualification  criteria  that  will  ensure  that  only  competent  and  proven \ncontractors are eligible to bid; \n(vi)  parallel  implementation  of  a  related  220  kV  switchyard  project,  which  is  on \nschedule  with  signing  of  loan  agreement  and  selection  of  implementation \nconsultant having been completed; and \n(vii)  implementation risk of the 500 kV project being minimized, with the proposed \nselection of a turnkey contractor who will have single overall responsibility. \n \n74.  Rehabilitation of the nine turbine and generators of Nurek HEPP is not included in the \nProject but will need to be carried out in the medium term. It is assumed that total failure of \nNurek HEPP will not occur as the nine units operate independently of each other and any one \nunit can be repaired and rehabilitated at the time of failure, as has been recent practice. \nMeanwhile, the Government is seeking funds in the amount of $300 million to rehabilitate the \nnine turbine and generators. The Nurek dam structure is in good condition and is not in need of \nrehabilitation.   \n \n75.  At a policy level, it is assumed that the Government will implement full cost-recovery \ntariffs. The project facilitates such a policy through the requirement that repayments by Barki \nTajik to the Government of the subsidiary loan will be used exclusively to support poor and \nvulnerable  electricity  consumers.  It  is  also  assumed  that  the  Government  is  committed  to \nmaking available the necessary investments to rehabilitate and develop the electricity sector.  \n \n76.  At an institutional level, it is assumed that Barki Tajik will (i) implement needed reform \nwith the modernization of its governance and corporate procedures, and (ii) deliver on its \nassurances to improve collection levels and adequately fund operation and maintenance. The \nongoing ADB technical assistance (footnote 3) is supporting these reforms in this regard.  \n  ", "15 \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n77.

Tajikistan possesses vast amounts of hydroelectric (40 gigawatt [GW]) and coal (3,600 \nmillion  tons)  energy  resources  of  which  only  a  small  fraction  (4,060  megawatts  [MW]  of \nhydroelectric  installed  capacity  and  60,000  tons  of  coal  production  per  annum)  has  been \nexploited. The country faces energy deficits and cannot meet its winter demand, with the deficits \nin the winter of 2007/2008 being particularly severe.   \n2.  The predominance of hydroelectric-based energy creates a problem for Tajikistan as \nhydropower production exceeds demand in summer and is reduced in winter when glacial melt \nis least and demand is most. As a result, Tajikistan imports electricity and fossil fuels in winter to \nmeet energy needs. In summer electricity is exported, but there is excess water due to low \nelectricity demand and insufficient water storage facilities.   \n3.  Per capita domestic energy consumption is high given the country's level of economic \ndevelopment. This is because of the low end-use efficiency and high heating requirements \nduring winter. With the rise in prices of imported fuel, households have switched to electricity for \nheating  and  cooking,  reflecting  the  fact  that  electricity  is  the  only  form  of  reliable  energy \navailable and that the Government\u2019s historical below-cost pricing policies have encouraged a \nshift to electricity away from other forms of energy. \n4.  Until recently, average electricity tariffs were considerably below cost-recovery levels at \n$0.006 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). However, the Government is now committed to bringing the \naverage tariff to a more financially viable level of $0.025/kWh (in 2003 terms) by the end of \n2010. In the gas sector, the current tariffs have been increased so that they are closer to the \nfinancial viability levels. Coal prices are market based. \nB.  Institutional Structure \n5.  At the policy and regulatory level, the Fuel and Energy Department in the Office of the \nPresident has overall responsibility for the energy sector. The Ministry of Energy and Industry, \nestablished in October 2000, is responsible for coordinating the Government's energy policy. \n ", "  Appendix 2  21\nThe Ministry of Economic Development and Trade regulates the prices of electricity, natural \ngas, and district heat. This committee reports directly to the Office of the President. The Ministry \nof Environmental Protection is responsible for environmental regulation of energy operations. \nThe Committee on State Property exercises ownership functions over state-owned assets. \n \n6.  Barki Tajik, a joint stock company 100% owned by the state, is a vertically integrated \nutility responsible for generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in Tajikistan, except \nin Gorno Badakshan Autonomous Oblast where the privately owned Pamir Energy operates all \npower facilities under a 25-year concession granted in 2002.  \n \n7.  In the natural gas sector, Tajik Gas was formed as a state unitary enterprise responsible \nfor import, transmission, and distribution of gas in the country. In the heating sector, three \ninstitutions are responsible: (i) Barki Tajik, (ii) the Dushanbe District Heating System Enterprise \nowned by the municipality, and (iii) the State Unitary Enterprise of Housing and Communal \nServices. \n \n8.  The  state  coal  mining  company,  Tajikangisht,  was  abolished  in  2003  and  the \nDepartment of Coal in the Ministry of Energy and Industry was given the responsibility to \ncorporatize and privatize the coal mines. One coal mine (Shurab) has been corporatized as a \njoint stock company; another (Rovnov) has become a joint-venture private company.  \n \nC.  Power Sector \n9.  The power sector alone represents up to 5% of gross domestic product and is a critical \ninput for the main exports of cotton and aluminum. Despite this, no significant investments have \nbeen made since the country\u2019s independence in 1991, leading to a deterioration of the physical \ninfrastructure, which in turn results in high network losses and reduced reliability. In addition, \ncommercial losses are high, partly due to the legacy of supplying energy without meters and \npartly due to the lack of commercial orientation within the utilities.  \n \n10.  Tajikistan\u2019s transmission network consists of three separate grids: (i) one in the north of \n220 kilovolt (kV) connecting the sole hydropower plant (Kairaikum, 240 MW capacity), (ii) the \ncentral grid with an installed generation capacity of 3,895 MW, and (iii) one in the west in the \nGorno Badakshan region. \n \n11.  Annual hydropower energy output is about 16,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) and electricity \nis delivered to nearly 100% of the population. On average, Tajikistan has a summer (May\u2013\nSeptember)  surplus  of  1,500  GWh  available  for  export  with  an  unmet  demand  of  2,500 \nmegawatt-hours (MWh) over the remaining non-summer months.

Barki Tajik, the vertically integrated power utility, consists of a network of 10 subsidiary \npower  generation  companies,  11  subsidiary  distribution  companies,  and  8  supporting \ncompanies (such as a research institute and a construction company). It serves a customer \nbase of approximately 1 million people and employed 11,200 staff in 2007. Barki Tajik is in poor \nfinancial condition following years of below-cost tariffs, high losses, and poor collection rates. \nThe private Pamir Energy operates the existing 40 MW of generation and transmission and \ndistribution system in the western Gorno Badakshan region serving a population of 200,000. \n \n14.  New large generation projects are being constituted as new joint stock companies (e.g. \nSangtuda I joint stock company has been formed for completing the construction of the large \nrun-of-river Sangtuda I hydroelectric project). Installed power generation capacity, at 4,405 MW, \nmainly comprises six hydropower plants totaling 4,060 MW and two fossil fuel-fired combined \nheat and power stations totaling 345 MW. Nurek is by far the largest hydropower plant and has \n ", "  Appendix 2  23\nbeen in operation since 1972 with an installed capacity of 3,000 MW. It provides regulation of \nthe Vakhsh River and gives stability to the power system in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n \nD.  Problems and Opportunities \n15.  The main issues faced by the Tajik energy sector are: \n \n(i)  despite  well-developed  infrastructure,  the  country  faces  energy  deficits  and \ncannot meet its winter demand; \n(ii)  the infrastructure is in poor technical condition with the problem compounded by \na shift in electricity consumption patterns; \n(iii)  the  historically  low  level  of  electricity  pricing  impedes  necessary  resource \nmobilization; \n(iv)  the  institutional  framework  does  not  reflect  the  needs  of  a  market-oriented \neconomy, and lacks commercial orientation;  \n(v)  the state-owned enterprise Barki Tajik needs major restructuring; and \n(vi)  despite having abundant electricity generation potential, including some partly \ncompleted hydropower resources and some power-hungry electricity markets in \nneighboring countries, the country is exploiting this potential suboptimally. \n \n16.  In 2005, Tajikistan developed a strategy based on a two-track approach for the domestic \nand export markets. The first track focuses on the domestic market, and comprises a set of \npolicy and investment measures aimed to bring the sector to reasonable operating conditions \nand improve its financial viability. The policy measures include (i) the implementation of a \nmedium-term tariff policy; (ii) a social protection policy for energy services to improve the \neffectiveness of the scheme and ensure a more targeted approach to support the poor; and (iii) \nan institutional reform policy for the energy sector to improve the transparency and efficiency of \noperations, enable electricity trade, and pave the way for private sector participation in the \nsector. The investment measures include implementation of programs for (i) increased energy \nefficiency; (ii) demand-side management including a heat supply strategy; and (iii) increasing \nenergy supply to meet winter demand, with focus on rehabilitation of existing assets. The \nsecond track focuses on increasing electricity exports by (i) using existing seasonal surpluses in \nthe summer, and (ii) attracting private sector investors to join in developing newer hydroelectric \nand thermal capacities for exports to neighboring and regional countries.   \n \nE.  Current Power Sector Developments \n17.  Winter supply deficit continues to be a problem despite imports of electricity from the \nKyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Barki Tajik is implementing improved rationing \nprocedures whereby load shedding commences earlier in the season resulting in improved \nsupply during the coldest winter months. However, solution of the winter deficit problem will \nrequire  new  HEPPs  with  seasonal  storage  capacity  and/or  additional  thermal  generation \ncapacity. Regarding possible new thermal generation, a United States Trade and Development \nAgency-funded study, due to commence in 2008, will examine the viability of commercial coal \nmine developments for which a thermal power plant would be a potential customer. \n18.  The Sangtuda1 670 MW HEPP, 70% owned by RAO UES of Russia and 30% by the \nGovernment, is under construction, with completion scheduled for 2009. Following the Shanghai \nCooperation  Organization  meeting  in  Tajikistan  in  August  2009,  the  governments  of  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China and the Russian Federation have signed agreements with the \n ", "24  Appendix 2   \nGovernment of Tajikistan to finance four new HEPPs, three of which will be financed by the \nRussian Federation (the largest with a capacity of 250 MW), and one by the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (with a capacity of 200 MW). Tajikistan continues to promote the development of the \nRogun 3,600 MW HEPP, construction of which started during the Soviet era but has since been \nsuspended. A World Bank-funded feasibility study is due to commence in 2008. This major \nproject  would  serve  the  dual  purposes  of  meeting  Tajikistan  winter  demand  and  allowing \nTajikistan to export the considerable surplus energy.   \n19.  An ADB-funded technical assistance project (footnote 3) is assisting the Ministry of \nEnergy and Industry in preparing options for the restructuring of Barki Tajik, and in implementing \nthose options, with project completion due in 2010.   \n20.  The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade and Barki Tajik have agreed upon an \napproach to tariff rationalization and increase. Tariff categories have been reduced to six (albeit \nwith further subgroups) and favorable tariffs for low-usage customers and special summer and \nwinter tariffs for Tajikistan Aluminum Company have been eliminated. The weighed average \ntariff is forecast to be $0.025/kWh in 2010, a three times increase of the average tariff from \n2007,  with  the  most  recent  increase  approved  in  July  2008.  Nevertheless,  further  tariff \nrationalization and increases are required to eliminate cross subsidies and fully cover Barki Tajik \ncosts. \n21.  The first track of the Government\u2019s strategy\u2014to focus on the domestic market\u2014is being \nsupported by the multilateral and bilateral donor community through a range of rehabilitation \nprojects (Appendix 3). The proposed Nurek 500 kV Reconstruction Project, which will enable \ncontinued electricity supply to Tajikistan, is consistent with this strategy. The second track of the \nGovernment\u2019s  strategy\u2014to  focus  on  the  export  market\u2014is  being  implemented  with  (i)  the \nsigning of loans for the construction of the Afghanistan\u2013Tajikistan transmission interconnection, \nand (ii) the ongoing development of the Central Asia\u2013South Asia Regional Electricity Market \nProject1 which envisages the building of a high-voltage transmission interconnection to allow \nelectricity exports from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan to Afghanistan and Pakistan, both of \nwhich are energy deficient.   \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

Background \n1.  The  Nurek  500  kV  Switchyard  Reconstruction  Project  to  be  funded  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is part of Tajikistan\u2019s plan to rehabilitate the Nurek Hydroelectric \nPower Plant (HEPP) and facilities using least-cost planning principles. The economic analysis is \nbased on a time-slice approach to the rehabilitation plan. The economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) compares the annual streams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits \nbased on willingness to pay. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2009 constant \nprices. The analysis period includes the construction period and 40 years of operation. Details \nof  the  assumptions  and  calculations  used  for  the  economic  analysis  are  presented  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  C.  In  the  absence  of  this  Project,  there  will  be  chronic  supply \nshortages. Demand forecasts and cost\u2013benefit projections were prepared and analyzed, and \nthey indicated that the Project is economically viable. The economic analysis confirms that the \nProject is economically viable. \n \nB.  Least-Cost Analysis \n2.  The least-cost analysis serves to show that the Project is the least-cost solution for the \nreliable supply of power to Tajikistan and to the Central Asian power transmission grid. There is \nno  viable  alternative  to  relocation  of  the  switchyards  and  construction  of  gas-insulated \nswitchgear switchyards. \n \nC.  Economic Assumptions \n3.  The  calculation  for  the  economic  analysis  is  based  on,  among  other  things,  the \nassumptions included in Table A7.1. \n \nTable A7.1: Economic Assumptions \nItem  Assumptions \nShadow Pricing  Conversion factor: 0.9 for local materials and 0.75 for unskilled \nlabor a\nCosts and Benefits  Constant 2009 prices \nDiscount Rate  12% \nDecommissioning Costs  None \nResettlement, Land Acquisition  None \nO&M  $60,000 and major overhaul of $200,000 every 10 years; O&M \nhigher than existing equipment due to the high-tech nature of gas-\ninsulated switchgear technology \nConstruction Period  3 years \nEconomic Life  50 years \nAverage Annual Generation  11,250 GWh, 500 kV switchyard transmits 7,500 GWh \nGWh = gigawatt-hour, kV = kilovolt, O&M = operation and maintenance. \na    Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2000.

The economic analysis assumes that, in regards to the \nwithout-project scenario, Barki Tajik does not have funds to rehabilitate the whole 500 kilovolt \n(kV) switchyard at once, and would rehabilitate the switchyard over a 10-year period using new \nair-insulated switchgear technology at $1 million per annum on the existing site. Although there \nis subsidence, for purposes of analyzing the scenario, prevention measures are taken annually \nwith costs increasing by $50,000 per annum. A catastrophic scenario with regard to a landslide \nor subsidence has been ignored for purposes of the economic analysis. \n \n5.  Annual output of the Nurek HEPP via the 500 kV switchyard is assumed to decrease by \n60% during the 10 years of rehabilitation. Once rehabilitation is complete, the switchyard is \nassumed to transmit 90% of the total energy of 7,500 gigawatt-hours (GWh) due to shutdowns \nbecause of subsidence prevention measures and minor landslides. \n \nD.  Quantification of Benefits \n6.  The benefits of avoided equipment breakdown and avoided geological catastrophes can \nbe quantified in terms of avoided loss of energy, measured in kWh. Additionally, the avoided \ncosts of risk mitigation and of repairs after equipment failures, measured in US dollars, have to \nbe considered. In the following, the avoided loss of energy and the avoided mitigation costs are \nquantified separately for the geological risk and for the breakdown of aging equipment. The \nimpact of loss of energy on the other economies in Central Asia cannot be quantified and is \ntherefore not further considered in the following quantitative analysis. \n \n1.  Effect of Equipment Breakdown \n7.  The switchyard is over 35 years old and worn out. As explained in para. 5, the without-\nproject scenario foresees failures of individual components and increased shutdowns forcing \nBarki Tajik to rehabilitate using its own funds. During 10 years of rehabilitation, the model \nassumes 60% of the generated electricity to be transmitted though the 500 kV switchyard, and \n90% thereafter. \n \n2.  Effect of Geological Risk \n8.  The subsidence in the 500 kV switchyard destabilizes the equipment. In order to avoid \nthe collapse of towers, Barki Tajik monitors the areas for sinkholes, fills them, adds extensions \nto the legs of the towers and strengthens the foundations with concrete. In the without-project \ncase, this procedure needs to be continued at an annual cost of approximately $30,000. So far, \nthis procedure has successfully prevented equipment failure and no energy was lost due to \nuplifting and/or subsidence. It is assumed that in the future the mitigation measures will continue \nto  be  successful.  The  annual  cost  is  increased  by  $50,000  per  annum  due  to  increased \ndifficulties of uplifting and/or subsidence as time goes by. \n \nE.  Valuation of Benefits \n9.  The avoided cost of risk mitigation and damage repair is expressed in monetary terms \nas explained above, but the monetary value of the lost energy also needs to be determined for \nthe economic analysis. There are several options for this valuation: \n \n ", "34   Appendix 7 \n1.  Cost of Unserved Energy \n10.  The economic costs of unserved energy have been estimated in numerous studies. In \nthe literature on economic costs of outages, costs are generally broken down into short- and \nlong-run costs. Short-run costs comprise product spoilage and damage to machinery, shutdown \nand restart costs, forgone revenues from underutilized production capacities. Long-run costs are \nmainly identified with the cost of mitigating the effects of power outages with standby generators \nor by switching completely to self-generation. Estimates for the cost of unserved energy depend \non the country and the consumer category; they range between $0.10 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \nand $0.50 per kWh for households, and over $1/kWh for commercial and industrial consumers. \n \n2.  Willingness to Pay \n11.  The willingness of consumers to pay for electricity is usually derived from the amount \nspent on other sources of energy when electricity is not available, such as candles, kerosene, \nand stand-by generators. This amount depends on the uses of electricity and is different for \nparticular groups and consumers. In the evaluation of ADB projects in the past,1 the willingness \nto pay was estimated at $0.20/kWh based on the cost of auto-generation at a 10% utilization \nfactor. The Power Sector Development Project2 valued the unserved energy at twice the long-\nrun marginal cost, or at $0.042/kWh, which was also equivalent to the average import tariff. \n \n3.  Value of Energy Import \n12.  It is unlikely that the Government of Tajikistan will not look for other sources of supply \nwhen the supply from Nurek HEPP is interrupted. The contribution of the Tajik Aluminum \nCompany (TALCO, a major aluminum joint stock company in Tajikistan and by far the largest \ncustomer of Barki Tajik) to the gross domestic product of Tajikistan is considered so important \nthat in the winter, when domestic energy supply is insufficient, energy for TALCO is imported \nfrom Uzbekistan at an import tariff much higher than the tariff paid by TALCO. It is therefore \nmethodologically not justified to value the lost energy in the without-project situation at the cost \nof unserved energy (damage cost and mitigation cost) or at the willingness to pay. \n \n13.  It  is  more  appropriate  to  use  the  value  of  alternative  sources  of  electricity  supply, \nincluding import from Uzbekistan (currently at $0.015/kWh with a capacity of 1,200 MW) and \ngeneration from Sangtuda I and Rogun HEPPs. Sangtuda is expected to be operational in 2010, \nwhile Rogun is planned to be commissioned later. Both plants are built to serve the export \nmarket, but in an emergency situation the energy could be diverted for domestic use. The value \nof this energy is then equal to the forgone export tariff, estimated at $0.02\u2013$0.03/kWh. For the \npurpose of the economic analysis, an average value of $0.02/kWh is used. \n \nF.  Results \n14.  The EIRR and the net present value for the Project has been calculated. The Project \nwas evaluated on the basis of avoided loss of energy, costs of maintenance (both periodic and \ncapital),  and  capital  expenditures.  The  results  are  summarized  in  Table  A7.2.  Detailed \ncalculations are contained in Table A7.3.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

The sensitivity of the project economics to changes in key variables was tested and the \nresults are included in Table A7.2. In general, the EIRRs are not highly sensitive and exceed the \neconomic hurdle rates for scenarios tested. The implication is that the Project is rehabilitating \nwhat  is  currently  a  key  bottleneck  of  economic  development  and  needs  to  be  urgently \nimplemented  to  prevent  chronic  shortages.  On  this  basis,  the  Project  appears  to  be \neconomically viable. \n \n16.  Conclusions. The analysis verifies that the Project is economically viable, producing a \nrange of estimated EIRRs of between 24.3% and the base case at 36.7%. All the scenarios \nhave an EIRR greater than the economic discount rate. There are, however, no alternative \noptions for the Project\u2014location of the switchyard in different sites within the Nurek HEPP \ncompound would give the same economic benefits, but would increase the cost of the Project. \nThe  Project  continues  to  be  viable  and  sustainable  for  a  reasonable  range  of  downside \nscenarios. \n ", "36   Appendix 7 \nTable A7.3: Detailed

West Asia Department/ \nLending/Financing Modality:  Project / Grant \nDivision:  Infrastructure Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper of the Republic of Tajikistan (June 2002) recognizes that availability of adequate \ninfrastructure is an essential element in achieving satisfactory economic growth, which in turn provides the means for \nreducing poverty. It also recognizes the urgent need for rehabilitating the energy infrastructure currently in a serious state of \ndisrepair. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2019s country strategy and program update 2006\u20132008a for Tajikistan also \nidentifies stable power supply as one of its key interventions and mentions this Nurek 500 kV Switchyard Reconstruction \nProject. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification:  General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nAs the Project is the reconstruction of an existing switchyard that feeds power to the national grid, it is not expected to deliver \nimmediate direct benefits to the poor. \nThe Project is the reconstruction of the existing 500 kilovolt (kV) switchyard of the 3,000 megawatt (MW) Nurek Hydroelectric \nPower Plant (HEPP) commissioned in 1972. Nurek HEPP supplies 75% of Tajikistan's electricity and, as one of the largest \npower plants in Central Asia, it plays the role of controlling the frequency of the Central Asian power system, which includes \ngrids of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The existing switchyard is obsolete with limited spare \nparts available and is also constructed on top of a salt dome where land subsidence has been experienced for over a decade. \nThe loss of the switchyard will have catastrophic ramifications, as electricity generated from Nurek HEPP will not be able to be \nevacuated. The reconstruction will ensure stable and reliable supply of power, which will contribute to the development of the \nnational economy and, therefore, can be expected to result in indirect benefits to the poor. \n2. Design Features \n \nOpportunity to include a pro-poor design is limited as the Project broadly benefits the economy. Employment opportunities for \nthe poor and vulnerable are also limited as the number of laborers to be hired is minimal. \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nn/a \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nNo negative social impacts are envisaged as the Project is implemented within the fenced premises of Nurek HEPP owned by \nBarki Tajik, the national power utility, except for the spoil bank. The new 500 kV switchyard will be constructed on the existing \n220 kV switchyard site. Both switchyards are in the Nurek HEPP compound. \nSpoil from excavation will be disposed in the designated spoil bank just outside the Nurek HEPP compound. The local \ngovernment has granted Barki Tajik the use of this plot of land. The spoil bank area once used to be the borrow site to \nexcavate materials for the construction of the Nurek dam body some 30 years ago. It has since been used intensively by Barki \nTajik. Until recently, the area was used as a spoil bank to dispose of sediments dredged from the Vakhsh River downstream \nof Nurek HEPP tailrace in the Vakhsh River Excavation subproject under the ADB Loan 1817-TAJ: Power Rehabilitation \nProject.b\nThe Project will result in approximately 50 new temporary jobs being created for construction, including both skilled and \nunskilled labor. Adherence to ADB's core labor standardsc and the Labor Law of Tajikistan (1997) will be included in the Grant \nAgreement and the bidding documents for the turnkey contract. Requirement for education on HIV/AIDS and prohibition of \nchild labor will also be indicated in the Grant Agreement and the bidding documents. These items will be monitored by the \nproject management unit and will be reported to ADB through quarterly progress reports.  \nResidential quarters of the laborers to be hired by the Project will be located outside the Nurek HEPP compound due to \nsecurity reasons. The contractor will lease one of the several vacant factory yards available in the vicinity of Nurek HEPP. For \nexample, the contractor for the aforementioned ADB loan subproject leased an abandoned factory yard just a few hundred \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \n \nmeters from Nurek HEPP. \nAs seen from the above, the Project does not entail land acquisition, resettlement, or any negative social impacts. \nAs Nurek HEPP supplies 75% of the electricity consumed in the country, a reliable 500 kV switchyard that evacuates power \nfrom Nurek HEPP is beneficial to the entire nation. The poor and the non-poor will benefit equally from the Project directly \nthrough the supply of electricity from the Project if they are users of electricity and indirectly through the development of the \nTajik economy. \nB.  Consultation and Participation  \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nNo negative social impacts are envisaged, but a public consultation was held in accordance with ADB's Environment Policy \n(2002). Public consultation was held on 11 September 2008 at the Nurek City Administration Office and attended by \napproximately 70 participants. No concerns were raised over the Project. \n \n2.

Barki \nTajik  has  the  ability  to  undertake  and  fulfill  fiduciary  requirements  for  the  Nurek  500  kV \nSwitchyard Reconstruction Project. Financial management assessment questionnaires and field \ninterviews  were  used  to  review  the  present  standing  of  financial  management.  Due \nconsideration has been given to the fact that Barki Tajik is in transition from being a vertically \nintegrated  government  company  to  a  fully  independent  corporate  entity.  Progress  on \nstrengthening corporate governance and financial management is under way. \n \n1.  Corporate Structure \n2.  Barki  Tajik  is  the  state-owned  utility  responsible  for  generation,  transmission,  and \ndistribution of electricity in Tajikistan. Prior to the country\u2019s independence, Barki Tajik was \nadministratively a Government entity. A detailed corporate structure and an analysis of Barki \nTajik\u2019s financial management is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n3.  In 1992, Barki Tajik became a state joint stock holding company. Although it is fully \nowned by the Government, Barki Tajik enjoys autonomous status according to its charter. In \n2000, Barki Tajik was incorporated as a commercial entity and a formal separation of operations \ntook place along its business lines. In 2004, Barki Tajik was merged with the Ministry of Energy \nand Industry. In March 2006, this merger was revoked and Barki Tajik separated from the \nMinistry of Energy and Industry. \n \n4.  Barki  Tajik  is  managed  by  a  chair  and  a  board  of  directors  appointed  by  the \nGovernment. Ten general services departments (among them planning, accounting, and sales) \nreport directly to the Barki Tajik chair, who also manages issues of great importance, such as \nthe  power  supply  contract  with  Tajik  Aluminum  Company  (TALCO,  the  largest  industrial \nconsumer with 40% of total consumption), or the financing of new investment projects. The \noverall staff of the utility is about 11,480 people, of whom about 290 work in the head office in \nDushanbe. \n \nB.  Financial Management Issues and Mitigating Measures \n \n5.  The financial sustainability of the power transmission sector is dependent on timely and \naccurate  (i)  submission  of  tariff  applications  by  Barki  Tajik,  (ii)  execution  of  the  tariff \ndetermination by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, (iii) notification of the tariff \ndetermination  by  the  Government,  and  (iv)  collection  of  payments  from  customers.  As  for \ncorporate issues, Barki Tajik has financial and management independence issues that need to \nbe remedied. \n \n1.  Tariff Issues \n \n6.  In the tariff determination, the revenue requirement to cover general establishment and \nadministrative expenses, repair and maintenance, depreciation, and costs are determined by \nBarki Tajik\u2019s planning department and are submitted to the Ministry of Economic Development \nand Trade. \n \n7.  Tariffs are supposed to be regulated by the Anti Monopoly Commission, which played a \n   ", "          Appendix 9      41   \n \nregulatory role until 2006. After the election in 2007, the Cabinet of Ministers was reorganized \nand  the  regulatory  body  was  integrated  as  a  department  within  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment and Trade. However, neither before the reorganization nor after did the regulator \nexercise its function of independent tariff setting. Due to the high political and social sensitivity \nof electricity tariffs in transition countries, it is typical that the governments are the ultimate \ninstitution in the approval process. On a semiannual basis Barki Tajik proposes tariff increases, \ntrying to reach cost-recovery level, but in the past these have either not been approved or only \npartially accepted by the Government. \n \n8.  The current process is relatively new and before tariff increases for 2008 were approved, \ntariffs had not been raised for the last 5 years. Currently, after submission by Barki Tajik, the \napplication for the new tariff is reviewed by the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade \nand is sent to the Government and is ultimately approved by the President. \n \n9.  Due to pressures from the international financial institutions (IFIs), tariffs were calculated \nup to 2010 and approved by the President in January 2008. It is not known if this system will \nwork for tariffs after 2010; however, the IFIs take comfort from the fact that the Government is \nserious in its efforts in restructuring and eventual unbundling and privatizing of Barki Tajik. \n \n2.  Financial Independence \n \n10.  Barki Tajik has direct access to foreign exchange for the purchase of spare parts and \nother equipment, but the company is unable to finance new investment and the necessary \nrehabilitation of its aging power system from its own cash flow. The gap is only partially filled by \nsubsidies  from  the  Government.  Funds  from  foreign  donors  are  given  to  the  Government \nthrough the Ministry of Finance who onlends them to Barki Tajik. Even in the cases when the \nbilateral aid takes the forms of grants, the funds are onlent with an interest rate to the utility, in \norder to give Barki Tajik ownership of and responsibility for the funds. \n \n11.  Barki Tajik currently has satisfactory accounting capacities and established accredited \nexternal audit processes in accordance with international audit standards. In addition, Barki \nTajik has developed sufficient in-house functions and systems to handle payments, billings, and \ncollections. \n \n12.  The plans and budgets of Barki Tajik and its business units are (i) reconciled and \napproved as integrated documents, (ii) partially commercially independent of the Government, \nand (iii) developed to meet commercial needs. However, forward projections are checked by the \nGovernment to ensure compliance with approved national socioeconomic policies. Due to the \ngeneral lack of funds, operating objectives often have to be revised downwards to a level that \ncan be realistically achieved. The constant shortage of cash renders any planning difficult. \nElaborate planning systems comprising target parameters, monitoring systems, and sanctions \nfor deviations from the targets are not workable in such a system of scarcity, which instead calls \nfor a high level of flexibility. Management cannot be held accountable for deficiencies resulting \nfrom lack of funds. However, there are appropriate sanctions for staff who fail to reach targets \nfor other reasons, e.g., billing and collection in the energy sales companies. \n \n3.  Management Independence \n \n13.  As the transition period is in process and Barki Tajik has built capacity for independence \nfrom the Government, the corporate governance structure of its board should be in accordance \nwith international best practices. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently supporting \n ", "42  Appendix 9 \nBarki Tajik\u2019s restructuring, starting with creation of a fully independent and operating board of \ndirectors. \n \nC.  Financial Performance \n \n14.  Due to the lack of tariff increases in the past years, Barki Tajik relied on subsidies from \nthe Government to pay for its commitments. As a result, Barki Tajik has not been able to fund its \noperation  and  maintenance  as  it  should  and  its  assets  have  been  deteriorating.  Due  to \nrequirements by IFIs such as ADB and the World Bank, the Government made the decision to \nincrease tariffs to a point where Barki Tajik would be able to cover its costs. Barki Tajik is also \nstarting to plan an investment program; however, continued support from the IFIs is necessary \nto improve its corporate planning and management. A detailed analysis of Barki Tajik\u2019s financial \nperformance is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \nD.  Assumptions for Financial Projections \n \n15.  Financial projections in terms of the profit and loss account, balance sheet, and cash \nflow of Barki Tajik have been prepared for 25 years from 2009 to 2033. The projections are \nbased on a consolidated look at the energy sector of Tajikistan and take into account known \ninvestments for the medium term, costs, and generation capacity. A detailed analysis of Barki \nTajik\u2019s financial projections is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n16.  The projected revenue is based on the approved tariffs for 2009 and 2010. Based on the \nmost recent tariff determination, the weighted average tariff for 2009 is $0.0182 per kilowatt-\nhour  (kWh)  for  2009  and  $0.025/kWh  for  2010.  Thereafter,  tariffs  are  increased  to \naccommodate increases in capital costs and cost of power purchases from independent power \nproducers  (IPPs)  planned  to  start  up  in  the  future.  Tariffs  are  expected  to  increase  from \n$0.0182/kWh in 2009 to $0.080/kWh in 2033. Demand is expected to increase 2.4% from 2011, \nwhile collection is assumed at 60% for the first 10 years, 70% from 2021, and 80% from 2031. \nTechnical losses are assumed at a constant 13% and commercial losses constant at 2%. \n \n17.  The main item of costs in terms of value is the purchase of electricity from the IPPs. \nSeveral IPPs are expected to go on line, with a thermal plant expected in 2014, giving the ability \nfor Barki Tajik to purchase enough power to supply winter peak demand with excess to be \nexported. Receivables are assumed at 10% of revenues and payables 15% of operating costs. \nDepreciation is assumed at 5% of fixed assets. \n \n18.  The proposed ADB grant and all other capital requirements would be channeled through \nthe Government to Barki Tajik. For the purposes of the projections, it has been assumed that \nthe onlending rate will be 5% (in line with current onlending rates to Barki Tajik) and a grace \nperiod of 5 years and repayment over 20 years. The results of the financial projections are in \nTable A9. \n \nE.  Conclusion \n \n19.  The financial management of Barki Tajik is adequate to carry out the fiduciary duties of \nthe  Project.  In  terms  of  financial  strength,  Barki  Tajik  is  receiving  subsidies  from  the \nGovernment but is expected to be self-sustainable due to a renewed commitment from the \nGovernment in terms of taxes. Barki Tajik is expected to produce enough cash flow to maintain \nits operation and meet its debt service obligations for its future investment program. The debt \nservice coverage ratio stands above 1.01 times and the self-financing ratio is satisfactory from \n   ", "          Appendix 9      43   \n \n2009 onwards. \n \n20.  In terms of management, measures are being taken to strengthen the independence and \ntransparency of the system. These steps should be adequate and appropriate; however, close \nsupport from ADB and other IFIs is necessary. \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \n2033 Projected  32,558 31,743  815  31,108  0.080 Projected  500 0.050 25          2033   2,023 33 35 26   123 27     48 48 38 (38)    1.25x    1.25x  98.4% 1.2% 4.3% 3.6%  1.3% \n2030 Projected  30,364 29,563  801  28,971  0.075 Projected  500 0.050 25          2030   1,553 122 114 86   225 67     126 126 66 (66)    1.90x    1.90x  92.2% 4.9% 13.0% 10.3%  5.5% \n2020 Projected  24,034 23,321  713  22,854  0.030 Projected  500 0.050 25      64    2020   443 85 47 35   639 238     61 125 100 (36)    1.25x    0.61x  80.8% 4.1% 94.2% 46.9%  8.0% \ns and Results 2013 2014 2015 Projected Projected Projected    19,867 21,010 21,411 19,753 20,228 20,713    114 783 698    19,358 19,823 20,299    0.025 0.025 0.025 Projected Projected Projected    500 500 500 0.035 0.035 0.035 18 18 18                64 64 64        2013 2014 2015       315 322 329 198 111 95 166 77 59 125 58 45       541 557 572 207 219 231         140 67 64 204 131 127 55 56 61 9 7 3          3.73x 2.33x 2.10x          2.56x 1.19x 1.05x    37.0% 65.5% 71.0% 26.6% 11.0% 7.8% 150.9% 142.3% 138.0% 57.6% 56.8% 56.2%    39.5% 18.0% 13.5% our, kWh = kilowatt-hour. \nn h\nmptio 2012 Projected  19,867 19,291  577  18,905  0.025 Projected  500 0.035 18      88    2012   308 195 165 123   524 195     114 201 53 35    3.83x    2.16x  36.7% 36.0% 193.5% 62.7%  40.1% gigawatt-\nAssu 2011 Projected  18,993 18,838  155  18,462  0.025 Projected  500 0.035 18      88    2011   301 165 138 103   482 175     89 177 32 56    5.51x    2.77x  45.4% 47.1% 272.2% 69.0%  34.3% GWh = \n\u2013Key  2010 Projected  18,413 18,397  16  17,661  0.025 Approved   0.035       71    2010   272 140 117 87   438 151     93 164 27 44    6.05x    3.44x  48.5% 75.4% 443.1% 76.4%  32.2% age ratio, \nions  2009 Projected  18,872 18,696  176  17,948  0.018 Approved   0.035       104    2009   203 58 38 29   409 131     (10) 93 23 81    4.05x    (0.45x)  71.5% 100.0% 1563.8% 89.2%  14.1% ce cover\nroject 2008 Planned  19,000 19,000    19,000  0.013 Actual          158    2008   143 45 45 34         39   158          68.5%     23.8% ebt servi\nP d\ncial  2007 Actual  17,493 17,493    17,493  0.010 Actual          19    2007   111 18 (5) (13)   613 162     (134)   133          84.2% (4.1%) 53.4% 26.6%  (11.3%) SCR = \nn D\n: Fina Unit   GWh GWh  GWh  GWh  $/kWh   GWh $/kWh $ million  GWh $/kWh $ million  $ million    Unit   $ million $ million $ million $ million   $ million $ million     $ million $ million $ million $ million    times times times  times  % % % %  % enditure, stimates. \n9 pe\nTable A Financial year ending Financials Supply and Demand Total Energy Supplied Total Domestic Demand  Net Surplus Energy  Projected Domestic Energy Sold  Average Tariffs Tariffs Status  Export to Afghanistan Tariff of Electricity to Afghanistan Revenues from Afghanistan  Other Export Energy Tariff Profile Total Export Revenues  Capital Expenditures    Financial year ending  Profit and Loss Total Revenue Operating Income Earnings before Tax Earnings after Tax  Balance Sheet Total Fixed Assets Long-Term Debt    Cash after Operations and CAPEX Cash Available for Debt Service Debt Service Financing    DSCR (total cash available) Lowest DSCR Average DSCR  DSCR (operating cash flow)  Operating Ratio Return on Equity Long Term Debt to Equity Equity Ratio  Profit /Revenues ative, CAPEX = capital exAsian Development Bank \n                      Key Results             Cash Flow       Ratios              ( ) = negSource: \n \n   ", "  Appendix 10  45 \n \nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis of the Project has been carried out in accordance with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.1 All financial costs and \nbenefits were expressed in 2009 prices. Cost streams used for the purposes of financial internal \nrate of return (FIRR) determination\u2014i.e., capital investment, operation and maintenance, insurance \ncosts, and taxes\u2014reflect the costs of delivering the estimated benefits. \n \nB.  Assumptions  \n2.  Capital  costs  were  estimated  in  US  dollars  expressed  in  constant  prices  over  the \nconstruction period of 3 years for the new switchyard. Capital costs were derived from local \nsources,  which  include  physical  contingencies  at  5%  of  base  costs.  Price  contingencies  and \ninterest during construction were excluded from the estimation of capital costs for the purpose of \nthe FIRR, which is in 2009 prices.  \n \n3.  Financial viability was examined by comparing the incremental costs and benefits of with- \nand without-project investment scenarios. The relocation and reconstruction of the switchyards \ndoes not lead to increased energy generation, and thus does not generate incremental increase in \nrevenues. However, the Project secures the future flow of revenues to Barki Tajik. If the switchyard \nis not reconstructed, the existing switchyard will gradually break down, disrupt the energy supply \nfrom the Nurek Hydroelectric Power Plant (HEPP), and result in a loss of revenue from energy \nsales. Thus, the secured revenue from future energy generation may be attributed to the Project. \n \n4.  The without-project investment scenario comprises the existing facility of the switchyard \ndeteriorating in 5 years and Barki Tajik replacing it with a new air-insulated switchgear system over \n10 years due to a lack of funds preventing it from being rehabilitated all at once. \n \n5.  Due to the unpredictability of geological events, no analysis has been undertaken with \nregard to landslide and subsidence. However, subsidence prevention costs were included initially \nat $30,000 in 2009, escalating by a factor of $50,000 per annum due to the increased difficulties of \nprevention measures year after year. As the Project will be moved to a different location, the \ninvestment scenario does not include this cost as there is no subsidence. \n \nC.  Tariff Methodology \n6.  The revenue of Nurek HEPP is derived from the share of generation in the cost-covering \ntariff that has been adjusted for losses. Barki Tajik plans to increase the average end-user tariff to \nthe long-run marginal cost level ($0.025/kWh) by 2010. This tariff needs to cover the entire cost of \nenergy supply, including generation, transmission, and distribution. The share of generation in the \nlong-run marginal cost, and thus in the end-user tariff, is approximately 22% (i.e., $0.0055/kWh).2  \n \n7.  Considering that the end-user tariff refers to energy sold, not energy generated, this value \nhas  to  be  further  adjusted.  The  difference  between  energy  generated  and  energy  sold  is \nrepresented by the system and commercial losses. Target system and commercial losses are 10% \nin 2012, but, using a conservative approach, 15% is assumed for this analysis. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Stuttgart. \n ", "46  Appendix 10 \n \n8.  Adjusting the generation tariff by 15% losses results in a tariff of $0.0048/kWh generated. \nThis value is used to calculate the annual revenue of Nurek HEPP, reflecting the financial benefit \nof the Project. \n \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n9.  For estimating the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), it is assumed that the Asian \nDevelopment Bank will finance 81.86% of the Project costs. The Government of Tajikistan would \nonlend the funds with 25 years tenor to Barki Tajik at 5%. The balance will be financed by the \nGovernment. The Government\u2019s contribution has opportunity costs, such as debt repayment or \nalternative investments. The average cost of government funds is calculated by dividing total \ngovernment debt servicing by total government debt; this was 2.6% in 2004. The other assumption \nincludes a domestic annual inflation rate of 5%. The interest rate was adjusted for the corporate tax \nrate (25%), since interest payments are tax deductible.

An analysis was carried out to examine the sensitivity of the FIRR and financial net present \nvalue to adverse changes in such key variables. The scenarios considered for the sensitivity \nanalyses were a 1-year implementation delay, a 50% increase in capital costs, a 100% increase in \noperation and maintenance costs, a 1-year delay in completion, and a 50% decrease in tariffs \n(Table 8.2).
