The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto provide project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for developing renewable energy (RE).  \nA TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan 21\u201330 July 2004 to formulate the proposed TA and \nreached an understanding with GOP on the purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants.1   The TA is included \nin the Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) 2004\u20132006. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan is a net importer of energy.  Each year it spends $3 billion, equivalent to about \n30% of total imports, to import oil to meet its energy needs. Oil importation is a heavy burden on \nGOP\u2019s foreign exchange.  Recent increases in oil prices and their continuous fluctuation further \ncomplicate this problem. Most of the imported energy is for electricity generation.  Over 70% of \nPakistan\u2019s electricity comes from thermal sources, a little less than 30% from hydro, and less \nthan  1%  from  renewable  and  other  sources.  Even  with  all  this imported  energy,  Pakistan \ncurrently faces a 20% power shortage.  Only 55% of Pakistan\u2019s population have access to \nelectricity from the national grid.  The remaining 45% use kerosene, wood, and other bio-fuels \nfor  lighting,  cooking,  and  heating.    In  fact,  Pakistan  has  one  of  the  lowest  per  capita \nconsumption of energy in the world.     \n \n3.  To address the energy shortage and as part of its decentralization policy, GOP has \ndelegated authority to the provinces to develop their own generating capacity of up to 50 \nmegawatts (MW) to meet their energy needs2. Installation of small-scale power generation \ntechnologies located close to the load being served, or distributed generation, has significant \nadvantages.  It will not only help meet the power shortage, but also ensure greater power \nreliability and quality.  \n \n4.  GOP has decided to put greater emphasis on RE. In May 2003, it announced that it had \nset a target of 10% RE, or 2,700 MW, of the country\u2019s energy mix by 20153 and established the \nAlternative Energy Development Board (AEDB) as the apex organization to coordinate RE \npromotion.  To underscore the importance of this initiative, AEDB reports directly to the Prime \nMinister and sits in the Prime Minister\u2019s Secretariat.  Pakistan\u2019s RE potential is substantial and \nthe vast majority of it remains untapped.  Its hydro potential from run-of-the-river micro, mini, \nand small hydro schemes4 from perennial streams, and the extensive irrigation canal system \nhave not yet been fully measured.5  However, this potential has already proven successful both \nin small communities and for connection to the national grid.  Pakistan\u2019s potential for wind has \nnot yet been fully measured, but GOP has installed 50 towers, 30\u2013100 feet high, in the coastal \nareas of Sindh and Balochistan and the desert of Balochistan, to measure wind velocity.  Data \ngathered over the past 2 years indicate that there is adequate wind velocity for setting up wind \nturbines.  The potential for solar energy, although not yet determined, is also thought to be very \ngood. \n                                  \n \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 February 2004. \n2 This ceiling is being reviewed to allow provinces to develop larger generation facilities. \n3 ADB believes that this target is ambitious but achievable, and supports this effort. \n4 Each country has its definitions of hydro size.  For the purpose of this Project micro-hydro refers to units with less \nthan 500 kW, mini-hydros are 500 kW\u20131 MW, and small hydros are 1\u201350 MW.  \n5 It was mentioned (para. 2) that a little less than 30% of Pakistan\u2019s power comes from hydro.  The term refers to \nlarge dams that are not considered to fall under the definition of renewable energy (RE).  RE usually refers to \nsmaller run-of-the-river schemes.  \n ", "2  \n 5.  ADB has given Pakistan assistance on RE through TA 5972: Promoting Renewable \nEnergy, Energy Efficiency, and Greenhouse Gas Abatement (PREGA).6  PREGA consultants \nproduced a substantive report on GOP\u2019s policies on RE, identifying specific incentives and \nbarriers that are currently in place for RE development.  The PREGA consultants are also \ncurrently finalizing two reports.  One will recommend additional policies and incentives that can \nbe implemented to promote RE and the other will recommend steps that need to be taken to \nestablish the necessary structure to take advantage of the clean development mechanism \n(CDM)7 of the Kyoto Protocols to promote further RE development.   \n \n6.  Currently,  there  are  a  few  market-based  and  fiscal  incentives  for  RE,  such  as \naccelerated depreciation for investors and low import duties and taxes for RE technologies \nalready in place in Pakistan.  However, experience around the world indicates that unless equal \nopportunities are made available to conventional energy (mainly thermal power from oil or coal) \nand RE, the establishment of RE will be very difficult and GOP will not be able to meet its goal \nof 10% of its energy mix from RE sources.  For example, there are hidden subsidies on the fuel \ncosts for conventional power generation that allow for lower generation costs.  In addition, costs \nof environmental externalities from pollution have not been included in the pricing of power from \nconventional power generation. AEDB is preparing several additional market-based incentives \nsuch as the introduction of tax holidays, further reducing import duties on a greater range of \ntechnologies, etc. to attract investments in RE and establishment of RE manufacturing facilities \nin Pakistan. AEDB is also working on a pricing structure for RE, based on the costs and benefits \nof RE, that will allow it to compete with generation from conventional energy. The PREGA \nreports, as well as AEDB\u2019s ongoing efforts to introduce market-based and pricing incentives for \nRE, will serve as the basis for policy dialogue with GOP on promoting RE.   \n  \n7.   ADB has also assisted the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA).8  \nNEPRA was created in 1997 and is charged with establishing a regulatory regime that would \nenable and facilitate the transition of the electricity supply industry in Pakistan to commercial \noperation  and,  ultimately,  private  participation  in  ownership.    The  current  structure  for  the \nelectricity market is a Single Buyer Plus model where the National Transmission and Despatch \nCompany (NTDC) buys all energy from the electricity generators and sells the power to the \ndistribution companies.  The model also has provisions that allow distribution companies to \ncontract directly with generators through a direct bilateral contract, with NTDC serving as the \ntransmission company.  The licensing arrangements are already in place to have provincial \ngovernments serving as, what would effectively be, independent power producers or generation \ncompanies selling electricity to NTDC or directly to distribution companies. \n \n8.  The promotion of RE is consistent with ADB's energy policy (2000), which emphasizes \nthe importance of addressing the local, regional and global environmental impacts of ADB\u2019s \nenergy sector interventions in developing member countries (DMCs).  The TA is also consistent \nwith the objectives of the energy sector in the CSPU 2004\u20132006 which, among others, is to \nprovide strategic support for greater use of indigenous energy sources.  ADB has also assisted \n                                  \n \n6 ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Promoting Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Greenhouse Gas \nAbatement.

CDM enables the project owner to sell certified emission reduction \nunits (equivalent to 1 ton of carbon dioxide), to an interested buyer from a developed country. However, Pakistan \nhas not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocols of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \n(UNFCCC) or established the CDM-designated national authority.   \n8 ADB. 2000.

The United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the Global Environment Facility are assisting some small-scale \ncommunity-based windmills.  AEDB has launched a pilot program to electrify 1,000 households \nin each of the provinces with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to raise awareness of the benefits \nfrom electrification from solar PV and to catalyze the sector.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n \n9.  The  TA  will  prepare  a  project  to  develop  indigenous,  nonpolluting,  and  renewable \nsources of energy to help meet Pakistan\u2019s power shortage and improve the quality and reliability \nof the power system, especially in rural areas.  The TA outputs will be the following studies, \nanalyses, and reports: (i) analysis of the RE potential of each province, and (ii) feasibility studies \nof selected sample subprojects for financing under the ensuing loan.  The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have two components.   \n \n(i)  Component 1-Review of renewable energy potential in each province. A \nbroad review of the potential for various RE technologies in each province will be \nconducted to determine the most appropriate (i.e., technically and economically \nviable) sub-projects suitable for funding by the ensuing loan.  The TA will focus \non specific RE technologies in each province: (a) Balochistan: wind, solar, and \nhybrid systems; (b) North-West Frontier Province (NWFP): small hydropower \nfrom perennial high-head rivers that are abundant in the province; (c) Punjab: \nlow-head, high-volume small hydropower stations that can be installed in the \nextensive irrigation canal system in perennial flow in the province; and (d) Sindh: \nsmall hydro, wind, solar, as well as hybrid systems.  It is expected that 30% of \nthe TA resources will be committed to this component. \n \n(ii)  Component 2-Feasibility studies. Based on the reviews, the TA consultants \nwill work with the implementing agencies (IAs) to prioritize subprojects in each \nprovince.   The  subprojects  will  be  selected  by  least-cost  analysis  for  power \nsystem expansion, consistent with ADB\u2019s energy policy (2000), and will include \nanalysis  of  alternatives,  as  well  as  conventional  energy  sources.  The  TA \nconsultants  will  then  conduct  feasibility  studies  for  sample  projects  in  each \nprovince  (about  2  per  province)  to  be  financed  by  the  ensuing  loan.  The \nfeasibility studies will include technical, economic, financial,9 environmental, and \nsocial analyses.  The ensuing loan is expected to be a sector loan.  As such, the \nfeasibility studies will develop model technical, economic, and financial analyses \nthat can be used by the executing agencies (EAs) in selecting subprojects for \nloan financing as well as framework for environmental and social assessments. It \nis expected that 70% the TA resources will be committed to this component.   \n                                  \n \n9 ADB has a CDM facility.  The executing agencies (EAs) may want to request assistance from the ADB CDM facility \nto explore the possibility of developing the CDM components of the subprojects to generate an additional income \nstream.  However, Pakistan has not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocols. \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the proposed TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent, comprising about \n$380,000 in foreign exchange cost and about $420,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB \nwill provide $550,000, comprising $380,000 in foreign exchange cost and $170,000 equivalent \nin local currency cost on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government \nof Japan.  The Government will contribute the remaining $250,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs in kind.  The cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  The Government has been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing ensuing projects.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  AEDB  will  be  the  EA  for  the  TA.    Its  role  will  be  to  facilitate  TA  implementation, \ncoordinate its activities, and disseminate the information learned.  The TA will be implemented \nat the provincial level.  The IAs will be the Department of Irrigation and Power of each province.  \nThe departments will work closely with the TA consultants and will provide them with the \nnecessary information and guidance in carrying out the studies.  A project manager of senior \nstanding  in  the  IA  will  be  appointed  by  the  IAs,  and  a  project  management  unit  (PMU), \nconsisting of two or three engineers, will be established in each province to oversee the day-to-\nday activities and work with the project consultants.  The project manager will be appointed and \nPMU established before the TA begins.   \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented in four phases:  phase 1, inception phase; phase 2, review \nof the potential for various RE technologies in each province as outlined in component 1; phase \n3, conducting required studies and analyses as outlined in component 2; and phase 4, finalizing \nthe feasibility studies and reports.   The consultants will submit the following reports: (i) an \ninception report to be submitted 1 month after project start-up, providing a detailed work plan for \nimplementing the TA; (ii) an interim report after completion of phase 2, with the review of the \npotential for various RE technologies in each province; (iii) an interim report after completion of \nphase 3, with the findings of the required studies, analyses, models, and reports; and (iv) a final \nreport that meets the requirements of ADB\u2019s sector loan modality.  All major draft reports will be \ncirculated to the IAs, ADB, and relevant stakeholders. All project reports will be drafted in a \nmanner  consistent  with  documentation  needed  for  processing  an  ADB  sector  loan.  The \nconsultants will then organize a consultation or tripartite meeting of representatives from the \nIAs, AEDB, ADB, and relevant stakeholders, including concerned ministries, departments, and \nagencies  of  the  federal  and  provincial  governments,  nongovernment  organizations,  private \nentrepreneurs, external funding agencies, etc.  The meetings will be held in Pakistan, 1 week \nafter circulation of the draft reports to discuss the findings. The team leader will submit a final \nreport within 1 month of the final consultation or tripartite meeting, incorporating comments \nduring the meetings. \n \n14.  The TA will begin in January 2005. It will be carried out over 8 months and will be \ncompleted by 30 September 2005.  The TA will require 14 person-months of international and \n32 person-months of domestic consulting services.  The consultants will have prior experience \nin preparing an ADB sector loan and be familiar with ADB\u2019s respective guidelines for technical, \nfinancial, and economic analyses, as well as environmental and social safeguards. The outline \nterms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3.  Consultants will be selected in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging of domestic consultants.  The consultants will be required to \nsubmit simplified technical proposals and will be selected using the quality- and cost-based \n   ", "                        5\n                     \nmethod.
