I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Republic of Palau for the COVID-19 Response for Affected Poor and Vulnerable Groups \nProject. The report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and a grant to be provided by the Ireland Trust Fund \nfor Building Climate Change and Disaster Resilience in Small Island Developing States (Ireland \nTrust Fund) and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the administration of each of these grants. \n \n2.  The project aims to address the needs of poor and vulnerable groups affected by the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19). All outputs are aligned with the outcome of improving the \ncapability of vulnerable groups to withstand the impacts of COVID-19 by providing immediate \nassistance to these groups while positioning them to achieve higher levels of economic and social \nwell-being post-COVID-19. The project will (i) implement welfare support to highly at-risk older \npeople and persons with disabilities (PWD), (ii) deliver food security and income-generating \nsupport to small agricultural producers, and (iii) implement multidisciplinary responses to address \nfamily violence and gender-based violence (GBV). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Although  Palau  has  only  2  confirmed  COVID-19  cases,  the  pandemic  has  had  a \ndevastating impact on its tourism-dependent economy.1 The estimated population of Palau is at \n17,934 in 2020.2 An extended border closure began in March 2020 and has brought tourism to a \nstandstill, resulting in the loss of more than 3,200 jobs, or nearly 30% of formal employment for \nboth local and foreign workers. An estimated 1,200 of these lost jobs were held by women.3 Real \nper capita household incomes are projected to fall by 22.6% as a result of COVID-19, which could \nincrease the basic needs poverty rate from 19.4% in 2014 to 27.9% in FY2021.4 Although the \ngovernment  took  prompt  action  and  was  able  to  attenuate  severe  hardship  through  its \nCoronavirus Relief One Stop Shop (CROSS) Act, persons with pre-existing vulnerabilities are \nbeing disproportionately impacted by the economic impacts of COVID-19. These groups include \nolder people and PWD, the poor, small agricultural producers, and survivors of family violence \nand GBV. \n \n4.  Heightened  vulnerability  among  marginalized  groups.  Older  people  and  PWD, \nparticularly those with pre-existing conditions, experience heightened vulnerability because of \nCOVID-19  mobility  restrictions  and  their  dependency  on  caregivers.  The  homebound  are \nparticularly vulnerable to serious illness or death in the event of a COVID-19 outbreak in Palau \nbecause of their age and chronic health conditions. Many older people and PWD also depend on \ntheir extended families for financial support, which has been adversely impacted by reduced \n \n1   Confirmed cases as of 14 June 2021. These cases are travel related and classified as historical cases from previous \ninfection outside of Palau. There is still no local transmission of COVID-19. Palau Ministry of Health.

With real per capita incomes increasing by a cumulative 11.4% between \n2006 and 2014, the growth elasticity of poverty in Palau is estimated to be about \u20131.9. The projected 22.6% fall in \nreal per capita incomes can therefore translate to a 43.8% increase in the basic needs poverty rate. \n ", "2 \nhousehold earnings triggered by the pandemic. There are an estimated 2,288 senior citizens in \nPalau, representing 13% of the total population, and this proportion is projected to increase \nsubstantially  in  the  future.5  Approximately  200  older  people  and  PWD  are  registered  as \nhomebound in the country.6 Although 75% of older people are either employed or receive social \nsecurity, many early retirees receive only modest payments.7 Of households headed by senior \ncitizens, the share who live below the basic needs poverty line is 16.2% in urban areas and 19.5% \nin rural areas.8 The share of households headed by senior citizens without an income is highest \nin rural Babeldaob (54%), followed by Koror-Airai urban (27%) and outlying states (19%).9 \nGovernment services such as midday meals for senior citizens are only available in the Koror-\nAirai region and reach only about 2% of the eligible population (footnote 9). \n \n5.  Adverse  economic  impacts  affecting  poor  and  smallholder  producers.  Palau\u2019s \neconomy is dominated by the formal wage and salary sector, which employs 83% of the labor \nforce and generates 65% of household income.10 Despite the dominance of the formal sector, \nsmall-scale production of agricultural and marine products is a source of income for one-third of \nhouseholds (footnote 8). Rural households are 50% more likely to live in poverty than urban \nhouseholds. Because of rising sea levels, saltwater inundation is also a serious problem for \nfarmers in low-lying areas. About 25% of rural households have reported significant impacts from \nthe COVID-19 economic slowdown; and 70% of impacted households have been primarily \naffected by reduced market sales.11 Because most small producers are unregistered, many lack \nrecords to document their losses and, hence, have experienced difficulty qualifying for temporary \nunemployment benefits. About 3,364 persons have received full or partial unemployment benefits \nunder one of the three COVID-19 temporary assistance programs: the United States federal \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security programs; CROSS temporary employment; and \nCROSS unemployment assistance. Of this number, only about 1.5% are small producers and \n9.2% are market vendors.12 \n \n6.  Risk of increased domestic and gender-based violence. Estimates of GBV in Palau \nshow that, out of a population of 6,503 women, (i) 520 experience domestic violence perpetuated \nby an intimate partner in their lifetime, (ii) 384 experience violence perpetuated by a non-partner \nin their lifetime, and (iii) more than 900 are impacted by violence each year.13 On average, \n \n5  Palau Red Cross Society. 2020.

Belau Family Health Survey. Koror; MHHS, Government of Australia, Department \nof Foreign Affairs and Trade, and United Nations Population Fund. According to this survey, one-quarter of women \nin Palau (25.2%) have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner in their lifetime. More than 8% \nexperienced such violence in the 12 months prior to the interview, and slightly more than 15% of women in Palau \nhave experienced sexual violence by a non-partner since the age of 15 in their lifetime. In 2015, there were estimated \n6,503 women over the age of 15 residing in Palau. \n ", "3 \nhowever, only 90 cases of domestic violence are reported to the police or judicial authorities each \nyear.14 This indicates that, prior to COVID-19, there was already a significant unmet need for \nsupport. Since COVID-19, there have been anecdotal reports of increased domestic violence, \nand the number of cases reported to the police rose by more than 200% from March 2020 to July \n2020. In 2012, Palau enacted the Family Protection Act (FPA), which seeks to address all forms \nof family violence, and to create a seamless system of response from law enforcement and the \njudiciary, health, and social sectors. However, a review of FPA implementation in 2017 identified \nservice gaps in case management, counseling, access to temporary housing, and prevention.15 \nThe highest priority gap in the FPA implementation plan is a lack of holistic case management \nsupport for family and GBV survivors. \n \n7.  Limited social protection programs. The social protection sector in Palau primarily \ncomprises social insurance, which only provides direct benefits to those in formal employment.16 \nIn  2015, the  government\u2019s formal social  assistance  expenditures  were  only  0.7%  of  gross \ndomestic product with limited assistance for older people, PWD, and children with special needs \n(footnote 16). As a result, the social protection sector was poorly positioned to respond sufficiently \nto the impacts of COVID-19 on vulnerable groups. Finding ways to further strengthen and expand \nexisting social protection programs in Palau is critical to respond immediately to vulnerable groups \nduring a pandemic and develop a more adaptive social protection system for the future. \n \n8.  Alignment with  government  strategies. The  project  will  support the government\u2019s \ncomprehensive COVID-19 response strategy by expanding social assistance to mitigate the \nshort-term economic impacts of COVID-19 while building the resilience of beneficiaries against \nfuture shocks. The project is aligned with Palau\u2019s medium- and long-term poverty reduction \nstrategies. The Palau 2020 National Master Development Plan targets increased economic \ngrowth per capita on a sustainable basis, and shared the benefits of economic growth equitably.17 \nFurther, the latest medium-term development strategy\u2014Actions for Palau\u2019s Future\u2014includes a \nvision of \u201clife with dignity.\u201d18 Specific goals include (i) ensuring that the basic needs of all of Palau\u2019s \nresidents are met; (ii) reducing vulnerability by preserving safety nets represented by the Palauan \nethic of sharing and caring, and universal access to productive land and sea resources; and (iii) \nproviding compassionate and timely assistance to people who fall through the safety nets. \n \n9.  Lessons  and  alignment  with  ADB  strategy.  The  project  is  included  in  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) country operations business plan and is fully aligned with the Pacific \nApproach which focuses on addressing vulnerability to external shocks.19 The project is also \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing  inequalities;  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality;  (iii)  promoting  rural \ndevelopment and food security; and (iv) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability.20  The  project  design  integrates  key \nlessons from ADB\u2019s response to the COVID-19 crisis, such as the need to ensure ownership and \n \n14 Government of Palau, Bureau of Budget and Planning, Office of Planning and Statistics. 2019.

Project Description \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: adverse impacts of COVID-19 on poor \nand vulnerable groups are mitigated, and the social and economic resilience of these groups is \nstrengthened. The project will have the following outcome: capabilities of poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds to withstand further impacts of COVID-19 improved.22 The project is estimated to have \n1,650 direct beneficiaries, an estimated additional 1,400 frontline workers who will be trained on \nGBV referral pathways, and at least 12,000 people to be covered by a GBV prevention campaign. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Welfare  support  for  highly  at-risk  older  people  and  persons  with \ndisabilities implemented. This output will respond to the immediate physical, mental, social, and \nenvironmental needs of low-income, homebound older people and PWD. It will provide assistance \nthrough (i) gender-responsive case management that facilitates access to the full range of \nservices available in the community such as health care, social programs, and legal and family \nprotection;23 (ii) community-based wellness promotion to enhance social well-being and alleviate \nloneliness among older people and PWD; (iii) training for family and community caregivers on \ncare and support for vulnerable people and PWD;24 (iv) help in developing home gardens by \nproviding family caregivers with seedlings, planting materials, and know-how to cultivate and use \nproduce to meet nutritional needs; and (v) support for home improvements and adaptations to \nensure healthy, safe, and accessible living conditions. The output will help the government deliver \nmore effective social protection services to older people and PWD through holistic support that \nstrengthens the capacity of individuals, their families, and their caregivers to address a range of \nfactors that undermine quality of life, while encouraging deeper collaboration with community-\nbased organizations and volunteers to strengthen existing social protection services. This output \nis also envisaged to contribute to amending the Health Care Fund to include paying community-\nbased caregivers. Beneficiaries will be prioritized based on functional capacity (with bedridden \npersons or those with limited mobility); income status (no income, income below the national \npoverty line, or decreased household income because of COVID-19), and urgency of their care \nneeds.25 \n \n12.  Output  2:  Food  security  and  income-generating  support  delivered  to  small \nagricultural producers. The Palau Visitors Authority (PVA) and Bureau of Agriculture (BOA), \nworking closely with partners,26 will support small agriculture producers to increase production \nand augment earnings while reducing vulnerability to climate change, particularly sea level rise, \nby promoting upland taro production.27 Activities under the output are (i) the promotion of food \n \n21 ADB. 2020. Responding to the Novel Coronavirus Crisis: 13 Lessons from Evaluation. Manila. \n22 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n23 Case management typically involves (i) needs assessment; (ii) service planning in consultation with the client, family, \nand care providers; (iii) coordinating services; (iv) advocacy; (v) monitoring; and (vi) other services, such as \ncounseling as appropriate. Older people, PWD, and survivors of GBV will also benefit from output 3 support. \n24 Training will cover the practicalities of caring for older people and PWD with reduced mobility (e.g., feeding, bathing, \nand lifting); physical health including nutrition and exercise; and psychosocial health. \n25 The MHHS will undertake a pre-project baseline assessment of homebound older people and PWD. \n26 Key partners include Palau Community College, the Airai State Government, the Small Business Development \nCenter, the Embassy of Japan, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and Taipei,China\u2019s technical mission in \nPalau. The BOA and PVA will draft a memorandum of agreement for partner contributions. \n27 The PVA is a semiautonomous body established as a public corporation to promote the development of a visitor \nindustry under the Tourism Reorganization Act of 1982 (Palau Public Law 1\u201349). \n ", "5 \nsecurity and strengthened production support for upland and taro farmers through the provision \nof cultured  seedlings  to farmers;28  (ii)  the  provision  of seed  grants,  extension support  and \nbusiness support training for selected women\u2019s farming cooperatives to expand to dryland taro \nproduction and to encourage them to adopt improved business management practices; (iii) the \nestablishment of an agriculture support center, comprising a plant distribution nursery and food \nprocessing facility; and (iv) through the food processing facility, the provision of a guaranteed \nmarket for purchasing raw agriculture products from small agriculture producers. The center will \nnot only sustain project interventions but help add value by facilitating the production of new \nproducts, including taro chips, ice cream, and taro flour.29 Sales of processed food products will \nlink with existing retail outlets, restaurants, and caterers. New value-added products developed \nthrough the food processing center will not only serve the domestic market but also promote 100% \nPalau-sourced goods in the tourism market.30 This is envisaged to promote community\u2013tourism \nlinkages in the medium- to long-term. The output will focus on small agriculture women producers \non the island of Babeldaob.31 Key selection criteria for women\u2019s farming cooperatives include at \nleast 25% of its members are low-income, significantly impacted by the COVID-19 economic \nslowdown, or single-parent households; or it has proposed a plan to leverage seed grant funds to \nserve  low-income  or  single-parent  households  in  their  community.  The  women\u2019s  farming \ncooperatives  will  enter  into  a  memorandum  of  agreement  with the  Ministry  of  Agriculture, \nFisheries and Environment through the BOA on the use of seed grants.32 \n \n13.  Output 3: Multidisciplinary responses to address family and gender-based violence \nimplemented. This output will address two priority gaps in the current response to family and \nGBV, which are at risk of being aggravated by the pandemic: (i) a lack of integrated case \nmanagement support to help survivors navigate the legal, health, and social service systems; and \n(ii) a lack of sustained prevention-oriented communications. The project will address these gaps \nby (i) delivering integrated case management support for survivors, including a free 24-hour \nhotline, crisis counseling, and multisectoral referral pathways;33 and (ii) implementing a social \nmarketing campaign that both informs key service providers of available services and referral \npathways, and helps change community social norms on GBV. The project will help ensure that \nsurvivors of family and GBV, especially during the pandemic, receive high-quality, culturally \nsensitive,  non-judgmental  services in  a manner that fosters self-respect  and  independence \nthrough the involvement of nongovernment organizations (NGOs).

It is grown in all of Palau\u2019s states, with Babeldaob as the primary center of production. \nBabeldaob has about 30% of the country\u2019s population or 6,000 people living on it and representing an estimated 70% \nof all the taro producers in the country. Taro production can only be significantly expanded through expanding dryland \ncultivation. Therefore, the project focuses on taro and upland farmers in increasing production. Palau Community \nCollege\u2019s Cooperative and Research Extension Services will produce tissue-cultured seedlings. \n29 While the output itself will focus on taro products, the equipment and technical expertise delivered through the \nprocessing center can support a range of products. For example, the equipment used to produce taro chips can also \nbe used to make chips from other root crops and vegetables. The project will conduct a market trial and develop a \nproduction-to-market plan to bring new products to market and to explore ways for the private sector to be involved. \n30  Palau has already opened its borders to travelers who are fully vaccinated. As of 14 June 2021, 73% of population   \nor 96% of adults have been fully vaccinated.  \n31 Women are the primary agricultural producers and farm managers in Palau. Women normally carry out agricultural \nactivities together in cooperatives, rotating their work to provide labor for their members.  Further economic analysis \nwill be undertaken during implementation to feed into the monitoring and evaluation of the project\u2019s support to \nadditional income generation of women beneficiaries. The targeted women groups will also receive information about \nGBV referral pathways under Output 3.  \n32 Further details are in Concept Note for Outputs 1 and 2 in Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n33 Survivors of family violence and GBV who need assistance in becoming economically independent may be eligible \nto benefit further from training opportunities under outputs 1 and 2. \n ", "6 \nservices,  the  number  of  cases  reported  to  authorities  is  expected  to  increase.  The  social \nmarketing campaign will support help-seeking behavior and prevent domestic violence. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n14.  The rapid assessment of COVID-19 impacts on vulnerable groups, through ADB\u2019s regional \ntechnical assistance for Strengthening Social Protection in the Pacific, helped inform the project \nscope.34 The project seeks to add value by (i) providing integrated COVID-19 responses that \ntarget vulnerable groups and complement other ADB support in the country, including the COVID-\n19  Pandemic  Response  Option  and  emergency  support  through  the Asia  Pacific  Disaster \nResponse Fund;35 (ii) addressing immediate needs and existing gaps in COVID-19 responses, \nwhile positioning beneficiaries to achieve higher levels of economic, health, and social well-being; \n(iii) not only assisting direct beneficiaries, but also building the capacity of their support groups \nincluding  family  members  and  communities;  and  (iv)  building  on  existing  social  protection \nprograms and other services to expand them to vulnerable groups, including taro farmers whose \nlivelihoods are being threatened by sea level rise. The project also includes gender-transformative \nfeatures  to  build  women\u2019s  resilience  to  similar  shocks.  Lessons  from  the  project  will  be \ndisseminated though knowledge products and regional Pacific events to be facilitated by ADB\u2019s \nregional technical assistance for Strengthening Social Protection in the Pacific (footnote 34). \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $3.77 million (Table 1). \n \n16.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).36 The project will finance expenditures related to civil works, \ngoods, consulting services, trainings, seed grants, and project management. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n  Amounta  Share of Total \nItem  ($)  (%) \nA.

The government has requested a grant not exceeding $0.77 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources Asian Development Fund (ADF) 13 thematic pool to help finance the project. \nThe JFPR will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $2.4 million, and the Ireland Trust Fund will \nprovide grant cofinancing equivalent to $0.55 million; ADB will fully administer both. The summary \nfinancing  plan  is  in  Table  2. The  JFPR  will  finance subcomponents  of  output  1  related  to \ncommunity-based wellness promotion activities and minor and small-scale home improvements; \nand all subcomponents of output 2. The Ireland Trust Fund will finance other subcomponents of \noutput 1 such as case management, training for family and community caregivers, and home \ngardens to meet the nutritional needs of older people and PWD. The ADF 13 thematic pool will \nfinance specific components supporting the Sustainable Development Goal 5 transformative \ngender agenda, such as addressing family violence and GBV. This will ensure an immediate \nresponse during the pandemic and pave the way for a longer-term approach to address violence \nagainst women and girls. The funding will also facilitate a more targeted COVID-19 response for \nwomen and girls by funding a gender expert to execute the project\u2019s gender components, \nincluding the gender-transformative activities, across all outputs. These would not have been \npossible without some critical grants from the ADF 13 thematic pool, given the government\u2019s \ncompeting priorities during the pandemic. The integration of both livelihood support and GBV \nprevention will strengthen women\u2019s capacity to cope with crisis and shocks, especially given the \nproject\u2019s focus on small agricultural women producers. The project will serve as a case study for \nthis kind of targeted and mutually reinforcing assistance for possible replication in other Pacific \ndeveloping member countries. \n \n18.  All project expenditures are eligible for funding under the funding sources. The project \ngrant modality is deemed appropriate since this is a stand-alone project to assist poor and \nvulnerable  groups  affected  by  COVID-19.  Public  sector  financing is critical,  given that the \neconomic and health threats from the crisis affect both the public and private sectors. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of tax exemptions, counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions through staff time. \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nAsian Development Fund 13 Thematic Pool  766,442  20.4 \nIreland Trust Fund for Building Climate Change and Disaster  550,000  14.6 \nResilience in Small Island Developing Statesa     \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reductiona  2,400,000  63.7 \nGovernment of Palaub  49,759  1.3 \nTotal  3,766,201  100.0 \na  Administered by the Asian Development Bank. \nb  Includes exemptions from government taxes and duties. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.  Food security investments are estimated to cost $1.28 million under JFPR funding. These \ninvestments will help increase taro production in Palau and promote agriculture value addition \nthrough food processing, which will benefit small agricultural producers. \n \n20.  While  the  project  has  no  activities  expected  to  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions \nsignificantly, the agricultural activities under output 2 will result in increased resilience in the \nproduction of taro. It is estimated that at least 78.5% of the costs of output 2 will support climate \nchange adaptation. \n \n ", "8 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the \nPAM (footnote 36). Strategic procurement planning was used to develop an overall procurement \nstrategy and prepare the project procurement plan. NGOs will help implement outputs 1 and 3. \nProcurement and consultant recruitment will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and its associated procurement regulations and guidance notes. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  August 2021\u2013August 2024 \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2024 \nEstimated grant completion date  28 February 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Project steering committee  Chair: Minister of Finance \nCo-chair: Minister of the MHHS \nMembers: Minister of the MAFE, chair of the PVA board of \ndirectors, and chair of the Palau Association of Governors \nObservers: ADB Palau country office, Embassy of Japan in Palau, \nand JICA Palau country office \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance, Palau \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  MHHS through the Bureau of Public Health (outputs 1 and 3) \nPVA and BOA (output 2) \n(iv) Implementation unit  Location within the MHHS \nProcurement  Direct contracting  1 contract  $776,000 \nRFQ (works)  2 contracts  $100,000  \nRFQ (goods)  4 contracts  $271,000 \nConsulting services  CQS  130 person-months  $650,000 \nLCS  1 contract  $21,000 \nICS  220 person-months  $885,000 \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting for consulting and non-consulting services. \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds of the JFPR, the Ireland Trust Fund, and ADB \nwill be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed between the Government of Palau and ADB.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank; BOA = Bureau of Agriculture; CQS = consultants\u2019 qualification selection; ICS = \nindividual consultant selection; JFPR = Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction; JICA = Japan International Cooperation \nAgency; LCS = least-cost selection; MAFE = Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment; MHHS = Ministry of \nHealth and Human Services; PVA = Palau Visitors Authority; RFQ = request for quotations. \nSource: ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  While the family and clan systems in Palau remain strong, they are slowly being eroded \nby social change. The project incorporates several innovations to help respond to gaps in social \nprotection systems. Output 1 focuses on seamless, holistic services that consider the overall \nhealth and well-being of homebound older people and PWD. Qualitative data collection, including \nthe use of photovoice techniques, will document baseline conditions and make it possible to track \n ", "9 \nproject impacts across the life of the project.37 Output 2 will implement a novel approach for \naddressing  a  nexus  of  development  issues  in  agriculture,  food  security,  and tourism,  with \nparticular benefits for smallholder women producers affected by the pandemic. Output 3 will \nstrengthen  the  implementation  of  Palau\u2019s  FPA  by  piloting  integrated  \u201cwrap-around\u201d  case \nmanagement services delivered through an NGO.38 Research suggests that survivors are more \ncomfortable seeking help outside the government sector, and that an NGO will be more flexible \nthan a government office in responding to client needs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n23.  A qualitative assessment indicates that the project activities will significantly benefit the \npoor and vulnerable in Palau.39 Output 1 is expected to improve beneficiaries\u2019 physical and mental \nhealth and social well-being by (i) reducing the risk of illness and feelings of isolation, (ii) providing \naccess to nutritious food, and (iii) providing a form of community wellness check to ensure the \ncontinued good health of vulnerable residents. Output 2 will help boost local food security and \ngenerate income. It will also generate incomes for smallholder producers from guaranteed sales \nof their produce at fair market prices to the food processing center, and promote the integration \nof healthy local produce into household diets and restaurant menus. The nursery and food \nprocessing center will also provide opportunities for internships and placements for female \nstudents to support entry into more skilled work. Output 3 is expected to help reduce the severity \nand incidence of family violence and GBV through improved case management and increased \npublic awareness. Improved response and referral mechanisms will also help facilitate survivors\u2019 \nrecovery from trauma and allow them to develop practical life skills to live independently. All \nproject outputs were assessed for financial sustainability rather than financial viability. Outputs 1 \nand 3, and the plant nursery under output 2 will generate no revenue, while the objective for the \nfood processing facility under output 2 is cost recovery rather than profit.40 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n24.  Output 1 will expand the MHHS\u2019s social assistance to older people and PWD. The project\u2019s \nholistic approach will provide inputs to the policy on aging as mandated by Public Law 10-51, \nNational Policy on Care for the Aging (enacted in February 2020). Under output 1, the project will \nalso help develop partnerships between state governments and community-based organizations \nto support the continuity of services after the end of the project. In the medium term, the \ngovernment is expected to amend the Health Care Fund to include paying community-based \ncaregivers assisting certified recipients.41 The plant nursery under output 2 is expected to be \nfinancially sustainable because of ongoing government support: the BOA will manage the nursery \nand has indicated its commitment to continue providing support beyond project completion since \nthe nursery is already part of its programs, in line with its mandate to develop the agriculture \n \n37 Photovoice uses photographs and/or videographs (with the permission of the person) to record the living situation of \nseniors and their abilities (including cognition and mobility). These photographs are then interpreted by local experts \nto identify environmental and caregiving deficiencies requiring intervention, as well as any changes identified from \nphotos taken over time. \n38 The MHHS is using \u201cwrap-around\u201d case management, a client-centered approach pioneered in the substance abuse \nfield, for a wide range of mental and behavioral health services. Under this approach, the case manager helps \nformulate an individualized support team for the client consisting of professionals, family members, friends, and/or \ncommunity leaders. \n39 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n40 ADB. 2009.

The \ngovernment will also work closely with other development partners such as the World Health Organization in \nstrengthening aged care. \n ", "10 \nsector  in  Palau.  The  food  processing center  under  output  2 is  also  seen  to  be  financially \nsustainable. Preliminary estimates suggest that sales revenues will be sufficient to offset costs of \nproduction,  facility  operation  and  maintenance  (including  staff),  and  minor  equipment \nreplacement. Palau\u2019s tourism sector is expected to recover in 2022; this is expected to help boost \nsales,  together  with  market  research  and  planning  efforts  to  diversify  product  offerings.  If \nsubsidies are needed before the food processing center becomes financially self-sustaining, the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) has indicated that the government will provide support as needed. \nOutput 3 provides an alternative model for delivering services to survivors of family violence and \nGBV through wrap-around case management, and will leverage social marketing to de-normalize \nfamily violence and GBV. If successful, the MHHS will seek resources under the FPA to continue \nintervention when grant funding ends. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n25.  The pre-mitigation financial management risk assessment for the MOF is low. The MOF \nhas a fully functioning financial management structure that manages the government\u2019s financial \naspects and has experience implementing donor-funded projects, including those financed by \nADB. The pre-mitigation financial management risk for the implementing agencies is substantial. \nKey financial management risks include low capacity in financial management systems, the \nabsence of an internal audit function, and a lack of familiarity with ADB disbursement procedures \nand reporting requirements. As the implementing agencies operate on budgetary allocations, they \nmerely monitor their expenditures against the budget provided. The MOF and implementing \nagencies will implement an action plan as key measures to address these deficiencies (Table 4). \n \n26.  The MOF and implementing agencies have sufficient procurement experience under \nnational  law,  including  the  evaluation  of  technical  proposals  and  monitoring  of  contract \nperformance.  However,  since  they  lack  experience  with  multilateral  development  bank \nprocurement procedures, the procurement risk is assessed as medium. A procurement specialist \nwill be recruited under the project management unit to help with procurement and contract \nmanagement in accordance with ADB regulations. ADB will provide training and intermittent \nmentoring to the project management unit on procurement guidelines and procedures. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \nimplementing agencies and MOF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 36). ADB conducted integrity due diligence on the PVA and \nthe members of its board of directors and key management.42 They do not appear to constitute \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risk. ADB has obtained reasonable assurance that the \nPVA was not established and is not being used for money laundering or terrorism financing in the \nproject jurisdiction. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n27.  Nearly one in five seniors live below the national poverty line, 15% live with a disability, \nand 75% live with one or more chronic health conditions.43 Welfare assistance for older people \nand PWD will not only address their existing needs but also prevent the causes of rapidly \n \n42 ADB. 2003.

Loss  of \nhousehold income because of COVID-19 puts vulnerable groups, especially poor households and \nsmallholder producers, at risk of falling deeper into poverty.44 The food security and income-\ngenerating component will provide immediate support to these groups, while helping them build \neconomic resilience to withstand further shocks. The project is categorized as gender equity \ntheme. Gender elements under output 1 include expanding and strengthening social assistance \nfor 150 homebound older people and PWD (55% women); developing gender-responsive case \nmanagement guidelines and standard operating procedures; and training caregivers on gender-\nresponsive guidelines. Gender activities under output 2 include benefitting at least 1,200 farmers \n(60% women) through increased access to taro seedlings; supporting at least 300 women farmers \nto increase production and income; and providing internships enabling women students to gain \ntechnical agricultural skills. Output 3 includes such activities as developing and rolling out family \nand GBV case management services, training on services and referral pathways for frontline \nworkers and women\u2019s organizations, and a national social marketing campaign. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.45 \n \n29.  Environment. The project is category C for environmental safeguards. Outputs 1 and 3 \ninvolve no civil works. Output 2 involves minor renovations to existing structures to house the \nnursery at the BOA center in Nekken and to house the agriculture support center comprising the \nfood processing facility and plant distribution nursery. Renovation works will be limited to existing \nstructures and will not involve any earthmoving activities. State building permits will be required \nand will be issued after the nominated contractor prepares a basic construction environmental \nmanagement plan as stipulated in the project\u2019s grant agreement. While there may be small-scale \nsecondary processing during project operation, such activity will not be on an industrial scale, with \nthe project using basic and simple machines. Thus, the waste stream will be insignificant and \nadequately handled through the local municipal authority. Overall, the project will result in low or \nminimal environmental impacts and will not pose any significant environmental risks. \n \n30.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  category  C  for \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. No involuntary resettlement or land acquisition \nwill result from the project. The plant nursery will be at an existing BOA facility in Nekken, and the \nprocessing center will be at an existing building owned by the Airai State Government. The project \nwill not impact any indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n31.  Overall, the project is low risk because (i) the MOF is experienced in executing ADB grants \nand loans; (ii) the procurement of goods and services will not be complex, and adequate providers \nhave been pre-identified; (iii) no safeguard concerns exist; and (iv) the project activities involve \nthe modification and expansion of existing practices. Significant financial management risks \nidentified and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.  \n \n \n44 Further information on poverty and COVID-19 impacts on vulnerable groups are discussed in paras. 4\u20136. \n45 ADB.
