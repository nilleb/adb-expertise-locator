INTRODUCTION\n1. In February 1999,1 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved financing of $700,000\nfor a long-term regional training program for members of the South Pacific Association of\nSupreme Audit Institutions (SPASAI).2 The training program, which is being implemented in two\nphases, assists SPASAI and its member supreme audit institutions (SAIs) in strengthening their\nauditing as well as their audit-training capabilities to enable them to assume responsibility for\ndeveloping, delivering, and managing regional and local training programs that would meet their\nspecific audit requirements. This responsibility currently rests with the International Organization\nof Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) Development Initiative (IDI).3 Phase I, under TA 5830\n(footnote 1), focused on setting up the regional training mechanism and enhancing the training\nskills,  while  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Phase  II  will  focus  on  testing  the  training\nmechanism and strengthening the audit skills. The TA is included in the 2000 Regional TA\nProgram and was endorsed by the Regional TA Screening Committee on 3 December 1999.4\nThe TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The SAIs, being the highest level of audit body in government, are responsible for\nauditing government income and expenditures. As  such,  the  SAIs act as  watchdogs over\nfinancial integrity and credibility of reported information. They can play a key role in promoting\ngood governance, as they are essential elements of accountability and transparency in the\npublic sector. To respond to the increasing need to be efficient and effective in performing their\naudit  function,  the  skills  of  the  SAI  auditors  require  continuous  upgrading.  The  long-term\nregional  training  program  is  intended  to  create  a  pool  of  regional  course  designers  and\ninstructors to meet audit training requirements in the South Pacific. Specifically, the program will\ncover 13 SPASAI members, all of which are ADB  member  countries,  with 12 being from\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs), namely, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall\nIslands, Federal States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands,\nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.\n3. Phase  I  produced  17  graduates  from  the  intensive  43-day  course  design  and\ndevelopment  workshop  (CDDW)  and  the  20-day  instructor  training  workshop  (ITW).  The\ngraduates designed and developed course materials on a number of audit subjects, namely, an\neight-day  course  on  audit  programming  and  documentation,  and  15  two-day  courses  on\ninvestigating fraud and irregularities, analytical review, assessing risk, and interviewing skills. A\nseparate two-day course on accounting and auditing for ADB projects was designed by IDI.\nSince the participating SAI auditors are also required to conduct these training courses at their\nrespective SAIs, the course materials include a detailed instructor manual to facilitate adoption\nof the courses at the local levels. Because the course on audit programming and documentation\nis to be delivered in Phase II, the course materials were finalized by selected CDDW/ITW\n                                               \n1  TA 5830-REG: Long-Term Regional Training Program for Members of the South Pacific Association of Supreme\nAudit Institutions, for $700,000, approved on 3 February 1999. The TA is expected to be completed by the second\nquarter of 2000.\n2  SPASAI, established in November 1988, is one of the regional working groups of the International Organization of\nSupreme Audit Institutions. It encourages, promotes, and advances better audit practices among its members in\nthe South Pacific.\n3  IDI is the training arm of INTOSAI. It was established in 1986 to foster the advancement of public accounting and\nauditing, especially in developing nations, through information exchange and training for audit practitioners and\ntrainers from SAIs.\n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 2000.", "2\ngraduates in a separate 10-day review and planning meeting during Phase I. Their work took\ninto account the lessons learned from the pilot test conducted as part of the ITW.\n4. The underlying principle of the training program is to offer practical training to auditors\nwho will then train other auditors of member SAIs. Phase II is intended to test the training skills\nand reinforce the learnings of the Phase I graduates by actually delivering a technical audit\ncourse to a regional audience. Phase II will produce a pool of experienced regional audit\ntraining specialists, making it possible for SPASAI to continue the task of developing, delivering,\nand managing regional training programs. Furthermore, all participants are required, initially\nusing the course materials developed in Phase I, to organize local training courses at their\nrespective SAIs to be able to subsequently train more staff auditors at the grassroots level.\n5. To enhance the sustainability of the program and ensure the continuing enhancement of\naudit skills in the South Pacific, a regional planning workshop to be attended by the heads of the\nSAIs in the South Pacific is also scheduled in Phase II. This will enable them to formulate\ndefinite plans for the regional and local training programs using the graduates of the training\nprogram. The pool of regional and local audit training specialists, if maintained and enhanced,\nwill benefit SPASAI, member SAIs, DMCs, and ADB. These training specialists, who possess\nupdated professional techniques in training as well as comprehensive knowledge of government\nauditing in the region, can also serve as valuable resources for ongoing and future country-\nspecific capacity-building TA of ADB.\n6. In  line  with  its  objective  to  promote  good  governance  and  in  pursuance  of  its\nanticorruption  policy,  ADB  should  continue  to  support  upgrading  of  the  SAIs'  capability,\nespecially, considering the SAIs' important role in strengthening accountability in public sector\nmanagement.  Upgrading  audit  capability  is  expected  to  also  contribute  to  a  more  timely\nsubmission of audited financial statements and better quality of audit reports, thus strengthening\nthe financial management of ADB-funded projects.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n7. The objective of the TA is to strengthen the capacity of SPASAI and individual SAIs and,\nat the same time, encourage cooperation among the SAIs in the region. Specifically, the TA will\ntest and reinforce the training knowledge and skills learned from Phase I, and upgrade the\nauditing skills of SAI auditors in the South Pacific.\nB.  Scope\n8. Phase II will consist of a 10-day regional audit workshop consisting of 8 days on audit\nprogramming and documentation, and 2 days for the train-the-trainer module. The 8-day portion\nof the 10-day workshop includes a module on fraud awareness and has integrated references to\nthe audit requirements of ADB-funded projects in discussions on the financial audit process.\nThe 2-day train-the-trainer portion will upgrade the presentation skills of the participants and\nassist them in effectively passing on their acquired audit knowledge and skills to other auditors\nin their respective SAIs. The selected instructors for the regional audit workshop will be able to\napply in practice what they learned from the CDDW and ITW conducted in Phase I.\n9. Phase II will also include a 4-day regional planning workshop for the heads of the SAIs.\nThis  will  be  offered  in  two-parts,  before  and  after  the  SPASAI  Congress  scheduled  for", "3\nNovember 2000.  The  workshop  will  provide  the heads of  the South  Pacific  SAIs  with an\nopportunity  to  discuss  the  regional  operational  plan  formulated  by  the  SPASAI  Regional\nTraining Committee (RTC)5 and the application of current auditing standards and procedures in\ntheir respective SAIs. This will enable them to prepare specific timebound action plans for the\nregion and for their respective SAIs. In pursuance of ADB's anticorruption efforts, the regional\nplanning workshop will also enable the SAI heads to (i) review the proposed regional guide on\nfraud awareness and the course materials on investigating fraud developed during Phase I, and\n(ii) discuss their application at the regional and local levels.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n10. The TA is estimated to cost $373,000 equivalent, of which $200,000 will be provided by\nADB. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.\nSPASAI will finance the remaining $173,000 equivalent (Appendix 2).\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n11. The Office of the Controller and Auditor General of New Zealand (OCAG), the SPASAI\nSecretariat,  will  continue  to  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  Phase  II,  having  proven  its\neffectiveness in Phase I. OCAG will be responsible for administering the TA funds, organizing\nand managing the TA activities, and reporting to ADB. OCAG will enter into a contract with IDI\nfor the design, development, and delivery of the program activities over a 12-month period\nbeginning May 2000. IDI and OCAG will keep adequate project accounting records and reports.\nOCAG will also assure and monitor the timeliness and quality of IDI's performance.\n12. The technical audit course to be delivered in Phase II, as well as the regional guide on\nfraud awareness and course materials on investigating fraud, will be finalized in consultation\nwith ADB. Criteria for selection of resource persons, instructors, and participants will be agreed\nto by ADB.\n13.  ADB will finance the international travel, accommodation, and per diem of instructors,\nresource persons, and participants from the DMCs in the 10-day regional audit workshop. Each\nSAI will be allowed one or two participants for a maximum class size of 25 to permit effective\nlearning and interaction among participants. ADB will also finance the accommodation and per\ndiem of the 12 heads of SAIs from the DMCs, as well as the travel costs, fees, and per diems of\nIDI resource persons during the 4-day regional planning workshop. ADB will also finance the\npreparation and reproduction of workshop materials, rental of training facilities and equipment,\nshipping  costs  of  course  materials,  telecommunications,  and  other  relevant  miscellaneous\nexpenses. SPASAI and relevant SAIs will finance other services as described in Appendix 2.\nSince the regional workshops will be held in an ADB member country selected by SPASAI, in\nconsultation with its member SAIs, most of the basic cost of hosting the workshops (e.g.,\nregistration services, and administrative and clerical support) will be provided by the host SAI.\n                                               \n5  During the SPASAI RTC Meeting under Phase I, a regional operational training plan was developed outlining\nactivities and resources required to meet the strategic goals and objectives set out in an earlier strategic planning\nmeeting aimed to strengthen the member SAIs in the South Pacific through training and information-sharing\nopportunities. The RTC is a subcommittee of the governing board of SPASAI, and is responsible for, among\nothers, periodically identifying training needs and priorities in the region; developing plans to meet these needs,\nand supervising the implementation of approved regional training plans; developing and implementing plans to\nevaluate training activities; and maintaining and disseminating information on training activities in the region. The\nRTC consists of heads of the SAIs of Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.\nThe RTC meeting was facilitated by IDI.", "4\nImplementation  will  be  monitored  based  on  the  performance  targets  and  monitoring\nmechanisms set out in the TA framework. An evaluation framework developed and adopted by\nIDI in a similar training program for another regional working group of INTOSAI6 will provide a\nmechanism for lessons learned and feedback from earlier programs to be considered in making\nnecessary modifications to the workshop materials by the RTC. The evaluation framework\noutlines the tasks to be performed by the SAIs, IDI, RTC, and ADB during and following the\ntraining program to assess the outputs, effects, and impacts of the program.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n14. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$200,000 for the Long-Term Regional Training Program for Members of the South Pacific\nAssociation of Supreme Audit Institutions, Phase II, and hereby reports such action to the\nBoard.\n                                               \n6  Please refer to TAs 5688 and 5872-REG, Regional Long-Term Audit Training Program for Members of the Asian\nOrganization of Supreme Audit Institutions (Phases I and II), for $1,000,000 and $300,000 approved on 13 June\n1996 and 3 December 1999, respectively.", "5\nAppendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\nA.
