INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  address  the  issue  of \nnonperforming loans (NPLs) in Asia and the Pacific region by supporting the development of a \nnational strategy and a market for NPLs or distressed assets through research and capacity \nbuilding. This will be coupled with knowledge sharing through Annual Summit Meetings and \nConferences of the International Public Asset Management Company Forum (IPAF), as well as \ntraining workshops to build the capacity of public asset management companies (AMCs), deposit \ninsurance institutions, and other invited regional participants to manage distressed assets.  \n \n2.  Under  the  TA  on  the  Establishment  of  the  International  Public  Asset  Management \nCompany Forum,1 the IPAF strengthened the existing knowledge base on the assessment of \ncountry-level NPLs and shared resolution experiences unique to each country\u2019s development \ncontext and economic situation.2 The TA team completed four research papers providing policy \ntools and options by building on empirical analyses of NPL resolution, including individual country \nexperiences in Asia as well as cross-regional experiences. The IPAF was established in 2013, \nwith seven member institutions from five countries. Over time, the IPAF\u2019s membership expanded \nto include deposit insurance institutions. The IPAF currently has 12 member institutions.3  \n \n3.  The TA supports Regional Cooperation and Integration (RCI), a key strategic agenda \nunder Strategy 2020.4 This TA will also contribute to the third strategic pillar of the RCI Strategy, \n20065\u2014the  development,  deepening,  and  harmonization  of  regional  financial  markets\u2014by \nsupporting regional forums and regional macroeconomic and financial stability through research \nand information dissemination, capacity building, and institutional strengthening and partnership. \nThe TA project\u2019s purpose is also aligned with the Financial Sector Operational Plan, 20116 and \nthe plan\u2019s mid-term review, 20177 by supporting banks and nonbank financial institutions, and \ninvesting in NPL resolution and AMCs. It is also aligned with the RCI Operational Plan, 20168 in \nhelping developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) harness \nincreased benefits through improved cooperation and integration and by strengthening ADB\u2019s \ninstitutional capacity to encourage RCI through a larger, more innovative portfolio.9 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

A sound financial system is crucial to support economic growth and poverty reduction. \nTherefore, DMCs must safeguard the soundness of their financial systems to ensure that financial \nmarkets and systems function well as intermediaries while maintaining financial stability. NPLs \nthreaten financial stability and are often linked to financial crises, as they affect both lenders (by \nreducing  capital  resources  for  lending  and  increasing  the  probability  of  bank  failure)  and \nborrowers (by increasing the probability of bankruptcy due to debt default). Financial crises, which \nare costly and detrimental to growth and poverty reduction, tend to raise NPL volumes, and \npersistently high NPLs in turn hinder crisis recovery.  \n \n5.  NPL management remains the focus of discussions on safeguarding financial stability and \npreventing financial crises effectively and pre-emptively. It is also necessary to consider potential \nspillover effects. The literature on contagion stresses that financial shocks can spread rapidly \nthrough financial linkages and different channels. For example, a shock to one country\u2019s financial \nsector (such as a sharp increase in NPLs or a deposit run) can cause banks in the country to \nreduce lending to banks in other economies as well. Policy responses to the 1997 Asian Financial \nCrisis and recent European debt crisis reveal that AMCs in Asia and Europe play a critical role in \nfacilitating bank restructuring and asset recovery and therefore represent an important layer of \nnational financial safety nets. \n \n6.  While NPLs accounted for less than 3% of total gross loans in most economies in Asia \nand the Pacific region in 2016, this ratio was greater than 5% in Afghanistan, Bhutan, the Maldives, \nand Pakistan; and it was 10% in Tajikistan.10 Due to data reporting limitations in some countries, \nthese figures may underestimate the true level of NPLs. For example, in December 2016, \nMongolia\u2019s NPL ratio was 8.5%, but this figure is expected to increase, because banks have been \nallowed to reschedule past due loans and NPLs leniently due to regulatory forbearance by the \nBank of Mongolia. Many economies in developing Asia have also recognized loans as normal \nand performing under practices that differ from international best practice. Moreover, many \neconomies in Asia appear to lack adequate supervision, NPL data tracking, and resolution \nmechanisms. For example, according to World Bank data, of the 48 Asian regional members, \nonly 28 report banking sector NPL data. \n \n7.  Steady increases in NPLs in some regional economies alarm policy makers and market \nplayers alike. In this context, during the IPAF Summit in October 2015, IPAF members issued a \njoint statement calling for (i) the strengthening of IPAF members\u2019 operational capacity, (ii) \nenhanced coordination and cooperation among IPAF members, and (iii) an improved framework \nfor the IPAF platform. IPAF members asked ADB to continue in its role as IPAF Secretariat to \nbuild IPAF member capacity to deal with growing NPLs and to conduct a study on developing \nregional NPL markets. This reaffirms the IPAF\u2019s aim to enhance financial stability, financial \ndevelopment,  and  inclusive  growth  by  addressing  financial  vulnerabilities,  contagion,  and \nsystemic risks, as well as by specifically sharing knowledge and policy experience in dealing with \ndistressed assets or NPLs in Asian economies.11 \n \n8.  In response to the growing demand for ADB assistance on these issues, this TA is \nproposed to address the issue of NPLs and distressed assets in Asia, support the design of \nnational NPL strategies and resolution mechanisms, and facilitate the development of NPL or \n                                                \n10 World Bank. World Development Indicators. http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators. \n(accessed 16 March 2017). \n11 IPAF members officially conveyed this message to the ADB Vice President for Knowledge Management and \nSustainable Development, Bambang Susantono, through a letter dated 15 December 2016. \n ", "3 \ndistressed asset markets. Developing such markets is a challenge that requires policy efforts to \nbuild necessary financial market infrastructure, address legal and institutional weaknesses, and \nreview and revise supervisory guidelines and regulatory standards to facilitate NPL write-offs. \nEach economy faces different conditions that must be considered in developing a distressed asset \nmarket\u2014including  legal,  regulatory,  and  institutional  frameworks;  financial  market  and \ninfrastructure development; and fiscal situation. Hence, each development experience offers \nvaluable lessons applicable to the region.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: regional financial stability and resilience in \nAsia strengthened through the design of NPL resolution mechanisms and development of NPL or \ndistressed asset markets (as defined by the TA).12 The TA will have the following outcome: \nstrategies identified and developed for national NPL resolution mechanisms and the development \nof NPL or distressed asset markets in emerging Asia.13  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n10.  Output 1: Knowledge shared through annual summit meetings and conferences. \nThe IPAF conducts annual summit meetings and conferences among its members, joined by \npublic and private sector experts and policy makers to share knowledge and experiences in NPL \nresolution and debt restructuring. IPAF members also meet frequently to discuss strategies for \nNPL resolution and the development of NPL or distressed asset markets as well as concrete \naction plans. In addition to resolution mechanisms, the members may also identify financial \ninfrastructure conditions that could lead to a surge in NPLs, either to preempt such a situation or \nto provide solutions when NPLs become a concern. These meetings benefit DMCs by promoting \nawareness and the adoption of a national strategy and potential mechanisms for NPL resolution \nappropriate to each country\u2019s economic and financial environments. ADB and the IPAF chair will \njointly organize and host the annual IPAF summits, at which participants will discuss strategic \ndirections for the IPAF in the succeeding years, and progress will be monitored and evaluated \nbased on the IPAF charter and on this TA\u2019s Design and Monitoring Framework. \n \n11.  Output 2: Research undertaken. This TA will produce major research papers and case \nstudies on successes and failures in dealing with distressed assets in the region, and explore \nways to strengthen Asia\u2019s financial safety nets, including the buttressing of potential roles for \nAMCs and deposit insurance schemes, thereby addressing the issues raised above (para 6). Key \nresearch activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  a study on developing NPL markets, including their prerequisites, strategies, and \npossible modalities; \n(ii)  a study on national and regional approaches or policy recommendations for dealing \nwith distressed assets, focused on developing strategies to develop NPL or distressed \nasset market; and  \n(iii)  a study on the legal and regulatory aspects of NPLs, possibly including an analysis of \nthe debt and distressed assets of state-owned enterprises, and Asia\u2019s experience in \n                                                \n12 One measurable performance indicator for this impact would be reduced NPL ratios which indicate a healthier \nbanking sector in the region. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \ndealing with NPLs, including financial supervision and market development compared \nto other regional approaches. \n \nThe research findings will be presented in conferences and seminars, in collaboration with the \nFinance Sector Group to reach as many finance sector professionals in ADB as possible.  These \nfindings will inform country partnership strategies and country operations business plans for \nDMCs, as well as operations departments\u2019 engagements with the public sector and private sector \ninstitutions dealing with financial stability. The findings will be published and disseminated through \nknowledge sharing events. \n \n12.  Output 3: Training workshops conducted. One training program will be conducted each \nyear  during  2018\u20132020  to  build the capacity of financial  authorities,  public  AMCs,  deposit \ninsurance institutions, and other invited participants to manage distressed assets. It is critical for \nAMCs with advanced skills in distressed asset management and financial strength to share their \nknowledge and experiences with new AMCs in the region. This will help AMCs expand operations \noutside their home bases, creating win-win value and promoting regional skills transfer. \n \n13.  Output 4: International Public Asset Management Company Forum promotion and \nexpansion effected through website management. The IPAF will continue to provide members \nwith online access to relevant data and information, research papers, reference materials, training \nschedules, and networking data through continued management of the IPAF website. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which $250,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6), $125,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund and \nadministered by ADB, and $125,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea \n(ROK) e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB.14 Key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  Civil works, the procurement of large-scale equipment, permanent staffing costs, and the \nhiring of staff consultants are ineligible expenditures under the PRC Poverty Reduction and \nRegional Cooperation Fund and the ROK e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. \n \n16.  Partner agencies could provide meeting or workshop venues free of charge and assign \nstaff support. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and resource persons; procure \ngoods;  organize  workshops  and  summits  with  partner  agencies;  and  provide  staff  and/or \ncoordinate ADB staff for supporting services and participation in the workshops. \n  \n                                                \n14 The PRC Ministry of Finance approved the financing of this TA under the PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund 2017 on 12 December 2017. On the other hand, the ROK\u2019s Ministry of Strategy and Finance \napproved the financing of this TA under the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund on 1 June 2017. \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual  12.0 person-months  $145,200 \n(International) \nIndividual (National)  44.0 person-months  $145,200 \nIndividual (Resource  1.6 person-months  $36,000 \nPersons) \nProcurementa  To be procured by ADB \nShopping  1 contract  $5,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursement arrangement will be pro-rata. \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \na Procurement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: ADB. \n \n18.
