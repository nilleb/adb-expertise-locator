The government has identified the priority areas to be covered under the ensuing loan \nproject and prepared outline technical studies for the proposed project components. A project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to review these studies and develop a \nproject suitable for ADB funding in terms of technical, financial, economic, institutional, sector \npolicy, legal, and safeguard contexts, in conjunction with the country partnership strategy (CPS), \noperational experience, and lessons from evaluations of previous projects. The PPTA will follow \nthe Government of Viet Nam\u2019s Decision 48/2008/QD-ttg on Common General Guidelines on \nFeasibility Study Preparation for Official Development Assistance (ODA) Projects Funded by the \nFive Banks issued on 4 March 2008. \n \n2.  During reconnaissance, the three project cities submitted proposal amounts beyond the \navailable funds allocated for the proposed project. The mission requested the project cities to \nprioritize project components and subcomponents according to the development challenges and \nopportunities facing each city.  Discussions between the mission and project cities, including \ntheir proposals are outlined below.  \n \n3.  Buon Ma Thuot. The proposal for Buon Ma Thuot includes the following outputs: (i) \nurban road improvement and network extensions of seven sections with total length of about \n24.5 km; (ii) sanitary landfill, including materials recovery facility (for garbage segregation, \nrecycling) and special treatment for hospital waste; and (iii) capacity building and community \nawareness. It is proposed that ADB finance $55.68 million of the estimated total project cost of \n$69.6 million. The mission commented that these proposed investments would be suitable for \nADB financing. Output 1 seems suitable for ordinary capital resources (OCR) financing. \n \n4.  Ha Tinh. The proposal submitted by Ha Tinh includes the following outputs: (i) urban \nroad improvements of four sections with total length of about 11.53 km; (ii) flood protection and \ndrainage including improvement of five main drains of about 8.5 km and two regulating basins of \nabout 35 ha; and (iii) capacity building and community awareness. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $50.5 million of the estimated project cost of $56 million.  All three outputs are eligible \nfor ADB financing. However, it is suggested not to include land acquisition and compensation \ncosts, including small subcomponents like tree planting along new roads, as these could be \naccommodated under local budgets.  Output 1 seems suitable for OCR financing. \n \n5.  Tam Ky. The proposal for Tam Ky consisted of the following outputs: (i) 9.17 km urban \nroad with drainage to develop the new eastern part of the city; (ii) 5.93 km of flood protection \ndyke and river regulation works; (iii) 1.3 km of diversion channels and tide doors for flood \nprotection; (iv) 3 km road at the west of the North\u2013South railway trans-section; and (v) capacity \nbuilding and community awareness. It is proposed that ADB finance $50 million of the estimated \nproject cost of $56.2 million. All four outputs would be eligible for ADB financing. Output 1 \nseems suitable for OCR financing. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The PPTA will (i) review and update long and medium term urban development plans for \nBuon Ma Thuot, Ha Tinh, and Tam Ky; (ii) help prioritize project components; (iii) determine the \nfeasibility of the proposed investments for infrastructure construction and improvement covering \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n \n(a) preliminary engineering designs, (b) cost estimates and financing plan, (c) financial and \neconomic  viability  and  sustainability,  (d)  environmental  and  social  soundness  (including \ndocumentation  and  consultation  of  ethnic  minorities),  and  (e)  detailed  implementation \narrangements; and (iv) prepare an institutional capacity building program. The PPTA will also \nprepare the project administration manual (PAM) that includes all the information and schedules \ndescribing project implementation. The urban planning review will take into account existing \nregional development plans, particularly in the case of Ha Tinh. It will also consider climate \nchange adaptation requirements in the case of Ha Tinh and Tam Ky. The major outputs and \nactivities of the PPTA are summarized in Table A4.1. TA Resources will be allocated to help the \nexecuting  agencies  and  implementing  agencies  engage  project  management  consultants, \nreview the feasibility studies, and prepare for the detailed designs to ensure the smooth project \nstart-up. \n \nTable A4.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nCompletion  Major  Completion \nMajor Activities  Date  Outputs  Date \n1.
