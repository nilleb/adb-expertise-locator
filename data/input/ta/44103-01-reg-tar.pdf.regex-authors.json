INTRODUCTION \n1.  Fiscal  sustainability  has  not  traditionally  been  a  major  policy  concern  in  most  of \ndeveloping Asia. Because of conservative policies and speedy responses to fiscal slippages, \nbudget deficits in the Asia and Pacific have generally been small, and public debt (in relation to \ngross domestic product [GDP]) has not reached the high levels seen in other parts of the world. \nThis is not to say that developing Asia has been immune from sovereign debt crises, particularly \ninvolving external foreign-currency-denominated debt. Many Asian countries have experienced \ncrises either individually (for example, Indonesia in the 1960s, India in the 1970s, and the \nPhilippines in the 1980s) or as part of a wider regional trend such as the 1997\u20131998 Asian \nfinancial crisis. After the Asian financial crisis, fiscal positions improved across developing Asia, \nsubstantially lowering public debt ratios. Some countries endorsed rules for fiscal discipline and \nin pursuit of debt targets. In the meantime, countries with persistent current account surpluses \nwere piling up foreign exchange reserves to protect against speculative attacks, external shocks, \nor sudden capital reversals.  \n \n2.  The 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis spurned massive government stimulus programs \nworldwide in an effort to keep economies afloat. Before the crisis, countries in developing Asia \nbenefited from fiscal positions that provided plenty of space for fiscal intervention, which they \nused extensively to support their economies. The crisis inevitably caused fiscal positions to \ndeteriorate across Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs). Debt \nratios spiked and debt sustainability was affected, but to varying degrees among DMCs. The \nresearch and development technical assistance (TA) for Sovereign Debt Sustainability in Asia \nand the Pacific will assess the sustainability of sovereign debt in developing Asia.1 The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Sovereign  debt  sustainability  refers  to  a  country's  ability  to  continue  servicing  its \ndomestic or external public debt without an unrealistically large future correction to the budget or \nthe balance of payments. Fiscal sustainability refers to a country's ability to smoothly finance the \nbudget without generating explosive increases in public debt. External debt sustainability refers \nto  a  country's  ability  to  meet  current  and  future  external  obligations  without  arrears,  debt \nrescheduling, and/or an eventual drastic adjustment of the balance of payments. \n \n4.  The Asian Development Outlook 20102 report (ADO 2010) and ADB Economics Working \nPaper Series No. 2053 analyzed the implications of the global economic downturn on fiscal \nhealth in developing Asia. The main finding was that a history of fiscal rectitude provided Asian \ncountries with the policy space and fiscal muscle to intervene vigorously when the global crisis \nhit and demand for Asian exports stalled. However, the ADO 2010 also noted that it is risky to \nkeep fiscal spending at crisis levels for too long, as it may cause debt ratios to balloon. By \ncontrast,  a  gradual  return  to  pre-crisis  fiscal  rectitude,  combined  with  strong  economic \nexpansion and a moderate increase in interest rates over time, was shown to project into debt \nratios that did not raise concerns about sovereign debt sustainability. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA concept paper was cleared on 22 July 2010. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of \nADB\u2019s website on 8 October 2010. \n2  ADB. 2010. Asian Development Outlook 2010. Manila. \n3  C. Adams, B. Ferrarini, and D. Park. 2010. Fiscal Sustainability in Developing Asia. ADB Economics Working \nPaper Series No. 205. Manila: Asian Development Bank. \n ", "2         \n5.  Although ADO 2010 found Asia and the Pacific as a whole to be on a sound fiscal \nfooting, the picture gets more nuanced for individual DMCs. Some countries' debt ratios are \nbeyond comfort levels or may become unsustainable if assumptions about future growth and \ninterest rates prove overly optimistic. Moreover, sustainability concerns are likely to increase if \nforecasting scenarios envisaged a broader range of shocks economies may be subjected to in \nthe future, such as a sharp rise in interest rates or a marked slowdown of economic growth.  \n \n6.  Assessing sovereign debt sustainability in developing Asia more thoroughly will require a \nbroader range of analytical methods, including stochastic simulation.4 Compared with the simple \ndeterministic  projections  underlying  standard  methods  of  assessing  debt  sustainability, \nstochastic simulation more effectively accounts for historical patterns of relationships among the \ndeterminants of debt ratios (e.g., GDP growth, interest rates, exchange rates, primary deficits), \nand  accounts  for  a  broader  range  of  shocks  and  combinations  that  might  affect  debt \nsustainability. On the downside, stochastic analysis is more data-intensive and less transparent \nthan simple debt projections.  \n \n7.  Analyses of debt sustainability should reflect the structure and composition of public debt, \nas well as institutional characteristics that may complicate a country\u2019s debt dynamics. For \nexample, countries facing highly decentralized sovereign debt usually find it more difficult to rein \nin local government debt and profligacy compared with countries that merely manage central \ndebt accounts. Because of scarce data, such issues are often disregarded by standard debt \nsustainability analysis, and require instead in-depth country knowledge and the use of ad hoc \nassessment methods.  \n \n8.  Finally, in some countries sustainability problems may arise because of large contingent \nliabilities and publicly guaranteed debt, whether in connection with state-owned enterprises, \nquasi-public entities, or implicit guarantees extended to private sector debt. Other countries face \ndebt sustainability concerns not so much because of past borrowing but as a reflection of future \nfiscal  gaps  resulting  from  demographic  pressures  from,  for  instance,  aging  populations  or \ngrowing dependency ratios. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  This TA will assess sovereign debt sustainability in the Asia and Pacific region. The first \ncomponent of this project will consist of a conceptual study reviewing alternative approaches to \ndebt sustainability assessment, including stochastic analysis to account for contingent liabilities.  \n \n10.  The second component will build on the empirical analysis of the ADO 2010, which \nfocused mainly on regions, updating the analysis with the most recent post-crisis debt and \nmacroeconomic data and upgrading the assessment methodology for all DMCs where sufficient \ndata is available. The sustainability assessment will also factor in contingent liabilities and \nimplicit  government  guarantees  to  reflect  transfer  risks  from  semi-public  entities  and  the \ncommercial finance sector. A by-product of this analysis will be the collection of detailed public \ndebt and fiscal data for DMCs to update and expand the database that was originally compiled \nfor the background work on the ADO 2010. \n \n                                                 \n4  Stochastic simulation refers to the probabilistic approach to debt sustainability analysis. Simply put, it consists of \nrepeated simulations of random shocks, from which large samples of sovereign debt projections are constructed \nover the simulation horizon. The corresponding frequency distributions yield a probabilistic assessment of debt \ndynamics.  \n ", "      3 \n11.  The third and most central component of this TA will consist of four country studies. \nDrawing on consultants\u2019 specific country knowledge and expertise and a deeper pool of data \nand information sources, these analyses will assess debt sustainability in depth in the four \nselected countries and lay out the policy implications. The lessons from country experiences will \nbe summarized to serve the broader discussion of debt sustainability in Asia and the Pacific. An \ninception workshop and insights from past research will help pinpoint which countries out of \nthose  facing  sovereign  debt  issues  are  most  suitable  for  the  case  studies.  The  selected \ncountries should be from different regions of developing Asia and should be at different levels of \neconomic development. Other factors influencing country selection include data constraints and \nthe availability of consultants with sufficient country expertise. \n \n12.  The findings of this TA will be published as an edited research volume (book) of thematic, \nempirical, and country studies. Research methods and outputs will be discussed at country \nworkshops that will bring together ADB staff, international consultants, and other stakeholders. \nSelected  studies  will  also  be  presented  at  international  conferences  and  submitted  for \npublication in scholarly journals. Policy notes will be disseminated to the general public through \nthe media.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of this TA will be to contribute to the implementation and interpretation of \nsovereign debt sustainability assessments in Asia and the Pacific. An additional impact of this \nTA  will  be  an  increased  perception  of  ADB  as  a  knowledge  creator  in  the  field  of  debt \nsustainability assessment, through TA workshops, publications, and the dissemination of policy \nnotes. \n \n14.  The outcome of this TA will be a more thorough understanding of the determinants and \nrisks underlying sovereign debt sustainability in Asia and the Pacific. \n \n15.  The output of this TA will be an edited book comprising the conceptual study, the \nempirical study, and the country studies. The planned table of contents of the book is included \nin Appendix 4. An additional output of this TA will be an up-to-date database of public debt and \nfiscal data across DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will hire a lead consultant to provide the conceptual study and to assist with the \ncoordination of the project jointly with the ADB team. Four additional consultants with in-depth \ncountry knowledge and experience will be hired for the country studies. These experts will \nidentify the methods most suitable for assessing debt sustainability in the countries selected for \ncountry studies. The focus and methods of the country studies are likely to differ substantially \nfrom country to country. Additional resource persons will be hired as needed to provide, for \nexample, technical support for the empirical study of debt, including stochastic simulations, in \ncollaboration with ADB team members. A national consultant will be hired to assist with logistics \nand administrative matters and provide data support and research assistance. \n \n17.  The analytical framework adopted for the conceptual and empirical studies will build on \nthe  analysis  in  ADO  2010  and  the  ADB  Economics  Working  Paper  Series  No.  205.  The \nconceptual  study  will  provide  a  review  of  sovereign  debt  sustainability  and  the  various \nassessment methodologies. The approach will be to combine a rigorous analytical review with \npractical considerations of assessment methods at the country level, to provide a useful, hands-\n ", "4         \non discussion for policy makers in developing Asia. The empirical study will implement a range \nof debt accounting and simulation methodologies, both deterministic and probabilistic. This will \nentail computing fiscal sustainability indicators, estimating policy reaction functions (i.e., the \nextent  to  which  DMC  governments  adjust  primary  deficits  to  changes  in  debt  ratios),  and \nimplementing stochastic assessment methods for countries where sufficient data is available.  \n \n18.  ADB team members, project consultants, and resource persons will finalize the research \nplan and select the countries for case studies at an inception workshop at ADB headquarters. \nSubsequently, a workshop will be held in each of the selected countries, bringing together \ncountry authorities and local stakeholders with the ADB team members and the international \nconsultant performing the country analysis. Upon the draft country studies being completed, \ncountry authorities and/or local experts and scholars will be invited to contribute commentary on \neach study for inclusion in the book.  \n \n19.  The research will be disseminated by presenting the research studies at international \nconferences and disseminating policy notes to the media. The main research outputs will be \npresented and discussed at a conference at ADB headquarters, and will be edited for book \npublication. A book launch and media event will conclude the TA.   \n \n20.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  of  the  TA  concern  the  availability  of  qualified \nconsultants,  as  sovereign  debt  issues  and  debt  sustainability  analysis  is  a  narrow  and \nspecialized field. It may prove difficult to find consultants that have both the technical expertise \nand  the  country  knowledge  to  produce  debt  sustainability  assessments  and  policy \nrecommendations that add substantial value to other organizations\u2019 extensive work in the field\u2014\nmost notably the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \n \n21.  Another area of difficulty concerns the scarcity of data. For many developing countries\u2014\nparticularly the low income countries\u2014fiscal records and debt data are notoriously incomplete \nand of low quality. Data issues at the country level may undermine the scope and range of \nempirical analysis, and computational differences may render the data largely incomparable \nacross countries. Moreover, country authorities tend to be sensitive about the release of fiscal \ndata, and IMF datasets are usually not in the public domain. Obtaining data on DMCs for the \nADO 2010 involved a painstaking process of extracting data from a large amount of IMF and \nother official country documents and reports.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n22.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $455,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The financing will cover \nthe remuneration, per diem, and travel expenses of international consultants as well as the \ntravel expenses of ADB team members, travel expenses of conference and workshop resource \npersons, report production, equipment, and other miscellaneous expenses. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will build on the inputs of consultants hired for \nthis project, as well as on the inputs of ADB team members working in collaboration with the \nlead consultant on the empirical study, project supervision, and final editing of the book chapters. \nCounterpart institutions will not play a substantive role. However, sporadic collaboration with \n ", "      5 \nDMC governments5 and other stakeholders, including the IMF and the World Bank, will be \nsought,  mainly  in  the  form  of  data  input  or  participation  in  workshops.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 20 months (December 2010\u2013July 2012). \n \n24.  The TA will require 6 months of international consulting. One lead consultant (economist) \nwill be hired for 2 person-months to coordinate the technical aspects throughout the course of \nthe project and to edit the final research outputs jointly with the ADB team members. The lead \nconsultant will also contribute to the conceptual study. Four consultants will be hired for 1 \nperson-month each to conduct the country studies. A national consultant will be hired for 8 \nperson-months to help with the logistics and organizational matters, and to provide research \nassistance. Resource persons will be invited to provide specific inputs, such as technical advice \non a particular simulation technique, or to comment on draft studies.  \n \n25.  The consultants will be selected and hired individually by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. Disbursements under the project will follow ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To \nsupport the database compilation and simulations, software (e.g., Stata 64-bit, MatLab) and \ncomputer  equipment  will  be  purchased  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information \nSystems  and  Technology  and  Office  of  Administrative  Services,  where  applicable.  The \nequipment purchased under the TA will be turned over to ADB upon completion of the TA. \n \n26.  Disseminating the outputs and outcome evaluation will involve one workshop in each of \nthe countries selected for the case studies. These events and related follow-up discussions will \nprovide ample opportunities for exchanges between TA research staff, consultants, and local \nstakeholders. Outcome evaluation will be gathered also by soliciting commentary on country \nstudies from local experts, such as finance ministers, to be incorporated into the final report. A \nconcluding TA conference on debt sustainability in Asia and the Pacific will serve as a broader \nplatform of dialogue and evaluation of this project, involving representatives from government \nand partner institutions. Peer review of conceptual, empirical and country studies will assess the \nquality of the book. Research findings and policy notes will be disseminated through workshops \nand conferences, publication of the edited book, and media exposure.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $455,000 on a grant basis for \nSovereign Debt Sustainability in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n \n                                                 \n5 A no-objection letter from the chosen DMC will be sought before the TA is implemented in any particular country. \n ", "6        Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \n      Assumption \nContribute to the  At least one DMC uses the  DMC fiscal authorities refer  An assessment of \nimplementation and  findings of this TA to improve  to TA outputs as a source  sovereign debt in \ninterpretation of  its debt sustainability  of input in the context of  developing Asia is useful, \nsovereign debt  capabilities within 24 months  debt sustainability  timely, and adds value to \nsustainability  from the inception of this TA  assessment activities  other organizations\u2019 \nassessments in Asia    extensive work in the field, \nand the Pacific    such as the DSA provided \n  by IMF and World Bank \n \nRisk \nData limitations and \nmethodological \ncomplexities render the TA \nunappealing to policy \nmakers, limiting its impact \n \nOutcome       \n      Assumption \nA more thorough  At least one DMC cites the  Feedback from DMC  Research findings and key \nunderstanding of the  findings and  governments gathered  messages are \ndeterminants and risks  recommendations of this TA  through communications at  communicated effectively \nunderlying sovereign  in government policy  TA country workshops, final  and reach the appropriate \ndebt sustainability in  statements, knowledge  conference, or follow-up  level of government \ndeveloping Asia  products, or administrative  discussions   \n  reports, within 12 months     \nafter publication of the TA  Official policy statements,  Risks \n  book  administrative reports, and  Competent sovereign debt \ngovernment policy papers  experts with ample \n \n  regional and country \n  knowledge cannot be hired \n  Insufficient availability of \ndata undermines the \n  \npotentially most insightful \nsimulation exercises, or \nlimits the analytical depth \nof the country studies   \n \nFour country studies  are \ninsufficient to provide a \nbroad overview of the \nmajor sustainability issues \nin developing Asia \n \n ", "Appendix 1      7 \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nOutputs       \n      Assumptions \n1.
