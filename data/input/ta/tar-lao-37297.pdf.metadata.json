While many rural livelihood improvement programs of aid agencies and nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) provide a wide range of income-generating assistance for poor rural \nfarmers  in  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR),  some  farmers  experienced \ndifficulties in realizing additional cash earning by selling incremental products. The experience \nunderscores the significance of support to expand market channels and generate higher value-\nadded products. Based on that lesson, establishment of business linkages over the medium \nterm  in  partnership  with  private  enterprises  was  sought  in  the  design  of  a  new  income- \ngenerating assistance for poor ethnic minority farmers. In close consultation with the local \nbusiness community, NGOs, and ethnic minority farmers, the concept of the Marketing Support \nfor Organic Produce of Ethnic Minorities Project was developed and endorsed by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund (PRF) strategy meeting in December 2002 for PRF financing. \nSubsequently, the Government of the Lao PDR confirmed its request for technical assistance \n(TA) for the Project during the 2003 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB). A Fact-Finding Mission from ADB visited the Lao PDR during 4\u201312 December \n2003 and reached an understanding with the Government on the project objective, scope, \nimplementation, and costs and financing arrangements.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Poverty incidence is high in rural areas where 53% of the population fall below the \nnational  poverty  line.2  Ethnic  minority  groups  are  particularly  poor:  while  the  Mon-Khmer, \nHmong-Mien, and Tibeto-Burmese represent only 44% of the total population, their poverty \nshare is about 80%.3 They survive on shifting cultivation, food collection from forests, and \nincome  from  agricultural  labor,  livestock,  and  handicraft  making.  The  participatory  poverty \nassessment 4 found that ethnic minorities in upland areas are particularly in a state of severe \npoverty.  The  major  causes  of  impoverishment  are  limited  productive  land  and  income- \ngenerating opportunities in rural villages. Among limited earning opportunities, sales of non-\ntimber forestry products (NTFP), especially those which are grown naturally, and handicrafts are \nimportant sources of cash incomes for some ethnic minority groups in upland rural villages. For \ninstance, sales of NTFP, such as rattan, cardamom, mushroom, and herbs, typically account for \nabout 40% of a household\u2019s annual income, and the ratio increases to 80% in poor villages \nwhere no other income-earning opportunities exist. Given the level of poverty incidence and the \neconomic state of ethnic minority groups, support to identify new market channels for their \nagricultural products, especially those grown organically, and to help them respond to the \nidentified opportunities is directly relevant to their income-earning level. And increased sales of \nsuch items sold traditionally by ethnic minorities are expected to immediately  improve the \nlivelihood of the vulnerable groups.  \n \n3.  Many poor ethnic minorities have a wealth of indigenous knowledge of organic NTFP, \ntraditional medicine, and handicraft making.  Ethnic minority farmers produce for sale mostly \nbasic  on-farm  commodities  such  as  maize,  and  some  nonfarm  commodities  such  as \nhandicrafts. Their sales channels are often limited to local markets and traders that visit their \nvillages.  Within  ecotourism  areas,  village  visits  of  tourists  also  give  occasional  sales \nopportunities. NTFPs collected by ethnic minority villagers are typically sold in a raw state to \nlocal traders, and usually leave the country without any processing. Major constraints that ethnic \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 7 February 2004.  \n2 National Statistical Center. 1997.

Vientiane. \n4 ADB. 2002. Participatory Poverty Assessment in Lao PDR. Manila. ", "2   \nminority groups face with the existing marketing channels, which were identified during village \nconsultations,5 include (i) a limited number of buyers and infrequent sales opportunities; and (ii) \nsales prices that are too low to adequately compensate their labor inputs, and weak bargaining \npower of ethnic minorities due to lack of competition among buyers. Due to low sale prices of \ntheir  traditional  handicraft  products,  villagers  tend  to  minimize  their  labor  inputs  for  the \nproduction  of  sale  items  by  simplifying  traditional  weaving  and  embroidery  patterns,  and \nreplacing hand-woven and naturally dyed clothes with factory-made materials that are available \nin local markets. Consequently, the quality of their produce drops, and some villages are \ngradually  losing  their  traditional  knowledge  and  skills  in  producing  woven  materials  and \nembroideries with the use of organically grown cotton, natural dye, and traditional patterns. In \naddition, the existing marketing channels do not differentiate organically grown products, which \ncould yield higher values in other markets. \n \n4.  To address such constraints, marketing channels for their on-farm commodities need to \nbe expanded, and they should upgrade their nonfarm commodities to supply to new markets \nthat appreciate organic products. Two alternative marketing channels in the Lao PDR that ethnic \nminority groups could access, and appear to be effective options to satisfy such marketing \nneeds are contract farming6 for on-farm products such as maize, soybeans, rattan, cardamom, \nand domesticated NTFPs, and fair trade markets7 for nonfarm products such as handicrafts.  \nBoth trading arrangements can provide (i) incremental and continuous sales opportunities \nthrough  orders  placed,  (ii)  higher  sales  price  that  ensure  higher  return  to  labor,  and  (iii) \nconsequential better bargaining power toward local traders because of increased alternative \nsales opportunities. They also provide inputs and services required to access new markets, \nsuch as product development and marketing service, input and technical assistance, financing, \npacking  and  distribution support.  Assistance to link ethnic minority communities with such \nalternative markets can generate additional marketing opportunities and higher income in the \nrural villages, while preserving indigenous cultures with the least disturbance to the minorities\u2019 \nsocial lives. By involving private enterprises in the form of contract-based production schemes \nunder fair trade or contract farming systems, the provision of inputs and services that ethnic \nminority farmers need to access new markets has good potential to be sustained. \n \n5.  Initiatives to expand and diversify contract-farming arrangements have the potential to \nsignificantly expand market channels for on-farm commodities of ethnic minority farmers. In the \nLao PDR, some private agroprocessing enterprises and NGOs\u2019 programs have developed \ncontract-farming arrangements with poor farmers, including ethnic minority farmers, for grain \n                                                 \n5 A fact-finding mission conducted 10 village meetings in Luang Namtha, Luang Prabang and Phongsaly provinces \nwith ethnic minority villagers including Akha, Hmong, Lantan, Tai Dam, and Yao ethnic groups.  \n6 Coulter, J., A. Goodland, A. Tallontire, and R. Stringfellow. 1999.  Marrying Farmer Cooperation and Contract \nFarming for Agricultural Service Provision in Sub-Saharan Africa, ODI Natural Resources Perspectives, No. 48.  \nContract farming refers to the supply contracts between private agribusiness companies and farmers, under which \nthe companies typically provide inputs (seed, fertilizers, pesticides, and extension advices) on credit and in return \nreceive access to some or all of the farmers' produce. The repayment of any loans and the costs of providing these \nservices are recouped when the produce is sold. \n7  Fair trade is a trading partnership between wholesalers and retailers in developed countries and poor farmers in \ndeveloping countries, which is designed to provide vital income to poor farmers by placing continuous orders over \nthe long run, paying fair prices that will support living wages and safe and healthy conditions for workers in the \ndeveloping countries, and educating consumers about the importance of purchasing fairly traded products. At least \n200 institutions in 55 countries have become members of the International Fair Trade Association, which was \nestablished in 1989 as a coalition of producer organizations, export marketing companies, importers, retailers, \nnational and regional fair trade networks, and financial institutions dedicated to the fair trade movement. Fair trade \norganizations generally assist producers in (i) modifying their products into what will appeal to fair trade markets; \n(ii) making their products conform to safety regulations in the developed countries; (iii) costing and pricing, \nproduction planning and management, distribution, quality control, packing and shipping, billing and collecting, \ncustomer service, and export documentation; and (iv) financing their input purchase.  ", "    3 \ncash crops and domesticated NTFP products. They provide poor farmers with agricultural inputs \nand required extension  assistance and offer purchase contracts for the products at a fixed \nprice.8 Their experiences indicate that commercially successful contract farming that would \ndistribute a substantial share of generated benefits to farmers require (i) willing farmers that \nhave production experience with the concerned crops, (ii) socially responsible agroprocessors \nthat honor the contract purchase price, and (iii) follow-up assistance for farmers to encourage \ncash crop production.9 Relevant lessons from similar experiences  in South Asia and Africa \nindicate that contract farming improves stallholders' access to new market opportunities and \nservices required to support intensified production, and such production groups work best with \nsmall and cohesive groups that are contractually linked to input and output markets over the \nlong-term (footnote 7).  Another key lesson learned highlights the significance of literacy and \nnumeracy skills that are the backbone of viable farmer groups, and suggests that concerted \nefforts be made to assure an adequate level of numeracy and literacy skills appropriate for the \ntasks at hand.10 \n \n6.  Expansion and diversification of such contract farming arrangements between existing \nprivate  agroprocessing  businesses  and  poor  ethnic  minority  farmers  can  be  realized  with \nassistance for community management, capacity building, marketing, and farm productivity \nimprovement. There is also potential to add higher value to their basic on-farm commodities \nthrough processing and product certification such as organic testing.11 While diversification \ncould  lead  to  expanded  markets  for  new  products,  such  product  development  should  be \npreceded by business marketing studies of candidate products in specific potential markets. At \nthe same time, even though export markets for certain crops are identified and agroprocessors \nare willing to increase their purchase from farmers, increasing the number of contracts with \nsmall  farmers  requires  substantial  social,  technical,  and  managerial  support  for  farmers, \nincluding promotional extension activities; establishing farmer groups to organize collection, \nsorting, and transport of their produce; and follow-up assistance.  \n \n7.  With regard to nonfarm commodities, there seems to be significant potential to develop \nhigh value-added commodities by exploiting the comparative advantage of ethnic minorities\u2019 \nproducts under fair trade arrangements. Some of the skills and traditional knowledge of ethnic \nminority groups in making handicraft items from organically grown agricultural produce are \nvaluable and there is a good chance of developing export items for fair trade markets with \nassistance in marketing and management capacity building. For instance, some ethnic minority \nwomen have unique textile and handicraft heritage, and sophisticated skills and traditional \nknowledge in the use of natural materials, natural dyes, organic cotton, and other agricultural \nproduce, which are highly valued by consumers in developed countries. The nature of such \nproducts and the profile of ethnic minorities seem to have good marketing potential in fair trade \nmarkets in industrialized countries, where groups of consumers are willing to support alternative \nincome-generating  opportunities  for  socially  marginalized  population  and  to  save  their \nindigenous culture. New marketing channels for such traditional products of ethnic minorities \nhave emerged with the fair trade movement and alternative trading networks in Europe, Japan, \nand North America. In the Lao PDR there are a few precedents of small farmers accessing such \n                                                 \n8  Some contracts allow farmers to sell the products in local markets when the market price is higher than the contract \nprice, in which case agroprocessors collect fees from contracted farmers to cover relevant input and extension \ncosts. \n9 Despite the absence of established legal procedures to enforce contracts in the country, contracts have been \nhonored  successfully  through  the  long-term  business  linkage  established  between  socially  responsible \nagroprocessing enterprises and committed rural farmers. \n10  Bingen,  J.  2000.  Producer  Groups:  Becoming  Full  Partners  in  Agricultural  Markets  and  Agro-Enterprises. \nWashington, D.C.  \n11 Upland ethnic minorities in general have the advantage of indigenous knowledge of organic agriculture production, \nwhich is free from use of harmful chemicals or pesticides. ", "4   \nniche markets. Past fair trade activities found that the establishment of long-term business \nrelationships provides lasting economic value to poor farmers far beyond the duration of a \ntraditional income generation program. Fair trade activities have been instrumental in generating \nsustainable alternative income for poor and socially marginalized populations by developing \nproducts  building  on  local  traditions  and  natural  material,  enhancing  poor  producers\u2019  own \nabilities, offering continuous purchase orders and fair prices that ensure productive wages, and \neducating consumers.  \n \n8.  To initiate the establishment of business linkage for ethnic minority farmers with fair \ntrade markets, assistance is required in (i)  product development to meet relevant regulations \nand the product specifications that are on demand in the target markets; (ii) production group \ndevelopment to collectively produce items for a certain number of standardized products, and \n(iii) required literacy and numeracy training for ethnic minority farmers to plan and manage \norder-based production. While the progress of infrastructure development in the country is being \nmade, remoteness and consequential difficulties in logistics and transport arrangements should \nbe overcome by developing efficient local distribution networks. Further, to minimize relevant \ntransaction costs and sustain such business linkages, systematic export administration needs to \nbe in place at border crossings, where effective monitoring and supervision of the state is \nextremely crucial. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The Project aims to generate alternative income-generating opportunities for ethnic \nminority farmers in rural villages by addressing their primary marketing constraints. The outputs \ninclude (i) establishment of production groups among ethnic minority villagers and development \nof the groups\u2019 trade linkages with fair trade markets; (ii) increased production of crops that have \nidentified  markets  under  contract-farming  arrangements  for  ethnic  minority  farmers,  and \nidentification of alternative markets for agroforestry products through market studies, sample \nproduct development, organic farming promotion and product certification; and (iii) evaluation of \nthe development impacts of the project activities. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.   The project activities will focus on marketing and related support for creating business \nlinkages between selected poor ethnic minority communities and identified alternative markets, \nand aim to fill in the technical, managerial, and social shortfalls to complete every stage of the \nconcerned value chain from production through sales for each selected product. The project will \ncomprise three components: (i) production grouping and developing business linkage to fair \ntrade markets (component A); (ii) expanding contract-farming arrangements, which will secure \ncontinuous income-earning opportunities over the long term (component B), and (iii) evaluating \ndevelopment impact (component C). Ethnic minority communities will be selected based on (i) \npoverty status of potential beneficiaries, (ii) willingness to participate in the project activities over \nthe long term, (iii) marketability of their skills and knowledge of NTFP and handicraft production, \nand (iv) expected development impacts.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $706,000  equivalent,  of  which  $600,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the PRF. The TA will be administered by ADB. \nThe  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  about  $106,000  equivalent  by  providing  ", "    5 \ncounterpart  staff  support,  office  accommodation,  and  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings. \nDetailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Secretariat of the National Steering Committee for Commodity Production (NSCCP) \nof the Ministry of Commerce will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the Project and provide all \nrequired support. A qualified project coordinator from NSCCP will be appointed to monitor and \nprovide support for project implementation. Relevant provincial governments will appoint project \nmanagers  to  provide  support  and  coordination  assistance  for  project  implementation  as \nrequired.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years, commencing in October 2004, and will require \nabout 36 person-months of consulting services: 12 international and 24 domestic. A fair trade \norganization (FTO) with adequate experience in fair trade transactions and established sales \nnetwork in fair trade markets will implement component A in association with local community-\nbased organizations. The Friend of the Upland Farmer Corporation (FOUF), an agroprocessor \nthat develops contract farming with upland farmers in the country, will be directly selected to \nundertake component B. FOUF is a socially responsible commercial entity, which aims to \nprovide alternative income-earning opportunities for vulnerable and marginalized social groups \nby engaging them in commercial agricultural production and trade activities. Having developed \nextensive marketing networks, FOUF is capable of effectively facilitating the development of \nmarketable products and identification of long-term buyers of the products, and providing inputs \nin kind to beneficiaries. An FTO will be selected based on ADB\u2019s quality-based selection \nprocedure, and both shortlisted FTOs and FOUF will submit simplified technical proposals. In \naddition, an individual consultant will be recruited for implementing component C in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor engaging domestic consultants. The outline terms of reference for consulting services are in \nAppendix 3. All equipment and services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  using  a  participatory  approach  involving  all  major \nstakeholders. The project activities will be developed based on adequate consultations with \nrelevant government agencies, private distributors, exporters, and potential beneficiaries. With \ndue consideration for their traditions and preferences, ethnic minority villagers will be carefully \nconsulted before planning project activities.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof the Lao People's Democratic Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund for the Marketing Support for Organic Produce of Ethnic Minorities \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
