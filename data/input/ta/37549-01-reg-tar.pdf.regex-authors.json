INTRODUCTION \n1.  In line with the key operational objectives1 of the Regional Cooperation Strategy and \nProgram for South Asia (2006\u20132008),2 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported \nregional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC),3 \ninterregional cooperation through the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and \nEconomic  Cooperation  (BIMSTEC),4 and  subregional  cooperation  through  the  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation Program.5  \n \n2.  The  High  Level  Forum  on  Emerging  Vision  for  Shared  Prosperity:  South  Asia  and \nBeyond (the forum) was held in ADB on 16\u201317 April 2009 to discuss country and regional \nvisions and priorities and to deliberate on possible approaches to, and an operational framework \nfor,  supporting  regional  cooperation.  Secretaries  and  senior  officials  from  the  ministries  of \nfinance and foreign affairs of South Asian countries and their neighbors, as well as senior \nofficials from the SAARC Secretariat, participated in the forum. The forum recognized the \nimportance of a flexible, pragmatic, multi-track approach to advancing regional cooperation in \nSouth Asia with a focus on fast-tracking the implementation of tangible regional investment \nprojects. The forum identified options through which ADB could support regional cooperation in \nSouth Asia and beyond, including (i) regional and interregional projects, (ii) subregional projects \ninvolving more than two countries, and (iii) bilateral projects.  \n \n3.  Following  the  forum,  ADB  held  consultations  with  the  governments  of  South  Asian \ncountries to discuss (i) the process and operational framework for developing and implementing \nregional and subregional projects, (ii) potential priority regional projects, and (iii) the scope of \nthis regional technical assistance (TA). During these meetings, governments expressed general \nsupport for the TA.6   \n \n4.  As suggested by the forum, the TA will adopt a flexible approach that can support \nregional, interregional, subregional, and bilateral projects in which South Asian countries and \ntheir neighbors participate. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.7  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  South Asia has posted strong economic growth in recent years and increased its share \nof world output from 4.5% in 1998 to 6% in 2008.8 However, South Asia is not only the region \nwith the largest number of people living below the poverty line, it is also the least integrated \nregion in Asia, with an intra-regional trade share in 2008 of only 5.5%, compared to 27.1% \n                                                 \n1  The five key operational objectives are to (i) improve connectivity, (ii) facilitate trade and investment, (iii) develop \nregional tourism, (iv) facilitate cooperation in energy, and (v) promote private sector cooperation. \n2  ADB. 2006.

The change in TA title followed the recommendations of \nthe forum to adopt a more flexible, project-based approach to advancing regional cooperation in South Asia and \nbeyond. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 October 2009. \n8  Source: By Purchasing Power Parity. World Bank. World Development Indicators Online.  \n ", "2   \nrecorded by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.9 Further, recent uncertainties caused \nby various shocks including climate change, the spike in food prices, volatile energy prices, and \nthe global economic crisis have challenged the growth potential of South Asia and adversely \naffected the lives of the region's poor. However, the recent shocks and changes in the political \nlandscape provide a window of opportunity for countries in South Asia to renew their efforts to \ndeepen regional cooperation to meet these challenges. Increased regional cooperation in South \nAsia and beyond, particularly increased regional connectivity, would allow for inclusive growth \nby  providing  increased  access  to  markets,  goods,  and  services  across  borders.  Regional \ncooperation can mobilize private investments, counter the impact of declining financial flows, \nand significantly reduce the share of the population living below the poverty line.  \n \n6.  Regional cooperation has recently gained momentum in South Asia. However, while \nregional cooperation initiatives have successfully identified potential regional projects in key \nsectors  such  as  transport  and  trade  facilitation,  energy,  tourism,  and  information  and \ncommunication technology, the implementation of tangible regional projects has been limited. \nThere is growing recognition of the need to realign regional projects with national programs as \ncountries determine national priorities with greater focus and prioritize and implement regional \nprojects.  \n \n7.  Discussing the benefits of regional cooperation and effectively disseminating the findings \nof regional studies can help increase official and public awareness and support for regional \ncooperation initiatives in South Asia. Knowledge management can effectively spur development \npartner and private sector interest and involvement in contributing more significantly toward \nfunding regional projects. \n \n8.  ADB-supported regional cooperation initiatives in South Asia have (i) identified priority \nregional  investments,  including  a  number  of  subregional  pilot  projects  to  improve  regional \nconnectivity (through the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study); (ii) proposed a policy \nframework for BIMSTEC transport and logistics, strategies, and an implementing mechanism to \nenhance  transport  infrastructure,  improve  logistics,  and  lower  transport  costs  (BIMSTEC \nTransport  Infrastructure  and  Logistics  Study);  and  (iii)  identified  subregional  projects  in \ninformation and communication technology, transport and trade facilitation, and tourism  through \nthe South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program. Over and above these regional \ninitiatives, countries have, through country programming, identified and implemented national \nprojects that have strong regional potential. Hence, a rich pool of potential regional investment \nprojects already exists that, once implemented, can bring enormous benefits to communities \nand countries in South Asia.   \n \n9.  In line with ADB's commitment of allocating at least 30% of its operations to regional \ncooperation by 2020 (under ADB's Strategy 202010), this TA will support participating countries \nand regional organizations11 in further identifying, prioritizing, and preparing regional projects \nand national projects with regional implications, with the aim of promoting regional economic \ncooperation  and  economic  activity  among  South  Asian  countries.  The  TA  will  fully  utilize \nexperiences and lessons from subregional initiatives and other regional cooperation initiatives \nand activities supported by ADB. Previous experience with subregional projects in South Asia \nshows that undertaking cross-border and multilateral agreements consumes time and needs to \n                                                 \n9  Source: ADB Asia Regional Integration Center\u2019s Integration Indicators Database.

This TA will involve key ministries, including ministries of finance \nand  foreign  affairs,  as  well  as  other  stakeholders,  at  early  stages  to  ensure  the  smooth \nendorsement and implementation of regional projects and agreements. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is expected to enhance regional economic cooperation in South Asia. This will \nbe gauged by increases in the movement of goods, services, information, and people in South \nAsia. The envisaged outcome is agreed regional cooperation activities and projects.  \n \n11.  The TA will focus on (i) assisting participating countries in identifying and preparing \nregional projects12 and national projects with regional implications, (ii) preparing studies and \npapers to support the formation of a regional cooperation agenda, (iii) providing a venue for \nregional  dialogue,  and  (iv)  developing  regional  capacity  in  formulating  and  implementing \nregional projects and activities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have four components: (i) preparation of regional projects, (ii) awareness \nbuilding, (iii) capacity development, and (iv) technical and logistical support.  The TA is designed \nto  be  flexible  in  order  to  support  regional  projects  agreed  among  participating  countries, \nincluding  projects  identified  under  the  SAARC  and  BIMSTEC  frameworks  and  ongoing \nsubregional initiatives, bilateral projects with regional implications, and national projects with \nregional implications, which will serve as building blocks to wider regional cooperation in South \nAsia. The TA is also flexible in supporting the participation of South Asian countries13  and its \nneighbors in regional projects and activities.  \n \n13.  Preparation of regional projects. Regional technical meetings and workshops will be \norganized to assist participating countries in prioritizing and preparing regional projects and \nnational projects with regional implications in the priority sectors of transport, energy, and trade \nfacilitation, based on the rich pool of potential regional investment projects identified earlier. \nThese meetings can be used to discuss and develop sector road maps as needed. The TA will \nsupport  high-level  forums  of  senior  government  officials  to  be  held  annually  to  facilitate \ndiscussions on strategic directions and to obtain the endorsement of priority regional projects.  \n \n14.  Studies and papers on selected regional cooperation topics will be prepared, with a \nfocus on prefeasibility studies for priority projects. These studies will provide technical and \npolicy advisory inputs to, and support the formulation of, South Asia's regional cooperation \nagenda.  The  studies  and  papers  will  be  designed  in  close  coordination  with  participating \ncountries, regional institutions, think tanks, and other stakeholders.  \n \n15.  Awareness building. Awareness building activities such as regional conferences and \nforums for various stakeholders and policy makers will be organized to provide venues for \nregional dialogue and information exchange. Selected regional studies can be presented and \ndiscussed in these conferences. These activities can help generate wider support for regional \ncooperation in South Asia.  \n                                                 \n12 Including regional, intraregional, and subregional projects.  \n13 South Asian countries are Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.  \n ", "4   \n \n16.  Capacity development. The TA will support capacity development programs that will be \ndesigned  in  close  coordination  with  participating  countries,  key  stakeholders,  and  regional \ninstitutions. Capacity development programs aim to enhance country and regional capacity to \neffectively  formulate  and  implement  regional  projects  and  activities  and  will  be  based  on \nsuccessful training modules of other regional cooperation initiatives. A mix of case studies, \nexperience sharing, on-site visits, and lectures can be used in capacity development. Other \nstakeholders can be invited to participate in training as appropriate.  \n \n17.  Technical and logistical support. Technical and logistical support will be provided in \nADB headquarters and selected resident missions to support the implementation of this TA, \nincluding the organization of regional meetings and forums and the facilitation of coordination \namong  participating  countries.  The  regional  cooperation  advisor  will  prepare  semiannual \nprogress reports to be distributed to participating countries and provide regular updates on the \nstatus of TA implementation.  \n \n18.  Given the multi-country nature of the TA and the complexities of cross-border projects, it \nis important to involve key stakeholders, including ministries of finance and foreign affairs and \nother relevant line agencies, in all stages of the TA implementation. As such, promoting and \nsupporting dialogue with key policy makers from all participating governments and enhancing \nstakeholders\u2019  awareness  of  the  benefits  of  regional  cooperation  are  crucial  to  generating \nsupport for regional cooperation in South Asia as a whole and for this TA in particular. The TA \nwill encourage and facilitate private sector participation as appropriate. The TA is flexible in \nsupporting the participation of South Asian countries and its neighbors in regional projects and \nactivities and will follow SAARC guidelines of engagement where applicable. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA cost is estimated at $1.5 million and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.
