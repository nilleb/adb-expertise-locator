During the 2013 country program mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide technical assistance \n(TA)  to  the  International  Poverty  Reduction  Center  in  China  (IPRCC)  for  Strengthening \nGovernment and Social Organization Cooperation for Rural Poverty Reduction. ADB included \nthe proposed policy and advisory TA in the PRC country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.1 \nADB approved the TA concept paper on 22 May 2014 and undertook a fact-finding mission on \n26  May  2014.  The  mission  reached  agreement  with  the  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact, \noutcome,  outputs,  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over  three  decades  of  rapid  growth  and  poverty  reduction  programming  have \ndramatically reduced rural poverty in the PRC. However, significant challenges remain that call \nfor new responses from the national rural poverty reduction program. 3 \n \n3.  These challenges include a significant number of rural poor\u201482.49 million people, or 8.5% \nof the rural population\u2014still living below the national rural poverty line of CNY2,300 per capita \nper annum at year-end 2013. In addition, frequent return to poverty and impoverishment of \nnear-poor rural households is reported. The causes of rural poverty are also changing rapidly, \nfor  example:  (i)  the  remote  and  harsh  environments  where  many  rural  poor  reside  are \nexperiencing more frequent and severe climatic and other natural disasters; (ii) fragile or high \nbiodiversity environments that have supported the traditional and subsistence needs of the \n(increasingly ethnic minority) poor are under intensifying state restrictions on use; (iii) poor \nresidents now require new skills and resources to engage with expanding and changing markets, \nincluding their opportunities, niches, and challenges; (iv) many villages now have fewer whole \nfamilies but more dependent family members \u201dleft behind\u201d through age, gender, inadequate \neducation or labor capacity as the able-bodied have sought work elsewhere; this has created \nhollowed-out communities with reduced social interaction and residents who need new types of \ntargeted support; and (v) the loss of village-generated revenue has weakened village leadership \nauthority and capacity to convene and coordinate activities and services for the common good. \nIn tandem with these changes, popular awareness of inequality is rising, along with expectations \nthat the poverty reduction program can improve social equity, satisfaction, and stability.  \n \n4.  This changing face of rural poverty means that more diverse approaches to poverty \nreduction are required\u2014e.g., sustained support for poor communities to develop new, or more \neffective, community institutions, management, and income streams. Examples include new \ncooperative or producer groups, green production, and tourism. More accessible and user-\nfriendly information and social services are also necessary, particularly for health, wellness, and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014-2016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 May 2014. \n3  The PRC rural poverty reduction program, the Outline for Development-oriented Poverty Reduction for China\u2019s \nRural Areas (2011\u20132020), was released by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and State \nCouncil of the People\u2019s Republic of China in Beijing in 2011. It designates 592 national poor counties and 231 \ncontiguous counties in 14 poverty blocks in mountainous and arid areas of the central and western PRC as its \nprogramming focus. It calls for development of village poverty reduction plans to increase household and village \nincomes and boost the capacity of communities to contribute to their own development. Specific activities include \nvillage roads, safe drinking water, village electrification, improvement of unsafe housing, specialty production and \nmarketing, village tourism development, and access to education, health, cultural facilities, and communications. \nThe program implementation plan was finalized in early 2013 and approval steps are in progress. \n ", "2 \n \nelderly care. Community capacity for mutual support, management, and maintenance of village \npublic goods needs to be rebuilt, and creation of stronger, more equitable links with distant \ntownship and county government organizations, external support groups, and markets is critical.  \n \n5.  The poverty reduction administration recognizes that its skills and resources, outreach, \ntargeting, and delivery capacity at local level are insufficient to solve these new challenges. This \nhas stimulated debate on whether social organizations could be engaged in poverty reduction to \nhelp overcome these deficiencies.4  Growing government interest in this possibility was stirred \nby several recent developments. Disaster relief work following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake \nprovided unprecedented and unanticipated evidence of the capacity of social organizations to \nsupport village recovery and service provision. Experienced and technically proficient social \norganizations used their local position, knowledge, and resources to rapidly connect with, and \nassist, residents. They also generated funds for community activities and employed participatory \nand transparent approaches for activity identification and fund tracking. Their facilitation skills \nalso  helped  create  more  inclusive  and  sustained  community  management  structures.  This \nresulted in relatively high rates of villager satisfaction and social cohesion. Secondly, social \norganizations  in  the  PRC  are  rapidly  growing  in  numbers  and  command  significant \norganizational, financial, and volunteer resources.5 This reflects public perception that social \norganizations are increasingly effective in channeling funding to vulnerable groups, helping \nreduce poverty, and promoting concepts and values of charity. Thirdly, some trial engagement \nof social organizations in the national poverty reduction program has already occurred. ADB and \nthe  Ford  Foundation  each  supported  a  small-scale  experiment  of  contracting  for  service \nprovision from 2005.6 In 2011, the national rural poverty reduction program itself recommended \n\u201cengaging all sectors of society and expand\uf05bing] areas of social cooperation in order to raise the \nstandard, and ensure the effectiveness, of poverty reduction programming.\u201d This was reiterated \nby the PRC Premier in early 2014 when he called for \u201cguid\uf05bing] nongovernmental forces to \nparticipate in poverty alleviation\u201d and encouraging \u201csocial organizations to play a bigger role in \ndelivering public services and exercising social governance.\u201d This sentiment reflected wider \nnational reforms that aim to transform the role of the state, society, and market in service \ndelivery. \n \n6.  However, these developments have been insufficient to build deeper agency awareness \nand broader collaboration with social organizations. Instead, debate and doubt has continued \nover two issues: (i) whether social organizations have, or could develop, sufficient numbers, \ncoverage,  capacity,  and  interest  to  systematically  provide  services  to  the  village  poverty \nreduction program, and (ii) how their existing and improving capacities and contributions should \nbe fostered, regulated, and recognized by contracting agencies. Are there relevant lessons from \n                                                \n4  Social organizations are officially defined as \u201cnot-for-profit organizations that are formed voluntarily by Chinese \ncitizens in order to realize the shared objectives of their members, carrying out activities in accordance with their \ncharter.\u201d (People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 1998. Regulations on the Registration and Administration of \nSocial Organizations. Beijing). \n5  There were 541,000 social organizations at year-end 2013, an increase of 8.4% over 2012. Moreover, 29% of \nthese organizations are self-identified as working in poverty reduction and social development in 2012. The \nMinistry of Civil Affairs estimated that in 2013, around 80 million people, or 7% of the PRC population, engaged in \nvarious types of voluntary service, with an imputed value estimated at CNY1.1 billion. Total public donations \nexceeded CNY110 billion in 2013. \n6  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Nongovernment Organization\u2013Government \nPartnerships in Village-Level Poverty Alleviation. Manila. This TA explored local government contracting of local \nand non-local social organizations to provide poverty reduction services in four counties of Jiangxi Province in the \ncentral PRC. Ford Foundation grant 1055-1019 \u201cTo design, demonstrate and disseminate replicable mechanisms \nfor nongovernment organization management of government-funded village participatory poverty reduction plans\u201d \nsupported pilot contracting of local social organizations in five sites of four provinces in the western PRC.  \n ", "3 \n \ninternational experience of service delivery by social organizations? These questions form the \nfocus of this TA.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the project will be an enabling environment for social organizations to \ncontract rural poverty reduction services. Performance indicators will include (i) existence of \nactive and updated government administrative guidelines for contracting rural poverty reduction \nservices from social organizations at all relevant administrative levels; (ii) increased funding \nexpended for government contracting of social organization services within the rural poverty \nreduction program by geographic area, types of activities, and social organizations; and (iii) \ngrowth and improved distribution of contracted provision of rural poverty reduction program \nservices. This will include gender-sensitive data on contracts signed, characteristics, location, \nand numbers of contracting social organizations, and the nature of services contracted. The \noutcome  will  be  that  government  meets  social  organizations\u2019  needs  and  strengthens  their \ncapacity to contract poverty reduction services. Performance indicators will include (i) increased \nexpression of support from all levels of the poverty reduction leadership, and (ii) provision of \ngender-sensitive workshops, gender-sensitive training, and information by the national poverty \nreduction administration (including the executing agency) to solicit social organization feedback \nand improve stakeholder capacity to contract program services. Executing agency workshops, \ntraining, and information for social organizations are new activities and provide an opportunity to \nboost awareness of gender issues within the rural poverty reduction program and to guide \nparticipants in preparing more gender-sensitive activities i.e., those that recognize, respect, and \nrespond to gender-based needs and rights.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will have four linked and phased outputs in areas selected from the 14 poverty \nblocks designated under the national rural poverty reduction plan as outlined below. Output 1 \nwill  involve  a  desk-based  policy  analysis  of  the  PRC  government\u2013social  organization \ncooperation\u2014e.g., procurement of rural poverty reduction services from social organizations\u2014\nand identification of good international practices. Initial findings will be reviewed in stakeholder \nworkshops to inform the in-depth data collection in output 2. Output 2 will comprehensively \nassess  the  capacity  of  social  organizations  to  contract  for  gender-sensitive  rural  poverty \nreduction services through conducting multi-province surveys, in-depth field interviews, and data \ncollection  in  the  western,  central,  and  eastern  PRC.  A  gender-sensitive  database  will  be \nassembled on numbers, character, distribution, capacity, and activities of social organizations \nengaged  in  rural  poverty  reduction  and  their  interests  and  needs,  along  with  those  of \ngovernment poverty reduction agencies, for contracting poverty reduction services under the \nnational rural poverty reduction program. Case studies will be developed to highlight important \nexperiences and also the skills, approaches, and benefits that social organizations can bring to \nrural poverty reduction. Output 3 will draw on output 1 and 2 activities to prepare suggested \nadministrative and training guidelines for key local government members and staff of social \norganizations engaged in contracting poverty reduction services. Output 4 will draw on all three \nearlier outputs to provide policy recommendations for improved and expanded contracting of \nsocial  organization  services  in  the  national  rural  poverty  reduction  program  funded  by \ngovernment (and potentially including contributions from international donors), and to exchange \nexperience and lessons in an international workshop and otherwise disseminate TA knowledge.  \n ", "4 \n \n9.  The TA will produce (i) a bilingual policy brief with main findings, recommendations, and \ndissemination strategy; (ii) a final report on government support to build social organization \ncapacity to contract poverty reduction program services with actionable recommendations; (iii) a \ntechnical section of the final report on contracting of social organizations to provide services \nunder the government's rural poverty reduction program; (iv) a compilation of domestic and \ninternational  case  studies  on  social  organization  provision  of  contracted  poverty  reduction \nservices;  and  (v) associated  survey  instruments,  data  sets,  administrative  and  training \nguidelines or manuals to help improve contracting of social organizations for the provision of \nrural poverty reduction services. Dissemination of research findings and policy suggestions \nwould occur through stakeholder meetings, bilingual reports, and knowledge products.7  A plan \nfor effective dissemination for policy impact will also be formulated.  \n \n10.  Key assumptions of the TA are that (i) government contractors perceive value, and are \nwilling to invest resources to develop the capacity of social organizations to meet government \nand  community  requirements  for  effective  service  delivery;  this  includes  methods  for \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  less  experienced  social  organizations;  (ii)  local  government \ncontractors are willing and able to allocate agency funds and resources to carry out fair and \ntransparent identification, engagement, and evaluation of social organization capacities and \ncontributions; and (iii) sufficient local  social organizations are capable of and interested  in \nproviding services to standards and methodologies that satisfy government contractors and \nsocial organization suppliers.  \n \n11.  TA risks include (i) the speed of government policy change superseding the TA study \nand recommendations\u2014the TA will aim to minimize this risk by scoping the relevant government \npolicy agenda and timeframe, tracking the related policy environment, and disseminating interim \nTA findings and updates to key stakeholders; (ii) hasty scheme implementation or expansion \nresulting in poor-quality outcomes and overall loss of confidence in the scheme\u2014the TA will \nseek to minimize this risk by documenting relevant scenarios or examples in presentations, \nreports, and training materials; (iii) local government contracting (mis)targeting and accrediting \nonly  a  narrow  range  of  social  organizations,  including  those  erroneously  established  by \ncontractor  agencies,  creating  supplier  disinterest  or  distrust  in  governance  processes  and \ntransparency\u2014the TA will aim to minimize this risk by specifying and clarifying acceptable \nidentification processes; the executing agency would then spot-check on these within its regular \nprocedures; and (iv) unanticipated changes in the functions and funding of the village poverty \nreduction program or agencies\u2014the TA will aim to minimize this risk by stressing the benefits of \npolicy and planning stability for policy and local leader achievements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, their remuneration and per diem, \noffice space, office supplies, relevant data and information, and other in-kind contributions. \n                                                \n7  For example, the Technical Assistance for Supporting the Operationalization of Community-Driven Development in \nDeveloping Member Countries (approved in 2013) would host a community-driven development learning exchange \nworkshop in the Philippines for selected developing member country representatives to discuss community-driven \ndevelopment initiatives in selected countries. The mission leader of the Technical Assistance for Cooperation \nBetween Government and Social Organizations for Rural Poverty Reduction would assist the mission leader of the \nTechnical Assistance for Supporting the Operationalization of Community-Driven Development in Developing \nMember Countries to identify the PRC counterparts and share outputs of this TA. \n \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 21 months, from 1 August 2014 to 1 May 2016. The \nIPRCC is the executing agency and its Department of Research is the implementing agency.  \n \n14.     The TA requires 34 person-months of consulting services from four individual national \nconsultants. An expert on social organization policies (12 person-months) will act as team \nleader and take overall responsibility for organizing the survey design, fieldwork plan, and \nsurvey  implementation,  and  completing  the  bilingual  policy  brief  and  final  project  report \n(including sections on social organization policies). A social survey and analysis specialist (8 \nperson-months) will work with team members to design the survey questionnaire and take \nresponsibility for data entry, analysis, formatting, and presentation of the final database. A rural \npoverty programming and institutions specialist (8 person-months) will analyze the content and \ntasks of the government poverty reduction program and roles that social organizations could \nassume in this context, and assess capacity needs and potential difficulties. A participatory rural \npoverty reduction and social organization training specialist (6 person-months) will conduct a \ncapacity  and  training  needs  assessment  of  government  agencies  and  social  organizations \ninterested in the contracting of services; produce a final training framework and guideline or \nmanual, and assist the case studies.  \n \n15.       In  dialogue  with  the  executing  agency,  ADB  will  recruit  four  individual  national \nconsultants and additional short-term resource persons in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in accordance with the  Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). To facilitate implementation, ADB may establish an advance \npayment facility for IPRCC to support certain agreed cash expenditures, including workshops, \nsurveys and administrative costs, with details of the proposed activities, including cost estimates, \nsubmitted through the executing agency to ADB for approval.  \n \n16.  IPRCC will (i) designate a TA focal point to review reports and coordinate activities and \nin-kind contributions; and (ii) explore a short overseas learning visit for a staff member, e.g., in \nthe Philippines to study international experience of government-contracted social services. \n \n17.  The TA will have project-specific indicators and targets, including timely implementation, \nprogress  reporting,  and  periodic  deliverables.  Policy  and  stakeholder  dialogue  will  be \nmaintained with relevant government agencies, social organizations, and stakeholder groups to \nensure  field-level  feedback  and  policy  relevance.  TA  interim  and  final  reports  and  other \ndeliverables  will  be  reviewed  and  discussed  by  the  executing  agency,  ADB,  and  other \nstakeholders in terms of progress and quality. TA good practices, manuals, and other materials \nwill be provided during TA workshops and on existing executing agency, stakeholder, and ADB \nwebsites. TA outputs and outcome evaluation will be disseminated widely through stakeholder \nmeetings, bilingual reports, and knowledge products. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Strengthening Government and Social \nOrganization Cooperation for Rural Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nAn enabling  Active and updated  New documents  The rural poverty \nenvironment for  government administrative  circulated and available  reduction program \nsocial organizations  guidelines for contracting  at each relevant  maintains its focus, \nto contract rural  rural poverty reduction  administrative level  funding, resources, and \npoverty reduction  services from social  institutional structures. \nservices   organizations exist at all   \n  relevant administrative   \nlevels by 2020   \n    Willingness and ability \nIncreased funding  Periodic, published  of the rural poverty \nexpended for government  executing agency survey  reduction administration \ncontracting of social  reports on status and  to undertake fair and \norganizations services  change in  contracted  transparent selection, \nwithin the rural poverty  provision of poverty  employment, and \nreduction program by  reduction program  evaluation of social \ngeographic area, types of  services  organizations capacities \nactivities, and social  and contributions \norganizations compared   \nwith the base year of 2014 \n      Risks           \nGrowth and improved  Unanticipated major \ndistribution of contracted  refocusing of the \nprovision of rural poverty  national poverty \nreduction program services,  reduction mandate, \nincluding gender-sensitive  administration, and \ndata on contracts signed,  resources \nnumber, location, and \nMajor instance(s) of \ncharacteristics of \nmisconduct in \ncontracting social \ncontracted activities \norganizations, and nature of \nlead to loss of \nservices contracted \nstakeholder confidence \ncompared with the 2014 \nand curtail(s) overall \nsurvey baseline  \nprogram operation. \nOutcome        Assumptions \nGovernment meets  Increased expression of  Quantity and content of  TA has identified \nsocial organizations\u2019  support from all levels of the  leadership speeches,  sufficient social \nneeds and  poverty reduction leadership  agency, and media  organizations interested \nstrengthens their  for social organizations  reports   in, and meeting, poverty \ncapacity  to contract  contracting of government  reduction agency \npoverty reduction  rural poverty reduction  requirements, plus \nservices   services compared with the  effective means for \n  2014 survey baseline  strengthening capacity \nof newer entrants.  \n ", "Appendix 1   7 \n \nDesign   Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks  \n    Risks               \nFrom 2016, the national  Executing agency  Hasty scheme \npoverty reduction  reports, publicity among  implementation or \nadministration (including  stakeholder groups,  expansion leads to poor \nthe executing agency) is  training, and information  quality outcomes  and \nproviding gender-sensitive  materials                             overall loss of \nworkshops,  training, and    confidence in scheme; \ninformation provision to                                              Instances of non- \nbuild capacity of local  transparent or \ngovernment poverty  formalistic selection or \nreduction agencies and  accreditation lead to \nsocial organizations to  social organization \ncontract program services   disinterest or distrust \nOutputs  Final report on government  Consultants\u2019 monthly  Assumptions \n1.
