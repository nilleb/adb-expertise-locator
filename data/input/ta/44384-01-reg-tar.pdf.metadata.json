INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) was established in 1993 by \nthe United Nations Development Programme and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to \nassist economic growth and development in Pacific island countries.1 Since then, PFTAC has \nprovided  support  in  four  key  areas:  (i)  public  financial  management,  (ii)  tax  policy  and \nadministration, (iii) banking regulation and supervision, and (iv) economic and financial statistics. \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) is consistent with the Pacific Approach 2010\u201320142 of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), which identifies continued support for good governance and \nregional cooperation and integration activities. ADB\u2019s Pacific Regional Operations Business \nPlan provides for continued ADB support for PFTAC, with a $1 million contribution over 3 \nyears.3 PFTAC support complements other technical assistance (TA) projects undertaken in the \nregion by ADB in the areas of public financial management,4 economic management,5 and \nexternal audit.6 ADB continues to work closely with PFTAC to avoid duplication and overlap in \nactivities, while providing comprehensive support to Pacific island countries in these areas. \n \n3.  Since 1994 ADB has provided a total of $5.4 million to PFTAC under nine consecutive \nregional TA projects complementing other development partners\u2019 support to PFTAC. The most \nrecent support provided was for 2008\u20132011.7 The continued funding by ADB has been based \non PFTAC\u2019s successful track record and ability to deliver timely, high-quality, cost-effective \ntechnical advice to Pacific DMCs, along with a number of successful capacity development \nprograms. In addition, PFTAC increases efficiency through pooling of resources from a number \nof development partners, and by providing a one-stop-shop for technical specialized economic \nand financial advisory services in the Pacific. \n \n4.  During the most recent meeting of the Tripartite Review Committee (TRC)8 in September \n2010, PFTAC presented its strategy for the fourth financing cycle covering 2011\u20132016.9 The \nstrategy  was  developed  by  PFTAC  after  consultations  with  the  representatives  of  various \ninstitutions  of  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  and  development  partners, \nincluding ADB. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Despite  continued  reform  efforts  and  some  successful  implementation,  weaknesses \nremain in financial and economic management in Pacific DMCs due to institutional capacity \nconstraints  and  lack  of  adequate  technical  skills.  These  weaknesses  have  become  more \napparent as a result of the global financial and economic crisis, which adversely affected Pacific \nisland economies through falling tourist numbers, a reduction in exports, and reduced foreign \nremittances. Macroeconomic policy failures, weak revenue structures, limited private sector \n                                                \n1  PFTAC member countries are Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, \nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Draft Program Document for the Fourth Financing Cycle. Suva. \n ", "2   \ndevelopment, and weak public financial management have all been identified as significant \ncontributing factors. Capacity remains a compelling problem for the region due to the small size \nof public administrations, reliance on a small number of qualified individuals, and the ease of \nout-migration. \n \n6.  A number of independent reviews have concluded that PFTAC has been successful due \nto its positioning within the region, responsiveness, and ability to fill a niche that cannot be \nreadily filled by other TA projects.10 The most recent review noted that PFTAC delivers high \nquality, effective and efficient services to Pacific DMCs and its performance was rated as good. \nThe two most frequently cited factors contributing to PFTAC\u2019s success were its location in the \nregion and the high quality of its expertise. Other reasons included PFTAC\u2019s responsiveness to \ngovernment priorities, consistent engagement over a period of years, personal relationships with \nPacific DMCs, and knowledge of its member countries. Due to this, the work of PFTAC has \nbeen well received by Pacific DMCs, particularly in diagnosing the challenges and supporting \nthe development of reform strategies. PFTAC continues to deliver training, workshops and \nattachments on a regional and subregional level. The training is also well received by Pacific \nDMCs who have rated highly the quality of resource persons, topics covered and presentations. \n \n7.  In  general,  PFTAC  activities  have  had  political  and  management  support  of  the \nbeneficiary agencies, and therefore have yielded positive changes in policies and procedures \nthat have become institutionalized. One area where PFTAC has been particularly successful in \nensuring sustainable capacity is the development and ongoing support for regional professional \nassociations such as the Pacific Islands Financial Managers Association and the Pacific Islands \nTax Administrators Association. \n \n8.  Since 2008, PFTAC has sought additional resources to expand its activities and has \nincreased  the  number  of  resident  advisors  from  four  to  five  with  the  addition  of  one \nmacroeconomic  advisor.  PFTAC\u2019s  draft  program  document  for  the  fourth  financing  cycle \nproposes further increases in resident advisors as PFTAC seeks to broaden its activities in \nstatistics and public financial management, with an additional advisor to be appointed in each of \nthese  areas.  In  statistics,  and  economic  statistics  in  particular,  the  Pacific  remains \nunderdeveloped\u2014only four countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Tonga, and Vanuatu) have subscribed to the \nIMF\u2019s General Data Dissemination System and none currently are close to the Special Data \nDissemination Standard.12 In public financial management, the additional advisor will focus on \nsupporting the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment process, \nwhich has been given increased emphasis through the public financial management road map \napproved by Pacific Forum Leaders and Finance Ministers in 2010.13 \n \n9.  PFTAC will, in the new funding cycle, continue to be a source of high quality assistance \nthat is provided in a flexible and responsive manner that meets the important needs of its \nmembers. There continues to be a strong need and an equally strong demand for the activities \nand support provided by PFTAC. The focus of PFTAC\u2019s work will continue to be on building \ncapacity, in collaboration with other TA providers, in order to improve the skills and institutional \ncapacities of members and strengthen the implementation of reform programs. \n \n                                                \n10 The most recent review was IMF. 2009.

The TA will continue ADB\u2019s support of PFTAC through 2011\u20132014. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be for Pacific island countries to achieve economic and financial policy \nobjectives to contribute to sustainable economic growth. The outcome will be strengthened \ninstitutional and human resource capacity of Pacific island countries\u2019 finance ministries and \ncentral banks to improve economic and financial management in Pacific island countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will deliver outputs in line with PFTAC\u2019s key areas of advisory services and \ncapacity building activities over the TA period (2011\u20132014). The outputs reflect all activities \nproposed by PFTAC (consistent with prior financing cycles, ADB and development partner \nfunds, as with earlier TAs, are pooled and managed by the IMF). \n \n13.  The outputs (and associated activities) are: \n \n(i)  Public  financial  management  strengthened.  Activities  in  public  financial \nmanagement will be focused around the regional public financial management \nroadmap and will be focused in two areas (i) supporting the PEFA assessment \nprocess and development of realistic reform priorities; and (ii) continued hands-\non technical support and training in specific reform areas, which are expected to \ninclude  improved  legal  frameworks,  budgeting  cycles,  cash  management, \ncommitment expenditure controls and accounting processes and procedures. \n \n(ii)  Revenue  systems  developed  to  be  more  broadly-based  and  efficient. \nAdopting the model tax office developed through the regional tax administrators \nassociation, PFTAC will assess and monitor the national tax administrations of \nPacific island countries against the regional benchmark. Priorities are expected \nto be value-added tax implementation, compliance strategies, and information \ntechnology strategies. PFTAC will continue to support the Oceania Customs \nOrganization, focusing mainly on enhancing information technology and updating \nlegislation.  Given  fiscal  adjustment  pressures  facing  many  Pacific  island \ncountries, tax policy assistance is also expected to be a high priority in the early \npart of the funding cycle. \n \n(iii)  Identified financial system risk factors addressed and minimized. PFTAC \nwill  continue  to  assist  in  the  development  of  appropriate  regulations  and \nstatistical returns and the regular production of financial soundness indicators. \nThe focus of support is expected to move towards building capacity for on-site \nexamination, in particular analysis of asset quality and the implications for the \nadequacy  of  bank  capital  and  earning  performance.  Assistance  in  non-bank \nsupervision  will  continue  to  be  provided.  PFTAC  expects  the  Australian \nPrudential Regulation Authority to take a lead in this area, but will also provide \nassistance, particularly with respect to insurance and provident funds. \n   \n ", "4   \n \n(iv)  More  timely  and  reliable  economic  statistics. PFTAC\u2019s support to Pacific \nisland countries\u2019 statistics will take place in the context of the regional statistical \nbenchmarking study and its implementation plan. National accounts statistics will \nbe the main focus of the first resident advisor, with the second advisor initially \nfocusing on external statistics. The emphasis of the second advisor will change \nduring the cycle, depending on regional priorities. The advisor will coordinate \nclosely with the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, which will have a large \nprogram of support focused on producing source data vital for improvement of \nmacroeconomic statistics. \n \n(v)  Improved  macroeconomic  analysis.  The  advisor  will  focus  on  improving \nmacroeconomic  forecasting,  strengthening  the  framework  for  inter-agency \ncoordination,  building  in-country  capacity  for  debt  sustainability  analysis, \nincreasing the use of financial programming techniques (particularly in countries \nfacing a substantial short-term adjustment need), and developing more effective \nmonetary and exchange rate frameworks. The advisor\u2019s work will be closely \ncoordinated  with  IMF  surveillance,  in  particular  through  IMF\u2019s  new  regional \nrepresentative, and other development partners such as ADB that are involved in \nregional monitoring and analysis. \n \n14.  These outputs are described in detail in the strategy document for the fourth financing \ncycle (footnote 8). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent and will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and administered by the \nIMF. The total cost of operating PFTAC14 is to be jointly funded with the European Union,15 the \nIMF, and the governments of Australia, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. The IMF has \ncommitted $2.7 million while the remaining development partners are in the process of finalizing \ntheir funding commitments. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The  IMF  is  the  executing  agency  and  PFTAC  is  the  implementing  agency.  The \narrangements for the funding of PFTAC will be consistent with the requirements established \nunder all previous TA projects. ADB\u2019s funds will be pooled with those from other development \npartners and managed by the IMF. \n \n17.  On approval of the TA, the IMF will provide ADB with a letter of understanding that \ngoverns ADB\u2019s contribution towards PFTAC activities. The IMF is responsible for PFTAC\u2019s \nmanagerial, technical, and administrative arrangements along with the relevance and quality of \nPFTAC assistance. The IMF (i) assigns the coordinator of the center, (ii) selects the resident \nadvisors from their professional staff, (iii) hires short-term experts using IMF procedures and \n                                                \n14 PFTAC\u2019s strategy for the fourth financing cycle contains two options (i) a proposed expansion of PFTAC activities \nwith a corresponding increase in costs, for an estimated total of $30 million over 5 years; and (ii) maintaining the \ncurrent scope of operations over the 5 years for an estimated total of $22 million. The outcome of the current fourth \nfunding cycle will influence the option taken. Governments of recipient countries have been asked to make a \ncontribution to the fourth financing cycle. \n15 The European Union is a new contributor to PFTAC under the fourth funding cycle. \n ", "  5 \ndraws on experts from its approved rosters, (iv) provides supervision and support services, (v) \nprovides  administrative  support,  and  (vi)  manages  the  cost-sharing  contributions  of  the \ndevelopment  partners.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  three  equal  annual \ninstallments ($333,333 per annum) to PFTAC over the TA period (2011\u20132014). \n \n18.  PFTAC's resident advisors and short-term experts will be recruited and supervised by \nthe IMF in accordance with its standard practices. IMF selection procedures are consistent with \nADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Because \nADB's funds will be pooled with those from other development partners and will be managed by \nthe IMF through the application of the IMF\u2019s policies, it requires ADB Board approval.  \n \n19.  TA activities will be implemented over 36 months, starting in July 2011. The expected \nfinancial completion date of the TA is August 2014. \n \n20.  Monitoring of the TA will draw on the findings of assessments by the IMF. Biannual \nreports will be prepared by the PFTAC coordinator and distributed to all PFTAC contributing \ndevelopment partners detailing progress against an agreed results framework. Strategic and \noperational issues will be monitored at the TRC meeting (held every 18 months). PFTAC also \nmaintains its own website providing regular updates against activity plans and country strategies. \nLessons and good practices will be disseminated throughout the duration of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve, by a vote of directors representing \nnot less than two-thirds of the total voting power of the members, the use of IMF recruitment \nguidelines for the procurement of consultants for the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre 2011-2014. \n \n22.  If the Board approves the proposal in paragraph 21, the President, acting under the \nauthority  delegated  by  the  Board,  will  approve  the  provision  of  technical  assistance  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis for the Pacific Financial Technical \nAssistance Centre 2011-2014. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms    \nImpact      Assumptions \nPacific island countries  Average 0.5 rating  ADB and World Bank  PICs remain committed to \nachieve economic and  improvement by the end of  annual CPA reports  economic and financial \nfinancial policy objectives  2014 in the following relevant  management reforms. \nto contribute to  CPA scores in 9 countries:   \nsustainable economic  (i)  A-1: macroeconomic  Risks \ngrowth.  management  External shocks limit \n(ii)  A-2: fiscal policy  economic growth. \n(iii)  A-3: debt policy \n(iv)  B-5: financial sector \n(v)  D-13: quality of budgetary \nand financial \nmanagement \n(vi)  D-14: efficiency of \nrevenue mobilizationa \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened institutional  Six documented instances in  PFTAC biannual reports  Technical assistance is \nand human resource  each Pacific island country of    provided in the context \ncapacity of Pacific island  PFTAC\u2019s advice being  PFTAC Tripartite Review  of coordinated and \ncountries ministries of  incorporated into economic  Committee meetings  appropriately resourced \nfinance and central banks  and financial management  strategic plans and \nto improve Pacific island  policies and systems.  road maps. \ncountries\u2019 economic and   \nfinancial management.
