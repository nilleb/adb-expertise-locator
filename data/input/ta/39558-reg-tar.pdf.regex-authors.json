In  November  2002,  during  its  first  summit,  the  leadership  of  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion (GMS) expressed a common concern that GMS countries lacked the human capacity \nto meet the challenges of rapid economic growth, including ensuring that it is equitable and \nsustainable,  and  requested  support  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  capacity \nbuilding.  In  response,  in  2002  ADB  launched  the  Phnom  Penh  Plan  for  Development \nManagement  (PPP);  initial  support  totaled  $800,000  over  2  years,1 with  the  objective  of \nproviding continuing, longer-term support for strengthening the capacity of middle and senior-\nlevel officials from the GMS countries for informed policy formulation and enhanced design and \nmanagement of development programs and projects. The New Zealand Agency for International \nDevelopment  (NZAID) 2  provided  additional  support  to  the  program  in  its  first  phase. \nSubsequently, based on the strong endorsement of and demand from the GMS leadership, ADB \napproved a second phase of PPP in March 2005, also for $800,000. NZAID, the Government of \nFrance and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) supported PPP Phase II.3  \n \n2.  The GMS leadership continues to recognize4 PPP as a premier and unique capacity-\nbuilding  program  that  is  making  a  significant  contribution  to  generating  knowledge  and \nenhancing the skills of government officials and policy makers in the GMS; in view of the \nsubstantial unmet needs that exist, the GMS leadership has requested continued support from \nADB  to  extend  PPP,  with  refined  content  and  expanded  scope.  The  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for the third phase has been prepared in response to this request. The TA \nframework is at Appendix 1.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The GMS has experienced rapid economic growth since the early 1990s, fueled by \nadoption of integrative market-oriented economic policies and political stability. In fact, for over a \ndecade the region\u2019s economy has grown at one of the fastest rates globally. ADB\u2019s GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program, initiated in 1992, has contributed to this rapid economic growth \nthrough significant investments in infrastructure. Increased connectivity has given an impetus to \nintraregional  trade  and  contributed  to  expanding  socioeconomic  growth.  However,  despite \ncontinuing favorable economic projections, the GMS faces serious challenges. As the GMS \neconomies become more integrated with the global economy, the pressure to stay competitive \nis  increasing.  In  addition,  rapid  development  is  accompanied  by  the  need  to  ensure  that \ndevelopment is balanced, sustainable, and equitable. The human capacity to manage these \nchallenges will be critical to continued socioeconomic development of the region. There is also a \nstrong demand for knowledge and skills needed to assess the risks and impact of regional \ninitiatives  in  the  GMS,  and  to  establish  complementarities  between  national  and  regional \npolicies. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. GMS Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management. Manila.  \n2  NZAID contributed NZ$500,000 in March 2003. \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management \nII. Manila (TA 6237-REG, approved on 29 March 2005, for $800,000 on a grant basis). Supplementary funding was \nprovided by the NZAID ($850,000), Government of France ($1,923,000) and the PRC\u2019s Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty Reduction Fund ($500,000).  \n4  At the second GMS summit in July 2005 in Kunming, the GMS heads of state lauded the key role of PPP in building \ncapacity in the subregion. Subsequently at the 14th GMS Ministerial Meeting in June 2007 in Manila, the GMS \nministers recognized PPP\u2019s catalytic role in effectively building capacity and enhancing skills of GMS development \nmanagers.  \n5   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 July 2007. \n ", "2   \n4.  The skill requirements among civil servants and policy makers are varied and complex, \nand include cutting-edge sector and thematic knowledge, critical thinking and analysis abilities, \nsharpened  leadership  attributes,  and  modern  management  principles,  among  others.  Two \nadditional factors are essential in meeting the growing, long-term need to improve development \nmanagement in the GMS: (i) strengthened institutional capacity, and (ii) knowledge regarding \ndevelopment issues of relevance to the GMS. Both will be critical to developing the human \ncapacity needed to meet the challenges of a fiercely competitive development environment.  \n \n5.  Over the past 4 years, PPP has supported capacity  building for GMS officials through a \nset  of  carefully  designed  and  targeted  activities:  (i)  custom-designed  programs  for  senior \ngovernment  officials  in  public  policy  and  advanced  executive  development,  (ii)  learning \nprograms  for  middle-level  officials  on  sector  and  thematic  areas  central  to  socioeconomic \ndevelopment, (iii) fellowships for short duration programs at top international universities, and (iv) \nshort and highly focused learning events aimed at the senior echelons of the civil service and a \nwider audience to generate knowledge and awareness of cutting-edge development issues. \nPPP  provides  opportunities  to  its  alumni  for  networking  and  life-long  learning,  and  has \nsupported institutional capacity-building networks comprising institutions within and outside the \nGMS.  \n \n6.  PPP  has  been  designed  to  take  a  layered  approach  to  capacity  building.  Its  top \ndevelopment management program (TDMP) offers highly focused learning opportunities to top-\nranking decision makers in the GMS. TDMPs have been organized to coincide with GMS \nministerial meetings with the objective of enabling knowledge sharing between development \npractitioners and academics and GMS ministers and senior officials. Topics covered in the \nTDMPs include leadership, governance, sustainable development, managing shared resources \nand ecosystem development. Learning programs have focused on subjects of high relevance to \nGMS civil servants and policy makers at both the national and the regional level. Programs \naimed at senior officials are designed to develop strategic leadership and analytical skills related \nto public policy and governance, while programs for middle-level officials provide well structured \ncontent and skills development on key sector and thematic areas, as well as principles of policy \ndesign  and  project  management,  and  aim  to  further  their  understanding  of  development \ninterventions, so as to optimize the benefits and mitigate the risks associated with sectoral \ninitiatives at national and regional levels. Subjects covered include trade, education, tourism, \nenvironment, labor markets and infrastructure development, among others. In Phase II, PPP \nlaunched the distinguished speaker series (DSS) and the GMS development dialogue (GDD). \nThe DSS seeks to bring the knowledge and wisdom of eminent persons who are distinguished \nin their respective fields to policy makers in the GMS, with the goal of broadening horizons, \nchanging mind-sets, and challenging decision makers to make more effective and informed \npolicy choices. The GDD provides a platform for in-depth discussion on issues of significance in \nregional development to enhance capacity for analytical decision making.  \n \n7.  PPP is a key program under the Human Resource Development Strategy of the GMS \nEconomic  Cooperation  Program.  The  GMS  leadership  has  consistently  recognized  PPP\u2019s \ncontribution  to  strengthening  the  human  resource  capability  of  GMS  civil  servants.  PPP\u2019s \ndistinguishing factors include: (i) providing learning programs tailored to the needs of GMS civil \nservants; (ii) integrating the national and regional dimensions of development planning and \nmanagement;  (iii)  identifying  skills  and  subjects  of  the  highest  relevance  to  development \nmanagement; and (iv) adopting a variety of unique and innovative approaches, inputs and \nincentives  to  support  capacity  building.  Given  the  continued  need  and  strong  demand  for \ncapacity building, an extension of PPP is being proposed. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will result in continuing improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of \ndevelopment management in the GMS for sustained socioeconomic development of the region. \nThe  TA  will  build  capacity  of  GMS  government  officials,  strengthen  GMS  institutions,  and \nencourage knowledge generation and dissemination. PPP aims to accomplish this through a \nseries of carefully designed learning activities and networking opportunities for civil servants in \nthe GMS. It is expected that these civil servants will act as catalysts for change, both nationally \nand regionally. The TA will also provide platforms for knowledge sharing and dissemination \nthrough alumni networks, research, and publications.  \n \n9.  The  specific objectives of PPP Phase III are to: (i) strengthen technical, managerial, and \nleadership capacity of civil servants of the GMS, (ii) promote a better understanding of benefits \nand challenges of regional cooperation and foster a collaborative and cooperative spirit, (iii) \nprovide opportunities for life-long learning, (iv) strengthen institutional networks for capacity \nbuilding, (v) support GMS-based research to develop scholarship and generate knowledge, and \n(vi) provide access to GMS-related knowledge and information. Specific outputs will include: (i) \nparticipation  of  600  civil  servants  in  learning  programs;  (ii)  fellowships  for  short  duration \nprograms  at  universities  of  international  repute  for  12  top-performing  alumni  from  learning \nprograms; (iii) a program to support research; (iv) highly focused learning events designed to \nstimulate reflection, debate, and action among GMS stakeholders; (v) lifelong learning and \nnetworking opportunities for PPP alumni; (vi) expansion of the learning resource center (LRC) in \nCambodia and establishment of an LRC in Lao PDR to provide access to information on GMS; \nand (vii) journals and research papers to disseminate information on the GMS and serve as \ncatalysts for further debate and discussion.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  PPP has enjoyed strong support from the GMS leadership and is perceived to be \nfulfilling a long-term need for capacity building. PPP activities have been regularly reviewed and \nimproved upon, based on feedback received from the clients and internal reviews, and in close \ncollaboration with institutional partners. PPP Phase III activities will be implemented based on \ntried  and  tested  methodologies  and  will  continue  to  benefit  from  ongoing  review  and \nimprovements.  \n \n11.  Demand-Driven  and  Custom-Designed  Learning  Programs.  PPP  offers  learning \nprograms that are specifically designed to address the needs and enhance the competencies of \nvarious echelons in the GMS civil service. The topics covered also target the specific needs of \nofficials at different levels. PPP Phase III will thus continue to provide programs aimed at \ndifferent target groups. This includes short, high-impact learning events that will be aimed at \nGMS leadership and a wider set of academics and opinion makers in the GMS. These will be \noffered  through  various  modalities  to  suit  the  target  audience  and  to  capture  appropriate \nopportunities. PPP Phase III will continue designing and delivering learning programs of 1 to 2 \nweeks duration aimed at middle and senior level officials. The programs will cover a set of \ncarefully selected crosscutting themes and sector-specific topics. Based on strong demand from \nmember  countries,  PPP  Phase  III  will  also  pilot  tools  for  analysis  and  skills  development \nprograms for junior officials on selected topics. All learning programs will be designed and \nimplemented using PPP\u2019s well-tested methodologies (e.g., needs assessment, consultation on \ntraining needs with GMS governments, established selection criteria and screening processes, \n ", "4   \nevaluation and audit of programs, quality control mechanisms, and continuous review and \nimprovement). Further, these will be provided through the network of supporting institutions and \nparticipants will be selected based on stringent and transparent criteria. Member countries will \nbe accorded the opportunity for equal representation in the learning programs. PPP Phase III \nwill continue to offer further learning opportunities (of 3 to 6 weeks duration) to exceptional PPP \nPhase III alumni (fellows) at institutions of world repute. Selection of the fellows will be based on \nestablished procedures that include faculty prescreening based on exceptional performance in \nPPP learning programs, written applications and final selection by an internal ADB selection \ncommittee through videoconference. \n \n12.  PPP programs and activities have benefited from ongoing evaluation procedures that \nfeed into the revision and redesign processes. PPP Phase III will supplement these evaluation \nprocesses by undertaking an impact assessment based on consultation workshops with alumni. \nPPP Phase III will also pilot short duration programs for deepening learning among alumni.  \n \n13.  Core of GMS Champions. In Phase II, PPP enhanced the alumni network significantly \nby providing more learning and networking opportunities. PPP Phase III will continue to expand \nand strengthen the alumni program. Through continuing learning and networking opportunities, \nPPP aims to create a network of GMS champions who have the knowledge and competence to \nmanage  national  development  goals  and  maximize  the  benefits  and  mitigate  the  risks  of \nregional cooperation.  \n \n14.  Institutional Networking and Intellectual Capital Development. PPP has developed \na dynamic and evolving network of institutional capacity-building partners, mainly comprising \ninstitutions  from  within  the  GMS  countries,  but  including  institutions  of  international  repute \noutside the subregion. The PPP collaborates with leading universities, organizations, think tanks, \nand networks to secure the highest quality learning programs. Partners in the GMS are selected \nbased  on  their  potential  to  emerge  as  centers  for  building  capacity  for  development \nmanagement in the subregion. Institutions from outside the GMS are selected based on their \nacademic reputation, the relevance of their expertise, and their willingness and ability to design \nand deliver quality programs relevant to the needs of GMS officials. PPP Phase III will continue \nto review, revisit and expand institutional partnerships to strengthen networks and build capacity \nto  support  PPP  activities.  PPP  publishes  the  Journal  for  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \nDevelopment Studies to provide a forum for dissemination of GMS-related research, but both \nknowledge  and  research  about  the  GMS  remain  fragmented.  To  provide  an  impetus  for \nintellectual capital development, PPP Phase III will support GMS-based research through select \ninstitutions  that  have  demonstrated  an  interest  and  capacity  for  research.  Implementation \nguidelines  for  supporting  research  will  be  prepared  and  finalized  in  consultation  with \nparticipating institutions.  \n \n15.  Advocacy,  Outreach,  and Knowledge Sharing. The activities initiated by PPP for \nknowledge sharing will be continued and strengthened. An LRC was established in Phnom \nPenh to serve as a one-stop multimedia information resource on the GMS for the public. The \nnumber of visitors to the LRC has continued to increase, and based on the positive experience \nto date, at least one additional LRC will be established in Vientiane, Lao PDR in Phase III. PPP \nPhase III will also continue to bring out its newsletter (Mekong Leaders) and maintain an \nupdated website, both of which serve as a forum for (i) disseminating information about PPP\u2018s \nactivities and achievements, and (ii) alumni to share experiences and best practices.  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million equivalent and will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. As in previous \nphases, additional sources of funding will be actively explored. Supplemental financing will be \nused to expand the range of activities planned under PPP Phase III.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. A steering committee chaired by the \nDirector General of ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department (SERD) and composed of GMS national \ncoordinators and representatives of participating donors will provide guidance for PPP activities \nand policy directions. Responsibility for day-to-day management of the program will vest with \nthe PPP secretariat, located in SERD at ADB headquarters. A PPP focal point in each GMS \ncountry assigned by their respective GMS national secretariats, and point persons in the ADB \nResident Missions, will provide logistical and administrative support to the PPP secretariat for \nthe conduct of PPP activities. Learning programs will be conducted through the network of \ninstitutional partners. An advisory board will provide strategic direction and overall guidance on \nincorporating cutting-edge principles in development management. The board will meet annually \nand will comprise six members, who have distinguished themselves in various fields in the Asia \nand  Pacific  Region,  and  can  contribute  their  knowledge  to  strengthening  capacity  building \nstrategies in the region.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented through individually recruited international and national \nconsultants who will work under the supervision of ADB staff responsible for administration of \nthe TA. It is anticipated that 10 person-months of international and 96 person-months of national \nconsultants will be required for TA implementation. The learning programs will be delivered both \nthrough institutions and through direct hiring of resource persons who will serve as faculty for \nthe learning programs. The consultants and resource persons will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADBs\u2019 Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The indicative Terms of Reference for the consultants are at Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 2 years. It will commence in August 2007 \nand will be completed in August 2009. A final review based on the impact assessment will be \nundertaken  in  July  2009.  Office  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). On completion of the TA all \nequipment procured will be retained by the PPP secretariat and used for follow-up programs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management III, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved efficiency and  By  2012,  compared  \u2022 Government statistical  \u2022 Overall economic climate \neffectiveness of  with 2007 Baseline   and economic reports  remains positive \ndevelopment  1.1 Significant  \u2022 Asian Development Bank   \nmanagement in the  improvement in per  (ADB) annual  Risk \nGreater Mekong  capita gross  development reports   \u2022 External risks undermine \nSubregion (GMS)  domestic product in   \u2022 World Bank development  economic growth \ncountries   GMS countries  reports   \n  1.2 Significant  \u2022 United Nations Statistical   \nimprovement in the  Yearbook \nquality of    \ndevelopment \ndecisions and \nenhanced policy-\nmaking capacity \n1.3 Significant \nimprovement in \nmanagement \nperformance \n \nOutcome   1.1 Improved capacity  \u2022  ADB mission reviews  Assumptions \nEnhanced  capacity of  for planning,  \u2022  Project performance  \u2022 Sustained political \nGMS government  design, and  reports  commitment and support \nofficials and  implementation of  \u2022  Reports and statements  of GMS countries to the \ndevelopment  programs and  in high-level forums  Phnom Penh Plan (PPP) \ninstitutions in the  projects  (GMS summit and  \u2022 Partnership   \nsubregion  1.2 Significant  ministerial meetings)   arrangements ensure \nimprovement in  \u2022  Tracer study reports  technology transfer and \nadministrative  \u2022  Independent  knowledge sharing \nefficiency and  consultant\u2019s reports    \neffectiveness  in  \u2022  Learning program   \nimplementation of  reports (feedback and  Risk \nADB-funded  evaluation reports)  \u2022 Financial and human, \nnational and  resource constraints \nsubregional  hamper institutional \nprojects  strengthening  \n1.3 Significant \nimprovement in the \ninstitutional \ncapacities of GMS-\nbased education \nand training \ninstitutions \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
