THE ENSUING INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \n1.  The proposed investment program will enhance food security and rural economic growth \nin Punjab province.1 It will increase the agricultural production by developing a new seasonal \nirrigation system in Bhakkar, Jhang, Khushab, and Layyah districts of Punjab. The Greater Thal \nCanal (GTC) irrigation scheme will convert about 704,000 hectares (ha) of unproductive lands to \nirrigated lands. The scheme was partially constructed or is planned to be constructed by the \ngovernment\u2019s  fund.  The  proposed  investment  program  will  support  the  construction  of  the \nremaining parts covering about 440,000 ha to complete the development of the scheme and \nprovide support to farmers for on-farm development and management.  \n \n2.  Sector overview. It is estimated that an ever increasing population in Pakistan will require \n40%\u201350% additional food by 2025. However, agricultural productivity in Pakistan is well below \nglobal and even regional standards, due in large part to poor management of water resources.2 \nPunjab is the country\u2019s demographic and economic hub, containing around 100 million people \nand over 50% of national gross domestic product.3 Punjab\u2019s overall contribution towards the \nagriculture  sector  of  the  country  is  estimated  at  more  than  80%,  and  therefore  improved \nagriculture productivity and production in Punjab significantly contributes to enhancing country\u2019s \nfood security.  \n \n3.  Improved agricultural productivity and production can also have a direct positive impact \non the people in Punjab who live in poverty and women working in the sector. Agriculture that \ngenerates about 40% of the provincial labor force remains the dominant source of income and \nlivelihoods in rural Punjab. The incidence of poverty is higher in rural areas where agriculture \nremains the major source of income and livelihoods.  \n \n4.  Pakistan is mostly semi-arid and arid, and thus, over 90% of agriculture output comes \nfrom irrigated agriculture. Out of 22.04 million ha of cultivated land in Pakistan, approximately \n18.80 million ha are irrigated, with the remainder being rain-fed (barani) agricultural areas.4 One \nof the fundamental strengths of Pakistan\u2019s agriculture is the availability of water from the Indus \nBasin Irrigation System (IBIS), drawing from the Indus River and its tributaries. The IBIS covers \nover 14.9 million ha of farm land, consisting of three major multipurpose reservoirs, 23 barrages, \nheadworks, and siphons, 12 inter-river link canals, and 45 major irrigation canal commands.5 Over \n70% of the cropped area of the IBIS is in Punjab. Farming in areas outside of the IBIS relies on \nrainfall or groundwater. Intensive pumping is lowering water tables in some areas by about one \nmeter annually. This increases pumping costs and results in saltwater intrusion into aquifers. As \na result, these areas suffer from frequent crop failures, low agricultural productivity, and land \nsalinization, contributing to low farm incomes and slow agricultural growth. \n \n5.  Proposed interventions. The central part of Punjab is planned to be irrigated through the \nGTC irrigation scheme that will comprise the IBIS. It will draw water from the existing Chashma-\nJhelum link canal which diverts water from the Indus River to eastern areas. Water allocation for \n                                                 \n1  The investment program is included in ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Pakistan, 2017\u20132019.

Rome.  \n ", "2 \nthe entire GTC irrigation scheme has been determined and approved in 1991 under the Pakistan \nWater Apportionment Accord that sets water resources allocation among four provinces. The \ngovernment has completed a feasibility study and detailed engineering design for the entire \nscheme, and constructed the main canal and the first branch called Mankera (65 km) in 2010. \nThe second branch called Choubara (73 km) is planned to be constructed by the provincial \ngovernment from 2018. The construction of the remaining three branch canals has not been \ninitiated, and therefore, out of 704,000 ha of the entire scheme, about 440,000 ha of land under \nthese three branches remains excluded from the IBIS and low productive. \n \n6.  The proposed investment program will construct the three remaining branch canals, i.e. \nDhingana (91 km), Mahmood (54 km) and Nurpur (58 km), and associated structures to provide \na reliable irrigation water supply to 440,000 ha of the land during the monsoon (kharif) season \nfrom around April to October and will provide on-farm command area development support for \nthe entire GTC irrigation scheme to enhance the on-farm and water management capacity of \nfarmers. \n \n7.  The proposed intervention is likely take a phased approach applying a multitranche \nfinancing facility (MFF), although the most suitable financing modality will be examined during the \nproject  preparation.  The  proposed  interventions  have  been  well  defined,  and  will  require \nsignificant investment of about $550 million covering about 440,000 ha of the irrigation area. On-\nfarm command area development support can be started only after having irrigation water in new \nirrigation canals. The MFF is expected to have two tranches. The first tranche will construct two \nnew branch canals (Dhingana and Mahmood) with associated structures and will conduct on-farm \ncommand area development support in the existing branch canal areas (Mankera and Chaubara). \nSubsequently, under the second tranche, the remaining one branch (Nurpur) with associated \nstructures  will  be  constructed  and  on-farm  command  area  development  supports  will  be \nconducted in the rest of the project area starting from the two branch areas that will be constructed \nunder the first tranche.  \n \n8.  The MFF also allows (i) strategic and systematic interventions that can facilitate longer-\nterm development and management planning of water resources including irrigation; and (ii) \nlonger, more effective and strategic support for enhancing provincial-level institutional capacity, \nwith a particular attention on the province\u2019s strategy to transform the Punjab Irrigation Department \n(PID) to a water resources department.   \n \n9.  The PID which will serve as the executing agency of the investment program has a long-\nterm plan to transfer from a traditional irrigation water deliverer to a water resources department \nthat will comprehensively plan, develop and manage water resources for various water uses \nincluding water-related disasters. ADB\u2019s Capacity Development Technical Assistance (CDTA)6 \nsupports the PID for developing an action plan for the transformation and institutional capacity \nenhancement. As irrigation is the dominant water user, the investment program will be designed \nin due consideration of findings and outputs of the CDTA, and may be designed to implement the \naction plan to be proposed by the CDTA.  \n \n10.  The due diligence for sector road map, policy framework, and governance-related issues \nwere  carried  out  in  2006  when  the  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program  was \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2016.

Impacts, outcomes and outputs. The impacts of the proposed investment program will \nbe aligned with: food security increased8 and rural poverty in Punjab reduced.9 The outcome will \nbe agricultural production in the project area increased. The anticipated outputs are: (i) three \nbranches of the GTC Irrigation System constructed that will be accomplished by the construction \nof 203 km of primary canals (i.e. Dhingana, Mahmood, and Nurpur branch canals), 970 km of \nsecondary canals (i.e. distributaries), 246 km of tertiary canals (i.e. minors) and associated \nstructures  to  convey  irrigation  water  to  the  project  area;  (ii)  farmer\u2019s  on-farm  and  water \nmanagement  capacity  improved  that  will  be  accomplished  by  community  mobilization  for \nformulating farmers\u2019 organizations and water users\u2019 associations, construction of water courses \nby the community contract, on-farm agriculture development support and capacity development \ntraining to farmers including crop diversification, high efficiency agriculture and appropriate water \nmanagement; and (iii) institutional system for irrigation scheme management strengthened, \nincluding  an  improved  PID\u2019s  knowledge  base  and  institutional  performance  in  monitoring, \nmanagement and operation and management of irrigation schemes.  \n \n12.  Tentative financing plan. An MFF is tentatively estimated at $440 million of ADB-\nfinancing. The first tranche is envisaged for $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nand the remaining $140 million is envisaged for the second tranche. The total cost of the \ninvestment program and each tranche will be further assessed during the transaction technical \nassistance (TRTA). Financing in combination with concessional ordinary capital resources may \nbe considered, depending on the fund availability.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n13.  The transaction TA will help the government prepare the investment program. A feasibility \nstudy and detailed engineering design has been completed by the government in 2008. The TRTA \nwill verify the detailed design, update the existing cost estimates and feasibility study including \neconomic and financial viability. The TRTA will formulate the project design as an MFF, or more \nappropriate financing modality, if any, that will include on-farm command area development \nsupport and institutional capacity strengthening. The TRTA will also conduct other project related \ndue diligence like environmental and social safeguards, poverty and gender, financial and \nprocurement risk assessments, risk assessment and management plan preparation, and climate \nrisk vulnerability. \n \nB.
