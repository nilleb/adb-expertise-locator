In  May  1998,  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation1  (APEC)  Finance  Ministers \nMeeting (FMM) endorsed establishment of the APEC Financial Regulators Training Initiative \n(FRTI) to enhance training efforts for national and regional financial regulators (i.e., within Asia). \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been acting as the FRTI Secretariat and financially \nsupported  its  training  activities.  Considering  progress  achieved  under  the  FRTI  and  the \ncontinued need for training in this area, the 12th APEC FMM during 8\u20139 September 2005 in \nJeju, Republic of Korea, extended the FRTI for another year and requested a continuation of \nADB support. At the meeting of the 20th APEC Finance Ministers Technical Working Group \n(TWG) Meeting in Gwangju, Republic of Korea, in June 2005, two new APEC initiatives were \nendorsed: (i) Reform of Financial Sector Initiative (by Australia, People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), Indonesia, Japan, and (ii) Fiscal Management Initiative (by Australia, Indonesia, Viet \nNam). The two initiatives were introduced at the meeting of the 21st APEC Finance Ministers \nTWG  Meeting  in  Hanoi,  Viet  Nam,  7\u20139  December  2005,  and  ADB  was  asked  to  provide \ntechnical support along with the World Bank. The World Bank is expected to provide basic \npolicy research as well as lessons learned from experience outside of Asia, while ADB is \nexpected to share experiences garnered from within Asia.  \n \n2.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)2  is  to  provide  ADB  support  for  these  and  other \ncollaborative initiatives coming in the next 2 years under the APEC Finance Ministers Process \n(AFMP). The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In  1994,  the  APEC  finance  ministers  started  an  annual  forum  for  APEC  member \neconomies  to  exchange  views  and  information  on  regional  financial  developments  and  to \npursue cooperative programs that promote financial sector development and liberalization. The \nAFMP forum comprises (i) an annual FMM to discuss specific policy themes; (ii) an annual \nAPEC  deputies  meeting  preceding  the  FMM;  and  (iii)  semiannual  finance  ministers  TWG \nmeetings, which bring relevant experts together for detailed discussions and exchange of ideas \non the specific AFMP themes, as well as review of ongoing and newly proposed policy initiatives.  \n \n4.  Subsequently, the Asian financial crisis exposed a number of structural weakness and \nimperfections  in  the  macroeconomic  frameworks  and  financial  markets  in  the  affected \neconomies. Addressing these issues is critical to the resolution of the current problems and \nprevention  of  similar  shocks  in  the  future.  The  adverse  effects  of  the  crisis  created  new \nchallenges for APEC economies. Thus, new strategic goals for the AFMP were reviewed and \nagreed  at  the  8th  APEC  FMM  in  Suzhou,  PRC,  in  September  2001.  These  goals,  which \ncomplement  the  overall  goals  of  APEC,  are  to  promote  sound  and  credible  policies  for \n(i) sustainable and broad-based growth with equity in the APEC region; (ii) good corporate \ngovernance  and  public  sector  management;  (iii)  stable  and  efficient  financial  markets; \n(iv) greater economic cooperation, integration, and openness among APEC economies; and \n(v) facilitation of economic and technical cooperation within the region in pursuit of these goals.   \n \n5.  Since the first APEC FMM in 1994 in Honolulu, United States (US), the ADB President \nhas been invited annually to attend these meetings, and ADB staff have participated to help \n                                                 \n1  Member economies include Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Canada; Chile; People\u2019s Republic of China; Hong Kong, \nChina;  Indonesia;  Japan;  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  Mexico;  New  Zealand;  Papua  New  Guinea;  Peru; \nPhilippines; Russian Federation; Singapore; Taipei,China; Thailand; United States; and Viet Nam. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 10 May 2006. \n ", "2 \npromote  policy  dialogue.  They  also  provide  knowledge  support  relevant  to  (i)  formulating \nmacroeconomic policy for financial stability, (ii) reforming financial market infrastructure for \nfinancial sector stability and restructuring, and (iii) strengthening supervisory and regulatory \nframeworks for a prudent and effective financial market. Including ADB\u2019s support to the APEC \nFRTI, ADB has assisted these forums through studies, surveys, workshops, and capacity-\nbuilding seminars related to the policy agenda and initiatives by the AFMP. ADB has provided \nfive TAs.3  \n \n6.  APEC FRTI (by the US and ADB). Enhancing training efforts for national and regional \nfinancial regulators (i.e., within Asia) with the FRTI is essential for financial sector stability. \nThese  efforts  are  needed  because  (i)  lack  of  adequate  financial  sector  regulation  and \nsupervision was one of the major causes of the Asian financial crisis, and (ii) policy and \ngovernance issues, and inadequate capacity of banking supervisors and securities regulators \nwere identified as key constraints to implementing the best international practices in financial \nsector regulation and supervision in many of the countries affected by the financial crisis. Many \nAPEC  economies  and  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  have  committed  to \nimplementing the core principles for banking supervision and securities regulation developed by \nthe  Bank  for  International  Settlements  and  the  International  Organization  of  Securities \nCommissions (IOSCO). \n  \n7.  The FRTI has had separate programs for banking supervisors and securities regulators.4 \nThe banking supervision program5 receives major TA support from the US Federal Reserve \nSystem and has taken the initiative in providing trainers and seminar materials.6 The securities \nregulation7 program has been under more diversified commitments and used instructors from \nregulatory and other relevant institutions in APEC member economies such as Hong Kong \nMonetary Authority; Monetary Authority of Singapore; and Securities Commission, Malaysia, for \nits training courses.8 The FRTI also developed audiovisual training products covering the core \nareas of banking supervision training (i.e., bank analysis, credit risk analysis, and market risk \nanalysis), as well as a web-based self-study course for newly hired securities regulators. The \nwork of the FRTI receives oversight through the APEC Advisory Group, representing bank \nsupervision and securities regulatory agencies from member countries and other interested \nparties (Advisory Group members for banking are from 14 member countries and for security, \n13 member countries). The present chair country for the Advisory Group is Malaysia since 2004 \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1996.

In addition, seminars \nare held on current regulatory issues such as demutualization and investor education. \n8  As no other international organizations (even International Organization of Securities Commissions) provides \ntraining for intersecurity regulators, FRTI security regulator training is considered significant. ", "     3 \nuntil the 2006 APEC Advisory Group meeting). Evaluation sheets are collected at each seminar \nand results are reported to Advisory Group members. At the same time, a follow-up evaluation \nquery to Advisory Group members is completed 6 months after each seminar. \n \n8.  Initiative on Financial Reform in the APEC Region (by Australia, PRC, Indonesia, \nJapan, and Viet Nam). The aim of the initiative is to discuss how APEC member economies \nhave developed and implemented reforms to improve their financial sector. Key issues include \n(i) how  economies  are  coping  with  the  challenge  of  carrying  out  financial  reform,  (ii)  how \npriorities are determined for the implementation of remaining reforms, and (iii) assessment of \nwhether gaps exist in expertise and capacity-building efforts. A policy dialogue will be held in \nmid  2006  to  exchange  views  on  the  progress  of  financial  sector  reforms  in  the  member \neconomies. The dialogue will cover the broad range of regulatory measures relevant to financial \nstability,  including  capital  standards  and  credit  assessment,  standards  and  practices  in \nprudential supervision, and underlying legal frameworks (including insolvency regimes).  \n \n9.  Fiscal Management Initiative (by Australia, Indonesia, and Viet Nam,). The aim of \nthe initiative is to build on a broad-ranging fiscal policy report to finance ministers in 2004 by \nundertaking a dialogue on a practical issue\u2014the management of significant off-balance sheet \nrisks,  such  as  contingent  liabilities  associated  with  financing  infrastructure  projects  or  with \nexplicit guarantees to public or private institutions. The extent to which these risks are reflected \nin government reports and the potential impact on an economy's overall fiscal position are \nissues that are important to the sustainability and transparency of fiscal policy. The initiative will \ndiscuss  the  measurement,  monitoring,  and  management  of  these  fiscal  risks;  and  the \nconsequences of contingent liabilities for the operation of fiscal rules. The first policy dialogue, \n27\u201328  February  2006,  discussed  international  experience  and  best  practices,  and  shared \nexperiences in the Asia and Pacific region.9  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will support AFMP initiatives that seek cooperative regional solutions to fiscal \nmanagement and financial sector issues, and will provide policy advice in the area of regional \neconomic cooperation and integration. The TA will help strengthen the capacity of financial \nsector regulators and supervisors in the region through support for regional training efforts and \nseminars. The TA will also support the emerging policy dialogue and technical discussions on \nfinancial sector reforms and development, fiscal management, and monetary and economic \nstabilization.  ADB\u2019s  active  participation  in  that  process  helps  to  strengthen  the  Asian \ncontribution to the dialogue as well as permit ADB staff to learn new approaches to address \nspecific policy issues through discussions within a community of experts. These new ideas can \npotentially be useful for ADB\u2019s own policy dialogue and reform programs with the DMCs. Thus, \nto the extent possible, the governance, finance, and trade divisions of the regional departments \nwill be encouraged to participate in the workshops, either directly or indirectly, through inputs \nand feedback on ADB\u2019s contributions to those initiatives. This TA is in line with key result areas \nof the Office of Regional Economic Integration for supporting capacity building and institutional \nstrengthening,  promoting  regional  economic  policy  dialogue,  and  conducting  research  on \nregional cooperation and integration. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB Mission to the APEC Policy Dialogue Workshop on Fiscal Management headed by Cindy Houser made a \npresentation on Measuring SOE and GBE Worth: The Balance Sheet Approach. \n ", "4 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support the activities initiated by the AFMP. Specific components of the \nactivities identified so far are the following:  \n \n(i)  APEC  Financial  Regulators  Training  Initiative.  The FRTI has made good \nprogress in achieving its two original objectives: (a) strengthening content and \nmanagement of national training programs, and (b) developing regional programs \nfor junior and mid-Ievel supervisors and regulators. The FRTI has trained almost \n1,491 participants from APEC and 165 participants from non-APEC economies \nthrough 28 regional and 13 national courses from 2001 to 2005. The TA will \ncontinue  to  support  the  APEC  FRTI  for  another  2  years 10   through  the \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  additional  training  courses  for  financial \nregulators and supervisors in DMCs and developed Asian APEC economies, in \nline with training priorities identified by advisory group members. The TA will help \ncomplete training curricula and materials, and continue to build a critical mass of \npotential trainers in the region. All courses will be open to participants from Asian \nAPEC economies and non-APEC DMCs. Training materials and seminar papers \nare provided through the APEC FRTI website at www.adb.org and/or distributed \ndirectly to DMC financial supervisory authorities and regional training institutions \nsuch as the South East Asian Central Banks Research and Training Centre, \nwhose staff will be invited to join the training courses organized under the TA. \nThe TA will also support updating course material, strengthening information \ndissemination  of  the  APEC  FRTI  through  the  website,  and  enhancing \nmanagement of the FRTI advisory group structure through a network of banking \nsupervisors and security regulators among Asian APEC economies and non-\nAPEC DMCs. \n \nThe expected results and outputs are (a) at least 250 participants from regulatory \nand  supervisory  agencies  trained in  priority  training  topics  over  2  years,  (b) \nnetworking among APEC financial regulators on training issues strengthened, \nand (c) course curricula and materials developed and used by national and \nregional training institutions. \n \n(ii)  Initiative on Financial Reform in the APEC Region. Together with the World \nBank, ADB has been asked to provide technical support on financial reform. An \nimmediate requirement is a paper on financial sector reforms and restructuring in \nselected East Asian countries to be presented at a workshop under the financial \nsector initiatives in November 2006, followed by additional papers for workshops \nin 2007. The workshops are open to all APEC members as well as invited guests. \nThe expected results and outputs are papers on financial sector reforms and \nrestructuring  in  selected  East  Asian  countries  (possibly  covering  the  PRC, \nIndonesia, Viet Nam, and Malaysia)11 to be presented in a series of workshops \nduring 2006\u20132007. \n \n                                                 \n10  Extending the APEC FRTI is endorsed annually by the APEC FMM. However, this TA proposes ADB support for \nanother 2 years with the provision of strong recommendation by the US and APEC Advisory Group member \ncountries.  \n11  The PRC, Indonesia, and Viet Nam are chosen as they are initiating the Financial Reform Initiative. Malaysia is \nchosen as an example of successful financial reform.  ", "     5 \n(iii)  Fiscal Management Initiative. Together with the World Bank, ADB has been \nasked  to  provide  technical  support  on  fiscal  management.  An  immediate \nrequirement is a paper on measurement issues relating to assessing the fiscal \nrisks arising from state-owned enterprises in selected APEC member economies \nto be presented in a workshop in November 2006.  Similar requirements are \nexpected in 2007. The workshops are open to all APEC members as well as \ninvited guests. For the first Policy Dialogue on Fiscal Management held in Hanoi, \nViet Nam; Cambodia and Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic attended as guests. \nThe expected results and outputs are papers on assessing fiscal risks in APEC \nmember economies to be presented in a series of workshops during 2006\u20132007. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost will cover remuneration and travel expenses of \ninternational and national consultants, travel expenses of seminar resource persons, upgrading \nof training programs, and other miscellaneous expenses. The TA cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the TA Executing Agency and the Office of Regional Economic Integration \nwill implement the TA, in close collaboration with the Advisory Group of the APEC FRTI.  \n \n14.  The TA activities will be implemented with the assistance of international and national \nconsultants. The TA will support the APEC FRTI activities by (i) conducting regional training \nseminars for financial regulators and supervisors on priority topics, (ii) organizing advisory group \nmeetings for selecting topics and curricula, (iii) disseminating information on the seminars and \nfacilitating the network of financial regulators and supervisors through the project website, and \n(iv) upgrading the training program. The TA will also finance the engagement of consultants for \n(i) preparing papers for the Initiative on Financial Reform in the APEC Region and the Fiscal \nManagement Initiative; and (ii) attending the initiatives\u2019 seminars and conferences, and making \npresentations. The TA will require approximately 16 person-months of international and 23 \nperson-months of national consulting services. The TA will be implemented over 2 years starting \nfrom July 2006. All consultants and all resource persons will be engaged in accordance with \nADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individual \nconsultants.  The  scope  of  work  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.
