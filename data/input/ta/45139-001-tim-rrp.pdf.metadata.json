I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant to \nthe Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Mid-Level Skills Training Project.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  project  will  assist  the  Government  of  Timor-Leste  in  introducing  and \nimplementing mid-level skills training in construction and automotive trades by strengthening \nselected public and private training providers. The project will build on existing training programs \nand facilities which have a proven record of delivering quality skills training at basic levels. By \nfilling skills gaps in the current system of technical and vocational education and training (TVET), \nthe  project  will  help  the  government  develop  a  skilled  workforce  and  improve  employment \nopportunities for men and women in Timor-Leste. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The economy of Timor-Leste has been growing strongly, averaging annual growth of more \nthan 10% since 2007. Timor-Leste\u2019s Strategic Development Plan (SDP) 2011\u20132030 aims to \nsustain double-digit economic growth, with a vision of building a modern, diversified economy by \n2030 focusing on high-quality infrastructure and the petroleum sector as a significant industrial \nbase.2 The SDP points to the shortage of skilled human resources as a critical challenge in \nachieving this vision and, in response, emphasizes human capital investment, particularly job \nskills development, as a key strategy in coming years. \n \n4.  The country\u2019s population has been growing rapidly, averaging 2.4% growth in 2004\u20132010, \nand 52% of the nation\u2019s population of 1.1 million is under the age of 20.3 Providing a large young \npopulation with knowledge and skills relevant for the rapidly developing economy and absorbing \nthem into the labor force pose key challenges. The youth unemployment rate (among 15\u201329 year \nolds) is 19% nationally and 27% in urban areas. Underemployment is also extensive, with many \nyoung  people  absorbed  in  the  agriculture  sector  at  low  rates  of  productivity.  Despite  the \nabundance of unemployed and underemployed youth, the fast-growing economy is faced with a \nshortage of practically skilled Timorese workers and relies instead on considerable numbers of \nforeign  workers.  \n \n5.  The government\u2019s plan to accelerate infrastructure development in areas such as roads, \nbuilding  construction,  water  supply,  and  energy  is  driving  demand  for  skilled  workers  in \nconstruction trades. With the rapid expansion of construction activities, the use of construction \nequipment, automobiles, and other transport services is rising rapidly, as is the demand for skilled \nmechanics. Yet few Timorese workers have technical skills that can support rapid infrastructure \nexpansion. According to the 2010 labor force survey, about 13,000 persons aged 15 and older \nreported  working  in  construction  industries.4 Only  3,000  of  these  workers  had  completed \nsecondary, technical, or vocational education, and most of them were likely to work as semiskilled \nor unskilled workers. While there are no precise data on foreign skilled workers, a 2008 survey of \nenterprises  and  recent  field  studies  indicate  that  foreign  workers fill  key  skilled  positions  in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011.

Timor-\nLeste Labor Force Survey 2010. Dili. ", "2 \nconstruction  and  auto-mechanical  fields.5 Jobs  typically  filled  by  foreign  workers  included \nengineers and skilled positions such as plumbers, electricians, masons, welders, and mechanics. \n \n6.  The TVET subsector in Timor-Leste consists of technical high schools under the Ministry \nof Education (MOE), and post-school vocational training providers overseen by the Secretariat of \nState for Vocational Training and Employment (SEFOPE).6 The majority of vocational training \nproviders are supported by nongovernment organizations, church institutions, or international \ndonors. Skills training programs range from basic life skills to specific occupational skills. Many \nvocational training programs, however, fall short in preparing trainees with skills required in the \nlabor market due to (i) their focus on remedial courses to raise basic literacy and numeracy \namong  trainees,  (ii)  the  programs\u2019  weak  links  to  the  labor  market,  (iii)  a  lack  of  standard \nqualifications for training institutions, and (iv) a lack of qualified teachers. Many training courses \ntend to be supply driven or in low-cost areas such as business administration and tourism, with \npoor links to the needs of the local labor market. \n \n7.  Quality  assurance  and  more  demand-driven  training  standards  have  recently  been \nadopted in the TVET subsector with support from development partners. To develop competency \nstandards based on industry inputs and to accredit vocational training providers, the National \nLabor  Force  Development  Institute  (INDMO)  was  established  in  2008  as  an  autonomous \nregulatory  agency  under  the  auspices  of  SEFOPE.  Industry  subcommissions  have  been \norganized to advise INDMO on competency standards and qualifications within their particular \nindustry. For regulation and accreditation of post-secondary educational institutions, the National \nAgency for Academic Assessment and Accreditation (ANAAA) was established under the MOE. \nThe work by the ANAAA and INDMO formed the basis of the national qualification framework \n(NQF), which was approved in April 2011. INDMO is responsible for regulating qualification levels \n1\u20134 of vocational training and foundation courses, while the ANAAA is responsible for qualification \nlevels 5\u201310 in higher education.7 \n \n8.  The most recent review of TVET outcomes by SEFOPE indicates that approximately \n1,900  trainees  completed  vocational  training  courses  in  2009  across  four  technical  areas\u2014\nadministration and finance, tourism and hospitality, construction and mechanics, and agriculture.8 \nFemales made up about 40% of these trainees, mostly concentrated in administration, finance, \ntourism, and hospitality. About 32% of trainees were trained in construction and mechanical \ntrades. The review identified 15\u201318 providers as delivering quality training across a range of \nindustry areas, but mostly at basic qualification levels. While there is an increasing demand for \nmid-level technical workers (levels 2\u20134), particularly in construction and automotive trades, no \nvocational training provider is yet to provide mid-level skills training and only a few training \nproviders have the capacity to deliver training at higher than basic levels. \n \n9.  The project aims to help fill the gap in mid-level skills training (levels 2\u20134) in construction \nand automotive trades by targeting and upgrading the strongest training providers to deliver \n                                                \n5  Richard Curtain. 2009. Skills in Demand: Identifying the Skill Needs of Enterprises in Construction and Hospitality in \nTimor-Leste. Final draft for comment. Field studies on automotive repair shops and construction companies in Dili were \ncarried out during project preparation. \n6  Official acronyms for government agencies are Portuguese acronyms. \n7  For qualification levels 1\u20134 under the NQF, a formal certificate is awarded when a person demonstrates the skills and \nknowledge specified in the industry competency standards, usually acquired through vocational training providers or on \nthe job training. Level 1 skills generally correspond to workers being able to undertake well-defined tasks in their skill \narea; at level 2 workers are able to perform a broader range of tasks in their skill area; level 3 workers are highly skilled \ntechnicians in their fields; and level 4 workers are supervisors. Qualification levels 5\u201310 represent diplomas and degrees \nfrom higher educational institutions, ranging from polytechnic diplomas to university doctorate degrees. \n8  SEFOPE. 2011. Review of 2009 TVET Training Outcomes. Dili. \n ", "3 \ntraining at higher than basic levels. Given past and ongoing assistance to basic education and \nbasic skills training by other development partners, the project will focus its support on specific \nmid-level vocational skills training through SEFOPE. To implement mid-level skills training, the \nproject will support the development of competency-based training standards and improve the \nquality of teaching staff. It will also facilitate the role of the private sector and strengthen the labor \nmarket information system (LMIS) to build demand-driven skills training that is relevant and \nresponsive to the needs of the expanding Timorese economy. \n \n10.  The project is aligned with Timor-Leste\u2019s SDP and its focus on accelerated infrastructure \nand capacity development. The project is the first major step in the engagement by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in TVET in Timor-Leste, in accordance with the country partnership \nstrategy (CPS) 2011\u20132015 and country operations business plan 2011\u20132013.9 As indicated in the \nCPS,  ADB\u2019s  extensive  experience  in  TVET  will  assist  the  government  in  addressing  skills \nshortages in infrastructure and other areas of the economy. \n \n11.  The project is also harmonized with assistance provided by other development partners. \nThe Australian Agency for International Development and the International Labor Organization are \nmajor  partners  in  the  TVET  subsector.  Their  support  to  the  Youth  Employment  Promotion \nProgram  since  2008  led  to  the  establishment  of INDMO  and  the  NQF.  Other  development \npartners in TVET include the European Commission, the Government of Brazil, and the Spanish \nInternational Cooperation. The project builds on previous and ongoing support in TVET and will be \nimplemented in close cooperation with these development partners. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The project will contribute to the development of a skilled workforce in Timor-Leste with \nimproved  quality  and  higher  levels  of  vocational  training.  The  project\u2019s  outcome  will  be  an \nenhanced TVET system with mid-level skills training (levels 2\u20134) that is relevant and responsive to \nlabor market needs. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The project will deliver five outputs: (i) mid-level skills training provision, (ii) technical \nteacher  training,  (iii)  enhanced  labor  market  linkages  of  TVET,  (iv)  strengthened  SEFOPE \nfinancing and support for TVET, and (v) project implementation and management. \n \n1.  Mid-Level Skills Training Provision \n \n14.  This output will support the provision of training at certificate levels 2\u20134 in construction and \nautomotive skills by (i) developing national skills standards and curricula, (ii) improving technical \nskills of teachers, and (iii) upgrading facilities and equipment of selected training providers to deliver \ncompetency-based training. \n \n15.  Development of industry-based training standards and curriculum. INDMO has been \ndeveloping competency-based skills standards for levels 1\u20132 in construction and automotive skills \nbased on industry inputs and the established procedures of the NQF. The project will support \nINDMO to further develop level 3\u20134 skills standards, including modular programs. Curricula and \nlearning materials will be produced by adapting internationally available materials according to \nTimor-Leste requirements. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Upgrading facilities and equipment of public training provider. The Tibar Training \nCenter (Tibar) is one of two public training providers and is recognized by INDMO as delivering \nquality  basic  skills  training  in  construction  trades  (mainly  carpentry,  plumbing,  electrical, \nmasonry, and solar energy).10 The project will finance the upgrading of facilities and equipment \nat Tibar to deliver competency-based training at levels 2\u20134, and the construction of dormitory \nfacilities to expand access by students from remote areas and by women. The dormitory facility \nwill also be used to accommodate teachers participating in technical teacher training programs \n(see output 2). \n \n17.  Upgrading facilities and equipment of private training providers. The project will \nsupport two registered private (nongovernment) training providers\u2014Dili Institute of Technology (DIT) \nBaucau and Don Bosco at Comoro\u2014with facility and equipment upgrades to deliver mid-level skills \ntraining in the project\u2019s priority skill areas.11 They will be required to enter into a partnership \nagreement with SEFOPE to take part in the project.12 The agreement will specify the scope of \nassistance for each training provider and outline the rights and obligations of SEFOPE and the \ntraining providers. Obligations of training providers  will include commitments to train specified \nnumbers of trainees in mid-level skills programs, and to operate and maintain upgraded facilities \nand equipment. The agreements will ensure that support provided to the private training providers is \npassed to trainees through the provision of quality training at a reduced cost. A long-term plan \nensuring the continued delivery of mid-level skills training by these providers will also be developed \nduring project implementation.13  \n \n2.  Technical Teacher Training \n \n18.  This  output  will  improve  the  technical  and  pedagogical  capacity  of  teachers  from \nparticipating training providers to ensure the delivery of level 2\u20134 training in construction and \nautomotive trades. The project will help SEFOPE establish a new vocational training development \ncenter (VTDC), deliver in-service training for TVET teaching staff, and develop long-term plans to \nimprove the skills of TVET teaching staff.  \n \n19.  Establishing a vocational training development center. A new VTDC will be established \nat an existing facility at Tibar with appropriate equipment and staff to provide in-service training \nprograms for TVET technical teaching staff. The project will also support the development of a long-\nterm plan for TVET teacher training programs, and an institutional plan for the VTDC outlining its \nfinancing mechanism and sustainability.  \n \n20.  Training  of  trainers.  Intensive  in-service  training  at  the  VTDC  will  be  provided  by \ninternational trainers to TVET teaching staff to upgrade training skills in construction and automotive \ntrades according to approved certification standards. Technical training will be combined with the \nexisting pedagogical training and training in relevant industry settings, which will be offered as \n                                                \n10 Another  public  institution\u2014the  Senai  Training  Center\u2014was  established  with  support  from  the  Government  of \nBrazil, which continues to fund operational expenses except for salaries for trainers. Since the Senai Center intends to \ncontinue training based on Brazilian certificate standards, it declined to be included in the project. \n11 The criteria for selecting private training providers for project support are described in the Selection Criteria and Profiles of \nProject Training Centers (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). There are currently only four private \nvocational training providers that deliver basic-level training in construction and automotive skills outside the formal \neducational system. Of these four training providers, two did not satisfy selection criteria, and hence only the two \nremaining private training providers are included for project support. \n12 The guidelines on the preparation of the proposed partnership agreement are in the Project Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 The long-term plan to be developed will consider public\u2013private partnership frameworks, if appropriate. \n ", "5 \nmodular programs. Teachers from the project\u2019s three training providers will form a cadre of master \ntrainers capable of passing on their skills to other technical teachers.  \n \n3.  Enhancing Labor Market Linkages of Technical and Vocational Education \nand Training \n \n21.  Poor perceptions of TVET and lack of information about related career opportunities deter \nmany young people from developing skills relevant to labor market needs. This output will support \nSEFOPE to (i) expand its TVET promotion activities and job counseling services, (ii) facilitate private \nsector employers to provide workplace training or internships, and (iii) improve the LMIS. \n \n22.  TVET  promotion  and  career  guidance.  To  promote  TVET  and  related  career \nopportunities,  the  project  will  undertake  social  marketing  and  outreach  activities  through \ninformation  materials,  media  campaigns,  and  national  skills  fairs.  The  career  counseling \nservices of SEFOPE will be strengthened to assist TVET trainees with job applications and job \nplacements. These activities will be coordinated with employers and industry representatives, \nwith special attention to encouraging female participation in nontraditional skills areas. \n \n23.  Workplace  training. The  project  will  assist  mid-level  skills  training  providers  in \ndeveloping  workplace  training  programs  with  relevant  enterprises.  Contracting  programs  for \nworkplace training will be developed with a fixed payment per student to employers to defray the \ncosts of on-the-job training. The programs will pay special attention to the placement of female \ntrainees. The project will also organize workshops to inform and educate private sector employers \non the role of skills training in improving worker productivity and enterprise profitability. \n \n24.  Improved LMIS. The existing LMIS is confined to gathering supply-side information from \njob-seekers through district employment centers and from trainees in registered TVET providers. \nThe project will introduce demand-side data through employer surveys and enterprise training \nneeds assessments. Combined with supply-side data, the information will yield indicators of skills \nshortages and training needs, which will help SEFOPE decide on funding allocations and assist \nTVET institutions in designing demand-driven training programs. \n \n4.  Strengthening SEFOPE Financing and Support for Technical and \nVocational Education and Training  \n \n25.  The project will help SEFOPE strengthen the delivery of mid-level skills training and improve \nits capacity in TVET management. It will support SEFOPE to (i) develop financing plans to sustain \nmid-level skills delivery in public and private training institutions; (ii) design strategies to expand \naccess  to  TVET  by  young  men  and  women,  especially  those  from  poor  and  disadvantaged \nbackgrounds; and (iii) expand the implementation of mid-level skills training. \n \n26.  The government is currently preparing a TVET strategic plan which, once approved, will \nassist SEFOPE in expanding mid-level skills training. The project will support the expansion, which \nwill involve (i) up-scaling mid-level skills training with additional training providers or programs; (ii) \nimplementing  scholarship  programs  for  mid-level  skills  trainees,  with  a  targeted  allocation  for \nfemales; and (iii) extending workplace training and placements with employers.  \n \n5.  Project Implementation and Management \n \n27.  The  project  will  provide  necessary  support  for  the  project  management  unit  (PMU) \nestablished in SEFOPE to (i) establish the facilities and systems required for effective project \n ", "6 \nimplementation and management; (ii) develop and implement a project monitoring and evaluation \nsystem for main project outputs and the gender action plan; and (iii) effectively and efficiently \nmanage  project  activities,  including  procurement,  accounting,  and  regular  reporting  of  project \nprogress.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n28.  The project is estimated to cost $13 million, including taxes and duties of $159,000, and \nphysical and price contingencies.

A project steering committee will be \nestablished, consisting of the secretary of SEFOPE (chair), MOE, members of INDMO executive \ncommission, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Key development partners in the TVET \nsubsector will participate as observers. The project steering committee will provide overall guidance \nto  the  project  and  ensure  the  integration  of  project  activities  into  overall  TVET  development. \nSEFOPE will establish a PMU which will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation, \ncapacity development, planning and budgeting, procurement, disbursement, monitoring, supervising \nimplementation at training provider level, and reporting to the government and ADB. The PMU will \nbe supported by consultants. \n \n31.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n33.  The economic benefits of the project result mainly from the improved skills of trained \nworkers and the higher wages they can earn as skilled compared with unskilled workers. While it is \nreasonable to expect that system-wide improvements in quality and reliability of competency-based \ntraining will benefit all students in the TVET system, only the wage earnings of graduates from \nproject-supported programs are quantified as incremental benefits. Project benefits also include the \nestimated value of increased activity in the local economy that is expected from higher worker \nearnings and the greater portion of earnings expended in the local economy. Increased numbers of \nTimorese  workers  (rather  than  foreign  workers)  in  high-paying  jobs  spend  more  in  the  local \neconomy (rather than remitting it to home countries) and spur growth in the local economy. The \neconomic analysis  indicates that the project\u2019s  economic  internal rate of return (EIRR)  will be \n26.6%.16 This high EIRR reflects the acute shortage in Timor-Leste of skilled  workers in key \nindustries (i.e., construction and transport), which is driven by the country\u2019s rapid growth and rising \ndemand for skilled workers. \n \n34.  The financial analysis assessed the sustainability of the project at national and project levels, \nand evaluated the impact of the proposed investment given current and projected TVET subsector \nfunding levels. The analysis concluded that the government has the capacity to absorb and sustain \nthe benefits of the project, but that institutional strengthening of SEFOPE is required. Sustainability \nis supported by the existence of the national SDP emphasizing vocational skills development and \nthe ongoing development of a TVET strategic plan. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n35.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessments have been carried out at the \ncountry and executing agency levels. While the government has made progress in developing \ncountry-level financial management systems, further improvements are required, particularly in   \nbudget preparation, execution, accounting, and audit. Procurement regulations have been revised \nseveral times in recent years, and further improvements are being made. This is the first ADB-\nfinanced project with SEFOPE. The financial management and procurement capacity of SEFOPE \nwas assessed as low. To address this, a PMU will be established within SEFOPE and staffed with \nadequate expertise and consultants to ensure compliance with ADB policies and procedures, and to \nstrengthen the financial management and procurement capacity of SEFOPE. All procurement will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and SEFOPE. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 15). \n                                                \n16 Details on the calculations of the EIRR estimate are presented in the Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). The EIRR is estimated by comparing the expected wages of an unskilled worker over a 10-\nyear period to the wages of workers with certified skills supported by the project. A survey of wages at automobile repair \nshops and construction firms around Dili conducted during project preparation augmented information on wages from \nTimor-Leste Labor Force Survey 2010 (footnote 4) and provided the basis for wages of workers at different skill levels. \n ", "9 \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n37.  Despite rapid economic growth and steady progress in human development indicators, the \npoverty level remains high at an estimated 41% in 2009.17 The prevalence of poverty is closely \nassociated with low human resource levels in areas such as literacy, education, and productive \nskills. The formal school system does not equip students with adequate knowledge or practical \nskills, leaving many young people unemployed while many skilled positions in the rapidly expanding \ninfrastructure construction are filled by foreign workers. The unemployment rate in urban areas \nreached 34% in 2010 for those aged 15\u201324 (footnote 3). The project will contribute to skills \ndevelopment for young people by introducing mid-level skills training in construction and automotive \ntrades\u2014areas  that  are  in  great  demand  in  the  labor  market\u2014and  enhance  employment  and \nincome-earning opportunities.  \n \n38.  Gender. The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. To increase women\u2019s \nenrollment in nontraditional skills training and their employment in infrastructure, a gender action \nplan (GAP) has been prepared. The GAP focuses on increasing female enrollment by (i) raising \nawareness of nontraditional TVET and related career options through promotional activities, (ii) \nmaking the curriculum more gender sensitive, (iii) providing gender training to TVET management \nand teaching staff, (iv) constructing a dormitory for female trainees at Tibar, (v) targeting female \nenrollment of at least 20% in construction and automotive trades by 2016, and (vi) recruiting female \ntrainers in skills areas covered by the project. The GAP aims to place at least 80% of female \ntrainees in workplace training programs and strengthen career counseling services by involving \nbusiness women from nontraditional sectors. The project will also develop scholarship programs \ntargeted at females as part of TVET policy implementation plans. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n39.  Environment.  The  project  is  categorized  environment  category  B  and  an  initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). The initial environmental examination found that environmental impacts are minor and can \nbe mitigated. During construction of training and dormitory facilities, excavated materials and solid \nwaste will be managed in a manner that does not create any permanent environmental impact. \nDuring operation, the automotive workshop will ensure proper disposal of hazardous waste such as \nengine oil.  \n \n40.  Social safeguards. The project is classified category C for both involuntary resettlement \nand  indigenous  peoples  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement.  All  civil  works  on \nconstructing or upgrading training and dormitory facilities will be undertaken on existing land owned \nby respective institutions within their current boundaries. The project is not expected to involve any \nissues of involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. If any unanticipated issues are identified \nduring implementation, the government will inform ADB and address these issues according to \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n41.  Major risks and proposed mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4, and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.18   \n                                                \n17 World Bank. 2010.

ASSURANCES \n42.  The government and SEFOPE have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe PAM and grant documents. The government and SEFOPE have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement. Prior to grant effectiveness, the \ngovernment and SEFOPE will have appointed the project director and established the PMU. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.
