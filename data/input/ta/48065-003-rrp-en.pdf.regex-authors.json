THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the Public Sector Enterprises \nReform Program.1 \n \n2.  The  proposed  subprogram  2  of  the  Public  Sector  Enterprises  Reform  Program \n(programmatic approach) will help the Government of Pakistan achieve and sustain reform \ninitiatives aimed at enhancing the performance of public sector enterprises (PSEs) by improving \ntheir  corporate  governance  and  accountability,  and  reducing  their  contingent  liabilities. \nSubprogram 2 will facilitate the creation of fiscal space for critical development expenditures.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Finances of PSEs remain weak despite recent reform initiatives. The 183 PSEs \nowned by the government comprise 169 public sector companies (PSCs), 7 development finance \ninstitutions, and 7 federal authorities. These federal PSEs employ more than 402,543 workers, \nwith total assets of PRs10,823 billion ($103 billion) in FY2015. In FY2015, 172 PSEs (94%) \ndisclosed their financial statements, with 53 PSEs (29%) reporting losses despite significant \nbudget transfers. Total reported aggregate profit was PRs72.98 billion ($0.7 billion), with total \nreported loss of PRs20.35 billion ($0.2 billion). The government\u2019s fiscal risk exposure (combining \nloans and guarantees) was PRs1,472 billion ($14.05 billion) in FY2015.3 Despite recent reform \ninitiatives, PSEs continue to rely on significant regular fiscal transfers and sovereign credit \nguarantees to maintain their operations. The power distribution companies (DISCOs) are the \nmajor recipient of such transfers. Other important beneficiaries include Pakistan International \nAirlines, Pakistan Steel Mill, and Pakistan Railways. In FY2016, the budget allocation to support \nPSEs\u2019 daily operations, including subsidies and other transfers, constituted 59% of overall budget \nallocations to the PSEs. This severely limits the critical capital development expenditures needed \nto improve the efficiency of PSEs. \n \n4.  Fiscal transfers to PSEs jeopardize fiscal sustainability and impede government\u2019s \ndevelopment expenditure. High levels of fiscal transfers to PSEs undermine overall fiscal \nstability  and  growth,  which  adversely  affects  critical  investment  on  social  and  economic \ninfrastructure, especially when the government has very limited ability to fund such investment \nthrough borrowings. The government recognizes the importance of reducing the fiscal deficit and \ngovernment borrowings, and imposed severe cuts in budget transfers to PSEs starting in FY2014; \ntransfers declined from 3.2% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY2012 to 1.5% in FY2016,4 \nand 0.5% in the first 8 months of FY2017 (Figure 1).5 This budget constraint can help boost the \naccountability  and  efficiency  of  PSEs.  Acknowledging  the  fact  that  reduction  in  budgetary \ntransfers is partially attributable to improved performance of some PSEs (including Pakistan \nRailways), hard budget constraint could adversely affect the government\u2019s ability to invest in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Public Sector Enterprises Program ($500,000). The \ntechnical assistance will remain active until 31 December 2018 to support the design, monitoring, and capacity \ndevelopment.  \n3  All these figures are now available in the public domain due to the initiatives taken under the programmatic approach. \nThe report can be accessed from http://www.finance.gov.pk/publications/State_Owned_Entities_FY_2014_15.pdf.  \n4  From PRs634 billion ($6.05 billion) in FY2012 to PRs432 billion ($4.12 billion) in FY2016. \n5 Develop expenditure in Figure 1 implies the government\u2019s support for capacity augmentation. \n ", "2 \npriority  capital  projects  for  some  important  PSEs.  For  example,  the  absence  of  periodic \nmodernization has limited the capacity of Pakistan Railways, leading to reduced market share \nand labor productivity. Current workforce of 78,000 consumes about 70% of annual budgetary \nresources ($375 million in FY2015) for salaries and pension payments alone, severely limiting the \nresources available for urgently needed investments in railway corridors, and upgrading of the \nfreight and passenger services.6 \n \nFigure 1: Federal Transfers to Public Sector Enterprises \nTotal\nSubsidy\nP Development Expenditure\nD\nG\nf \no\n% \nFY2012 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016 FY2017\nFY = fiscal year, GDP =gross domestic product \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Government of Pakistan  \n \n5.  Government\u2019s PSE reform initiatives, sustainability, and constituency building for \nreforms. In mid-FY2013 the government embarked on a PSE reform program to restore PSE \nfinancial viability and reduce fiscal transfers,7 but soon recognized that a successful PSE reform \nprogram requires that two prerequisites be met. First, vested stakeholder interests, particularly \nthose of PSE employees, require improvements in the operating environment and governance of \nPSEs prior to privatization. Adequate stakeholder consultations and a gradual approach are \nnecessary to secure the support of stakeholders for such reforms, which is also true for structural \nreforms that address human resource issues and the affordability of user charges of many PSEs, \nincluding DISCOs and Pakistan Railways. Second, many reforms require that reform initiatives \nbe maintained over a long period to produce the desired results.8 \n \n6.  Priority  challenges  and  ADB  assistance.  To  facilitate  the  government\u2019s  reform \ninitiatives,  ADB  approved  subprogram  1  of  the  programmatic  approach  in  June  2016.9 \nSubprogram 2 continues reforms initiated under subprogram 1. The programmatic approach \naddresses the following three important challenges the government faces while initiating critical \nPSE reforms: \n                                                \n6  Despite significant improvements, the operating ratio of Pakistan Railways (total ordinary working expenses as a \npercentage of gross earnings) remains more than 100%. \n7  On 3 October 2013 the Cabinet Committee on Privatization approved a plan to sequence the capital market and pre-\nprivatization restructuring for 39 PSEs: 11 PSEs for block sales, 25 PSEs for strategic private sector participation, \nand 3 PSEs for restructuring (Pakistan Railways, Pakistan International Airlines, and Pakistan Steel Mills). \n8  Reforms (especially those dealing with politically sensitive issues) are medium- to long-term efforts that require \ncontinuous support to manage the ownership and institutional capacity factors that impact on reform outcomes. \nContinuity in support for reforms is needed to maintain gains and address weaknesses (ADB. 2009. Special \nEvaluation Study: ADB Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhance Results through Ownership, \nCapacity, and Continuity. Manila). \n9  ADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Programmatic \nApproach and Policy-Based Loan for Public Sector Enterprises Reform Program (Subprogram 1) in Pakistan. Manila. \n ", "3 \n(i)  The need to coordinate across various government departments to (a) effectively \nimplement good corporate governance principles; (b) articulate crucial guiding \nprinciples, such as transparency and consistency, on issues related to retirement \nbenefits; (c) facilitate constituency building for critical reforms in PSEs with the help \nof  an  effective  communications  strategy;10 (d)  monitor  and  evaluate  PSEs\u2019 \nperformance; and (e) implement critical structural reforms in some selected PSEs \nto get maximum benefits. \n(ii)  The  need  to  provide  continuing  support  for  some  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram 1, which by their nature, have a long-term implementation cycle. \nContinued assistance for these reforms would consolidate and sustain gains made \nto improve PSE performance. \n(iii)  The need to plan for and address the substantial adjustment costs associated with \nimplementation  of  PSE  reforms.  These  costs  are  a  major  challenge,  given \nPakistan\u2019s current fiscal context. Identification of reforms and selection of PSEs \nwill need to be done very carefully, given the government\u2019s priorities. \n \n7.  Need  for  sequencing of  reforms.  Subprogram  2  is  part  of  an  integrated  solution \ncomprising policy-based loans under a programmatic approach, with clear program costs. This \nwill  help  ADB  and  the  government  design  and  implement  policy  actions  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda without excessively straining the government\u2019s budget to finance \nthe cost of reforms. Several policy actions are politically sensitive and will require time to prepare, \nincluding building a constituency for reforms.11 It is critical that reforms are properly identified and \nlogically sequenced over two subprograms, under the programmatic approach, if they are to be \neffectively implemented. Some policy actions serve to support other actions included in the \nprogrammatic approach (e.g., a public awareness campaign), requiring that the various policy \nactions under the overall programmatic approach be carefully timed.  \n \n8.  Development coordination. The programmatic approach is part of a well-coordinated \nmultidonors  package for  PSE  reforms  in  Pakistan. The  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \napproved a 3-year extended arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility in September 2013,12 \nwhich concluded in 2016. The World Bank approved four development policy credits in April 2014, \nMay 2015, June 2016, and in March 2017. These two programs also support some reforms \n(including privatization) relevant for PSEs in Pakistan. Subprogram 2 complements and carries \nforward similar reforms, especially in the areas of implementing corporate governance rules and \nprivatization.  \n \n9.  Lessons. The success of PSE reforms is critically dependent on public awareness of the \nreform process and its benefits. Strong government commitment and adequate support from all \nstakeholders are two important prerequisites for a successful PSE reform program; strong \ngovernment commitment is also one of the important prerequisites for successful program lending, \nespecially in Pakistan. Thus, setting realistic policy actions is crucial to ensure the government\u2019s \n                                                \n10 Privatization initiatives require that political parties, managers, unions, workers, civil servants, business leaders, \npotential investors, national and international civil society organizations, and consumers be informed about the \nprogram\u2019s operations and benefits (D. Calabrese. 2008. Strategic Communication for Privatization, Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships, and Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects. World Bank Working Paper. No.139. Washington, \nDC: World Bank). \n11 This was one of the major lessons of the recent privatization drive. \n12 The primary aim of the IMF program is macroeconomic stabilization, which  will require fiscal and monetary tightening \nto establish a sustainable fiscal path and reduce inflation. The program also includes structural reforms\u2014especially \nprivatization  of  some  federal  PSEs\u2014with  the  aim  of  increasing  economic  efficiency \n(https://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pr/2013/pr13322.htm). \n ", "4 \ncommitment.13 Similar  lessons  were  also  identified  for  the  World  Bank\u2019s  banking  sector \nrestructuring and privatization project and program.14 Some critical lessons from successful as \nwell as unsuccessful PSE reform episodes, including the recent initiatives, are incorporated in the \nproposed policy actions (para. 7). These lessons relate to a public awareness campaign,15 \nunfunded pension liabilities, and other important issues pertaining to PSE workers.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s value addition.16 Asian Development Bank (ADB) adds significant value to the \nprogrammatic  approach  by  (i)  facilitating  private  participation  in  PSEs;17 (ii)  improving  the \ntargeting of reform-related expenditures and their partial financing; (iii) enhancing coordination \nwith development partners in the design and execution of the programmatic approach; (iv) \nproviding technical assistance to improve the performance of PSEs such as Pakistan Railways; \nand (v) consolidating policy reforms in the transport and energy sectors, and thereby facilitating \nongoing and future ADB investments in those sectors. ADB also accommodates the government\u2019s \nongoing fiscal consolidation by providing affordable least-cost solutions critical to sustaining its \nreform initiatives. \n \n11.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategy. Subprogram 2 is part of the 2017 pipeline in the ADB \nCountry Operations and Business Plan (COBP), 2017\u20132019 for Pakistan.18 It will provide critical \nhelp to the government to address the significant policy challenges and adjustment costs of this \nagenda. It also complements ADB\u2019s public\u2013private partnership (PPP) initiatives in Pakistan and \nthe Railways Investment Program, which is under preparation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be reduced net fiscal transfers to PSEs from the federal budget.19 The \noutcome will be improved PSE performance.20 \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The outputs are as follows: \n(i)  Output 1: Policies to address labor issues and communication strategy \nintroduced,  and  costs  and  benefits  assessed.  Under  subprogram  1,  the \nPrivatization  Commission  Board  designed  the  communication  strategy  and \npolicies addressing issues pertaining to the workers\u2019 voluntary separation scheme, \nunfunded pensions, and skills training. Under subprogram 2, the government has \n                                                \n13 Independent  Evaluation  Department.  2013.

Islamabad. \n20 The impact and outcome statements remain the same for the entire program. \n ", "5 \nstarted implementing the strategy and related policies.21 In addition, a critical \ncomponent  of  subprogram  2  is  the  establishment  of  retirement  cost  funds \n(Retirement Cost Funds) for eight DISCOs to address their unfunded pension \nliabilities and other retirement benefit liabilities.22 The government exceeded the \noriginally targeted coverage of three DISCOs by approving the establishment and \nregistration of the Retirement Cost Funds as separate trusts with independent \nboard of trustees for eight DISCOs. While the National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority allows DISCOs to include retirement benefit costs in determining power \ntariffs, an outstanding legal dispute on the tariffs delayed the notification of the new \ntariff.  The government has agreed to provide a one-time budgetary allocation of \nPRs15 billion ($143 million equivalent) in FY2018\u2014identified as \u201cPSE Reform \n(Power Sector)\u201d\u2014to bridge the timing gap until the tariff dispute is resolved, \nthereby ensuring timely operationalization of the Retirement Cost Funds. Under \nsubprogram 2, the government will also design an information technology-based \nPSE performance monitoring system and provide a report that highlights the \nreform costs of and progress made under the programmatic approach. \n(ii)  Output 2: Financial transparency, monitoring, and corporate governance in \npublic sector enterprises improved. In line with the Public Sector Companies \n(Corporate  Governance)  Rules,  2013  (CGR),  the  Securities  and  Exchange \nCommission of Pakistan (SECP) issued corporate governance guidelines in 2013. \nThe main policy actions under this output are designed to facilitate improvements \nin compliance with CGR.23 Under subprogram 1, 35% of the companies complied \nwith CGR, and 50% will comply under subprogram 2.24 Various policy actions such \nas publishing quarterly reports and a list of noncompliant PSEs are proposed.25 \nThree critical policy actions will be implemented under subprogram 2 to improve \nPSE performance: (a) amending CGR to include all PSEs within its ambit,26 and to \nfacilitate stringent performance evaluation criteria for the chief executive officers \nand other senior board members; and (b) making selection of PSE board members \nmore transparent and effective. Policy actions to promote regular publication of a \nfinancial  performance  report  for  all  PSEs,  starting  from  FY2014,  have  been \nincluded under output 2. A financial performance report for federal PSEs was \npublished for FY2014 under subprogram 1 and the financial performance report \nfor FY2015 will be published under subprogram 2 with a gender disaggregated list \nof  PSE  board  members. Women  make  up  a  low  percentage  of  PSE  board \nmembers, and an important proposal is to implement a strategy to improve the \n                                                \n21 The Privatization Commission has initiated a large public awareness campaign involving (i) print and electronic \nmedia, (ii) international partnerships for building PSE competitiveness through knowledge and innovation, and (iii) \ncommunity outreach.  \n22 The eight DISCOs are (i) Faisalabad Electric Supply Company, (ii) Gujranwala Electric Power Company, (iii) \nHyderabad Electric Supply Company, (iv) Islamabad Electric Supply Company, (v) Lahore Electric Supply Company, \n(vi) Multan Electric Power Company, (vii) Peshawar Electric Supply Company, and (viii) Sukkar Electric Supply \nCompany. \n23 Good corporate governance facilitates economic efficiency, and companies' access to capital for long-term \ninvestment  (Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development.  G20/OECD  Principles  of  Corporate \nGovernance. http://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/principles-corporate-governance.htm). \n24 The Government of Pakistan has exceeded this requirement by ensuring almost 60% compliance rate for the \nCorporate Governance Rules as of April 2017. \n25 The Government of Pakistan has issued the Office Memorandum on 27 January 2017 to cover all PSEs under \nCorporate Governance Rules, 2013. The names of those PSEs who that not complying with Corporate Governance \nRules, 2013 are uploaded in the SECP website. \n26 Including those that are not registered under Companies Ordinance 1984. \n ", "6 \nlevel of women\u2019s representation on PSE boards under subprogram 2.27 \n(iii)  Output 3: Restructuring and reform of selected public sector enterprises \ninitiated. In support of output 3, Pakistan Railways accomplished the following six \npolicy actions under subprogram 1:28  \n(a)  strengthened its internal control and audit function by appointing a chief \ninternal auditor to lead the internal audit department and designing a road \nmap for strengthening the internal audit department, including a risk-based \naudit plan; \n(b)  initiated  phased  migration  to  an  internationally  recognized  set  of \naccounting standards (i.e., International Financial Reporting Standards); \n(c)  initiated a detailed study on departmental restructuring and workforce \nrationalization; \n(d)  commenced creation of a digital land asset database; \n(e)  created and operationalized a PPP unit to facilitate private participation in \nselect railways services; and \n(f)  initiated the process to improve transparency in the procurement of goods \nand services, and the establishment of effective internal controls. \n \n14.  All these policy actions will be supported under subprogram 2 to accomplish the desired \nresults. For example, Pakistan Railways will implement the risk-based audit for FY2017 and \noperationalize  the  process  for  private  participation  in  selected  railways  services  under \nsubprogram 2.29 Similarly, Pakistan Railways will complete the automation of a land database,30 \nand  implementation  of  selected  procurement  reforms.31 The  government  will  also  attempt \nrestructuring and/or privatization of some other PSEs under subprogram 2. Privatization of SME \nBank Ltd., is one such important reform initiative. Invitation for expressions of interest for \nacquisition of up to 93.88% shares of SME Bank Ltd., has already been advertised in national \nnewspapers  following  approval  of  the  transaction  structure  by  the  Cabinet  Committee  on \nPrivatization (CCOP) on 27 January 2017.32 \n                                                \n27 This proposal will require mandatory presence of a female member on the board of companies. In commercial PSCs, \n96% of the board members are male, and in noncommercial PSCs, 93% are male (footnote 3).  \n28 Pakistan Railways is one of the most important state institutions of Pakistan. However, its importance has declined. \nIn response, beginning in April 2014, Pakistan Railways has been implementing a comprehensive restructuring plan, \nwhich includes improvements in business processes, financial stability, and service delivery.  Appointment of the \nRailway Board was completed in February 2015 and strengthening of the company\u2019s financial accounting practices\u2014\nincluding moving from a cash to accrual basis accounting (International Financial Reporting Standards), reconciling \nland assets database, notifying an appropriate PPP framework, and focusing on improving the transparency and \nefficiency of the procurement process\u2014are currently supported by ADB to improve its long-term business prospects. \nRevenue performance is steadily improving\u2014during the first 6 months of FY2017 revenues were PRs18.6 billion \nagainst a target of PRs17.6 billion. This may be attributable to improvements in both freight and passenger \nbusinesses.  \n29 PPPs have already been introduced in three areas: commercial management of passenger trains, commercial \nmanagement of brake and luggage vans, and commercial management of cargo express trains. \n30 To improve use of land resources as part of the larger ambition of monetizing Pakistan Railway\u2019s commercial assets, \nits land assets database has been reconciled and automated under the programmatic approach. Information can \nnow be obtained in real time on each parcel of railway land with respect to status (self-occupied, encroached, or \nleased), with real-time geo-referenced geographic information system imagery. Pakistan Railways\u2019 land records are \nnow synchronized with federal and provincial land revenue records. \n31 Pakistan Railways has more than 100,000 staff (regular and contractual staff), making the task of departmental \nrestructuring and workforce rationalization both enormous and sensitive. Pakistan Railways has agreed to complete \nthe interim report on departmental restructuring and workforce rationalization by early June 2017. \n32 SME Bank is a public limited company incorporated in Pakistan on 30 October 2001 and was issued a banking \nlicense on 13 September 2004. However, private banks, with a share of 65%-70%, have always been the leading \nlenders in SME finance. \n ", "7 \n15.  There are sixteen policy actions under subprogram 2.33 Some policy actions relating to \nPakistan Railways under subprogram 2 will continue to be monitored and supported under the \nADB Railways Investment Program (under preparation).  \n \nD.

As an integral part of the ongoing fiscal consolidation initiatives\u2014which encompass \nmaintaining a moderate debt-to-GDP ratio and building fiscal buffers against adverse shocks\u2014\nthe government plans to lower the budget deficit (excluding grants) to 4.2% of GDP in FY2017 \nfrom 5.4% in FY2015, mainly through revenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. \nHowever, given the sluggish nature of revenue improvements over the short to medium term, the \nburden  of  fiscal  consolidation  will  primarily  fall  on  expenditure  rationalization,  especially \ndevelopment expenditures. As a result, it will be difficult to maintain, if not augment, the past trend \nof  development  expenditures  and  development  loans  (primarily  for  investment  to  augment \ncapacity) for PSEs (including Pakistan Railways). This is a clear illustration of a hard budget \nconstraint and its impact on development financing, given the rigidity in nondiscretionary recurrent \nexpenditures  (salary,  pensions,  and  interest).  The  government\u2019s  support  for  productive \ninvestments in PSEs needs to be revived, and will be supported under the program. \n \n17.  It will also be difficult for the government to incur additional costs to carry out PSE reforms, \nunless expenditures on specific items are targeted and partly financed by the government\u2019s \ndevelopment  partners.  Strong  expenditure  rationalization  efforts  will  be  needed  to  enable \nadditional reform-related expenditures, to the extent these are reflected in the federal budget, \nwithin the stipulated fiscal deficit targets. \n \n18.   Unfunded pension liability is a risk to a company's financial condition due to underfunding \nof defined benefit pension plan. Unfunded pensions and other retirement benefits are major \nconstraints for timely privatization (or strategic sale of shares) of DISCOs. Unless addressed \nefficiently, these will have an adverse impact on the government\u2019s divestment income from \nprivatization. Therefore, it is proposed that the government will help creating Retirement Cost \nFunds and encourage operationalization of these Funds.  Putting some of these items together \nand combining them with the government\u2019s commitment to reduce the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio, \ndevelopment financing needs of approximately $897 million over the entire program period (2016\u2013\n2018) is foreseen.34 The programmatic approach is expected to finance nearly 67% of this \ndevelopment financing requirement. Thus, the programmatic approach will help the government \nto pursue, without breaching the fiscal targets, its macroeconomic reform agenda, including PSE \nreforms.  \n \n19.   The government has requested a concessional loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n                                                \n33 Out of the 16 policy actions, 15 policy actions have already been complied with. The Ministry of Railways (MOR) is \nin the process of finalizing its interim report on departmental restructuring and workforce rationalization and will \napprove the key recommendations of this interim report before the Board consideration of subprogram 2. \n34 Based on detailed discussions with the government officials, it was agreed to support five major costs of reforms \nunder the programmatic approach (combining both Subprogram 1 and Subprogram 2): (i) support for revival of the \ngovernment support to PSEs for investment to augment capacity; (ii) funding of a retirement benefit fund to manage \nhuge unfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers, (iii) cost of vocational and other trainings, and (iv) \ncommunication cost. To facilitate private investment (strategic sales through IPOs), MOF has also incurred additional \ncost by providing financial assistance to selected DISCOs to settle the receivables in their balance sheets.    \n ", "8 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF), through its Finance Division, will continue to be the \nexecuting agency for subprogram 2. The program management unit (PMU) established under \nsubprogram 1 will be responsible for the overall coordination and reporting on implementation \narrangements. The Finance Division, MOR, Pakistan Railways, the Privatization Commission, \nand SECP will be the implementing agencies. \n \n21.  The PMU will assist the implementing agencies in the implementation of subprogram 2, \nand will conduct regular consultations to ensure timely completion of all policy actions. A senior \ngovernment official will serve as the program director. The PMU will be responsible for (i) \ncoordinating  and  monitoring  subprogram  2,  including  the  policy  actions;  (ii)  preparing  and \nsubmitting all required reports to the Finance Division and ADB; and (iii) submitting the necessary \nstatements and reports to ADB. \n \n22.  The implementation period for subprogram 2 is from 30 June 2017 to 30 June 2018. The \nproceeds of the loan will be disbursed upon fulfillment of the policy actions, to the satisfaction of \nADB, in accordance with (i) ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time \nto time), and (ii) simplified disbursement procedures for program loans.35 ADB will monitor the \nimplementation of subprogram 2 through periodic progress reports and will field regular missions \nto confirm fulfillment of the policy actions.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n23.  The beneficiaries will primarily be the domestic, industrial, agricultural, and commercial \nclients of public goods and services provided by PSEs, which will deliver improved services in a \ncost-effective manner. Taxpayers and recipients of government services will indirectly benefit \nfrom the reduced fiscal costs of PSEs. PSE staff are expected to benefit from a consistent and \nfair approach to retirement benefits, as set out in the program. \n \nA.  Economic \n24.  The beneficiaries of subprogram 2 will be the people of Pakistan, who will directly benefit \nfrom the improved delivery of services, especially in the areas of power and transportation. \nMoreover, subprogram 2 will facilitate government fiscal investments in social and economic \ninfrastructure,  which  will  result  in  improved  health  and  education  services  and  economic \nopportunities. In addition, subprogram 2 will stimulate private sector activity by partly substituting \ngovernment service commitments. The beneficial effect on federal finances will originate primarily \nfrom three sources: non-debt capital receipts (disinvestment income), reduced fiscal transfers, \nand higher dividend income. In addition, the government will reduce its contingent liabilities once \npensions and related retirement liabilities are funded appropriately.36 \n \nB.  Governance \n25.  Subprogram 2 has many policy actions that will promote good governance in public \nservice delivery. Improving internal audit, and accounting practices of Pakistan Railways are \ncovered under subprogram 2. Several initiatives will be introduced under the programmatic \napproach to (i) improve internal audit based on risk analysis, (ii) strengthen transparency in \n                                                \n35 ADB. 1998.

Many PSEs do not follow the SECP\u2019s Public Sector Companies (Corporate Governance) \nRules, 2013. The program has introduced relevant policy actions to facilitate compliance with \nthese rules, and subprogram 2 will ensure that all PSEs are covered under them. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, including the Finance Division of the MOF. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Subprogram 2 has a positive impact on poverty reduction and social issues, through two \ninterlinked  mechanisms.  First,  support  for  augmenting  and  sustaining  the  government\u2019s \ndevelopment financing will substantially impact human and income poverty. Second, many \nreforms will help the government reduce the economic and fiscal costs that Pakistan\u2019s PSEs \nimpose  on  consumers,  taxpayers,  and  beneficiaries  of  social  services.  Subprogram  2  will \nmaximize the benefits that private management and improved corporate and sector governance \ncan bring to the economic efficiency and financial feasibility of PSEs. These changes are \nexpected to improve access to basic services such as electricity (through power distribution \ncompanies) and public transportation (through railways). The PSEs to be restructured and \nprivatized may decrease their demand for low-skilled labor in the future. The programmatic \napproach will therefore facilitate critical initiatives, through the targeted policy actions, to address \nlabor issues, particularly related to retirement benefits and alternative skills development.37 The \nreform  measures  under  subprogram  2  will  in  turn  help  free  government  fiscal  resources, \nfacilitating higher public spending on social sectors, particularly health, education, and social \nprotection. Subprogram 2 has important gender impacts. Policy measures will support gender \ninclusiveness by ensuring mandatory representation of women on PSE boards, and mandate \nregular reporting of gender statistics of PSE boards.38 The mandatory presence of at least one \nfemale member on each PSE board under the approved change in the Companies Bill 2017 will \nincrease women\u2019s representation to at least 15% from the current low level of 4% (commercial \nPSCs) and 3% (noncommercial PSCs). \n \nD.  Safeguards \n29.  Given  the  nature  of  subprogram  2,  all  three  safeguard  categories  (environment, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples)  are  categorized  as  C.  Safeguards  due \ndiligence shows policy actions associated with subprogram 2 will not result in any involuntary \nresettlement or environmental impacts. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n30.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.39 The integrated benefits and impacts are \nexpected to outweigh the costs. \n \n                                                \n37 ADB is also proposing skills development programs through loan and TA projects in Pakistan. \n38 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n39 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nSummary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nContinued commitment of the government  Continuous engagement by Asian Development \ntowards reform measures envisaged under the  Bank (ADB) and development partners with all \nprogrammatic approach is not sustained.  levels of government, especially during the post-\nprogram period to highlight the importance of \nsustaining reform momentum to ensure (i) high \ngrowth, and (ii) long-term engagement with the \ndevelopment partners.   \nElections and political unrest may delay  Continuous engagement by ADB with all levels of \nconsolidation of some reforms affecting program  government and the incoming government. \noutputs.  \nTrained staff are not retained in the relevant line  Continuous engagement by ADB and development \ndepartments, complicating replication of their  partners with all levels of government to highlight \nvarious technical assignments after the  the importance of retaining quality human \ncompletion of the program.  resources to sustain reform initiatives. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITION \n31.  The government and MOF have assured ADB that implementation of subprogram 2 shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan documents. \n \n32.  It is a condition of loan effectiveness that ADB is satisfied that all policy actions set out in \nthe policy matrix in respect of subprogram 2 have been fully complied with.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $300,000,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 2 of the Public Sector \nEnterprises Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with \nan interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of \n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n                   \n \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \n                  President \n \n \n1 June 2017 \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Program is Aligned with \nNet fiscal transfers to PSEs from the federal budget reduced (Pakistan 2025: One Nation\u2013One Vision)a \n \nData Sources \nPerformance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nResults Chain  Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  a.
