It  will  use  a  two-tiered  strategy: \n(i) resolving cotton farm debt on a pilot scale, and (ii) improving cotton \nmarket  development.  The  Project  will  operate  on  a  pilot  level  in  four \nselected cotton-producing raions (districts) of Sughd and Khatlon regions, \nthe country\u2019s main cotton-producing areas. It will implement farm-by-farm \nanalysis, debt resolution processes, policy reform measures, and support \nfor  public  information  processes  as  well  as  provide  suitable  financing \nproducts and services to the restructured pilot cotton farms.  \n \nUnder the market development strategy, the Project will implement the \nadoption of the internationally recognized quality standard for fiber cotton, \nthe Universal Cotton Grade Standards, by (i) facilitating an internationally \naccredited  organization  to  classify  all  cotton  grown  in  the  country; \n(ii) facilitating revision of the fiber cotton export pricing formula as applied \nby  the  Tajikistan  Universal  Goods  Exchange  (TUGE)  to  reflect  quality \ndifferences  in  fiber  cotton;  (iii)  streamlining  the  regulatory  role  of  the \nTajikstandard; and (iv) providing an extensive awareness program on the \nnew  standard  for  all  stakeholders.  The  Project  will  also  facilitate  the \nestablishment  of  two  bonded  warehouses  that  meet  international \nstandards and that will be operated by the private sector. \n \nRationale  Tajikistan\u2019s economic growth is not sustainable because it relies on a \nnarrow export base (aluminum, cotton, and hydropower) and remittances \nfrom migrant labor. In 2005, economic growth declined to 6.7%, adversely \naffected by sluggish export prices and significant cotton farm debt.  \n \nThe cotton subsector has been underperforming as yields and profitability \ncontinue to decline. At the farm level, the average yield in 2005 was only \n1.55 tons per hectare (tph)\u20141.25 tph short of the yield level required for \ncotton farms to earn reasonable profits. Labor productivity has also fallen. \nIt takes 250\u2013350 hours to produce 1 ton of seed cotton, more than four \ntimes the international competitive level of 70\u201380 hours.  ", "iv \n  The weak subsector performance is due in part to the large and increasing \ncotton farm debt, presently estimated at $292.80 million. Debt per hectare \nranges from $500 to over $8,000. The debt was incurred under a complex \nsystem of production credit from intermediaries called \u201cinvestors\u201d, and was \nsupplied largely outside the formal banking system. Commercial banks \nand other financial institutions in Tajikistan have not been able to provide \nservices to the subsector because of accumulated farm debts, and very \nlimited credit resources and capacity for lending to agriculture.   \n \nSustainable resolution of the farm debt problem requires addressing the \nsymptom (i.e., debt at the farm level) as well as the underlying cause \n(government interference). Full recovery of the subsector will need the \nremoval  of  government  interventions  that  distort  key  operations  in  the \nsubsector\u2019s value chain and make the chain ineffective.  \n \nAn unprofitable cotton subsector is inextricably linked to poverty. About \n72% of all the poor in the country and 75% of the extreme poor live in \nKhatlon and Sughd. Cotton farmers and farm workers constitute the bulk \nof the rural labor force and the rural poor.  \n \nThere is an urgent need to support the recovery of the cotton subsector \nand reduce rural poverty. The subsector\u2019s turnaround is the agriculture \nsector\u2019s path to equitable-based and pro-poor growth. The Government \nhas responded to the problems afflicting the subsector by (i) developing a \ncomprehensive Cotton Farm Debt Resolution Strategy (CFDRS) with a \ntime-bound  and  results-based  action  plan,  and  (ii)  establishing  an \nIndependent Commission (IC) of cabinet-level officials to deal with the \nissues. The President of Tajikistan is leading the reform process and has \nagreed with the international community to develop a road map for the \nsustainable  development  of  the  cotton  subsector  and  the  agriculture \nsector.  \n \nThe Project intends to build on the Government\u2019s commitment to genuine \ndevelopment change by addressing the crucial and immediate concerns \naffecting  the  cotton  subsector:  (i)  accumulating  farm  debt,  (ii)  policy \nconstraints  to  producer\u2019s  incentives,  (iii)  inadequate  alternative  crop \nfinancing, and (iv) structural bottlenecks that create market distortions in \nthe downstream section of the value chain. The grant component of the \nProject will assist the Government in addressing the farm debt issue and \nthe  structural  problems,  while  minimizing  the  negative  impact  on  the \npresent role of cotton as a major source of government revenue, and \nemployment and income to the vast majority of the rural poor. The loan \ncomponent of the Project will try out crop financing through the commercial \nbanks, establish the joint venture with an internationally recognized cotton \ngrading controller, and upgrade bonded warehouses that will be operated \nby the private sector. The Project is classified as general intervention \nbecause  addressing  these  gaps  will  enable  cotton  farms  to  reap  the \npotential benefits of a vertically integrated value chain, and significantly \nreduce rural poverty.   \n \n ", "v \nImpact and  The  Project\u2019s  expected  impact  is  the  development  of  an  economically \nOutcome  sustainable  cotton  subsector  in  Tajikistan\u2019s  two  major  cotton-growing \nregions, Khatlon and Sughd (Appendix 1). Its outcome is for the debt-\nrestructured  cotton  farms  in  Vose  and  Yovon  raions  of  Khatlon  and \nMastchoh and Zafarabad raions in Sughd to sustainably improve their \nfinancial viability based on market principles. \n \nProject  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $15.29 million, including \nInvestment Plan   taxes and duties of $0.68 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance $12.00 million equivalent, comprising $5.50 million equivalent from \nAsian Development Fund (ADF) sources and $6.50 million equivalent in an \nADF IX grant. The Government will finance $1.75 million equivalent, and \nprivate sector institutions will provide $1.54 million equivalent. \n \nFinancing Plan  A loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 3,712,000 ($5.50 million \nequivalent) will be provided from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The \nloan will have a 32-year term including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest rate of 1.00% per annum during the grace period and 1.50% \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the Financing \nAgreement. In addition, an ADF IX grant for $6.50 million will be provided \nfor (i) the farm resolution in four pilot areas; (ii) policy development and \nadvocacy;  (iii)  capacity  building  and  consulting  services  for  market \ndevelopment, debt workouts, and agriculture financing innovations; and \n(iv) operations of the Common Center for Project Management. \n \nAllocation and  For measures under agriculture financing innovation, the Government will \nRelending Terms  relend about $3 million of the ADF loan funds in U.S. dollars for a 7-year \nperiod,  including  a  grace  period  of  2  years,  under  subsidiary  loan \nagreements with participating commercial banks (PCBs). The interest rate \ncharged will be 4%. The PCBs will assume the exchange rate and credit \nrisk, and onlend to farmers in somoni using market-based interest rates.   \n \nPeriod of  Until 30 September 2010 \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The IC will operate as the project steering committee to provide policy \nArrangements  guidance and reform support during the Project, and facilitate coordination \nand cooperation among the major stakeholders. The Common Center for \nProject Management (CCfPM) of the IC will serve as the Implementing \nAgency  (IA)  for  the  farm  debt  resolution  and  the  agriculture  financing \ninnovation, while the Ministry of Agriculture will be the IA for the market \ndevelopment aspects of the Project. A project implementation unit under \nthe CCfPM will be jointly established with the World Bank\u2019s upcoming \nCotton Recovery and Poverty Reduction Project and it will be responsible \nfor the day-to-day implementation and coordination of the Project. \n \nExecuting  Executive Office of the President \nAgency \n \n ", "vi \nProcurement   Procurement of $7 million of goods, related services, and civil works will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nConsulting  The  Project  will  provide  a  total  of  1,269  person-months  of  consulting \nServices  services, comprising 62 person-months of international consultants and \n1,207  person-months  of  national  consultants.  Unallocated  30  person-\nmonths will be used to finance consulting services for policy and market \ndevelopment issues to be identified in the ensuing road map for the cotton \nsubsector. The international consultants will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants will be \nselected under five consulting firm contracts: (i) quality-based selection \n(QBS) for the farm debt resolution in pilot raions; (ii) quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  (QCBS)  for  market  development  measures  and \nawareness training on cotton grading; (iii) modified and/or simplified QCBS \nfor nongovernment organizations to undertake awareness raising during \nfarm  debt  workouts,  and  develop  the  project  performance  monitoring \nsystem and gender action plan; (iv) independent selection for the center \ndirector; and (v) least-cost selection for the auditing firm. QBS will be used \nfor the farm debt to ensure a good mix of highly qualified experts with a \ntrack record on debt resolution. Resolving farm debt quickly is a high \npriority  on  the  agenda  of  the  Government,  because  of  its  adverse \nimplications  on  the  sustainability  of  the  cotton  subsector  and  the \nagriculture sector in general.  \n \nProject Benefits  The main impact will be on cotton farmers, who will obtain benefits from \nand Beneficiaries  farmer\u2019s control over farm decision making, increased quality measures, \nimproved  prices,  access  to  credit  from  commercial  banks,  and  a \nsignificantly greater proportion of the overall value of the cotton marketed. \nGreater certainty for buyers and more competition among cotton gins for \nthe purchase of fiber cotton produced in Tajikistan will reinforce higher \nprices.  Farm  workers  will  be  paid  in  cash  wages,  not  in-kind.  The \nGovernment will receive higher tax revenues from the subsector. Benefits \nresulting  from  the  farm-by-farm  analysis  and  resolution  will  include \nfinancially  viable  farms  in  participating  raions,  with  a  flow-on  effect  of \npositive models for indebted farms to use in other raions. The conservative \nestimate of project impact on national poverty reduction is 3%, but it could \nbe as high as 7\u201310%. \n \nRisks and  The main risks relating to the Project are inadequate commitment to and \nAssumptions  engagement in reform-based activities. Local governments and investors \nin the pilot raions may create obstacles to resolution, and Tajikstandard \nand other government bodies may resist changes to cotton grading and \npricing.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  information  dissemination, \ncommunications  for  the  establishment  of  strategic  alliances,  capacity \nbuilding, policy work and advocacy, and engagement of and reinforcement \nby national government at the highest levels. As commercial banks may \nhesitate to innovate in cotton lending, the relending rate will be set so that \nit is attractive for PCBs to innovate and absorb the lending risks.   \n \n ", "vii \n  The main assumption of the Project relates to the Government\u2019s continued \ncommitment to implement essential medium-term measures, particularly \nup-scaling  the  debt  resolution  process  at  a  subsector-wide  level,  and \nputting  into  place  the  medium-term  policy  and  institutional  reforms  as \noutlined  in  the  CFDRS  and  the  upcoming  road  map  for  sustainable \ndevelopment.  The  donor  community  is  making  concerted  efforts  in \nmonitoring  the  implementation  of  the  CFDRS  and  the  road  map,  and \nproviding additional support to the Government to implement the medium-\nterm commitments. Additionally, Tajikistan\u2019s representatives to the World \nBank and ADB, who serve as members of the IC, will continue to influence \nthe IC to bring about the necessary reform measures. \n \n ",

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Sustainable Cotton \nSubsector Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE,  PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  Tajikistan is a small, mountainous, landlocked country whose geographic location and \nhistory present formidable barriers to sustainable growth. Of the total area of 14.3 million \nhectares (ha), only 4.3 million ha is agricultural land and only 0.8 million ha is arable. Seventy \npercent of Tajikistan\u2019s 6.4 million people live in rural areas, with land availability of 0.21 ha per \nperson. The main exports, cotton and aluminum, are transported through Uzbekistan1 and the \nKyrgyz Republic. The country\u2019s transport costs of its produce are influenced by its political and \neconomic relations with these countries.  \n \n3.  Tajikistan has a narrow economic base,2 with the agriculture sector providing the major \nsource of livelihood for more than 64% of the country\u2019s population. Agricultural growth during \nthe post-civil war recovery years of 1998\u20132004 was a significant factor in improving internal \nsecurity and ensuring political stability. In 2004, sector output generated 22% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP), 20% of exports, 67% of employment, and 39% of tax revenues. Rural poverty \nincidence declined from 83% in 1999 to 64% in 2003. However, this growth is not sustainable \nbecause of lack of crop diversity, a narrow export base, and structural barriers that limit market \ncompetition.  \n \n4.  Crop production, which accounts for 74% of agricultural output, is dominated by the \ncotton subsector. Cotton is grown on 50% of the country\u2019s irrigated farmland. In 2004, the cotton \nsubsector provided 60% of the value of total agriculture output, 75% of agriculture trade, 18% of \ntotal export receipts, and about 35% of tax revenues. Cotton incomes supported 75% of farm \nhouseholds  and  75%  of  Tajikistan\u2019s  poor  and  extremely  poor  households.  Its  significant \ncontribution to rural livelihoods, government revenues, and export incomes makes it key to \nTajikistan\u2019s overall development.  Appendix 2 contains a more detailed subsector analysis. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n5.  The cotton subsector is underperforming. At the farm level, average yield in 2005 was \nestimated at 1.55 tons per ha (tph), down from 2.80 tph in 1991, and only 55% of the yield \nrequired for reasonable profits. It takes 250\u2013350 person-hours to produce 1 ton of seed cotton \nin Tajikistan, more than four times the international competitive level. Input use has been \nsuboptimal because of untimely delivery of vital inputs, a rise in input costs, poor input quality \n(especially seed), and lack of access to appropriate forms of credit. Irrigation facilities have \ndeteriorated and service delivery has been inefficient. Salinity and waterlogging problems have \nworsened and land quality has declined because of improper water and land use. Finally, \nexternal factors contributing to the problem include declines in the world prices for fiber cotton \nand increasing prices of production inputs such as fuel, fertilizer, and minerals. \n \n6.  Agriculture sector growth is hampered by the huge existing debt burdens of the majority \nof cotton farms. Since commercial banks in Tajikistan have had very limited resources and \ncapacity for lending to agriculture, there are virtually no formal financial sector mechanisms for \nfinancing crop production. Accordingly, a number of local agents referred in the country as \n                                                 \n1  About 95% of Tajikistan\u2019s exports pass through the rail link via Uzbekistan.  \n2  Aluminum, cotton, and fruit and vegetables account for 40% of gross domestic product (GDP). Cotton, aluminum, \nand electricity generate about 86% of the country\u2019s export revenues.    ", "2 \n\u201cinvestors\u201d (or futures traders) have provided virtually all seasonal lending through production \ncontract agreements for cotton, supplying in-kind credit to farmers at 12-18% per annum, and \nbeing  repaid  in  fiber  cotton  produced.  The  investors  have  been  important  credit  outlets, \nproviding about 75\u201385% of the credit needs of cotton farms. However, their business and \nlending practices have created significant problems in farm debt repayment.   \n \n7.  Total outstanding cotton seasonal production debt carryover from previous years\u2019 loans \nwas estimated at $292.80 million in January 2006.3 This is equivalent to over three full seasons \nof financing.4 Debt per ha ranges from $500 to over $8,000. However, these per ha debt levels \nin  Tajikistan  do  not  reflect  a  farm\u2019s  ability  to  pay,  the  actual  amount  borrowed,  and  the \nrepayment levels. The actual amounts which creditors claim that farmers owe them are widely \ndisputed.   \n \n8.  Prices received by cotton farmers are much lower than their counterparts receive in \nother cotton producing countries. The ratio of ex-gin price of fiber cotton to the cost, insurance, \nfreight (CIF) price of cotton received by a Tajik farmer is 52% while Australian farmers receive \n90\u201392%. Lower prices and price shares are due to the distorted and imperfect arrangements in \ncotton  processing  and  marketing.  The  most  serious  impediments  are  the  inefficiencies  of \nginneries, weak marketing systems, and the underpricing and undervaluation of baled cotton. \nAlthough 42 privately run ginneries5 are in operation in the country in 2006, the majority have \nlow outturn averages (22\u201332%).6 Structural limitations include lack of investment in ginning \ntechnology\u2014half of the ginneries were built over 50 years ago\u2014and limited access to electricity \nduring the peak ginning season.7 Inefficiencies of ginneries are also due to lack of competition, \nwhich is a result of the debt repayment mechanisms and restricted movement of cotton between \ndistricts. Because of their monopsony8 position, ginners tend to extract rents from the farms. In \naddition,  the  current  cotton  classification  and  grading  standard  systems  are  inadequate  to \ndetermine true baled cotton quality, forcing down the price received by farmers for their seed \ncotton and/or fiber cotton.  \n \n9.  An unprofitable cotton subsector is inextricably linked to poverty. While recent growth \nrates  have  resulted  in  the  reduction  of  poverty  incidence,  the  proportion  of  poor  rural \nhouseholds remains highest in Sughd and Khatlon. About 65% of the total population lives in \nthese two oblasts (regions). The probability of being poor is higher in these two cotton-growing \nareas than in the other regions.9 Cotton farm workers constitute the bulk of the rural labor force \nand the rural poor. More than 75% of the estimated 400,000 farm workers in the subsector are \n                                                 \n3  Letter from the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) dated 4 May 2006. This \ntotal did not discount the outstanding stocks of cotton not yet shipped or sold, valued at about $80 million, of which \npart will be used for repayments. KreditInvest, the main financial intermediary of the largest investors, advised that \ntheir total seasonal debt is $80 million for the 2005 crop, and $220 million for past due debt. It has $180 million in \noutstanding external contracts. \n4  To date, accurate information on the scale, structure, composition, and age of the farm debt is still incomplete and \nwill need to be verified on a farm-by-farm basis. For example, total farm debt figures reported by NBT were \n$20 million lower than ADB estimates (ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to Tajikistan for the Farm Debt Resolution \nand Policy Reforms. Manila). \n5  Virtually all ginneries are owned or operated by investors.  \n6  Outturn refers to the ratio by weight between the seed cotton provided to the gin and the fiber cotton produced for \nsale. In Australia and the People\u2019s Republic of China, the outturn is 38\u201340%. In the Kyrgyz Republic and \nKazakhstan, ginneries operate at 34\u201336% outturns.  \n7  Power access in rural areas from October to April is often cut to 2 hours per day. While 60% of ginneries have \ndedicated power lines and some run on diesel, the average ginning time is over 7 months, twice that of other \nproducers. \n8  Monopsony means single buyer. \n9  Abdulai, A. 2005.

Unresolved Farm Debt and Structural Constraints. Since 1998, cotton farm debts \nhave been accumulating. Lenders have not responded to the usual market signals of non-\nrepayment by slowing down cotton lending, and there have been no efforts to consider farms\u2019 \ncapacity to repay on a sustainable basis. This has been largely due to a confluence of internal \nfactors: (i) government interference in production decision, (ii) lopsided production contracting \narrangements, and (iii) lack of enforcement of regulations. \n \n11.  The  cotton  subsector  has  a  strategic  role  in  generating  fiscal  revenues,  so  the \nGovernment has maintained a strong hold on the key operations in the subsector\u2019s value chain. \nEach year, the Government develops national and raion (district) cotton production forecasts. \nThe rais (local governors) who are appointed directly by the President of Tajikistan are held \naccountable  for  ensuring  that  farms  meet  the  forecasts  in  their  jurisdiction.  To  meet  the \nproduction targets, the rais require farmers to cultivate cotton in at least 70% of their farmland. \nThe rais has significant influence over farmers because of their authority to revoke farmers\u2019 land \nuse certificates on the basis of the \u201cirrational use\u201d of agriculture land as stated in the Land \nCode.11 Tax revenues at the district level are tied to the amount of fiber cotton specified in that \ndistrict, so local governments grant monopsony rights to investors and gins to keep all seed and \nfiber cotton sales and ginning in the local raion. \n \n12.  An uncompetitive market environment in input financing encourages the use of lopsided \nproduction contract agreements that favor the investor to the detriment of the farmer. The \nproduction loan contract does not stipulate the price of raw cotton and inputs, and does not \npenalize the investor for late input delivery or a less-than-technically-optimal amount or quality \nof inputs. The problem is further aggravated by the lack of transparency or accountability of farm \nassociation  managers  and/or  accountants  to  farm  owners  and  members  for  financial \narrangements. \n \n13.  The debt problems of the cotton subsector are exacerbated by lack of enforcement of \nregulations  of  the  National  Bank  of  Tajikistan  (NBT)  for  KreditInvest  on  its  cotton  lending \noperations  through  (i)  inadequate  legal  mechanisms  and  court  systems  to  address  debt \ndisputes, (ii) inadequate systems of accounting for bad debt in investor businesses, and (iii) the \nassumption that the Government would deal with the debt overhang as it had done in previous \nperiods.12   \n \n14.  The net effect of accumulating cotton farm debt on farmers has been devastating. The \nusual incentives to improve productivity and maximize net returns do not work because of the \ncomplex  web  of  rent-extractive  market  arrangements.  Many  farmers  produce  cotton  only \nbecause they are instructed to do so by local governments which have control over the farmers\u2019 \n                                                 \n10 Oxfam (United Kingdom). 2005. \u2018White Gold\u2019 or Women\u2019s Grief?

A report prepared by Payam Foroughi for Oxfam (United Kingdom).  \n11  The Chairman of the State Land Commission advised that 2\u20133 farms per raion per year are taken over, fully or \npartially, by hukumats (district governments), or about 20% of the average total number of farms per raion. Around \n15% of total land in a raion is designated as \u201creserve\u201d for the sole disposition of the rais. Land is also traded \nbetween individual raions. \n12 International Monetary Fund Country Report No. 06/63, Republic of Tajikistan- Ex Post Assessment of Longer \nTerms Program Engagement, Washington, D.C.

The Paper noted that public financial assistance through a \ngovernment guarantee of the private loan provided by Rhinehart (one of the major fiber cotton importers) should \nhave been monitored properly to ensure its transparent channeling in the budget.  \n ", "4 \nland use rights, and because cotton is the only crop for which farmers can borrow funds to \nproduce.  Thus,  cotton  yields  in  recent  years  have  not  only  been  low  but  have  shown  a \nfluctuating trend.  \n \n15.  Lack of Alternative Rural Financing Mechanisms. Access to seasonal production \ncredit for cotton is a critical input for the sustained growth of the cotton subsector. The banking \nsector in Tajikistan is extremely small, with only $160 million in total outstanding assets as of \nMarch 2006 and a deposit-to-GDP ratio of 4%. With a delinquency rate of 36% on its 13.4% of \ntotal portfolio in agriculture, formal financial institutions are understandably cautious in lending to \nagriculture. Lending to the agricultural sector has been effectively frozen because of heavy farm \ndebt levels and related liquidity and institutional capacity restrictions. It will be impossible to \ngenerate agricultural financing from international financial organizations and the private sector \nunless cotton farm debt is resolved in a transparent and voluntary manner between creditors \nand farmers. Banks and other financial institutions expect to develop capability to lend to \nagriculture  over  the  next  2\u20133  years,  but  currently  there  are  neither  funds  nor  institutional \ncapacity in the financial market to provide full sector financing.      \n \n16.  Farm  Restructuring  in  Tandem  with  Farm  Debt  Reallocation.  The  breakup  of \ncollective state farms into private farms, with active farmers holding land use right certificates, is \nan important component of the agricultural reform program. The farm restructuring process has \nresulted in an increase of cotton farms, from 658 farms at year-end 2002 to over 22,000 farms \nin early 2006. While the initial phase of farm restructuring is practically complete, no systematic \nattention has been given to the reassignment or assumption of public or private farm debt \nobligations. Under a Presidential Decree, private debt was reassigned on a per-irrigated hectare \nbasis after consideration of machinery and other non-land asset distribution. As of 1 October \n2005, approximately 61% of restructured farms had signed debt reallocation agreements, and \nthe  process  is  ongoing.  However,  the  debt  reallocation  process  was  undertaken  without \nreviewing the accuracy of debt, without reference to the new farm\u2019s capacity to repay the \nassigned debt, and with inadequate attention to distribution of other farm assets. Debt-related \ndata  on  larger  farms  have  not  been  reflected  in  the  newly  subdivided  farms,  making \nreconstructions of debt history difficult. This will complicate investor capacity to engage with and \nmanage farm debtors, and will also significantly increase the size and complexity of farm debt \nresolution.    \n \n17.  Cotton  Grading  Classification  System  and  Price  Setting.  Current  Tajikstandard \nclassification systems and practices in cotton grading do not adequately reflect the quality of \ncotton and the price differential that can be obtained in the marketplace. The pricing formula \nfurther  exerts  a  downward  push  on  the  price  of  baled  cotton.  The  Government,  through \nTajikistan\u2019s Universal Goods Exchange (TUGE), sets the export price formula by adjusting the \nCIF to the free on board (FOB) price of fiber cotton with higher nonmarket cost deductions and \nbased on a lower cotton grade. This results in revenue losses to exporters and farmers. Poor \nexport pricing mechanisms, inadequate grading systems, and poor market infrastructure cost \nthe country a minimum of $14 million a year in lost income. A new approach to classification and \nissuance  of  grade  certificates  as well  as  improvements  in  marketing  infrastructure,  pricing \nsystems, and mechanisms are needed to (i) increase the confidence of external buyers in the \nquality of fiber cotton sold, and (ii) improve the price received for Tajik fiber cotton.   \n \n18.  Response from Government. In March 2005, the President of Tajikistan approved the \nCotton Farm Debt Resolution Strategy (CFDRS, Supplementary Appendix A). The strategy \nfocuses first on resolving the immediate and urgent problem of a huge debt overhang through \nthe facilitation of debt workouts between private lenders and private borrowers. The proposed \npolicy reforms include (i) removal of the cotton targets or implicit quotas; (ii) securing of land \ntenure;  (iii)  establishing  international  grading  standards;  (iv)  giving  farmers  the  freedom  to \n ", "5 \nchoose what to grow and where to sell; and (v) creating a competitive, market-driven agricultural \nlending system. The strategy calls for the establishment of the Independent Commission (IC) to \noversee its implementation; this has been completed along with the action plan for the IC \napproved by the Prime Minister in September 2005.  \n \n19.  The President of Tajikistan has taken the lead in overseeing the implementation of the \nCFDRS. He has requested quarterly meetings with officials from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and World Bank to discuss the progress on the resolution of farm debt (Supplementary \nAppendix A). The President has also endorsed the development of a cotton subsector road map \nthat  will  allow  the  Government  and  all  concerned  stakeholders  to  keep  track  of  concrete \nprogress in resolving the farm debts and addressing other related sector reform issues, as \nidentified in the CFDRS and the action plan, in a realistic time frame. The road map is currently \nbeing developed by the Government and the international community (Supplementary Appendix \nB). \n \n20.  Lessons.  The  Project  will  build  on  lessons  from  (i)  other  experiences  from \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States  (CIS)  countries  on  post-independence  farm  debt \nresolution, (ii) international cotton organizations for marketing support structures and pricing \nmechanisms, and (iii) ADB\u2019s initial work on this issue in 2003 and thereafter. In successful \ncases  in  Moldova  and  Ukraine,  the  debt  restructuring  process  included  the  use  of  a \nmultidisciplinary team to complete in-depth analyses of the farms\u2019 financial and productive \ncapacity to determine their capacity to pay the debt. A policy team supplemented field team \noperations to ensure ongoing agriculture reforms as required. Farm debt laws were developed \nusing lessons from the farm-by-farm analysis. Participatory dissemination of information to \nmajor stakeholders about the debt process was also an important feature of that debt resolution \nprocess  (see  Supplementary  Appendix  C  for  details  and  other  country  experiences). \nAdditionally, the experiences of countries that are members of international cotton associations \nhighlight the benefits of (i) applying internationally recognized cotton classification standards, (ii) \nthe use of transparent and independent classification firms, (iii) appropriate marketing facilities \nsuch as bonded warehousing, and (iv) the application of a market-based export pricing system \nand pricing mechanisms.13 The cotton subsector cases of Kyrgyz Republic, People\u2019s Republic \nof China, and Kazakhstan highlight the high-income shares that farmers can receive from \nefficient market-based operations at the farm, ginnery, and input provision levels. ADB and \nWorld Bank projects on pilot-testing policy reforms of fixed and lower quotas for cotton and \nwheat in a few districts in Uzbekistan14show positive improvements in yield and economic \nreturns of farmers, and changing mindsets among hukumats (district governments) regarding \nthe necessity of production quotas.    \n \n21.  Response  of  the  Donor  Community.  Donor  coordination  is  particularly  strong  in \nTajikistan, with 12 donors and numerous international nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nresponding to issues under the CFDRS such as legal rights awareness, arbitration processes, \nand advice on farm management practices. Work to address the major policy concerns is also \nbeing completed, especially in the areas of land reform, improved water management, financial \ninstitution supervision capacity, and microfinance institutional strengthening to enable more \nagricultural  lending.  Together  with  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s  Department  for  International \n                                                 \n13 The large majority of international companies, spinning associations, and cotton associations have adopted the \nuniversal cotton grading standards. Examples include the Committee of International Cooperation between Cotton \nAssociations, International Cotton Advisory Committee, and East India Cotton Association. \n14 ADB. 2001.

Appendix 3 provides a \nsummary of the support provided by the donor community. The detailed matrix of donor support \nto the agriculture and rural sector development is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n22.  Response of ADB. The country strategy and program15 emphasizes rural development. \nThe  attainment  of  broad-based  growth  of  the  cotton  subsector  is  key  to  achieving  rural \ndevelopment  and  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  comprehensive  work  on  farm  debt  under  the \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Farm  Debt  Resolution  and  Policy  Reforms16 highlighted  the \ncomplex issue of the cotton debt overhang, its debilitating impact on the rural economy, and the \nurgent need for a holistic approach to cotton subsector development. This study and other \nfollow-on analysis resulted in recommendations for a combination of policy, investment, and \ninstitutional reforms. When implemented together, these reforms\u2014now known as the IC action \nplan of the CFDRS\u2014will ensure sustainable improvements in the overall cotton subsector. The \nTA for Farm Analysis and Awareness-Raising for Debt Resolution17 will undertake initial tasks \nunder the action plan with DfID and World Bank projects.   \n \n23.  There is an urgent need to support the recovery of the cotton subsector. Key financing \ngaps  in  the  immediate  term  are  accumulating  farm  debt,  policy  constraints  to  producer\u2019s \nincentives, new forms of crop financing, and structural bottlenecks that create distortions in the \nprocessing and marketing sides of the value chain. Addressing these gaps will enable cotton \nfarms to reap the potential benefits of a vertically integrated value chain and significantly reduce \nrural poverty. The Project will address these areas. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n24.  The Project\u2019s expected impact is the development of an economically sustainable cotton \nsubsector in Tajikistan\u2019s two major cotton-producing regions, Khatlon and Sughd. Its outcome is \nfor the debt-restructured cotton farms in Vose and Yovon raions of Khatlon and Mastchoh and \nZafarabad raions in Sughd to sustainably improve their financial viability based on market \nprinciples. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Appendix 4 discusses the \nProject\u2019s chronology of processing schedule. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n25.  The Project will provide three key outputs to achieve the desired outcome. The two key \noutputs in the four selected cotton-producing raions are that (i) the strategies, policy measures, \nand mechanisms to effectively address and resolve indebtedness of cotton farms are in place; \nand (ii) participating commercial banks (PCBs) provide suitable financing products and services \nto the debt-restructured cotton farms. At the supply chain\u2019s marketing level, the Project\u2019s third \noutput is putting into effect grading and marketing regulations, a joint venture (JV) established \nby the Government with an internationally recognized cotton classification organization, and \nbonded warehousing of cotton following international standards. To support the delivery of the \noutputs, an effective Common Center for Project Management (CCfPM) will be established.  \n \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2005.

The main activities for the first output \nare (i) farm-by-farm analysis; (ii) debt resolution processes, including facilitated farmer-creditor \nnegotiations; (iii) policy measures for debt resolution; and (iv) support for public information \nprocesses. Supplementary Appendix C contains a more detailed discussion of the farm debt \nresolution process. Based on criteria agreed between the Government and ADB, the IC has \nselected Vose and Yovon in Khatlon region, and Mastchoh and Zafarabad in Sughd regions as \nthe raions where the farm debt resolution process will be undertaken. Khamadon and Jami \nraions in Khatlon are set aside as reserve areas if the Project is able to expand to these raions \n(Supplementary Appendix E presents the criteria for the selection of the raions). The IC will \nensure  that  the  rais  in  the  selected  raions  will  provide  full  support  to  the  teams  from \ncommencement of any work in the raions. \n \n27.  A multidisciplinary team will be mobilized for each raion to handle the farm-by-farm \nanalysis and debt resolution process in the four designated raions. The teams will work on \nparticipating farms with investors and farmers to create an accurate picture of the debt level and \nfarm operations. Based on the findings, a trained negotiating team will work with the raion-\nbased mobile teams to assist farm management and farm owners in negotiating with creditors a \nmutually agreed restructuring and settlement of the farm\u2019s cotton debt which takes into account \nthe validated debt levels and the farm\u2019s capacity to repay. The parties will conclude with a legal \nand binding agreement that provides the details of the debt restructuring. In cases where a legal \nagreement is not reached, the parties will be advised to proceed to third party arbitration, go to \ncourt, or agree to let the farm voluntarily file for insolvency. The mobile teams will also work with \nfarm  management  and  workers  to  prepare  a  realistic  business  plan  that  includes  farm \noperations and management, a marketing plan, and financial arrangements.  \n \n28.  A support team will be established in Dushanbe to provide guidance on complex issues \nduring farm reviews and negotiations. It will also provide the IC with policy support through \npolicy studies18 and policy recommendations on debt-related and poverty and social issues. To \nupscale the farm debt assessment and resolution processes, a farm debt resolution manual, \nincluding  protocols  and  procedures  that can  be  applied  sector-wide, will  be  developed  for \nconsideration by the IC. A computer-based financial farm operations model that can cover a \nwide  range  of  farm  debt  situations  and  farm  types  will  complement  the  manual.  The \ncomputerized program can be used in negotiating with investors to secure broad agreements on \ndebt resolution for a group of farms in a raion, thus speeding the process of debt resolution. \n \n29.  A public outreach, communication, and education team will be established. It will assist \nthe teams and the IC to build strategic alliances in support of the reform measures, and ensure \nthat all stakeholders have sufficient information about the processes of market development and \nfarm debt resolution to make responsible choices and act appropriately. Key activities include: \n(i)  dialogues  and  consultation  meetings  by  the  President  of  Tajikistan,  IC,  and  the  donor \ncommunity with major stakeholders who may resist the reforms; (ii) dissemination of early \nsuccesses in farm debt resolution, such as stories of investors, gin owners, and rais who \ninitiated innovative and responsible schemes; and (iii) an awareness program to ensure that all \ncotton farmers have access to relevant information about the new classification and market \nregulations and/or pricing arrangements. \n \n                                                 \n18 Priority areas for policy work may include legal basis for an omnibus farm debt resolution act, amendment to the \nbankruptcy law, cotton tax reforms, and options for write down of debt. \n ", "8 \n30.  Agriculture  Financing Innovation.19 Under subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs), the \nGovernment will relend a total of $3 million20 to PCBs21 for onlending under subloans to debt \nresolved farms. Each SLA will have a term of 7 years including a two-year grace period, SLA \ninterest at 4% per annum,22 PCBs bearing the credit and foreign exchange risk, and such other \nterms and conditions acceptable to ADB. Relending will be provided to PCBs following their \ncompetitive selection on the basis of bank soundness, and the terms and spread proposed.23 \nPCBs\u2019 subloans to farms will be provided in local currency. This mechanism will ensure that \nsubloans are extended at the interest rates sustainable for cotton farms and PCBs.  \n \n31.  Market Development. Several activities will be undertaken under the Project for grading \nand marketing regulations, establishment of a JV by the Government with an internationally \naccepted independent cotton controlling company, and bonded warehousing of cotton to follow \ninternational standards. In April 2006, the Government issued a resolution shifting from the \ncurrent Interstate Standard GOST 3279-9524 to the adoption of the universal cotton grade \nstandards (UCGS) for cotton classification, and instructing the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) to \nconduct the tendering process for the competitive selection of an international cotton grading \ncontroller.  Three  other  policy  measures  will  need  to  be  issued  to  ensure  full-scale \nimplementation  of  the  UCGS:  (i) removing  the  cotton  standardization  function  from \nTajikstandard and enabling an internationally accredited organization to grade and classify all \nseed cotton and fiber cotton produced in the country upon completion of the laboratories, (ii) \nrecognizing the new certification reports of the accredited independent inspection company by \nstate authorities such as Customs Department and TUGE, and (iii) revising the export pricing \nformula of TUGE to reflect quality differences of fiber cotton. \n \n32.  The Project will facilitate the establishment of a JV cotton grading company between the \nGovernment and an internationally accepted independent cotton controller. This JV is expected \nto undertake independent classification of all cotton in Tajikistan and apply the UCGS. It will \nalso grade seed cotton for farmers prior to its being processed into fiber cotton. The Project will \nprovide financing for the Government's equity capital contribution to the JV, renovation of three \n                                                 \n19  In addition to the line of credit, a separate proposed grant from the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) \nIncreasing Sustainable Income for Cotton Farmworkers will provide up to $2 million to microfinance institutions so \nthat they can onlend to smaller farm units in the designated raions for agricultural production and income \ndiversification. \n20  The Project will meet less than 15% of total demand for credit, which is suitable for a pilot scheme.   \n21 AgroInvest Bank, Tajiksodorot Bank, Tajprom Bank, and Eskhata Bank are the four largest privately owned banks. \nThese four banks have undergone due diligence and training for the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment\u2018s (EBRD\u2019s) small- and medium\u2013sized enterprise financing scheme, and two banks have undergone \ndue diligence for ADB\u2019s trade credit lines over the last 24 months. Bank fitness has also been confirmed with NBT \nsupervisors. These four banks qualifying for these schemes will be considered as prequalified to bid on this line of \ncredit.    \n22 The relending interest rate to the PCBs consists of the Project\u2019s loan interest rate of 1% and a 3% administration \nfee. Under the present environment, there are insurmountable barriers to creating viable banking business models \nthat will serve as alternatives to the existing credit arrangements provided by the investors. The lower than market \ninterest rate to be offered to the PCBs will enable them to (i) develop new and attractively priced financial products \nand services that address the diverse needs and widely different characteristics of the various prospective debt \nresolved farm clients, (ii) encourage institutional arrangements that will organize the debt resolved farms into \ncohesive producer groups and which can effectively link up with input suppliers and agriculture processors, and \n(iii) experiment with ways that can profitably expand credit services to these farms. A lower market interest rate for \nthe cost of money will enable PCBs to bid for the agriculture financing innovation funds with a proposed client \nspread that will cover bank administration cost of lending, cost of developing the new products, anticipated loss \nrates, and inflation; but will ensure a lending rate to farmers that is comparable to the rate charged by investors at \n18\u201320% per year.  \n23 The spread is the percentage rate per year added to the cost of the loan funds when lending to farmers. Thus, if \nfunds are borrowed by banks at 4% per annum and lent to farmers at 12% per annum, the spread is 8%. \n24 GOST  stands  for  \u201cGosudarstvenniy  Standard\u201d  (or  the  Interstate  Standard).  The  Interstate  Standard  was \nestablished in 1995 by the Interstate Council for Standardization, Metrology and Certification of which the Central \nAsian countries, including Tajikistan, are members.   \n ", "9 \nsuitable  laboratory  facilities,  and  acquisition  and  installation  of  high  volume  instrument \nequipment in the laboratories. The laboratories with equipment will be leased or leased for \npurchase to the JV, depending on the final structure of the JV contract agreement. The Project \nwill also provide legal and business management specialist assistance to conduct due diligence \nof the partner private sector company, and assist the Government to facilitate JV arrangements \nand ensure a clear understanding of its role as shareholder. \n \n33.  To expedite the export of baled cotton and maximize the value added, the Project will \nfacilitate the establishment of two bonded warehouses that meet international standards and \nthat will be operated by the private sector. Specifically, the Project will provide funds for the \nGovernment to upgrade two bonded warehousing sites to the standard required by international \npartners. Legal specialists will review the regulatory environment and propose changes needed \nto encourage the development of bonded warehouses.  \n \n34.  Common Center for Project Management. To ensure the delivery of project outputs, \nthe Common Center for Project Management (CCfPM) will be established. The Center will have \ntwo  wings:  (i)  the  policy  and  monitoring  group  to  oversee  the  policy,  communications, \nmonitoring,  and  other  activities  relating  to  cotton  farm  debt  resolution;  and  (ii)  a  project \nimplementation unit (PIU). A joint PIU under the CCfPM will be established with the World \nBank\u2019s upcoming Cotton Sector Recovery and Poverty Reduction Project. Key activities of the \nCCfPM are the timely provision and delivery of consultancy services, training requirements, and \nequipment for the Project. A project performance monitoring system (PPMS) and a gender \naction plan will be established by the CCfPM in close coordination with the Executing Agency \n(EA) and major stakeholders of the Project. It will also assist the EA in providing timely progress \nreports to the IC and ADB, as well as in the selection, identification, and tender process for the \nPCBs. \n \nC.  ADF IX Grant Component  \n \n35.  The grant component of the Project includes (i) financing for the farm debt resolution in \ndesignated raions; (ii) policy development; (iii) information, communication, and public outreach; \n(iv) capacity building in and consulting services for market development, and the agriculture \nfinancing innovations; and (v) CCfPM operations. The purposes of the grant component are to \ndevelop appropriate debt resolution mechanisms; promote competition in the cotton supply \nchain;  and  enhance  local  and  institutional  capacity  on  debt  negotiations  and  resolutions, \nbusiness planning, advocacy, and cotton grading (Appendix 5).     \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n36.  Maximizing Farmers\u2019 Returns from the Value Chain. A three-pronged approach will \nbe employed in the Project to improve farmers\u2019 returns and turn around their unprofitable farms. \n(i)  The debt issue will be addressed at the farm level by providing farmers with \nviable business plans in the selected raions and access to an alternative credit \nsource. The work in innovative agricultural financing will stimulate interest and \ncapacity in the private financial sector for farmer engagement, and create further \noptions for farmers to directly buy from private input suppliers. \n(ii)  Policy reforms will address the reason for the farmer\u2019s disincentive to produce, \nand the market distortions that make the supply chain ineffective. Numerous \noptions for farmers to increase income will be created by the requirement that the \nselected raions implement a broader range of reforms, including giving farmers \nthe fundamental right to choose production options, security of land rights from \narbitrary seizure, and release from requirements to deliver all cotton to specific \nginneries.  \n ", "10 \n(iii)  At the subsector level, the investments at the downstream level of the supply \nchain will enhance the income returns of all farmers from better quality of seed \ncotton and fiber cotton. With support from the Project, Tajikistan will shift to the \nmost widely accepted cotton grading standards system. A JV will be established \nwith controlling majority interest held by an internationally accepted independent \ncotton grading controller company. This, along with export pricing reform and \nprivate  investments  in  bonded  warehouses,  will  bring  about  higher  prices \ngenerally for Tajik fiber cotton, clarity among farmers regarding their options for \nincreasing cotton quality and prices, a better and fairer balance in the share of \nprofits between farmers and traders, and increased private sector investments in \nthe cotton subsector.  \n \nThe demonstration effects of this three-pronged approach to expanding farmers\u2019 incomes will \nreach far beyond the indebted farms in the designated raions to other farms and adjoining \ndistricts. Replication is expected to be rapid for changes that demonstrate the most far-reaching \nimprovements.   \n \n37.  Responsiveness  to  Poverty,  Gender,  and  Child  Labor  Issues.  The  Project \nrecognizes that (i) the majority of the poor depend on earnings from the cotton subsector; (ii) an \nestimated 75% of cotton farm workers are women; and (iii) child labor is employed regularly \nduring harvest season. To address these social issues, consultation processes for farm debt \nresolution in the designated raions will be undertaken before the review process and continue \nthroughout  the  debt  workout.  Social  participation  specialists  in  the  raion-based  teams  will \nensure that shareholders and workers have a clear understanding of the process and their \nrights and responsibilities. Debt resolutions (especially in development of the business plans) \nwill take into account their implications on the poor and vulnerable groups. A related grant from \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) is planned to enable special activities for poorer \nhouseholds, particularly those led by women, to diversify their income sources and access \ncredit through microfinance (footnote 19). The summary poverty reduction and social strategy is \nin Appendix 6. \n \nE.  Project Investment Plan \n \n38.  The Project is estimated to cost $15.29 million, including $0.68 million in taxes and \nduties, $1.02 million physical and price contingencies, and $0.12 million interest charges during \nimplementation.  The  project  estimates  are summarized  in  Table  1.

Financing Plan \n \n39.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan equivalent to $5.5 million and a \ngrant of $6.5 million to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per \nyear thereafter. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan  \n($ million) \n \nItem  Total   %a \nAsian Development Bank Loan  5.50  36.0 \nAsian Development Bank Grant  6.50  42.5 \nGovernment  1.75  11.4 \nPrivate Sector  1.54   10.1 \na  In the absence of the country cost sharing ceiling, cost sharing limits applicable to \nTajikistan as of 15 August 2006 apply to this Project.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n40.  The proposed grant will finance 42.5% of the total project cost. The purpose of the grant \nfinancing is to assist the Government in resolving cotton farm debt through (i) farm-by-farm \nanalysis and debt resolutions in the designated raions; (ii) capacity building and stakeholders\u2019 \nawareness training activities on the UCGS and debt workout; (iii) policy measures on and \nadvocacy  for  sustainable  debt  resolution  and  better  marketing  of  cotton;  (iv)  transparent \nselection of PCBs for the agriculture financing innovation schemes; and (v) support for the \nCCfPM.   \n \n41.  The proposed loan will finance 36.0% of the total project cost and will be applied to meet \nthe  costs  of  the  agriculture  financing  innovations,  financing  of  the  Government's  equity \ncontribution to the JV cotton classification company, upgrade of three laboratory facilities and \nessential equipment for the JV, and the upgrade of two warehouses.  \n \n42.  The Government will provide $1.75 million, or 11.4% of the total project cost, while the \nprivate sector will provide an amount of $1.54 million or 10.1%. The Government will provide the \ncosts of the project management staff seconded to the CCfPM, and in raions; facilities for \nproject operations in the raions and in Dushanbe; court support in cases of debt resolution; and \nwill waive duties and taxes on imported vehicles and equipment, in accordance with ADB \nrequirements and national legislation. The private sector\u2019s contribution will primarily be in the \nform of equity contribution of the selected internationally accepted independent cotton controller \nto the JV, investment in international standard warehouse services, and farmer and investor \ntime and work to resolve debt issues. \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n43.  The Executive Office of the President (EOP) will be the EA for the Project. The IC will \nserve as the project steering committee to provide policy guidance and reform support during \nthe farm debt resolution process, the agriculture finance innovations, and the marketing policies, \nconsistent with the action plan of the CFDRS and the road map. MOA will be the Implementing \nAgency (IA) for the JV and bonded warehouse activities, and the CCfPM will serve as the IA for \nthe farm debt resolution in designated raions and the agriculture financing innovation. The \nspecific  functions  of  these  agencies  and  the  management  organizational  chart  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n ", "12 \n44.  The Government will establish the CCfPM before 31 December 2006 to serve as the \nProject\u2019s communication link with the IC on policy matters on farm debt resolution, marketing \nissues, and other institutional concerns. The Center will be the responsibility of the EOP25 and \nwill be functionally accountable to the IC and its chairperson. A short list of candidates for the \nCenter director will be competitively determined. From this list, the Government will select the \nmost suitable to be the Center director, to be endorsed by ADB. The Project will fund the \nsalaries of staff and some operational costs of the Center.  \n \n45.  The financial management assessment (Supplementary Appendix H) of potential EAs for \nthe  Project  (EOP,  NBT,  and  MOA)  concluded  that  the  EAs  examined  do  not  have  direct \nexperience in project implementation. In addition, they have accounting weaknesses and are \nnot technically equipped to administer project funds. Therefore, a project implementation unit \n(PIU) will be established for the Project and will be under the CCfPM. In order to encourage \ndonor harmonization, sustainability, and cost saving, the Project\u2019s PIU will be established jointly \nwith the World Bank\u2019s anticipated Cotton Sector Recovery and Poverty Reduction Project.  \n \n2.  Agricultural Financing Innovation Bank Selection and Monitoring \n \n46.  Four PCBs have undergone detailed financial and management reviews under the ADB \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department  Trade  Facility  and  under  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development\u2019s  (EBRD\u2019s)  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  lending \nprogram. These PCBs continue to qualify for access to either of these two facilities and meet \nNBT supervision requirements, and they may apply for funding under the agriculture finance \ninnovation  component  of  the  Project.  Interested  PCBs  may  submit  tender  proposals  for  a \nsubloan to be used to lend to debt-restructured farms in the designated raions. Tendering will be \nin a format suitable to the IC and ADB.  \n \n47.  The proposals from the PCBs will be submitted to the CCfPM and banking consultant for \nevaluation and recommendation, with final approval from the IC and ADB. Up to three proposals \nare expected to be selected based on (i) feasibility and product creativity, potential client impact, \nplanned spread, and potential for sustainable product expansion beyond the project area; and \n(ii) percentage of PCB's own contribution to the expansion plan. The subloan size to each \nselected  bank  is  limited  to  20%  of  equity,  substantiated  by  the  bank\u2019s  annual  audited \nstatements. Once selected, the PCBs will sign SLAs with the Government in a form acceptable \nto ADB. The PCBs will be regularly monitored by the CCfPM for their compliance of the criteria.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n48.  The Project will be implemented over a three-year period from March 2007 and is \nexpected to be completed in March 2010. The closing date for withdrawals from loan grant \naccounts is September 2010. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 8, and the \ndetailed schedule is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n49.  Goods, related services, and civil works will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Civil works valued less than $1 million and procurement of vehicles \n                                                 \n25 The IC (an interministerial body) and the economic adviser of the EOP (who serves as chair of the IC) do not have \nthe technical support and capacity to assess, monitor, and prepare appropriate policy measures for effective \nimplementation of the CFDRS, its action plan, and the road map. Donor support for policy and institutional reforms \ndoes not have the proper channel of supporting the IC with its technical requirements. To fill the gap, the \nGovernment will establish the CCfPM for the IC. The Center, like the IC, will be a temporary unit that will be \ndissolved once the IC has put in place sustainable solutions for the resolution of cotton farm debt.  \n ", "13 \nmay be procured through limited international bidding (LIB). Procurement of computers, printers, \nand  other  office  equipment  as  well  as  printed  materials,  radio,  television  and  newspaper \ncontracts for the outreach activities will follow the LIB and shopping procedures. The EA will \ncertify to ADB that the goods and services financed by the loan and grant are procured from \nterritories of Asian Development Fund (ADF) contributors and donor member countries of ADB. \nADB must approve in advance the awarding of all contracts and substantial contract variations. \nThe procurement plan is in Appendix 9.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  The Project will provide 62 allocated person-months of international consultants and \n1,207 allocated person-months of national consultants for the following areas: (i) conduct of the \nfarm-by-farm analysis and farm debt resolution in the designated raions; (ii) training of key \nagencies and stakeholders in the cotton subsector in the application of UCGS and business \nplan development; (iii) dissemination of technologies that ensure accurate quality valuation of \nseed cotton and fiber cotton as well as other relevant policies; (iv) facilitation of the tender \nprocess and rehabilitation of facilities for bonded warehouses; (v) facilitation of legal structures \nand due diligence for the JV and bonded warehousing; (vi) public information flows on farm debt \nresolution activities and processes as well as cotton grading and marketing improvements; \n(vii) policy formulation for IC consideration on issues related to the CFDRS; and (viii) project \nmanagement services and an effective communication link with the IC. Unallocated person-\nmonths  equivalent  to  24  person-months  of  national  consultants  and  6  person-months  of \ninternational  consultants  will  be  used  to  finance  consulting  services  for  policy  and  market \ndevelopment issues on cotton subsector development to be identified in the road map (Appendix \n10, paras 14 and 34). These issues will be identified during project implementation. The outline \nterms of reference (TORs) for consulting services are in Appendix 10. Detailed TORs are in \nSupplementary Appendix N. \n \n51.  The consulting services for farm debt resolution will be provided by an international firm, \nin association with national consultants or a national consulting firm. These will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using full technical proposals and \nquality-based selection (QBS). The QBS method will be used to ensure the selection of a good \nmix of highly qualified consultants with a track record on farm debt mediations and development \nof farm recovery plans. It is important that the consultants be selected on the basis of their \ntechnical merit and extensive work experience in resolving farm debt because the Government \nputs high priority on the expedient resolution of this problem through subsector-wide replication \nof  the  protocols  and  procedures  to  be  developed  under  the  Project.  Moreover,  farm  debt \nresolution has a significant downstream impact not just at the subsector level but also at the \nagriculture sector in general. The international firm to be selected for implementation of the farm \ndebt resolution component will be engaged for three years subject to an annual performance \nreview before each year commences. An assessment of the international firm\u2019s performance will \nbe done jointly by the EA and ADB in a timely manner to enable extension of services to the \nfollowing year.  \n \n52.  Quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) will be used for cotton market development, \nand awareness training for UCGS and bonded warehouses. Modified (simplified) QCBS will be \nused for the engagement of NGOs to conduct awareness training and development of PPMS \nand the gender action plan. Individual selection will be used for the identification of director for \nthe CCfPM, while least-cost selection will be applied for the auditing firm for the external audit \nservice. Biodata technical proposals will be used for these consulting selection methods.  \n \n ", "14 \n6.  Anticorruption  \n \n53.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998) was explained to and discussed with the EOP and \nMOA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, \nADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt, \nfraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. Relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan and grant regulations and in bidding documents for \nthe Project. All contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and IAs as \nwell as all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the \nProject. \n \n54.  In  relation  to  the  Project,  the  Government  will  ensure  disclosure  of  project-related \nprocurement  actions  in  local  newspapers  and  the  internet.  Such  disclosed  information  will \ninclude, among other matters, the list of participating bidders, the winning bidder, reference to \nthe  tender  procedures  adopted,  amount  of  the  contract  awarded,  and  general  terms  and \nspecifications of goods, works, and services procured. In addition, the IC will hold regular \nbriefings with the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to share data on any corrupt practices detected related to \nproject activities.  \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n55.  The proceeds of the ADB loan and grant will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  of  January  2001,  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  For  consulting \nservices, civil works, and equipment and vehicle purchase following LIB procedures, loan and \ngrant funds will be disbursed directly. For computers, printers and related goods, as well as \nprinted,  radio,  TV  and  newspaper  contracts  following  LIB/shopping  procedure,  and  small \nexpenditures related to the CCfPM, reimbursement and imprest fund procedures will be applied. \nThe CCfPM will open two imprest accounts, one for the loan funds and the other for the grant \nfunds, in a domestic bank satisfactory to ADB. The initial deposit to the imprest account will be \n$250,000 for the loan proceeds and $300,000 for the grant proceeds, but will not exceed the \nestimated  expenditures  for  6  months  of  project  implementation.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of \nexpenditures procedure will be applied to reimburse expenditures and to liquidate and replenish \nthe imprest account for payments of $50,000 and below. Direct payment will be made to PCBs \nwith SLAs under the agriculture financing innovation and for drawdowns for the Government\u2019s \nequity contribution to the JV and purchases of equipment over $50,000. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n56.  Project accounts acceptable to ADB will be maintained by the EA, through the CCfPM, in \naccordance with the provisions of the financing agreement and ADB\u2019s Financial Management \nand  Analysis  Projects.26 The  EA,  through  the  CCfPM,  will  maintain  separate  records  and \naccounts for goods, works, and services to be financed out of the loan or grant proceeds and \ngovernment financing following sound accounting principles. Auditors acceptable to ADB will \naudit the accounts and records annually. Within six months of the close of the financial year, \ncertified  copies  of  the  audit  report  in  English,  together  with  the  auditor\u2019s  opinion,  will  be \nsubmitted to the Government and ADB. The audit reports will include a management letter and \na separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedure. \nThe Government has been advised that delays in the submission of audited financial statements \nmay result in the suspension of loan and grant disbursements by ADB.   \n \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis Projects. Manila. \n ", "15 \n57.  A  periodic  external  auditor  will  be  employed  using  grant  project  funds  to  conduct \nunannounced checks on cash, bank accounts, and other related records for the Project at least \none to two days per month. Periodic spot checks on national consultants will also be undertaken \nto ensure that employment is consistent with ADB and government guidelines. This auditor will \nbe accountable to the IC chairperson and will report findings and recommendations to the \nchairperson, the CCfPM director, and ADB.  \n \n58.  The PCBs will be required to maintain separate accounts for the funds spent under the \nProject.  The  PCBs\u2019  annual  accounts  and  project  accounts,  provided  in  accordance  with \ninternational  financial  reporting  standards,  will  be  audited  by  auditors  acceptable  to  ADB. \nCopies in English of the accounts and audit reports, together with the auditor\u2019s opinion and \nmanagement letter, will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the completion of each financial \nyear.  \n \n59.  The EA and IAs, with the assistance of the CCfPM will submit quarterly and annual \nreports to ADB. The reports will indicate progress made, problems encountered, steps taken to \nremedy  the  problems,  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the  remaining \nimplementation period, as well as project performance data. The reporting system will focus on \noutcomes, efficiency, profitability, and quality consistent with the project framework. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n60.  To monitor the progress of the Project in achieving the outcome and outputs, the CCfPM \nwill establish and maintain a PPMS within three months of commencement of project activities. \nDuring project inception, a matrix of sub-indicators will be developed in a participatory manner \nthat substantiates the performance indicators as shown in Appendix 1. Baseline data will be \ngathered for the indicators and will be updated on a semiannual basis. This data will be reported \nto other donors, interested stakeholders, and the public. \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n61.  At least three field missions per year will be undertaken to (i) sustain the meetings with \nthe President of Tajikistan and high-level government officials on farm debt resolution; (ii) \nassess advocacy work through communication and information dissemination; and (ii) ensure a \nquick response to emerging situations. Close coordination with the resident mission will ensure \ntechnical support for effective participation and representation of ADB. The EA and ADB will \nreview the implementation of the Project semiannually, using information gathered from the \nPPMS  and  progress  reports  on  project  activities.  The  EA  and  ADB  will  carry  out  joint \nperformance reviews after 1.5 years and at project completion.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n62.  A political economy framework, combined with a value chain and benefit-cost analysis, \nwas used in (i) assessing the economic and social rationale for the set of measures; and \n(ii) evaluating the net benefits and impact of the Project. Under a distorted market situation, as \nin the case of Tajikistan\u2019s cotton subsector\u2019s value chain, the economic returns accruing to the \nparticipants in the value chain are not maximized. Leakages through rent-extractive means \narise, and the economic returns are unequally distributed among the players. These result in \neconomic losses to the subsector and the national economy in general. Appendix 11 discusses \nthe  financial  and  economic  analysis  in  detail,  while  the  comprehensive  assessment  is  in \nSupplementary Appendix J. \n \n ", "16 \nA.  Project Benefits  \n \n63.  Benefits resulting from farm-by-farm analysis and debt resolution will include financially \nviable farms in the participating raions. These farms will have substantially reduced their debt \nand will have a net income that enables payment for all short-term operating requirements as \nwell as repayment of restructured debt. Benefits from the agricultural financing innovation in \ndesignated raions include (i) more rapid farm implementation of post-restructuring business \noptions,  (ii)  restoration  of  creditor  confidence  in  those  farms,  and  (iii)  facilitation  of  more \ninnovative and client-responsive commercial bank services to the general farming community.   \n \n64.  Removing market distortions, and improving the efficiency of processing seed cotton and \nmarketing fiber cotton, have been estimated to increase the farm gate price for seed cotton by \n$354 per ton (t). This amounts to a 49.0% increase in farm gate returns. On the basis of \n448,000 t of seed cotton produced in 2005, total farm income increases by $52 million per \nannum.27 In the four designated raions, the improved economic returns for seed cotton together \nwith changes to the cropping pattern and the forecast increase in cotton yield from 1.8 t/ha to \n2.4 t/ha gives an economic internal rate of return of 28.7%. \n \n65.  Under a \u201cwithout project\u201d scenario, the farmers' share of total margin in the marketing \nand distribution system is relatively small, with only 52.0% of the total value of fiber cotton and \n65.0% of the value derived from the sale of cotton by-products. With the Project, this total \nmargin is estimated to improve to 67.0% of the value from fiber cotton and 75.0% from the value \nof cotton by-products accruing to farmers.  \n \n66.  Increased government revenues through higher cotton tax collection as well as reduction \nin resource wastage due to market distortions will mean more funds available for the provision \nof public goods. Estimates of additional government revenues are about $2.3 million per annum. \n  \n67.  There are social benefits to improved returns for poor farmers (Appendix 6).  In a World \nBank study, it was estimated that a 10.0% increase in cotton yield would result in a 1.5% \ndecrease in poverty incidence. These computations were conducted for the \u201cwithout project\u201d \nscenario. The conservative estimate on poverty reduction is 3.0%, but it may go as high as 7.0\u2013\n10.0% at the end of the Project. As women farmers comprise a large shareholding in cotton \nfarms, the Project will benefit women. Combined with a public outreach that disseminates the \nsuccess stories, the results will have multiplier effects.  \n \n68.  With changes in crop financing, farm workers\u2019 wages will be paid in cash and not in kind \n(cotton stems and limited cottonseed oil). This will be a boost to the impoverished farm workers, \nmostly women and children.  \n \n69.  The use of child labor during cotton harvesting will diminish in the medium term with \nimproved  incomes.  In  the  short  term,  business  plans  of  restructured  indebted  farms  will \nincorporate measures that will discourage the employment of child labor. Mitigation measures \nwill also be put in place in situations where farms declare bankruptcy.    \n \n70.  Reduction of market distortions, combined with a public outreach program, will enhance \nthe bargaining leverage of poor farmers and vulnerable groups in the subsector. The Project will \nshowcase the economic and social benefits of reduced market distortions and more transparent \nand accountable governance among players in the subsector.  \n \n                                                 \n27 This ignores any allowance for changes in the cropping pattern or for increased yields, which would eventually be \nexpected in a less regulated environment and with the incentive of improved farm gate prices.   \n ", "17 \n71.  There  are no  perceived  environmental  costs  arising  from  the  Project  but  mitigation \nmeasures are nevertheless proposed in the business plans for the debt-restructured farms to \nensure that the use of harmful pesticides and chemicals will not intensify (Appendix 12 and \nSupplementary Appendix K). \n \nB.  Project Sustainability \n \n72.  In conjunction with the financial management assessment of the proposed EA, a review \nwas conducted to determine the financial viability of those aspects of the Project with ongoing \nrecurrent cost implications. The main project measures to which this applies is the upgrade of \nthree laboratories for the JV, adoption of the UCGS, and the use of two bonded warehouses. \nRevenues  generated  from  fees  charged  for  the  service  of  ensuring  accurate  cotton \nclassifications and the lease option for the warehouses will be more than adequate to finance \nthe operation and maintenance of the laboratory and the bonded warehouses on a sustainable \nbasis. \n \n73.  To ensure sustainable resolution of farm debt and development of the cotton subsector, \nthe Government has formulated a comprehensive CFDRS that defines the short- and medium-\nterm policy and institutional reforms. An action plan for the strategy has been developed by the \nGovernment  in  close  consultation  with  the  donor  community.  A  road  map  is  also  being \ndeveloped, jointly by the Government and the international community, which will prioritize and \nsequence the policy measures for the cotton subsector\u2019s turnaround. The action plan and the \nroad map are being monitored and are periodically discussed by the donor community with the \nIC to ensure effective attainment of the expected outcomes. Continued support from the donor \ncommunity for the implementation of the medium-term measures under the CFDRS and the \nroad map will be maintained through the support of ADB and World Bank resident missions, \nwhich have representations in the IC.   \n  \nC.  Project Risks \n \n74.  The main risks relating to the Project are from stakeholders who have political and \neconomic power and who may incur losses in the short term from the reform and investment \nmeasures.  These  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  a  combination  of  direct  ongoing  quarterly \nconsultations with the President of Tajikistan and a proactive communication program to ease \nresistance and  build  strategic  alliances,  information  dissemination,  education, and  capacity \nbuilding. This will include dissemination of early success stories in the farm debt resolution \nexercise. The IC will play a critical role in ensuring the full cooperation of investors and rais. The \nPresident  has  spearheaded  reforms  by  instructing  key  ministries  to  help  ensure  investor \nparticipation in the debt audit exercise. Continued support and involvement of the President in \ndebt resolution will be maintained during project implementation.  \n \n75.  The significant risk relating to the attainment of the outcome is that the rais continue to \nimplement  the  one-ginnery  and  one-investor  per  district  policy  and  retain  the  authority  to \nconfiscate land use rights. Government assurances have been provided at the highest level to \nensure that local governments cooperate with the debt resolution process in the designated \nraions. Additionally, policy activities include assessment of the issue of tax options that can \nenhance the rais\u2019 developmental roles in local governance.28  \n \n76.  The major assumption of the Project is that the Government, through its IC, will upscale \nat a subsector-wide level the debt resolution protocols and procedures developed in the four \n                                                 \n28 Bilateral organizations such as the Finland fund have expressed their interest to provide technical support for the \nconduct of these policy studies and for their implementation.   \n ", "18 \nraions and implement the medium-term policy and institutional reforms of the CFDRS. These \nserve  as  the  basis  for  full  economic  recovery  of  the  cotton  subsector  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of this subsector and the agriculture sector. The donor community has joined \nforces  in  monitoring  the  CFDRS  and  providing  additional  support  to  the  Government  to \ncomplement its medium-term commitments in this regard.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n77.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Cotton  farm  debt  resolution  strategy  and  road  map.  Throughout  project \nimplementation,  the  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Cotton  Farm  Debt \nResolution Strategy in the Republic of Tajikistan of 4 March 2005 and the Action \nPlan  of  the  Independent  Commission  of  12  September  2005  are  fully \nimplemented and strictly complied with by all relevant government agencies, and \nwill ensure, including by means of issuing relevant acts and resolutions, that such \nagencies provide full support to and facilitate in the implementation of the Project. \n \n(ii)  Freedom  to  farm.  Within  one  year  of  effectiveness,  the  Government  will \nundertake  all  necessary  measures  satisfactory  to  ADB  to  ensure  successful \ncotton  farm  debt  resolution  in  the  designated  raions,  including  adoption  of \nadequate  and  effective  implementing  legislation  that  removes  restrictions  to \ndecision making.  \n \n(iii)  Secure and alienable land use rights. Within nine months of effectiveness, the \nGovernment will undertake all necessary measures to ensure that farmers\u2019 land \nuse rights in the designated raions are freely transferable, inheritable, and secure \nfrom outright revocation, cancellation or surrender without advance notice and \nrecourse  to  legal  and  transparent  process  (with  insolvency  or  bankruptcy \nprocedures not being a ground for revocation, cancellation and surrender of such \nland use rights), and that such  rights can be used as collateral for loans. \n \n(iv)  Provision of warehouses and laboratories. The Government will ensure that \nwarehouses and laboratories to be rehabilitated and upgraded under the Project \nare  free  and  clear  of  any  encumbrances,  including  tenants  and  informal \noccupants, have unrestricted access to railways, and are acceptable to ADB. \n \n(v)  Special customs regime of bonded warehouses. The Government will ensure \nthat within 18 months of effectiveness, the warehouses rehabilitated under the \nProject have obtained the full status and operability of \u201ccustoms warehouses\u201d or \na similar customs regime acceptable to ADB. \n \n(vi)  Operation and maintenance of bonded warehouses. The Government will \nensure that within two years of effectiveness, the operation and maintenance of \nthe  warehouses  rehabilitated  under  the  Project  have  been  transferred  to  an \ninternationally  recognized  warehouse  operator  company,  selected  in  lawful, \ncompetitive,  and  transparent  tender  procedures  and  otherwise  acceptable  to \nADB.   \n \n ", "19 \n(vii)  Cotton grading JV. Within eight months of effectiveness, the Government, in \npartnership  with  an  internationally  accepted  independent  cotton  controller, \nselected  in  a  lawful,  competitive  and  transparent  manner  and  otherwise \nacceptable to ADB, will have established the JV fully authorized, registered and \nlicensed to conduct independent cotton grading under the UCGS without undue \ninterference of any government agency.   \n \n(viii)  Universal cotton grade standards. By September 2007, the Government will \nensure implementation of the UCGS. \n \n(ix)  Project financing. In the event of any shortfall or disruption in the financing of \nthe Project caused by, for example, the delay or inadequacy of funding of the \nProject, the Government will promptly provide adequate funds for successful \nimplementation of the Project.   \n \n(x)  Change of ownership or operation. In the event of any change in ownership of \nthe  project  facilities,  the  JV  or  the  customs  warehouses,  or  lease  or  other \nmodification of the Government\u2019s  functions and authority over operation and \nmaintenance of the project facilities, the Government will consult with, and obtain \nthe consent of, ADB at least six months prior to the implementation of such \nchange. The Government will ensure that such change is carried out in a lawful \nand transparent manner.  \n \n(xi)  Continuity of IC. The Government will ensure that the IC continues to implement \nthe CFDRS and that its functions and authorities are not repealed, suspended or \ncancelled until completion of the project. \n \n(xii)  Selection  of  PCBs.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  each  PCB  has  been \nselected in a transparent and competitive manner satisfying the criteria agreed \nwith  ADB  and  is  in  continuing  compliance  with  such  criteria  so  long  as  it \nparticipates in the Project.  It will also ensure that the farms selected for financing \nunder the Agriculture Financing Innovation Component abstain from child labor.   \n \n(xiii)  Access  and  provision  of  data.  The  Government  will  cause  NBT,  MOA, \nKreditInvest, and TUGE to provide ADB staff and consultants unrestricted, within \nworking  regime,  access  to  the  cotton  farm  debt  databases  and  supporting \ndocumentation on a confidential and ongoing basis, and to facilitate setup of a \nunified database for purposes of monitoring and accurately reflecting the debt of \nfarms in the country. \n \n(xiv)  Transparency of judicial process. The Government will ensure that judicial \nproceedings on the cotton farm debt resolution are carried out promptly and in a \nlawful and transparent manner, with the process being open to the public and \nmedia  and  relevant  court  decisions  being  promptly  published  in  Tajik  and \nRussian.  \n \n(xv)  Gender and development. The Government will ensure that a Gender Action \nPlan (GAP) focusing on women\u2019s representation in decision-making processes, \nneeds  in  the  decision  and  operation  of  the  Project  outputs,  participation  in \ntraining, and involvement in Project monitoring and evaluation and acceptable to \nADB is carried out during Project implementation, and that adequate resources \nare allocated for this purpose.  \n \n ", "20 \nB.  Conditions for Disbursement \n \n78.  Any disbursement from the loan or grant account shall be subject to the Government \nissuing a resolution, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, regarding the formation of the \nCCfPM. \n  \n79.  Disbursement of any portion of the loan proceeds to any PCB for the Project shall be \nsubject to receipt by ADB of the Government\u2019s certification, in form and substance satisfactory \nto ADB, that the SLA with such PCB includes the terms and conditions consistent with those \nunder the Financing Agreement, has been duly executed by and delivered on behalf of the \nGovernment and the concerned PCB and has become fully effective and binding upon the \nparties thereto in accordance with its terms. \n \n80.

In the last five years, the cotton industry\u2019s yields and profitability have continued to \ndecline. Market distortions, government interventions in the strategic aspects of the cotton\u2019s \nsupply chain, huge farm debt, and weaknesses in production have severely damaged the \nprofitability of the cotton subsector. \n \nA.  Agriculture Sector Context \n \n2.  In 2004, the agriculture sector generated 22% of gross domestic product (GDP), 20% of \nexports, 67% of employment, and 39% of tax revenues. The sector has accounted for one third \nof Tajikistan\u2019s economic growth since 1998, with crop production contributing about 80% of the \nsector\u2019s growth from 1999 to 2004.1 The main crops are wheat (38% of the total crop output); \ncotton (30%); fodder crops (12%); potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and industrial crops (12%); and \nother cereals (8%).  \n \n3.  Much of the crop expansion in the post-civil war period (post-1997) were the result of \nchanges in land use\u2014specifically significant decreases in the area devoted to fodder crops and \nincreases in land cultivating wheat and other food crops. Areas allocated for cotton production \ndeclined initially but have since recovered almost to the pre-independence level. Arable land in \nthe country is extremely scarce (roughly 0.21 hectare [ha] per capita of the rural population) and \nirrigated land is very limited (just 60% of arable land). While expanded food production has \nhelped reduce food poverty, future agriculture growth may be hampered  because of the low \nvalue share of food crops, and because of environmental concerns, since low-income rural \nhouseholds (which have least access to land) would increasingly utilize marginal lands. Most of \nthe limited irrigated land is reserved for cotton and wheat production, where there are less \nrestorative crop rotations. Coupled with poor drainage and inefficient irrigation facilities, this has \nled to degradation of the soil quality.  \n \n4.  All land is owned by the state, but lifelong, inheritable land use certificates for dekhan \n(peasant) farms are increasingly issued. These certificates cannot be transferred or mortgaged. \nHistorically, farming was done by large state farms called sofkhozes or kholkhozes. In 2001, \nthere  were  687  such  farms.  Under  an  accelerated  privatization  program,  most  have  been \nbroken up into smaller units. At the end of 2005, about 27,000 dehkan farms were registered \nand provided with land use rights certificates.2 These farms cover more than half of the total \nirrigated land and are planted mainly with cotton and wheat. In 2003, dekhan farms contributed \n20% of agriculture output and 37% of the sector\u2019s growth. The other farm type is the household \nplot (0.1\u20130.3 ha) which are provided to all households for food production purposes. Although \nthe aggregate area of household plots was only 17.2% of total arable hectares and only 13.9% \nof irrigated land in 2003, their contribution to gross agricultural output was 53.6% of the total, \nand 50.8% of the sector\u2019s growth. The major difference between these two farm types is the \nextent of freedom to make farm decisions. Unlike dekhan farmers, who are bound by local \ngovernments to cultivate cotton in 70% of their land and meet the allotted production target for \nseed cotton (or they lose their land use rights), household plot producers are free from state \ninterference.  \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2006. Priorities for Sustainable Growth: A Strategy for Agriculture Sector Development in Tajikistan. \nWashington, DC: World Bank.  \n2  Dekhan farms are privately run smaller-sized farms averaging 170 ha per farm, created from state and collective \nfarms. These farms are organized either as a collective, or are individual or family-based. The new farm owners \nhave inheritable land use rights.    \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n5.  The trade base of agriculture is narrow: cotton provides 75\u201390% of export values, and \nfresh and processed fruits and vegetables provide the bulk of the remainder. Export receipts \nfrom  cotton  are  vulnerable  to  world  price  volatility,  while  export  revenues  from  fruits  and \nvegetables are vulnerable to the Russian market, which absorbs 95% of this trade. Both export \ncrops are susceptible to the vagaries of regional politics, especially since the rail links through \nUzbekistan  carry  95%  of  exports.  Tajikistan  imports  virtually  all  its  fertilizer,  agricultural \nchemicals, and fuel from neighboring countries, making inputs relatively cheaper than direct \npurchase from producer countries further away, although there are the attendant risks of poorer \nquality and unreliable deliveries.   \n \n6.  The sector\u2019s high growth rate was a major factor in the decline in rural poverty incidence \n(at a poverty line of $2.15/day purchasing power parity) from 82% in 1999 to 65% in 2004. \nHowever, sustained poverty reduction will require the sector to grow by at least at 6\u20137% per \nannum. This would mean an investment of $100 million-$130 million per year in irrigation, \nmachinery,  processing  of  cotton  and  other  products,  and  other  requirements. 3  Current \ninvestment is only about half that level. Seasonal financing requirements are about $90 million\u2013\n$100 million, of which 80% goes to cotton production. Current lending to the agriculture sector \nfrom formal financial institutions is low; formal sector lending in the 2005\u20132006 season was \nestimated at about half the requirement. Growth in crop production, which was buoyed by low \nvalue food and cereal crops, will have to rely on a high valued and diversified crop mix.  \n \n7.  The most important policy recommendations that will enhance producer incentives and \nspur investments in the sector are: (i) farmers are given the freedom to choose what to grow, \nhow to grow and market their produce, and when and to whom they can sell their produce; \n(ii) farmers must have secured land use rights; and (iii) commodity and factor markets are free \nfrom  government  interference.  The  other  priority  agenda  for  moving  the  agriculture  sector \nforward is to address the poor performance of the cotton subsector.  \n \nB.  The Cotton Subsector \n \n8.  Production Situation. Cotton continues to dominate rural life and provide significant \nexport income in Tajikistan. Cotton is grown on 50% of the country\u2019s irrigated farmland. In 2004, \nthe cotton subsector provided 60% of the value of total agriculture output, 75% of agriculture \ntrade, 18% of total export receipts, and about 35% of tax revenues. Cotton incomes supported \n75% of farm households, and 75% of Tajikistan\u2019s poor and extremely poor households. Data on \noutput and yield in Table A2 demonstrate the decline in profitability. The decline in yields is due \nto a variety of economic and production factors discussed below.  \n \nTable A2: Tajikistan Cotton Outputs and Yields, Selected Years 1991\u20132004 \n \n  Output (ton)    Yields (ton/ha) \nRegions  1991  1999  2001  2003  2004    1991  1999  2001  2003  2004 \nTajikistan  825.145  313.125  452,735  537,358  556,991    2.8  1.3  1.8  1.9  1.9 \nSughd  237,504  115,107  145,347  148,466  159,424    2.7  1.6  1.9  1.7  1.8 \nKhatlon  534,015  171,658  255,092  334,063  334,410    2.8  1.1  1.6  1.9  1.9 \nRRS  50,626  26,360  52,296  54,829  63,157    2.4  1.3  2.4  2.2  2.4 \n \nha \u2013 hectare; RRS \u2013 Regions of Republican Subordination  \nSource: Central Statistics Office, Tajikistan. \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001. Agricultural Sector Assessment Report for Tajikistan (Revised Final Report. ULG Northumbrian Ltd,). \nManila. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n9.  Cotton production is concentrated in the northern Sughd and southern Khatlon oblasts \n(regions), and the latter produces 60% of the total crop. Cotton production costs $380/ha-\n$580/ha. In around 15% of the cases, farmers self-finance or borrow from banks or other \ninstitutions. The majority of farmers borrow from local traders, called investors.  \n \n10.  The  investors  supply  inputs  in-kind  during  the  planting  periods  of  March/April  and \nthrough the cultivation period until hand harvesting occurs in September/October. In return, the \nfarmers deliver their raw cotton to a predetermined gin for processing, and repay the local \ninvestor for the loan by providing an agreed amount of raw cotton.   \n \n11.  Issues. The cotton subsector is currently underperforming. At the farm level, average \nyield in 2005/06 is low at 1.55 tons per ha (tph), down from 2.80 tph in 1991. Current seasonal \nyield is 1.25 tph short of the estimated yield level required to ensure that cotton farms earn \nreasonable profits. Labor productivity has also fallen. It takes 250\u2013350 person-hours to produce \n1 ton of seed cotton\u2014more than four times the international competitive level of 70\u201380 person-\nhours.4 Reversing these trends is critical to the success of cotton production in the country. \n \n12.  Unprofitable cotton farms are inextricably linked to poverty. While the recent positive \ngrowth  rates  experienced  by  Tajikistan  have  resulted  in  reduced  poverty  incidence,  the \nproportion of poor rural households remains highest in Sughd and Khatlon. About 72% of all the \npoor in the country and 75% of the extreme poor live in these two regions. Enhancing cotton \nfarm profitability is thus a priority agenda for alleviating rural income poverty in Tajikistan. \n \n13.  The key performance issues and areas that must be addressed to improve Tajikistan\u2019s \ncotton subsector production and profitability are numerous and interlinked. In the medium term, \nthese include sector-wide investment and policy reforms, such as (i) irrigation and market \ninfrastructure development, (ii) extension services, (iii) development of market-based seed and \nother inputs industries, (iv) gin rehabilitation, and (v) policies promoting crop diversification. In \nthe immediate term, the most critical issues that need urgent response are the debt overhang, \nlack of financing for cotton, and the monopolistic and rent-seeking behavior that one-sided \nproduction financing arrangements have engendered. Improvement in the cotton marketing \npractices in the grading system and mechanisms, and the pricing formula can provide quick \nreprieve to an ailing cotton subsector. The areas that need immediate attention are as follows. \n \n14.  Hukumat (District Government) and Cotton Production Forecasting. The system of \ncentral planning for cotton has nominally been replaced in the post-Soviet period. Each year, \nthe Government develops national and raion (district) production forecasts. Chairpersons of \nlocal governments (appointed directly by the President of Tajikistan) are held accountable for \nmeeting the forecasts in their jurisdiction, and have been known to lose their positions if they fail \nto meet these targets. Additionally, the tax system provides for up-front tax revenues from \ncotton, and these collections help the rais (district governor) make their critical tax revenue \ntargets. All of these factors provide powerful incentives for local governments to collude with \ninvestors and require farmers to produce the maximum amount of cotton area using minimum \ninputs, and to keep all sales and ginning in the local raion. Local governments also have the \ncapacity to revoke farmers\u2019 land use certificates under broad, vaguely defined conditions of \n\u201cirrational land use,\u201d thus providing them with considerable power over farmers. \n   \n15.  Debt Overhang. Defaulted cotton farm debt arising from the lopsided input financing \nmechanism between the investor and the farm has accumulated since 1998 at a significant rate. \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2004. Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms. Manila, p. 74. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nTotal outstanding cotton production debt carryover from previous years\u2019 loans was estimated by \nthe National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) at $292.8 million in 2006\u2014equivalent to over three full \nseasons of financing and roughly equal to the government operations budget for a year. Debt \nper ha ranges from less than $500 to over $8,000. About 9% of indebted farms, covering 15% of \nthe total cotton area, have debt of over $1,500 per ha.  \n \n16.  Lenders have not responded to the usual market signals of non-repayment by slowing \ndown cotton-farm lending, and there have been no efforts by lenders or borrowers to consider \nfarms\u2019 capacity to repay on a sustainable basis. Investor practices exacerbating farm debt \nrollover include oversupply; over-invoicing and overpricing of inputs supplied; inadequate timing \nand quality of inputs; locking in farmers by placing liens from prior debts on current cotton \nproduction; and constant rollover of unpaid debts and annual capitalization of unpaid interest \nplus penalties. Lack of accountability of farm association managers and accountants to farm \nowners and members for farm financial arrangements has also aggravated the problem. Lastly, \nthere was lack of NBT supervision over KreditInvest, the nonfinancial institution that provided \ncredit sources to the majority of investors.  \n \n17.  Failure to penalize lenders for this malpractice was due in part to the local governments\u2019 \nneed for investors to provide input financing for cotton production\u2014the income source of their \ntax quota allotment, which if met, is the basis for their political survival. The hukumats thus \nrequire farmers not only to plant cotton on 70% of their farmland but to (i) obtain their crop \nfinancing needs only from the district-designated investor, and (ii) process their produce in the \ndistrict-designated gin. The one-investor policy of the hukumats ensures lopsided conditions on \nthe production contract arrangements in favor of the local investor.  \n \n18.  External factors also contributed to the accumulation of debt, among them the decline in \nthe world prices for fiber cotton and the increase in the prices of vital inputs used by the \nsubsector, such as fuel, fertilizer, and minerals. Because of the heavy debt levels and related \nmarket restrictions, lending to the agricultural sector through financial institutions is effectively \nfrozen.  Alternative  financing  support  from  international  financial  organizations  and  external \nprivate sector will not be possible unless cotton farm debt is resolved in a transparent and \nvoluntary manner between creditors and farmers.  \n \n19.  There are currently no viable alternatives to investor credit for the cotton subsector in \nTajikistan. The banking sector in the country is extremely small, with a loan to GDP ratio of just \n4.5% and a deposit to GDP ratio of 4.0%. Most of its credit resources go to industry (40%) and \ncommerce (40%), with only 10% going to agriculture. Formal financial institutions are highly \ncautious in lending to agriculture ventures because of the high transaction costs entailed in \nproviding credit to farmer clients, the lack of farm assets for collateral, the moral hazard, and the \nrisky environment and uncertainty of agriculture production.        \n \n20.  Farm Restructuring in Tandem with Farm Debt Allocation. The farm restructuring \nprocess has resulted in an increase of cotton farms, from 658 farms at year-end 2002 to over \n22,000 farms in late 2005. There has been no systemic attention given to farm management \nneeds, or to the reassignment or assumption of public or private farm debt obligations. Under a \nPresidential  Decree,  private  debt  was  reassigned  on  a  per-irrigated  hectare  basis  after \nconsideration  of  machinery  and  other  non-land  asset  distribution.  As  of  1  October  2005, \napproximately 61% of restructured farms have signed debt reallocation agreements, and the \nprocess is ongoing. However, the debt reallocation process was undertaken without reviewing \nthe accuracy of debt and reference to the new farm\u2019s capacity to repay the assigned debt. This \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nwill undoubtedly complicate investor capacity to engage with and manage farm debtors, and will \nsignificantly increase the size and complexity of farm debt resolution.   \n \n21.  Cotton Processing and Marketing. The systems in Tajikistan for the collection of seed \ncotton  and  its  processing  are  weak,  and  involve  monopolistic  market  arrangements  and \ninterventionist  policies.  The  most  important  impediments  are  the  poor  cotton  grading  and \nmarketing systems, underpricing and undervaluation of baled cotton, and gin inefficiencies. \n \n22.  The current cotton classification and grading standard systems inadequately determine \nthe quality of the commodity, thus lowering the price received by farmers for their seed cotton \nand fiber cotton. Current Tajikstandard classification and practices in the grading of cotton5 do \nnot adequately reflect the quality of cotton and the price differential that can be obtained in the \nmarketplace. A new approach to classification and issuance of grade certificates is required to \nincrease the confidence of external buyers in the quality of the cotton sold and to improve the \nprice of Tajik baled cotton.  \n \n23.  Although there are 54 privately-owned gins6 in the country, most gins have low outturn \naverages and are underutilized. The ongoing inefficiencies of gins are largely due to lack of \ncompetition as a result of the restricted movement of cotton between districts. Farmers are \nunable to shift their seed cotton to another gin because of taxation arrangements for local \ngovernments.   \n \n24.  Gin  operators  are  also  the  investors  who  lend  to  farmers,  and  because  of  their \nmonopsinistic position, they are able to buy seed cotton on a heavily discounted basis and \nmanipulate cotton grades in favor of the ginner. Gin operators make payment to farmers only \nafter fiber cotton is shipped and funds are received from foreign buyers (6\u20137 months or longer \nafter receipt of the raw cotton). They retain ginning by-products which should be returned to \nfarmers (or paid for).  \n \n25.  The pricing formula exerts a downward push on the price of baled cotton. Tajik cotton is \nsold on the basis of lots (1 lot is approximately 50 tons) rather than individual bales; this further \nunderprices cotton, as the price is based on the lowest grade of cotton in a blended lot. The \npresent lot system results in at least 4% loss of the true value or at least $4,000 per 50 ton lot.  \n \n26.  Recent Steps to Improve Subsector. The Government has responded to the daunting \nchallenges of an underperforming cotton subsector, accumulating debt, and pervasive poverty \nin the subsector. In March 2005, the President of Tajikistan approved the Cotton Farm Debt \nResolution Strategy (CFDRS). The strategy has a two-pronged approach: (i) resolving the \nimmediate and urgent problem of a huge debt overhang through the facilitation of debt workouts \nbetween private lenders and private borrowers to ensure fair and equitable resolution of the \ndebt on a farm-by-farm basis; and (ii) a medium-term policy as well as legal and institutional \nmeasures that will enable a properly functioning cotton market. The proposed policy reforms \ninclude (i) removal of the cotton plan system and implicit quotas; (ii) secure land tenure; (iii) \ninternational grading standards; (iv) giving farmers freedom to choose what to grow and where \nto sell; and (v) creating a competitive, market-driven agricultural lending system. The strategy \ncalls for the establishment of an Independent Commission (IC) to oversee implementation.  \n                                                 \n5  The quality assessor of the gin factory performs the quality assessment and issuance of certificates; the weight of \nbales exported is also determined at the gin factory.  \n6  Of the 54 privately-owned gins, only 42 were in operation in early 2006. The majority of gins are owned or operated \nby investors. \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n \n27.  In May 2005, the IC was established.7 The IC developed the terms of reference, action \nplan, and guiding principles during an ADB-initiated, multi-donor funded retreat; and received \nprime ministerial assent to the final action plan in September 2005. The first priority of the action \nplan is to pilot test the conduct of debt analysis and the formulation of a workout strategy for \ndebt resolution in 12 heavily indebted farms. The technical assistance (TA) on Farm Analysis \nand Awareness-Raising for Debt Resolution8 will undertake these initial tasks, in partnership \nwith efforts under the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID) Third \nParty Arbitration Court project and the World Bank Lands Registration and Cadastre System for \nSustainable Agriculture Project.   \n \n28.  On 13 February 2006, ADB and World Bank officials met with the President of Tajikistan. \nDuring this meeting, ADB and the World Bank expressed the view that the rapid transformation \nof Tajikistan\u2019s cotton subsector is possible by focusing attention and actions in five key areas: \n \n(i)  Debt resolution. Cotton farm debts must be analyzed and the debt resolution \nplans  developed  on  a  farm-by-farm  basis,  and  through  transparent  and \nparticipatory approaches based on farmers\u2019 capacity to repay.  \n \n(ii)  Agricultural  financing  oversight.  A  transparent  and  sound  regulatory \nframework  for  agricultural  financing,  particularly  in  setting  the  rules  and \nmonitoring and enforcing such rules, must be worked out\u2014including alternative \nfinancing mechanisms for agriculture on a pilot scale and the implementation of \nthe bankruptcy law. \n \n(iii)  Farmers\u2019 freedom to choose. Farmers must be able to make fundamental farm \nmanagement decisions on their own, including what to produce, where and when \nto sell and process their produce, without interventions by the local authorities. \nFor this, the current practice of issuing production quota or production planning \nand processing targets must cease. \n \n(iv)  Secure land tenure. Individual farmers must be allowed to have their own land \nuse certificates which can be used as collateral.  \n \n(v)  Access  to  markets.  This  must  be  strengthened  by  implementing  an \ninternationally  recognized  cotton  classification  mechanism,  restructuring  the \npricing  mechanisms  and  encouraging  improved  auction  and  other  systems, \nadopting bonded warehouses, and installing other market facilitation measures. \n \n29.  In  the  subsequent  meeting  of  ADB  and  World  Bank  officials  with  the  President  of \nTajikistan on May 2006, it was agreed that the Government and the international community \nwould jointly develop a cotton subsector road map. Initial ideas of what the road map would \nprioritize were presented by the vice chair of the IC. The international community is currently \n                                                 \n7  The IC includes the state economic adviser to the President of Tajikistan (chairperson); the head of NBT (deputy \nchairman); and the following members: ministers of agriculture, state revenue and duties, water resources and land \nreclamation, energy, state land committee, chairman of KreditInvest, heads of economic reforms and investment \ndivision and agriculture division of the President\u2019s office, representatives of the Supreme Economic Court and \nMajilsy  Namoyandagon  Majlisi  Oly  (the  Parliament),  and  representatives  of  the  World  Bank  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank in the Tajikistan resident missions.  \n8  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Tajikistan for Farm Analysis and Awareness-Raising for Debt Resolution.  \nManila. The letter agreement for this technical assistance was signed on 7 March 2006.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  31 \ndeveloping its draft version, which essentially refocused and sequenced the priority policy areas \nidentified in the action plan for the CFDRS. The draft will be discussed with the Government and \nmajor stakeholders. The road map is perceived as a working document that will be continually \nrefined as intensive work on farm debt resolution is undertaken under ADB and World Bank \nprojects, and lessons are learned in the process.  \n \nF.  Conclusion \n \n30.  The above sector constraints have a profound impact on the livelihoods of the rural \nfarmers in Tajikistan. Compared with other sectors of the economy, incomes from agriculture \nare very low and it is estimated that rural incomes have dropped to less than 5% of urban wage \nrates. The increasing disparity has resulted in a paradoxical situation of falling rural incomes \nwhile the farm sector increasingly absorbs a high proportion of the growth in the working \npopulation.  Furthermore,  the  private  agribusiness  sector  remains  poorly  developed,  largely \nbecause of the unclear business environment. Private rural businesses involved in trading, \nprocessing, or construction activities are generally limited to small-scale operations with modest \ncapital investment. \n \n31.  The main binding constraint to be addressed by the Project is the current system of \nincentives, particularly the farm debt overhang, state production quota and the restrictive crop \nprocurement, and poor marketing and pricing policies and facilities. Reforms in these policies \nand practices will provide sufficient motivation and freedom of choice to private farmers to \nincrease investments in their land so that they can realize productivity gains, implement more \nsustainable cropping systems, and choose higher value products.  \n \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \nMAJOR EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE RELATED TO COTTON SUBSECTOR  \n(as of June 2006) \n      Project  Funding   Amount   Year \n   Source  ($ million) \nA.

The Sustainable Cotton Subsector Project has been prepared based largely on Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB) staff resources. However, two advisory technical assistance (TA) \nprojects1 provided key information and completed a number of necessary background activities.   \n \n2.  The  key  processing  steps  undertaken  to  date  were  as  follows:  (i)  Project \nReconnaissance Mission/Retreat/TA Fact-Finding, 4 June\u20138 July 2005; (ii) Loan Fact-Finding \nMission,  3\u201326  October  2005;  (iii)  Special  Processing  Mission,  13\u201318  February  2006; \n(iv) Appraisal Mission, 3\u201320 June 2006, and (v) Loan Negotiations, 29 September 2006.  \n \n3.  A  key  aspect  of  processing  has  been  the  consultative  process  initiated  by  ADB \n(Supplementary Appendix L). A three-day executive retreat was held in June 2005 involving \n16 minister-level members of the Independent Commission (IC) and several representatives \nfrom interested development partner agencies and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The \nretreat enabled IC participatory development of (i) a results-based and time-bound action plan \nfor the Cotton Farm Debt Resolution Strategy, later confirmed by the President of Tajikistan; (ii) \na vision statement and a mission statement; and (iii) improved guiding principles, terms of \nreference, and organizational structure for the IC. \n \n4.  A related advisory TA for enabling farm debt resolution processes was designed in April \n2005 and confirmed by the Government shortly after the retreat. The TA letter was not finalized \nuntil  March  2006  and  the  requirement  for  14  consultants  to  be  individually  selected  has \nsomewhat slowed its progress. However, lessons from this TA can be easily fed into the Project. \n \n5.  In order to address issues of poor households in a more substantive way, a related \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project has been planned. The objective of the JFPR \ngrant (Increasing Sustainable Income of Cotton Farm workers) is threefold: (i) to provide funding \nfor poor cotton farm workers who are predominantly women, to enhance farm-based incomes \nvia  microfinance  lending;  (ii)  to  improve  the  engagement  of  poor  households  in  cotton \nprocessing operations and management; and (iii) to improve the ability of cotton farm workers to \nmanage investments through capacity building training. An application for seed grant funding \nwas successfully undertaken in December 2005. The formal application, expected to be for $3.0 \nmillion, will be made by November 2006. \n \n6.  Aid coordination and cooperation have also been critical elements in loan processing, as \nthe farm debt resolution and cotton subsector reform will require joint engagement by a wide \nvariety of donors with significant resources to be successful. Multi-donor consultations on the \nproject concept, fit with existing and planned activities, and the potential for parallel financing \nwere explored during all four missions. The memorandum of agreement from the loan fact-\nfinding was presented to the IC and 16 donors, and ongoing parallel project on the Economic \nCotton Sector Recovery and Poverty Reduction is under way with the World Bank.  \n \n7.  Lastly, the Government showed strong commitment to ensuring a sustainable resolution \nof farm debt. In 2006, The President of Tajikistan spearheaded quarterly meetings including \nhimself, cabinet officials, and senior management of ADB and the World Bank (Supplementary \nAppendix A). To date, two meetings have been held. The first meeting identified the priority \nareas for the reform agenda. The second meeting agreed that a road map will be developed. \nThe  road  map  is  a  work-in-progress,  and  initial  ideas  are  incorporated  in  the  Project \n(Supplementary Appendix B).     \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nADF IX GRANT COMPONENT \n \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  financing  of  $12  million  for  the \nSustainable Cotton Subsector Project. From this total, the Government is requesting an Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) IX grant of $6.5 million to finance the following: (i) a farm debt \nworkout  and  resolution  process  for  four  raions  (districts)  in  Khatlon  and  Sughd;  (ii)  public \noutreach on farm debt resolution; (iii) policy reforms on farm debt resolution, poverty reduction, \nand market development; (iv) training of key agencies and stakeholders on the adoption of the \nuniversal cotton grading system; and (v) funding of the operations of the Common Center for \nProject Management (CCfPM). This appendix discusses the rationale, purpose, and activities of \nthe Project\u2019s grant-funded components.  \n \nA.  Constraints to Growth and Poverty Reduction  \n \n2.   Fiscal Weakness and Narrow Economic Base. At the macro level, Tajikistan has \naccumulated a massive external debt. Despite improvements in managing the fiscal deficit, the \nGovernment faces significant structural impediments that limit its capacity to invest in basic \nsocial services and infrastructure, and prevent the Government from initiating poverty reducing \nmeasures. One major structural bottleneck is its limited revenue sources. The Government \nrelies mainly on its narrow export base (aluminum, cotton, and hydropower) for tax receipts. In \npast  years,  the  cotton  subsector  alone  generated  about  35%  of  tax  revenues.1For  the \nGovernment to address its fiscal situation, the economy must diversify its income generating \nactivities and improve the performance of its existing revenue sources.  \n \n3.  Underperforming Cotton Subsector. The cotton subsector dominates the agriculture \nsector but it is performing at suboptimal levels. At the farm level, average yield in 2005 was a \nlow 1.55 tons per ha (tph) and was 1.25 tph short of the estimated yield level required for cotton \nfarms to earn reasonable profits. Labor productivity has also fallen. It takes 250\u2013350 person-\nhours to produce 1 ton of seed cotton, or more than four times the international competitive level \nof 70\u201380 person-hours.2 Input use has been suboptimal because of untimely delivery of vital \ninputs, a rise in input costs, poor input quality, and lack of access to appropriate forms of credit. \nIrrigation facilities have deteriorated and service delivery has been inefficient. Improper water \nand  land  use,  salinity,  and  waterlogging  problems  have  worsened;  and  land  quality  has \ndeclined.  \n \n4.  Farm Debt. A major factor for the underperformance of the subsector is the huge and \nunresolved debt of cotton farms with their creditors (referred to as \u201cinvestors\u201d). Farms mainly \naccess inputs, credit, and cotton income from the investors through the practice of annual \nproduction contract arrangements. However, the contracts are lopsided and prone to extraction \nof illicit rents in favor of the investor. In addition, when operated in an unfavorable business \nenvironment, the circumstances tend to further discourage farms to become more productive \nand other economic players to become efficient. The prognosis for economic recovery of the \nsubsector is bleak, as debt has been accumulating. Total outstanding cotton production debt \ncarryover from previous years\u2019 loans was estimated by the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) at \n$292.8 million in 2006. The cotton subsector needs immediate assistance to resolve its debt \nthrough an objective debt assessment using a variety of indebted farm cases and eventually, \nthe development of protocols and procedures for resolving the debt on a subsector-wide basis.  \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2006. Priorities for Sustainable Growth: A Strategy for Agriculture Sector Development in Tajikistan. \nWashington, D.C.: World Bank. \n2  ADB. 2004. Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms. Manila (final report under TA No. 4052-TAJ, 74). \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \n5.  Sources of Market Failures and Distortions. Sustainable resolution of the farm debt \nproblem requires addressing the symptom (i.e., debt at the farm level) as well as the root cause \n(government interference). Full economic recovery of the subsector will need the removal of \ngovernment interventions that distort the key operations in the subsector\u2019s value chain and \nmake the chain ineffective. Without freedom to decide farm production and marketing choices\u2014\nbecause the hukumat (district government) controls land use rights\u2014farmers have no incentive \nto become productive. Monopsonies3 in production credit and processing further reduce the net \nreturns that accrue to farmers. Policy reforms are essential and will need to be addressed jointly \nwith the farm debt resolution exercise. Initiating reforms will also require effective advocacy \nthrough continuous dialogue, public awareness raising, and the use of mass media. \n \n6.  Constraints  in  Capacities.  One  of  the  main  priorities  is  to  establish  an  efficient, \nintegrated, and cohesive cotton supply chain. To move toward this, the Project intends to work \non the root cause for and the symptom of farm debt. It also intends to invest in building the \ntechnical capacities required by the Independent Commission (IC) to decide and initiate policy \nreforms that effectively address the structural constraints afflicting the cotton subsector and the \nagriculture sector in general. These technical skills will be needed by the CCfPM that will link \nthe Project to the IC. Other technical skills that will be required are those that ensure the \nadoption of universal cotton grading standards, development of business plans, promotion of \nproducers\u2019 organizations, effective production contract arrangements, and other agreements \nthat will enable farmers to enhance their economic returns from cotton production.    \n \n7.  Balancing Act. The interventions in the cotton subsector require a strategic balancing \nact. On one hand, they have to pave the way for immediate sustainable broad-based growth; on \nthe other hand, they should not negatively impact on the present role of cotton as a major \nsource of government revenue and of employment and income to the vast majority of the rural \npoor. Measures will need to be developed that will (i) resolve the cotton farm debt issue and \nprovide  reform  measures  that  prevent  debt from  recurring;  and  (ii) address  the  farm  debt \nresolution jointly with measures that will remove the causes of market distortions in both the \nupstream  and  downstream  aspects  of  the  cotton  supply  chain.  A  more  market-driven \nenvironment in the cotton subsector will minimize inefficiencies caused by market distortions \nand the huge transaction costs that arise from the rent-seeking behavior of some actors in the \ncotton value chain. This new environment will provide farms the leverage to intensify their \nproduction as well as diversify their crop mix and income-generating opportunities.  \n \nB.  Proposed Activities \n \n8.  The grant component of the Project proposes to address the pressing problems of the \ncotton subsector that adversely affect its economic performance and its strategic role in poverty \nreduction, in a manner that will have minimal impact on the fiscal function of the Government. \nTherefore, priority will be given to developing a sustainable debt resolution strategy and an \nimproved marketing environment and capacity for the cotton subsector without exacerbating the \nstill precarious financial position of the Government. \n \n9.  A summary of the cost estimates for the grant is in Table A5.  \n \n                                                 \n3  Monopsony means single buyer. \n ", "  Appendix 5  37 \nTable A5: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amount  \nA.

For the agriculture finance innovation measure, a specialist will be engaged to \ncarry out the selection process for prospective PCBs. \n \n11.  The ADF IX grant will also support capacity building and an awareness program on the \nuse  and implementation  of  the  Universal  Cotton  Grading  Standards  (UCGS)  in  the  cotton \nsubsector. This is to ensure full stakeholder understanding of the classification system. An \nextensive  farmer  awareness  program  will  also  be  implemented,  with  sessions  conducted \nthroughout the cotton-growing regions of the country to ensure that all cotton farmers have \naccess to relevant information.  \n   \n12.  To expedite the export of baled cotton and maximize the value-added of the Project to \nthe  downstream  side  of  the  cotton  supply  chain,  the  ADF  IX  grant  will  support  legal  and \ntechnical specialists who will review the regulatory environment and propose changes that are \nneeded to encourage the development of bonded warehouses. It will also provide for the \npreparation of a business plan and prospectus for attracting international partners into the \ndevelopment of bonded warehousing and warehouse receipt programs, as well as training and \nlearning  visits  for  relevant  government  officials  on  the  benefits  and  operations  of  bonded \nwarehousing in countries that use these facilities successfully.  \n \n13.  The ADF IX will also support the operations of the CCfPM.4 The CCfPM, through its \npolicy and monitoring group, will build the technical skills of a working group to assist the IC in \nmaking effective policy decisions on farm debt and agriculture reform. Sharing the project \nimplementation  unit  under  the  CCfPM  with  the  World  Bank\u2019s  anticipated  Cotton  Sector \nRecovery and Poverty Reduction Project will encourage innovation in project management, and \nresult  in  cost  savings  and  more  sustainable  project  management  arrangements  for  the \nGovernment.   \n \n                                                 \n4  The CCfPM will have two wings- (i) the policy and monitoring group, which will oversee the policy, monitoring and \nadvocacy activities related to cotton farm debt resolution, and the (ii) project implementation unit (PIU) to be shared \nwith the World Bank\u2019s Cotton Sector Recovery and Poverty Reduction Project.  \n ", "38  Appendix 6 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national   Yes  Is the sector identified as a national priority   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?        No  in country poverty partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Republic of Tajikistan: Sustainable \ncotton subsector development will contribute significantly to reducing rural poverty in Tajikistan. Cotton farming \nis the major income source for rural households in Khatlon and Sughd, the two main cotton producing oblasts \n(regions) in Tajikistan that in 2003 were home to 72% of the poor and 75% of the extremely poor.1  \n \nSustained growth in cotton value is vital for significantly reducing the incidence of poverty in the country. It is \nalso crucial in spurring aggregate broad-based growth of the agriculture sector in particular and the national \neconomy in general. Cotton is grown on 60% of the country\u2019s irrigated farmland, and the cotton subsector in \n2004 generated 60% of the value of total agriculture output and is the largest employer of Tajikistan\u2019s rural \nlabor force. It is the primary export crop of the agriculture sector, accounting for 75\u201390% of agriculture exports. \nCotton, fruits, vegetables, and aluminum constitutes  40% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and \n70% of export earnings. The cotton subsector generated 35% of tax revenues.   \n \nThe growth of Tajikistan\u2019s cotton subsector has not been pro-poor. The decline in poverty observed in the \ngrowth years of 1998\u20132003 was due to the remittances generated by migrant workers, and to the lower relative \nprices of food and other main expenditure items of the rural populace. The impact of improvements in cotton \nyield and output value from 1998 to 2003 on poverty reduction was insignificant. A World Bank study (Abdulai, \nA. 2005. Agriculture and Poverty under Economic Reforms in Tajikistan. Washington, D.C World Bank.) noted \nthat a 10% increase in yield and output value of cotton resulted in a mere 1.5% reduction in poverty.  \n \nPoverty reduction during these growth years was lowest in Khatlon (15%) and Sughd (13%) relative to the \nnational poverty reduction rate of 20%. The probability of being poor is higher in the two cotton-growing areas \nthan in other oblasts. Khatlon alone, which has a third of the country\u2019s population, accounts for more than half \nof the total number of extremely poor households in Tajikistan. Inequality is also most severe in Khatlon and it \nhas even worsened from 1999 to 2003. The root cause of income poverty in Khatlon and Sughd, where the \nmajority  of  the  poor  resides,  is  the  underperformance  of  the  cotton  subsector.  This  subsector  is \nunderperforming because of (i) huge farm debt that has paralyzed credit and investment generation to the \nsubsector, and (ii) structural bottlenecks that induce market distortions in the cotton\u2019s supply value chain and \nreduce the income of cotton farms. Reversing the poor economic performance of cotton farms is thus a priority \nagenda for alleviating rural income poverty in Tajikistan. At present, migration to non-poor regions or to the \nRussian Federation and wealthier neighboring countries is the main way the poor use to exit from poverty.  \n \nB. Poverty Analysis     Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? The poverty analysis for this Project focused on an assessment of \nincome poverty from the perspective of (i) low-income cotton farm households; and (ii) vulnerable groups, \nincluding cotton farm workers, women farm workers and farmers, and child labor during the cotton harvesting \nseasons. \n \nLow-Income Cotton Farmers. Cotton has a strategic role in generating fiscal revenues, so the Government \nhas maintained a strong grip on the key operations in the subsector\u2019s value chain. A production quota for cotton \nis targeted annually and local governments ensure that the targets are met. Cotton farmers do not have the \nfreedom to decide what to produce in their farmland, where to buy their inputs, and where to sell their produce. \nKey production decisions at the farm level are under the control of the local governments, exercised through \ntheir authority to allocate and confiscate agricultural land from the farmers on the basis of vaguely worded \ncriteria such as \u201cirrational land use.\u201d Farmers, too, are confined to obtaining credit only from investors \ndesignated by local governments, and are bound to have their produce processed in gins designated by local \n                                                 \n1  The poverty line used to define the poor in the World Bank study was purchasing power parity (PPP) $2.15 a day, \nwhile the poverty line for the extremely poor was PPP $1.08 a day. The 2000 PPP conversion rate was employed \nin  defining  these  thresholds.  These  poverty  definitions  were  complemented  by  self-assessment  of  poverty \nsituations through interviews and focus group discussions. (World Bank. 2005. Poverty Assessment Update- \nRepublic of Tajikistan. Washington DC: World Bank). \n ", "  Appendix 6  39 \ngovernments. Because of lack of competition from credit sources for inputs and gin processing, farmers incur \nnumerous implicit rents, such as overpriced low quality inputs, untimely delivery of these inputs, processing \ntime in excess of 200 days, under-grading of seed cotton, poor storage facilities in gins, and underpricing of \nfiber cotton. Profits are squeezed from the farmers, who then accumulate debt ranging from $500 per hectare \n(ha) to more than $8,000/ha. Debt accumulation and structural constraints served as disincentives to farmers to \nbecome productive. The overall impact on the subsector is devastating. In 2005, cotton production further \ndeclined to 447,922 tons, and yield plummeted to 1.55 tons per ha. \n \nFarmers hardly get any share of the benefits from the downstream activities of the supply chain. Instead, they \nbear the costs, including those brought about by the delays in the receipt of their revenues from fiber cotton \nand by the inappropriate grading and classification of fiber cotton. The value of seed cotton to ex-gin gate price \nis just 26%, while the value share of the cost, insurance, freight (CIF) price of fiber cotton to the free on board \n(FOB) price of fiber cotton is 52%. This is much lower than what the Australian farmer receives, which is 90\u2013\n92%.    \n \nA study correlating productivity with poverty reduction showed a weak relation between the two, implying that \nincreased yield would not be sufficient to lift poor cotton farm households out of poverty. What is required are \nhigher economic returns arising from more transparent and competitive access to agriculture finance, lower \ncosts of inputs, timely delivery of the right amounts of quality inputs, fair prices for farm produce, a level playing \nfield for gin owners, and freedom for farmers to diversify their income sources through best crop mix and \naccess to off-farm employment.  \n   \nFarm Workers and Women. Cotton farm workers are another disadvantaged group in the subsector. They \nconstitute the bulk of the rural labor force and the rural poor. They are paid dismally low wages. In 2004, wages \nfor planting and preparatory work ranged from only $0.40\u2013$2.00 per month per worker; for picking seed cotton \nby hand, payment was only $0.02\u20130.03 per kilogram (kg).  \n \nMore than 75% of the estimated 400,000 farm workers in the subsector are women. A large number of the rural \nmale labor force has migrated to the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan to increase their household income. \nIn 2003, 41% of migrant workers in the former Soviet Union were from Khatlon. Thus, farm work is left mainly to \nfemale-headed households, the elderly, and the young. With hardly any off-farm and nonfarm employment \nopportunities, female farm workers have no option but to continue working on cotton farms while fulfilling their \nhousehold responsibilities. Working in cotton farms enables them to access garden plots, averaging 0.1\u20130.3 \nha, where they grow their food and other crops to be sold in the market. The other incentive of working on \ncotton farms is that they can collect ghuzpoya (dried cotton bush or stalks used for cooking and heating during \nwinter). The women workforce in the subsector has less opportunity for holding key management positions in \ncotton farms. Less than 5% of managers in the cotton farm associations are women, although an estimated \n65% of farmers and more than 75% of farm workers are women. \n \nA study concluded that a 10% increase in cotton wages would significantly reduce poverty by as much as 3%. \nThis impact would be much higher than the impact of seed cotton yield improvements on poverty. However, an \nincrease in wages can only be sustained if the indebted cotton farms become financially viable economic \nenterprises. There is a need to address the structural impediments in the production and marketing aspects of \nthe cotton value chain that hamper the overall sustainable development of the cotton subsector. Because of the \nlarge composition of women involved in the cotton subsector labor force, there is also a need for broad-based, \ngrowth-enhancing measures that address the needs of women farm workers and farmers.   \n \nChild Labor. Minors (8\u201314 years), together with employees from the public and private sectors, are also \nemployed especially during harvesting season. Even during Tajikistan\u2019s pre-independence years, all available \nhands in the country were used to work in the cotton farms. Coupled with the scarcity of income opportunities, \nthis nonmarket labor recruitment network has become an acceptable working norm. School classes and formal \nwork from public and private institutions are disrupted during the harvest period. Schoolchildren are sent to \ncotton fields each year, live in badly equipped and cramped barracks while working in the fields, get minimal \nsubsistence allowance, and get paid on an output basis after the harvest. Anecdotal cases have documented \nharsh working conditions such as long working hours under the summer heat, which can rise to 100\u00b0 \nFahrenheit; health problems (from exhaustion to intestinal and respiratory infections); and low remuneration \nthat leads to debt.  \n \nAddressing the problem of employing child labor in the cotton subsector cannot be resolved overnight. A long-\nlasting solution to this concern is inextricably linked to ensuring broad-based and sustainable growth of the \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \ncotton subsector. A more robust subsector will pay farm workers better, open more livelihood and job options \nwithin and outside the cotton subsector, and reduce the economic necessity of engaging child and adolescent \nlabor during the cotton harvesting season.  \n \nPoverty Reduction Strategy of the Project. The impact of the Project is the development of an economically \nsustainable cotton subsector in Tajikistan\u2019s two major cotton-producing regions, Khatlon and Sughd. A key \nindicator to achieving this impact is that income poverty in these regions would have been reduced by 2015 to \n26% for Khatlon and 24% for Sughd. To lay the foundation for the reduction of poverty in the cotton subsector, \nthe Project\u2019s interventions will address the farm debt in four raions (districts), provide alternative financing \nproducts and services to restructured farms, and ensure market development at the downstream side of the \nsupply value chain. Policy reforms will reduce the producers\u2019 disincentive to produce efficiently, minimize illicit \nrents, and enhance quality and pricing of both seed cotton and fiber cotton. These broad-based growth-\nenhancing measures at strategic levels of the supply chain will be complemented with proactive measures that \n(i) address the income poverty of low-income indebted cotton farms; (ii) tackle the vulnerability of farm workers, \nespecially female farm workers and farmers; and (iii) create incentives to reduce the use of child labor during \nharvesting season. In the farm debt workout and resolution process, preference will be accorded to small-sized \nfarmland users and women farmers with low-income returns at or below the poverty threshold, farms with a \nlarge number of poor to extremely poor farm workers, and farm households headed by females. Potential areas \nfor improving incomes derived from cotton farm production that will be explored are: (i) decreases in the illicit \ncosts caused by lopsided contract agreements; (ii) improved yield arising from increased producer\u2019s incentives; \n(iii) improved pricing of seed cotton, and returns from the by-products, and (iv) higher shares due to increased \nefficiency in fiber cotton processing and marketing and distribution. The other potential area for improving \nincomes is the opportunity of farmers to diversify their crop mix, thus reducing their dependence on cotton \nmonoculture production. This will arise from the removal of hukumat (district government) intervention in the \nfarms\u2019 production and decision-making process.  \n \nFarm debt resolution will take into account the social and poverty implications and will ensure that mitigation \nmeasures are included in the resolution agreements to address these issues. For farms that are declared \nbankrupt, the resolution agreements will include mitigation measures to minimize adverse implications on poor \nfarm households and vulnerable groups employed in the farms. Business plans of restructured farms that have \nundergone and completed the farm debt resolution process will include mitigation measures to avert any \nadverse implications on the well-being of vulnerable groups during the transition years toward recovery. \n \nAwareness raising of the rights of farmers, women, and children will be incorporated in the public outreach \nactivities of the Project. Policy studies on concerns of cotton farmers, women farm workers and use of child \nlabor will be conducted to provide mitigating measures that can be acted upon by the Independent Commission \n(IC). To raise awareness and encourage social discourse among these stakeholders, regular feedback will be \nprovided to the IC on such monitoring indicators as poverty and the risks and vulnerability of women farmers \nand farm workers and child labor. \n \nBecause of the significant gender dimension and high poverty situation among farm workers, a separate Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) project is being developed in tandem with the Project. The JFPR project \nwill provide direct microfinance access to women to broaden their income opportunities, and provide training \nand capacity building on technical, financial and empowerment skills.    \n            \nMethod of Poverty Analysis and Monitoring the Results. A more rigorous stakeholder assessment will be \nundertaken in the pilot raions during the inception mission and will be verified at least twice a year during the \nProject\u2019s implementation period. The assessment at the initial stage will look at stakeholders\u2019 interests in \nmaintaining and changing the status quo in the cotton subsector operations, the nature and degree of political \ninfluence at the raion and national levels, and the options for minimizing conflicts. Indicators will be developed \nfor the major target beneficiaries using a participatory approach. This will be followed through the conduct of \nstakeholder assessments on a semiannual basis. In the process, early warning signals will be devised for \nconsideration by the IC that will forewarn policy makers in the event that the poverty situation of the vulnerable \ngroups is threatened by external and internal factors.   \n \nAt the project level, farm-by-farm analysis will be done in a participatory manner, involving key stakeholders in \nthe farm debt. The analysis will include documentation of the poverty, risks, and vulnerability profile of farmers \nand farm workers by gender, as well as the use of child and adolescent labor.  \n \nFor each project output, monitoring indicators that relate the Project\u2019s performance on the poor and vulnerable \n ", "  Appendix 6  41 \ngroups in the project areas will be determined in a participatory manner during the stakeholder dialogues at the \ninception phase of project implementation. Benchmark data will be gathered and disaggregated by gender and \nby age and according to the targeted vulnerable groups. The Common Center for Project Management will \nprovide regular feedback to the IC on the progress of the poverty-related assessments and indicators for the \ndifferent vulnerable groups. \n \nTo measure the impact of the Project on the poverty and vulnerability of the poor and vulnerable groups, the \nvalue chain analysis will be employed to identify the foregone value and volume of seed cotton and fiber cotton \nthat should have accrued (Appendix 11). This value chain analysis will also be the basis for determining the \nemployment and revenue losses to key stakeholders resulting from policy and institutional practices that induce \nmarket distortions. The use of a qualified transmission channel approach will complement this type of analysis. \nThis approach will be employed to assess the distributional impact on income and relevant non-income poverty \nof the intervention measures.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA preliminary stakeholder analysis was done to determine the key stakeholders at the cotton farm production \nphase (Supplementary Appendix M). Another stakeholder assessment was done during the fact-finding mission \nto  determine  the  major  players  in  the  downstream  (marketing)  aspects  of  the  supply  value  chain \n(Supplementary Appendix L).  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe participatory strategy will be developed during the inception mission in tandem with the stakeholder \nassessment.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: Because of the dominant role that women play in the cotton \nsubsector, the Project puts strong emphasis on the active participation of women in the implementation phase. \nDuring implementation, consultation processes in the four raions for the farm debt resolution component will \ntake into account women\u2019s involvement. Indebted farms that are headed by women will be given priority in the \nfarm-by-farm analysis. Representation of indebted farms that are run by women and of women farm workers \nwill be ensured during policy dialogues with national and local governments. A gender action plan will be \ndeveloped during project implementation.  \n \nThe economic benefits of the market development component will accrue to both male and female cotton-\ngrowing farmers. However, to ensure that benefits of this component are gender-neutral, a monitoring and \nevaluation system will be developed, and the starting point will be the determination of gender-disaggregated \nperformance indicators for all project components.  \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nParticipation strategy for the project will be done and completed during the inception mission of the Project.  \n \nE.

The \u201cWithout Project\u201d Scenario \n \n1.  The Players. The major players in the cotton subsector of Tajikistan are the (i) farmers \nand  farm  workers;  (ii)  ginners;  (iii)  investors;  (iv)  exporters  and  traders;  and  (v)  local \nconsumers/buyers,  mostly  spinners  and  oil  refiners.  Although  the  operations  in  the  cotton \nsubsector are private sector-led, the Government still plays a key role at strategic points of the \nsupply chain. The major players in the Government are: (i) the central government, which sets \nannual production targets and allocates these among the raions (districts); (ii) the rais (district \ngovernor), who ensures that production targets are met by requiring farmers to cultivate cotton \nin at least 70% of their farmland, and restricting movement of cotton through its one-gin and \none-investor policy; (iii) Tajikstandard, which certifies the cotton quality in coordination with the \ngin laboratories; and (iv) Tajikistan Universal Goods Exchange (TUGE), which regulates the \npricing for fiber cotton and for inputs used in cotton production. \n \n2.  The bulk of baled fiber cotton produced in Tajikistan (about 85%) is exported. The \nbalance is sold to domestic spinning and textile industries. The value of fiber cotton comprises \nabout 70% of the value1 of seed cotton. By-products\u2014mainly oil, cake, meal, and linters\u2014\ncomprise about 30% of the value of seed cotton and are consumed locally.  \n \n3.  Value Chain for Cotton. Figure A11.1 shows the value chain of Tajikistan cotton, and \nthe relations of the various players. Vertical integration in the supply value chain is essentially \ninvestor-driven. The majority of these investors plays many roles\u2014input supplier through crop \nfinancing with the farmer, gin owners or major stockholders of gins, and local traders and \nexporters.  \n \nFigure A11.1.

Figure A11.2 illustrates the numerous points along the value chain where losses in \nvolume or price (as shown by the double bar boxes) reduce the total margin and overall value of \nfiber cotton and by-products. The first incremental loss in the value chain is the lower yield of \nthe farmers because they have no incentive to become more productive or innovative in their \nuse of land. In 2005, the yield averaged 1.55 ton per ha (tph), which is far below the yield \npotential of 2.80 tph that would result in normal returns to farmers.2  \n \n5.  Farmers\u2019 losses increase at the gin level. It is estimated that under-weighing of farmers' \nseed cotton at the gin door results in volume losses of about 2%. There is also theft and under-\nweighing of baled fiber cotton and cotton by-products in cotton gins, estimated at 6\u20138% of the \nseed cotton weight. An additional discount on seed cotton is charged by gin owners for moisture \ncontent of the seed cotton, which is about 1.5% of the seed cotton yield.  \n \n6.  Aside from under-weighing the seed cotton, gin owners buy the farmers\u2019 produce at a \nprice that is well below its real market value. Gin owners effectively discount the price paid for \nraw cotton by as much as 10%. This is a form of subsidy to the gins for their low outturn ratio \n(less than 32% versus 36\u201340% of other cotton producing countries). An additional 5% is again \ndeducted from the farm gate price because of the long ginning processing time (200 days as \nopposed to the normal 90 days for processing time). Moreover, many gin owners do not return \nall of the by-products of seed cotton to the farmers, thus depriving them of the revenue they are \ndue for their seed cotton.   \n \n7.  The pricing of fiber cotton is also under-valued through the pricing formula3 that is set by \nTUGE. In this formula, international buyers are offered a 5% discount on the purchase of \nTajikistan cotton based on the price of second-grade fiber cotton and not on the actual quality of \nthe baled fiber cotton. The standardized second grade classing of the fiber cotton quality applied \nby TUGE in the pricing formula is because of the inadequacy of the current cotton classification \nsystem. The flawed grading system of fiber cotton reduces the price of Tajik fiber cotton by as \nmuch as 8\u201310%. It is estimated that the current classification system results in losses of \nrevenue to the cotton subsector of as much as $13 million per annum. Foreign merchants \nunder-weigh the baled cotton that is shipped for export to lower their tax costs. This costs the \nGovernment about $2 million per annum in tax revenue.4 \n   \n8.  The overall leakage in the value chain of the cotton subsector, in terms of volume of \nseed cotton from the farm production level up to the export and local buyer destination, amounts \nto about 656 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha), or 189,600 ton (t) per year. Of this foregone seed \ncotton amount, about 60% is due to the inefficient use and allocation of inputs arising from the \nasymmetric implementation of the production contract arrangements. In terms of foregone fiber \ncotton at a 32% gin outturn, the volume loss for the country is about 56,000 t per year. At the \ncurrent free on board (FOB) price, the foregone opportunity costs to the subsector in terms of \nfiber cotton earnings are about $75 million. The incremental additional loss because of low gin \noutturns (presently at 32% outturn), ranges from $11 million (if the outturn would increase to \n34%) to $21 million (if the outturn is at 36%). These values still exclude the returns from the by-\nproducts. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Figure A11.2 uses 1.8 tph, which is the long-term average yield instead of the low 1.55 tph recorded in 2005. \n3  The pricing formula for fiber cotton adjusts the export cost, insurance, freight (CIF) price to a free on board (FOB) \nprice. TUGE oversees the implementation of the formula. Compared to pricing formulae employed by other \ncountries, TUGE\u2019s pricing formula includes many adjustment factors aside from insurance, freight, transport, and \nhandling costs. The FOB price is also pegged at lower grade cotton. These discount factors effectively reduce the \nprice received by the Tajik exporter. For example, in 2004, the FOB price for cotton in Tajikistan averaged $1,226 \nper ton, which was 85% of the FOB price for cotton in Uzbekistan.     \n4  World Bank. 2005.

The financial farm gate equivalent price for seed cotton is estimated to be $238 per ton \nwithout the Project and $354 per ton with the Project\u2014an increase of 49%. The Project will \nresult in an increase of the percentage return5 for farms from 52% to 67% for fiber cotton, a \ndecrease from 20% to 9% for ginners, a decrease from 14% to 12% for buyers, and no change \nat 13% for the Government.

Apart  from  significant  benefits  to  farms  from  the  Project,  the  Government  will  also \nreceive an estimated increase in its export tax of $18 per ton or $2.3 million per annum on the \n                                                 \n5  Returns to each party are expressed as a percentage of the pre-export tax price for fiber cotton. \n ", "  Appendix 11 57\n   \nbasis of 126,157 t of cotton exports in 2005.6 The higher ginning outturn and higher on-farm \nyields will create additional volumes of fiber cotton for export. These effects will be offset to the \nextent that a change in the allowable cropping pattern reduces the area of cotton grown. \nHowever,  in  the  longer  term,  as  the  Project  leads  to  higher  returns  from  growing  cotton \n(e.g., compared to wheat), it is expected that the net effect will be for an overall increase in seed \ncotton and fiber cotton production.   \n \n12.  Financial  crop  budgets  for  cotton,  wheat,  and  other  crops  (alfalfa  is  used  as  a \nrepresentative of \u201cother crops\u201d) show the combined impacts of the various project interventions \non the farms selected for targeted assistance in the four selected raions. In addition to the \nimprovement in the farm gate price for seed cotton, the Project is expected to increase on-farm \ncotton yields from 1.8 t/ha to 2.4 t/ha, and allow a more profitable cropping pattern for the \nselected farms. \n \n13.  It is assumed that, as a consequence of the Project, there is no change in the net \nrevenue per ha for wheat and other crops. However, because of the improved net financial \nreturns for cotton and the change in the cropping pattern with the Project, the weighted average \nnet revenue per ha increases from \u2013$72 to $219\u2014an increase of $147 per ha in net revenue. \nOn the basis of the 15,714 ha covered by the full project interventions, the increase in net farm \nincome at full project benefits is $4.6 million per annum.  \n \n14.  These farm level financial analysis results are conservative in that the analysis includes \nonly benefits related to the production of 11,000 ha of cotton in the project area. However, the \ncotton market development initiatives of the Project will have beneficial impacts on the prices \nreceived by farms for seed cotton beyond the immediate project area. On the basis of 448,000 t \nof seed cotton produced in 2005, the increase in price received by farmers as a consequence of \nthe Project implies an increase in total farm income of $52 million per annum.  \n \n15.  Economic  Impact.  The  economic  analysis  has  been  undertaken  in  terms  of  the \ndomestic price numeraire in 2006 constant prices, and a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.117 \nwas applied to the internationally traded component of costs and benefits. Economic prices for \nseed cotton for the without and with the Project scenarios have been estimated based on similar \ncalculations as for the financial price estimates. However, a number of transformations have \nbeen undertaken to convert from financial to economic prices.  \n \n16.  Economic crop budgets with and without the Project have been prepared. An economic \nlife of 30 years from 2007 to 2036 has been assumed, and no residual value of benefits has \nbeen assumed at the end of this period, even though the benefits should continue indefinitely. \nZero benefits in year 1 (2007) of the Project have been assumed, one third of full project annual \nbenefits in year 2 (2008), two thirds in year 2 (2009), and full project annual benefits from year 4 \n(2010) onwards. \n \n17.  The economic price for seed cotton increases from $330/t without the Project to $430/t \nwith the Project\u2014an increase of 30%. The base case economic analysis gives an economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) of 28.7%. Sensitivity testing indicates that the EIRR remains above \n20% with a reduction of 10% in the average cotton yield achieved with the Project (i.e., the yield \n                                                 \n6  Equal to 448,000 ton of seed cotton produced (Source: Ministry of Agriculture. 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Irrigation Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila.  \n ", "    Appendix 12  59\n \nSUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW \n \n1.  The Project is expected to produce no environmental impact as it will not (i) involve any \nmajor construction that requires resettlement or land acquisition; (ii) invest in the construction of \ndams, new canals, or head-works that would allow increased water abstraction from main \nsources; (iii) enlarge the land area planted to cotton; and (iv) will not increase the use of \npesticides. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) classifies the project as category C, which \nrequires  environmental  review  from  the  sector  perspective.  Below  is  a  summary  of  the \nenvironmental review. The full review is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \nA.  Environmental Review and Implications on Project Intervention  \n \n2.  Efficiency of Water Use. In Tajikistan, the most pressing environmental problem of \nagricultural  production  is  land  degradation.  This  is  due  mainly  to  erosion,  salinization, \nwaterlogging, and desertification. Soil fertility has also been considerably reduced because of \npesticide  contamination  and  runoff  of  nutrients  from  agricultural  fields.  Since  cotton  is  the \npredominant crop on irrigated lands, its cultivation is at the core of environmental concerns in \nTajikistan\u2019s agriculture. \n \n3.  Tajikistan's irrigated areas are devoted to cotton (which accounts for more than half of \nthe value of crop production), grain, fodder, potatoes, vegetables, melons, vineyards, and fruit \ntrees. About 85% of the irrigated land is found in Khatlon and Sughd, Tajikistan\u2019s major cotton \ngrowing regions.  \n \n4.  The partial breakdown of Tajikistan\u2019s irrigation system is among the reasons for the \nsteady decline of the cotton yields. Water is not delivered to dehkan (small-sized individual or \nfamily-owned farms with land use rights) farms on time and in the required quantities. The state \nof the drainage infrastructure is even in worse condition than the irrigation infrastructure. This \nresults in high water tables, waterlogging, and salinity of the soil. In turn, poor drainage in the \nfarms leads to wasteful use of water. It is estimated that 115,000 ha of the arable land in \nTajikistan1 is adversely affected by excessive use of water. \n \n5.  The average irrigation efficiency at the farm level in Tajikistan is 28%.2 Studies have \nshown that water application can be reduced to at least a third of current levels, and actual water \nuse can be reduced from the present high-usage level of 15,000 cubic meters (m3) to 5,000 m3. \nHowever,  for  this  to  happen,  a  combination  of  the  following  measures  are  required: \n(i) rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage facilities, (ii) regular operation and maintenance of \nthese facilities, (iii) the use of land-leveling technologies and improved agronomic practices, and \n(iv) a more level playing field and market environment for the cotton supply chain.3  \n \n6.  The Project aims to improve economic returns accruing to cotton farmers and farm \nworkers  through  the  following  measures:  (i)  farm  debt  resolution  in  four  raions  (district \ngovernment), (ii) access to alternative financing for restructured farms, (iii) policy reform to give \nfarmers more freedom to decide their farm and processing activities, and (iv) policy reform to \nensure better pricing for fiber cotton through the adoption and implementation of a universal \ncotton grading standards (UCGS) as well as the development of bonded warehouses. Together \nwith farm reorganization, these measures will give farmers a stronger incentive to produce \nefficiently and to cost effectively the use of their inputs, including irrigation water. In addition, \nvarious donor organizations are assisting farmers to organize themselves into water users\u2019 \nassociations that can introduce cost recovery mechanisms. The total effect of these reform \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. Rural Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project. 2000. Washington, D.C.: World Bank. \n2  According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), \"around 84% of all water used in Tajikistan is \nconsumed by the agricultural sector, yet only half of the water is thought to reach the crops\u2014the rest is lost to \nevaporation  and  inefficiency  of  the  irrigation  infrastructure\u201d  (UNDP.  Tapping  the  potential:  Improving  water \nmanagement in Tajikistan. Natural Human Development Report. Tajikistan: UNDP.) \n3  ADB.  2004. Farm Debt Resolution and Policy Reforms. Manila. Annex 4. \n ", "60   Appendix 12 \nmeasures will be significant in terms of lowering water consumption. Experts estimate that in the \ncase of cotton, wheat, and corn planted in the driest areas of Tajikistan, the irrigation water \nconsumption could be reduced from the present average as follows: from 12,000 m3/ha to \n8,000 m3/ha for cotton; from 10,000 m3/ha to 3,000 m3/ha for wheat; and from 9,100 m3/ha to \n7,600 m3/ha for corn.  \n \n7.  Reduction of seepage losses from main canals and oversupply of irrigation will also have \na beneficial effect on farms in terms of a lower water table, lower risk of salinity, and fewer \nstagnant water pools in settlements that can cause health problems.  \n \n8.  Implications from Pesticide Use. Although Tajikistan took the lead in biological crop \npest  control  during  the  Soviet  era,  its  pest  control  practice  at  present  relies  heavily  on \nchemicals. The biocontrol facilities that used to supply beneficial insects to the farms are no \nlonger operational. Based on studies and field visits, farms now intensively use pest control \nchemicals, particularly in the lower valleys that practice cotton monoculture.  \n \n9.  There are anecdotal reports of the continued use of harmful levels of toxic pesticides, \nherbicides, and defoliants throughout Tajikistan because of the country\u2019s heavy use of chemical \npest control methods before the 1990s. However, inadequate monitoring makes it difficult to \ndetermine the magnitude of the problem. \n \n10.  The findings of this review show the following to be very common in Tajikistan: (i) use of \nWorld  Health  Organization  Class  1  and  unregistered  chemicals  purchased  from  the  black \nmarket;  (ii)  inappropriate  storage  and  use  of  pesticides  and  lack  of  safety  precautions  in \npesticide application; (iii) improper disposal of waste and chemical packaging; (iv) inadequate \nenforcement of laws and regulations on labeling and sales of agricultural chemicals; (v) low \nlevels  of  awareness  on  integrated  pest  management  (IPM)  among  officials,  farmers,  and \nchemical resellers and traders; and (vi) general lack of public awareness of the environmental \nand health implications of the improper use of pesticides. If IPM is not strongly advocated and \nwidely  enforced  in  Tajikistan,  farm  reorganization  and  debt  resolution  may  lead  to  more \nintensive agriculture practices that use more of agrochemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, \nand herbicides. \n \n11.  In addition, if farmers do not have a clear understanding of the need for the proper \nstorage, transport, and application of pesticides and herbicides, the chemical runoff from the \nfields could significantly pollute both surface and ground water and cause health problems \namong the populace. Therefore, it is necessary to promote IPM, particularly in disseminating \nknowledge  on:  (i)  managing  pests  to  keep  them  below  economically  damaging  levels; \n(ii) biological pest control techniques, increased reliance on cultural methods for weed control, \nand increased organic fertilization to reduce overall use of agrochemical inputs; and (iii) the safe \napplication of less toxic pesticides. The use of IPM would minimize the adverse effects of \nagrochemical on nontarget organisms, human health, and the biophysical environment. \n \nB.  Findings and Recommendations  \n \n12.  Project activities are not anticipated to have direct impacts on the environment. Instead, \nthey  may  have  indirect  positive  impacts  on  land  management,  water  management,  and \npesticide management by the target dehkan farms. Only the laboratory upgrade in three sites, \nas well as the warehouse upgrades in two sites, may have potential limited direct environmental \nimpact. Specifically, these activities will have: (i) short-term construction impact associated with \nminor reconstruction of laboratory and warehouse facilities, resulting in some noise, dust, and \nwaste  material;  (ii) short-term  minor  congestion  problems  on  construction  sites;  and \n(iii) occupational health and possible public health hazards that may be caused by the improper \nuse or accidental spillage of sulfuric acid when the laboratory becomes operational. The short-\nterm construction impacts can be minimized by making it mandatory for the contractor to follow \n ", "    Appendix 12  61\n \nbest practices in construction, waste minimization and disposal, and traffic control. The risk of \naccidental spillage of sulfuric acid can be mitigated by requiring the contractor implementing this \nproject component to observe internationally and nationally recognized environmental health \nand safety procedures. The contractor will also be required to provide training, especially for \nlaboratory employees, on best management practices on the solid and potentially hazardous \nwaste generated by the laboratory.  \n \n13.  The Project may also prevent possible indirect negative impacts on the environment \nrelated to (i) water use (such as waterlogging and salinization); (ii) pesticide use (particularly in \nthe  use  of  unregistered  chemicals,  improper  handling  of  agrochemicals,  inadequate \nenforcement of laws on labeling and sales of agrochemicals, and nonobservance of the IPM \nsystem); and (iii) land use by the target farms (soil erosion, improper use of fertilizers and \nagrochemicals, and ineffective irrigation and drainage systems). The potential indirect negative \nimpacts on the environment can be mitigated by the following activities: (i) awareness programs \non sustainable practices on water, pesticides and IPM, and land use; (ii) experience-sharing \nbetween the Project\u2019s target farms with dehkan farms and members of successful water users\u2019 \nassociations on modem irrigation and drainage systems as well as on-farm water and land \nmanagement  technologies  (such  as  crop  rotation,  fertility,  and  land  productivity); \n(iii) development of appropriate regulations to enforce proper labeling, sales, handling, and safe \ndisposal of agricultural chemicals. This will be undertaken to support the Persistent Organic \nPollutants (POPs) unit within the State Committee for Environmental Protection and Forestry \nand other relevant government agencies; and (iv) requesting commercial banks to put in place \nprocedures that will ensure proper consideration and review of the possible environmental \nconsequences of proposed activities.   \n \n14.  ADB has recently approved a regional technical assistance (RETA) on Partnership on \nPersistent Organic Pollutants Pesticides Management for Agricultural Production in Central Asia \nand Caucasus Countries.4 The RETA will focus on IPM adoption, especially in cotton growing \nareas. Tajikistan will be one of the participating countries that will benefit from the technical and \ncapacity  building  measures  of  the  RETA.  These  measures  are  designed  to  promote \nenvironment-friendly  alternative  pest  control  practices  in  cotton  production,  and  identify  a \nsustainable funding mechanism for the cleanup and management of sites contaminated with \npersistent organic pollutant pesticides.  \n \nC.  Conclusions \n   \n15.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  environmental  requirements  as  well  as  Tajikistan\u2019s  environmental \nlegislation currently in force, the Project does not require any environmental impact assessment \nor other environmental review of any potential negative impacts. However, as soon as the \nProject is approved, it would be advisable to consult with the State Committee for Environmental \nProtection and Forestry and obtain further guidance on compliance requirements with the State \nEcological Expertise. This is considering the fact that Tajikistan's environmental legislation lacks \nan environmental impact assessment categorization system and that the State Committee for \nEnvironmental  Protection  and  Forestry  decides  on  environmental  impact  assessment \nprocedures on a case-to-case basis. \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2006.
