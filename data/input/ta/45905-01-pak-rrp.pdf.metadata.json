I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npartial credit guarantee (PCG) of up to $33.43 million issued by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  in  favor  of  the  Islamic  Development  Bank  (IDB)  in  respect  of  IDB\u2019s  financing  of \nFoundation Wind Energy I Limited for the Foundation Wind Energy I Project in Pakistan and \n(ii) a proposed PCG of up to $33.18 million issued by ADB in favor of IDB in respect of IDB\u2019s \nfinancing of Foundation Wind Energy II Limited for the Foundation Wind Energy II Project in \nPakistan.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECTS \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. As in many developing countries, an energy deficit is a major \nconstraint on efficient economic growth in Pakistan. To ensure a sustainable supply of energy, \nthe  Government  of  Pakistan  launched  a  number  of  initiatives  to  promote  private  sector \nparticipation in the country's energy infrastructure, including the power sector. As part of these \nefforts, a number of power policies were introduced, such as the Power Policy, 2002 and the \nRenewable Energy Policy, 2006. As of 30 September 2011, almost 40% of the country\u2019s power \ncapacity was owned and operated by international and national private sector investors. \n \n3.  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n4.  The sponsors initiated discussions with ADB to raise debt and equity financing for both \nprojects, attracted by ADB\u2019s strong presence and track record in Pakistan\u2019s power sector; it\u2019s \nsupport for Zorlu Enerji, the first wind project in Pakistan;1 and its strong and longstanding \nrelationship with the Fauji Foundation. The project team introduced the sponsors to the ADB\u2013\nIDB funded Islamic Infrastructure Fund to provide the balance of equity for the two transactions. \nAt the same time ADB initiated cofinancing discussions with IDB for the projects. ADB and IDB \nhave a close working relationship and have recently worked together on several transactions in \nPakistan:  New  Bong  Escape  Hydropower,2 Uch-II  Power,3 and  Patrind  Hydropower.4 The \npresence  of  ADB  in  the  transactions  helped  catalyze  local  currency  debt,  which  is  being \narranged by National Bank of Pakistan.  \n \n5.  The sponsors requested that all financing for the two projects be obtained in compliance \nwith Islamic Shariah principles. IDB and local banks are raising financing on this basis. To meet \nthe needs of the client, ADB will make innovative use of PCGs, allowing the project companies \nto raise all financing in line with Shariah. In the event the PCG structure is implemented, this will \nbe the first time ADB participates in a debt financing that is entirely compliant with Shariah.  \nShariah  financing,  though  new  to  ADB,  is  well  established  in  the  market  and  has  seen \ntremendous growth in recent years. In addition, ADB is familiar with Shariah structure as it has \ncofinanced several transactions in which IDB has provided a Shariah tranche alongside ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010.

IDB and ADB have also jointly established the Islamic Infrastructure \nFund in 2009 5.  \n \n6.  Project design. The two projects are located in the Gharo wind corridor 54 kilometers \nsoutheast of Karachi, Pakistan\u2019s industrial and commercial hub. The two project sites are only 6 \nkilometers apart and are being simultaneously developed to benefit from economies of scale. \nThe two projects will have the same set of engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) \ncontractors, financiers, and technical and legal advisors but are legally, economically, and \ncontractually distinct and will not rely on each other\u2019s cash flows. ADB will participate in two \ndistinct, stand-alone project financings \n \n7.  The two projects will encompass engineering, design, procurement, construction, turbine \nerection, grid tie-in, commissioning, and operation and maintenance (O&M) for two 50 MW wind \npower plants. The projects will be constructed under a date-certain, lump-sum, fixed-price EPC \ncontract. Power evacuation from both projects to the national grid will be through a 132-kilovolt \nline to be built and operated by the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC), the \nnational grid operator. Power offtake arrangements will be through a 20-year take-or-pay energy \npurchase agreement (EPA) signed by each project company and NTDC through its Central \nPower Purchasing Agency. The government will guarantee NTDC\u2019s obligations under the EPA \nas part of its obligations under a 20-year implementation agreement.  \n \n8.   CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impact. The successful development of the projects will help alleviate Pakistan\u2019s severe \npower shortage, which cramps the country\u2019s economic growth and efforts to reduce poverty. \nThe successful implementation of the projects will foster confidence among potential investors \nand lenders and promote further private sector investment in renewable energy and power in \nPakistan.  \n \n10.  Outcome. The outcome of the projects is the production of lower-cost, carbon-efficient \npower from wind energy. FWE I will generate annually 143.2 gigawatts (GWh) and FWE II will \ngenerate  annually  143.7  GWh  of  competitively  priced,  low-carbon  power  for  Pakistan\u2019s \nconsumers. The capacity factor of FWE I is expected to be 32.7% and of FWE II 32.8%. The \nprojects will incrementally increase access to energy for households, business, and industry. \nThe projected levelized tariff for FWE I and II is expected to be $0.15 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), \nwhich compares favorably with $0.19\u20130.23 per kWh, the incremental cost of furnace oil or \ndiesel-based power generation. The projects will avoid greenhouse gas emissions equal to \n68,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year for FWE I and 68,250 tons for FWE II and support the \ngovernment\u2019s target of generating 6% of power from renewable energy sources by 2030. By \nefficiently using an energy resource that is domestic, idle, and renewable, the projects will \ncontribute to Pakistan\u2019s energy security and the diversification of its skewed power mix, which \ncurrently relies heavily on expensive oil imports. Fossil fuels have experienced severe price \nescalation and volatility in recent years, which has undermined the financial health of the power \nsector and economy in general. Diversification using indigenous and renewable sources of \npower is an important avenue towards addressing the long-term financial health of the power \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2009.

This investment represented ADB\u2019s first Shariah compliant equity \nfinancing. \n ", "  3 \nsector and its circular debt problem.  \n \n11.  Outputs. The outputs will be the installing and commissioning of two 50 MW wind power \nprojects. The  projects will  create  local  employment  in  southern  Sindh,  one  of the  poorest \nregions in Pakistan.  \n  \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n12.  Consistency with  Strategy  2020. The projects are consistent with Strategy 2020,6 \nwhich emphasizes infrastructure investment to achieve rapid but sustainable economic growth \nand to connect the poor to markets and improve their access to basic productive assets as part \nof ADB\u2019s support for achieving inclusive growth. The projects will (i) promote private sector \ndevelopment  and  catalyze  private  sector  operations  and  (ii)  leverage  partnerships  through \ncofinancing with IDB, which are among the five drivers of change addressed by Strategy 2020.  \n \n13.  Consistency with country strategy. ADB\u2019s support for the projects is in line with its \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  Pakistan,  2009\u20132013,7 which  emphasizes  energy  sector \ndevelopment, private sector participation in infrastructure development, and the expansion of \nADB\u2019s private sector operations in the energy sector. Both projects are logical continuations of \nADB\u2019s development and reform efforts in Pakistan\u2019s energy sector, which promote a well-\nregulated, market-oriented power industry.  \n \n14.  Consistency with energy policy. The projects promote renewable energy, which is one \nof the three pillars of ADB\u2019s Energy Policy.8 ADB finances renewable energy projects to facilitate \nthe wider deployment of clean energy technologies and has set the target of promoting clean \nenergy investments of more than $1 billion annually, to which ADB support to the projects will \ncontribute. The projects will foster reduced fossil fuel use and contribute to the country\u2019s energy \nsecurity by using indigenous wind resources.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \nD.  Projected Economic Performance \n15.  The projects are economically sustainable, as the economic internal rates of return are \n12.42% for FWE I and 12.41% for FWE II, higher than the social discount rate of 10%.9 \nSensitivity analysis shows the projects are economically viable under adverse scenarios. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s assistance will be in the form of a PCG of up to $33.43 million for FWE I and a \nPCG of up to $33.18 million for FWE II issued by ADB. in favor of IDB. IDB will finance the \nprojects based on ijarah (a Shariah-compliant financing structure similar to lease financing). \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n7  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2009\u20132013. Manila. \n8  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n9  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The Evaluation Cooperation \nGroup\u2019s Good Practice Standards for Private Sector Investment Operations rates a project satisfactory if the \neconomic internal rate of return is 10% or higher.  \n ", "4   \nBroadly, under ijarah IDB will advance money to each project company during construction for \ndeveloping and procuring certain project assets. During operations, each project company will \npay rent to IDB for the use of those assets, the amount to be equivalent to principal plus interest \npayments under a conventional loan. ADB\u2019s PCG will cover any nonpayment by the project \ncompany to IDB, which includes initial disbursements by IDB, plus rental payments and other \nadditional associated costs. ADB\u2019s PCG will cover half of the amount of IDB\u2019s financing to the \nproject company. On the balance amount, IDB will take full project risk. Both PCGs will have a \ntenor of 12 years and match the tenor of IDB financing. \n \n17.  In  the  event  the  PCG  structure  cannot  be  implemented  due  to  lack  of  regulatory \napprovals,  lack  of  final  legal  documentation  acceptable  to  ADB,  or  other  reasons,  ADB\u2019s \nassistance will be in the form of a direct loan of up to $33.43 million for FWE I and a direct loan \nof up to $33.18 million for FWE II. Both loans will have a tenor of 12 years with a grace period of \n2 years. The proceeds of the PCG-guaranteed financing or the loans will fund the construction \nand development of the two projects. ADB\u2019s assistance to both projects will be from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources without government guarantee. ADB\u2019s PCGs will carry guarantee \nfees, and ADB\u2019s loans will carry interest and other fees and terms to be determined by ADB\u2019s \ninvestment committee.  \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n18.  ADB assistance adds value in the following ways:  \n(i)  ADB provides financing to critical assets in a sector that does not readily have \naccess to long-term funding under the present financial and country environment. \nADB\u2019s assistance to the  projects will increase the supply of energy, stem a \ngrowing  power  deficit  that  has  seriously  constrained  economic  growth,  and \nexpand access to energy for households, business, and industry. \n(ii)  The  presence  of  ADB  reassures  the  sponsors  that  government  entities  will \ncontinue to support the projects throughout their life. ADB was the first financial \ninstitution that the sponsors approached to finance the projects because of its \ntrack record in the country and the sector and the value the sponsors placed on \nthe risk-mitigation and financial-catalyst role that ADB has played in supporting \nprivate sector projects in Pakistan. \n(iii)  As part of its public sector program, ADB has a strong energy focus in Pakistan. \nIts work on reform and regulations has supported the creation of an enabling \nenvironment for current and future private and public sector investment. ADB is \nthe largest provider of renewable energy assistance to the country under its \nRenewable Energy Development Sector Investment Program.10 Support to the \nprojects  will  directly  build  on  and  complement  extensive  work  under  the \ninvestment program in promoting renewable energy in Pakistan. \n(iv)  The  proposed  PCG  structure  allows  ADB  to  participate  in  a  fully  Shariah-\ncompliant financing structure, which would not have been possible if ADB merely \nprovided  a  loan.  This  allows  ADB  to  be  more  responsive  to  borrower \nrequirements  and  provides  potential  for  expanding  financing  opportunities  in \ndeveloping member countries. The proposed PCG structure has been made \npossible  because  of  close  cooperation  between  ADB  and  IDB.  This  will \nstrengthen ADB\u2019s relationship with IDB, which is one of its key development \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "  5 \npartners. The proposed PCG structure also takes ADB\u2019s engagement in Islamic \nFinance for project financing to a new level; from observer to participant. ADB\u2019s \ncontinuing participation in the Shariah compliant financing structures will also \nenhance its continuing dialogue with key players in Islamic Finance. \n \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguard and Social Dimensions  \n19.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is environment \ncategory  B,  involuntary  resettlement  category C,  and  indigenous  peoples  category  C. The \nenvironmental assessment was carried out in line with national laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The Environmental Protection Agency of the Government of Sindh \nhas issued the necessary environmental permits for the projects. The project sites and their \nimmediate environs do not support natural vegetation of any ecological significance. The sites \ndo not provide habitat to any terrestrial, avian, or aquatic faunal species, nor are they located \nalong the route of migratory birds. No settlement exists at the proposed sites or their immediate \nvicinities, nor is any economic activity such as cultivation carried out there. During operation, \nlocal communities will not be affected as they are located several kilometers away from the \nproject sites. The potential environmental and social impacts and risks of the project have been \nidentified, and effective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for adverse \nimpacts  are  incorporated  in  environmental  management  plans.  A  dedicated  environment, \nhealth, and safety officer will be appointed in FWE I and FWE II to manage the projects\u2019 social \nand environmental health and safety risks and will be supported by appropriate budget for \nmitigation measures.11 The borrowers will be required to comply with ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy12 and report to ADB on their compliance and the compliance of contractors with core \nlabor standards.13 Information disclosure and consultations with affected people are conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n20.  The borrowers have been advised of ADB\u2019s standardized approach to anticorruption and \nits  policy  of  implementing  best  international  practice  relating  to  the  combating  of  money \nlaundering  and  the financing  of terrorism.  ADB  will  ensure  that  the  project  documentation \nincludes  appropriate  anticorruption  provisions  and  remedies  for  ADB  in  the  event  of \nnoncompliance. \n \n                                                \n11  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy; Safeguards and Social Dimensions Summary (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n12  ADB. 2003.
