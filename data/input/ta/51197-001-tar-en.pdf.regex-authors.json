INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  strengthen  reforms  in \nUzbekistan\u2019s urban water supply and sanitation (WSS). It will help the government formulate \ncomponents  of  a  medium-term  national  urban  WSS  sector  development  strategy,  build \ninstitutional capacity in the national WSS training center, formulate and deliver priority training \nmodules for the center, and improve and refine WSS regulations. The TA is consistent with the \ncountry partnership strategy but is not included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u2013\n2020 for Uzbekistan.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Challenge. Uzbekistan is one of the most important economies of the Belt and Road \nInitiative in Central Asia.2 Historically, the WSS sector has suffered from a combination of \ninsufficient investment and an inadequate policy framework. Acute funding constraints for capital \ninvestments and poor operations and maintenance have led to poor service, including high losses \nfrom leaks, frequent breakdowns, and excessive repair costs. Institutional arrangements are \ncharacterized by (i) fragmented and dysfunctional regulatory and institutional frameworks, (ii) \nrestricted sector planning capabilities, (iii) ineffective regulatory compliance mechanisms, and (iv) \nweak interagency coordination and oversight. Independent WSS utilities, known as vodokanals, \ndid not have the operational capacity or sufficient compensation to deliver adequate WSS \nservices. This has (i) undermined consumer confidence and their willingness to pay; and (ii) \nincreased regulator\u2019s reluctance to raise tariffs, further constraining financial and institutional \nperformance. \n \n3.  Current intervention. Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has invested \nmore than $500 million in the rehabilitation and expansion of Uzbekistan\u2019s WSS infrastructure. \nMore than 5 million residents have benefited from this assistance through safer and more reliable \nWSS services. To address the government\u2019s institutional shortcomings, ADB has assisted in the \ndevelopment  of  a  phased,  nationwide  reform  program,  including  the  reorganization  and \nconsolidation of WSS sector institutions, and implementation of sector-wide reforms.  \n \n4.  Phase  1  of  the  reform  program,  which  focused  on  institutional  consolidation,  was \nimplemented  under  the  ADB-financed  Uzbekistan  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Services \nInvestment Program in 2009\u20132018. In 2015, the Government of Uzbekistan enacted the Decree \nof the Cabinet of Ministers (DCM) 3063 to establish regional WSS utilities, known as suvokovas, \nin each province. Vodokanals were restructured and absorbed as branches of their respective \nprovincial suvokovas. Suvokovas are also mandated to implement more than 40 corporate \ngovernance improvements to strengthen utility capacity.4 Phase 2, which is ongoing, aims to \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 December 2017. The TA is a \ncontinuation of the strategy as defined by the Urban WSS sector development and investment strategy study and \nsupported by ADB.  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Uzbekistan, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n2  The Belt and Road Initiative, also known as the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-century Maritime Silk Road, \nis an initiative advocated by the People\u2019s Republic of China and joined by others to improve connectivity and \neconomic cooperation. \n3  The Cabinet of Ministers enacted DCM 306, entitled \u201cOn measures to implement the main directions of development \nof the organizations of water supply and sanitation,\u201d on 30 October 2015. \n4  The corporate governance requirements include (i) conducting an inventory of assets and consumers; (ii) instituting \ntransparent  billing  systems;  (iii)  strengthening  fiscal  controls  and  accountability;  (iv)  adopting  a  geographic \ninformation system for asset management; (v) strengthening customer grievances redress systems; (vi) introducing \nperformance reporting; (vii) reviewing and approving business plans; and (viii) implementing public information \ncampaigns, training, and other measures. \n ", "2 \noverhaul of the WSS institutional framework. The Agency Kommunhizmat (CSA) under the \nMinistry of Housing and Communal Services (MHCS) is expected to (i) unify government policy \non WSS, (ii) manage interdepartmental coordination in WSS, and (iii) implement WSS projects \nfinanced by international financing institutions. The State Unitary Enterprise Educational and \nMethodological Center Kommunalukuv has also been transitioned under MHCS into the main \ntraining center to build human resource capacity, facilitate the formulation and refinement of \nlegislation, and undertake public awareness activities.5 \n \n5.  Critical path. Although the WSS sector reform has made substantial progress, three key \ninitiatives have been identified as being critical to the ongoing reform process: (i) formulation of a \nmedium-term WSS sector development strategy to guide sector development from 2019\u20132028, \n(ii)  targeted  training  and  support  to  build  the  institutional  and  operational  capacity  of \nKommunalukuv, and (iii) refinement of DCM 306 and other regulations based on recent sector \nfindings and emerging developments.   \n \n6.  The TA will help CSA develop and implement all three initiatives. The TA is consistent with \nand  supports  the  country  partnership  strategy  for  Uzbekistan,  2012\u201320166 by  (i)  building \ninstitutional and management capacity in WSS utilities to enhance their corporate practices, and \n(ii) improving cost recovery and strengthening accountability. The TA also supports ADB\u2019s \nongoing WSS sector program, as outlined in the country operations business plan for Uzbekistan, \n2018\u20132020.7   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: urban WSS services improved. The TA will \nhave the following outcome: Urban WSS strategy and institutional capacity enhanced.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  The TA outputs will support the government\u2019s sector reforms by assisting in formulating a \nmedium-term WSS sector development strategy, strengthening the capacity of Kommunalukuv, \nand updating and refining existing WSS sector regulations.  The TA will build upon (i) ADB\u2019s sector \nknowledge and experience, particularly its engagement in recent WSS reforms; (ii) international \nbest practice in modern utility planning, management, and operations; and (iii) longer-term \ninternational twinning opportunities to provide continuity in knowledge transfer, learning, and \ncapacity strengthening. TA activities will be closely aligned with and support ongoing and planned \nADB investments in the WSS sector, which will benefit from the TA\u2019s focus on institutional capacity \nbuilding and training. \n \n9.  Output 1: Medium-term urban water supply and sanitation sector development and \ninvestment strategy prepared. Output 1 has three key components: (i) drinking water resource \n                                                \n5  Before  the  recent  reforms,  the  training  center  Kommunalukuv  was  known  as  the  Republican  Educational\u2013\nMethodological  and  Legal\u2013Engineering  Center  Uzkommunukuvtashkilotchi,  which  reported  to  Agency \nUzkommunhizmat, which has been transitioned under the MHCS into the CSA. \n6  ADB. 2012.
