The Government of India (the Government) and the government of the state of Assam \n(GoA)  have  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  provide  advisory  technical \nassistance (TA) to the GoA Finance Department to strengthen the state government\u2019s budgeting \nand planning processes and improve the state\u2019s expenditure management. An ADB Mission \nvisited Guwahati, the state capital, and Delhi from 3 to 12 March 2003, to undertake fact-finding \nfor the TA. The Mission and representatives from the GoA Finance Department and the central \ngovernment\u2019s Ministry of Finance held discussions, and reached an understanding on the \nobjective, scope, cost, and implementation arrangements of the TA. Assam is an ADB focal \nstate, and the TA is included in ADB\u2019s India Country Strategy and Program 2003-2006.1 \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The state of Assam is the gateway to India\u2019s northeastern states. Situated between other \nnortheastern states, and the plain regions of Bihar, eastern Uttar Pradesh, and parts of West \nBengal  and  Orissa,  Assam  shares  the  problems  of  both  neighboring  areas.  With  other \nnortheastern states, it shares the physical constraints and high transportation costs associated \nwith a remote hilly terrain. With its neighboring states of the plain region, it shares a high \nincidence of poverty, problems associated with high population density, an economy heavily \ndependent on agriculture, and a limited industrial base. Insurgency in the 1990s, while now \nebbing out, has deterred investment and economic growth.  \n \n3.  Assam, with a population of 26.6 million and a population density of 340 persons per \nsquare kilometer, is the largest and most densely populated state among the special category \nstates in India. In addition, with 36% of the population below the poverty line (1999-2000) and \nan average per capita gross state domestic product (GSDP) of Rs7,968 (1994/95-1996/97), it is \namong the poorest. The poverty ratio for both the urban and rural areas and some core human \ndevelopment indicators such as total fertility rate, infant mortality rate, and literacy rate, have \nvisibly improved over recent decades. The table shows the improvement achieved in Assam, \nrelative to national trends. \nHuman Development Indicators (%) \nIndicator  1975  1980  1985  1990  1995  1997  Latest \na\nYear  \n               \nAssam \nTotal Fertility Rate   4.1  4.0  4.1  3.4  2.2  -  2.3 b \nInfant Mortality Rate  144  103  111  76  76  76  78 c \nLiteracy Rate  -  -  -  53  -  75  - \nAll India               \nTotal Fertility Rate   4.9  4.4  4.3  3.8  3.5  -  2.9b \nInfant Mortality Rate  140  114  97  80  74  71  68b \nLiteracy Rate  -  44  -  52  59  62  64c \n               \n \na Source: India CSP 2003-2006, GoI Economic Survey 2002-03, and National Family Health Survey. \n  b\n1999. \n  c 2001. \n  Source: World Bank. 2000.

", "2 \n \n \n4.  Assam\u2019s economic growth rate for 1990s was 2.5%, about 4 percentage points below \nthe national gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate for the same period. Assam\u2019s main \nnatural resources are water, forests, and minerals. However, with the implementation of the \nForestry Conservancy Act in 1980, forests have ceased to be an effective revenue resource. \nMoreover, revenue from mineral resources continues to be subject to central control, and to \ndate water as a source for hydro energy has yet to be developed to any substantive degree. \nAssam\u2019s industry sector accounts for only 18% of total GSDP (1999/2000) and is narrowly \nfocused on petroleum, tea, and forest products. Agriculture, the second largest sector, accounts \nfor 37% of total GSDP. Assam\u2019s service sector, comprising hotels and restaurants, and public \nadministration, is the largest of the three sectors (at 45% of total GSDP, 1999/2000) and the \nfastest growing. Growth in the service sector, however, is due to a great extent to growth of \npublic administration. Public administration represents almost 8% of total GSDP (1999/2000), \nan increase of over 40% since the mid-1990s. However, the growth of public administration \nmasks declines in commercial services over the same period. \n  \n5.  Assam\u2019s state finances have steeply deteriorated since fiscal year (FY) 1998/99. Despite \nrecent  relaxations  in  overdraft  regulations,  Assam  continues  to  run  an  overdraft  with  the \nReserve Bank of India (RBI), and among states it currently has the highest number of days a \nyear  on  which  payments  are  suspended  by  the  state\u2019s  treasury.  Budget  estimates  for \nFY2001/02, indicate Assam\u2019s revenues comprised 32% of own revenues and 68% from central \ntransfers (of which 40% is the state share of central taxes and 60% is central plan assistance). \nTotal expenditure estimated for the same period indicates a 38% revenue deficit over estimated \nrevenue  receipts  for  the  year.  Revenue  expenditure  comprises  roughly  75%  wages,  15% \ninterest payments, and 7% pension payments. Revenue expenditure far exceeds the state\u2019s \nown revenue (both tax and nontax), and the state\u2019s share of central taxes. In fact, of the \napproximate 40% of the total state budget that is financed by central plan assistance for \ndevelopment, three fourths is applied to revenue expenditure and only one fourth is actually \nutilized for capital expenditure. Thus, despite the significantly improved tax buoyancy, Assam\u2019s \nfinancial situation continues to be problematic primarily because of the growth in government \nsalaries, pensions, and interest payments. \n \n6.  The  state\u2019s  fiscal  trends  raise  several  concerns  for  both  the  state  and  central \ngovernment. First, as the proportion of the state budget required for revenue expenditure \nincreases, the allocation available for state investment in social and infrastructure development \ndecreases. Second, the existing plan transfer regime, consisting of 90% grant and 10% loan,2 \nhas created an incentive to set plans larger than the state\u2019s implementation capacity without \ntaking into account the recurring cost implications of the projects or the state\u2019s financial capacity \nto sustain such investments. Third, the increasing reliance on loan-financed central assistance \nto fund the state\u2019s revenue expenditure raises critical liquidity and financial viability issues. \nRecognizing the serious fiscal crisis it faces, the state government entered into a Memorandum \nof Understanding (MOU) with the central government in January 2000, to undertake a program \nof fiscal reforms. In accordance with this agreement the central government provided medium-\nterm assistance totaling Rs3 billion to GoA, comprised of extended ways and means advances \nand market borrowings. Under the MOU, key fiscal reforms3 that have been implemented \ninclude revenue improvements such as the introduction of uniform floor rates for the sales tax; \n                                                 \n2  As a special category state, Assam is eligible to receive all central plan assistance in accordance with this transfer \nregime.  \n3  Srivastava, D.K. et al. 2000.

", "    3 \nand public expenditure rationalizations such as identification of 4,080 positions for abolition, and \nimplementation of a periodic review and revision of tariffs, and fees and user charges in the \npower sector, the irrigation and water supply sectors, and the tertiary education sector. \n \n7.  In  February  2002,  GoA  submitted  to  the  central  government\u2019s  State  Fiscal  Reform \nFacility a proposal for a Medium-Term Fiscal Reform Program (MTFRP). The proposal builds on \nthe previous program of reforms agreed to in the January 2000 MOU. The February 2002 \nproposal again outlines an ambitious program of fiscal reform that includes (i) restructuring and \nrightsizing of the public sector administration, and civil service pension reform; (ii) rationalization \nof government expenditure and subsidies, and improved cost recovery policies for tariffs, fees, \nand user charges in specified sectors; and (iii) improved public sector financial management \nand expenditure (as well as contingent liability) control.  \n \n8.  On 28 March 2003, an MOU outlining GoA\u2019s MTFRP was signed by GoA and the central \ngovernment. Recognizing the challenges ahead, GoA has requested TA support4 to strengthen \nits efforts in addressing the state\u2019s MTFRP. Support to strengthen policy analysis and improve \nmanagement information systems will enable GoA to implement better expenditure control and \nmanagement. Moreover, improved policy analysis will enable GoA to assess the degree that \nexisting financial priorities support the state\u2019s development objectives, as well as the fiscal \nviability and sustainability of policy choices ahead. These assessments will in turn enable the \nGoA to develop the practical rationales needed to engender sufficient political will to make and \nimplement the difficult policy choices required. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  TA  will  strengthen  GoA\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  MTFRP  by  supporting  (i) the \nestablishment of a legislative framework for improving the state\u2019s fiscal management and fiscal \nreporting; (ii) improvement of the state\u2019s planning and budgeting process; (iii) strengthening of \nthe GoA\u2019s expenditure management  and control; (iv) improvement of public sector service \ndelivery by supporting the preparation of a functional assessment of the state administration, \nand  the  development  and  evaluation  of  options  for  its  organizational  restructuring  and \nrightsizing; and (v) exploration and piloting of e-governance options for improving staff relations, \nand procurement and disbursement processes. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have five components:  \n \n(i)  Establishing a legislative framework for improving fiscal management. This \ncomponent  will  support  the  development  of  the  legislative  framework  for \nimproving the state\u2019s fiscal management and fiscal reporting.  \n \n(ii)  Improving public sector planning and budgeting. This component will support \nthe implementation of effective planning and budgeting practices that focus on \nenabling the state to better allocate resources, improve fiscal performance, and \nensure fiscal sustainability.  \n                                                 \n4  TA support may also be provided by the Australian Agency for International Development (AUSAID) and/or DFID. \nTA support will be coordinated to ensure potential synergies are explored and duplication of support is avoided.  ", "4 \n \n(iii)  Strengthening  public  sector  expenditure  management  and  control. This \ncomponent will support the implementation of efficient and effective procurement, \nand  treasury  and  payment  systems;  and  the  strengthening  of  financial \nmanagement and reporting systems to improve transparency and accountability.  \n \n(iv)  More effective public sector service delivery: The ability of GoA to address \nfiscal reform and improve equitable service delivery will be critically linked with \nthe pace at which civil service reform can be achieved\u2013given the substantive \nburden wages are on the state\u2019s finances. This component will  support the \ndevelopment of a strategy and action plan to implement civil service reforms and \nenable more effective use of human resources in government service.  \n \n(v)  E-Governance. This component will explore e-governance options to improve \nthe efficiency and effectiveness of public service delivery, improve transparency \nof processes, and facilitate ease and equality of access. Specific options to be \nexplored  include  establishing  an  electronic  database  of  personnel/employee \nrecords  for  access  to  staff  benefits  and/or  personnel  records;  establishing \nelectronic links with suppliers, if feasible, to improve the transparency, efficiency, \nand speed of procurement and payment; and establishing electronic links with \nbanks, again if feasible, to improve cash management, and the transparency, \nease of access, and speed of payments to suppliers, and, more importantly, \ngovernment employees and pensioners.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,262,000 equivalent, consisting of $558,000 in \nforeign exchange and $704,000 equivalent in local currency. The entire foreign exchange cost \nand $442,000 equivalent of the local currency cost amounting to $1,000,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom. GoA will finance the \nremaining local currency cost of $262,000 equivalent in kind, including provision of counterpart \nstaff (estimated at 264 person-months), office accommodation and office supplies, transport, \nand  workshop  venue  and  organizational  arrangements.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  GoA will establish a steering committee for TA coordination to review the inception \nreport, and periodically review the progress of the TA and resolve any issues that may arise. \nThe  committee  will  be  chaired  by  the  Finance  Department  and  will  include  the  following \ndepartments: (i) Finance Department, (ii) Planning and Development Department, and (iii) the \nAdministrative  Reforms  Department.  The  GoA  Finance  Department  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency for the TA. It will set up a working secretariat or TA implementing unit, appoint a \nmanager  for  the  secretariat/unit,  and  ensure  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nfurniture, and equipment, as required. The TA budget provides $150,000 equivalent for the \npurchase of computer equipment, to be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for \nProcurement, and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. \n \n13.  GoA will also establish a high-level apex committee, under the chairmanship of the chief \nsecretary, to review the terms of reference for the functional assessment; support and facilitate \nits implementation and resolve any issues that may arise; and review and approve the strategy, ", "    5 \ntime-bound action plan, and performance benchmarks for implementing the agreed-upon civil \nservice reforms. The high-level committee will include representatives from  the Office of the \nChief Secretary, Finance Department, Planning and Development Department, Administrative \nReforms Department, Personnel Department, and representation from key line departments (for \nexample, the Education and Health Departments, the Irrigation and Flood Departments, and the \nPublic Works Department).  \n \n14.  A consulting firm will be recruited to provide a team of international and domestic \nconsultants to execute the TA. ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. In \nselecting a consulting firm, the quality and cost-based selection method with the simplified \ntechnical proposal will be used. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Approximately \n21 person-months of international and 55 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired  over  13  months.  The  consultants  must  have  experience  in  developing  and \nimplementing fiscal reform programs, macroeconomic forecasting, government budgeting and \nplanning  processes,  government  treasury  and  procurement  processes,  public  expenditure \nmanagement and control, civil service reform, and use of information technology to support e-\ngovernance.  \n \n15.  The TA will be completed in about 13 months, from September 2003 to November 2004. \nAn inception report outlining the consultant\u2019s approach and methodology will be prepared within \n3 weeks of the start of the TA and will be reviewed at a tripartite meeting to be attended by \nrepresentatives of the central and Assam state governments, ADB, and the TA consultants. \nProgress reports will be prepared quarterly, and a draft final report will be prepared 11 months \nafter the start of the work. Both the mid-term progress report and the draft final report will be \nreviewed at tripartite meetings, with the final report to be submitted within 1 month following the \ntripartite meeting.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom \nfor Budget Procedure Reform, Computerization, and Expenditure Management (Assam), and \nhereby reports this action to
