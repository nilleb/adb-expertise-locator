INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) is a six-country1 program of regional cooperation to \nsustainably manage coastal and marine resources in the region of the \u201ccoral triangle\u201d. The coral \ntriangle is an expanse of ocean covering 5.7 million square kilometers and is considered as the \nepicenter of marine life abundance and diversity on the planet. Following the first CTI senior \nofficials meeting in Bali in December 2007, Indonesian President Yudhoyono requested that the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide  technical  and  financial  assistance  to  support  the \npreparation of CTI plans of action (POAs) and serve as the lead agency for CTI to access \nresources  from  the  Global  Environment  Facility  (GEF).  This  regional  policy  and  advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA)2 is a direct response by ADB to the request by the President of \nIndonesia. \n \n2.  A  GEF  project  preparation  grant  was  awarded  to  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme (UNDP) and ADB to prepare a project\u2014Portfolio Learning in International Waters \nwith a Focus on Oceans, Coasts, and Islands and Regional Asia/Pacific and Coral Triangle \nLearning Processes3\u2014under GEF\u2019s International Waters Learning Exchange and Resource \nNetwork (IW:LEARN). The project will have four components:4 (i) advancing the global agenda \non oceans, coasts, and small island developing states; (ii) GEF International Waters Portfolio \nlearning; (iii) regional cooperation on knowledge management, policy, and institutional support \nto the CTI; and (iv) project coordination and management. This TA will comprise component 3 of \nthe project. \n \n3.  This TA provides a unique and high-profile opportunity to promote regional cooperation \namong the six core Southeast Asian and Pacific countries of the coral triangle (CT6) and \nresponds to ADB\u2019s regional integration and cooperation strategy,5 under its fourth pillar on \nregional public goods. The TA aims to strengthen regional policy dialogue and coordination \namong national governments and regional entities, in relation to cross-border issues directly \naffecting the sustainability of the subregion\u2019s economy, its environment, and measures for good \ngovernance in the use and management of the natural resources of the CTI. \n \n4.  This TA is closely aligned with the archipelagic Southeast Asia regional cooperation \nstrategy and program (2009\u20132012) and the following technical assistance (TA) projects, which \nhave recently been approved or have been proposed for consideration: (i) Regional Review of \nthe Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia;6 (ii) Regional Connectivity in Infrastructure \nin Archipelagic Southeast Asia;7 (iii) Strengthening Coastal and Marine Resources Management \nin  the  CTI  of  the  Pacific  phase  1;8  (iv)  Strengthening  Coastal  and  Marine  Resources \nManagement  in  the  CTI  Southeast  Asia  (Concept  Paper);  (v)  Strengthening  Sound \nEnvironmental Management in the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines \n                                                 \n1  Includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor Leste. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 April 2009. \n3  See http://www.iwlearn.net/iw-projects/iwproject.2008-04-04.8053605430/project_doc/pif-document \n4  Components 1, 2, and 4 are managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and will run in \ntandem with this TA. \n5  ADB. 2006.

In addition, the TA will utilize lessons from a wide range of existing cooperative marine \nand coastal resource management projects undertaken by ADB.10 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  From the outset, key CTI stakeholders, including ADB, have recognized that additional \nsupport on knowledge management, shared learning, institutional strengthening, and policy \nsupport will be needed to ensure that the goals of the CTI POAs are achieved. Some key issues \nconcerning knowledge management, policies, and institutional support are detailed below. \n \nA.  Scientific and Technical Knowledge Management \n \n7.  Accessibility of Information. The CTI is underpinned by a science-based approach, \nbut  the  draft  regional  plan  of  action  (RPOA),  which  details  the  planned  activities  to  be \nundertaken, fails to specify the critical role of research in the program or how to bring the \nscientific community fully into the CTI. There is a need to harmonize databases across the CT6, \nwith  standardized  indicators,  methodology  and  units  of  measure.  Additionally,  addressing \ninformation gaps would require tracking and organizing scientific and technical information such \nthat critical information becomes available and useful to local communities and concerned \nstakeholders as part of the available tools for the effective management and efficient utilization \nof coastal and marine resources. \n \n8.  Knowledge Management. Implementation of the RPOA will require the use of best-\navailable  global  information  on  practices  pertaining  to  each  program  component.  The \nsubsequent implementation of action plans at the national and local levels is expected to \ngenerate a large amount of information from research and lessons from innovative practices \nand schemes on adaptive management, sustainable financing, and governance challenges. \nThis body of knowledge constitutes a major CTI output, which needs to be organized and made \naccessible to various stakeholders in order to facilitate cross-fertilization of relevant efforts and \ninform policy decisions on good governance and effective management. The CTI program \nintegration portal, funded by the United States Agency for International Development, needs to \nbe transferred to the CTI secretariat and national focal points, and maintained after United \nStates Agency for International Development funding ceases. \n \nB.  Institutional Development and Financing Mechanisms \n \n9.  Coral Triangle Initiative Regional Secretariat. The current interim CTI secretariat is \nhosted by the Government of Indonesia, and has developed a road map culminating in a CTI \nLeaders Summit on 15 May 2009. The CTI Summit brought together leaders from the CT6 to \nendorse the CTI Regional Plan of Action, which sets out a framework of regional cooperation \nand  national  interventions  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  their  shared  coastal  and  marine \nresources. Little attention has been given to future CTI program coordination and management, \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Sound Environmental Management in the Brunei Darussalam, \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area.  Manila  (TA  6446-REG  for  $1.700  million, \napproved on 7 March). \n10  These  include  the  Sulu\u2013Sulawesi  Marine  Ecoregion  of  the  Coral  Triangle;  Coral  Reef  Rehabilitation  and \nManagement in Indonesia (phases I and II); and the Integrated Coastal Resources Management Project in the \nPhilippines. \n ", "      3\nhowever,  or  to  the  associated  evolution  and  funding  of  the  secretariat  beyond  that  point. \nThrough its coordination and resource mobilization roles, ADB and other partners will need to \nassist  the  interim  CTI  secretariat  to  evaluate  the  options  for  the  longer-term  institutional \ndevelopment of the CTI secretariat. For example, the functional role played by the program \nintegrator (currently funded by the Government of the United States) will eventually be handed \nover to the CTI regional secretariat. ADB will need to work closely with the current program \nintegrator in monitoring and strengthening the capability of the CTI secretariat to ensure it can \nassume the program integrator role after the handover process. \n \n10.  Sustainable Financing.  A specific challenge is to determine current levels of public \nand private expenditure on the management of coastal and marine resources within the CT6 to \nenable identification of potential resource gaps and sustainable financing options to address \nthem. In addition, a financial architecture for coordinating and administering funds from a variety \nof development partners is currently absent. ADB could assist by developing a budget process \nfor the CTI as part of the financial and/or resource mobilization and monitoring design in order to \nensure sustainable financing and efficient utilization of funds. \n \nC.  Strategic Planning and Policy \n \n11.  Implementation of the Plan of Action.  Progress has been noted in the development of \ncomplementary CTI national plans of action (NPOAs), although some of the CT6 are lagging \nbehind in the development of their plans. To achieve the targets set forth in the RPOA, these \nnational initiatives need NPOAs to be properly implemented, coordinated, and timed, and need \nto be more effectively integrated into global policy and governance developments. Experience \nfrom other GEF integrated waters projects will be shared at the Fifth Biennial GEF International \nWaters Conference, and may prove valuable for CTI stakeholders. \n \n12.  Policy Development.  ADB\u2019s ongoing policy dialogue with the CT6 should be adjusted \nto adopt specific commitments in the RPOA as a primary area for ADB support, along with \nADB\u2019s existing coordination and resource mobilization role. Global best practices in relation to \neconomic, policy, and legal reforms need to be linked to the CTI through Fifth Biennial GEF \nInternational Waters Conference and related portfolio learning, and raised in global governance \ndialogues through the Global Forum on Oceans, Coasts, and Islands. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA will strengthen the management of coastal and marine ecosystems in the coral \ntriangle in a more coordinated and sustainable manner. Regional cooperation among the CT6 \non information exchange and decision making based on scientific and technical knowledge and \nglobal best practices will be strengthened. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Outputs \n \n14.  A detailed program for the proposed implementation period of 30 months, commencing \nAugust  2009,  will  be  prepared  within  the  first  6  months.  The  TA  will  adopt  the  following \nstrategies: it will (i) make available research-based information to help define options and \ndecisions  for  sustainable  resource  management;  (ii)  engage  multisector  and  multilevel \nstakeholder participation and information sharing for broad-based program ownership and wider \n ", "4   \nsupport;  (iii)  build  on  existing  policies,  plans,  intercountry  agreements,  institutional \narrangements, and accomplishments to consolidate the gains and accelerate progress in the \nCTI region; (iv) secure the required long-term commitment from stakeholders and donors to \nsustain the program results in a large and complex implementation setting; and (v) consider the \ninteraction of factors shaping common threats and opportunities for environmental protection to \ngenerate a coordinated and synergistic response for the subregion. \n \n15.  The four main outputs of the TA will be: (i) strengthened CTI regional cooperation, (ii) \nestablishment of regional learning mechanisms, (iii) implementation of a communication and \ninformation dissemination plan, and (iv) establishment of sustainable financing schemes. \n \n16.  Output  1:  Strengthened  Coral  Triangle  Initiative  Regional  Cooperation.  An \nexpected output from this TA is strengthened capacity of the CT6 to (i) improve coordination \nand communication on regional issues and concerns, and (ii) effectively work together in a \nprogram  of  regional  cooperation  to  ensure  the  long-term  conservation  and  sustainable \nmanagement of coastal and marine resources in the coral triangle. Guided by the CTI national \ncoordination committees (NCCs), the CTI regional secretariat, and relevant CTI working groups, \nthe TA will support capacity building, regional coordination and communications relating to the \nimplementation  of  CTI  POA  priorities  through  policy  dialogues,  thematic  workshops  and \nconsultations, publications and website enhancements, and targeted studies. \n \n17.  Output 2: Established Regional Learning Mechanisms. Institutional capacity in the \nsectoral  and  cross-cutting  agencies  involved  in  coastal  and  marine  activities  in  the  CTI \ncountries, coordinated through the NCCs, will be developed at the national and regional levels \nthrough  information  exchange,  regional  meetings  of  participating  countries,  and  technical \nworkshops. Priorities identified by the CT6 were verified during the fact-finding in March 2009,11 \nand include (i) identification of information needs and gaps; (ii) translation of existing information \ninto more useable forms and utilization of this information in decision-making processes; (iii) \ncollection  of  new  data,  from  planning  to  implementation;  (iv)  improved  management  of \ninformation, data, and knowledge; and (v) building of scientific and \u201cscience-to-action\u201d capacity. \nTo ensure a link between national CTI POAs and scientific information, emphasis will be placed \non building the capacity of national staff responsible for coordination. \n \n18.  Output 3: Implemented Communication and Information Dissemination Plan. A \ncommunications strategy will be prepared with the CT6 and development partners. This strategy \nwill detail the mechanisms for inter-project exchange and sharing of results. It will also prescribe \ntargeted  learning  processes  that  build  on  synergies  and  partnerships  of  participating \ngovernments  and  organizations.  Online  communities  of  practice  will  be  established  and \nincorporate substantive user-driven information, with access to global and regional technical \nand scientific resources (tied to and building on IW:LEARN experience to date). Working group \nreports (established under CTI POAs at the national and regional levels) will be published and \nwidely disseminated. Technical support provided to NCCs, the CTI secretariat, and working \ngroups  will  facilitate  the  production  of  the  state  of  the  coral  triangle  report.  Appropriate \ncommunications materials on the CTI will be developed and widely disseminated throughout the \nCTI communities of practice. Emphasis will be placed on ensuring the disseminated information \nfeeds directly into decision-making processes. The lack of internet access in some of the CTI \ncountries, especially at the local government level, will also be addressed. \n \n                                                 \n11 Decision Support and Knowledge Management System Workshop held in Manila in March 2009. \n ", "      5\n19.  Output 4: Established Sustainable Financing Schemes for Plans of Action. Working \nwith the CTI financial mechanisms working group, the TA will explore innovative and sustainable \nfinancing mechanisms and seek pledges of commitment among the CT6 and their partners to \nimplement regional POA activities in relation to improved strategic planning, communication, \nand capacity strengthening. ADB will also assist the CT6 in developing a financial resources \noperational  strategy  for  implementing  NPOAs.  This  will  involve:  (i)  identifying  national  CTI \nbudget flows, development partner contributions and potential resource gaps; (ii) assessing \ninnovative and sustainable financing options, including payments for environmental services; (iii) \nidentifying financial architecture options for coordinating and administering funds from a variety \nof development partners; and (iv) developing a budget process for the CTI as part of financial \nand resource mobilization and monitoring systems. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2.3 million, $500,000 of which will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the ADB Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  $1,200,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the GEF Fund through a project preparation grant.12 The TA will be \nadministered by ADB. The remaining $600,000 will be contributed by the governments of the \nCT6 through in-kind counterpart support services, and each country will finalize its contribution \nbefore TA implementation. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will serve as the Executing Agency for the TA and will \nwork closely with the ADB CTI task force in the management of the TA.13 The lead environment \nagencies in each CT6 country will serve as the counterpart implementing agencies. To ensure \nwhole-of-government engagement and coordination, the CTI NCCs in each CT6 will also be \nutilized. At a regional level, ADB will consult and coordinate with the CTI regional secretariat. \nAny specific activity funded by this TA will start in a particular member country only after ADB \nhas received a no-objection letter from that country\u2019s government. \n \n22.  To enhance regional learning and take advantage of global synergies and links with \nrelated initiatives, the project will take a proactive approach to coordination, collaboration and \ninformation sharing with: (i) CTI projects and activities supported by other development partners \nand the GEF; (ii) related projects and activities under the GEF International Waters Focal Area \nand the IW:LEARN portfolio; and (iii) related regional and global initiatives and programs such \nas Coordinating Body on the Seas of East Asia, Partnerships in Environmental Management for \nthe Seas of East Asia, and the Global Forum on Oceans, Coasts, and Islands. \n \n23.  As one of the executing agencies of the GEF grant for the project, ADB will coordinate \nwith UNDP, the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS), and the UNDP Project \nCoordination  Unit  regarding  the  implementation  of  the  project  and  linkages  between \ncomponents 1 and 4. Roles and responsibilities for reporting to the GEF secretariat regarding \nproject progress, financial disbursement, and monitoring and evaluation will be established \n                                                 \n12 Application for cofinancing ($1,200,000) for project implementation was made to the GEF on 29 February 2008 and \napproved by the GEF Council on 24 April 2008. \n13 Three departments within ADB coordinate and discuss matters relating to the CTI: the Pacific Department, the \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department, and the Southeast Asia Department. \n ", "6   \nthrough a memorandum of understanding and/or coordination agreement between ADB and \nUNDP at project commencement. \n \n24.  The TA will require 30 person-months of international consulting and 82 person-months \nof national consulting services. Consultants will be recruited through a firm using quality- and \ncost-based selection (80:20), using a simplified technical proposal. International and national \nconsultants will be selected and hired by ADB, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3, and a proposed organizational structure for implementation is in \nAppendix 4. Information on the coordination of the CTI at the regional, subregional, and national \nlevels is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. \n \n25.  ADB will select a suitably qualified nongovernment organization to conduct a series of \ntraining workshops and learning events using quality- and cost-based selection. All procurement \nand disbursements under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  and  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook.14  Upon  TA \ncompletion, all equipment purchased will be provided to the participating CT6 governments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n26.  The President acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Global Environment Facility, and (ii) ADB administering a \nportion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation \nand  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  the  Regional  Cooperation  on  Knowledge \nManagement,  Policy,  and  Institutional  Support  to  the  Coral  Triangle  Initiative,  and  hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2008.
