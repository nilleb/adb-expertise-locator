During a Country Programming Mission in March 2006, the Government of Bhutan (the \nGovernment) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide an additional technical \nassistance  (TA)  grant  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  the  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt \nManagement (DADM). A previous grant1 had been approved in 2004. The request reflected the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to integrate the analysis of debt sustainability into medium- and long-term \nmacroeconomic planning and to promote good governance. The current TA2 was included in \nADB's 2006 country operations business plan.3\n \n2.   The mission visited Bhutan on 6\u20137 July 2006, and met with senior officials and technical \nstaff from the DADM of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The Government and the mission \nreached an understanding on the objectives, scope, financing plan, and implementation details \nof the TA. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   One of the main objectives of the Government\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan (2002\u20132007) was \nto  focus  on  good  governance  by  strengthening  public  administration  through  increased \nefficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. In the field of public finances, the Government has \nintroduced  a  number  of  measures  to  ensure  effective  resource  management.  It  has \nstrengthened the capacity of the DADM by building a strategic and operational framework for \ndebt  management,  supported  by  appropriate  information  technology  systems.  Given  the \ncountry\u2019s growing debt portfolio and a shift to less concessional funding, there is a need to \nstrengthen Bhutan\u2019s public debt management. The overall budget deficit grew by about 90% \nduring financial year (FY) 2005, increasing the deficit to GDP ratio from 7% to 11%. Growth in \ndomestic revenue halved to 14%. Growth in grants was only 13% (compared with 96% in \nFY2004). As per budget estimates, 65% of the overall deficit was financed through domestic \nborrowings and the rest through external borrowings. By the end of FY2005, Bhutan\u2019s external \ndebt had grown by 14.7% and amounted to $606.8 million.  \n \n4.  Given the scale of the task, additional assistance was needed to support the reform \nagenda.    At  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB  responded  with  two  advisory  TA  projects  to \nstrengthen Bhutan\u2019s debt management capacity.  The first was approved in July 2002 and \nimplemented in the first quarter of 2003,4 while the second was approved in September 2004 \nand implemented in the fourth quarter of 2004 (footnote 1).  \n \n5.   Under  the  first  of  these  TA  projects,  a  regulatory,  institutional,  and  operational \nassessment of DADM was conducted, in order to build a strategic framework to enable DADM \nto enhance the process of debt management and recording. Modifications to the External \nResources Management System (ERMS), the original database used by DADM to monitor the \ndebt portfolio, were suggested. The ERMS is generated and managed using Excel and Access \nsoftware.  The second TA project built on the findings and outputs of the first by (i) drafting a \ndebt policy in accordance with the strategic development plan for the economy; (ii) developing a \nloan  procedures  and  regulations  manual;  (iii) installing  hardware  and  software  for  a  more \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening the Debt Management Capacity of \nthe Department of Aid and Debt Management. Manila. (TA 4398-BHU, approved on 28 September).  \n2  This TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 September 2006. \n3  ADB. 2006.

Manila.  \n ", "2   \nsophisticated debt monitoring and management system (the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt \nRecording and Management System 2000+ [CS-DRMS]); and (iv) providing user and data entry \ntraining on CS-DRMS to DADM and the Royal Monetary Authority (RMA) staff . \n \n6.  Following  the  successful  completion  of  these  two  previous  TAs,  a  follow-up  TA  is \nessential to develop DADM\u2019s debt management capacity fully and to address the financing \nneeds of the Government, minimize borrowing costs, keep risks associated with borrowing to an \nacceptable minimum, and provide feedback to policy makers for effective economic planning. \nTraining on CS-DRMS under the second TA project was only 5 days and DADM staff are not \nable to use the system. As a result, they are not able to carry out the major aspects of debt \nmanagement, e.g., generation of reports, writing country-specific reports using the system, \nformulation and implementation of a debt and borrowing strategy, management of the existing \ndebt portfolio, and provision of guidance on new terms of borrowing based on repayment \ncapabilities. DADM needs to be able to monitor all categories of domestic and foreign debt, and \nto analyze the existing debt stock with respect to currency composition, maturity profile, and the \ninterest rate structure. Only after the CS-DRMS is operational and DADM's staff are properly \ntrained can cost and risk be minimized, guidelines on the appropriate level and terms of new \nborrowings be defined, and timely debt-service repayment be ensured. \n \n7.   The TA will consolidate an audited database on all loans and grants and provide detailed \ntraining to DADM and RMA staff.  CS-DRMS is more than a computer package. It is a model of \nbest practice in debt management that incorporates all the major developments in analyzing and \nmanaging developing country debt. The installation of the latest version of CS-DRMS should \nenable DADM to manage the country\u2019s debt portfolio effectively by recording, reporting, and \nanalyzing a wide range of debt instruments from both economic and financial perspectives. \nWithout the current TA project, the newly installed CS-DRMS will continue to be underused and \nthe objective of increasing the debt management capacity of DADM will remain unachieved.       \n \n8.   The TA is consistent with ADB's country and strategy program (CSP), 2006\u20132010, for \nBhutan, which emphasized the need for capacity development in operations as well as in the \noverall management of the development process.  \n \n9.   The role of DADM in accounting, auditing, and fund flow management is expanding and \nits accountability as a service provider to line ministries is becoming more clearly defined. \nEffective  management  of  data  on  internal  and  external  public  debt  is  crucial.  This  will \nnecessitate  the  compilation  and  processing  of  all  debt-related  data  to  enable  reliable  and \ncomplete internal and external reporting on debt and related issues. The TA will address that \nneed  by  operationalizing  the  debt  management  system  so  it  supports  the  macroeconomic \nobjectives and framework of the country.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.   The impact of the advisory TA would be to improve the governance of the Government \nthrough the specific outcome of strengthened debt management capacity of DADM which would \nfacilitate debt analysis for effective macroeconomic planning of Bhutan\u2019s economy. This TA \nproject will build on the findings and outputs of previous TAs (footnotes 1 and 4), and further \ndevelop the debt management capacity of DADM.  \n ", "3  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   The TA will support the following activities: (i) an on-site inspection and audit of the \ndatabase to ensure its accuracy; (ii) workshops and user training for staff from the research and \nstatistics  divisions  at  DADM  and  RMA  staff  on  debt  recording,  monitoring,  management, \nportfolio review, sustainability analyses, and projections, as well as on country-specific report \nwriting; (iii) on-the-job training on how to use the new software to produce analyses and reports \nfor  Government  departments  and  international  financial  institutions,  and  (iv)  basic  trouble-\nshooting on the daily operation of the new software.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $240,000. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $200,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance the balance of $40,000 equivalent through the provision of office and \nworkshop space and facilities, counterpart staff, and secretarial support. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are set out in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.   DADM of the MOF will be the executing agency for the TA. The director general of \nDADM will oversee the TA implementation. The TA will be implemented during a 6-month period \nstarting in January 2007 and ending in July 2007. One member of staff will be nominated from \nDADM,  and  will  work  closely  with  the  TA  consultant  to  facilitate  timely  and  effective  TA \nimplementation. \n \n14.   ADB will engage one international consultant through a consulting firm in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants for a total of 3 person-months. Consultancy \nservices will be delivered intermittently. The consulting firm will be engaged through single \nsource selection5 to ensure prompt provision of consultancy services. Single source selection is \nappropriate in this case for the following reasons: (i) the consulting firm is clearly more qualified \nthan any other for the assignment since the firm successfully completed an earlier part of the \nwork, i.e. CSDRMS installation and provision of data entry training to DADM under TA 4398; (ii) \nthe requirements of the proposed TA (i.e. operationalization of CSDRMS) represents a natural \ncontinuation of previous work carried out by the consulting firm; and (iii) the consulting firm has \nunique  qualifications  by  being  the  sole  distributor  for  CS-DRMS  in  non-Commonwealth \ncountries. The consulting firm will provide a consultant who is a debt management software \nspecialist. The consultant will review the recommendations of the previous TA with a view to \ntranslating them into the operationalization of CS-DRMS 2000+ software package for staff from \nDADM as well as for staff from RMA\u2019s research and statistics division. The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.   The consultant will prepare (i) an inception report within 15 days of fielding, which will \ninclude a needs-based assessment and an action plan; (ii) a midterm report submitted 2.5 \nmonths after fielding; (iii) a draft final report submitted 2 weeks before the end of the assignment; \nand (iv) a final report at the end of the assignment. All reports will be submitted (in hard and soft \ncopies) to both DADM and ADB for review and comments. The consultant will incorporate the \ncomments  received  from  DADM  and  ADB  before  finalizing  the  reports.  The  findings  and \n                                                 \n5 The consulting firm under TA 4398, Crown Agents of UK, performed satisfactorily and will be contracted for this \nfollow-on TA. \n ", "4   \nrecommendations of the inception report and the draft final report will be discussed during \ntripartite meetings. \n \n16.  Overseas training will be conducted at the Crown Agents training center in London, UK. \nCrown Agents is the sole distributor for CS-DRMS in non-Commonwealth countries such as \nBhutan. Overseas training will allow for advanced CS-DRMS training courses for DADM officers \nincluding \u2018New Challenges in Debt Management for Loan Departments\u2019, \u2018Debt Restructuring \nTechniques\u2019,  and  \u2018Effective  Domestic  Debt  Management\u2019.  The  overseas  training  will  be \nprocured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Crown Agents will be directly contracted \nbecause it is the sole distributor for CS-DRMS in non-Commonwealth countries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance, not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000, on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bhutan  for  Capacity  Building  of  the  Department  of  Aid  and  Debt \nManagement\u2019s Debt Management Unit, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "    Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary   Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nIndicators/Targets   Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved governance of the  Increased efficiency,  Technical assistance (TA)  Commitment of the \nGovernment of Bhutan  effectiveness, and  progress reports   Government of Bhutan, \naccountability of Bhutan\u2019s    policy makers, and \npublic administration   Department of Aid and Debt  practitioners to adopt and \n  Management (DADM) periodic  maintain the Government\u2019s \nreports on the financial position  Ninth Five-Year Plan, in \nof Bhutan\u2019s economy.   particular the objective of \n  good governance \nAsian Development Bank (ADB)   \nreview missions \n \nOutcome       Assumptions \n       \nStrengthened debt  A complete and consolidated  Descriptive and analytical  Commitment of the \nmanagement capacity of  database on all domestic  reports prepared by DADM on  Government of Bhutan, \nDADM, facilitating debt  and international public debt  external borrowing and the  policy makers, and \nanalysis for effective  and publicly guaranteed  budget of Bhutan with a view to  practitioners to adopt and \nmacroeconomic planning for  private sector debt  guiding budget discussions and  maintain a comprehensive \nBhutan\u2019s overall economy    macroeconomic  debt recording and \n  Proficient use of debt  planning  management system \n  management and     \nsustainability software  Consultant\u2019s inception, midterm,  Full cooperation and \nby DADM  and final reports   participation of  the \n    Government, DADM, RMA, \nPrudential management of  Consultations with other  and other stakeholders \nthe debt portfolio and  departments of the Government,  during the TA \nprovision of analytical reports  e.g., Department of Budget and  implementation  \nand guidance on new terms  Accounts, and the Royal   \nof borrowing taking account  Monetary Authority (RMA) of  Available expertise to meet \nof the country's repayment  Bhutan  output requirements. \ncapacity and development     \npriorities  Tripartite meetings \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \nA complete and consolidated  Commonwealth Secretariat-  Feedback from workshop  DADM will have staff \ndatabase on all loans and  Debt Recording and  participants in the form of  members who will be \ngrants  Management System  assessment surveys.  trained on the use of debt \n  operationalized and tested    recording, monitoring, and \nStrengthened debt  (May 2007).
