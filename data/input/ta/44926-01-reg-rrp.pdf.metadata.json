I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in the Clean Resources Asia Growth (CRAG) Fund of up to $20 million and in \nthe Renewable Energy Asia (REA) Fund of up to $20 million, in each case not to exceed 25% of \nthe total commitments with respect to the fund and not resulting in the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  being  the  largest  investor  in  the  fund.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background \n2.  Aggressive development throughout Asia has put substantial pressure on the region\u2019s \nresource base and natural environment. This development path will need to be balanced over \nthe long term with resource alternatives that are more sustainable. The clean energy market \ncomprises  companies  and  projects  that  provide  solutions  to  improve  the  use  of  natural \nresources to reduce negative ecological impacts. Increasingly broader in scope, the market \nembraces multiple industries with diverse needs and at varying points in the production cycle\u2014\ngeneration, procurement, use and reuse, and residual disposal.  (See Table 1 for examples of \nvarious industries related to the clean energy market.) \n \nTable 1: Industries Related to the Clean Energy Market \n \nWater and  Pollution and \nEnergy  Industrial  Consumer \nAgriculture  Waste \nElectricity generation  Treatment and  Industrial waste  Automotives  Green and \nStorage  purification  Consumer waste  Manufacturing  sustainable goods \nEfficiency and  Distribution and  Carbon  Transport and  and services \ndemand  reclamation  Water, air, soil  logistics \nmanagement  Desalination  pollution  Biochemicals \nFuels  Sustainable \nBiomass  agriculture \nSource: CRAG Fund private placement memorandum, February 2010. \n \n3.  Through a combination of economic, political, regulatory, and social drivers, the clean \nenergy industry has risen to prominence in mitigating strategic risks facing individual economies \nand the global community. Many proponents now view the clean energy industry as the most \nsignificant investment opportunity for 2010 to 2020. Investment in Asia and the Pacific provide a \nmeans to enhance investment returns in clean energy for three core reasons:   \n(i)  Asia\u2019s demand for clean energy and technology solutions will outpace that of the \nrest of the world. With some of the world\u2019s largest economies and two of the \nworld\u2019s most populous nations, Asia is expected to remain a driver of world gross \ndomestic product (GDP) over the next several years, outpacing many developed-\nworld economies in the process. Asia\u2019s strong macroeconomic and demographic \ndrivers will continue to spur superior growth in demand for innovative solutions in \nenergy, water supply, and pollution control. Based on the International Energy \nAgency\u2019s  latest  estimates,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  and  India \ntogether are expected to account for over half of the global increase in energy \ndemand from current levels to 2030. Combined, Asia\u2019s economies should drive \n60% of new energy demand.   ", "2       \n \n(ii)  A disproportionate share of the supply chain for clean technologies will originate \nin Asia. As has been the case in other manufacturing sectors, the region should \nbenefit disproportionately from its unique supply chain manufacturing base. For \nexample, even with limited domestic demand, the PRC has become the leading \nsolar photovoltaic module manufacturer globally.  \n(iii)  Asia  is  relatively  underserved  by  dedicated  clean  energy  capital  sources, \nattracting less than 5% of clean technology investment to date, versus about \n15% of total private equity and venture capital investment. As satellite operations \nin the region are scaled back by firms without a core base in Asia because of the \ncurrent  global  economic  environment,  the  funds  are  well-positioned  to  be \nopportunistic and can capitalize on the reduced competition and focus of earlier \nand existing investors.   \n4.  Regulatory  status.  There  is  considerable  regulatory  support  for  the  clean  energy \nmarket. The governments of the two funds\u2019 target countries are developing mechanisms to \nstimulate renewable energy and sustainable technology, as follows: \n \n5.  People\u2019s Republic of China. The PRC\u2019s policy goals provide for the building of an \nenergy efficient society. The 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010) sets the goal of quadrupling GDP \nby 2020, while only doubling energy consumption. Energy consumption per unit of GDP must be \ncut by 20% of 2005 levels by the end of 2010. The PRC\u2019s Medium and Long-Term Energy \nConservation Plan,1 if implemented in full, will limit energy consumption by 2020 to 3 billion tons \nof coal equivalent, instead of the 4 billion tons of coal equivalent predicted if current trends \ncontinue. Since 2004, the PRC has been building an ultra-high-voltage electricity transmission \ninfrastructure of the kind that renewable energy supporters in the United States and European \nUnion are seeking, and the program has subsequently become the cornerstone of power-grid \ndevelopment  of  the  current  5-year  plan,  further  expanding  opportunities  for  intermittent \nrenewable  energy  generation.  Additionally,  as  part  of  the  $498  billion  economic  stimulus \npackage of November 2008, the government plans to enhance sewage and waste treatment \nfacilities, prevent water pollution, accelerate forest planting programs, and increase energy \nconservation initiatives and pollution control projects. \n \n6.  India. India represents one of the most attractive current investment opportunities in \nAsia due to the combination of (i) growth in demand for energy, (ii) liberalized electricity markets \nthat  facilitate  merchant  selling  and  off-take  structures  that  support  independent  power \nproducers, (iii) high availability of untapped natural resources, and (iv) mature regulatory and \nfiscal incentives for foreign and local investment in renewable energy. Nationally, the Ministry for \nNew  and  Renewable  Energy  provides financial  support  and  implements  renewable  energy \npolicies.  The  Indian  Renewable  Energy  Development  Agency  (IREDA)  provides  low-cost \nfinancing.  At  the  state  level,  individual  state  regulatory  commissions  implement  renewable \npolicies. \n \n7.  The Government of India has set an objective of achieving an installed renewable-based \ngeneration capacity of 10,000 megawatts (MW) by 2012, largely in the areas of wind and small \nhydropower. A number of fiscal benefits in the form of duty exemptions, income tax holidays, \nand accelerated depreciation norms have been extended. In addition, the IREDA has also been \nextending financial support to interested investors. Some of the key legislative, policy, and other \nmeasures initiated by the various stakeholders for promoting renewable energy are as follows: \n(i)  the Electricity Act of 2003 provides for state commissions to fix a minimum \npercentage for purchase of energy from renewable energy sources. Some of the \nstate commissions have initiated measures in this direction; \n                                                \n1 Beijing Energy Efficiency Center. Energy Saving. http://www.beconchina.org/energy_saving.htm. ", "     3 \n(ii)  the National Tariff Policy recognizes that renewable sources of energy should be \noffered a preferential tariff (until the time that technologies evolve) so that they \ncan compete with conventional sources of electricity generation; \n(iii)  power generation across India has been stepped up, with the federal government \nmaking strong promises to extend electricity across rural India between 2009 and \n2014. Decentralized renewables will play an important role in the proposed rural \nelectrification of almost 5,400 hamlets and villages as they speed up deployment \nand reduce the costs associated with transmission2; \n(iv)  the  government  is  attempting  to  provide  incentives  for  the  development  of \nhydropower across the nation. Legislation has been proposed to allow private \nhydroelectric power developers to be eligible over 5 years for a tariff that would \nguarantee a fixed return on investment, as well as allowing generators to improve \ntheir returns by selling up to 40% of their electricity on the spot market.3 \n \n8.  The Philippines. Driven by a growing population and increasing energy needs, the \nenergy  market  in  the  Philippines  has  undergone  a  process  of  deregulation,  with  strong \ncontinuing support from the government for private investment in renewable energy generation. \nHighlights include the following measures: \n(i)  The Electricity and Power Industry Reform Act (2001), which provides for an \nopen and competitive power industry. \n(ii)   The Wholesale Electricity Supply Market (2006), which enables market forces to \nset energy prices. \n(iii)  The Renewable Energy Act (2008, implemented 2009), which provides \n(a)  prioritization of purchase, grid connection, and transmission of electricity \ngenerated by companies from renewable energy sources; \n(b)  income tax holidays for 7 years and reduced corporate tax thereafter; \n(c)  exemption from value added tax of generated renewable power ; \n(d)  tax exemption on income from carbon credits; and \n(e)  a  maximum  1.5%  import  tax  on  original  equipment  and  facilities  to \nproduce renewable energy. \n(iv)  The Renewable Energy Act also provides for \n(a)  a renewable portfolio standard mechanism, which is a regulation that \nrequires  the  increased  production  of  energy  from  renewable  energy \nsources; and \n(b)  a feed-in tariff offering a guaranteed fixed price for at least 12 years (and \nwhich  must  be  above  market  rates)  for  electricity  produced  from \nrenewables, notably wind, small hydropower, and biomass. \n \n9.  The combination of these factors makes the Philippines a very attractive environment for \nrenewable energy investment. The effect of positive legislation and deregulation is to raise both \nthe minimum and potential maximum of investment returns for an investor in renewable energy \nin the Philippines. The overall output from the stated policy is seeking to increase installed \ncapacity by 100% by 2013 (to more than 4 gigawatts).  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n10.  Each of the funds is established to make private equity investments in clean energy \nprojects and companies in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). As such, they are \n                                                \n2 Government of India, Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. 2009. Government of India Statistics. Delhi. \n3 United States Department of Energy. 2008. International Energy Outlook. Washington, DC. \n ", "4       \n \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20204, which seeks to reduce poverty and improve living conditions \nand  quality  of  life  in  part  by  scaling  up  private  sector  development  and  supporting \nenvironmentally sustainable development, particularly with respect to projects that aim to reduce \ncarbon dioxide emissions and that address climate change.     \n \n2.  Consistency with Country Strategies \n11.  The proposed investments are broadly aligned with the country strategies for the various \ncountries to be targeted by the funds, key among which are the PRC, India, and the Philippines.  \n \n12.  People\u2019s Republic of China. In its country partnership strategy5 (CPS) with ADB, the \nPRC recognizes the need to improve its energy efficiency and redefine its energy mix toward a \nmore environmentally friendly combination. The country\u2019s goals as outlined in the CPS include \n(i) ensuring resource efficiency and environmental sustainability by adopting clean and efficient \nenergy,  among  other  important  sector-specific  platforms;  and  (ii)  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development  through  private  sector  financing  and  other \ninterventions needed to increase private sector participation in the development activities of the \nPRC.  The  second  goal  underscores  the  PRC\u2019s  recognition  of  the  need  for  private  sector \nparticipation in sustaining economic growth and meeting the targets set for the coming decades. \n \n13.  The PRC CPS further emphasizes that an increasing level of private sector involvement \nwould  address  certain  funding  gaps  and  investment  needs  in  the  country,  and  would \ncomplement the (relatively limited) public sector funds dedicated to infrastructure, including \nclean energy. While the public sector window of ADB is continuously collaborating with the \nGovernment of the PRC to improve the country's regulatory climate for both local and foreign \nclean  energy  investments,  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  can  and  should,  in \nparallel, use its experience and competence to work with private entities in the PRC to catalyze \ninvestment into the clean energy sector. \n \n14.  India. India's CPS6 for 2009\u20132012 emphasizes the urgent need to carry out energy \ninfrastructure  projects  to  meet  future  power  requirements.  At  present,  coverage  of  rural \nhousehold electrification, for example, is still at a low level of about 33%, and the quality of \npower remains poor due to \"(i) insufficient power generation capacities in these areas, (ii) lack of \noptimum utilization of the generation capacity, (iii) an inadequate and aging sub-transmission \nand distribution network, (iv) large scale theft and a skewed tariff structure, (v) the slow pace of \nrural electrification, and (vi) inefficient use of electricity by the consumers.\"  \n \n15.  These challenges are seen to plague the country's energy security and the sustainability \nof economic progress. Thus, together with ADB, India has established an energy sector results \nframework within its strategy and has developed ambitious overall target outcomes, such as (i) \nadding at least 70 MW of solar power generation, (ii) adding at least 982 MW of hydropower \ngeneration, and (iii) building an efficient power transmission network. The strategy similarly \nacknowledges the greater role of the private sector in realizing these goals through funding \nsome of the needed infrastructure. \n \n16.  The Philippines. The enactment and implementation of the Electric Power Industry \nReform Act (EPIRA) initiated the privatization of the power sector in the country. It has created a \ncompetitive  landscape  for  participants  in  the  power  sector,  which  is  expected  to  provide \naffordable electricity tariffs in the long term. The EPIRA also started supporting ventures to \n                                                \n4 ADB, 2007.

Renewable  energy  project  proposals \nincreased in recent years but only a few were realized (one wind energy project in northern \nPhilippines and other small-scale waste-to-energy projects). As a result, the rapid urbanization \nin many parts of the country has strained the capacity of the limited number of power generating \nfacilities. There are current efforts to increase these installations but they are stymied by the \nlack  of  foreign  capital  investments  targeting  the  clean  energy  sector.  The  CPS  for  the \nPhilippines7 specifies targets in the energy sector, and is generally geared toward achieving \nreliable and affordable electricity supply.  \n \n3.  Consistency with the Sector Strategy \n17.  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy8 seeks  to facilitate  a transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and \nuniversal access to energy, thereby achieving ADB\u2019s vision of a region free of poverty. The \nobjective of the policy is to help DMCs provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy for \ninclusive growth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. The policy \nemphasizes energy efficiency and renewable energy; access to energy for all; and energy \nsector  reforms,  capacity  building,  and  governance.  To  achieve  these  objectives,  policy \nimplementation  will  be  based  in  part  on  private  sector  participation  (and  public\u2013private \npartnership)  to  improve  energy  sector  efficiency  through  competition  and  an  increase  in \ninvestable resources in DMCs. ADB and other multilateral development organizations have \npoured capital into this sector through public sector loans and other financing mechanisms for \nclean energy projects. However, the investment has been insufficient to build and sustain the \nincreasingly energy-intensive infrastructure and economic activities of countries in Asia and the \nPacific. The private sector must fill the gap by allocating financial resources and technical \nexpertise for clean energy businesses in ADB's DMCs.  \n \n4.  Lessons Learned from Previous Operations \n18.  ADB has learned lessons from its experiences investing in clean energy funds through a \nrequest for proposals (paras. 10\u201312).  The lesson drawn from these experiences was that it \ntakes time and effort to incubate first-time emerging markets funds in a challenging fund-raising \nenvironment. This incubating role is appropriate in particular circumstances, such as when ADB \nwants to help develop a new asset class (or sector within the asset class) where few managers \nexist and so there is not the luxury of choice among established managers (as was the case \nwith the 2007 request for proposals for clean energy funds). However, where the asset class \ndoes exist and there are experienced managers in the market, ADB should focus on selecting \nthose fund managers that have the highest likelihood of fund-raising and deployment success \nbut which may fall short without ADB. This is the case for clean energy funds today; the \ndevelopment of this asset class was aided in part by ADB\u2019s institutional efforts to develop the \nclean energy sector across Asia and the Pacific. ADB\u2019s leadership in promoting this new asset \nclass (i.e., clean energy funds) has been well received in the market, and market participants \narticulate the desire for ADB to continue taking a leadership role in the clean energy private \nequity industry in emerging Asian markets.     \n \nC.  Development Impact \n1.  Outputs and Outcome \n19.  The key output of ADB\u2019s investment will be the establishment of the funds and their \npolicies. The funds\u2019 investments in clean energy and environment projects or companies, and \n                                                \n7 ADB. 2005, Country Strategy and Program: Philippines, 2005\u20132007.

The ultimate development impact of the proposed investment will be increased \ncontribution  of  investee  companies  and  projects  to  economic  growth,  improved  corporate \ngovernance in investee companies and projects, and reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in \nADB\u2019s DMCs. \n \n \nIII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES  \nA.  Clean Resources Asia Growth Fund \n1.  Sponsor and Ownership \n21.  The CRAG Fund is sponsored by CLSA Capital Partners (CLSACP). CLSACP is a \nwholly owned subsidiary of the CLSA Group, an independent brokerage and investment group \nthat has been operating in Asia since 1986. CLSACP has in excess of $2.7 billion of assets \nunder management across ten funds. The CRAG Fund is part of CLSACP\u2019s Clean Resources \nCapital (CRC) platform, which also includes four public equity funds, all of which focus on the \nshared theme of \u2015clean and green\u2016 investing. The CRAG Fund is a Cayman Islands exempted \nlimited partnership.   \n \n2.  Governance Structure \na.  Management  \n22.  General  partner.  The  general  partner  of  the  fund  is  CLSA  Clean  Resources  Asia \nGrowth Management Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company, which is wholly owned by \nCLSA and will be responsible for all investment and disposition decisions on behalf of the \nCRAG Fund. \n  \n23.  Although this is a first-time fund team, its skill set\u2014which combines clean energy and \nenvironment project development, corporate finance, operations, and equity (including private \nequity) transactional experience\u2014is an appropriate combination of talents for the needs of the \nfund. Additionally, beyond the staff working directly on the fund team, the fund\u2019s operations will \nreceive  support  through  CLSACP\u2019s  institutional  experience  and  its  lessons  learned  from \ninvesting in private equity in Asia over the past dozen years, as well as through other specific \nindividuals  within  CLSACP  and  throughout  CLSA,  including  support  functions.  The  fund\u2019s \ninvestment committee will  also  represent  an  important  contribution  to  the  human  resource \ncapacity of the fund. \n \nb.  Corporate Governance \n24.  The CRAG Fund will have an advisory board consisting of representatives of the limited \npartners, including ADB.  \n \nc.  Risk Management  \n25.  The general partner will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed  of \nmembers with extensive experience in clean energy and investment management.  \n ", "     7 \n3.  Business Overview and Strategy \n    a.  Investment Objectives   \n26.  The CRAG Fund seeks to leverage the domain knowledge and industry contacts of its \nsponsor\u2019s clean technology platform. The CRAG Fund will capitalize on its management team\u2019s \nUnited States and Asian clean technology experience and global network of clean technology \ninvestors to identify and invest in (i) proven clean technologies for application in Asian markets, \n(ii) critical elements of the Asia-based supply chain for clean resource technologies, and (iii) \nhigh-growth clean technology companies engaged in expanding sales volumes and production \ncapacities.   \n \nb.  Investment Strategy \n \n27.  The CRAG Fund intends to invest primarily in operating businesses within the global \nclean technology sector at the growth or expansion stage of development that have revenues \nand operations in Asian markets.  \n \nB.  Renewable Energy Asia Fund \n1.  Sponsor and Ownership \n28.  The REA Fund will be a limited partnership registered in England pursuant to the Limited \nPartnerships Act 1907. The general partner will be REAF General Partner, a Scottish limited \npartnership. The fund will be managed by Berkeley Energy, a first-time fund manager set up in \n2007 to establish and manage the REA Fund. The REA Fund seeks to invest in renewable \nenergy infrastructure projects in Asia, with a focus on India, the Philippines, and other countries \nin Southeast Asia. The management team is based in London and Manila, and is in the process \nof setting up an office in India. The REA Fund will be owned by its investors. \n \n2.  Governance Structure \na.  Management  \n29.  The REA Fund will be managed by the team of Berkeley Energy, an English limited \nliability partnership.  Although this is a first-time fund management team, its skill set, which \ncombines  project  development,  corporate  finance,  operations,  and  equity  transactional \nexperience, is an appropriate combination of talents for the needs of the REA Fund.  \n \nb.  Corporate Governance \n30.  The REA Fund will have a strategic advisory board and an investor advisory committee \ncomprised of representatives of the REA Fund limited partners selected by the general partner \n(and will include ADB).   \n \nc.  Risk Management  \n31.  The REA Fund manager will manage risk through its investment process, which involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  composed  of \nmembers with extensive experience in clean energy and investment management.  \n \n ", "8       \n \n3.  Business Overview and Strategy \na.  Investment Objectives and Policies   \n \n32.  The REA Fund will invest into post-permitting renewable energy projects and project \ndevelopers using proven technologies in, primarily, India and the Philippines, generating project \nrevenue through green electricity, carbon credits, and/or energy by-products.   \n \nb.    Investment Strategy \n \n33.  Over the course of its 5-year investment period, the REA Fund\u2019s strategy will be to \nmature and consolidate investments into operating portfolios. The REA Fund will seek to make \ninvestments in renewable energy projects and project developers in India, the Philippines, and \nother DMCs. Targeted renewable technologies will be wind, small hydro, and other proven \ntechnologies, in projects that are in the post-permitting stage.   \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n34.  ADB proposes to make equity investments of up to $20 million in each fund, or 25% of \nthe total commitments in respect of each fund, whichever is less. ADB will not be the single \nlargest investor in either fund.  \n \n35.  The targeted CRAG Fund size is $200 million, and the targeted REA Fund size is \u20ac150 \nmillion.   \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n36.  There are a number of justifications for ADB\u2019s support of these investments. First, ADB \nwill have a catalytic role in the fund-raising being undertaken by the funds. Even though the \nfunds have already achieved first closings, ADB's participation will help them achieve the target \nfund size, and will assist in raising funds from potential investors that gain confidence from \nADB's decision. This will help to develop the capital markets in the region by filling the gap that \ncurrently exists with regard to capital for clean energy projects.  \n \n37.  Another  important  value  addition  of  ADB\u2019s  investment  in  the  funds  arises from the \nrequirement that sustainable development issues and concerns are addressed in every investee \nproject of the funds. ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies and procedures will \nhelp to guide the funds at every step in ensuring the sustainability of their future clean energy \nprojects. This is an important value addition, since the funds\u2019 target countries frequently possess \nfragile and exploited environments as a result of prior uncontrolled industrial activity, as well as \nthe  possible  existence  of  vulnerable  communities  including  indigenous  groups  or  ethnic \nminorities who may be adversely affected, and to which ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies and \nprocedures may apply.  \n \n38.  Lastly, it is also hoped, given the significant need for private investments in the clean \nenergy sectors of the funds' target countries, that ADB\u2019s intervention through the funds will help \nmobilize capital to support other private equity funds to pursue this path. This demonstration \neffect will help to develop a class of new fund managers and financial professionals in the \nsustainability sectors in the target regions. \n ", "     9 \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards   \n39.  ADB\u2019s investment in the funds is classified as category FI under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The funds will each be required to establish and implement an appropriate \nenvironmental and social management system (ESMS) to ensure that its investee companies \nmeet national laws and ADB\u2019s requirements in the countries in which these companies are \nlocated. ADB will coordinate with the respective fund managers to ensure that the ESMS is \nadopted  before  disbursement  for  the  first  investment,  and  guide  the  fund  managers  in \nenvironmental and social safeguards due diligence, monitoring, and reporting.   \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n40.  The fund managers were advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require the funds\u2019 general partners, managers, and sponsors to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \nthe purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, \nand  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and the funds will further allow ADB to investigate any violation or \npotential violation of these undertakings. \n \nC.  Assurances \n41.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nassistance to the REA Fund.9  Following the approval of the proposed investment by ADB's \nBoard  of  Directors,  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  documentation,  in  a  form  and  substance \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n42.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investments would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ninvestment  of  up  to  $20,000,000  in  the  Clean  Resources  Asia  Growth  Fund  and  up  to \n$20,000,000 in the Renewable Energy Asia Fund from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n4 November 2010\n                                                \n9  The Government of India\u2019s no objection will be sought for the REA Fund due to the high likelihood that investments \nfrom the REA Fund will be made in India subsequent to ADB\u2019s investment in the fund. \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance Targets \nSummary  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions \n  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased contribution  By time of fund\u2019s exit,  The funds\u2019 quarterly and  The fund managers invest in \nof investee companies  investee companies  annual reports  opportunities capable of \nand projects to the  and projects increase    generating commercially \neconomy   net income and taxes    attractive returns. \n  paid by 100% and     \n  100% over levels at     \n  time of investment     \n       \nImproved corporate  International standards  The funds\u2019 quarterly and  Investees of the respective \ngovernance in investee  for financial reporting  annual reports  funds are willing to accept \ncompanies and projects  and corporate    the respective fund's advice \n  governance established    to improve their business \n  in 100% of funds\u2019    operations. \n  investment companies     \n  by 2019     \n       \nReductions in  Savings in greenhouse  ADB evaluation reports   \ngreenhouse gas  gas emissions of \nemissions   556,246 tCO /yeara \n2\n   \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased access to  Investors' committed  The funds\u2019 quarterly and  Targeted DMC governments \nfinance and expertise in  capital is fully drawn  annual reports  maintain legal and regulatory \nclean energy projects  down by 2015    frameworks that facilitate \nand companies in the      private equity investments in \ntarget regionsb  The funds invest in at  The funds\u2019 quarterly and  clean energy projects. \n  least 16 renewable  annual reports   \nenergy and clean    The fund managers find \ntechnology projects by    attractive clean energy \nthe end of their    investment opportunities. \nrespective commitment     \nperiodsc    Third-party debt and other \n    financing schemes are \nInstitutions in which the  ADB evaluation reports  available to provide leverage \nfund invests are  for the funds\u2019 investments. \ncompliant with ADB's \nSafeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) \nOutput      Assumption \nThe funds and their  The funds raise their  An ESMS document  There is market interest to \npolicies are established  target sizes by 2011  satisfactory to ADB is  invest in clean energy \nas planned    approved by the fund and  projects and companies in \n  An ESMS is  submitted to ADB before  targeted DMCs. \n  established by each  disbursement for the first   \n  fund.   subproject.
