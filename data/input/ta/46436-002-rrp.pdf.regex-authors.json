I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Independent State of Samoa for the Samoa AgriBusiness Support Project.1 \n \n2.  The  project  will  promote  commercializing  and  exporting  agricultural  produce  and \nprocessed products along agro-value chains to stimulate agriculture\u2019s role in economic growth \nand poverty reduction in Samoa. It will provide business support services and financing to \nagribusinesses.2   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Samoa  has  yet to  return  to  pre-tsunami  (2009)  economic growth  levels,  which  the \ngovernment seeks to redress through promoting tourism and agriculture. Revitalizing agriculture \nand increasing exports therefore feature prominently in the government\u2019s policy framework, \nincluding the Strategy for the Development of Samoa, the Agricultural Sector Plan, and the \nNational Export Strategy. Agriculture and fisheries contributed only 9.7% to Samoa\u2019s gross \ndomestic product in 2012, down from 20% in the 1990s.3 Food and agricultural product imports \n(26%\u201328% of total imports) contribute significantly to Samoa\u2019s overall trade deficit. Although \nagriculture employs 32.9% of the total workforce, rural unemployment or underemployment is a \nmajor concern. Subsistence production dominates Samoa\u2019s agriculture sector, with occasional \nsurpluses for sale in local markets. The 2009 agricultural census reports that only 3% of rural \nhouseholds  received  their  main  income from selling  agricultural  produce.4 The  smallholder \nsector is being supported through a World Bank project.5    \n \n4.  In the agribusiness sector, including commercial farming and agro-industrial enterprises, \ntrade statistics show a total agriculture food export (fresh and processed) decline from ST61 \nmillion in 2002 to ST45 million in 2012.6 Agribusinesses are critical for stimulating agricultural \nproduction,  even  though  their  total  number  is  small,  yet  they  are  not  supported.  While \nagribusinesses have few price-based comparative advantages in the international market, they \nhave comparative advantage in niche markets. Most agribusinesses are small-scale, family-\nowned enterprises with fewer than 400 employees, mostly in agro-industrial production (e.g., \nchili sauce, banana chips) and fresh products for export (e.g., taro, Tahitian lime). Average \nannual  turnover  levels  are  $200,000  for  smaller  and  above  $1  million  for  a  few  larger \ncompanies. However, they provide employment and income-earning opportunities for many \nsmallholder families in Samoa as suppliers for raw materials, acting as inclusive businesses. \nAgribusiness development is therefore essential for promoting agriculture\u2019s role in the economy. \n \n5.  Value chain analyses and a sector assessment confirmed that there is potential for \nexport expansion and import substitution. 7 The studies also revealed patterns of weaknesses \nand bottlenecks, which contribute to the low investment and value addition in the sector. Some \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Samoa AgriBusiness \nSupport Project (ADB. 2012.

", "2   \nof these shortcomings are being addressed by development partners and Asian Development \nBank (ADB) technical assistance, including access to land and business enabling environment.8  \n \n6.  The value chain analyses and agribusiness survey9 highlighted insufficiently integrated \nagriculture  value  chains  that  effectively  link  subsistence  farmers  with  agribusinesses  and \nthrough this, into the global marketplace. With few exceptions, Samoan agribusinesses struggle \nto procure sufficient and consistently good quality raw materials. Examples include (i) virgin \ncoconut  oil  producers  that  cannot  fill  existing  export  orders,  and  (ii)  shortages  of  taro  for \nprocessing into snack foods and of the appropriate fresh varieties for export. Most enterprises \nprocure  the  raw  materials  offered  to  them  by  smallholders  but  do  not  actively  encourage \nproduction  through  supply  chain  linkages  that  include  contract  farming,  outgrower \narrangements, or product collection networks. Through effective participation in value chains, \nrural producers and agribusinesses will increase household incomes and sales volumes, and \ncreate more jobs.   \n \n7.  The agribusiness survey further identified the need for a range of business support \nservices.  Businesses  producing  for  the  local  or  export  markets  are  failing  to  achieve  the \nrequired consistent standards to compete effectively and/or satisfy overseas markets\u2019 entry \nrequirements. Common weaknesses include (i) lack of technical skills for effective production \nmanagement, establishment and maintenance of strong supply chains, and for food safety \nstandards accreditation; (ii) inadequate export planning and marketing; and (iii) weak business \nand financial management. With limited technical and business support services available, \ncompanies report difficulties in accessing support from regional donor-supported programs.10   \n \n8.  The lack of capital and finance further constrains business expansion and diversification. \nLoans are difficult to obtain and expensive due to insufficient acceptable collateral, limited own \ncapital, and the banks\u2019 overall negative perception of the agriculture sector and enterprise \ncapabilities. Commercial banks require 200% security cover, compared to the regional and \nglobal requirement of 150%.11 Commercial bank loans to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries \nprojects  totaled  only  1.3%  of  total  bank  loan  volume,  while  6%  of  loans  went  to  the \nmanufacturing sector, which includes agribusinesses.12 Companies face difficulties securing \nadditional  equity  as  there  is  no  local  stock  exchange  or  equity  and/or  venture  capital  or \nprovident funds interested in relatively small agriculture and/or agribusiness projects in Samoa.  \n \n9.  The project aims to boost economic performance through increased trade and address \nmarket failures associated with export barriers arising from value chain constraints. The project \nwill lessen these constraints while operating within the national strategic and policy frameworks\u2019 \nobjectives. These objectives emphasize developing commercial farming and export-oriented \nagribusinesses  in  parallel  with  the  smallholder  subsector  and  complementing  development \npartners\u2019 activities. The private sector focus aligns with ADB\u2019s emphasis on private sector \ndevelopment as documented in the Pacific Approach and Samoa country operations business \nplan.13 The project design reflects lessons from other agribusiness, financing scheme, and \nprivate sector development programs in the Pacific islands and Samoa (footnote 8).

Manila. \n ", "      3 \nlesson was that simply addressing the common constraint of limited access to affordable and \nappropriate finance was insufficient. Financing must be tailored to the country context and \ncoupled with technical and business support services throughout the value chain to achieve \nimpact. The support services will also reduce the banks\u2019 concerns about potential borrowers\u2019 \ninternal capabilities and will help leverage commercial finance. \n \n10.  The multiple constraints, together with the challenges of a small island state, preclude \nstandard solutions. Solutions need to include (i) commercial banks as the lead facilitators of \nprivate sector development, (ii) capital to strengthen the balance sheet of agribusinesses, and \n(iii) technical and managerial support throughout the value chain. The project will therefore \nsupport developing the agribusiness sector in two complementary areas: (i) suitable financing \ninstruments and (ii) business support services. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The project impact will be that the  agriculture  sector regains its prominence  in the \neconomy. The outcome will be that selected commercial agribusinesses grow sustainably.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: Partner agribusinesses are provided with suitable financing services. \nThe innovative approach to financing will be through a financial intermediary (FI) modality, \nadjusted to the Samoan context. The design considers lessons from other ADB FI projects \n(footnote  8).  Participating  banks  (FIs)  will  provide  financing  to  eligible  subborrowers \n(agribusinesses or partner companies) that are sound and have bankable business plans. The \napproach  includes  (i)  cash  collateral  (from  grant  proceeds)  to  partly  secure  loans  by \nparticipating banks, address the constraints of inadequate collateral, and enable bank lending; \nand (ii) repayable supplemental seed capital (SSC) to address inadequate capital and weak \nbalance sheet structure.  \n \n13.  The cash collateral will be used to secure up to 50% of the amount FIs lend to eligible \nsubborrowers for first-time loans and up to 30% for second-time loans. Through this structure, \neach dollar of collateral will leverage twice the amount of bank lending. The FI can secure the \nloan\u2019s portion, not cash collateralized, according to its own prudential standards. The maximum \nloan for subborrowers is $750,000. This approach should contribute to an overall lower interest \nrate for the agribusinesses. SSC injections of a maximum $100,000 per company are intended \nto improve potential subborrowers\u2019 equity position if it would then be eligible for a loan as the FI \ndetermines. SSC is limited to 25% of total subproject costs, with the remaining part being \ncontributed through the subborrower\u2019s own capital and bank financing.  \n \n14.  An eligible subborrower will (i) be an enterprise in the agriculture or agribusiness sector, \n(ii) meet all conditions and requirements in Samoa\u2019s foreign investment legislation, and (iii) meet \ncredit  and  other  risk-related  criteria  as  the  FI  determines.14 To  be  as  market  oriented  as \npossible, the FI will assess the eligibility and commercial viability of selected agribusiness \nproposals  through  their  own  stringent  due  diligence  process.  Based  on  a  positive  credit \nassessment,  the  FI  will  structure  and  negotiate  suitable  financing  (subloan)  agreements, \n                                                \n14 Subproject eligibility will be based on (i) a finding of commercial viability based on the financial intermediary\u2019s (FI\u2019s) \ndue diligence, (ii) whether the subborrower meets at least 25% of its costs by a cash or in-kind contribution, (iii) \nwhether it contributes to diversification and/or expansion of agribusinesses, and (iv) whether it makes a beneficial \ncontribution to the agriculture sector or employment. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "4   \nincluding potential SSC portions, and it will monitor the subborrower\u2019s performance during the \nagreement\u2019s  lifetime.  A  facility  manager  (FM)  will  be  recruited  to  support  the  project \nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  in  project  implementation.  The  FM\u2019s  tasks  will  also  include \nidentification of agribusinesses for referral to the FI, overseeing the FI\u2019s screening and selection \nprocess, involvement in the due diligence processes of the agribusiness, and joint performance \nmonitoring with the FI. It is estimated that 10 to 15 businesses can be supported during the \nproject. Investments are expected to finance vertically integrated value chains, for example a \ntaro chips producer exporting to the New Zealand market that is upgrading its snack processing \nfacility and contracting a group of taro producers for raw materials. \n \n15.  Output 2: Partner agribusinesses are provided with business support services. \nThese services may comprise specific technical or financial management skills, and they will be \nidentified  during  the  due  diligence  process  of  selected  agribusinesses.  For  the  taro  chips \nproducer, this could be support in establishing proper outgrower schemes with farmers, or \nimproving products to fulfill importer requirements (e.g., food safety standards). The FM will \ncoordinate and provide individually tailored business support services by establishing workable \narrangements with regional support programs and sourcing specific technical expertise.15 The \nFM will work with FIs to (i) identify needed business support services; (ii) ensure the greatest \ndevelopment  impact  possible;  (iii)  verify  that  ADB\u2019s  social  and  environmental  safeguard \nstandards as well as eligibility and assessment criteria are adhered to,16 and after FI approval; \n(iv)  establish  business  partnership  arrangements  outlining  the  partners\u2019  roles  and \nresponsibilities, such as cost-sharing arrangements. A small agribusiness innovation scheme \nwill be made available to businesses for specific short-term purposes on a reimbursable basis. \n \n16.  Output 3: The project is efficiently and effectively managed. A PMU, supported by \nthe FM, will be established to monitor and evaluate project progress.  \n \nD.

The government has requested a grant17 not exceeding $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the project. The FIs will contribute $2 million in counterpart \nfunding.

Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the executing agency. A PMU will be set up in the \nMOF\u2019s  Aid  Coordination  and  Debt  Management  Division.  There  will  be  a  project  advisory \ncommittee, which will advise as needed to support the PMU on implementation issues.18 There \nwill  be  two  implementing  agencies:  the  participating  FIs  for  output  1,  and  the  MOF  for \nimplementation of outputs 2 and 3. The FM will support implementation of output 2 and overall \nproject coordination and implementation.  \n \n20.  The financing instruments will be open to all Samoan banks19 if they meet the eligibility \ncriteria and due diligence requirements,20 including (i) corporate, financial, management, and \ngovernance practices acceptable to ADB and the MOF; (ii) financial soundness and compliance \nwith applicable prudential guidelines; (iii) satisfaction of ADB\u2019s integrity, anti-money laundering, \nand combating the financing of terrorism due diligence requirements; and (iv) adequate policies, \nsystems,  and  procedures  to  assess  and  monitor  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental \nimpact of subprojects. ANZ Bank (Samoa) has met the requirements and has a good reputation \nand almost 50% market share. Hence, the government, with ADB\u2019s concurrence, selected ANZ \nBank  (Samoa)  as  a  financial  intermediary  to  receive  at  least  40%  of  the  grant  proceeds \nallocated as cash collateral and SSC. The remaining amounts will be allocated by the PMU, \nsubject to ADB concurrence, to further eligible FIs as the project develops. \n \n21.  Relending (government to FI). The ADB grant to the government will be in US dollars. \nA portion of up to $3 million will be used for the FI channel (output 1), of which approximately $2 \nmillion  will  be  for  cash  collateral  and  approximately  $1  million  for  repayable  SSC.  The \ngovernment will provide the funds, comprising cash collateral and SSC portions, to the FIs in \nlocal currency under the subsidiary financing agreement,21 and ADB will enter into project \nagreements with the same FI.  \n                                                \n17 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that Samoa had a high risk of debt \ndistress and was therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n18 The advisory committee will comprise of the MOF; Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries; Ministry of Commerce, \nIndustry and Labour; Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; and private sector representatives. \n19 These are ANZ Bank (Samoa), National Bank of Samoa, Samoa Commercial Bank, and Westpac Bank Samoa. \n20 ADB. 2003.

Onlending (FI to subborrowers). FIs will provide loans (subloan A) to subborrowers \nusing their own funds, secured in part by project cash collateral, at an appropriate market-based \ninterest rate. The tenor will not exceed 7 years.22 The FIs will use grant proceeds to onlend the \nSSC portion (subloan B) to subborrowers on an interest-free basis with a bullet repayment \nperiod not exceeding 7 years. After subloans A or B have been repaid, the FI can reuse funds \nfor future loans.23 \n \n23.  Should the FI not use the funds within the time specified in the subsidiary financing \nagreement, it will pay the undrawn amounts, including SSC, to the MOF, which will agree with \nADB  on  the  reallocation  of  these  funds  for  the  same  purpose  to  other  FIs.  After  project \ncompletion and final repayment of all subloans (whichever is later), the FI will pay the undrawn \ncash  collateral  portion,  repaid  SSC,  and  any  interest  incurred  on  the  amounts  into  an \nagribusiness finance account held with the MOF. An option paper prepared by ADB and the \ngovernment in year 3 will outline potential strategies for future use of these funds after the \nproject\u2019s lifetime.24 FIs will observe ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguard requirements in \nthe subborrower\u2019s due diligence process. \n  \n24.  Samoa\u2019s circumstances warrant allowing a portion of the grant proceeds to be passed \non  a  concessional  basis  to  the  FIs  and  to  eligible  subborrowers,  who  are  the  ultimate \nbeneficiaries.25 The  country  context  requires  long-term  engagement  and  an  acceptance  of \nhigher transaction costs (or lower fee income) to achieve anticipated outcomes. The financing \nconstraints, including lack of capital, and internal capacities make it challenging and expensive \nfor agribusinesses to grow. Additional fees would only increase their capital cost. The project \ndesign incorporates features that enhance sustainability, aims at recouping the investments at \nthe end of the project\u2019s lifetime, and stimulates future commercial banks\u2019 lending to the sector \n(footnote 8). Together with the government\u2019s commitment to recycle the grant proceeds beyond \nproject completion, sustainability of the grant benefits will be maximized.  \n \n25.  The terms of reference for the required key consulting positions are outlined in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).26 The total consulting inputs are currently estimated at 87 \nperson-months.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  under  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Additional consulting services, estimated at \n32 person-months, will be determined after the inception phase and business support services \nneeds for potential partner businesses have been identified. This consulting expertise will be \nrecruited following an indefinite delivery contract modality to allow flexibility in responding to the \nneeds  during  implementation.  Procurement  of  goods  and  works  will  be  conducted  under \nprovisions of para. 3.12 of ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \nThe agribusiness innovation scheme will be administered by the PMU and is further detailed in \nthe PAM. The project will be implemented over 7 years. Table 3 summarizes and the PAM \ndetails the implementation arrangements.  \n                                                                                                                                                       \ninterest accrued on such amounts upon project completion. There will be no commitment fee charged to the \nfinancial intermediary. \n22 The term accommodates a phased approach and enables longer-term equipment financing. \n23 Further description on use of funds can be found in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Through this hands-on approach, it is anticipated that default rates will remain below current default rates. \n25 ADB. 2013.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical  \n26.  All activities to be implemented were subject to detailed technical design, feasibility \nassessment, and costing after options, approaches, and lessons from similar initiatives were \nconsidered.  A  sector  assessment  provided  the  rationale  and  identified  some  high-level \nconstraints. Value chain analyses and investment profiles assessed the technical aspects of \nactual and potential agribusiness investments and identified the bottlenecks to be addressed \nwithin  value  chains.  The  analyses  confirmed  that  Samoa  has  a  sustainable  comparative \nadvantage  in  some  export-based  agribusinesses,  especially  those  where  Samoa  formerly \ndominated (e.g., taro). It also highlighted the need for supply chain development to ensure \nconstant raw material supply and for market access support. The agribusiness survey analyzed \nthe  agribusiness  sector\u2019s  structure  and  its  capabilities,  resources,  and  needs.  The  survey \nconfirmed the potential for expansion and/or diversification and identified systemic weaknesses. \nThe options analysis, combined with a review of lessons from other projects and initiatives in the \nAsia and the Pacific region, led to preferring an approach combining financing support with \nbusiness support services through the private sector. A climate risk screening was conducted \nthat considered the project to be at low risk. \n \n27.  ANZ Bank (Samoa) was identified as FI under the required eligibility criteria based on \ntheir  strategy,  financial  position  and  performance,  and  financial  management  systems.  An \nintegrity  due  diligence  was  conducted,  and  ANZ  Bank  (Samoa)  was  found  eligible  to \nparticipate.27 Detailed eligibility criteria for FI,28 subborrowers, and subprojects were established \nand  are  detailed  in  the  PAM  and  the  environmental  and  social  management  system \narrangement (ESMS).29   \n                                                \n27 Due Diligence on ANZ (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Economic and Financial  \n28.   The economic analysis identifies the project\u2019s benefits. 30 These include (i) increased \nagribusiness contribution to the Samoan economy, (ii) improved balance of trade, and (iii) \nincreased  rural  self-employment  opportunities  and  formal  employment  in  agro-processing \nenterprises. The project will select partners primarily  through the FI channel, but will also \nprioritize subprojects with broader rural development impacts through  creating employment \nopportunities or improving value chain integration and removing supply chain bottlenecks. \n \n29.  The  financial  analysis  (footnote  30)  demonstrates  that  the  project  is  expected  to \ngenerate positive and sustainable financial returns to the participants, which averaged 20% for \nthe 3 investment profiles. The investment profiles (footnote 7) show examples of agribusinesses \nthat can mostly generate reasonable financial returns for the investor, but only after an initial \nperiod of losses due to purchase of equipment. Such ventures will be funded by combining the \nowner\u2019s equity and debt, with debt comprising up to 50% of the financing package. Partner \nenterprises will benefit from lower interest rates related to the cash collateral arrangements. \n \n30.  The  beneficiaries  will  include  the  shareholders  of  partner  businesses  and  their \nemployees,  suppliers,  and  contractors.  Many  farmers  are  expected  to  benefit  through \nparticipation  in  structured  arrangements for supplying  agro-industrial  raw  materials.  Project \nimpacts will be direct for agribusinesses that participate in partnerships to grow their businesses \nand create market and employment opportunities for other beneficiaries. The impacts will be \nindirect  but  significant for  poor  and  vulnerable groups,  with  likely  cumulative  medium-term \nbenefits such as increasing market opportunities to grow and sell produce, and increasing \nopportunities for formal employment in agro-industries.  \n \n31.  The economic analysis shows that the economic internal rate of return would be about \n21%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the overall project is relatively robust to changes in \nthe level of costs and benefits. In general, the economic internal rate of return is more sensitive \nto delays in benefits rather than costs and benefits being greater or lesser than expected, with \nthe overall project return falling just below 12% if benefits are delayed a year. The economic \nanalysis indicates that the benefits justify the costs of the overall investment project. All project \ncomponents are necessary for delivering the expected results through mutual reinforcement, \nand none of them can be considered a stand-alone investment.  \n \nC.  Governance \n32.  The project features important design elements to support good governance and ensure \naccountability and transparency by implementing the project within the ESMS framework in \ncoordination with participating banks and the FM, and by adopting well-defined (i) beneficiary \neligibility  and  assessment  criteria;  (ii)  subproject  eligibility  and  finance  criteria;  and  (iii) \nprocesses  and  procedures  for  FIs\u2019  use  of  cash  collateral  mechanism  and  SSC,  including \nprocesses for borrower default. These criteria will be documented in the legal agreements and \nthe PAM. The MOF\u2019s financial management capacity, policies, and procedures as well as its \nprocurement capacity have been assessed as satisfactory.31 The FIs will be encouraged to \nrequire subborrowers to use economic and efficient private sector or commercial practices in \nprocurement. The PAM will be adhered to during implementation.  \n \n                                                \n30 Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  In accordance with: ADB. 2005.

ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 26). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n34.  The project design includes measures that promote inclusive businesses through the \ndevelopment of supply chain linkages and outgrower schemes. Besides formal job creation \nwithin the sector, the project will address poverty reduction by engaging many low-income \nfarmers. The project will comply with national labor laws and/or internationally recognized core \nlabor standards. The PMU will establish a monitoring system to track these indicators.32  \n \n35.  The project is classified as \u201ceffective gender mainstreaming.\u201d A gender action plan was \ndeveloped based on gender analysis and stakeholder consultations. In the formal economy, \nwomen  are  active  participants  in the  private  sector,  primarily  as  paid  employees.  A  small \nnumber of women are employed by agribusinesses.33 The gender action plan provides for the \nequitable participation of women in the project by ensuring that (i) businesses run by women will \nbe considered for financing based on a commercially viable business plan, (ii) women benefit \nfrom training activities to improve technical skills in business management and other areas, (iii) \nwomen gain from increased formal employment opportunities in agribusinesses, and (iv) the \nproject is managed and monitored with sensitivity to gender outcomes.  \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  Environment. The project has been classified as category FI following ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The ESMS of the likely participating bank has been assessed and \nfound acceptable. An ESMS was prepared for the project since the specific enterprises to be \nsupported by the project are unknown at this stage. Activities to be undertaken by partner \ncompanies under the project will be subject to environmental and social safeguard screening by \nthe FIs and, if required, assessment during evaluation of partnership proposals following the \nESMS. The ESMS establishes the process for compliance with safeguards and includes the \nmonitoring and reporting requirements. A safeguard specialist, who will assist the FM, will be \nengaged to work with potential partners.  \n  \n37.  Involuntary resettlement (IR) and indigenous peoples (IP). The project is classified \ncategory FI (treated as C) for IR and IP following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nThe project is not expected to involve physical displacement or involuntary acquisition of land. \nAny purchase or lease of freehold land or leasing of customary land for agricultural production \nwill be undertaken through voluntary agreements between private agribusiness enterprises and \nlandowners. The project is not expected to impact any distinct and vulnerable group of IP. The \nbeneficiaries in the project areas are part of mainstream Polynesian society. The outputs will be \nculturally appropriate. While the location of agribusinesses to be supported is unknown at this \nstage, the project\u2019s ESMS provides guidelines for screening and managing any unanticipated IP \nand IR impacts. The project will be treated as category C for IP and IR, and no activities will be \nundertaken that have any IR and/or adverse impact on distinct and vulnerable IP. \n                                                \n32  Procedures for monitoring the participation of poor and disadvantaged households will be detailed in the PAM and \nwill become part of the project monitoring and evaluation system. \n33  According to traditional Samoan values, women do not play a direct role in agricultural production, which is defined \nas a masculine activity. Increased employment or self-employment in agricultural production is therefore likely to be \nmainly male. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "10   \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The project risks have been assessed and the benefits are expected to outweigh the \ncosts. The project is considered complex because of the agriculture focus and the challenging \nsmall  island  context,  which  justified  the  modified  FI  channel  modality.  Efforts  have  been \nundertaken to identify potential risks and relevant mitigating measures, which are integrated into \nthe project design. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and detailed \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.34 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nAdverse weather or natural disasters disrupt raw material  Business plan to take account of possible disruptions, \nsupplies.   separate regional technical assistance to support on \nthose aspects. \nMalpractice or poor business performance of partner  Careful due diligence and assessment of business \ncompanies undermines commercial viability  plan  prior  to  support,  tailored  business  support \nservices and ongoing monitoring of facility manager. \nInconsistent raw material supply disrupts business process  Careful  constraints  analysis  during  due  diligence \nprocess.
