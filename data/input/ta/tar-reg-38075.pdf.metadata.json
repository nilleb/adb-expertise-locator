At the Second Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Summit Meeting in July 2005, the \nprime ministers of the six GMS countries, Cambodia, People's Republic of China (PRC), Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, reaffirmed their commitment \nto  the  shared  vision  of  an  integrated,  harmonious,  and  prosperous  subregion.  They \nacknowledged  the  success  in  achieving  a  more  integrated,  focused,  and  policy-oriented \ncooperation process; the stronger partnership among member countries and other stakeholders; \nand  improvements  resulting  from  a  wide  range  of  specific  projects  and  activities.  While \nrecognizing the substantial progress of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program (the GMS \nProgram)  over  the  last  13  years,  the  leaders  noted  that  increasingly  complex  challenges \nconfronted the GMS, including environmental degradation, communicable diseases, and the \ngrowing  threats  of  cross-border  crimes,  such  as  human  trafficking  and  drug  smuggling.1 \nEffectively addressing these challenges will require a greater focus on actions and results on \nthe ground, strengthening the collaboration efforts among the GMS countries, and establishing \nmechanisms that engender well-coordinated responses to issues.  \n \n2.  The GMS heads of governments cited the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) unique role \nas lead coordinator, facilitator, and catalyst of the GMS Program. Recognizing the enormity of \nthe tasks ahead, the leaders urged ADB to play an even larger role in bringing GMS to the \ncenter  stage  of  economic  integration  in  Asia  by  mobilizing  higher  levels  of  resource  and \nknowledge  transfers.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  enable  ADB  to  support  expanded \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  initiatives  and  activities,  including  accelerating  the \nimplementation of the strategies and work programs of the various subregional working groups \nand  forums.  To  this  end,  ADB  will  introduce  stronger  and  more  effective  results-based \nmanagement  into  the  GMS  Program  and  adopt  a  coherent  approach  to  measuring  and \nmonitoring development results. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  GMS  is  one  of  the  world\u2019s  fastest  growing  and  Asia\u2019s  most  rapidly  integrating \nsubregions. In 2004, despite prolonged droughts, escalating oil prices, and the threat of avian \ninfluenza, real gross domestic product grew at over 6% in each of the six GMS countries. \nGrowth has been broad-based, complemented by market-oriented reforms that have led to \nrapidly expanding trade. Over the last 13 years, total exports of GMS countries increased by \nmore than 16% per annum, while intraregional exports expanded at over 22% per annum.  \n \n4.  Despite the clear gains in trade and investment and rapid economic growth, in absolute \nterms poverty remains pervasive in the subregion, with large numbers still living in severe \npoverty.2 At the 13th GMS Ministerial Meeting (13th MM) in December 2004, the ministers agreed \nthat, to accelerate poverty reduction and further stimulate growth, GMS needs to step up the \nmomentum of the GMS Program. The ministers therefore asked ADB and the GMS Program\u2019s \nstakeholders to optimize the use of limited resources, aim for greater impact, and accelerate the \nattainment of the GMS Program\u2019s goals. The ministers also adopted a GMS plan of action, \nwhich was also circulated in early 2005 as part of the Board information paper on the 13th MM.3 \n                                                  \n1  The Board Information Paper on the Second GMS Summit (IN.204-05) was circulated on 9 August 2005. \n2  Poverty prevalence (based on national poverty lines) has fallen significantly in most countries: Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic (Lao PDR), from 46% in 1993 to 32.7% in 2003; Thailand, from 23.2% in 1992 to 9.8% in \n2002; People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), from 9.4% in 1990 to 2.8% in 2004; and Viet Nam, from 58% in 1993 to \n29% in 2002. However, about 18 million people still lived on $1 a day in 2002 in Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam; in the PRC, the number was 203 million in 2002 (similar data are not available for Yunnan and \nGuangxi provinces of the PRC or for Myanmar).    \n3  The Board Information Paper on the 13th MM (IN.31-05) was circulated on 9 February 2005. ", "2     \nA similar effort to present the GMS Program\u2019s results framework has likewise been included as \nan appendix to the GMS regional cooperation strategy and program update (2006\u20132008).4 \n \n5.  At the GMS Summit in 2002, the GMS Program was endorsed at the highest political \nlevel, thus adding impetus to the implementation of regional development projects and activities. \nSince  then,  the  GMS  countries  have  been  assuming  increased  ownership  and  strategic \nleadership in the GMS Program, as reflected, for instance, in the increasing willingness of the \nmore  developed  members  to  fund  development  activities  beyond  their  own  borders.  The \nSecond GMS Summit (Kunming, PRC, 4\u20135 July 2005) created an even stronger demand for \ngreater dynamism in the GMS Program, not only to ensure its sustained momentum but also the \nequitable  distribution  of  its  benefits.  There  is  therefore a  need  to adopt  a  more  proactive \napproach in defining and implementing the GMS Program, using a clear and analytic framework \nthat can determine and measure results. Such a framework will also allow better design and \nfocusing of interventions and more efficient allocation of resources.5   \n \n6.  The  development  needs  of  GMS  are  growing  more  quickly  than  the  resources  to \nrespond to them. To bridge the resource gap, over the past 2 years ADB has succeeded in \nencouraging a larger number of development partners to increase their engagement as active \nstakeholders in the GMS. However, these development partnerships are mostly in the public \nsector. The crucial role of the private sector in achieving the shared vision of the GMS and in \nleveraging investment flows into the subregion was emphasized at both the 13th MM and at the \nSecond GMS Summit. Therefore, the focus now needs to be on the potential resources that the \nprivate  sector  can  provide.  Strengthening  public\u2013private  sector  partnerships  needs  to  be \nundertaken concurrently with improving the policy and regulatory framework for private sector \ninvestments. As part of this effort, the GMS countries will need to address the private sector\u2019s \nperception of the risks associated with investing in the emerging markets of the GMS. The GMS \nBusiness Forum will also continue to play an important role in this regard. \n \n7.  The increasing number of development partners in the GMS Program, particularly since \nthe first Development Partners Meeting held in tandem with the 12th Ministerial Conference in \n2003, is a welcome trend. However, this also brings to the fore the issue of the convergence of \ntheir assistance strategies with the GMS Program\u2019s strategic thrusts. Initial analysis shows that \nthere is substantial room improving the balance of development partners\u2019 efforts for maximum \nimpact. ADB, as the GMS Program\u2019s lead development partner, will need to coordinate its \npartners\u2019 work more effectively.  \n \n8.  The need for a timely response to emerging issues with a substantial subregional or \ntransboundary impact is increasing, particularly in light of the thrust of the second GMS Summit \nto  deepen  subregional  cooperation  in  infrastructure,  trade  and  investment,  and  social \ndevelopment. Given the increasing importance of threats from transboundary issues, such as \ncommunicable human and animal diseases, natural disasters, illegal trafficking of people, and \nother transnational crimes, there is a continuing need for GMS to be able to assess emerging \nproblems rapidly and propose timely solutions.  \n \n9.  The growing complexity of the issues addressed under the GMS cooperation program \nrequires  broader  participation  by  the  different  sector  agencies  that  manage  national  and \nsubregional responses to them. However, the institutional capacity within GMS countries is not \nyet adequate. Continued ADB assistance is needed to strengthen national and subregional \n                                                  \n4  The GMS RCSPU (2006\u20132008) (Sec.M61-05) was circulated to the Board on 9 August 2005. \n5  Although the impact evaluation study conducted in 1999\u20132000 provides a good start for this effort, steps are \nrequired to develop a more comprehensive and systematic approach to managing for development results. ", "      3\ncoordination  mechanisms,  taking  into  consideration  individual  country  capacities  and \ncircumstances.  \n \n10.  To mobilize the larger number of stakeholders in the GMS high-quality information needs \nto be disseminated more efficiently. This will become more complicated as the type and level of \nactivities in GMS increases, generating more complex and larger volumes of information for a \nmore diversified audience. A more structured effort will be required in the preparation, target \ndefinition and dissemination of information, as well as in obtaining feedback from stakeholders.  \n \n11.  Recognizing the new challenges that need to be overcome to realize the subregion\u2019s \nvast potential, the Second GMS Summit identified the following key areas: (i) reinforcing cross-\nborder infrastructure, (ii) improving the trade and investment environment, (iii) strengthening the \nsocial  and  environmental  infrastructure,  and  (iv)  mobilizing  resources  and  deepening \npartnerships. Critical milestones in each area have been set to ensure that, by the time of the \nThird GMS Summit in 2008, sound progress toward the long-term goals has been made. \nConsiderable work is required over the next 3 years to ensure that actions are coordinated and \nfocused on intended results. Programming of ADB assistance, including this GMS management \nsupport TA, needs to coincide with this critical period.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The intended impact of the TA is to sustain and accelerate the realization of benefits \nfrom subregional projects and initiatives. The envisaged outcome of the TA is an improvement \nin the results orientation of the GMS Program through a strengthening of results management in \nits institutions and mechanisms and timely provision of assistance in terms of resources and \nknowledge inputs for the expanding regional cooperation and integration initiative. The TA \noutcome will be achieved through the delivery of the following outputs: (i) establishment of a \nformal and quantitative impact evaluation and monitoring framework for the GMS Program, \n(ii) preparation of work programs for GMS Program institutional structures that are focused on a \nclear and manageable set of priorities, (iii) strengthened capacity for rapid assessment and \ntimely response to emerging subregional developments and issues, (iv) identification of projects \nin  key  sectors  with  potential  for  private  sector  investment,  (v)  stronger  mobilization  and \ncoordination of development partners to support the GMS Program, (vi) enhanced coordination \ncapacity of the GMS national secretariats, and (vii) an improved and well-managed information \ndissemination services system.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  Increasing Focus on Results. The work programs of the various GMS subregional \nworking groups will be reviewed, in order to enhance their results focus. To guide the review, an \nimpact monitoring and evaluation framework for activities and initiatives will be formulated. Part \nof this framework will be the establishment of specific and quantifiable performance indicators to \nallow for the effective monitoring of progress of the GMS flagship programs. The framework will \nimprove the development effectiveness of the GMS Program, enabling a rational reprioritization \nand sharper focusing of its activities so that greater and earlier impacts are achieved. Extensive \nconsultations with the countries and other stakeholders will be carried out during the formulation \nof the framework and the review of the subregional working group work programs. These efforts \nwill be guided by some of the basic principles on GMS cooperation set by the Second GMS \nSummit, particularly the principles of equality and mutual respect among the GMS members, of ", "4     \ninclusiveness and consensus building, and of pragmatism and an outward looking orientation, \nfocusing on action and results.   \n \n14.  Strengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships. The growing development needs of the \nGMS  and  the  limited  resources  of  the  governments  and  official  development  agencies \nnecessitate more active participation by the private sector in GMS activities. Good progress has \nbeen made in engaging the private sector in the GMS Program through the GMS Business \nForum. However, more needs to be done to draw private financial resources to GMS initiatives \nand to replicate the successful public\u2013private partnerships already achieved in the energy \nsector. In this respect, as a result of the Mekong Development Forum (MDF) held in Tokyo in \nJuly 2005, a study will be undertaken to (i) identify sectors where public\u2013private partnerships will \nbe most beneficial, (ii) identify key issues and risks associated with private sector investments in \nGMS, and (iii) formulate measures to induce private sector participation in identified projects. \nADB will help the GMS countries to identify a priority list of potentially commercially viable \nprojects with subregional dimensions to jump-start the process. The study will complement the \nactivities of the GMS Business Forum and the subregional working groups concerned with \npromoting investments in the GMS. \n \n15.  Increasing Coordination. Public sector development partners of GMS provide the bulk \nof development assistance to GMS countries. Coordination of these activities has improved \nsignificantly recently. The donor coordination by the GMS working group on environment of the \ncore environment program (CEP) is a good example. The CEP components have been grouped \ninto  manageable  technical  assistance  subprojects  in  which  development  partners  can \nparticipate, depending on their respective priorities, resources, and comparative advantage. \nADB\u2019s monitoring of development partner activities will be enhanced and updated and it will use \na database by ADB to identify more effectively the sectors of interest of the development \npartners, and the scope, extent, and specific nature of their assistance. The GMS development \nmatrix  will  be  reviewed,  updated,  and  upgraded.  Areas  for  increased  coordination  and \ncollaboration with other cooperation initiatives in the region, e.g., Ayeyawaddy - Chao Phraya \nEconomic  Cooperation  Strategy  (ACMECS),  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Countries \n(ASEAN),  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  Multi-sector  Technical  and  Economic  Cooperation \n(BIMSTEC), will be sought and developed. \n \n16.  Enhancing  Responsiveness.  Because  of  the  rapid  growth  of  the  individual  GMS \neconomies  and  the  success  of  the  GMS  Program,  the  social  and  economic  landscape  is \nchanging quickly. To remain effective, the GMS Program must be able to respond to these \nchanges  and  to  provide  issue-specific  and  results-oriented  recommendations  in  a  timely \nmanner. The TA therefore provides for the engagement of experts to assess a given situation \nand propose a coordinated response in consultation with relevant stakeholders in the GMS.  \n \n17.  Building the Capacity of the GMS National Secretariats. As the GMS Program grows \nin breadth and depth, development issues affecting the subregion are becoming more complex \nand often require cross-sectoral responses, beginning at the national level. The secretariats of \nthe GMS national coordinators need to evolve if they are to remain relevant and effective. Under \nthe TA, it is therefore proposed that ADB provide assistance to the national coordinators and \nline agencies to identify and implement effective in-country coordination mechanisms, taking \ninto consideration national circumstances. Capacity-building plans will be prepared. ADB will \nbegin preparing modules to address anticipated common training needs, e.g., principles of \nregional cooperation in the GMS; program coordination, implementation, and monitoring skills; \nand sectoral cooperation strategies. \n ", "      5\n18.  Strengthening Information Dissemination and Awareness. The MDF in Paris in June \n2004 demonstrated that effective information dissemination and awareness campaigns could \nhave very beneficial flow-on effects in the GMS. As a result of the MDF, more European \ndevelopment partners are now involved in the Greater Mekong countries and in the GMS \nProgram.  The  GMS  Program  will  continue  to  organize  MDFs  and  to  conduct  systematic \ninformation dissemination via the web and other media, thereby improving the effectiveness of \nits outreach activities to civil society. It will also tap into new networks of subregional interaction, \nsuch as the GMS Youth Forum, to enhance awareness of the GMS Program and its activities \nand form closer links with GMS partners.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $3,125,000  equivalent,  comprising  $2,500,000  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and $625,000 equivalent in kind, to be \nprovided by the participating GMS governments, including contributions for hosting MMs, senior \nofficials meetings (SOMs), and working group meetings.  The cost estimates and financing plan \nfor the TA are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the Executing Agency responsible for implementing and monitoring the TA \nin consultation with the GMS governments. GMS national secretariats will be focal points for \ncoordinating subregional activities in each member country. \n \n21.  The TA will finance about 214 person-months of consultant services\u201487 international \nand  127  domestic.  A  core  group  of  consultants  will  provide  advisory,  technical,  and \nadministrative support services to assist in the overall management of the GMS Program. \nConsultants for private sector development, and for communications and media affairs, as well \nas short-term consultants to conduct special studies will also be engaged. The consultants will \nbe hired as individuals. They will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 28 months, from October 2005 to January 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n23.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,500,000 on a grant basis for Enhancing the Development \nEffectiveness of the Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1     \n     \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and  \nRisks \nImpact       \nRealization of benefits  Increased number and  \u2022  Progress reports to the MM  Assumption \nfrom subregional projects  measured impact of GMS  Political stability and \nannually and to the SOM at \nand initiatives accelerated   projects and initiatives in the  mutual trust will continue \nleast twice yearly  \n  next 5 years compared with  to exist among GMS \n\u2022  Contents of joint ministerial \nthose in the previous 5 years   member countries \nstatements and joint summit \n \ndeclarations \nOutcome       \nResults-orientation of the  \u2022  Plans and work programs of  \u2022  Plans and work programs  Risk \nGMS Program institutions  GMS institutions (MM,  produced by the GMS  Certain GMS working \nand mechanisms  SOM, working  institutions annually  groups and member \nenhanced  groups/forums) that are  \u2022  Plan and program  country governments may \n  clear and consistent with  monitoring reports;  find it difficult to give up \nthe MfDR framework   progress reports to the  certain projects, even if \n\u2022  Absence of or low negative  SOM at least twice yearly  these are found to be \nvariances between actual  inconsistent or irrelevant \nperformance and such  to intended results of the \nplans and work programs\u2019  GMS Program \ntargets and timelines \n \nOutputs       \n 1.
