The Government of India requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA)1 for preparing a rural finance (RF)2 project for reforming rural finance \ninstitutions (RFIs) to enhance their poverty reduction and income expansion contributions. \nAccordingly, the Country Strategy and Program for 2003 includes a TA for preparing the Rural \nFinance Sector Restructuring and Development Project. A TA fact-finding mission visited India \nin February 2003, and held discussions with the federal and state governments, central bank, \napex agencies, RFIs, and other stakeholders including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nand  bilateral  funding  agencies.  This  report  reflects  the  findings  of  the  mission  and  the \nunderstanding  reached  with  the  Government  on  objectives,  scope,  cost,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In recent years, India has made significant progress in reducing poverty. The absolute \nnumber of poor declined significantly in the second half of the 1990s, from 320 million to 260 \nmillion, and poverty incidence has declined from 36% in 1993\u20131994 to 26% in 1999\u20132001. \nSeven of the 30 states have a poverty incidence of below 10%. However, regional disparities \nremain  pronounced  and  inequalities  exist  between  population  groups  even  within  states. \nInequalities have also increased between rural and urban areas, with 75% of the poor living in \nrural areas. Poverty reduction is thus the overarching goal of the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002\u2013\n2007). The aim is to reduce poverty incidence by five percentage points by 2007 through \nemphasis on the employment-intensive rural development and agriculture sectors. \n \n3.  In response to rural poverty in a predominantly agricultural economy, the RF paradigm in \nIndia over the last five decades has been driven by credit expansion through RFIs and targeted \nprograms for priority sectors. This helped establish a largely state-owned RF system with one \noutlet for approximately every 5,000 population. At the aggregate level there are nearly 85 \nmillion rural borrowers as against 300 million rural savers, including those who save at post \noffices. RF is credited with contributing to agricultural growth leading to food self-sufficiency and \na food surplus, as well as to poverty reduction and employment generation.  \n \n4.  The widely dispersed formal RF sector consists of 32,637 rural and semiurban branches \nof commercial banks; 196 regional rural banks (RRBs) with 14,465 branches; and the provincial \nshort-term  and  long-term  cooperative  credit  structures  (CCSs)  with  94,663  outlets.  While \ncommercial banks and RRBs are subject to Reserve Bank of India (RBI, the central bank) \nsupervision, the CCS are supervised by both RBI and provincial governments. The semiformal \nsector includes about 500 microfinance institutions (MFIs)3 and the nation-wide Swarnajayanti \nGram Swarozgar Yojana (SGSY).4 Noninstitutional or informal sources, supplying nearly one-\nthird of the RF services, comprise traders, moneylenders, landlords, relatives, and friends. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 January 2003.  \n2  In this document, the scope of RF includes savings, credit, payment services, insurance, and commodity trading. \nFrom the client\u2019s perspective, RF can be classified as financial services provided to rural farm and nonfarm \nhouseholds, a large proportion of whom are poor and low-income households. Microfinance (MF), as an RF \nsubset, targets the poor. While RFIs also serve the poor, low-income households, and the nonpoor, microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) exclusively focus on the poor. MF is primarily rural, even though MFIs also target the urban \npoor. In this document, the terms \u201cRF\u201d and \u201cRFI\u201d include \u201cMF\u201d and \u201cMFI\u201d, respectively. The terms \u201cMF\u201d and \u201cMFI\u201d \nare used only for specific MF-related references. \n3  Registered under the Societies Registration Act, or Cooperative Societies Act, or are nonbank finance companies.  \n4  SGSY or Golden Jubilee Rural Self-Employment Scheme is a holistic program that provides credit and subsidy-\nfinanced assets to groups of poor or self-help groups, along with skills development and marketing support.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), the main apex RF \nagency, provides refinance and technical support to RFIs and commercial banks. The Small \nIndustrial Development Bank of India and Rashtriya Mahila Kosh, an apex MF agency, provide \nequity and refinance support to MFIs. Linkages between commercial banks, RFIs, MFIs, NGOs, \nand self-help groups augment the retail capacity aimed at the lower segment of the RF market \ncomprising the landless poor, subsistence farmers, and microenterprises. \n \n6.  The substantial RF network is accompanied by systemic policy issues and pervasive \ninstitutional weaknesses. Government interventions through directed credit, state-owned RFIs, \nand subsidized interest rates gradually increased the tolerance for loan defaults, waivers, and \npostponements. Lack of autonomy and weak governance have affected sustainability of RFIs \nand constrained outreach. This, among others, impedes diversification to nonfarm activities for \nsupporting value addition and employment generation. Further, the risks in RF due to droughts \nand floods are accentuated by the weak rural infrastructure and by production and marketing \nbottlenecks. The resulting low prices, productivity, and profitability make it difficult for the rural \nsector to compete for capital with urban areas. Rural credit is only 10% of total commercial bank \nadvances. Thus, a demand and supply gap exists, despite the extensive RF network. The rural \npoor and women, in particular, have inadequate access to RF services. \n \n7.  CCSs are usually poorly governed and politicized institutions with inadequate capital and \nhigh levels of loan delinquency. CCS in many states operate due to regulatory forbearance and \noutmoded accounting concepts. In addition, the RRBs have drifted from their core objective of \nbanking with the poor and have accumulated overheads without regard to efficiency. With \naggregate repayment rate at 70% of demand, the portfolio quality of RRBs remains dubious. \nConcerned at the magnitude of these issues, the Government is considering to reform the CCSs \nand RRBs through good governance, re-capitalization, and reduction in nonperforming loans.  \n \n8.  Over the years, bilateral funding assistance for MF development  has introduced best \npractices. The commercial banks and RFIs use self-help groups organized and trained through \nintermediary NGOs for delivery of MF services. While this reduces transaction and risk costs, \nthe arrangement provides little scope for voluntary savings and risk mitigation. The amount of \ncredit is often less than the investment cost for supporting income-generating activities. The \nstatus of many MFIs to undertake savings remains unclear, which discourages investment in \ninstitutional capacity and consequently affects outreach to the poor. MFIs also exhibit wide \nvariations in scale and efficiencies. Currently, a task force of the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and \nsub-committees of RBI are working on measures for enhancing MF outreach.  \n \n9.  The disadvantages that the rural poor face due to limited access to RF are accentuated \nby the inadequacy of risk-mitigating instruments to insure against default risks, for instance, due \nto property loss or illness. As a result, the poor forgo potentially viable new technologies, \nproduction choices, and income opportunities due to risk aversion. So far, insurance services \nare not widespread in rural areas because of scant client information to assess risks, weak \ncontract enforcement, and high transaction costs. Establishment of an insurance company for \nthe agriculture sector is being considered by the Government to address some of these issues. \n \n10.  For  rural  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  it  is  important  that  producers  receive \nremunerative prices on time. However, production and price volatility due to dependence on the \nmonsoon and poor price discovery affect farm profitability and raise the default risks for RFIs. \nThe  commodity  markets  that  can  help  reduce  such  price  volatility  remain  segmented \ncommodity-wise and regionally. In addition, the spot and forward markets in commodities are \nnot integrated. Responding to these concerns, a National Multi-Commodity Exchange has been \n ", "3 \nset up and effective market regulation is being considered. The entire downstream system will \nrequire significant strengthening for enhancing the participation of small rural producers. \n \n11.  The RF problems in India remain rooted in weak governance, inadequate autonomy of \nRFIs, and political interference in loan collection. Perpetually weak RFIs overshadow positive \nimpacts of savings and credit expansion. In addition, direct poverty interventions are beset by \nproblems of beneficiary identification, leakages, and few sustained benefits. Central and state \ngovernments realize the need for reforming the RF system for ensuring sustainability and pro-\npoor orientation. Properly governed RFIs are considered necessary for equitable participation in \nlocal economy for rural poor and employment generation in farm and nonfarm sectors through \nincreased access to affordable RF services. There is a growing realization that the poverty \nreduction impact of RF can be maximized if price and production risks are mitigated. Success in \nthese interventions will facilitate the realization of the poverty reduction goal set for in the Tenth \nFive-Year Plan, which is consistent with the ADB country strategy for India.5 \n \n12.  RF is already moving into a transition. Task forces of the Government are formulating \nRF  reform  frameworks.  This  project  preparatory  TA  will  provide  appropriate  inputs  for \ncontributing to policy and institutional reforms for pro-poor banking; strengthening governance \nand regulation of RFIs; and enhancing risk mitigation measures. ADB\u2019s significant experience in \nRF and its MF development strategy6 will enable lessons to be drawn from a number of \ncountries in Asia. Further, the findings of the poverty assessment and the study on improving \nthe poverty reduction impact of the financial system in India will also feed into the TA.7 The TA \nwill help build a long-term relationship between the Government and ADB for RF development. \nLinkages with key sector institutions and other funding agencies will be established.  \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The main purpose of the TA is to prepare an RF project, in support of the Government\u2019s \nreform agenda for RF and suitable for ADB financing, for rural poverty reduction and income \nexpansion through increased access to sustainable RF services. The TA will develop and \nprioritize reform opportunities based on in-depth review and analysis of the following. \n \n(i)  CCSs and RRBs. Financial and institutional status of and restructuring options \nfor CCSs and RRBs in five states;8 and the role of state governments, apex \nagencies, and sponsoring banks in policy, supervisory, and operational aspects. \n \n(ii)  MF.  Status  of  MF  policy,  legal  framework,  governance,  supervision,  and \nsustainability; delivery models for outreach expansion; resource needs; pilots for \nproduct  and  process  innovations;  delivery  options  for  social  intermediation \nservices; and the role and participation of the private sector in MF. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

States will be selected \nby the executing agency in consultation with ADB.  ", "4   \n(iii)  Risk Mitigation. Options, products, and financial derivatives for risk mitigation \nand the possibility of service delivery through poverty reduction programs, RFIs, \nand  MFIs;  and  the  agriculture  insurance  sector,  including  scope  for  policy, \nproduct, and institutional support for the proposed agriculture insurance agency.  \n(iv)  Commodity  Markets.  Policy  and  institutional  framework  for  strengthening \ncommodity  futures  market  including  regulation  and  supervision,  downstream \nproducts and services, and information dissemination needs.  \n \n(v)  Sector  Support.  Operational  status  of  NABARD,  including  the  need  for \nonlending resource support; training arrangements for RFIs; and RFI monitoring. \n \n14.  The five component outputs will be subsector frameworks with options for policy and \ninstitutional support. A project proposal will be developed in consultation with the Government \nfrom these options for the delivery of affordable RF services, especially to the rural poor and \nwomen. A summary poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n15.  The TA will link up with the substantial RF sector work by the Government, bilateral \nfunding agencies, and others in formulating policy and institutional reforms. This will enable \nstakeholder participation from the outset and eliminate duplication. The TA inputs will facilitate \ndevelopment of a reform agenda, strategic priorities, and implementation plans. The outputs will \nthus provide options for the proposed RF project as well as for other funding agencies and for \nimplementation  by  the  Government.  The  modular  TA  plan  will  allow  (i)  subsector-wise \nidentification of sustainable design elements for enhancing the poverty reduction impact, and (ii) \ninclusive stakeholder consultations for successively prioritizing TA outputs for ensuring pro-poor \norientation  of  the  ensuing  project  design.  Accordingly,  the  team  of  experts  will  include \nspecialists in social and poverty analysis, social intermediation, risk mitigation, and community \ndevelopment.  International  expertise  will  be  selectively  used  for  incorporation  of  best \ninternational practices. TA implementation will allow flexibility to adapt team compositions as the \nwork progresses. Appropriate methodologies will be applied for participation of the poor and for \ncapturing their perspectives identified by previous studies (footnote 7). The draft reports will be \ndiscussed at the national and state levels prior to finalization. For wider dissemination and \nparticipation, draft TA outputs will be posted on the web site of NABARD. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, consisting of $255,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $995,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government of the \nUnited Kingdom will finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $745,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost on a grant basis. The Government will finance the remaining local currency cost \nof $250,000 equivalent in kind including office space, counterpart staff, local transport, other \nadministrative expenses, and part of the cost of workshops and surveys. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Ministry of Finance, Department of Economic Affairs (Banking Division) will be the \nExecuting Agency (EA) for the TA. For TA implementation, the EA will form a TA management \ncommittee comprising representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperation; Ministry \n ", "5 \nof  Consumer  Affairs,  Food  and  Public  Distribution;  RBI;  NABARD;  and  selected  state \ngovernments, CCSs, RRBs, MFIs, NGOs, etc. The TA management committee, through its \nchairperson designate, will be responsible for overall implementation. NABARD, on behalf of the \nEA, will implement and coordinate the studies, analysis, and outputs under the TA. It will provide \nsuitable office space, two full-time counterpart staff, and support services at its head office. \nNABARD will also provide office space at its state and district offices and seek similar facilities \nfrom the CCSs and RRBs to enable the consultants to accomplish their task.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 7 months, beginning in January 2004 and \ncompleted by July 2004. Tripartite review meetings involving the Government, TA consultant, \nand ADB will be organized by the EA twice during the TA period, to be held in conjunction with \nADB missions to review implementation and resolve any outstanding issues. The Ministry of \nFinance  will  chair  the  meetings.  Members  of  the  TA  management  committee  and \nrepresentatives  of  other  agencies  as  decided  by  the  EA  will  attend  the  meetings.  The \nGovernment will undertake a final evaluation of the TA jointly with ADB, on the basis of the final \ndraft report of the TA.  \n \n19.  The  consulting  services  required  under  the  TA  consist  of  10  person-months  of \ninternational and 135 person-months of domestic consulting services. Terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 4. The RF and MF sector specialist (domestic) will be the \nteam leader and will be assisted by a deputy team leader (international), financial analyst, and \nsocial and poverty specialist for coordination and consolidation of the outputs of the teams of \nexperts constituted for the five TA components. Consulting services will be provided by an \ninternational consulting firm, which will provide both international and domestic consultants. The \nTA consultant will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. For selecting the consulting firm, the quality and cost-based selection method, with \nsimplified technical proposals, will be used. \n \n20.  The TA consultant will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work program, \nto be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial tripartite \nreview meeting; (ii) quarterly progress reports for reporting overall work progress during the \nperiod under review, the work program for the following quarter, and any outstanding issues; (iii) \nan interim report, presenting draft outputs to be submitted within 5 months of the start of the TA, \nand to be discussed at the interim tripartite review meeting; (iv) a draft final report compiling all \nTA activities and consultants\u2019 recommendations, to be submitted at least 1 month before TA \ncompletion and to be discussed at the final tripartite review meeting; and (v) a final report at the \ncompletion  of  the  TA.  The  TA  consultant  will  organize  and  conduct  workshops  to  obtain \nstakeholder views on TA activities and outputs, and undertake surveys on an as-needed basis.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom \nfor preparing the Rural Finance Sector Restructuring and Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Measurable  Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nSector Goal       \n       \nAccelerate and enhance  Comprehensive policy,  TA Steering Committee  Government's \npoverty reduction and income  governance, regulatory,  meetings, Tripartite  commitment to \nexpansion through policy and  and institutional  review meetings, and  pursue reforms that \ninstitutional reforms in rural  strengthening framework  reports submitted by TA  enables RF sector to \nfinance (RF) sector to  identified for rural finance  consultant.   operate \nenhance the access of a  institutions (RFIs)    autonomously within \nbroad range of RF services,    a liberalized \nespecially for the rural poor   Reforms for  financial policy \nmainstreaming risk  regime \nmitigation and enhancing   \nthe effectiveness of \ncommodity futures market \nidentified  \n \nPurposes        \n       \nPrepare a project for Asian  By the end of Technical  TA Steering Committee  Continued focus on \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)  Assistance (TA), sub- meetings, Tripartite  poverty reduction in \nfinancing to initiate RF sector  sector wise-reform  review meetings, and  the rural sector in \nreforms for increasing the  proposals prepared and  reports submitted by TA  the Government\u2019s \naccess to sustainable RF  implementation plans  consultant.

Linkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \n \nSector identified as a national priority in  Sector identified as a national priority in Country \nCountry Poverty Analysis?  Yes  Poverty Partnership Agreement (PPA)? No PPA to \n  date.  \nContribution of the sector/sub sector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nIndia is a predominantly rural economy. Nearly three fourths of the total population and the majority of the country\u2019s \n260 million poor are in rural areas. Intensity of poverty is higher among marginal farmers and landless rural laborers. \nNatural disasters such as droughts and floods and volatility of agricultural prices accentuate rural poverty. Inadequate \naccess to affordable rural finance (RF) services constrains rural growth and employment. Weak RF markets depress \nthe rate of rural economic growth and distort its income distribution consequences. The development of a sustainable \nRF sector with improved governance and risk mitigation mechanisms will reduce the vulnerability of the rural poor. \nThe  Project  will  promote  rural  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction,  through  (i) income  and  employment \ngeneration in the rural sector; (ii) increased productivity of agricultural activities; (iii) private sector promotion, \nespecially among small and microenterprises; and (iv) social protection and empowerment.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Improved Governance/ Economic Development \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nTwo thirds of India's population depend on agriculture for their livelihood. However, the majority of farmers are \nclassified as subsistence farmers and many agricultural households live below the poverty line. In terms of \nnonincome aspects of poverty such as the literacy rate, India has some of the lowest human development indicators \nin Asia, particularly in rural areas. Government poverty reduction programs have had limited impact because of \nineffective targeting and leakages. Thus, the focus areas for the poverty analysis are (i) poverty assessment and \nmapping of the poor and vulnerable who are unable to access RF services, (ii) stocktaking of tangible and intangible \nproductive assets of the rural poor for determining appropriate types of RF services, (iii) identifying constraints in \nenhancing access to RF services, and (iv) assessing the need for social intermediation support for developing skills \nthat could be useful for generating higher returns for the rural poor from investments in income-generating activities. \n \nIndia's agricultural productivity is low by international standards. A large share of public investment in agriculture is \ndirected to subsidies for food, irrigation, fertilizer, electricity, and credit, which, in most cases, benefits large \nlandowners rather than small farmers due to the politicization of the subsidy programs and lack of effective targeting. \nSmallholders, who are the majority of farm households in India, have limited access to agricultural inputs such as \nirrigation, fertilizer, and high-quality seeds, partly due to limited access to affordable RF services. Less than one third \nof farmland is irrigated and agricultural output is heavily dependent on the annual monsoon, which makes farmers \nvulnerable to climatic variations. The introduction of high-yielding crop varieties and improved irrigation techniques \nover several decades have increased productivity in some areas. However, small landholders have not been able to \nafford these.  \n \nThe Government has initiated target group-oriented antipoverty programs since the 1960s. The major ongoing \nprograms include the Golden Jubilee Rural Self-employment Scheme, Jawahar Rural Development Scheme, and \nEmployment Assurance Scheme. These programs aim at higher productivity and sustainable income generation and \ninvolve subsidized credit or assets to poor households, often combined with improved technology or skill training. \nExperience, however, shows less than expected achievements, mainly due to the nonviability of, as well as \ninadequate investment in, many income-generating activities and insufficient technical and institutional capabilities in \nprogram implementation.  Further, subsidized credit generates excess demand, resulting in credit rationing and \ncapture by rural elites. Subsidized credit is perceived as a grant and encourages irregular repayment behavior.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis?  Yes \nThe social assessment of the TA will involve consultations with various stakeholders using qualitative and quantitative \nmethodologies. The focus of the social assessment will be on (i) cost effective RF delivery models and social \nintermediation services, especially to women; (ii) appropriate risk mitigation mechanisms for the rural poor; and \n(iii) impact of development of the commodity futures markets and agriculture insurance on small landholders. The \nsocial  assessment  will  involve  the  participation  of  the  following  main  stakeholders:  farm  and  nonfarm  rural \nhouseholds; nongovernment organizations and self-help groups; commercial banks; regional rural banks; cooperative \ncredit structure; formal and semiformal microfinance institutions; Ministry of Finance; provincial ministries and \n ", "          \nAppendix 2        9 \ncredit structure; formal and semiformal microfinance institutions; Ministry of Finance; provincial ministries and \ndepartments; National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development; Reserve Bank of India; Small Industries \nDevelopment Bank of India; National Cooperative Development Corporation; and selected bilateral agencies. \n \nParticipation strategy?  Yes \nThe key aim of the project is to address rural unemployment, low agricultural productivity, and vulnerability of the rural \npoor. Therefore, the emphasis of the social assessment will be on participatory process aimed at rural poor and \nmicrofinance institutions to assess their needs for enhancing sustainable outreach. The assessments will also involve \nconsultations with women groups to identify gender-related issues; the poorest and vulnerable such as female-\nheaded households to assess their special needs; and households in geographically remote areas where rural \npoverty is most acute. The assessment will ensure the participation of various stakeholders through methods such as \nparticipatory stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions, and rapid appraisal. The assessment will identify \nmonitoring and evaluation indicators.  \n \nThe proposed project intends to address rural poverty through sustainable RF, therefore, the important focus of the \nsocial assessment will be the need for social intermediation as an investment in demand-side development for \noutreach expansion.
