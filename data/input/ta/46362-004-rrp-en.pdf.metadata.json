THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMetropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), to be guaranteed by the Republic of \nthe Philippines, for the additional financing of the Angat Water Transmission Improvement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The original loan for the ongoing project, approved by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nin 2016, supports MWSS in improving its water transmission system, by constructing a new \nupstream tunnel from the Ipo Dam to the Bigte Basins, and reinforcing water security. The \nproposed  additional  financing  will  allow  MWSS  to  expand  the  rehabilitation  of  the  water \ntransmission system, reduce water losses and increase the viability of the ongoing project by \nconstructing a new aqueduct from the Bigte Basins to the Novaliches Portal to convey water to \nthe downstream treatment plants that supply water to Metro Manila. The proposed additional \nfinancing will (i) increase the capacity of the Angat transmission system to meet increasing \ndemands and (ii) mitigate the risk of a total loss of water supply to Metro Manila by building \nresilience.2 While this project had been planned since 2018 well before the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic, it will have significant benefits by improving overall health and hygiene of \nthe population (para.5).   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Overview. While water resources are plentiful in the Philippines, they are unevenly \ndistributed across the country due to rainfall variability and other geographic features of each \nregion. The changing climatic conditions are exacerbating the situation. Growing population and \nmigration to urban areas are further increasing the demand for clean water beyond the available \nsupply. In many areas, groundwater resources have been over abstracted and are contaminated \ndue to improper human waste management. Nationwide, urban population with access to safe \nwater supply was 99% in 2017, but only 47% through a piped water supply system.3 Outside of \nMetro Manila, water infrastructure condition is generally poor with water losses typically at 25%\u2013\n50%, and service provision is inadequate requiring significant investment across the country. \n \n4.  Metro Manila city profile. Metro Manila comprises 17 cities and municipalities. It spans \nan area of 620 square kilometers and has 12.9 million inhabitants, about 12% of the country\u2019s \ntotal population.4 Metro Manila\u2019s population is increasing by 6.1% annually, a much faster pace \nthan the national annual growth rate of 1.5%.5 As the commercial, financial and industrial center \nof the Philippines, Metro Manila accounts for 37% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. \nSustainable delivery of basic urban services has a direct impact on Metro Manila\u2019s economy and \nis critical for the region\u2019s development.  \n \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016.

Manila \n(Loan 3377-PHI). https://www.adb.org/projects/46362-002/main. \n2  ADB provided technical assistance to help prepare the additional financing (ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the \nRepublic of the Philippines for the Metro Manila Water and Sanitation Development. Manila [TA 8769-PHI]). \n3 Joint Monitoring Program. 2017. Progress on household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene 2000-2017. New York.  \n4  Philippine Statistics Authority. 2015 Census of Population. http://www.psa.gov.ph/content/highlights-philippine-\npopulation-2015-census-population (accessed on 15 September 2019). \n5  United Nations Secretariat. 2017 Revision of World Population Prospects. https://population.un.org/wpp/ (accessed \non 15 September 2019). \n ", "2 \n5.  Institutional arrangements for water supply. MWSS, a government-owned corporation, \nis mandated to provide potable water and sanitation services to Metro Manila and the adjacent \nprovinces of Rizal and Cavite. In 1997, MWSS awarded two concession contracts to two separate \nprivate corporations for water treatment and distribution and wastewater management,6 while \nretaining the responsibility for raw water supply. The private corporations significantly improved \nwater supply services\u2014the serviced population doubled since 1997 and more than 90% of the \nregion\u2019s inhabitants have 24-hour access to potable water. Nonrevenue water decreased from \n45%\u201370% in 1997 to 12%\u201329% in 2018. \n \n6.  Water  scarcity  and  impacts  on  personal  hygiene  during  the  pandemic.  The \nseriousness of water insecurity in the city became apparent when a prolonged dry season led to \na water supply crisis in 2019 (from March to May). During rationing, the worst hit neighborhoods \nhad no water for several days and only a few hours of water for weeks. MWSS had assured raw \nwater supply to the concessionaires and planned a series of projects to ensure bulk water was \nprovided to meet the rapidly growing water demand in Metro Manila. Given the strong water-\nsanitation-hygiene linkage, any water shortage or deterioration in water quality will adversely \nimpact the personal hygiene of Metro Manila\u2019s communities, which could hamper efforts to battle \nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, MWSS\u2019s plan to enhance water security and \nwater quality to Metro Manila is a practical response aligned with measures to arrest devastating \nhealth, social, and economic impacts of diseases including the current COVID-19 pandemic.   \n \n7.  Sources of water. The Umiray\u2013Angat\u2013Ipo system (or the Angat water transmission \nsystem) serves as the source of more than 90% of Metro Manila\u2019s water requirement. Water from \nthe Angat Dam is discharged and stored at the Ipo Dam about 5 kilometers (km) downstream of \nthe Angat Dam. Water from the Ipo Dam is then transmitted to the Bigte Basins through three \nparallel tunnels (the Angat upstream system) and on to the Novaliches Portal through six parallel \naqueducts (the Angat downstream system),7 from where the two concessionaries treat and supply \nwater to Metro Manila.8 \n \n8.  The Angat upstream system and the scope of the ongoing project. The ongoing \nproject comprises the construction of the urgently needed Tunnel no. 4 (T4) to supplement water \ntransmission  from  the  Ipo  Dam  to  the  Bigte  Basins.  This  will  enable  the  rehabilitation  or \ndecommissioning of the other tunnels (T1, T2, and T3). T4 will increase the Angat upstream \nsystem\u2019s design capacity from 52.7 cubic meters per second (m3/sec) to 71.7 m3/sec. The civil \nworks contract for T4 (the only works contract of the ongoing project) comprising construction of \na 4-meter (m) finished internal diameter and 6.3 km long tunnel is substantially complete and is \nexpected to be commissioned in June 2020, 3 months prior to its scheduled completion date. \n \n9.  Change in the original loan amount. In October 2019, ADB agreed to MWSS\u2019s request \nto cancel $55.97 million of the original loan amount of $123.30 million, for a revised loan amount \nof $67.33 million. MWSS\u2019s request for partial cancellation of the original loan amount was made \nin view of the substantial completion of the T4 civil works under the ongoing project and  to reduce \nthe financing charges that MWSS would accrue on the undisbursed loan savings, considering \nthat all identified works were substantially complete. The cancelled portion of the original loan \n \n6  Maynilad Water Services, Inc. (Maynilad) serves Metro Manila\u2019s West Zone, and Manila Water Company, Inc. (Manila \nWater) serves Metro Manila\u2019s East Zone.  \n7  Aqueducts (AQs) 1\u20136 were constructed between 1939 and 2012. AQ1 (built in 1939) and AQ2 (built in 1945) are the \noldest, and AQ6 (built in 2012) is the latest. AQ1 and AQ2 can be deemed as one aqueduct because AQ2 branches \nserve only as parallel reinforcements of some segments of AQ1. \n8  A Schematic Diagram of the Angat Water Transmission System (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n ", "3 \ncomprised savings from (i) unused allocations to civil works and consulting contracts ($30.37 \nmillion), (ii) unused contingency allocation ($22.00 million), and (iii) partial allocation to the \nfinancing charges during construction ($3.60 million).9  \n \n10.  Ongoing project\u2019s performance. The ongoing project is performing well; and all loan \ncovenants, including the fiduciary and safeguard requirements, have been complied with.10 It is \nrated on track as per the project performance rating.11 As of 30 April 2020, physical progress \nstood at 99% for an elapsed loan period of 66%. The cumulative disbursement was $59.6 million, \nor 88.5% of the revised loan amount.  \n \n11.  The Angat downstream system and water delivery. To ensure water from the Angat \nupstream system delivers continuous water to Metro Manila, the Angat downstream system must \nbe in good condition. However, several aqueducts in the Angat downstream system are in a poor \nstate. Of the existing six aqueducts, (i) structural assessments of AQ1 and AQ2 suggest they \nhave deteriorated significantly and fittings are unserviceable resulting in water loss, and (ii) \nseismic assessments suggest that AQ3, AQ4, and the downstream part of AQ5 are weak and not \nearthquake resilient. Under the current condition, the Angat downstream system is expected to \nrequire operational interruptions or a total stoppage when leaks are being rectified. Rectification \nis expected every 5 years, and the supply-disrupting repairs are estimated to take about 60 days. \n \n12.  Construction of a new aqueduct and service continuity. The construction of a new \naqueduct\u2014aqueduct no. 7 (AQ7)\u2014 will add flexibility to the Angat downstream system and enable \nMWSS to rehabilitate the existing aqueducts without disrupting water supply. After the completion \nof AQ7, MWSS will decommission AQ1 and AQ2, and rehabilitate the following aqueducts during \nthe specified periods: AQ4 (2025\u20132027), AQ3 (2028\u20132030), and part of AQ5 (2031\u20132032). Once \nthe rehabilitation is complete, the risk of a system breakdown every 5 years will have been \neliminated. The new aqueduct is a water security measure for Metro Manila and will match \ncapacities of the Angat downstream and upstream systems to meet future water demands.12 \n \n13.  Proposed change in scope and additional financing. To ensure service continuity, \nMWSS requested an expansion of the scope of the ongoing project to finance AQ7. The proposed \nadditional financing for AQ7 will cover construction costs, construction supervision, and capacity \n \n9  At the appraisal stage, the T4 works were estimated at $88.1 million (excluding taxes) while the actual contract \nawarded was for $60.1 million. The significantly lower contract amount was the result of a change in the tunneling \nmethod. The bidding document and cost estimates had been prepared based on the drill-and-blast method; however, \nthe bidder proposed the use of a tunnel-boring machine, which proved to be cheaper and faster. The higher initial \nestimates were also based on the following considerations: (i) the absence of recent similar works in the country to \nserve  as  comparators;  (ii)  the  remote  project  site,  anticipated  to  result  in  higher  mobilization  costs;  and \n(iii) unmanaged political risks that may have caused implementation delays and cost escalation. Further, the \nconsulting services contract is about $2.4 million lower than the estimate because late consultant mobilization \nreduced the amount of required consulting inputs. The consultant team was mobilized in 2018, about 2 years later \nthan scheduled. Since construction had started in 2016, MWSS had recruited consultants financed from its own \nresources to supervise the works. The contingency allocation was cancelled because the construction progress had \nreached 93% (when the cancellation was approved in October 2019); technically critical works had been completed; \nand no significant cost increases were anticipated until the targeted completion date in June 2020. \n10 The review of the project performance is in accordance with the criteria specified in Table 1 of ADB. 2018. Staff \nInstruction on Business Process for Additional Financing (Sovereign Operations). Manila. \n11 More details on the performance of the ongoing project are provided in the Summary of Project Performance \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n12 MWSS\u2019s current water right is 46 m3/sec. In 2020, MWSS will be entitled to obtain 54.6 m3/sec (subject to the approval \nby the National Water Resources Board). If the new water right is fully used, and with the additional supply of \n5.8 m3/sec from the Laguna de Bay system, the Angat water transmission system will be able to meet Metro Manila\u2019s \nwater demand until 2025, which is estimated at 59.8 m3/sec. Starting in 2023, the Kaliwa Dam system is expected to \nprovide additional water to meet Metro Manila\u2019s demand until 2031. \n ", "4 \ndevelopment. The proposal meets the eligibility criteria for additional financing13 because the \noverall  project (i) remains technically feasible, economically viable, and financially sound; (ii) is \nconsidered a high priority by the government; (iii) is consistent with the ongoing project\u2019s development \nobjectives;  and  (iv)  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132023  for  the \nPhilippines.14 \n \n14.  Additional financing is the suitable modality also because (i) T4 and AQ7 are integral parts \nof a unified system, and (ii) AQ7 will help the ongoing project achieve its outcome by strengthening \nthe  downstream  water  transmission  capacity,  which  will  ensure  that  the  overall  Angat \ntransmission system keeps delivering adequate and reliable amounts of water to Metro Manila. \nUltimately, this will further improve water supply services and meet growing demand. \n \n15.  The overall project will enhance Metro Manila\u2019s water security and the benefits will be \nachieved for all residents. This was a fundamental requirement before the emergence of COVID-\n19. Now, the overall project has an elevated importance and urgency as an essential part of the \nresponse to the COVID-19 pandemic (and other future health emergencies). \n \n16.  Strategic  alignment.  The  proposed  additional  financing  will  further  strengthen  the \nongoing project\u2019s contribution to the achievement of the government target of 100% water supply \ncoverage by 2025, as indicated in the Philippine Water Supply Sector Roadmap.15 The country \npartnership strategy lists water and other urban infrastructure and services (WUS) as one of five \npriority sectors for extended support in the Philippines. The overall project is also in line with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 and its operational priorities 3 (building disaster-resilient infrastructure investments) \nand 4 (making cities more livable);16 and with the Water Operational Plan (2011\u20132020), which \ndiscusses ways for ADB to help fill the gap between water demand and supply.17 \n \n17.  Development coordination. Key development partners in the Philippines\u2019 WUS sector \nare ADB, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the World Bank. ADB has reengaged \nwith the government on WUS in 2016, supporting water supply improvements in Metro Manila \nand provincial cities. After the new government was formed in 2016, Sulong Pilipinas replaced \nthe Philippine Development Forum, which used to organize regular meetings with development \npartners.  An  annual  consultative  conference  is  organized  under  Sulong  Pilipinas,  bringing \ntogether business communities, development partners, and respective government agencies to \nexchange information and coordinate activities.18 \n \n18.  Lessons learned. Major implementation issues of the ongoing project resulted from (i) \ndelays in recruiting the construction supervision consultant and (ii) the retirement of a substantial \nnumber of experienced MWSS staff. To address these issues, the proposed additional financing \nwill (i) assist MWSS in meeting its consulting needs by using the consultant engaged under the \nSoutheast Asia Urban Services Facility;19 (ii) strengthen project implementation support for \nprocurement, disbursement, and environmental and social safeguard compliance; and (iii) train \nMWSS staff in operation and maintenance (O&M) and financial management. \n \n13 ADB. 2018.

Seismic and structural assessments supported by ADB informed \nthe preliminary designs as well as the technical specifications in the bidding document for T4. The \nadditional financing activities will follow a similar approach to the AQ7 technical assessments and \nin overseeing the bidding and management of the complex design\u2013build contract. The proposed \nadditional financing will help limit the adverse impact of natural hazards and environmental \ndegradation  and  ensure  the  sustainability  of  the  project  through  capacity  building.  The \nconstruction of T4 and AQ7 will support implementation of the water security road map for Metro \nManila and address the growing water demand in the region.  \n \n20.  ADB is a trusted partner for the Philippines in its efforts to engage with communities during \nimplementation of public works projects. A well-prepared program of community engagement, \nwith prominent partnership with groups led by women, will deliver support on the need for robust \nwater, sanitation, and hygiene (or WASH), with a focus on \u2018poor\u2019 areas bearing a high burden of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The project is aligned with the following impact: universal access to safe, adequate, and \nsustainable water supply by 2025. It will have the following outcome: adequate and reliable \namounts of water supplied in Metro Manila.20 The aggregate impact and outcome of the overall \nproject are unchanged, but new outcome indicators were added to reflect the performance \nmeasurement of a new output. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n22.  Output 1: New tunnel constructed. Output 1 is unchanged. \n \n23.  Output 2: Capacity-building support provided. Output 2, while unchanged in essence, \nwill include new activities under the proposed additional financing to (i) strengthen gender and \ndevelopment programs being implemented under the ongoing project; (ii) train MWSS staff on \nO&M  of  the  tunnels  and  aqueducts;  and  (iii)  expand  the  awareness  programs  on  water \nconservation, hygiene promotion, and health-related risks. \n \n24.  Output 3: New aqueduct constructed. Output 3, a new output, includes the construction \nof a new aqueduct (AQ7), which will have a finished internal diameter of 3.6 m and a total length \nof about 15 km. Works will also include (i) three segments of tunneling works for a combined \nlength of about 3.5 km, (ii) aqueduct crossings, (iii) a new receiving basin at the Novaliches \nJunction, (iv) two interconnections at the Bigte Basins and one interconnection at the Novaliches \nPortal, and (v) two blank flange ends for future connections to Bulacan areas. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n25.  MWSS requested a regular loan of $126.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nfor  the  proposed  additional  financing.  The  loan,  to  be  guaranteed  by  the  Republic  of  the \nPhilippines, will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 6.5 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft loan and guarantee agreements. Based on the straight-line repayment method, the \n \n20 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "6 \naverage maturity is 16 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% per year.

Project readiness. Technical bids for the sole civil works package have been evaluated \nand  the  financial  bids  of  qualified  bidders  will  be  opened  once  the  enhanced  community \nquarantine is lifted. Contract award is expected at the time of loan effectiveness.  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  Aqueduct alignment. All six existing aqueducts are contained within the 60 m wide right \nof way (ROW) of MWSS, and AQ7 will also be laid within this ROW. Trial routes revealed that the \nspaces between the aqueducts are very narrow, which carries a risk that the AQ7 construction \nworks might damage adjacent aqueducts. Therefore, the most logical solution for AQ7 is to follow \nthe current alignment of AQ1 and AQ2 (which will be decommissioned and removed because of \ntheir age and poor condition) from the Bigte Basins to the Novaliches Portal. This will significantly \nreduce the risk of damaging other aqueducts during the construction of AQ7. \n \n30.  Consideration of technical options. Detailed hydraulic analysis was carried out for AQ7 \nusing various scenarios experienced by the existing aqueducts, such as failure, repair, and \nrehabilitation. With AQ7 following the current alignment of AQ1 and AQ2, six technical options \nwere considered for managing the water flow from T4, including different pipe configurations and \nconstruction of a common basin at the Bigte Basins compound. The evaluation criteria included \n(i) system flexibility, (ii) flow capacities, (iii) ease of construction, (iv) least disruption to services, \n(v) capital and operational costs, and (vi) operational flexibility at the basins. Based on these \ncriteria, the selected option will have T4 supply AQ7 through a T4 transition basin, and AQ5 and \nAQ6 through a T4 interconnection basin. \n \n31.  Optimum aqueduct size. The optimum size for AQ7 is a diameter of 3.6 m, calculated to \ncarry an ultimate capacity of 17.4 m3/sec to match the tunnel capacity (after the completion of T4 \n ", "8 \nunder the ongoing project). Further, the following two extreme failure scenarios were analyzed: \n(i) a powerful earthquake destroying AQ3 and AQ4, the weakest among the existing aqueducts \n(once AQ1 and AQ2 are removed); and (ii) a powerful earthquake destroying all of the Angat \nwater transmission system except T4 and AQ7. The analysis indicates that a smaller aqueduct \nsize (3.3 m) will not be able to deliver the potential flow from T4, while a larger size (4.0 m) will be \nimpractical since its excess capacity would not be used. \n \n32.  Safe working under the COVID-19 conditions. The impact of the disease is evolving, \nand project implementation will be responsive and flexible in meeting emerging needs and new \nguidance. The project will strictly follow government guidance on safe working in COVID-19 \nconditions, adhering to the most robust medical and scientific advice. The project parties will be \nrequired to assimilate emerging international construction best practice on distancing (where \npractical for works of this nature), implementation methodologies, effective use of forced air \nventilation systems and personal protective equipment. This is vital for works in deep trench and \nother confined spaces, where person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 disease is a high risk. \n \n33.  Operation and maintenance. Because the Angat water transmission system will be \noperated using gravity, no pumping or power is required. Being a raw water bulk transmission \nsystem, it will not involve any chemicals. Treatment will be undertaken downstream of the system \nby the concessionaires. As AQ7 will replace the existing AQ1 and AQ2, no additional staff will be \nneeded to operate the system. In accordance with the concessionaire agreements, MWSS will \nown the assets, but the two concessionaires (Maynilad and Manila Water) will be responsible for \nO&M. Lessons learned from the project under COVID-19 conditions will be collated in an O&M \nmanual to document best practices and synthesize approaches for future health emergencies.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n34.  Economic analysis. The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.23 The calculation of project benefits \nconsidered the non-incremental benefit from savings in the cost of purchasing alternative water \nsupply. The \u201cfailure rate\u201d approach was used to assess the benefit.24 The economic net present \nvalue of the project is $48.0 million, and the economic internal rate of return is estimated at 14.8%, \nhigher than the threshold rate of 9.0%. According to the sensitivity analysis, the project remains \neconomically viable with an economic internal rate of return of 9.0% even under the worst-case \nscenario of three downside risks occurring at the same time: (i) 20% increase in construction \ncosts, (ii) 20% increase in O&M costs, and (iii) 20% decrease in benefits. \n \n35.  Financial analysis. Since MWSS is not expected to generate income from the completion \nof AQ7, the financial assessment considered the financial sustainability based on proper system \nO&M. The two concessionaires will cover the incremental O&M cost. MWSS also has sufficient \ncash reserves to manage the O&M cost if the concessionaires fail to cover it. The financial \nsustainability of the project is satisfactory because MWSS is assured of recovering the full cost of \ndebt service and the O&M cost, under the terms of the concession agreements with Maynilad and \nManila Water.25 \n \n \n23 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n24 The failure rate assessment was based on experts\u2019 opinion, estimating a system failure once every 5 years, which \nwould reduce the water flow by one-third of the system\u2019s full capacity and require 60 days to restore full capacity. \nEconomic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nC.  Governance \n \n36.  Financial management assessments. MWSS\u2019s financial management risk is moderate. \nAlthough the agency has demonstrated adequate capacity to manage projects financed by \ndevelopment partners such as ADB, Export-Import Bank of China, the Japan International \nCooperation Agency, and the World Bank, the potential risk is that regular staff currently involved \nin ongoing projects will avail of MWSS\u2019s early retirement program. The measures to mitigate this \nrisk involve (i) training, including on-the-job-training, for new MWSS staff on ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures and international best practices; and (ii) improvements to project budgeting and \naccounting systems, including the computerization of the accounting system. \n \n37.  Procurement capacity assessments. MWSS\u2019s procurement risk is rated moderate. Its \nBids and Awards Committee is responsible for all its procurement activities, and its staff receive \nregular training on the government\u2019s procurement policies, regulations, and guidelines. However, \nit has limited experience in managing large procurement packages through international open \ncompetitive bidding, particularly those with design\u2013build contract forms. To mitigate procurement \nrisks, (i) the number of contracts was reduced to a minimum and (ii) ample training and support \non ADB\u2019s procurement policies and regulations will be provided. The procurement of works and \nthe recruitment of consulting services will be conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers \n(2017, as amended from time to time). \n \n38.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto  and  discussed  with  the  government  and  MWSS.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. An integrity due diligence was undertaken. \nNo significant integrity risks were identified. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n39.  The project is classified as a general intervention since it will indirectly target poverty \nreduction among water end-users in Metro Manila and the communities residing near the project \nsites. A socioeconomic survey, carried out as part of project preparation, indicates that more than \n30% of residents of the communities residing near the project sites are poor and that some \nhouseholds are unable to connect to the water supply system because of the high connection \nfees. The survey also revealed gender inequality because traditional gender roles still prevail. \n \n40.  The two concessionaires, Maynilad and Manila Water, have programs to ensure that their \nservices are accessible to the poor communities of Metro Manila.26 The project\u2019s poverty and \nsocially inclusive design features include (i) prioritizing communities residing near the project sites \nfor construction-related employment especially for unskilled labor; (ii) referring poor households \nto the livelihood and skills programs in the project area; (iii) implementing proper traffic route \nplanning and management to mitigate road safety risks during construction; and (iv) implementing \ninformation, education, and communication campaigns to promote awareness of social and health \nrisks. These approaches will be strategically aligned with Metro Manila\u2019s emerging responses to \nthe COVID-19 pandemic and will help to ease the burden on heavily stressed healthcare systems. \n \n41.  The communities affected by the project\u2019s construction work will receive support in building \ngreater grassroots awareness and practical understanding of the principles of WASH, and how \nthis can help in curtailing the spread of COVID-19 and other diseases. The community outreach \n \n26 Maynilad\u2019s Samahang Tubig Maynilad and Manila Water\u2019s Tubig Para Sa Barangay. \n ", "10 \nprogram will recognize that WASH is a key element of public health and a central part of the \nUnited  Nation\u2019s  Sustainable  Development  Goal  6.  Targeted  outreach  to  people  deemed \nvulnerable to COVID-19, including the aged and those with medical conditions will be supported \nby  the  full  engagement  of  local  government  units,  barangays,  community  groups,  and \nnongovernmental organizations. It will draw on guidance from the Departments of Health, Public \nWorks and Housing, and Education, and best international practice, including from neighboring \ncountries. \n \n42.  Gender. The project is classified as some gender elements. It will strengthen the gender \nand social development programs being implemented under the ongoing project. Proactive \ngender features of the project design include (i) integrating the needs of women, children, and the \nelderly in traffic route management and road safety programs; and (ii) providing public awareness \nand training to communities residing near the project sites on social and health risks (gender-\nbased violence, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, COVID-19, gambling, and drug and \nalcohol abuse).  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the safeguard categories \nof the project are as follows: \n \n44.  Environment (category B). The project is not expected to cause irreversible adverse \nenvironmental impacts. An initial environmental examination report was prepared in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Most environmental impacts are expected during \nconstruction and arise from the removal of trees and other vegetation types, modification of \nterrain, potential siltation of nearby waterways, noise and dust, increased site traffic, and greater \nrisks to occupational and public health and safety. These impacts will be limited within the \ndesignated 25 m wide construction area and within MWSS\u2019s existing ROW.27  \n \n45.  Involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category C). No land \nacquisition is needed, but 11 informal structures inside the designated 25 m wide construction \narea and MWSS\u2019s existing ROW will be permanently affected (demolished prior to construction). \nSix households will be affected, five of which will have to relocate. Losses of residential and \ncommercial structures and crops will be compensated at replacement costs.28 No indigenous \npeoples and ancestral domain areas will be affected by the proposed additional financing. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n46.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.29 \n \n \n27 Public consultations were carried out during the preparation of the initial environmental examination report consistent \nwith the requirements of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The grievance redress mechanism set up under \nthe ongoing project will continue to help address any grievance from project-related environmental impacts. Initial \nEnvironmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Measures to mitigate the \nimpacts are included in the environmental management plan, which have been incorporated in the bidding \ndocuments for civil works. \n28 A resettlement plan was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the Philippines \nnational law and posted on the ADB website.
