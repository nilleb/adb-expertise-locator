Results-Based  Project  Management  for  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries \n(approved in December 2007 and completed in December 2012).1 The technical assistance \n(TA) focused on building the institutional capacity in selected entities in Papua New Guinea \n(National Airports Corporation and Department of Works), Samoa (Electric Power Corporation \nand Land Transport Authority), Timor-Leste (Department of Water Supply and Sanitation), and \nTonga (Ministry of Finance and National Planning). The TA recognized that (i) building capacity \nin management for development results must go at the pace of the organization requiring longer \nTA and flexibility in scheduling, and (ii) planning the implementation support requires long-term \ncommitment to facilitate sustainable change. \n \n2.  Enhancing  Engagement  with  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries,  Phase  2 \n(approved in May 2012 and completed in October 2020).2 The TA is phase 2 of the earlier TA \n6475-REG (approved in August 2008 and completed in March 2013). Both the TA focused on \nenhancing development partner coordination and harmonization, and generating greater country \nparticipation in, and ownership of, the development process in line with the intent of the Paris \nDeclaration for improving aid effectiveness. The development coordination offices (DCOs) were \nestablished in 11 Pacific island countries (PIC-11). The midterm review of TA 8088 has identified \nthat a sustained presence by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in PIC-11 is in line with the \nongoing scaling up of ADB\u2019s operations in Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) and fits \nwell with the Framework for Strategy 2030. Upgraded DCOs will provide stronger logistical \nsupport  to  ADB  missions,  promote  local  capacity  building,  and  facilitate  day-to-day \ncommunications.  \n \n3.  Towards Effective and Sustainable Delivery of Development Results in Fragile \nSituations in the Pacific (approved in November 2018 and ongoing).3 The TA focuses on \n(i) fragility assessments and project reviews in fragile situations, and (ii) capacity building and \ninstitutional strengthening on fragility-sensitive approaches to development to achieve effective \nand sustainable delivery of development results in fragile situations in the Pacific.  \n \n4.  Building Project Implementation Capacities in the Pacific (approved in March 2016 \nand ongoing). 4 The TA focused on improving readiness of future loan and grant projects in the \nPacific. The TA also complemented the Pacific Department\u2019s Project Improvement Action Plan \nby providing advisory and capacity building support to counterpart agencies responsible for \nproject implementation activities in the Pacific. The TA was well received by executing and \nimplementing agencies who appreciated its support in terms of implementation support. In few \ninstances, the TA is forced to substitute the consulting support of transaction TA projects, loans, \nand grants due to shortage of financial resources on those projects. Capacity reinforcements for \nadditional  due  diligence,  handholding  of  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in  project \nmanagement, procurement, financial management, safeguards, and contract management is \n \n1  ADB.

Implementing  the  Pacific  Regional  Audit  Initiative  in  Pacific  Island  Countries, \nPhase 2 (2013\u20132019).5 The TA provided capacity building support to Supreme Audit Institutions \n(SAI) in Pacific DMCs. Some SAIs were supported in the review of audit legislations and in \nundertaking  cooperative  audits  on  key  issues  such  as  climate  change  and  public  debt \nmanagement. A very successful initiative was the subregional audit support program undertaken \nunder the TA which allows for group hands-on training of auditors led by an expert to complete \nthe audit of key accounts in the DMC.  \n \n6.

The TA highlighted the need for \ncontinuous training to upskill staff in executing and implementing agencies of ADB projects. \n \n \n5  ADB.
