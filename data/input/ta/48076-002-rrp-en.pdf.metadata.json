THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nMongolia for the Ensuring Inclusiveness and Service Delivery for Persons with Disabilities Project. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan \nFund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) for the Ensuring Inclusiveness and Service Delivery for \nPersons with Disabilities Project, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration of the grant.1 \n \n2.  Often, public support to persons with disabilities (PWDs) focus on providing assistance \nunder the concept of social welfare. However, this project will highlight what PWDs can do to \nensure inclusion of PWDs in society, including them in mainstream economic activities, creating \nopportunities in education and employment, and providing access to the services they need. It \nwill strengthen and institutionalize early identification of disability; improve service delivery and \naccess to the physical environment; improve employment prospects; and contribute to strategic \ndevelopment for PWDs, including social welfare reform, awareness raising, and attitude change.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The prevalence of disability in Mongolia of about 4% is based on the 2010 census and is \nlikely to be underestimated.3 Disability assessment is currently based on an outdated, narrow \nmedical approach to determine work ability loss. Early diagnosis and identification of disability in \nchildren is underdeveloped, while older people are not recognized as disabled even if they require \nlong-term care. PWDs in Mongolia and their households represent a population subgroup with \nsubstantially higher incidence of poverty and lower human development indicators than the rest \nof the population.4 For instance, 42% of households with PWDs live in poverty compared with \n18% of households without PWDs, 28% of PWDs aged 15\u201359 years are in the labor force \ncompared with 69% of those without disabilities, and 43% of children with disabilities (CWDs) \naged 6\u201318 years are unable to read compared with only 4% for people without disabilities. PWDs \nand the families of CWDs spend more on health services than nondisabled people, including for \nmedicine, diagnostic procedures, and travel costs associated with visiting the capital for tests that \nare not available in aimag (province) health centers. This increased expenditure contributes to \ngreater levels of poverty among PWD households. Parents consider the quality of education \nservices for CWDs as low, and disabled people\u2019s organizations (DPOs) report poor access for \nPWDs  to  tertiary  education.  The  project\u2019s  target  aimags  (Arkhangai,  Darkhan-uul,  Dornod, \nDundgovi, Khovd, and Khuvsgul) have a large proportion of PWDs and a high poverty ratio among \nPWDs. Based on proxy means test data, the percentage of PWDs in the bottom three deciles of \npoverty is 55% in the selected aimags and 44% in the other 15 aimags. \n \n4.  PWDs, especially those with intellectual disabilities, typically lack access to education, \nhealth care, social protection, and employment, and are marginalized in society. Early diagnostic \nand intervention services for most CWDs are either unavailable or of poor quality. Poor access to \neducation at all levels means that PWDs are poorly prepared for employment compared with other \npeople. Lack of enforcement of the existing universal design standards and limited investment \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Ensuring \nInclusiveness and Service Delivery for Persons with Disabilities (TA 8850-MON). \n3  In 2010, the population of Mongolia was 2,754,685. \n4  Poverty and social analysis prepared under the TA (footnote 2). \n ", "2 \nresult in poor physical access to public buildings, including government offices, hospitals, and \nschools, and to transportation facilities. These are all major impediments and often prevent PWDs \nfrom accessing basic municipal and social services or nearby workplaces. PWDs face huge \nbarriers in entering job markets because they lack skills, and companies are not prepared to \nprovide jobs for the disabled.5 Access to orthopedic equipment and assistive devices is very \nlimited, especially to new technologies and devices based on information and communication \ntechnology, reducing the potential for PWDs to compensate for their disabilities and succeed at \nschool or in the workplace. Most people generally do not recognize PWDs as individuals capable \nof living independently and contributing positively to society. This is a major source of frustration \nfor PWDs, leading to feelings of vulnerability and rejection. The successive barriers encountered \nby PWDs during their lifetime underline the need for early childhood support that is sustained in \nschool and throughout their professional life to ensure successful inclusion in society. \n \n5.  The Government of Mongolia demonstrates strong commitment to international rights \nframeworks  and  development  goals  on  disability.6 This  is  especially  reflected  in  its  active \nengagement with the DPO community and the adoption of the new Law on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities in February 2016, which moves the sector paradigm from a health and social \nwelfare model based on a medical understanding of disability to a rights-based model built on a \nbiopsychosocial understanding of disability underpinned by the International Classification of \nFunctioning, Disability, and Health (ICF).7 The new law represents an opportunity to address the \npoor human development indicators for PWDs. The priority areas for improvement identified by \nDPOs, the government, and experts are (i) early identification of disability, including prenatal and \npostnatal  screening  services,  to  ensure  early  intervention  to  minimize  the  impact  on  child \ndevelopment and subsequent education outcomes; (ii) maximum functioning and active economic \nparticipation with support from social services, habilitation, and rehabilitation;8 (iii) inclusive \neducation and employment services; (iv) improved enforcement of legislation on accessibility to \nthe physical environment, transport, and information, and increased availability of assistive \ndevices and technology; and (v) strategic measures such as changing attitudes and mindsets \ntoward PWDs, making the social welfare system more equitable and targeted, using the ICF to \nassess disability and planning services, and defining disability in monitoring and data frameworks. \n \n6.  DPOs in Ulaanbaatar seem to underrepresent PWDs in rural areas and those with \nintellectual disabilities. The organizations provide some services in Ulaanbaatar and in some \naimags, but compared with DPOs in other countries, they have a limited role in employment \npromotion.  DPOs  mainly  support  segregated  forms  of  employment,  such  as  sheltered \nemployment and self-employment, largely because (i) DPOs and public employment agency staff \nlack knowledge and skills to effectively support individual pathways to mainstream employment \nfor PWDs, and (ii) the regulatory framework for involving DPOs in providing employment and \nsocial services is not well developed. \n                                                \n5  Private and public companies do not have policies on and knowledge of providing employment for the PWDs. \n6  International rights frameworks and development goals on disability include the Convention on the Rights of Persons \nwith Disabilities (United Nations. 2006. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. New York.), ratified by \nMongolia in 2008; the Incheon Strategy to \u201cMake the Right Real\u201d for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific \n(United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. 2012. Incheon Strategy to \u201cMake the \nRight Real\u201d for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific. Bangkok); and the Sustainable Development Goals \nset out in the Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030 (State Great Khural. 2016. Mongolia Sustainable \nDevelopment Vision 2030. Ulaanbaatar). \n7  The ICF is a way of understanding disability as a social construct rather than a medical problem. Introducing the ICF \nwill enable Mongolia to develop policies and programs for removing barriers to PWDs participating in society. \n8  Habilitation focuses on learning new skills, whereas rehabilitation focuses on regaining lost skills. \n ", "3 \n7.  Strategic fit. The project strongly aligns with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Social \nProtection Strategy and Social Protection Operational Plan, 2014\u20132020.9 It will support renewed \nemphasis on social protection in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 to protect the most \nvulnerable members of society.10 In supporting PWDs through social protection and stronger \nsocial safety nets to ensure decent living standards, the project is in line with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020.11 The project also supports the implementation of \nthe Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030 (footnote 6). ADB is coordinating project \ninputs with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which is implementing two \ntechnical assistance projects on disability in Mongolia, and a memorandum of understanding will \nbe signed before project implementation to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication.12 \n \n8.  Disability puts women at a disadvantage, and factors such as age and poverty widen the \ngender gap. The poverty rate for women is typically higher than that for men, and poverty and \ndisability are associated. The disability rate for women, particularly those with severe disability, is \nhigher than for men at any age. Even so, analysis conducted during project preparation has shown \nthat disability among girls and women appears to be underreported, with men being 28% more \nlikely to be reported as disabled than women. Further, while 30% of men with disabilities aged \n15\u201359 years work, this percentage is only 25% for women. Moreover, 80% of people caring for \nPWDs are women, who often do not receive adequate social protection and support services. \n \n9.  Lessons learned. ADB has a successful record in social protection and welfare in \nMongolia, but it has limited experience in disability, which is an issue that cuts across ADB sectors \n(health and education) and areas such as infrastructure development, social protection, social \nservices and care, and employment. The project represents a learning opportunity for ADB in an \narea  of  increasing  international  importance,  especially  in  relation  to  (i)  the  United  Nations \nConvention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and (ii) an aging population that results in \nincreased numbers of PWDs (footnote 6). Specific ADB support for PWDs in Mongolia includes \na JFPR grant for Expanding Employment Opportunities for Poor Disabled Persons implemented \nin  2002\u20132006,  and  the  Social  Security  Sector  Development  Program,  which  assisted  in \ndeveloping manufacturing capacity for prosthetics and establishing community care centers.13 \nADB\u2019s work in health and education in Mongolia, although extensive, has not focused on disability. \nIn 2005, ADB published the Disabled People and Development working paper as an attempt to \nintegrate disability into poverty reduction and development strategies and other sectors.14 This \nhas not led to operations directed at disability. \n \n10.  The  Italian  Raoul  Follereau  Association,  an  international  network  of  grassroots \norganizations  more  commonly known  as  AIFO,  has  been focusing on  the  development  of \ncommunity-based rehabilitation. The People\u2019s Republic of China is providing funding for the \nconstruction  of  the  National  Children\u2019s  Rehabilitation  Center  in  the  Bayangol  district  of \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2001.

Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be that equal participation for PWDs in society achieved. The outcome will \nbe that access to services and employment for PWDs increased. The geographic focus of the \nproject will be on Ulaanbaatar and six aimags. The project will create new services in aimag \ncenters and provide outreach services to CWDs and PWDs in soums (aimag subdistricts) and \nkhoroos (Ulaanbaatar subdistricts). Some project activities focusing on strategic issues will have \nnational reach. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The project will support the Government of Mongolia in addressing a major social and \nrights issue by ensuring inclusiveness and delivery of services for PWDs in Ulaanbaatar and in \nthe aimags. The overall aim of the project is to ensure access to employment for PWDs to \nincrease their autonomy and contribution to the economy and society in general. The project will \nsupport the government in complying with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of PWDs \nand the Incheon Strategy to \u201cMake the Right Real\u201d for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the \nPacific, and implementing the new Law on the Rights of PWDs (footnote 6). \n \n13.  The  project  will  have  five  outputs  that  address  the  need  for  services  and  support \nthroughout the life of CWDs and PWDs.17 \n(i)  Output 1: Early identification of children with disabilities strengthened and \ninstitutionalized. The project will (a) institutionalize the early identification model \ninitiated by the MLSP, and (b) facilitate the shift from a medical to a social model in \nidentifying  CWDs  by  broadening  the  skills  of  the  people  involved  in  early \nidentification. The effects of disability can be minimized and possibly prevented by \nappropriately  supported  early  intervention,  and  such  intervention  can  lead  to \ngreater ability and inclusion in education, employment, and society in general. \n(ii)  Output 2: Service delivery for persons with disabilities improved. The project \nwill (a) implement a model of interactive parent\u2013child\u2013facilitator education in early \nchildhood; (b) establish six model aimag development and rehabilitation centers;18 \n(c) establish a disability workforce and introduce national curricula for occupational \nand speech therapy, physiotherapy, orthopedic technicians, and disability social \nworkers;  (d)  strengthen  the  role  of  social  workers  in  support  of  PWDs;  and                \n(e) establish PWD-dedicated hotline on information, counselling, and referrals (for \nPWDs). Early detection supported by appropriate interventions and service delivery \n                                                \n15  As a result of the national parliamentary elections held on 29 June 2016 and the subsequent restructuring of the \ngovernment, the Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection and the Ministry of Labor were merged \ninto one ministry, the MLSP. \n16  The Economic Governance for Equitable Growth Project for Mongolia, a 3-year project of the European Commission \nthat began in August 2015, focuses on macroeconomic planning and comprises social protection and employment. \n17  Except education, as this is being addressed by JICA through its START TA. \n18  Each development and rehabilitation center is staffed with a multidisciplinary team that delivers center-based and \nmobile habilitation and rehabilitation, early intervention, and independent living services for PWDs and CWDs. \n ", "5 \nare the starting point for ensuring access to society, education, and employment for \nCWDs. Early detection and delivery of better and more appropriate services for \nCWDs may also allow family members, especially women, to take an active role in \nthe economy.19 Improved services will include individual case management by \ndisability social workers, portage, physiotherapy, speech and occupational therapy, \nassistive devices, personal assistants, and other independent living services.20 \n(iii)  Output 3: Access to the physical environment improved. This output will         \n(a) develop the capacity of decision makers and strengthen institutions involved in \ndeveloping  and  enforcing  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  on  physical \naccessibility norms (infrastructure, transportation, and information); (b) ensure \nwide inclusion of PWDs in enforcement mechanisms; and (c) ensure access to \naffordable quality orthopedic devices and assistive technology, including in aimags. \nThe  activities  that  will  be  implemented  to  achieve  this  output  will  facilitate \nimplementation of regulations that improve mobility and access to information, \npublic buildings, and transportation. Increased access to assistive devices and \nservices will reduce participation barriers affecting PWDs and enable them to \nengage actively in employment. \n(iv)  Output 4: Work and employment for persons with disabilities improved. This \noutput will (a) set up models to increase PWDs\u2019 skills to enter selected industries \nand improve general job matching and brokerage, (b) facilitate inclusive business \nand  organize  support  systems  for  PWDs  to  access  regular  jobs  and  self-\nemployment, and (c) strengthen participation from PWDs by monitoring employers\u2019 \ncompliance with the PWD employment regulation. The activities will focus on          \n(a) making public employment  and  DPO  service  policies  and  practices more \neffective in creating individual pathways to employment (e.g., case management \nand job coaching); (b) supporting the development of a DPO employment resource \ncenter in Ulaanbaatar (infrastructure, equipment, training, and capacity building) \nthat can provide services to PWDs, employers, and public employment offices; and \n(c) supporting employers and PWDs in the enforcement of legislation regarding \nemployment quotas for PWDs.21 \n(v)  Output  5:  Strategic  development  to  support  persons  with  disabilities \nimplemented. The project will (a) raise awareness and change attitudes toward \nPWDs, (b) reform the welfare system to improve targeting and financial support for \nPWDs to access services and equipment, (c) conduct a strategic review of the \nnational PWD support program, (d) introduce the ICF in line with needs and available \nresources, (e) align National Statistical Office data with information needs in relation \nto disability, and (f) ensure the provision of health insurance coverage to all PWDs. \nIndirect interventions leading to improved inclusion will be achieved through public \ncampaigns to support a gradual change of attitudes toward PWDs, a better \nunderstanding of disability through the introduction of the ICF, and improved \nstatistics and information on challenges faced by PWDs. \n \n                                                \n19 The household socioeconomic survey conducted for the project preparatory TA noted that four out of five caregivers \nare women.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The MLSP will be the executing agency and will oversee overall project implementation \nand  management  activities.  The  MLSP\u2019s  Population  Development  Department  will  be  the \n ", "7 \nimplementing agency for outputs 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be the \nimplementing agency for output 1 and the introduction of the ICF under output 5. The MLSP will \nestablish a project steering committee (PSC) that will (i) provide strategic and policy guidance, \nand general oversight of the project; and (ii) ensure coordination between ministries and other \nstakeholders involved in project implementation. The PSC will be chaired by the MLSP state \nsecretary and will comprise representatives from the Ministry of Finance (MOF); MOH; the Family, \nChildren, and Youth Development Office; Government Office for Labor and Welfare Services; \nRehabilitation and Vocational Training Center; Labor and Social Protection Research Center; and \nthree DPO representatives. The PSC will establish a project steering subcommittee in each of the \nsix target aimags. The MLSP will establish a project implementation unit (PIU) to assume day-to-\nday project management. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and \ndescribed in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).22 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2022 \nEstimated completion  31 December 2022 (loan closing date: 30 June 2023) \ndate \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  The PSC will oversee project implementation and provide strategic direction. It will be \nchaired by the MLSP state secretary and will comprise representatives from the Ministry \nof Finance; MOH; the Family, Children, and Youth Development Office; Government \nOffice for Labor and Welfare Services; Rehabilitation and Vocational Training Center; \nLabor and Social Protection Research Center, and three DPO representatives. The PSC \nwill establish a project steering subcommittee in each of the six target aimags. Each \nsubcommittee will be chaired by the governor and will represent the aimag health, \neducation, and social protection committees and DPOs. \n(ii)  Executing agency  MLSP will be the executing agency and will oversee overall project implementation and \nmanagement activities, including procurement and consultant recruitment. \n(iii)  Key implementing  MLSP\u2019s Population Development Department will implement outputs 2, 3, 4, and 5. \nagencies  MOH will implement output 1 and the introduction of the ICF under output 5. \n(iv)  Implementation  MLSP will establish a PIU that will be responsible for day-to-day project management. \nunit  The PIU will be staffed by a project coordinator, a procurement specialist, a financial \nmanagement specialist, a monitoring and evaluation specialist, and a secretary. The PIU \nwill also include two disability specialists who will oversee the technical aspects of \nimplementation. One will focus on the new multidisciplinary and early childhood \nservices, social welfare reform, and the ICF; and the other on employment, accessibility \nand awareness raising, and attitude change. For each of the six project aimags, PIU will \nrecruit a project subcoordinator responsible for activities implemented in the aimags. \nProcurement  National competitive bidding  24 contracts  $17,639,486 \nShopping  2 contracts  $140,615 \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based  333.5 national and 48.5 international  $1,888,394 \nselection   person-months \nIndividual consultant  19.0 national and 3.5 international  $209,139 \nselection  person-months \nRetroactive financing  Advance contracting will be conducted for civil works and consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n18.  The designs for civil works will exceed Mongolian standards, meet international standards \non universal design and ease of access, and act as a model for future replication in all aimags.23 \nThe design of buildings is made energy efficient through insulation and the use of natural light \nand rooftop photovoltaic systems to reduce recurrent heating and electricity costs. The MLSP will \nprocure the assistive technology and equipment from Mongolian and international suppliers, and \nwill meet or exceed Mongolian standards. Capacity building activities will ensure that equipment \nis operated and maintained by trained orthopedic technicians. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n19.  Economic benefits. The estimated project economic benefits include additional PWDs \nemployed  and  higher  incremental  earnings  for  PWDs.  Other  economic  benefits  were  not \nconsidered because of practical constraints on quantifying them. Estimating benefits over a 20-\nyear period, based on a total project financial cost of $27.27 million, yielded an economic internal \nrate of return of 22.01%, well over the assumed 12.00% economic opportunity cost of capital. The \neconomic internal rate of return of 22.01% is robust in terms of sensitivity to various adverse \nconditions. \n \n20.   Financial sustainability. The project does not generate incremental cash flows, therefore \nthe financial sustainability assessment focused on the fiscal capacity of government to finance \nthe counterpart funding and incremental recurrent costs after completion. The analysis concludes \nthat the government\u2019s budget execution has shown lack of predictability in funds availability and \nin-year reduction in budgets, which could create uncertainty in providing adequate funding for the \nproject\u2019s recurrent costs. To mitigate this risk, the PIU financial management specialist and \nfinance officers in the aimags will monitor the budget process to ensure funds for operation and \nmaintenance  costs  are  included  in  budget  appropriations.  The  legal  agreements  include \ncovenants requiring the government to provide adequate funding for operation and maintenance \ncosts and other recurrent costs of the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n21.   Procurement assessment of the MLSP showed that it has adequate capacity to conduct \nprocurement in compliance with national laws and regulations on public procurement, and \nexperience  in  procurement  using  ADB  policies  and  procedures.  The  MLSP\u2019s  procurement \ncapacity will be strengthened by recruiting a procurement specialist for the PIU. \n \n22.   Financial management assessments conducted for the MLSP and MOH, confirmed that \nthey have adequate qualified accountants, and computerized financial accounting and reporting \nsystems and procedures supporting their current project activities. The overall assessment of \nproject financial management risk was moderate. The assessments identified weaknesses in \nbudget planning and execution, accounting, staffing, internal auditing, asset management, and \nthe management information system. ADB will address these weaknesses by providing training \nfor, and strengthening the capacity of, the MLSP and MOH staff through the PIU. The PIU will be \nequipped  with  an  integrated  financial  management  system  and  staffed  by  qualified \n                                                \n23 International Organization for Standardization (ISO).

Annual  project  audits  will  be  arranged  by  the \nMongolian National Audit Office and MOF and will be conducted through private audit firms \nsubcontracted by the Mongolian National Audit Office and MOF. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  MLSP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 22). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  PWDs and their families are a population subgroup whose poverty rates are more than \ntwice those of general population, and only one-quarter of PWDs are in the labor force. In general, \nPWDs have significantly lower human development indicators, and higher level of vulnerabilities \nand social exclusion than the general population. The project will directly benefit PWDs by \nproviding them with job opportunities and more support through social welfare reform. Some \nproject components will focus on regions where more than 50% of PWDs live in poverty. It is \nexpected that at least 10,000 PWDs will benefit from improved employment services, and by 2022 \nat least 5,000 more PWDs will enter the labor market than in 2014. Social welfare reforms will \nbenefit 400,000 people living in households with at least one PWD, providing more equitable and \naccessible social assistance programs. Finally, it is estimated that 17,000 CWDs and 62,000 \nPWDs  will  benefit  from  early  identification  and  improved  services  provided  through  the \ndevelopment and rehabilitation centers in the project target areas. More than 10 DPOs will be \ninvolved in public communications campaigns, employment and work support, and monitoring of \nall project implementation activities as part of the PSC. \n \n25.  Gender benefits. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming and a gender \naction plan has been prepared. Early identification of disabilities, delivery of support services, and \nemployment  services  include  gender-sensitive  approaches  and  ensure  equal  participation. \nCommunication campaigns are planned to address gender inequities and reform of social welfare \nto provide better protection and social services for caregivers. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows: B for environment and category C for involuntary resettlement and \nindigenous peoples following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project will not have \nnegative impact on indigenous peoples in the project areas, and will not require temporary or \npermanent land acquisition.24 The MLSP reviewed the project\u2019s environmental implications, \nconducted an initial environmental examination, and developed an environmental management \nplan (EMP) to address minor adverse environmental impacts (dust, noise, and construction site \nsafety)  that  may  potentially  occur  during  the  establishment  of  six  small  development  and \nrehabilitation centers in aimags and one DPO employment resource center in Ulaanbaatar. All \nbuildings will meet relevant health and safety standards, adhere to universal design principles, \nand incorporate energy efficiency measures.25 Water, wastewater, and solid-waste services will \nbe connected to existing municipal services. The EMP defines the environmental management \n                                                \n24 Construction of six aimag development and rehabilitation centers and the DPO employment resource center in \nUlaanbaatar will be done on identified government-owned land. \n25 All buildings will be equipped with rooftop photovoltaic systems. \n ", "10 \nrequirements and responsibilities throughout the design and establishment of the facilities. The \nEMP is attached to the PAM and will be incorporated in the civil work contracts. The PIU will \nmonitor and supervise EMP implementation performance. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n27.  The overall benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nMajor risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.26 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nLack of recurrent funding jeopardizes  The MLSP has guaranteed funding for recurrent costs. The Law on the \nthe provision of quality services for  Rights of PWDs and strong DPO advocacy will support adequate funding. \nPWDs in the long-term  Legal covenants to ensure funding commitment were added in the loan \nagreement. \nCompanies show resistance in  The MLSP will (i) strengthen public and DPO employment services to \nemploying PWDs  better prepare and support PWDs in work placements, and to prepare staff \nand the physical environment in the workplace; (ii) conduct information \ncampaigns and guidance targeting employers; and (iii) strengthen \nenforcement of the quota regulation. \nMedical profession resists changes in  Responsibilities will be shared.

ASSURANCES \n \n28.  The government and MLSP have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n \n29.  The government and MLSP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n30.   I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $25,000,000  \nto Mongolia for the Ensuring Inclusiveness and Service Delivery for Persons with Disabilities \nProject, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in concessional terms, with an interest charge at \nthe rate of 2% per year during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n7 November 2017 \n                                                \n26 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nEqual participation for PWDs in society achieved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030)a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2023    Inadequate budget \nAccess to services  a. 90% of CWDs enrolled in a portage  a.
