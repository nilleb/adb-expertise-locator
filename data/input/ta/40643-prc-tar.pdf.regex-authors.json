INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the country program midterm review for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nundertaken in April 2007, the Government confirmed its request for assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to finance the proposed Xinjiang Urban Transport and Environmental \nImprovement Project. The project will improve urban infrastructure facilities including roads and \ntraffic management facilities in five cities: Altay in the northwest border area, and Changji, Hami, \nKuytun,  and  Turpan  along  a  major  transport  corridor  in  north  Xinjiang  Uygur  Autonomous \nRegion (XUAR). ADB is currently processing the Xinjiang Regional Road Improvement Project,1 \nthe subject of which is the expressway linking Urumqi, the capital of XUAR, to southern Xinjiang \nand  to  its  border  ports  with  Central  Asia;  and  the  Xinjiang  Municipal  Infrastructure  and \nEnvironmental Improvement Project,2 which covers two border cities (Yining and Tacheng), the \nLand Port of Alashankou, and the Kanas National Nature Reserve Area. Both projects are \nscheduled to be considered by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2008. \n \n2.  The proposed project is included in the 2009 lending program and a project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA) is scheduled for processing in 2007.3  ADB\u2019s Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited the project area in March\u2013April 2007; held discussions with the central Government, the \ngovernment  of  XUAR  (XUARG),  and  other  stakeholders  in  each  project  city;  carried  out \nanalyses  for  preparing  a  design  and  monitoring  framework,  an  initial  poverty  and  social \nassessment, initial safeguards assessments and categorization; and collected other necessary \ninformation. This report is based on the understanding reached with the Government regarding \nthe impact and outcome, methodology and key activities, cost estimates, financing plan, and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA, as well as the Mission\u2019s observations in the field.   \n \nII.   ISSUES \n3.  XUAR is located in the northwest part of the PRC. It is the country\u2019s largest region with \nan area of 1.66 million square kilometers (1/6 or 16.7% of the country\u2019s total area) but a \nrelatively small population of 20 million (1.5% of the PRC population), comprising Han Chinese \nand other ethnic groups, the largest of which is the Uygur.  Xinjiang is the gateway between the \nPRC and the Central Asian republics. As a major transport corridor of the historic Silk Road, \nXinjiang has a wealth of history and ethnic culture that has promoted tourism development. The \nregion is also rich in natural resources including oil, metals, and minerals that provide a sound \nbasis for economic development. However, Xinjiang remains one of the poorest parts of the \ncountry. Of the 86 counties in XUAR, 27 are categorized as national poverty counties. In 2006, \nabout  13.4%  of  Xinjiang\u2019s  population  lived  on  incomes  below  the  official  poverty  line  as \ncompared with the 3.4% national average poverty incidence.4 In an effort to maximize the \ndevelopment potential of Xinjiang and to raise the living standard of the people, the Government \nhas accorded high priority to support for the sustainable economic development of Xinjiang, \nparticularly  border  cities  and  cities  along  major  transport  corridors.  At  the  same  time  the \nGovernment is concerned to protect the environment.  ADB actively supports5  this initiative and \nhas recommended, among others, that the Western Region Development Strategy should focus \non  accelerating  infrastructure  development  (transport,  communications,  power,  and  water \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Xinjiang Regional Road \nImprovement Project.  Manila (TA 4773\u2013PRC). The TA draft final report was completed in October 2006. \n2 ADB  2006.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Xinjiang  Municipal \nInfrastructure and Environmental Improvement Project.  Manila (TA 4805\u2013PRC).  The TA began in March 2007. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 April 2007.  \n4  The official poverty line in 2005 was CNY958 per capita per year, which is lower than the international standard of \n$1 per capita per day.  \n5  ADB. 2005.

Manila (TA 4727\u2013PRC). \n ", "2   \nresources) and environmental protection to lay the foundation for sustainable development. This \nproject, together with the Xinjiang Regional Road Development Project and Xinjiang Municipal \nInfrastructure  and  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (footnotes  1  and  2)  that  are  under \npreparation, fully supports this strategy. \n \n4.   XUAR shares borders with Afghanistan, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nPakistan, Russian Federation, and Tajikistan. XUAR and its neighboring countries have many \ncultural similarities and economic complementarities. It is abundantly endowed with natural \nresources.  Considering  these  advantages,  XUAR\u2019s  development  strategy  focuses  on  its \npotential role in and contribution to the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nprogram. To benefit from these opportunities and maximize potentials for strong growth, there is \na  need  to  improve  urban  infrastructure,  including  roads,  water  supply,  power, \ntelecommunications, and environmental services. The project cities plan to use other sources to \nfinance urban utility services and have requested ADB\u2019s assistance in supporting their urban \nroads development and traffic management programs through the proposed project. \n \n5.  Several major internationally supported infrastructure projects are under construction or \nwere completed recently in XUAR: Tarim Basin Water Conservancy and Agriculture Support \n(World Bank), Kuytun to Syimlake Expressway (World Bank), Urumqi Urban Transportation \nImprovement  (World  Bank),  and  Yining  City  Environment  Management  (Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Cooperation).  However,  the  present  roads  infrastructure  and  transport \nmanagement and services are inadequate to meet the increasing traffic and utility service \ndemands  in  the  project  cities.  The  incomplete  roads  networks,  low  standard  of  transport \ninfrastructure, low flow capacity at surface intersections, poor road maintenance, absence of \nsegregation  of  transport  types,  and  inadequate  traffic  management  all  contribute  to  traffic \ncongestion,  accidents,  and  increased  air  pollution  from  emissions.    In  addition,  restricted \nvehicular access limits the effectiveness of government services, including solid waste collection \nand emergency services particularly for fires. Lack of utility service corridors constrains the \nnecessary expansion of water supply networks and sewerage systems, resulting in reliance on \nunsafe groundwater and the discharge of pollutants to the ground. Public health and property \nare thus put at risk. \n \n6.  The proposed project consists of five components involving the construction of new \nroads, upgrading the existing inadequate roads, and improving traffic planning and management \nand road safety in the cities of Altay, Changji, Hami, Kuytun, and Turpan.  All have approved \ndevelopment master plans and programs that the project will directly support. The five project \ncomponents are similar in content and seek to  (i) improve the existing road infrastructure to \nrelieve traffic congestion and accidents; (ii) assist commercial access to transshipment trade \nand improve urban living conditions; (iii) facilitate improvement and expansion of urban utility \nservices to the city population; (iv) enable enhanced environmental protection and management \nwithin the growing urban areas; and (v) extend roads (and associated utility services) into new \ndevelopment areas of the city to support increased industrial activity, raise the level of the local \neconomy, increase employment, and reduce the incidence of poverty. A rapid environmental \nassessment has been carried out and a category A assessment is proposed to ensure that the \nproject will minimize adverse environmental impacts on the affected people and maximize the \nenvironmental benefits to the project cities and their residents. \n \n7.  The total length of roads to be constructed is about 168 kilometers of varying widths and \ncapacities.  Included are eight bridge structures totaling 340 meters in length. Main roads will \nincorporate bicycle paths, footpaths, bus stop sheds, and landscape strips. All roads will include \nlighting, signage, and traffic controls. Associated utility services will be provided along off-road \ncorridors, but the services will be constructed under separate projects to be financed from \n ", "  3\ndomestic and other sources and implemented in conjunction with the ADB-financed project. \nRoad construction will involve total land acquisition of about 287 hectares and resettlement of \nabout 2,100 households. Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples assessments have \nbeen undertaken, and the conclusion is that category A is applicable to both. \n \n8.  The  project  will  focus  on  providing  sustainable  municipal  infrastructure,  increased \neconomic activity and employment, and protecting the environment to foster rapid economic \ngrowth in the northern and western regions of XUAR. Importantly, it will bring tangible benefits \nto the project cities\u2019 environment by improving urban air quality and reducing road accidents, \nvehicular  emissions,  and  dust  through  more  efficient  road  networks,  integrated  traffic \nmanagement  operations,  and  road  safety  education  and  measures.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to provide a loan of $100 million to support the project, which will be the second \nADB-financed municipal development and environmental protection project in XUAR (footnote \n2). The project supports ADB\u2019s country strategy for the PRC, particularly the priority given to \nmaking  markets  work  more  efficiently  through  infrastructure  development  and  promoting \nenvironmental sustainability, and is consistent with its CAREC strategy. The project will support \nthe  poor  by  raising  levels  of  the  local  economy,  improving  environmental  protection,  and \nreducing the incidence of pollution and risk to health; and supports the national and regional \ninfrastructure development strategies as well as the ADB urban sector strategy. The experience \ngained  from  similar  investment  projects  in  medium-sized  and  small  urban  centers  in \nenvironmentally  sensitive  provinces\u2015including  Anhui,  Fujian,  Guangxi,  Hebei,  Heilongjiang, \nHenan, Jilin, and Shandong\u2015and the knowledge generated from various policy-oriented studies \nhave been incorporated in the design.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n   \n9.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  preparing  the  Xinjiang  Urban  Transport  and \nEnvironmental Improvement Project. The project will enhance public infrastructure, increase \nenvironmental protection, and raise the living standards of the population in Xinjiang regional \ncities by improvements to local road networks and traffic management. It will also facilitate the \nprovision  of  associated  utility  services  and  improve  access  for  emergency  services  (fire, \nambulance, and police) in the five cities. The TA will assist XUARG to (i) review and identify the \nmost appropriate urban road infrastructure developments to improve public access, facilitate \ntrade and enterprise, reduce road accidents, and improve the urban environment; (ii) prepare a \nfeasibility study for each of the five components; and (iii) prepare an urban transport and \nenvironmental improvement project, including environmental impact assessment, environmental \nmanagement plan, social analysis, indigenous peoples development plan, and resettlement plan \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s policy and guidelines. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1, lasting 1 month, will comprise \nstudies  to  (i)  review  and  assess  the  current  shortcomings  and  constraints  to  economic \ndevelopment and adverse environmental impacts imposed by the lack of appropriate road \nnetworks in the cities; (ii) review the Government\u2019s economic and environmental development \nstrategies, priorities, and investment plans for the northwest region; (iii) identify the problems \nand urgency of mitigating needs relating to urban road infrastructure in the project cities; (iv) \nreview the likely resettlement impact of the project; (v) develop a project design and monitoring \nframework  (DMF)  taking  into  consideration  the  economic,  financial,  social,  environmental \n ", "4   \nimpacts of the project; and (vi) prepare an inception report.  During phase 2, lasting for 2.5 \nmonths, the TA will (i) assess the potential impacts of the components based on technical, \ninstitutional, environmental, social and ethnic, economic, financial, and other relevant factors; (ii) \nformulate  balanced  urban  roads  infrastructure  development  and  pollution  control  strategies \ncomprising structural  and  nonstructural  measures;  (iii)  update  feasibility  studies of  the  five \ncomponents; (iv) assist XUAR to prepare (and/or strengthen the existing) draft environmental \nimpact assessment, resettlement and indigenous peoples plans according to ADB\u2019s guidelines \nand policies, and conduct public consultation meetings and disclosure of relevant information; (v) \nrefine the DMF through a stakeholder workshop in each project city; and (vi) prepare an interim \nreport. Phase 3 for 2.5 months, will assist XUAR to (i) formulate an overall investment project for \nADB  funding;  (ii)  consolidate  feasibility  study  reports  prepared  in  phase  2;  (iii)  formulate \nprocurement needs and corresponding procurement arrangements; (iv) justify the project in \nfinancial, economic, social, and environmental terms; and (v) prepare a draft final report. An \ninitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n11.  XUARG has limited experience with internationally funded projects and the implementing \nagencies  in  the  project  cities  have  no  experience  with  ADB  procedures.  Therefore  the \nconsultant  will  provide  appropriate  training  both  as  a  continuous  exercise  during    project \npreparation  and,  specifically,  in  three  2-day  workshops  covering  the  following  subjects:  (i) \nprocurement, (ii) environmental impact assessment and environmental management planning, \n(iii)  project  performance  monitoring  system,  (iv)  management  information  systems,  (v) \nresettlement plans, and (vi) indigenous peoples and social assessment. The workshops will be \nheld after the inception report has been finalized. \n \n12.  Major risks to the successful implementation of the TA include (i) inadequate counterpart \nsupport and performance, (ii) lack of adequate and timely provision of necessary data, (iii) delay \nin submitting required studies, (iv) delay in appointing and mobilizing consultants and design \ninstitutes, and (v) inadequate performance by the consultants and design institutes. To mitigate \nthese risks, the recruitment and performance of the consultants and design institutes will be \nmonitored closely. The Government has agreed to provide adequate counterpart support and all \nnecessary  data  according  to  an  agreed-upon  timetable.  Close  coordination  among  the \nconsultants, executing and implementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $900,000 equivalent. It is proposed that \n$700,000 be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will \nprovide the balance of local costs, equivalent to $200,000, to cover in-kind counterpart costs \nand  services  including  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  furniture,  administrative  support  and \ninterpretation  services,  logistics  and  local  (city)  transportation.  The  Government  has  been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project or to \nextend  any  further  technical  assistance  with  respect  to  the  implementation  of  any \nrecommendations of the TA. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.   XUARG will be the Executing Agency for the TA. It has established a project leading \ngroup, chaired by a vice governor, to provide overall guidance and support to the proposed \nproject.  A  project  management  office  (PMO)  comprising  the  Xinjiang  Finance  Bureau, \n ", "  5\nDevelopment and Reform Commission, and Construction Bureau, has been established6 and \nreports to the project leading group.  The PMO will maintain interdepartmental coordination, \nensure the study team\u2019s access to relevant information and data, liaise with ADB on matters \nrelating to TA implementation, and facilitate socioeconomic, poverty and other surveys required. \nThe  PMO  is  led  by  a  director  and  has  three  experienced  professional  staff,  including  an \ninterpreter/translator, who will work with the consultants on a full-time basis. \n \n15.  The TA will be carried out over a 6-month period and is expected to start in December \n2007 and be completed in June 2008.  A total of 47.5 person-months of consulting services (19 \ninternational  and  28.5  national)  will  be  required.  The  international  consultants  will  provide \nexpertise in transport planning and management, roads engineering and road safety, financial \nand economic analyses, resettlement planning and social impact analysis (poverty, gender, and \nindigenous peoples), institutional capacity development, and environmental impact assessment. \nThe  national  consultants  will  have  expertise  in  transport  planning,  road  and  transport \nengineering,  civil  and  geotechnical  engineering,  project  economic  and  financial  analyses, \nenvironmental protection, socioeconomic analysis and resettlement, and institutional and legal \naspects for urban development. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  An international consulting firm in association with national consultants will be engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of national consultants. \nADB will select and engage consultants on the basis of the quality of the proposal (80%) and \nthe cost (20%) of the services to be provided (the standard quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod) using simplified technical proposal procedures. All reports by the consultants will be \nprepared  in  English  and  translated  into  Chinese.  The  consultants  will  maintain  close \nrelationships with ADB and XUARG and regularly discuss progress and findings. Tripartite \nmeetings involving XUARG, ADB staff, and the consultants will be held in Urumqi city to provide \nguidance to the consultants and to review their reports. \n \n17.  The PMO will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication \naccess,  city-level  transport  (excluding  transport  between  project  locations)  for  consultants, \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents required by the TA, and will cover the cost of utilities for \nthe use of the consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff. The TA equipment \nwill be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and transferred to XUARG upon the completion of the TA. \n \nIV  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Xinjiang Urban Transport \nand Environmental Improvement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n6  The PMO is established to serve both the Xinjiang Municipal and Environmental Improvement Project (TA 4805) \nand the proposed project. \n ", "  6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced urban  Public satisfaction with  Annual socioeconomic  \u2022  Project design and \nenvironment and living  the environment and  surveys undertaken as  construction are \nstandards in Xinjiang  health increased (to be  part of the PPMS.  implemented effectively. \nregional cities (Altay,  quantified when baseline     \nChangyi, Hami, Kuytun,  has been established).

Design and Monitoring Framework \n3.  In consultation with government agencies, and the public and project stakeholders, the \nconsultants will develop, through workshops and meetings, a design and monitoring framework for \nthe project that outlines the impact, outcomes, outputs, and inputs or activities. The consultants will \ndevelop baseline traffic, environmental, and social indicators (including health and other relevant \ndata) necessary to effectively monitor project performance, and will collect baseline indicators as \nappropriate. The project framework will be developed using a problem-tree analysis. It will be \nbased on a participatory approach1 involving beneficiaries and stakeholders in project development, \nwhich will form the basis for the project performance management systems (PPMS) and risk and \nsensitivity analysis.  \n \nD.  Training \n4.  The Executing Agency, XUARG, has limited experience with internationally funded projects, \nand  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  have  no  experience  with  ADB  procedures.    Therefore  the \nconsultant will provide appropriate training as a continuous exercise during project preparation, \nspecifically  in  two  workshops  that  will  cover  the  following  subjects:  (i)  procurement;  (ii) \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA)  and  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  during \nproject preparation and project implementation; (iii) PPMS; (iv) management information systems; \n(v) resettlement plans (RPs); and (vi) indigenous peoples and social assessment. The workshops \nwill be held immediately after the issue of the inception and interim reports. \n                                                 \n1 Starting with city workshops during the initial TA Fact-finding Mission in March-April 2007. \n ", "                    Appendix 4  13 \nE.
