In October 2004, Director, Area B, Pacific Department, attended the Pacific \nParliamentarians\u2019 meeting on HIV/AIDS in Suva, Fiji Islands and discussed common issues of \nconcern with representatives of a number of Pacific governments, development partners, and \nregional  agencies,  including  the  Pacific  Islands  Forum  and  the  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific \nCommunity (SPC). In January 2005, a mission participated in the SPC Regional Strategy on \nHIV/AIDS Implementation meeting, and consulted with key Pacific regional stakeholders in \nHIV/AIDS.  These  consultations  formed  the  basis  of  this  proposal  for  regional  technical \nassistance (TA) including the TA purpose, key activities, consultants\u2019 terms of reference, cost \nestimates, and financing. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 The concept clearance was \napproved by the Vice President, Operations 2, on 3 March 2005. \n \n2.  All Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) have been invited to participate in the \nassistance. Activities under the TA will only commence in a particular country when ADB has \nreceived the no-objection to the inclusion of the DMC from the concerned government. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  State of the Epidemic \n \n3.  In the Pacific, the HIV/AIDS epidemic is firmly established and is growing rapidly. While \nmost infections to date have been in Papua New Guinea and the Fiji Islands, other Pacific \ncountries\u2014Cook  Islands,  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  (FSM),  Kiribati,  Nauru,  Palau, \nRepublic  of  the  Marshall  Islands  (RMI),  Samoa,  Solomon  Islands,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and \nVanuatu\u2014remain vulnerable to the epidemic, due to their small size, high level of mobility within \nand outside the region, lack of knowledge about the infection among the general population, \nand inadequate health sector infrastructure. There has been a rapid increase in the number of \nreported cases of HIV in almost all countries in the region. However, it is widely believed that \nthese  numbers  may  be  underestimated,  due  to  almost  nonexistent  surveillance  and  weak \ncapacity to diagnose the infection. \n \nB.  Current Response to the Epidemic \n \n4.  ADB has an important role to play in combating this epidemic. Controlling and reversing \nthe spread of the disease is one of the Millennium Development Goals. Support for social \nservices, including HIV/AIDS-related activities, is one of the three pillars of the Pacific Strategy. \n \n5.  ADB has responded to the crisis with a program of activities in HIV/AIDS both at regional \nand country levels. A draft strategic approach paper, \u201cStrategic Directions for ADB\u2019s Response \nto HIV/AIDS in the Asia and Pacific Region,\u201d addressing the overall objectives and strategy of \nADB, is in development. This strategy identifies three priorities for action: leadership support, \ncapacity development, and targeted programs to mitigate the risk among poor and vulnerable \ngroups. In the ADF IX replenishment, donors agreed to establish a grant program to combat \nHIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases. ADB and UNAIDS committed to a memorandum of \nunderstanding in February 2005 which will foster cooperation according to an agreed set of \nprinciples and actions. \n                                                 \n1  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 February 2005. ", "2 \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s regional strategy for the Pacific will support national efforts to prevent and control \nHIV/AIDS  and  strengthen  work  at  the  regional  level  through  improved  coordination, \ncollaboration, and partnership between regional organizations and national programs. It will also \nsupport national efforts to prevent and control HIV/AIDS and national efforts against other \nsexually  transmitted  infections  (STIs).  A  regional  TA3  is  under  way  which  will  assess  the \nsituation of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific and identify appropriate interventions for ADB over the \nmedium term. A regional approach to HIV/AIDS in all but Papua New Guinea and Timor-Leste is \nproposed as it offers potential economies of scale and opportunities for comparative analysis \nand  learning  that  would  not  necessarily  be available  through  a  series  of  discrete  national \napproaches.  Since  the  countries  in  the  Pacific  vary  in  their  efforts  to  prevent  and  control \nHIV/AIDS,  a  regional  approach  affords  an  opportunity  for  Pacific  governments  and  other \nstakeholders to share these approaches and to learn from each other\u2019s experiences. This will \nalso facilitate development of regional networks and surveillance systems, enabling them to \ncontinue learning into the future. \n \n7.  The leaders of 22 Pacific Island Countries and Territories endorsed a Pacific Regional \nStrategy on HIV/AIDS (2004\u22122008), at the 35th Pacific Islands Forum meeting in August 2004, \nheld in Apia, Samoa. The leaders recognized that the need to address HIV/AIDS in the region is \nurgent and in endorsing the strategy, called for a detailed implementation plan to be developed \nby the SPC. \n \n8.  UNAIDS has a program of activities in the Pacific managed by an office based in Suva, \nFiji Islands. The Global Fund Round 2 allocation for the Pacific Islands Region was $3 million \nover 2 years. A 5-year regional proposal aimed at reducing STI prevalence to under 10% and \nmaintaining HIV prevalence among high-risk populations at under 2% in 11 Pacific small island \ncountries is under way. A regional submission is being prepared for the Global Fund\u2019s Round 5 \nallocation. \n \n9.  AusAID  has  a  significant  contribution  with  the  Pacific  Regional  HIV/AIDS  Project \ndesigned  to  help  strengthen  capacity  of  Pacific  island  governments,  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  and  communities  to  develop,  implement,  and  evaluate  multisector \nresponses to HIV/AIDS. The project provides funds to contribute to national HIV/AIDS/STI \nstrategic plans and supports the functioning of national AIDS councils. NZAID also funds a \nnumber of HIV/AIDS activities, supporting NGOs and UNAIDS. \n \nC.  Identified Gaps in the Response \n \n10.  As with many social sector issues in the Pacific, there is a lack of good data and \ninformation about the epidemic. Effective advocacy with policy makers and leaders is contingent \non a sound knowledge base and targeted and widespread dissemination of that knowledge. \nGaps exist in a number of areas. There is little known about the socioeconomic impacts of \nHIV/AIDS in the Pacific. Where HIV/AIDS is gaining ground as an issue at all, it is seen largely \nas a health issue. As a social issue it is perceived to be confined to marginalized groups such \nas sex workers.  \n \n11.  There is a need for research to be undertaken to assess the possible impacts of the \nepidemic on Pacific economies, including the impact on health budgets. While HIV/AIDS impact \nassessments  are  now  more  commonly  undertaken  in  high-prevalence  countries,  no  such \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2004. Small-Scale Technical Assistance for HIV/AIDS in the Pacific: ADB\u2019s Response. Manila. ", "    3 \nstudies have been undertaken in the Pacific. Awareness is growing that the movement of the \ndisease into the general community could have a devastating impact on the health sector in \nparticular, as well as on the macroeconomy. This needs to be studied. Socioeconomic impact \nindicators  need  to  be  reviewed  in  the  context  of  low  to  medium  prevalence  rates.  Key \ndemographic, sector, and macro impacts need to be identified and potential future impacts \nestimated according to various prevalence scenarios. \n \n12.  There is also a need to assess the possible impacts at community, household, and \nindividual levels, particularly in regard to the poor. Many PDMCs have committed to addressing \npoverty and hardship. All have committed to the Millennium Development Goals with their \npoverty reduction and HIV/AIDS targets. There is little or no information in the Pacific about the \neffect HIV/AIDS could have on those efforts. \n \n13.  The  impact  of  AIDS  on  poverty  at  the  individual  and  household  levels  has  been \nacknowledged and explored in various regions. The link between AIDS and poverty is complex. \nPoverty increases the risk of infection because of the probability of participation in high-risk \nbehavior and the reduced effectiveness of prevention campaigns. It decreases the likelihood of \naccess to care and treatment programs. Conversely, HIV/AIDS infection causes households \nand individuals to incur increased expenditure and to forgo income-generating opportunities. \nThose already in poverty have reduced chances of escaping it and those above the poverty line \nhave an increased likelihood of falling into it. It is important for decision makers to understand \nwhether these micro-level impacts aggregate and influence national poverty indicators.  \n \n14.  Research needs to be undertaken to identify high-risk groups and the likely impact that \nthe epidemic could have on them. Pacific seafarers are a particularly high-risk group, traveling \nthroughout  the  Pacific  and  to  countries  with  high  HIV  prevalence.  Kiribati  and  Tuvalu  for \nexample, provide considerable human resources to international shipping. In both countries the \nearnings  from  seafarers  alone  constitute  about  25%  of  gross  domestic  product.  Greater \nunderstanding  of  mobility  patterns  and  of  vulnerability  related  to  mobility  in  the  Pacific  is \nessential for prevention interventions to be prioritized and implemented.  \n \n15.  Broadening the knowledge base among key policy makers and influencers is essential \nfor appropriate and timely responses to the epidemic. In October 2005, UNAIDS is organizing \nthe  first  regional  Pacific  HIV/AIDS  conference  since  1999.  The  conference  has  several \nobjectives: (i) to provide a regional platform for the Pacific to share information and education on \nvarious HIV/AIDS issues; (ii) to provide the opportunity for publicity and media events to raise \nthe profile of HIV/AIDS in the region; (iii) to build on current relationships and support between \nPacific  regional  stakeholders  and  New  Zealand\u2019s  and  Australia\u2019s  programs;  (iv) to  improve \nknowledge generally in the region; and (v) to improve the relationships between Pacific partners \nand leaders to assist with improved strategies for support and prevention programs for difficult \nto reach populations. A critical component of the conference will be a set of commissioned \nresearch papers with a specific Pacific focus. The conference will be a critical forum for raising \nthe awareness of HIV/AIDS issues. \n \n16.  UNAIDS has approached ADB for support for the conference. NZAID and UNAIDS are \nproviding some financial support for the conference. UNAIDS is actively pursuing the private \nsector to provide sponsorship. There is a need for a significant level of additional funding to  \nensure the success of the conference. \n \n ", "4 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The goal of the assistance is to strengthen the regional response to HIV/AIDS in the \nPacific. The purpose is to enhance technical knowledge in HIV/AIDS programs and policies, \nparticularly in regard to the socioeconomic aspects of the epidemic, and to raise awareness and \nincrease understanding among key decision makers in PDMCs of the critical HIV/AIDS issues. \n \n18.  The first output component of the assistance will be three analytical studies: (i) poverty \nand HIV/AIDS in three Pacific countries; (ii) economic impact of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific; and \n(iii) high-risk  behavior  study  on  Pacific  seafarers.  The  outlines  of  the  three  studies  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n19.  The  second  output  component  will  be  support  for  a  Pacific  regional  conference  of \nleaders, key stakeholders, and development partners. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n20.  The main activities of the analytical studies are desk reviews of available data, analysis, \nand report writing. Frameworks for the studies are as follows: \n \n(i)  The study on poverty and HIV/AIDS in three Pacific countries. This study will \nassess the impact of AIDS on poverty at the individual and household levels by \nlooking at expenditure and income effects associated with HIV/AIDS including \nincreases  in  health  spending  and  funeral  expenses;  and  reduction  in  hours \nworked by people living with HIV/AIDS or by their caregivers. The study will \nassess household coping strategies such as consumption smoothing, use of \nsavings,  sale  of  assets,  borrowing,  and  changes  in  household  living \narrangements.  The  study  will  simulate  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS-related \nexpenditure  and  income  effects  on  the  consumption  expenditure  of  these \nhouseholds and to project the aggregate impact on HIV/AIDS on poverty in the \nthree countries between 2005 and 2015. \n(ii)  Economic impact of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific. This study will assess the economic \nimpact of the epidemic and include analysis of the burden at the national level, \nwith particular attention to the health sector in regard to the cost of prevention, \ncare, and treatment, the education sector for impact on demand for and supply of \neducation, the impact on business in relation to supply of labor and skill levels, \nand impact on demand for goods and services. \n(iii)  High-risk behavior study on the Pacific seafarers. This study will analyze the \nbehavior of Pacific seafarers and produce a risk assessment. The study will \nutilize available data from existing surveys. Interviews and focus groups will also \nbe conducted. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $380,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $300,000 \nand the balance of $80,000 equivalent will be provided by UNAIDS through the provision of \ncounterpart staff, support services, and office facilities. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Appendix 3 presents detailed cost estimates and the financing \nplan. ", "    5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  assistance.  For  both  components,  the \nanalytical studies, and support for the UNAIDS conference, PAHQ will be the implementing \nagency. The expected duration of the TA is 6 months, commencing in May 2005 and ending in \nOctober 2005. \n \n23.  UNAIDS  has  procured  the  services  of  the  Australasian  Society  for  HIV  Medicine \n(ASHM), a regional NGO to organize the conference. Other financiers of the conference will \nalso be engaging ASHM\u2019s services. ADB will directly select ASHM to provide the services \nrequired under the conference component. \n \n24.  For the analytical studies component, ADB will engage three individual consultants for a \ntotal of 7 person-months. The poverty study will be undertaken by a consultant with expertise in \npoverty analysis and HIV/AIDS and will require inputs of 2 person-months. The economic \nimpact study will be undertaken by a consultant with expertise in economic impact assessments \nand will require inputs of 2.5 person-months. The study on seafarers will be undertaken by a \nconsultant with expertise in behavior assessments of vulnerable populations and will require \ninputs of 2.5 person-months. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. The consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n25.  Dissemination of outputs.  The analytical studies will be presented at the UNAIDS \nregional conference and will be published separately by ADB as part of the Pacific Studies \nSeries. The outputs from the conference will be published by UNAIDS following the conference. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nSocioeconomic Implications of HIV/AIDS in the Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n    Data   \n \nPerformance  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nTargets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nStrengthened regional  Increase in budgetary  Government budget  Political commitment for \nresponse to HIV/AIDS in  support for HIV/AIDS  statements.
