INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to improve efficiency in public \nservice procurement, provision, and financing.1 A TA fact-finding mission on 25\u201326 March 2014 \nreached  agreement  with  the government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, costs, financial arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services of \nthe TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Accelerating urbanization and an aging population have increased the need for public \nservices in the PRC. Although the quality and quantity of public services have improved along \nwith  the  country\u2019s  continued  economic  growth,  their  provision  has  not  met  expanding  or \nchanging  needs.  The  government  highlighted  the  importance  of  improving  public  service \nprocurement,  provision,  and  financing  at  the  Third  Plenary  Session  of  the  18th  Central \nCommittee of the Chinese Communist Party in November 2013. This policy direction was further \nsupported by the decision made by the Politburo on 30 June 2014.3 Also, the latest amendment \nof the Budget Law will strengthen budget management both at the central and local levels to \nmeet their expenditure responsibilities.4 \n \n3.  The Third Plenary Session stressed the importance of strengthening the role of the \nmarket and facilitating private sector engagement in the public sector to efficiently expand public \nservices.5 The government also placed importance on reforming the tax system to strengthen \nfiscal capacity to support the increase in public service provision, with particular attention paid to \nthe issue of property tax, which would be a stable fiscal resource for local governments. To \nmeet social needs, the government also stressed the importance of reforming the minimum \nliving guarantee system by standardizing its system design and adjusting benefit levels. To fulfill \nthose needs on public services, key challenges are (i) efficiency in public service procurement, \n(ii) development of a stable fiscal source to finance public services, and (iii) efficiency in the \ndelivery and financing of the minimum living guarantee. \n \nA.  Improve Efficiency in Public Service Procurement \n \n4.  In the PRC, local governments are largely responsible for social service provision, such \nas health care and old-age care, while the central government is responsible for policy making, \nlegislation, regulation, and supervision. Given the increased demand for public services, it is \ninefficient and unrealistic to expect the governments to be entirely responsible for providing \npublic services, including planning, regulating, financing, delivering, and monitoring the services. \nA key for efficient public service provision will be to engage the private sector in public service \nprovision through procurement.6 \n \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2014. County Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 June 2014. \n3  The Politburo stressed the importance of reforming the three policy agenda: (i) budget management, (ii) tax \nreforms, and (iii) intergovernmental fiscal transfers. \n4  The amended Budget Law was approved on 31 August 2014, and will come into effective on 1 January 2015. \n5  The Third Plenary Session approved a decision that promotes public service procurement by contracting with the \nprivate sector. \n6  The private sector includes nonprofit organizations. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  While the PRC has been an active user of private sector engagement in the public \nsector since the early 1990s, this engagement has been used mostly for infrastructure projects. \nAlthough public service provision is a good potential area to engage the private sector, the \nexperience has been limited in the PRC. Private sector engagement in public service provision \nwould increase efficiency in the use of available resources and induce policy reforms that would \nreallocate roles, incentives, and accountability. \n \nB.  Develop a Stable Fiscal Source: Property Tax \n \n6.  Property tax is commonly used throughout the world due to its various advantages: (i) \nstability and predictability as a source of revenue, facilitating long-term budget planning; (ii) \nfiscal revenue resiliency during downturns due to its limited cyclicality; and (iii) transparency and \nhigh compliance rates due to difficulties in evasion. A well-functioning property tax system would \nprovide a stable basis for strengthening local fiscal capacity. International experience indicates \nthat  this  tax  would  be  a  promising  source  for  local  governments  to  meet  their  spending \nresponsibilities.  However,  the  PRC  experience  in  property  taxation  has  been  very  limited. \nExperimental schemes have been initiated since 2011 in Shanghai and Chongqing, but those \nschemes have had a limited impact.7 A critical limiting factor was the limited tax base, as most \nresidential properties were exempted. A broader tax base is necessary to take advantage of \nproperty taxation and support strengthening local fiscal capacity. \n \n7.  In addition to a tax base, key elements to design a property tax are (i) tax rate, (ii) tax \ndeduction  and  exemption  options,  (iii)  tax  administration,  and  (iv)  valuation  and  data \nrequirements. It is also important to streamline the roles of relevant governments and agencies \nin tax base and rate determinations and tax administration. An important and practical issue is \nthe  institutional  arrangement  for  assessment  of  property  value.  The  failure  to  establish  a \ncredible  valuation  system  will  erode  taxpayers\u2019  confidence,  compliance,  and  revenue \nperformance. \n \nC.  Improve Efficiency in Delivery and Financing of the Minimum Living Guarantee \nSystem \n \n8.  The  dibao  (low-income  protection)  system  in  the  PRC  provides  a  minimum  living \nguarantee for households whose average income is lower than the local standard for minimum \nsubsistence.8 Establishing the dibao system for both urban and rural residents was a significant \nachievement in the PRC to protect people from falling into poverty. Particularly, expanding the \ndibao system to include rural residents has helped reduce the gaps in economic protections \nbetween urban and rural residents.9 However, the design of the system does not adequately \ntarget those in need, and benefit levels are not necessarily in line with actual living costs. Also, \nno exit policies exist in the current design of the dibao system.10 \n \n9.  Important factors for an efficient and effective dibao system are (i) a means test, (ii) \neligibility criteria, (iii) a minimum guarantee level, and (iv) fiscal sustainability. These factors \nneed to be clearly and consistently designed to appropriately identify the target population and \n                                                \n7  Those schemes were limited in drawing up lessons for implementation of a countrywide property tax, since most \nresidential properties are exempted and tax revenue collection has been insubstantial. A property tax has been \nseen just as an economic stabilization tool rather than as a predictable and stable source for local governments. \n8  The dibao system provides income supports for eligible urban and rural residents. \n9  The dibao system was established for urban residents in 1997 and rural residents in 2007. \n10 An exit policy would motivate and support dibao beneficiaries to exit from the low-income population targeted under \nthe dibao system. \n ", "3 \n \nset benefit levels. In addition, an efficient dibao system should employ an exit policy and \ncoordinate with other social security services such as unemployment insurance. The dibao \nsystem needs to be designed not to discourage people from remaining in or returning to the \nlabor market. Another challenge in the PRC is coordination between urban and rural dibao \nsystems. Urban and rural benefit levels need to be assessed to improve their effectiveness. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC identified inclusive growth \nas one of the three pillars.11 Rapid urbanization and an aging population pose substantial \nchallenges to the government in the provision of needed public services for inclusive growth. \nEfficiency in public service procurement, delivery, and financing is a key to meet the PRC\u2019s \nexpanding needs for public services. \n \n11.  The TA will continue and complement support provided by ADB. ADB\u2019s previous support \nincluded an analysis of mechanisms to improve public service delivery, a practical guide to \nprivate sector engagement in the infrastructure sector as well as general guidance on property \ntax,12 and previous ADB TA projects supported improving regulatory frameworks, institutional \narrangements, and administration of social assistance in the PRC.13 In addition, ongoing ADB \nTA projects support building capacities of nonprofit organizations and facilitating governments\u2019 \ncontracting  with  nonprofit  organizations  for  social  service  provision  and  better  targeting  of \nbeneficiaries.14 This TA will further examine the potential of private sector engagement in public \nservice provision and will provide a detailed design of property taxation. The TA will be built on \nlessons from previous support, and will analyze the efficiency of the dibao system with particular \nattention paid to a means test, eligibility, a minimum guarantee level, fiscal sustainability, and an \nexit policy. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact will be improved efficiency in public service procurement, financing, and \ndelivery. The outcome will be improved policy and institutional frameworks for efficient public \nservice procurement, delivery, and financing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The proposed TA will deliver six major outputs in the following components: (i) efficiency \nin public service procurement, (ii) development of  a property tax, and (iii) improvement in \ndelivery and financing of the dibao system. \n \n14.  The following outputs will be delivered for efficiency in public service procurement: \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2012.

The guideline will be produced based on an analysis of international practices and \nrequirements, including technical issues and regulatory framework. It will also include a list of \npotential public services for which the private sector can be engaged and a framework to ensure \nthe quality, quantity and affordability of the public services, and will need to be adequately \nadopted in the PRC. The TA will also analyze the PRC\u2019s current preconditions for private sector \nengagement in public service provision, particularly at the local level, focusing on old-age care \nand health care services, which are in great demand. A knowledge product will be disseminated \nto officials and other relevant agencies at workshops and/or seminars. \n \n16.  The following outputs will be delivered for development of a property tax: \n(i)  Road map to develop a property tax in the PRC, including an analysis of how the \nroad map can be adequately adopted in the PRC.  \n(ii)  Capacity development for relevant officials to enhance their understanding of the \nissues related to property taxation. A knowledge product (i.e., a road map to \ndevelop a property tax in the PRC) will be disseminated to relevant officials and \nagencies of central and local governments at workshops and/or seminars. \n \n17.  The road map will include an analysis of international practice on property tax that \nfocuses on (a) tax base; (b) tax rate; (c) tax relief and mitigation options; (d) tax administration; \nand (e) alignment of governments\u2019 roles. The analysis will also cover the issues of taxation \nrelated to property acquisition, transfer, and rental, and its possible impact on the market. The \nalignment of governments\u2019 roles will cover horizontal and vertical alignments of all tiers of \ngovernments  and  relevant  agencies,  including  issues  of  legislative  and  executive  roles  in \ndecision-making and implementing processes. The TA will also analyze an appropriate path to \nexpand the tax base, as well as a valuation system, an institutional arrangement for assessing \nproperty value, and a set of requirements for assessors in the PRC, and will produce policy \nrecommendations. \n \n18.  The following outputs will be delivered for improvement in delivery and financing of the \ndibao system: \n(i)  Policy  recommendation  (a  knowledge  product)  on  improving  efficiency  and \neffectiveness of the dibao system.  \n(ii)  Capacity  development  for  relevant  officials  to  enhance  their  awareness  and \nunderstanding  of  the  reformed  design  of  the  dibao  system.  The  knowledge \nproduct will be disseminated to relevant officials at workshops and/or seminars. \n \n19.  The policy recommendation will be produced based on analyses of international practice \nand the current design and efficiency of the dibao system that focuses on (a) a means test, (b) \neligibility criteria, (c) a minimum guarantee level, (d) fiscal sustainability, and (e) an exit policy. \nThe analyses will identify major challenges in the dibao system to improve its efficiency and \neffectiveness, and examine how international practice can be adequately adopted in the PRC. \nIn addition, the TA will analyze coordination between the dibao system and social security \nservices,  such  as  unemployment  insurance,  by  focusing  on  an  incentive  mechanism  that \nmotivates beneficiaries to remain in or return to the labor market. The TA will also examine \n ", "5 \n \ncoordination  between  urban  and  rural  dibao  systems  that  highlights  administrative  and \noperational efficiency, and consistency in urban and rural benefit levels.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide $100,000 equivalent for component 1. The government will also provide counterpart \nsupport  in  the  form  of  office  space,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  services  in-kind  to  the \nconsultants, and will assist in arranging meetings with relevant agencies for all components. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from  September 2014 to  September \n2016. The International Department of the Ministry of Finance is the executing agency. The \nimplementing agencies are the Policy and Fiscal Affairs Department for component 1, the Tax \nPolicy Department for component 2, and the Social Security Department for component 3. \n22.  The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem for consultants, as well as the costs \nof workshops, seminars, study tours, and miscellaneous expenses. Disbursements under the \nTA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  implementing  agencies  will  administer  workshops, \nseminars, and a study tour of respective components, and prepare an advance payment facility \nto implement those activities. \n23.  The  TA  will  require  17.75  person-months  of  consulting  services  with  substantial \nexperience in public service procurement for component 1, 9 person-months of consulting \nservices with substantial experience in property tax for component 2, and 17 person-months of \nconsulting services with substantial minimum living guarantee system experience for component \n3. The consultants will be engaged as individual consultants by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants with deliverables linked to the design and monitoring framework are \nin Appendix 3. The consultants will maintain close  working relationship with the executing \nagency, the implementing agencies, and ADB, and will regularly discuss project progress. \n \n24.  The implementing agencies will supervise the consultants\u2019 day-to-day work and facilitate \ncommunication with relevant ministries to ensure the inclusion of wider views in the project \noutputs. ADB will assist the implementing agencies in overall TA operation and monitoring, and \ndissemination of knowledge products. Project-specific indicators and targets in the design and \nmonitoring framework will be monitored by the implementing agencies with ADB support. Policy \ndialogue will be maintained with relevant government agencies, and project-specific issues will \nbe taken up with government counterparts during review missions. Technical milestones will be \nmonitored by reports prepared by the consultants, which will be reviewed by the implementing \nagencies and ADB. TA implementation milestones will be monitored by the team leader. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.
