The  Project  will  help  recover \n  maintenance cost for the border access roads by placing appropriate \n  tolls on the upgraded roads, promote public-private partnership by \n  privatizing terminal operation of the proposed ICD at Kakarbita, and \n  enhance  governance  capacity  by  providing  facilities  of  fast  and \n  transparent customs clearance and reducing opportunities of financial \n  irregularities. The Project will lessen the vulnerability of local people to \n  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome \n  (HIV/AIDS)  and  human  trafficking  across  the  border  by  waging  a \n  participatory and awareness campaign and by providing necessary \nphysical ICD facilities in the proposed ICD with respect to preventing \nhuman trafficking.  \n \nRationale  Nepal\u2019s  landlocked  and  fragmented  terrain  substantially  hampers \ndomestic and foreign commerce. Nepal suffers from long transport \ndistances;  dependence  on  transit  routes  for  imports  and  exports; \nsubstandard  transit  logistics,  trade  facilities,  and  infrastructure; \ncumbersome  goods  clearance  procedures;  and  prolonged  clearing \ntime at the country\u2019s major gateways. Institutional capacity to manage \nan efficient transit system is weak and should be improved. \n \nThe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)-sponsored  South  Asia \nSubregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  program,  comprising \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal developed action programs for \nsubregional economic  cooperation in  six priority sectors: transport; \nenergy; tourism; environment; trade, investment, and private sector \ncooperation;  and  information  and  communication  technology.  The \nTransport Working Group (TWG) under the SASEC program identified \nsix major subregional transport  corridors, two involving Nepal, that \nneed to remove institutional and physical impediments (choke points) \nto  enhance  subregional  transport  connectivity  and  economic ", " iv   \nto  enhance  subregional  transport  connectivity  and  economic \nintegration. \n   \nGiven  the  critical  role  of  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities  in \nintegrating Nepal\u2019s economy into subregional and global markets, the \nGovernment\u2019s priority is to upgrade governance capacity and physical \ninfrastructure  to  improve  reliability  of  goods  delivery,  and  reduce \ntransport costs and goods clearing time, particularly along the corridor \nfrom Kathmandu to Kolkata and Haldia ports in India, and the corridor \nfrom  Kathmandu  to  Khulna  and  Mongla  and  Chittagong  ports  in \nBangladesh. The Transport Working Group is deliberating on broader \nissues  with  respect  to  trade  and  transit  agreements  and  customs \ncooperation  among  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  and  Nepal.  The \nproposed improvements of border transit logistics and trade facilities \nunder the Project form part of two key subregional corridors involving \nNepal, along which complementary investment initiatives are being or \nwill  be  undertaken  by  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  and  Nepal  and \nsupported by ADB. The Project is fully in line with the Government\u2019s \n10th Five-Year Plan to improve the country\u2019s subregional connectivity \nand economic integration. The Project is a result of consultation with \nsubregional  countries  and  complements  ongoing  and  prospective \nprojects along the key corridors.  \n \nObjective   The project objective is to help the Government integrate the economy \ninto  the  subregion\u2019s.  The  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ADB-\nsupported  SASEC  program  to  promote  subregional  cooperation \nthrough upgraded governance capacity, better transport facilities, and \nmore efficient and effective trade management.  \n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $26.7 million equivalent, including \ninterest charges during construction. The foreign exchange cost is \n$15.7 million, and the local currency cost is $11.0 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n_____________________________________________________ \nSource           Foreign             Local              Total             Percent \n                     Exchange        Currency           Cost    \nADB                 15.70      4.30              20.00                  75 \nGovernment       0.00                6.70                6.70                   25 \n \n     Total     15.70              11.00              26.70         100 \n ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and  The  loan  will  be  the  equivalent  in  various  currencies  of  Special \nTerms  Drawing Rights (SDR) 13,643,000 million ($20 million equivalent) from \nthe Special Funds resources of the ADB. The repayment period of the \nloan will be 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an \ninterest charge of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% thereafter.  \n ", "  v\nAllocation and  The Government will make the loan proceeds available promptly to the \nRelending Terms  Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) and will bear the \nforeign exchange risk on the loan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 1 July 2010 \nEstimated Project  31 December 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A  project  implementation  unit  will  be  set  up  under  the  Project \nArrangements  Directorate (ADB Projects) in the Department of Roads (DOR), which \n  will  be  supported  by  technical  staff  from  Department  of  Customs \n  (DOC), and Nepal Inter-modal Transport and Development Board.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  MPPW  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  DOR  the  implementing \nagency. \n   \nProcurement  All civil works contract packages will be procured in accordance with \nGuidelines for Procurement under Asian  Development Bank   loans \nfollowing international competitive bidding. International shopping will \nbe  used  for  supply  contracts  of  less  than  $500,000,  and  direct \npurchase for small or off-the-shelf items of less than $100,000.  \n   \nConsulting Services  A consulting firm will be recruited using ADB's quality- and cost-based \nselection procedure in accordance with.  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. About 37 person-months of international consultants and \n301 person-months of domestic consultants will be required to assist \nthe  Borrower  in  (i)  institutional  capacity  building  by  preparing \ndocuments and recommending equipment specifications, and training \nin automation of cargo clearance; (ii) detailed design, bid preparation, \nprocurement, construction supervision, and contract administration for \ntwo access roads and for ICDs, (iii) study and recommendation of toll \nlevels and collection methodology, and (iv) monitoring and verifying of \nresettlement action plans, environment management plans, and the \nHIV/AIDs and human-trafficking program. About 2 person-months of \ninternational individual consultants and 2 person-months of domestic \nindividual consultants will be recruited in line with  ADB's procedures \nfor recruiting individual consultants to help carry out project technical \nauditing. \n   \nProject Benefits and  As a step forward towards integrating subregional transport network, \nBeneficiaries  the Project, and similar initiatives, will provide further momentum to the \n  ongoing subregional transport cooperation, particularly deliberations \n  on institutional and legal issues involving six key corridors by making it \n  a more urgent agenda item for SASEC TWG.  \n   \n  The project benefits are not confined to Nepal. By reducing cargo \n  clearing  time,  goods  pilferage  and  damage,  and  transport  vehicle \n  operating  cost  of  exporters  and  importers  of  Bangladesh,  Bhutan, \nIndia, and others trading with Nepal will benefit from the improved ", " vi   \n  India, and others trading with Nepal will benefit from the improved \n  border facilities and accessibility. The Project will provide economic \n   benefits  to  all  SASEC  trade  communities.  The  benefits  from \n  strengthened  economic  integration,  particularly  reduced  transaction \n  costs,  will  promote  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty  in  the \n  subregion.  Relevant studies suggested that improved efficiency and \n  reduced transport costs of the six corridors might add an estimated 1% \n  to regional Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \n   \n  The economic internal rates of return are (i) 32.7% for the Bhairawa \n  access road, (ii) 18.1% for the Birganj access road, (iii) 15.2% for the \n  Kakarbita  ICD  development,  and  (iv)  47.6%  for  the  ASYCUDA \n  installation.  The  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \n  sustainable.  The  main  quantifiable  project  benefits  consist  of  (i) \nreduced vehicle operating cost; (ii) time savings from reduced travel, \ncargo handling, and customs clearance; and (iii) reduced theft and \ndamage  of  goods.  Nonquantifiable  benefits  include  increased \neconomic  integration  and  trade  competitiveness,  and  improved \ngovernance and institutional capacity. The Project will improve the \nenvironment  of  congested  areas  and  help  prevent  HIV/AIDS  and \nhuman trafficking.  \n \nThe Project will benefit truck owners, drivers, importers and exporters, \ncustoms  brokers,  passengers,  local  communities,  and  people \nemployed  in  the  trade  and  related  sectors,  where  improved \ncompetitiveness and market share will bring them tangible monetary \nbenefits.  The  institutional  capacities  of  DOC  and  DOR  will  be \nstrengthened. The Project will benefit the poor as economic growth will \nallow increased Government expenditure on poverty reduction-related \nactivities as indicated in the 10th Five-Year Plan.  \n \nRisks and  The major project risk arises from present security situation in Nepal. \nAssumptions  Therefore, the Project provides a conservative implementation period \nand  adequate  contingencies.  The  strong  political  will  of  SASEC \ncountries  will  help  smoothen  implementation  of  SASEC  transport \ncooperation  programs,  and  help  achieve  project  benefits  through \nimproved  trade  and  transit  agreements  and  enhanced  customs \ncooperation.  \n ", "76o00'E 92o00'E\nSUBREGIONAL TRANSPORT FACILITATION PROJECT\nAmritsar\nChandigarh\nAmbala N PEOPLE'SREPUBLICOFCHINA\nPatan 0 100 200 300\nBambasa Mahendranagar Dailekh Kilometers\nDELHI NEPAL Sadiya\nBikaner Pilibith Nepalganj Bijauri PokharaKATHMANDU BHUTAN Dibrugarh\nMathura Nanpara Bahraich Bhairawa Butwal Hetauda Gangtok THIMSPimHUtWokahnagdue-phodrang Itanagar\n26o00'N Agra LucknowSitapur Bansi SundauliBirganj RaPxaatulaliyaMalangwa Kakarbhitta SSehviloigkurin PChuheunkhtsaholingDewangiri Jorhat 26o00'N\nJaipur Bitanagar FBualnbgalraindha Dispur\nGopalganj\nKohima\nGwaitdor MuzaffarfurForbesganj Nilphaman\nParbatipur Shillong\nRaiganj Imphal\nVaranasi Patna IngrajBazaDrebikut Madhyapara SherpurNetrokoSnyalhet Sichar\nMymensingh\nBogra Nandail\nUdaipur Barhi Moregram RajshahiBANGBhLaluAkaDESKHishoreganj\nBiaora Bhopal RaniganIIIIj II Baharampur DaKuulsahtitaiaDHAKA JoyNdeabrapyuarngAagnajrtala Aizawal\nGandhinagar II PanaIIgIIarh Jhenaida Mirpur\nAhmedabad Ranchi II Jessore\nIIIIIIJaIIbaIIlpIIurIIIIIIII IIIIIIII TownKNhoualnpaara Barisal Feni\nINDIA Lakhnadon IIII Kolkata Mongla Chittagong\nIIII Patuakhali\nRaipur IIII Haldia MYANMAR\nII\nNagpur IIII Cox'sBazar\nII NationalCapital\nII\nDhule II II II II IIIIIIIIII IIIIII II II IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII II II Paradip CDiitvyis/TioonwanlHeadquarters\nII ProjectArea\nII Bhubaneswar\nIIIIII FeasibilityStudy(ongoing)\nII InlandClearanceDepot(ICD)\nMumbNaaisik Ramagundam IIIIIIIIII NRaatiliwonaaylRoad\nII ADB-FinancedHighway\nII\n18o00'N IIIIIIII AUDndBe-FriInmapnrcoevdemJaemntunaBridgeRailLinkProject 18o00'N\nII AccessRoadtobeConstructedorWidened\n04-asia Sholapur Hyderabad NatavalesaIIII AGDovBe-ArnsmsiesntetdofFIenadsiaib-AilistysiSstteuddyFeasibilityStudy M\n3736R 76o00'E BoundariesareInnotetrnneacteiosnsaalrBilyouanudthaorryitative. 92o00'E apv\nM 1ii", "Mv\n81o00'E 87o00'E aiii\np\nALI 2\nK\nA\nN E PA L 29o00M'NAH SETI KARNALI PEOPOLEF'SCHRIENPAUBLIC 29o00'N\nMahendranagar\nSUBREGIONAL TRANSPORT FACILITATION PROJECT BHERI DHAWALAGIRI\nRAPTI GANDAKI\nNepalganj N E P A L BAGMATI\nTansen KATHMANDU\n27o00'N BhaLiraUwaMPaBraIsNi I BirgaNnAHjReAtYaAuNdaI JANAKPUR SAGARMATHA KOSHIMEIlaC2mH7Io00'N\nINDIA Kakarbhitta\nBiratnagar\n81o00'E 87o00'E\nPokhara\nKathmandu\n110\n90\n239\nMugling\n36 223\n113\nButwal\n77\nAtaria Kohalpur Bhumahi\n47 155 236 Hetauda\nGaddachauki 19\nItahari\n15 Parasi 29\n22 303 93\nNepalganj ICD\n(12.4 km) 26\nNationalCapital\nParawanipor\nProjectArea Bhairawa (29 km) 24\nICD\nKakarbita\nExistingInlandClearanceDepot Birganj/\nProjectInlandClearanceDepot Raxaul\nBiratnagar\nProjectRoad ICD\nNationalRoadRoad\nPadam Road\nProvincialBoundary\n0\n4-ch InternationalBoundary\na\nrts Boundariesarenotnecessarilyauthoritative.\n2\n4\n7\n2\nR\nM", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Subregional Transport Facilitation Project.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Subregional economic cooperation emerged as a stepping-stone to broader regional \ncooperation in the late 1990s. The South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC)2 \nprogram identified six priority areas for economic cooperation: transport; energy; environment; \ntourism; information and communications technology; and trade, investment, and private sector \ncooperation. In February 2004, the SASEC Transport Working Group (TWG) established that \nsystem-wide impediments (choke points) to cross-border cargo movements along key transport \ncorridors in the subregion needed to be removed, such as (i) long and costly supply chains for \ninbound  and  outbound  goods;  (ii)  inadequate  infrastructure  and  cumbersome  customs \nprocedures; (iii) substandard traffic management at the borders, ineffective communications and \ncargo tracking systems, and costly  empty backhaul  practices; and (iv) lack of a risk-based \ncargo-sampling system. Transit route arrangements should be rationalized.  \n \n3.   The Islamabad Declaration adopted at the 12th Summit for South Asia Association for \nRegional Cooperation (SAARC) highlighted  the critical role of transport and transit links in \npromoting regional cooperation and economic integration. The scheduled removal of tariff and \nnontariff trade and investment barriers contained in the South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA)3 \nagreement signed at the summit is expected to open up vast opportunities for trade and \ninvestment  growth.  ADB  is  working  with  SAARC  and  SASEC  to  promote  subregional \ncooperation to upgrade the transport network and to improve policies and institutional capacity. \nSASEC countries, on their own initiative and supported by ADB, are rationalizing and simplifying \ntransit and trade agreements through SASEC and SAARC mechanisms.  \n \n4.  Nepal\u2019s landlocked and fragmented terrain substantially hampers domestic and foreign \ncommerce. Nepal suffers from long transport distances; dependence on transit routes for \nimports  and  exports;  substandard  transit  logistics  and  trade  facilities4  and  infrastructure; \ncumbersome goods clearance procedures and prolonged clearing time at the country\u2019s major \ngateways; and weak governance capacity. Nepal\u2019s major trade routes depend on access to \nIndia\u2019s transportation system, where 90% of Nepal\u2019s foreign trade transits through. The nearest \nseaport, Kolkata, India, is 1,056 kilometers (km) away. Nepalese tradeable goods thus face one \nof the highest transportation costs in the region, impeding the country\u2019s ability to make its export \ngoods  competitive  and  to  expand  foreign  trade.  With  the  elimination  of  the  Multi-Fiber \n                                                 \n1  The Project has been prepared through a regional technical assistance ADB. 2003. Subregional Transport \nFacilitation Project. Manila (RETA 6139, in the amount of $600,000, approved on 19 November 2003).  The project \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The SASEC program covers Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n3  SAFTA is expected to come into force on 1 January 2006. It is to reduce intra-regional trade tariffs by a schedule \nand degree based on the development maturity of a certain member. Member countries will eliminate nontariff and \npara-tariff measures or have them implemented in the least trade-restrictive manner to facilitate intra-SAARC trade. \nQuantitative restrictions will be eliminated subject to certain conditions. Proposals have been made with respect to \ncustoms cooperation, removal of barriers to intra-SAARC investments, etc.  \n4  Trade facilitation is often defined as \u201cthe simplification and harmonization of international trade procedures\u201d. This \ndefinition relates to a wide range of activities such as  import and export activities. The losses resulting from that \nbusiness suffer through delays at borders, complicated and unnecessary documentation requirements, and lack of \nautomation of Government-mandated trade procedures is often estimated to exceed in many cases the costs of \ntariffs. \n \n ", " 2  \nAgreement quotas by end of 2004, and the country\u2019s obligations to comply with World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) accession commitments, Nepal will have to improve its transit logistics and \ntrade facilities to provide an enabling environment for integrating itself into the  regional and \nglobal markets.  \n \n5.  A number of transit routes have been identified for the movement of third-country traffic \nfor Nepali imports and exports. The main corridors are connections through Birganj to Kolkata \nand Haldia in India by road and by rail. Another is the rail connection through Birganj and \nRaxaul to Nhava Sheva in western India, but this is not yet in full use pending an agreement \nbetween the two countries. The Government of India (GOI)  is deliberating whether to allow \nNepali transit goods, mostly from the Birganj Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) to use JNPT port in \nMumbai. There are supplementary road connections go through Biratnagar and Bhairawa to \nKolkata and Haldia. The corridors to Bangladesh are the road connections through Kakarbita to \nBanglabandha in Bangladesh, and down by road to Dhaka or Khulna and further to Mongla and \nChittagong in Bangladesh.  \n \n6.  Two out of six major subregional transport corridors, which SASEC TWG has identified \nchoke points, involve Nepal: (i) Kathmandu through the southern border of Nepal at Birganj and \nBhairawa, to Raxaul in India, and down to Kolkata and Haldia ports; and  (ii) Kathmandu-\nKakarbita-Fulbari, India; Banglabandha (Bangladesh)-Dhaka-Mongla and Chittagong ports in \nBangladesh. Given the critical role that transit logistics and trade facilities play in Nepal\u2019s \neconomic integration and development, the Government\u2019s priority is to upgrade the country\u2019s \ngovernance capacity and physical infrastructure  to improve reliability of goods delivery and \nreduce transport costs and goods clearing time, particularly along the two key subregional \ncorridors. The project component sites are integral to the subregional transport network, which, \nonce improved, will generate benefits to Nepal as well as the subregion by enhancing the \naccessibility and efficiency of goods and passenger movements in the subregion. This is \nparticularly so because these routes serve third-country trade not only outside but also within \nthe subregion. The proposed Kakarbita ICD will provide access, through India, to Bangladesh \nand Bhutan. A road section inside Nepal leading to Kakarbita will be improved under the \nongoing ADB-assisted Road Network Development Project (RNDP). The ongoing ADB-assisted \nRoad Network Improvement Project II in Bangladesh includes a border access road from Dhaka \nto  Banglabandha,  where  an  ICD  has  recently  started  to  operate.  Between  Panitanki  and \nKakarbita through Siliguri to Fulbari and Banglabandha in India, an ADB-assisted feasibility \nstudy is ongoing for strengthening Indian connections with Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. The \nroad  from  Thimphu,  Bhutan,  to  the  border  with  India  at  Phuentsholing  (connecting  to \nBangladesh and Nepal through India), where an ICD is being planned, will be improved. ADB \nprovided a TA to improve Bhutan border access roads to India. Sections of road from Raxaul to \nKolkata are being improved under the ADB-assisted West Bengal Corridor Development Project \nin India. Birganj and Bhairawa provide transit routes from Kathmandu, through Tarai in southern \nNepal, connected to national road and rail network of India to Kolkata and Haldia ports, and \npotentially to JNPT port at Mumbai on the west coast of India. This route has been identified as \none of the most important for Nepali transit goods. The GOI is studying the feasibility of \nimproving the road and rail connections and border facilities at Birganj, Bhairawa, Biratnagar, \nand Nepalganj. The GOI is also taking actions to improve the road and rail network on the India \nside of the border connecting to these points in Nepal. Once completed, the Project will improve \nthe route (i) from Kathmandu to Kakarbita and to Khulna and Mongla/Chittagong ports in \nBangladesh, or Kathmandu to Kakarbita and through West Bengal to Kolkata and Haldia ports; \nand (ii) from Kathmandu to Birganj and Bhairawa to Kolkata, Haldia, and, potentially, JNPT port \nin Mumbai. All major customs outposts in Nepal will be upgraded with a cargo clearance system \nand wide area network (WAN) system to facilitate cargo clearance. These routes and customs \noutposts serve most of the country\u2019s trade within the SASEC subregion and other countries. As \npart of SASEC initiatives and in line with the Government\u2019s 10th Five-Year Plan (2003-2007) \n ", "  3\n(Five-Year Plan), the Project is a result of intensive consultations with neighboring countries and \ncomplements the ongoing and prospective projects along the key subregional corridors, which \nADB strongly supports. \n \n7.  Nepal's  economy  is  characterized  by  a  low  and  fluctuating  growth  rate.  Following \nnegative GDP growth of 0.6% in FY2002, the economy recovered moderately and grew by 2.6% \nin FY2003,5 the lowest in the SASEC subregion. Despite the breakdown of the cease-fire in \nAugust 2003, real GDP is likely to grow by about 3.6% in FY2004, supported by agricultural \ngrowth  and  continued  improvements  in  manufacturing,  trade,  tourism,  and  overseas \nremittances.  \n \n8.  Nepal's transport infrastructure mainly consists of roads and civil aviation. Roads carry \nabout 90% of all passengers and freight within the country. A key part of Nepal's road system is \nthe 4,856 km Strategic Road Network (SRN). The national highways consist of the East-West \nHighway  (EWH)  and  north-south  highways  linking  major  towns  that  serve  much  of  the \npopulation. The EWH goes from Gaddachauki at the west border with India, to Kakarbita at the \neast border with India,  runs the length of the country in the terai, and is connected through \nnorth-south links to Kathmandu. The Tribhuvan highway is also vital, and connects Birganj at \nthe southern border with India, the country\u2019s most important trade border, where 50% of the \ncountry\u2019s trade passes through, to Kathmandu. Still, Nepal continues to lag behind its neighbors \nin road infrastructure, with an estimated road network of low density\u2014about 90 meters (m) per \nsquare km or 660 m per 1,000 people. The several sections on the present access road from \nBirganj ICD to Tribhuvan highway through Padam road are congested and encroached and \ncannot carry the heavy traffic from the Birganj ICD. A shortcut access road is proposed under \nthe Project to improve border accessibility. Cargo traffic between Kathmandu and the Bhairawa \nICD, where about 10% of the country\u2019s trade passes,  has to go north to Butwal to connect to \nEWH, 29% longer than an existing shortcut gravel road, which will be widened and upgraded \nunder the Project. \n \n9.  In  Nepal,  the  Heavy  Vehicle  Act  limits  truck  axle  loads  to  10.2  tons,  although \nenforcement is not strict. Trucks with capacity greater than 16 tons or carrying containers are \ngenerally taken no further than Birganj. Instead, the cargo is then transferred and unstuffed at \nBirganj onto 10\u201312 ton capacity Nepalese registered vehicles. About 50% of Nepal-bound \ncontainers are handled at Haldia, and 50% at Kolkata. Nepal-bound bulk cargo is  almost \nexclusively handled at Haldia, and about 90% of this is moved on to Nepal by rail, usually \nbagged.  Nepalese  vehicles  may  move  without  hindrance  to  Indian  railheads,  but  need \npermission from the Indian embassy in Kathmandu to travel further and are prohibited from \ncarrying Indian cargo. Indian trucks may enter Nepal for 72 hours but must pay fees for longer \nstays. For Nepal-Bangladesh trade, Nepali trucks need to be convoyed within India by Indian \nauthorities and stop at Fulbari (India)/Banglabandha (Bangladesh). Bangladesh vehicles cannot \nenter India. Nepal private operators dominate the road freight transport industry, mostly through \ntruckers\u2019 associations. Freight haulage rates vary by road condition. In some cases the rate per \nton-km for freight on unpaved roads is 100% higher than for paved roads.  \n  \n10.  ICDs are important for landlocked countries like Nepal wishing to improve their transport \nservices by introducing multimodal transport and containerization. ICDs have the effect of partly \nrelocating port activities from the foreign coastal transit country, and placing them under the \ncontrol  of  national  authorities,  and  creating  employment.  ICDs  need  to  be  equipped  with \nappropriate facilities to cut the land transit times considerably by reducing handling time and \nstreamlining cumbersome  procedures, resulting in decreased door-to-door transport costs and \nlessening dependence on the coastal country\u2019s ports and transport industry. \n                                                 \n5  For FY2003, GDP grew by 5.3% in Bangladesh, 6.5% in Bhutan, and 7.2% in India. \n ", " 4  \n \n11.  Nepal has one rail ICD at Birganj (38.00 hectares (ha)), and two road ICDs at Biratnagar \n(2.86 ha) and Bhairawa (3.23 ha). The two-road ICDs have been in full operation since March \n2002, run by a private operator selected through competitive bidding. The Birganj rail ICD has \nbeen in operation since July  2004. The leasing out of the two ICDs (excluding Birganj) is \nproviding the Government with NRs26.6 million (about $372,000) a year in revenues from lease \nfees. Initial benefits of the two ICDs from the improved facilities and services include reduced \ntime of truckers\u2019 entry to and exit from the terminals by up to an hour (which translates to \neconomic  savings  of  about  $500,000  per  year  in  reduced  waiting  time  in  the  terminals); \nimproved warehouse management and enhanced goods safety; easy identification and retrieval \nof stored goods, and reduced pilferage and theft.  \n \n12.  The Nepal Intermodal Transport and Development Board  (NITDB) was established in \n2001 in accordance with the Development Board Act. NITDB is chaired by the secretary of the \nMinistry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies (MOICS), and consists of members from public \nand private sector entities. NITDB\u2019s main objective is to oversee the economic and efficient \nmanagement of ICDs to facilitate Nepal\u2019s foreign trade. NITDB sources its funds from the lease \nfees, which are used to cover loan servicing of ICD construction and administrative costs.  \n \n13.  Nepal has entered transit agreements with Bangladesh and India on  various logistics \nservices,  which,  among  others,  cover  goods  storage, consolidation,  assembly,  and  import \nlicense; information requirements of the customs transit declaration; requirements for truck one-\ntime seal, and customs inspection procedure; and insurance and customs declaration agents. \nThe existing agreements are largely general and being rationalized and simplified by the \nSASEC TWG.  \n \n14.  Nepal experienced double-digit growth in exports and imports during the 1990s. The rate \nof export growth (11.4%)6 was slightly lower than the rate of import growth (14.2%).  As of \nFY2003/04, Nepal\u2019s exports increased by 6.4% and imports by 15.8%, for total trade value of \n$2,421 million and trade deficit of $1,034 million, representing a 23.1% increase over the \nprevious year. The significant widening of the trade deficit in FY2003/04 represented greater \neconomic activity in the second half of the year, which boosted total import growth. The overall \nexport-import ratios for India and third countries are 40.9% and 37.1%. The largest import \ncommodities are basic manufactures, followed by machines and transport equipment, and \nmineral fuels. Asia is the major source of Nepal imports, but much of this is entrepot trade \nmoving through Singapore and Hong Kong, China. Besides India, the largest exporters to Nepal \nare the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (13.2%) and United Arab Emirates (11.3%). \n \n15.  Nepal\u2019s main exports are a small number of products\u2014ready-made garments (23.8% of \ntotal export value) and carpets\u2014with 95% of the total exports going to North America, Europe, \nand India. The breakdown of commodities and trade suggests that the logistics for overseas \ntrade are more sensitive to time and reliability, while those for Indian and subregional trade are \nmore sensitive to cost and damage. Despite the narrow basis, trade has been a key factor \nbehind the acceleration of Nepal\u2019s economic growth in the 1990s. \n \n16.  SASEC trade accounted for 53% of total Nepal\u2019s trade in 2002/03. India is Nepal\u2019s \nlargest trading partner among SASEC countries and in 2002/03 took 93% of Nepal\u2019s exports to \nand provided 87% of Nepal\u2019s imports from SASEC countries. Between 1992/93 and 2000/03, \nNepal exports to Bangladesh grew annually by 21.4% and to Bhutan by 56.2%.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004. Asian Development Outlook 2004; ADB Key Indicators, 2004.  Manila; and Nepal Central Statistics \nBureau data. \n ", "  5\n17.  Nepal has one of the most liberalized trade policies in South Asia. The major constraints \non trade development prospects include delays in customs and transshipment, an extremely \nrigid formal labor market, inadequate infrastructure, and ineffective and unpredictable public \nsector policies.  \n  \n18.  The Department of Customs (DOC) is under the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and has 29 \ncustoms stations, most of which are on the southern border with India. DOC collects about 53% \nof the total tax revenue in Nepal, mainly comprising customs and excise duties, and value \nadded  tax,  and  largely  collected  at  the  border.  The  four  major  border  posts  for  revenue \ncollection are Birganj, Biratnagar, Bhairawa, and Kakarbita, accounting for 73% of the customs \nrevenue collected. The other significant stations are in Tribhuvan Airport, and Kodari on the \nnorthern border with the PRC. \n \n19.  The  five  major  border  crossings  into  India  are  Nepalganj,  Bhairawa,  Birganj,  and \nBiratnagar on the southern border, and Kakarbita on the eastern border. In terms of trade \nvalue,7 Birganj is the most important, accounting for about 50% each of the country\u2019s bilateral \ntrade with India and with third countries. Bhairawa is mainly for trade with India, accounting for \nabout 20% of bilateral trade. Biratnagar accounts for 16% of trade with India, and 17% with third \ncountries. Kakarbita accounts for 7% of trade with India, and 6% with third countries, mainly \nBangladesh and Bhutan. Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA) accounts for 23% of trade with \nthird countries. (sector analysis: an overview of SASEC and Nepal trade development is in \nAppendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n20.  Nepal\u2019s  import  documents  are  subject  to  Indian  inspection  by  checking  documents \nunless there is some irregularity, and by Nepalese customs, which also check the documents \nand may inspect the cargo. In most cases, clearance requires about a day on either side of the \nborder.  All  import  cargos  from  countries  other  than  India  are  emptied  for  open  customs \ninspection in Nepal.  Nepali containerized export cargo to third countries will be inspected by \nIndian  customs  if  one-time  seals  are  broken,  prolonging  clearing  time  but  also  limiting \ncontainerized  transport.  The  local  business  community  is  increasingly  demanding  that  the \nGovernment  upgrade  customs\u2019  physical  facilities  and  inspect  cargo  selectively.  Customs \noperation hours differ slightly between India and Nepal and need coordination. \n \n21.  The automated system for customs data (ASYCUDA) is a computerized cargo clearance \nsystem that speeds up clearance by using information technology and reducing and simplifying \ncustoms  documentation  and  procedures.  ASYCUDA  thus  (i)  increases  revenue  by \ncomputerizing customs tariffs, and (ii) providing reliable and timely trade and fiscal statistics. \nASYCUDA is installed in more than 70 countries. The customs broker, declaration-processing, \nselectivity, and account modules are usually introduced in the initial phase of implementation. \n \n22.  The customs declaration and accounts modules are used at TIA; Birganj, Bhairawa, and \nBiratnagar ICDs; and Kakarbita customs office. These places have no selectivity module, which, \nassisted  by  risk  management  and  post-declaration  units,  would  help  intercept  high-risk \ntransactions without excessively delaying customs clearance of low-risk goods. The customs \nbroker module needs to be installed to allow brokers to prepare and input declarations from their \noffice computer directly into the ASYCUDA in the customs office. A wide-area-network (WAN) is \nurgently  needed.  Via  existing  telephone  lines,  it  will  enable  automatic  update  of  customs \ninformation  and  operational  monitoring  and  procedural  change  to  all  connected  customs \noutposts. The procedures of the accounting  module, which enables the system to control \npayment  of  revenue  on  a  declaration  basis,  need  to  be  adjusted  to  accommodate  local \nlanguages and to capture transactions based on bank guarantees and deposits. The Project will \n                                                 \n7  Department of Customs. 2003.

The DOC post-evaluation \naudit unit, which was set up to carry out post-declaration audits at the importers\u2019 premises, will \nbe strengthened.    \n \n23.  Government Policies and Plans. The Five-Year Plan, which is a poverty reduction \nstrategy,  stresses  economic  growth,  pro-poor  development,  and  equitable  distribution  of \nincome. The Government\u2019s strategy for fostering broad-based growth hinges on a revival of \nagriculture, and a recovery in manufacturing, tourism, and exports. The Government\u2019s policy is \nto boost trade and industry, improve public resource management, and integrate Nepal into the \nregional and world economies. Domestic and international trade will be promoted, including by \n(i)  lowering  trade  transport  costs  through  development  of  ICDs  and  strategic  roads,  and \nimplementing the multimodal transport strategy; and (ii) improving customs administration. The \nFive-Year Plan recognizes the need to expand output capacity and improve the efficiency of the \nprivate sector. The Government will focus on creating a favorable environment to achieve \nprivate sector development; giving incentives to export-oriented industries and private and \nforeign investment; and reducing exporting cost, especially the trade transport costs. Steps will \nbe taken to increase the number of private sector-managed ICD terminals, expand technical \nassistance programs for export commodities, and revise existing acts and regulations to make \nthem compatible with WTO and SAFTA requirements.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Identified Choke Points \n   \n24.  The transit and trade choke points in SASEC key corridors are classified by those that \nneed to be worked out through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms and those that  can be \nacted by Nepal alone. The corridor from Katmandu to the southern border at Birganj and \nBhairawa to  Raxaul to Kolkata and Haldia ports face the following problems: (i) long road transit \nfrom Kolkata to Raxaul due to distance and poor roads, (ii) high insurance/bond costs at Kolkata \nport imposed by Kolkata Port Trust to ensure that goods will reach Nepal. As a result, additional \ncost is added to the traded goods; (iii) congestion at the border at Raxaul; (iv) the need for much \nsimpler and common forms of documentation and one-stop  inspection  at  the  Indian-Nepal \nborder, with both sides operating from the same facility; (v) the need to encourage Nepalese \ntruck owners to take their trucks to Kolkata/Haldia in India; (vi) the need to improve regulations \nfor foodstuff testing and quarantine to avoid cargo clearance delay at the borders; and (vi) the \nneed for an agreement on use of compatible electronic data interchange system between India \nand Nepal to provide data for the full use of the advanced cargo information system (ACIS). The \ncorridor from Kathmandu to Kakarbita-Fulbari-Banglabandha-Dhaka-Mongla and Chittagong \nports faces restrictive transit agreements among Bangladesh, India, and Nepal with respect to \nfree movement of goods and vehicles. In addition, Nepal needs to use the transit route to get to \nMumbai (which is closer to Europe than by Kolkata) in India. A study8 recommends solutions, \nwhich SASEC TWG is deliberating, to remove or minimize existing restrictions/impediments on \nmovement of goods and vehicles to each country to enhance economic integration in the \nsubregion.  \n \n25.  The following choke points can be addressed in Nepal alone: \n(i)  Customs procedures should be changed to remove the requirement to inspect \n100% of import and export cargo besides that from India, and to focus instead on \ntrade facilitation and selectivity analysis to identify cargo for inspection. This \nrequires a modernized cargo clearance system and supporting institutional set-\n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Subregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study. Manila. (Draft final report). \n ", "  7\nups such as intelligence units. The new procedures will not only reduce customs \nclearance time and document requirements but also minimize opportunities for \n\u201cfacilitation payments.\u201d \n(ii)  Measures should be adopted for controlled payment of revenue on a declaration \nbasis, accurate and rapid declaration processing, and easy access to updated \ncustoms information. This requires procedural adjustment to improve accounting \nmodule of ASYCUDA, currently being used in Nepal Customs.   \n(iii)  Installation of a WAN system to, among others, facilitate all customs offices \ncomplying with new policies and to expedite audit reporting. \n(iv)  Well-equipped ICDs should be provided at other major gateways, especially \nKakarbita customs area, the most important gateway at the eastern border of \nNepal, is conducted in a large customs yard, where many facilities are in a state \nof disrepair. The original surfacing has disintegrated and is deeply pot-holed, \nmaking working conditions difficult and dirty, particularly during the monsoon. \nThe  proposed  ICD  will  allow  efficient  cargo  inspection  and  assortment, and \nreduce cargo clearance time, cargo damage, and pilferage during the waiting \ntime.  \n(v)  Road from the Birganj ICD to the Tribhuvan highway should be decongested.  \nThe road from Bhairawa ICD to the EWH should be shortened in order to reduce \ntransport cost and travel time. The road from Hetauda to Kathmandu should be \nimproved. \n \n26.  The Project is expected to remove the choke points (para. 25) by (i) installing the \nselectivity, brokers, and direct trade input modules of ASYCUDA, and WAN at major customs \noffices,  including  headquarters;  (ii)  building  a  well-designed  ICD  at  Kakarbita,  the  most \nimportant trade gateway at the eastern border; (iii) improving the access roads at the most \nimportant trade gateways at the southern border; and (iv) strengthening DOC\u2019s institutional \ncapacity.  \n \n2.  Road Maintenance and Fund  \n  \n27.   The Nepal Road Board has been in operation since January 2004, with the appointment \nof  its  executive  director.  Its  funding  is  sourced  mainly  from  fuel  levies  (48.7%),  vehicle \nregistration fees (33.5%), and tolls (17.8%). These will be used to maintain all roads.9 Due to \npresent situation in the country, however, the Road Board has not been able to raise the full \namount as envisaged.  For FY2003/04, the total fund resources are NRs394 million. Of this, \nNRs200 million is allocated for SRN roads, NRs132 million for urban roads, NRs54.1 million for \ndistrict roads, and NRs7.9 million for administrative expenses. These amounts cannot even \nmeet the maintenance requirement for SRN roads. DOR has the mandate to provide for routine, \nrecurrent, emergency, and periodic maintenance for all SRN roads. Total demand in FY2003/04 \nis NRs750 million. DOR obtained NRs200 million from the Road Fund, NRs300 million from \nfiscal  budget  allocation,  and  the  rest  from  international  donors.  Underfunding  of  road \nmaintenance is expected to continue for the next 4-5 years until the fund revenue substantially \nexpands due to increased economic activities. Until then, the Government has to provide budget \nsupport for SRN and other road maintenance.  \n \n28.  The Government has given priority to routine and recurrent road maintenance of SRN \nover recent years. Three roads in Nepal are tolled. At least 70% of the tolls will be exclusively \n                                                 \n9  Types of road maintenance: (i) routine, such as cleaning drainage and cutting of grass, required continuously on \nevery road; (ii) recurrent, such as repairing potholes, grading, patching, trimming, filling, and resealing cracks, \nrequired at intervals within a fiscal year, to keep pavement in good condition; (iii) emergency, required to deal with \nemergency situations such as landslide, erosion, flood, etc.; and (iv) periodic, such as regraveling and surfacing, \nrequired every several years to rejuvenate the road pavement. \n ", " 8  \nused for routine and recurrent maintenance of tolled roads. Tolling has to be approved by the \nGovernment through the Road Board. Under the Project, the Government will include the two \nborder access roads as part of SRN, and toll the completed roads, especially since these roads \nwill be largely used by commercial vehicles. During project implementation, the toll level and \ncollection methodology will be studied. Tolls will be set at a level at least to meet periodic \nmaintenance cost.  \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n29.  Since 1972, ADB has provided seven road projects totaling $200.0 million, and TA \ntotaling $3.0 million. Following the early delays and cost overruns due mainly to inflation-related \ncost increases, ADB projects in the subsector have been generally successful.  \n \n30.  Over the last few years, ADB portfolio performance in Nepal has been affected by \npolitical, economic, and security uncertainties. The contract award ratio in Nepal is far lower \nthan the ADB average, and disbursements have fallen sharply over the past 5 years. Since the \nbreakdown of the cease-fire, there has been difficulty in fielding consultants, using explosives \nfor construction, securing government participation in field activities, and ensuring delivery of \nproject inputs. Major donors active in Nepal are improving quality-at-entry procedures to avoid \npremature entry of new projects in the portfolio. Intensive interactions with senior government \nofficials are being held quarterly to seek solutions. \n \n31.  The Project will allow advance action to recruit consultants and prepare the commercial \ncomponents of the bidding documents for civil works, with the qualification requirements. The \nissues on counterpart staff and funds are addressed in the project assurances. The project sites \nare in the  southern and eastern Nepal and may be less affected than other areas by the \ninsurgency.  Nevertheless,  a  conservative  implementation  schedule  is  made.  Active \nconsultations and public participations are promoted and will be continued, particularly with \nrespect to land acquisition, and prevention of HIV/AIDS10 and human trafficking.  \n \n32.  Early, competitive, and transparent selection of an ICD operator is necessary so that the \nnewly built ICD facilities can be used immediately and economic and financial benefits realized \nas soon as possible. The Government assures that an operator will be selected three months \nbefore completion of the Kakarbita ICD. Experiences from the previous exercise will help in \nselecting the ICD operator.  Strong political will is essential for the SASEC countries to address \nissues with respect to legal and institutional arrangements among them to maximize project \nbenefits. The SASEC TWG provides the forum for problem solving. ADB\u2019s support for SASEC \nactivities will take a consolidated approach in country assistance plans for subregional issues. \nADB\u2019s experience in regional cooperation shows that noncontroversial projects that can be \nquickly implemented should be identified. The Project is designed for concrete activities with \nsmall loan size yet with big impact on subregional cooperation. Neighboring countries have \nbeen consulted at different forums and levels.  \n  \n4.  ADB's Strategy \n \n33.  ADB is mandated by its Charter to foster economic growth and cooperation in Asia and \nthe Pacific region and to help accelerate regional economic integration and development, and \npoverty reduction. ADB\u2019s strategy for economic cooperation in South Asia will focus on support \nin three main areas: (i) policy reforms and institutional strengthening to promote cooperation in \nsome of the key sectors stated in the Islamabad Declaration, such as transportation, trade, \ninvestment and private sector development, energy and power, information communications \n                                                 \n10  human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n ", "  9\nand technology, and tourism; (ii) subregional investment projects in the key sectors; and (iii) \nbroad  cooperation  between  South  Asia  and  its  subregions,  and  other  regions.  ADB  will \nmainstream regional cooperation into country strategies and programs for the region.  \n \n34.  The  overarching  objective  of  ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  for  Nepal  is  to \nachieve sustainable reduction in poverty by fostering inclusive processes of pro-poor growth, \nsocial  development,  and  good  governance.  ADB  will  assist  in  (i)  Transport  and \nCommunications, (ii) Agriculture and Rural Development, (iii) Finance and Private Enterprise \nDevelopment,  (iv)  Energy  and  (v)  Regional  Development.  ADB  will  help  the  Government \npromote subregional connectivity and border-trade connections with neighboring countries by \ndeveloping road, airport, and telecommunication infrastructure to reduce transport costs and \ncustoms-processing delays. As security conditions permit, ADB will help revive the traditional \ntrade and transport corridors that connect Nepal to the PRC and India. \n \n5.  External Assistance to the Sector \n \n35.  ADB has provided much technical and financial support to improve transit logistics and \ntrade facilities in the SASEC subregion. The World Bank loaned $23.5 million to Nepal to help \nbuild an ICD at Birganj, renovate  two ICDs at Biratnagar and Bhairawa, install ASYCUDA \naccounting  and  declaration  modules  and  the  ACIS,  and  introduce  institutional  and  legal \nchanges. ADB is preparing further assistance to SAARC for transport connectivity in South Asia.  \nThe external assistance to road and multimodal transport sector is in Appendix 3. \n \n36.  The GOI is studying the feasibility of improving road/rail connections with Nepal.  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) is working on the last section from Banepa to Sindhuli, \nwhich, once completed, will shorten the road from Kakarbita to Kathmandu by 140 km. The PRC \nis helping Nepal upgrade the Syaphrubesi-Rasuwagadhi road connecting to the PRC border, \nand has proposed to provide a container scanner at Birganj ICD to strengthen security.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective  \n \n37.  The Project\u2019s objective is to help integrate Nepal\u2019s economy into the subregions and the \nworld. The Project is part of ADB\u2019s SASEC program to support subregional cooperation by \nupgrading governance capacity, improving transport facilities, and making trade management \nmore efficient and effective.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n    \n1.  ICD Access Road Component \n \n38.  The Project will finance (i) upgrading/construction of a two-lane access road with 7 m \nwide carriageway with up to 50 m right of way of Birganj ICD (Padam road) to Tribhuvan \nHighway (about 12.4 km), to enable trucks and buses to avoid the congested Birganj and Jitpur \nmarket area on the Tribhuvan highway leading to Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal; and (ii) \nupgrading of a shortcut gravel road at Bhairawa to a two-lane access road with 7 m wide \ncarriageway and 18 m corridor of influence, to shorten the route from Bhairawa to the EWH at \nBhumahi leading to Kathmandu and other parts of Nepal (about 29 km).  \n \n ", " 10  \n2.  ICD Component \n \n39.  The Project will finance construction of a 7.5 ha road ICD at Kakarbita at the eastern \nborder,  with  all  necessary  facilities  such  as  fence,  lighting,  cover  shed,  weighbridge, \nadministration  buildings,  and  container  platform.  A  separate  immigration  office  and  other \nfacilities will be provided which will also help efforts being undertaken in the country to prevent \nhuman trafficking. Built-in security measures are designed to include proper fencing and guard \nposts. ICD security measures will be further examined in line with the country\u2019s regulations and \nbusiness practices, and security requirements of international best practice and destination \nports.  \n \n3.  Automation System of Customs Cargo Clearance and Management  \n \n40.  The Project will finance (i) installation of the ASYCUDA selectivity, and broker\u2019s direct \ntrade input modules at the customs offices at Kakarbita, Krisnagar, Tatopani,  TIA, Birganj, \nBhairawa, Biratnagar, and Birganj ICD; and (ii) equipment purchase and installation of  WAN at \nthe above customs offices, plus Nepalganj and Mahendranagar, linked with a central control \nroom in customs headquarters via existing telephone lines, covering 98.4% of Nepal\u2019s total \ntrade value.  \n \n4.  Institutional Capacity Building \n \n41.     The Project will provide training of trainers and end users of customs facilities for (i) \noperation,  maintenance,  and  procedural  adjustment  of  ASYCUDA  modules  and  the  WAN \nsystem; (ii) setting up of an intelligence unit and risk management system; (iii) assisting in \npreparation of instruction manuals of the intelligence unit, and training of customs officers in \nintelligence gathering, analysis, and related techniques; and (iv) post-declaration evaluation and \ncustoms valuation of harmonized customs duties.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Promoting Subregional Cooperation and Governance Capacity \n \n42.  Nepal  actively  promotes  subregional  cooperation  and  economic  integration.  The \nGovernment plans to (i) complete the computer-based customs facilitation systems and cargo-\ntracking systems, (ii) continue efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the DOC \nand the transparency in collection of customs revenues, (iii) establish effective procedures to \nclear sealed containers, allowing them to travel to and from Kathmandu, (iv) establish the \ncarriage of goods by road, railway, and multi-modal transport acts, (v) reform and update \nNepal's insurance laws for the carriage of goods by road and maritime transport, (v) strengthen \nthe freight-forwarding industry, and (vi) provide well-equipped ICDs and construct better access \nroads for trade transport. The Government is working bilaterally and multilaterally to improve \ninstitutional,  policy,  and  legal  arrangements  through  SASEC  and  SAARC.  Under  the \nGovernment\u2019s Three-Year Customs Reform and Modernization Action Plan, the Government \nhas shown strong commitment to modernize customs along the line of (i) simple and modern \nprocedures; (ii) effective post-release review of customs declarations; (iii) use of information \ntechnology; (iv) introduction of effective forms of organization and management with clear \nobjectives,  strategic  and  operational  plans,  performance  criteria,  and  management  and \nstrategies for integrity; and (v) orientation of the institution toward service. As part of overall \ncustoms reform program aided by United Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), \nInternational  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO),  World  Customs \nOrganization (WCO), and World Bank, ASYCUDA/WAN installation and capacity building are \nexpected to (i) expedite customs clearance; (ii) reduce opportunity for unintended payment for \n ", "  11\ncargo inspection; (iii) increase Government fiscal revenue from customs duties, (iv) improve \nservices, and (v) strengthen capacity for sustaining the reform process.  \n   \n2.  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) \n \n43.  The Five-Year Plan recognizes that private sector participation in public infrastructure \nareas will be gradual. PPP is necessary to promote private sector development at this stage. \nThe  Government  will  continue  to  promote  private  sector  development  and  attract  foreign \ninvestment.  The  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  new  ICD  will  be  privatized  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding  and  a  transparent  process  after  completion,  when  the \ninvestment risk is reduced. This is the best practical approach as demonstrated by the recent \nsimilar project in the country, particularly given the present political and security situation.  \n \n  3.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking  \n \n44.  The Project recognizes the importance of preventing HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, \nwhich is in line with Five-Year Plan. Separate immigration office and facilities will be provided in \nthe  Kakarbita  ICD  to  facilitate identification of illegal immigrants. In the project area, local \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), international donor agencies, and the Government are \nalready carrying out HIV/AIDs awareness campaigns and anti-trafficking programs. With the \nDepartment of Health and other local agencies, the Project will carry out similar activities among \nconstruction workers and high-risk communities along the highway, border police, and customs \nofficers,  using  the  media,  and  information,  education,  and  communications  materials \n(Supplementary Appendix B).  \n \n4.  Road Safety and Axle-Load Control \n \n45.  The increase in vehicle density, together with lack of road safety measures and poor \nenforcement and roadworthiness of vehicles, has led to serious problems. In 2003, Nepal \nexperienced 43 deaths per 10,000 vehicles, which is high. The Traffic Engineering and Safety \nUnit of DOR is responsible for road safety, collects traffic accident data, and conducts safety \naudits for all SRN roads. To improve and expand existing road safety programs, a road safety \ncommittee has been set up and chaired by the minister for transport management. Successful \nmanagement of heavy vehicle loads will result in more economical road designs and reduced \nroad maintenance and rehabilitation costs. The Ministry of Public Planning and Works (MPPW) \nhas, in accordance with the Vehicle and Transport Management Act and Public Roads Act, set \na maximum legal limit of 10.2 tons per axle for all vehicles. A pragmatic and enforceable heavy-\nvehicle management policy is being drafted and expected to be approved by MPPW by the end \nof 2004. \n \n46.  The new aligned sections of the two access roads under the Project will meet the road \nsafety standards on road geometry, intersections, and side drains. On the exiting alignment, \naccident-prone places or black spots will be identified and improved. Safety audit will be \nconducted during and immediately after detailed design is completed and before going to \ntender. For both roads, road painting and road signs will be provided to reduce accidents. The \nproject  design  will  incorporate  bus  stands;  separate  lanes  for  bullock  carts,  cycles,  and \nrickshaws; and pedestrian facilities. The training and public awareness campaign on road safety \nunder the RNDP will be extended to this Project. The Government will use the weighbridges in \nthe Birganj, Bhairawa, and Kakarbita ICDs to control overloading.  \n \n \n \n \n ", " 12  \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n47.  The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $26.7  million  equivalent  (Table  1).  Foreign \nexchange costs are estimated at $15.7 million, representing 59% of the total project cost. The \nlocal currency cost is estimated at $11 million.

The proposed ADB loan is $20 million equivalent from \nits Special Funds resources to finance 100% of the foreign exchange costs and 39% of the local \ncurrency costs. ADB financing represents 75% of the total project cost. Local cost financing is \nnecessary in view of the high percentage of local currency expenditures and the Government's \nfiscal constraints. The loan is financed by subregional cooperation indicative planning figure to \nimprove the border  accessibility, which generates subregional benefits. The Government will \nfinance 25% of the total project cost, including taxes and duties and cost for land acquisition and \nresettlement. \n \nTable 2:  Indicative Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency \n      ADB  15.70    4.30    20.00    75   \nGovernment  0.00  6.70  6.70  25 \n \nTotal  15.70    11.00    26.70    100   \n       ADB = Asian Development Bank. \n       Source: ADB estimates. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  13\nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Executing and Implementing Agencies \n \n49.  MPPW will be the Executing Agency (EA), and DOR the Implementing Agency (IA). Both \nhave long experience in implementing ADB-financed road projects. The ADB project directorate, \nestablished in 1987, and fully functional under previous projects, will be maintained within DOR \nand serve as the project implementation unit (PIU) for overall project coordination, monitoring, \nand implementation. The  PIU will include technical staff from DOR and NITDB to provide \ntechnical support for cargo clearance automation, institutional strengthening, and ICD design \nand construction. This type of arrangement has proven to be effective under a recent similar \nproject. In line with the Government\u2019s Civil Service Act & Regulation,  DOR will maintain the \nappointed full-time project director for at least the initial two years of project implementation, \nsubject to satisfactory performance, and promptly inform ADB of any change of the project \ndirector. DOR will ensure that the person appointed will (i) be a senior officer with adequate \ntechnical and administration experience and qualifications, and (ii) be assisted by appropriate \nand adequate technical, financial, and administrative staff. One project office in Kathmandu and \nthree field project offices will be set up to be responsible for day-to-day implementation, and \nreport to the project director in the PIU. \n \n50.  A project steering committee,  chaired by the secretary of MPPW,  will be set up to \noversee project implementation. The committee will comprise senior officials of MPPW/DOR, \nNational Planning Commission (NPC), MOF, MOICS, DOC, Federation of Nepalese Chambers \nof Commerce and Industry (FNCCI), and Nepal Freight Forwarders Association (NFFA). Other \nstakeholders representing the end users may be invited to give advice. The steering committee \nwill meet at least twice a year to review project implementation, and may meet whenever \nnecessary. \n \n51.  The  PIU  project  director  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  all  aspects  of  project \nimplementation  and  management,  including  procurement,  progress  monitoring,  financial \nmanagement, reporting, land acquisition and resettlement, and HIV/AIDs and human-trafficking \nprevention programs. The project director will act as project coordinator among concerned \nGovernment agencies. The project implementation organization chart is in Appendix 5. \n   \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n52.  The Project will be implemented over five years, inclusive of preconstruction and a 12-\nmonth defect liability period, and is expected to be completed by December 2009. The civil \nworks will commence around May 2006. This schedule is dependent on, among others, (i) \nconsultants being engaged by the end of May 2005; and (ii) land being made available, free \nfrom  any  encumbrances,  within  about  20  months  after  the  Project  starts,  and  before \nconstruction. The summary implementation schedule is in Appendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement  \n \n53.  The  project  director,  supported  by  an  adequate  number  of  staff  members  and \nconsultants with the appropriate mix of technical and contract management skills, will be \nresponsible for all procurement. ADB will supervise procurement by closely monitoring all major \nproject implementation activities. Three civil works contracts for access roads and one contract \nfor ICD construction will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Local \ncontractors are expected to participate in bidding. One supply contract for WAN equipment and \nservices will be awarded on the basis of international shopping. A summary of indicative project \nprocurement packages is in Appendix 7 and Supplementary Appendix C. All contracts will be \n ", " 14  \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement.  ADB's standard bidding \ndocuments for international competitive bidding will be used. However, because the contracts \nare small, qualification requirements will be included in the bidding documents for evaluation \nwhen bids are received. Equipment for international shopping will be accepted for supply \ncontracts of less than $500,000, and direct purchase will be applied for small or off-the-shelf \nitems of less than $100,000.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n54.  Consulting  services,  international  and  domestic,  will  be  required  to  help  the  EA \nimplement  the  Project.  A  firm  of  international  consultants  (Consultant)  in  association  with \ndomestic  consultants  will  help  in  (i)  institutional  capacity  building,  including  document \npreparation and specification recommendation for equipment, and training for the ASYCUDA \ncomponent;  (ii)  detailed  design,  procurement,  and  construction  supervision  and  contract \nadministration for access roads and ICD, (iii) study and recommendation of toll levels and \ncollection  methodology,  and  (iv)  monitoring  and  verifying  of  resettlement  action  plans, \nenvironment management plans, and the HIV/AIDs and human-trafficking prevention program. \nAbout  37  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  301  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants will be required. About 2 person-months of international individual consultants and 2 \nperson-months  of  domestic  individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  by  MPPW  on  the \nrecommendation  of  National  Vigilance  Center  (NVC),  in  line  with  ADB's  procedures  and \napproved terms of reference (TORs)  to help the EA carry out project technical auditing. Draft \nTORs for the international consulting firm are in Appendix 8, and that for individual consultants \nin Supplementary Appendix D. The international consulting firm will be selected and engaged \nusing ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures for recruiting firms under full technical \nproposals (FTP) in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. All individual \nconsultants will be selected and engaged in line with ADB's procedures for recruiting individual \nconsultants. \n \n5.  Advance Action  \n \n55.  To  ensure  project  implementation  readiness,  advance  action  is  approved  for \nprocurement  and  recruitment  to  expedite  selection  of  consultants  and  preparation of the \ncommercial  components  of  the  bidding  documents  for  civil  works,  with  the  qualification \nrequirements. The Government has been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project.  \n \n6.  Disbursement \n \n56.  An  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,  replenished,  and  liquidated  in \naccordance with ADB's  Loan Disbursement Handbook  as amended from time to time, and \ndetailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited in \nthe imprest account will be based on the estimated expenditures for six months or 10% of the \nloan  amount, whichever is lower.  The account will be established with Nepal Rastra  Bank.   To  \nexpedite  disbursement  during  implementation,  statement  of   expenditures   will  be  used   to  \nreimburse or liquidate the imprest advance for any individual payment not exceeding $100,000.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  15\n7.  Reports, Accounts, and Audits \n \na.  Reports \n \n57.  The Consultant will submit monthly progress reports to DOR, MPPW, MOICS, NITDB, \nDOC, and ADB. DOR will ensure that the Consultant include in the reports the status of land \nacquisition, resettlement, environmental management, training, prevention of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking, and other activities critical to project implementation but not directly included \nin the scope of engineering services. Within three months of physical completion, DOR will \nsubmit a project completion report in a format acceptable to ADB. DOR will monitor project \npreparation and implementation in accordance with the implementation schedule, and keep \nADB informed of any significant deviations that could result in the schedule not being met. \n \n    b.  Accounts and Audits \n \n58.   A financial management assessment of DOR and NITDB has been carried out. DOR \nwill maintain separate project records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and services \nfinanced from the loan proceeds, financing resources received, project expenditures, and use of \nlocal  funds.  The  accounts  for  all  project  expenditures  will  be  set  up  in  accordance  with \nconsistent and sound accounting principles and in line with the law. An independent auditor \nsatisfactory to ADB will audit consolidated project accounts and related financial statements \nannually. Due to the diversity of the project components and sites, and procedures involved \namong MPPW, MOF, and the auditor general\u2019s office, unaudited and audited project accounts \nand financial statements will be submitted to ADB within six and nine months, respectively, after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The audit requirements should include an audit \nwith separate opinion on the use of imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Technical Auditing \n \n59.  Assisted by the Consultant, DOR will develop a baseline for performance monitoring and \nevaluation in accordance with ADB's Project Performance Management System Handbook, and \nestablish  systematic  project  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation  (PPME), including of \nbenefits. Surveys will be conducted before institutional training, installation of ASYCUDA/WAN, \nand  civil  works  construction;  every  year  during  the  Project;  and  one  year  after  project \ncompletion.  The  findings  and  supporting  data  will  be  indicated in project implementation \nprogress  reports,  and  incorporated  into  the  project  completion  report.  The  data  on \nimplementation will help in project monitoring as well as in early identification of potential \nproblems.  The  performance  indicators  will  be  based  on  the  project  logical  framework  to \ndetermine if development objectives have been attained. Before the project midterm review \n(MTR),  DOR,  assisted  by  individual  consultants  appointed  by  MPPW  from  among  NVC\u2019s \nnominees,  will  carry  out  project  technical  auditing  of  project  procurement,  contract \nadministration, and quality inspection, in cooperation with NVC. The consultants\u2019 final report will \nbe submitted to ADB, and to NVC through MPPW. NVC will provide counterpart staff to help the \nconsultants carry out the technical auditing.  \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n60.  In addition to regular reviews by ADB staff, a detailed MTR by the Government and ADB \nis required to assess the Project\u2019s progress and to agree upon any changes to scope or \nimplementation arrangements. The MTR will be conducted by the end of second year of \nimplementation. Two months before the MTR, the EA will submit to ADB a detailed status report \non project implementation. The TORs of the MTR will be included in the project administration \nmemorandum to be prepared by ADB\u2019s inception mission.  \n ", " 16  \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Policy and Institutional Impacts  \n \n61.  As  a  step  forward  towards  integrating  subregional  transport  network,  the  Project, \ntogether with similar initiatives, will provide further momentum to the ongoing subregional \ntransport cooperation, particularly the ongoing deliberations of institutional and legal issues \ninvolving the six key corridors, by making it a more urgent agenda item for the SASEC TWG.  \n \n62.  The Project will facilitate DOC\u2019s institutional strengthening to harmonize and simplify \ncustoms  clearance  procedures  and  increase  its  transparency.  This  and  project  technical \nauditing will reduce opportunities of financial irregularities and strengthen NVC\u2019s capacity in \nroad sector technical auditing through hands-on experience. \n \n63.  DOC will seek to harmonize border operation hours with neighboring countries to allow \nmaximum clearance of cargo movement at major gateways. Privatization of operation and \nmaintenance of the proposed ICD at Kakarbita will help develop the private sector and enhance \noperation the ICD\u2019s efficiency. The tolling of border access roads will strengthen the Road \nBoard\u2019s  maintenance  capacity.  These  measures  will  improve  transit  transport  and  trade \nfacilities,  and  thus  contribute  to  economic  growth,  reduce  poverty,  and  provide  scope  for \nincreased private sector participation.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Benefits  \n \n64.  The economic and the financial analyses are respectively in Appendixes 9 and 10 and in \nSupplementary  Appendixes  E  and  F.  The  major  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  are \nincremental, resulting from reduced VOC, value of time saved, reduced capital required for \ncargo owners, and reduced loss from goods damage.  \n \n65.  Nonquantifiable benefits include increased competitiveness for exporters and increased \nmarket shares; improved productivity of customs officers; reduced environmental impact; and \nincreased public awareness of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, particularly among Government \nofficials, including customs officers. \n \n66.  The project benefits are not confined to Nepal. By reducing cargo-clearing time, goods \npilferage  and  damage,  and  transport  vehicle  operating  cost,  exporters  and  importers  of \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and others trading with Nepal will benefit from the improved border \nfacilities and accessibility. The Project will provide subregional economic benefits to all SASEC \ntrade communities. The benefits of economic integration, particularly reduced transaction costs, \nwill help promote economic growth and reduce poverty in the subregion.11  \n \n67.  The base case EIRRs are 32.7% for the Bhairawa access road, 18.1% for the Birganj \naccess road, 15.2% for the Kakarbita ICD, and 47.6% for ASYCUDA installation.  \n \n68.  The sensitivity of the overall project EIRR was analyzed with respect to changes in the \ncost-and-benefit  streams.  Seven  sensitivity  tests  were  conducted:  (i)  construction  costs \nincreased by 25%, (ii) construction period extended by 2 years, (iii) no generated traffic, (iv) no \ntime savings, (v) traffic growth rates reduced by 25%, (vi) total benefits reduced by 25%, and \n(vii) a combination of (i) and (vi). The results show that the quantified economic benefits are \nrobust. The EIRR falls below 12% only for two cases in the Kakarbita subcomponent, where \n                                                 \n11  If efficiency and transport costs of the six corridors were improved or reduced as recommended, regional GDP \nmight increase by 1% (footnote 8). \n ", "  17\ntotal benefits are reduced by 25% and where benefits are reduced as costs increase. Though \nthe EIRR is less than 12% in these cases, it is not far below the threshold, and the probability of \nit occurring is small, especially for the case where construction costs increase by 25% and total \nbenefits decrease by 25%. The EIRRs are based on conservative estimates of traffic growth, \nconsidering risks of impassability due to political and natural causes. Savings from accident \nreduction are not considered. \n \n69.  The financial evaluation for the Kakarbita ICD used real terms in constant 2004 prices. \nThe project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real \nterms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation.  The  after-tax  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  is  9.8%,  which  compares \nfavorably with the after-tax weighted average cost of capital of 1.3%. The Project is considered \nfinancially viable and sustainable. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for the \nKakarbita ICD is robust under most conditions.  \n \n70.  The Project includes placing tolls on the two border roads. While the details of the toll-\nsetting  mechanism  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  preliminary  financial \nanalysis has been undertaken. Traffic forecasts and maintenance costs have been calculated \nand projected for the two roads. The toll rate is assumed to be similar to that applied on similar \nroads in Nepal (NRs0.36/km), and appears to generate sufficient revenue to cover maintenance \ncosts, including periodic maintenance. The actual toll level and collection methodology will be \nformulated during project implementation to recover maintenance costs at periodic level or \nhigher without deviating from the project objective.  \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n \n71.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project was developed to minimize the need \nfor land acquisition and resettlement. A full census has been undertaken for all affected persons \n(AP),  and  for  land,  structure,  and  assets  along  the  right  of  way  for  ICD  development  in \nKakarbita; for upgrading of two access roads to two-lane, 7 m carriageway from Bhairawa ICD \nto Bhumahi at EWH and Birganj ICD to Tribhuvan highway; and for widening of roads at \nJeetpur. The Project will require acquisition of about 81 ha of private land to widen and improve \naccess roads. Construction of the Kakarbita ICD will not require any land acquisition since \nadequate Government land (7.5 ha) is available. Acquisition of agricultural land will affect 2,412 \nhouseholds; 129 households will lose their residences, some of which are used for commercial \npurposes, along with six community structures. Overall the Project will affect 2,881 households \n(23,125 APs); 334 people will temporarily lose their income. Compensation for land acquisition \nand involuntary resettlement will be paid as per ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy and \nADB's Handbook on Resettlement 1998, as amended from time to time, which will be provided \nfor loss of livelihood, shifting of structures/ goods, income restoration, economic rehabilitation, \nand lost community assets. No indigenous people will be harmed by the Project. The estimated \ncost for land acquisition and resettlement is about $4.8 million. The full resettlement plan has \nbeen translated into Nepali and disclosed to the APs, and will be publicly available at MPPW, \nDOR, ADB Nepal Resident Mission, and the ADB Web site. A summary resettlement plan is in \nSupplementary Appendix G. \n \n72.  Poverty Reduction. The Project will benefit Nepali truck owners, drivers, importers and \nexporters, customs brokers, passengers, local communities, and people in the trade and related \nsectors, where improved competitiveness and market share will increase their incomes. The \nProject will benefit the poor as strengthened fiscal expenditure due to economic growth will \nincrease  Government  expenditure  on  health,  education,  water  supply,  sanitation,  rural \nelectrification, and other basic services, as indicated in the Five-Year Plan. Local rural labor will \n ", " 18  \nbenefit from road construction jobs during project implementation (Appendix 11, Summary \nPoverty Reduction and Social Strategy). \n \nD.  Environment Impacts \n \n73.  As  the  Project  is  categorized  as  \u201cB\u201d  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines 2003, an initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared. \n74.  For the road project component, the environmental impacts associated with construction \nwill include (i) disruption of traffic in the construction area, (ii) increased air pollution due to \nincreasing dust and other volatile chemical substances from the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and \nvibration,  (iv)  disruption  of  water  systems  due  to  filling  to  increase  embankment  and \nconstruction of bridges and culverts, and (v) disruption due to establishment of the temporary \naccess  road.  These  impacts  will  occur  only  during  construction  and  can  be  mitigated  by \nmeasures in the civil works contract. During operation, traffic congestion will be reduced, \nimproving air quality due to reduced air pollution associated with inefficient car combustion. \n \n75.  The environmental impact of building the Kakarbita ICD will be limited to the ICD area, \nand mainly due to increased traffic to transport construction materials and equipment, and dust \nand noise from construction and demolition. The impact during operation will be mainly from the \nincreased  number  of  slow-moving  vehicles  and  increased  air  pollution  due  to  low  engine \ncombustion. Drainage wastewater needs to be properly treated before disposal into public water \nbodies such as streams, rivers, or irrigation canals. The ICD will need simple solid waste \nmanagement. The sub-power station should use only transformers free of PCBs.  \n \n76.  The summary IEE (Appendix 12) shows that environmental impacts associated with the \nProject are insignificant and can be mitigated. No environmentally sensitive areas will be \ndisrupted. A full environmental impact assessment (EIA) to assess the project impacts is not \nrequired.  \n \nE.  Project Risks \n \n77.  The Project has been carefully formulated to manage and mitigate risks. Advance action \nwill help expedite consultant recruitment and procurement. The PIU will be appropriately staffed. \nNGOs will be selected and engaged to help implement the land acquisition and resettlement \nplan. The Consultant will help procure land and monitor project implementation. ADB will \nrigorously monitor project implementation and technical auditing throughout the project period \nthrough  intensive  interactions  with  the  Government,  EA,  and  other  donors.  The  risk  of \ninadequate counterpart funding has been addressed by gaining Government commitment to \ninclude the Project in the Government\u2019s core projects starting in FY2005/06, to ensure that the \nbudget allocations for the Project will be protected, particularly the cost of land acquisition and \nresettlement.  \n \n78.  Escalation  of  the  conflict  since  2001  presents  serious  difficulties  in  project \nimplementation and constitutes a major project risk. Therefore, the Project has been in full \nconsultation with local communities and provides a conservative implementation period and \nadequate contingencies.  \n \n79.  The project benefits will be better achieved if SASEC transport programs proceed \nsmoothly. The strong political will of SASEC countries, particularly demonstrated by the SAARC \nIslamabad Declaration, provides much-needed political support for project implementation.  \n \n \n \n ", "  19\nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n80.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nprovisions, which have been incorporated into the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Land acquisition and resettlement.

The Government will ensure timely and adequate provision \nof counterpart funds for the Project. \n(vi)  Axle-load control. The Government will use weighing bridges at the Birganj, \nBhairawa, and Kakarbita ICDs to measure overloading, and enforce compliance, \nincluding  by  penalizing  violators  in  accordance  with  Vehicle  and  Transport \nManagement Act and Public Roads Act. DOR will provide an annual report to \nADB  on  the  status  of  load  enforcement  measures,  incidence  of  vehicle \noverloading, and other benchmarks that are consistent with the policy. \n(vii)  Customs operation. The Government will synchronize border operation hours \nwith  neighboring  countries  to  facilitate  cross-border  vehicle  movement.  The \nGovernment will adopt flexible operation hours to accommodate inspection of \nlate cargo.  \n ", " 20  \n(viii)  Anticorruption measures. The Government acknowledges that ADB, consistent \nwith  its  commitment  to  good  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency, \nreserves the right to undertake directly or through its agents, investigation of any \npossible financial or managerial impropriety in the conduct of the Project. The \nGovernment  and  its  relevant  agencies  will  fully  cooperate  with  any  such \ninvestigation  and  extend  all  necessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all \nrelevant books and records as well as engagement by MPPW and DOR of \nindependent experts who may be needed for satisfactory completion of such \ninvestigations. All costs related to such investigation will be borne by the Project.  \n(ix)  Project  technical  audit.

", "        Appendix 2    23 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nOVERVIEW OF SOUTH ASIA AND SUBREGIONAL ECONOMIC COOPERATION \nPROGRAM AND NEPAL TRADE DEVELOPMENT \n \n \nA.  SASEC Program \n \n1.  In 1997, four countries of the seven members of the South Asia Association for Regional \nCooperation  (SAARC):1  Bhutan,  Bangladesh,  India  and  Nepal  requested  ADB  to  facilitate \ninitiatives to accelerate sustainable economic development among the group of four. As a \nresponse, South Asia Sub-regional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program commenced in \n2001.  A  steering  committee  comprising  secretaries  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  of  each \nparticipating country was established to provide overall guidance and support for activities under \nthe  SASEC  program.  The  steering  committee  has  identified  6  priority  areas  for  economic \ncooperation:  transport;  energy;  environment;  tourism;  Information  and  Communications \nTechnology; and trade, investment and private sector cooperation. The Transport Working \nGroup (TWG) was set up in October 2001. At the recommendation of TWG, studies were \ncarried out to identify system-wide impediments to smoother cross border movement of cargoes \nin the SASEC sub-region. At the TWG meeting in Bangkok in February 2004, it was established \nthat certain choke points along key sub-regional transport corridors in the sub-region would \nneed to be removed.  Among others, these are long and costly suppliy chains for both inbound \nand outbound goods, inadequate infrastructure and cumbersome customs procedures, sub- \nstandard traffic management at the borders, ineffective communications and cargo tracking \nsystems, costly empty backhauls, lack of a risk-based cargo sampling system, and present \ntransit route arrangements need further rationalization. \n \n2.  ADB has been active in promoting subregional cooperation in South Asia.  Under the \nSASEC framework, or under the individual country programs, several projects of significant sub-\nregional  implication  have  been  identified,  and  currently  under  implementation  or  being \nconsidered. Among these projects, the following five projects are of particular relevance to the \nproposed Transport Facilitation Project in Nepal.  \n \n(i)  Bangladesh: Road Network Improvement & Maintenance II Project ($124 million \nloan), one component of which is the improvement of a boarder access road to \nBanglabandh (57km), a border point leading to Kakarbita/Nepal via Siliguri/India.  \n(ii)  Bangladesh: Proposed Chittaqong Port Trade Facilitation Project ($20 million loan). \nThe  possible  components  include:  (i)  development  of  a  link  road  to  container \nterminals extended from the envisaged port access road; (ii) computerization of \ncontainer terminal operation and enhanced link with customs computer systems; and \n(iii) customs component.  \n(iii)  India:  Subregional  Transport  Connectivity  Project  including  the  improvement  of \nKakarbita - Siliguri - Fulbari, a link connecting Nepal to Bangladesh.   \n(iv)  India: land waterway sector I Project ($150 million loan) which will improve three \ninland  waterways,  including  the  waterway  connecting  Guhawati/Assam  to \nBangladesh border along Bhramaputra River. \n                                                 \n1 SAARC, established in 1985 was the first regional cooperation initiative to promote collaboration and mutual \nassistance in the economic, social, cultural, technical and scientific fields, and to strengthen cooperation among the \nmember states in international for a on matters of common interest. It comprises seven regional countries, i.e., \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. ", "22 4           Appendix 2     \n(v)  Bhutan: Industrial Estate and Inland Clearance Depot Development Project. One of \nthe two components is the development of an ICD at Phuntsoling, which would be \nconnected to Kolkata/Haldia via Siliguri.   \n \n3.  The benefits of the proposed transport facilitation Project are a natural extension of \nADB\u2019s efforts under SASEC and will complement the benefits of the above projects and assist \nthe subregional countries to reap the potential of economic growth by way of strengthened \nsubregional economic cooperation.  \n \nB.  Nepal Trade and Related Issues \n  \n4.  Nepal\u2019s economy is highly reliant on foreign trade2. Nepalese trade experienced double-\ndigit growth in both exports and imports during the 1990s. The rate of export growth (11.4 %)3 \nwas  slightly  lower  than  the  rate  of  import  growth  (14.2%).  In  FY2003/04,  Nepal\u2019s  exports \nincreased by 6.4%, imports increased by 15.5% with a total trade value of NRs174, 283 million \n($2,421 million) and the trade deficit reached NRs74, 422 million ($1,034 million), representing a \n23.1%  increase  over  the  previous  year.  The  significant  widening  of  the  trade  deficit  in \nFY2003/04 stemmed from greater economic activity in the second half of the year, which \nboosted growth in total imports. Nepal\u2019s largest export commodity is garments ($165.1 million, \n23.8% of its total export value), followed by carpets ($73.9 million) and Jute goods ($26.4 \nmillion). Correspondingly, the largest import commodity is basic manufactures ($484.6 million), \nfollowed by machines and transport equipment ($287.5 million) and mineral fuels ($277 million).  \n \n5.  India remains the single largest trading partner of Nepal. In FY2002/03, nearly 48% of \nNepalese exports were destined for India, while nearly 22% of all imports originated from India. \nNepal\u2019s exports to India consist mainly of primary commodities including the following: lentils, \ncordage, cardamom, tooth powder, rice bran oil, raw jute, linseed, hides and skins of buffalo, \nfresh ginger, and ayurvedic herbs. Thus, like Bangladesh, Nepal\u2019s exports remain narrowly \nbased both in terms of product composition and market orientation. The principal Nepalese \nimports from India are higher-value goods such as textiles, medicines, vehicles and machinery, \nas well as low value bulk goods including rice, cement and coal.     \n  \n6.  In Nepal, there remains a relatively strong trade orientation towards Europe and North \nAmerica for exports.  United States (27.6%) and Germany (7.5%) are the two largest recipients \nof  Nepalese  goods  besides  India.  In  the  first  nine  months  of  FY2003/04,  exports  to  third \ncountries increased by 20.8%. Asia is the major source of Nepalese imports, but much of this is \nentrepot trade moving through Singapore and Hong Kong, China.  Besides India, the largest \nexporters to Nepal are People\u2019s Republic of China (13.2%) and United Arab Emirates (11.3%). \nThe principal non sub-region exports from Nepal are readymade garments, woolen carpets, \npashmina goods and other handicrafts.  The imports to Nepal from outside the subregion are \nmuch more diverse.  In terms of value, the principal commodities are jewelry, electrical goods \nand machinery and equipment. Table 1 shows a comparison of trade growth among SASEC \ncountries. Table 2 shows Nepal imports and exports with SASEC countries. Table 3 shows \ntrade trend of Nepal. \n \n \n                                                 \n2 It is estimated that Nepal share of trade to GDP is about 50%, (Promoting Trade in SASEC Report on Non- \n  Tariff and Non-Trade Barriers). \n3 ADB key indicators, and Nepal Central Statistics Bureau. \n ", "        Appendix 2    25 \nTable A2.1: Exports and Imports of SASEC Countries 1990\u20131999 \n \n \nCountry  Export Growth  Import Growth Export as % of Import \n \n(1990\u20131999)  (1990\u20131999)  1990  1999 \n \nBangladesh  11.7  9.6  45.7  54.1   \nBhutan  7.0  10.5  86.2  63.8   \nIndia  9.2  7.2  74.3  87.4   \nNepal  11.4  14.2  47.8  38.0   \nSource: Border Trade In The South Asian Quadrangle, Bangladesh, 2002. \n \nTable A2.2:  Nepal Exports to SASEC Countries \n(NRs million) \n \nYear  India  Bangladesh  Bhutan  Total Nepal  Subregion as \n \nTrade  % of Total \n \n1992/93  1,621      59  0.6 17,271 14.5 \n \n1993/94  2,578      22  0.4 19,247 14.2 \n \n  1994/95  3,369        7  0.1 17,926 19.1 \n  1995/96  3,683          386  0.0 19,758 20.7 \n  1996/97  5,226          498  0.6 22,862 25.2 \n  1997/98  8,794          595  6.4 27,402 35.6 \n \n1998/99  12,531  1,296  24 35,269 39.3 \n \n1999/00  22,619     128  42 50,959 44.7 \n \n2000/01  26,030      521  25 55,246 48.1 \n \n  2001/02  27,956     237  27 47,386 59.7 \n  2002/03  26,913     411  52 50,494 54.4 \n  Growth % p.a.  32.1         21.4  56.2  \n \n   p.a.=per annum \n   Source: Final Report, RETA-6139: Subregional Transport Facilitation Project. \n \nTable A2.3  Nepal Imports from SASEC Countries \n (NRs million) \n \nYear  India  Bangladesh  Bhutan  Total  Subregion \n \nImports  as % Total \n \n1992/93  12,542 211 5.1 34,425 37 \n \n  1993/94  17,868 731 1.8 51,568 37 \n  1994/95  20,791 877 0.3 64,500 34 \n  1995/96  24,399 680 30 75,896 33 \n \n1996/97  24,853 440 28 92,875 28 \n \n1997/98  27,331 366 22 88,894 32 \n \n1998/99  32,120 614 55 92,003 36 \n \n1999/00  40,928 561 40 114,955 36 \n \n  2000/01  45,211 203 52 118,787 39 \n  2001/02  56,622 643 85 108,634 53 \n  2002/03  73,738 335 36 131,041 57 \n     \nGrowth Rate % p.a.  19.4 4.7 21.6  \n \n    p.a= per annum, SASEC=South Asia and Subregional Economic Cooperation. \n  Source: Final Report, RETA-6139: Subregional Transport Facilitation Project.

Key Indicators 2004. Manila. \n \n7.  Despite the narrowness of Nepal\u2019s trading sector, trade has been a key factor behind the \nacceleration of Nepal\u2019s economic growth in the 1990s. It is estimated that Nepal\u2019s foreign trade \nmay increase annually by 15% for the next five years.  \n \n8.  The South Asia Free Trade Area is expected to reduce intra-region trade tariffs in \naccordance with a schedule as well as a degree based on the development maturity of the \nrespective member country. Member countries will eliminate non-tariff and para-tariff barriers or \nmake  them  less  restrictive  to  facilitate  intra-SAARC  trade.  Quantitative  restrictions  will  be \neliminated subject to certain conditions. Measures have been proposed for customs cooperation \nand removal of barriers for intra-SAARC investments. Generally, least developed countries4  will \nbe allowed to reduce their trade tariffs to 0-5% within a time frame of 10 years, while the non-\nLDCs (India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka) will reduce tariffs to 0-5% within a time frame of 7 years.  \n \n9.  In March 2004, Nepal became the 147th member of the WTO.  Nepal has committed to a \ntimetable of legislative reforms required to comply with WTO rules on trade related domestic \nregulations. New legislation is required on the valuation of imports for customs and taxation \npurposes conforming to the Agreement on Customs Valuation. This blocks members from using \nminimum or reference prices. Adopting WTO methods will be beneficial only after Customs \ninspectors have received training in valuation methods and have access to databases with \npricing information. It is further noted that Nepal will require technical assistance to maximize \nthe benefits of WTO membership in four areas, namely Customs Administration, Intellectual \nProperty Rights Protection, Food and Plant Sanitary Measures, and Technical Standards. Nepal \nwill have to strengthen its competitiveness in agriculture, services and manufacture production \nand  productivity,  and  create  a  better  policy  development  of  tourism,  agriculture,  services, \nmanufacturing, and for attracting foreign as well as domestic private investment especially since \nof  the  Multi-Fiber  Agreement  quotas  in  2005  will  directly  affect  Nepal\u2019s  garments  export.  \nImproved transit logistics and trade facilities are essential to provide an enabling infrastructure \nfor implementing WTO-related measures.   \n \n                                                 \n4  Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives and Nepal.  ", "        Appendix 2    27 \n10.  Nepal is characterized by long transport distance, dependence on transit routes for its \nimports and exports, poor transit logistics and trade facilities and inadequate infrastructure, \ncumbersome  goods  clearance  procedures  and  long  clearing  times  at  the  country\u2019s  major \ngateways, and a governance capacity which is yet to be improved. Increasingly, the quality of \nlogistics becoms a more important factor to affect Nepal\u2019s competitive advantages for foreign \ntrade. The total transport time needs to be reduced and transport reliability increased. Buyers, \nespecially in the retail sector, have focused on order fulfillment and reduction in order cycle time \nas critical measures of performance.  The  importance of these measures has increased with \ndemands to reduce inventories throughout the supply chain and to deliver goods direct from the \nfactory to the final point of sale. Exporters rely on improved performance of not only outbound \nlogisitics to ensure timely delivery to buyers but also inbound logistics to reduce inventory costs \nand more importantly to reduce the order cycle for their products.   \n \n11.  Nepal has one of the most liberalized trade policies in the subregion. It has one of the \nlowest average tariffs and no non-tariff barriers. With SAFTA agreements, accession to WTO \nand strengthened subregional trade and investment cooperation, Nepal\u2019s trade within SASEC \nregion and other countries will increase. This stresses the increasing demand for improved \nlogistics and trade facilities to reduce transaction cost with respect to transport and cargo \nclearance cost and delivery reliability. It will also help to convert informal trade and increase the \ncountry\u2019s revenue from duties and taxes. \n ", "28         Appendix 3\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO ROAD AND MULTIMODAL TRANSPORT SECTOR  \nSource of  Loan/  Length  (Expected) \nFunds Project Grant (km)/No Completion\nADB Hetauda-Narayanghar Road (upgrade) Loan 78 1981\nADB Feeder Roads Loan 116 1995\nADB Silgadhi-Sanfebagar Road Loan 67 1995\nADB Road Improvement Loan 198 1995\nADB Second Road  Improvement Loan 686 1997\nADB Third Road Improvement Loan 269 2001\nADB Road Network Development Project Loan 410 2007\nChina Naubise-Pokhara Grant 174 1974\nChina Narayanghar-Mugling-Gorkha Grant 61 1982\nChina Pokhara-Baglung Grant 71 1994\nChina Kathmandu Ringroad Grant 27 1974\nChina Syaprubesi-Rasuwa Grant 16 2006\nGermany Malekhu-Dhadhing Grant 17 2001\nGermany Bhianse-Hetauda Grant 11 1998\nIndia Bhainse-Hetauda Grant 114 1956\nIndia Kathmandu-Trisuli Grant 68 1963\nIndia Sunali-Pokhara Grant 181 1972\nIndia Kakarbita-Dhalkebar Grant 258 1974\nIndia Butwal-Kohalpur Grant 236 1985\nIndia Kohalphur-Mahakali Grant 204 1993\nJapan Banepa-Sindhuli-Bardibas Grant 158 2009\nSwitzerland Lamosangu-Jiri Grant 110 1984\nSwitzerland Arniko Highway Maintenance Project Grant 96 2001\nSwitzerland Road Resealing Works Grant 26 2005\nUK Dharan-Dhankuta Grant 55 1984\nUK Damak-Belbari (rehabilitation) Grant 23 1997\nUK Jogbeni-Dhankuta (rehabilitation) Grant 100 1997\nUK Kakarbita-Damak (rehabilitation) Grant 49 2001\nUK Hile-Bhojpur Grant 94 2007\nUK Basantpur-Terathum Grant 27 2007\nUK Bhalubang-Puyathan Grant 69 2007\nUK Butwal-Narayanghat Grant 115 1975\nUNDP Bardibas-Jaleshwor Grant 42 2001\nUNDP Janakpur-Dhanushadham Grant 16 2001\nUSA Hetauda-Naryanghat Grant 78 1967\nUSA Raxaual-Bhainse (upgrade) Grant 71 1967\nUSA Dhangadhi-Dadeldhura Grant 135 1979\nUSA Rapti Integrated Road Project Grant 201 1986\nUSSR Pathaliya-Dhalkebar Grant 109 1972\nWB/UK/UNDP/  Loan/ \nSwitzerland Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project Grant 1,111 1999\nMultimodal Transit and Trade Facilitation \nWB Project Loan 2003\nWB Road Maintenance and Development Project Loan 1,083 2004\nADB = Asian Development Bank, UK = United Kingdom, UNDP = United Nations Development Programme,\nUSA = United States of America, WB = World Bank.\nSource: Ministry of Physical and Public Works, Nepal.", "                         Appendix 4            29\nDETAILED PROJECT COST ESTIMATE\n($,000)\nForeign Local Total ADB Financing Government\nItem Exchange Currency  Cost FX LC Financingd\nLC\nA.

The  overall  economic  analysis  evaluated  four  subprojects:  (i)  Bhairawa  road \nrehabilitation, (ii) Birganj road rehabilitation, (iii) road ICD development at Kakarbita, and (iv) \nASYCUDA installation at all transit points. The improved road sections and trade facilitation will \nreduce vehicle operating costs (VOCs) and travel time, which will stimulate economic growth in \nthe project area. Cost-benefit analysis was conducted for each subproject and for the overall \nproject. The Bhairawa and Birganj road subprojects were evaluated on the basis of estimated \nsavings in transport costs using the highway design and maintenance model (HDM4), modified \nfor Nepal. The two other subprojects\u2014customs improvement using ASYCUDA installation, and \nroad ICD development at Kakarbita\u2014were evaluated on the basis of savings in costs of cross-\nborder goods movement. \n \n2.  Bhairawa-Butwal  Section.  The  Bhairawa-Butwal  road  section  is  part  of  Sidthartha \nHighway (Bhairawa-Butwal-Palpa-Pokhara). This section was rehabilitated as a two-lane road \nwith DBST in 1998\u20131999. Within the last 20 years, many industries were established along the \nroad corridor, resulting in continuous ribbon development throughout the road\u2019s length. Market \ncenters such as Anchalapur, Manglapur, and Shankernagar are already developed, with all the \nurban facilities (telephone, electricity, tap water) and local public transport such as microbuses \nand local buses. The travel distance from Bhairawa-Butwal-Bhumahi is about 41 kilometers \n(km). The Project road\u2014Bhairawa-Parasi-Bhumahi (about 29 km)\u2014will shorten it by about 29%.  \n \n3.  Birganj-Pathlaiya (East-West Highway). The Birganj-Pathlaiya section of Tribhuvan \nHighway was one of Nepal\u2019s first road projects, during late 1950s. Pavement works with two-\nlane  asphalt  concrete  pavement  were  reconstructed  or  rehabilitated  during  1995\u20131998. \nBetween Birganj and Pathlaiya are three markets\u2014Simara, Jeetpur, and Parawanipur. Some \nsections of the Tribhuvan Highway, particularly the market areas and the municipal limits of \nBirganj, are congested due to local mixed traffic, reducing vehicle speeds. In the \u201dwithout  case\u201d, \ntraffic will continue to grow until design levels are exceeded in about 3 years, and level of \nservice will begin to decline (i.e., traffic will slow down and delays increase) and alternative \nroutes and traffic management evolve to handle the congestion.  \n \nB.  Traffic Demand \n \n1.  Existing Traffic \n \n4.  Current traffic volumes on the project roads and the transit point were determined from \ntraffic counts in April, May, and June 2004, which were normalized with a seasonal factor to \nestimate annual average daily traffic, especially considering monsoon impacts. The level of \ntraffic was further adjusted to take into account political uncertainty. Table A9.1 summarizes the \nresultant traffic level used for the analysis, considering these risks, which is regarded as the \nworst-case scenario. The sensitivity tests will consider additional impacts. \n   ", "40   Appendix 9 \nTable A9.1: Traffic on the Project Roads and the Transit Points in 2004 \n \nRoad   MT  NMT \nBhairawa Road \nBhairawa-Bhumahi Section  951  3,178 \nBhairawa-Butwal Section  2,160  3,447 \nButwal-Bhumahi Section  1,112  2,476 \nBirganj Road \nJeetpur-Padam Rd JCT  4,224  1,269 \nPadam Rd JCT-ICD  2,869  2,037 \nKakarbita \nKakarbita ICD  1,811  1,885 \nICD = inland clearance depot; JCT = junction; MT = motorized traffic;  \nNMT = nonmotorized traffic. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n2.  Traffic Growth \n \n5.  The annual GDP growth rate of 5% is adopted for the economic assessment, which is \nconsistent with current World Bank and ADB projections for GDP growth rates for Nepal, \nassuming that the security situation is brought under control. \n \n6.  Empirical evidence shows that transport demand tends to expand more quickly than \neconomic growth, as measured by national and regional GDPs. This relationship is called \ntransport demand elasticity. In Nepal, previous studies by ADB and the World Bank have used \nan elasticity of demand for transport of 1.6 on average, which is used as a starting point for the \nanalysis. \n \n7.  Table A9.2 summarizes the traffic growth rates. For a long-term projection (2020\u20132028), \nelasticity is assumed to decrease to 1.2 from 1.6. For nonmotorized traffic (NMT), the growth \nrate is assumed to be lower than the rate of motorized traffic (MT), considering that a modal \nshift will occur from NMT to MT due to economic development. \n \nTable A9.2:  Traffic Growth Rates \n  \nGDP  MT  MT  NMT \nGrowth Rate  Elasticity  Growth Rate  Growth Ratea \nYear  (%)    (%)  (%) \n2004\u20132019  5  1.6  8  6 \n2020\u20132028  5  1.2  6  5 \nGDP = gross domestic product; MT = motorized traffic; NMT = nonmotorized traffic. \na Assuming about 20% lower than MT growth rate. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n \n8.  The average traffic growth rate per annum between 1995 and 2004 recorded by the \nDOR indicates that the rates for Bhairawa (14.0%) and Birganj (12.2%) are considerably higher \nthan 8.0% assumed in Table A9.2, which is considered as a conservative estimate.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix  9  41 \n \n  3.  Diverted and Generated Traffic \n \n9.  Based on the origin-destination (OD) survey conducted in June 2004, the rate of diverted \nand generated traffic was estimated as follows.  \n \na.   Bhairawa Road Subcomponent   \n \n10.  Improvement of the Bhairawa-Bhumahi (BB) section will result in more traffic diverted \nfrom the Bhairawa-Butwal-Bhumahi (BBB) section as the subproject route will be shorter for \nthrough-traffic and will reduce VOC and time costs. Based on the OD analysis of traffic, it was \nestimated that 30% of the traffic on the BBB section would be diverted to the BB section after \nproject completion. The rate of about 20%1 was assumed for generated traffic on the BB \nsection, which has been added to the normal and diverted traffic. \n \nb.   Birganj Road Subcomponent   \n \n11.  Construction  of  the  Birganj  bypass  will  attract  traffic  from  the  existing  Jeetpur-ICD \nsection. Based on the OD survey, it was estimated that 25% of the traffic on the existing \nJeetpur-Birganj section would be diverted to the Birganj bypass after project completion. The \nestimate of a relatively low rate of 25% is reasonable, considering that some traffic to and from \nthe ICD would still travel through the existing road as it passes through the highly built-up \nBirganj township. No generated traffic was considered for this subcomponent as improvements \nto sections at Jeetpur and ICD access are so short that little generated traffic is expected. \n \n4.  Kakarbita ICD and Transit Points for ASYCUDA Installation \n \n12.  The  five  major  border  crossings  into  India  are  Nepalganj,  Bhairawa,  Birganj,  and \nBiratnagar, all on the southern border, and Kakarbita on the eastern border. In terms of trade \nvalue,2  Birganj is the most important, accounting for about 50% each of the country's trade with \nIndia and with third countries. Bhairawa accounts for 16% for trade with India, and 17% with \nthird countries. Kakarbita accounts for 7% of trade with India and 6% with third countries, mainly \nwith Bangladesh and Bhutan. The Subregional Corridor Operational Efficiency Study3 presented \nestimates of tonnage crossing the border between Nepal and India at Birganj, which accounted \nfor a total of 0.87 million tons for exports and import cargo in 2003. A traffic survey in April and \nMay 2004 indicates 1,811 motorized vehicles at the Kakarbita border point. This economic \nassessment assumes the same traffic growth rate used for the road subprojects. \n \nC.  Costs \n \n13.  For road rehabilitation components, the road section will be upgraded to two DBST lanes \n7.0  meters  (m)  wide,  with  a  1.5  m  hard  shoulder  on  each  side.  Routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance are assumed to be carried out in accordance with current DOR practice and DOR \nroad plan standards. \n \n14.  The costs for road ICD development at Kakarbita consist of (i) upgrading the proposed \nICD, including very short access roads; (ii) customs facilities for passengers and freight; and (iii) \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2001.

The economic evaluation includes the estimated costs of maintenance of \n1.5% for these facilities. \n \n15.  For  the  customs  improvement  with  ASYCUDA  installation  at  all  transit  points,  the \nASYCUDA modules are provided free, but additional infrastructure and training are required. \nThe economic evaluation included periodic replacement of equipment every 5 years at 20% of \nthe original equipment cost. \n \n16.  The Project\u2019s economic costs were derived from the financial costs and include the cost \nof construction and maintenance. Economic costs exclude price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties. Following studies by ADB and the World Bank, a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 \nwas used to arrive at economic costs at the world price level for non-tradeable goods. \n \nD.  Benefits \n \n1.  Road Rehabilitation Component \n \n17.  The main quantifiable benefits of the investment are savings in VOCs and travel time. \nVOC savings were calculated using HDM4 for each vehicle type. The benefits for generated \ntraffic are considered to be 50% of those for normal traffic, while the benefits of diverted traffic \nare estimated by comparing them with benefits when traffic uses existing roads. All benefits \nwere converted to the tradeable goods by applying SCF of 0.9. \n \n2.  Customs Improvement and ICD Development Component \n \n18.  For ASYCUDA installation, the quantified economic benefits include (i) time savings for \ntruck owners and operators (45 minutes saving per goods movement); and (ii) reduced cost of \nworking capital for exporters, importers, retailers, etc. (assumed annual interest rate of 12%). \nThese benefits accrue because they enable the number of cargo inspections to be reduced. \n \n19.  For  the  Kakarbita  ICD,  quantified  economic  benefits  (i)  reduced  losses  from  cargo \ndamage and theft (0.15% of the value, assuming 30.00% of probability of theft and damage with \naverage insurance costs of 0.50% of the value), (ii) time savings for owners of trucks and buses \n(15 minutes saving per freight and passenger movement), (iii) reduction in working capital \nrequired for cargo owners (assumed interest rate of 12.00% pa), and (iv) time savings for \ncustoms brokers and customs officers (15 minutes per transaction). \n \n20.  For all subprojects, the value of timesavings per hour was estimated on the basis of \nincome of drivers, helpers, and passengers, for each type of vehicle.  \n \nE.   Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) \n \n21.  An economic evaluation was undertaken for each subproject by comparing cases \u201cwith\u201d \nand \u201cwithout\u201d the Project. Only quantifiable benefits were considered. Each subproject was \nevaluated  up  to  2028,  providing  benefit  periods  of  20  years  after  all  the  subprojects  are \nimplemented. Residual values of 10% and 20% were applied in 2028 for the Bhairawa and \nBirganj road subprojects, respectively. The Birganj road subproject has large residual value as it \ninvolves  more  earthworks,  which  will  have  more  economic  value  beyond  the  end  of  the \nevaluation period. For the Kakarbita ICD and ASYCUDA subcomponents, 30% and 0% residual \nvalues  were  assumed,  respectively,  based  on  the  value  of  civil  works  and  equipment \nconstructed or installed. All costs and benefits were expressed in 2004 constant prices. \n ", "  Appendix  9  43 \n22.  The  economic  evaluation  was  on  a  network  basis  for  Bhairawa  and  Birganj \nsubcomponents to better take into account costs and benefits from the network perspective due \nto the bypass construction. For the Bhairawa subcomponent, the network considered consists of \nthree sections of Bhairawa-Bhumahi, Bhairawa-Butwal, and Butwal-Bhumahi. For the Birganj \nsubcomponent,  the  network  considered  consists  of  five  sections  of  Jeetpur-Pawanipur, \nPawanipur-Padam road junction (JCT), Padam road JCT-Old Padam road JCT, Old Padam \nroad JCT-ICD, and the bypass. \n \n23.  The base case EIRR results in 32.7%, 18.1%, 15.2%, and 46.6%, respectively, for \nBhairawa  road  rehabilitation,  Birganj  road  rehabilitation,  Kakarbita  ICD  development,  and \nASYCUDA installation. They demonstrate sound economic viability. \n \nF.  Sensitivity Analysis of EIRR \n \n24.  The sensitivity of EIRR for the overall Project was analyzed with respect to changes in \nthe cost-and-benefit streams. Seven sensitivity test cases were examined: (i) construction costs \nincreased by 25%, (ii) construction period extended by 2 years, (iii) no generated traffic, (iv) no \ntime savings, (v) traffic growth rates reduced by 25%, (vi) total benefits reduced by 25%, and \n(vii) the combination of the cases (i) and (vi). \n \n25.  Table A9.3 summarized the results showing that the quantified economic benefits are \nconsidered robust to various sensitivity tests. Only for the Kakarbita subcomponent, the EIRR \nfalls below 12% for two cases where total benefits are reduced by 25% (case [vi]) and where the \ncombination  of  benefit  reduction  and  cost  increase  occurs  (case  [vii]).  Though  the  EIRR \nbecomes less than 12% for these cases, it is not far below for case (vi), and the probability of \nthese occurring, especially case (vii), is small. Furthermore, all these figures are based on the \nconservative  estimation  of  growth  rate,  considering  risks  of  occurring  impassability  due  to \npolitical and natural causes. No impact on traffic growth induced by improved transit and trade \nagreements  being  deliberated  by  SASEC  and  SAARC  has  been  considered,  which  will \ngenerally increase traffic growth with the subregion as well as the region. Savings from accident \nreduction are not considered. \n \nTable A9.3: Results of Sensitivity Tests \n  \n    EIRR (%)     \nCase  Bhairawa  Birganj  Kakarbita  ASYCUDA \nBase Case  32.7  18.1  15.2  46.6 \n(i)    Construction Costs Increased by 25%  30.1  16.2  12.1  38.8 \n(ii)   Construction Period Extended by 1 Yeara  31.5  17.9  14.6  \u2014 \n(iii)  No Generated Trafficb  28.4  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \n(iv)  No Time-Savingsc  22.6  16.4  \u2014  \u2014 \n(v)   Traffic Growth Rates Reduced by 25%d  22.5  12.4  \u2014  \u2014 \n(vi)  Total Benefits Reduced by 25%  28.1  15.7  11.3  36.2 \n(vii)  Combination of Cases (i) and (vi)  24.9  14.0  8.9  28.6 \na  The system installation will not likely take more than a year. \nb  No generated traffic was assumed for Birganj, Kakarbita, and ASYCUDA subcomponents. \nc Time savings are only benefits considered for the Kakarbita and ASYCUDA subcomponents. \nd  The case of 25% reduction of traffic growth rate is considered for Bhairawa and Birganj subcomponents to  \n   reflect the risk of toll impacts. \nSource: Consultant\u2019s estimates. \n   ", " 44 Appendix 10 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Kakarbita Inland Clearance Depot  \n \n1.  Financial analysis has been carried out for the Kakarbita Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) in \naccordance with Guidelines for the Financial Analysis and Management of Investment Projects of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB). The purpose is to determine whether or not the financial \nbenefits of establishing an additional dry port will exceed the financial costs. Financial analysis \nwas initially carried out from a project perspective, assuming that the Project would be owner \noperated. The costs and benefits were based on the same assumptions used in the economic \nanalysis. Nonmotorized vehicles are excluded since nonmotorized traffic (NMT) rarely uses ICDs. \nThe project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to real terms \nby adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency fluctuation. \nTable A10.1 shows that the estimated financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is at about 9.8%. \nThis compares favorably with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), also computed on an \nafter-tax  basis,  of  1.3%  (Table  A10.2).  The  Project  is  considered  financially  viable  and \nsustainable. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the FIRR for the Kakarbitta ICD is robust under \nmost conditions (Table A10.3). Balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow projections were \nprepared for the ICD, assuming it will be operated by a private operator.  \n \nTable A10.1: Estimated FIRR of Kakarbita ICD from Owner/Operator Scenario \n(NRs million at 2004 Constant Price) \n \nOperating  Cash Flow  Income Tax  Net Cash \nYear  Civil Construction  Plant  Expenses  Revenue  before Tax  25%  Flow \n2005  95.71        (95.71)    (95.71) \n2006  95.71        (95.71)    (95.71) \n2007    9.26  21.71  25.81  (10.66)    (5.16) \n2008      22.58  33.41  10.83  2.71  8.13 \n2009      23.48  40.06  16.58  4.14  12.43 \n2010      24.42  43.23  18.81  4.70  14.10 \n2011      25.40  46.65  21.25  5.31  15.94 \n2012      26.41  50.34  23.93  5.98  17.95 \n2013      27.47  54.33  26.87  6.72  20.15 \n2014      28.57  58.65  30.08  7.52  22.56 \n2015      29.71  63.30  33.59  8.40  25.19 \n2016      30.90  68.33  37.43  9.36  28.07 \n2017    18.52  32.13  73.76  12.11  3.03  17.33 \n2018      33.42  79.62  46.20  11.55  34.65 \n2019      34.76  85.96  51.20  12.80  38.40 \n2020      36.15  92.80  56.65  14.16  42.49 \n2021      37.59  100.19  62.59  15.65  46.95 \n2022      39.10  108.17  69.07  17.27  51.80 \n2023      40.66  116.78  76.12  19.03  57.09 \n2024      42.29  126.09  83.80  20.95  62.85 \n2025      43.98  136.14  92.16  23.04  69.12 \n2026  (57.40)    45.74  147.00  196.97  49.24  118.99 \n            FIRR  9.8% \nFIRR: financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultant\u2019s estimates (RETA 6139). \n ", "                    Appendix 10  45\nTable A10.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nADB  Government \nItem  Loan  Funds  Total \nA.

Assumptions. The ICD\u2019s sources of operating revenues are assumed to be derived from \nfees  for  entry,  loading  and  unloading,  stuffing  and  unstuffing,  container  handling,  weighing, \nparking, and sublease. Each revenue source is growing at 8% per annum, except sublease,1 \nwhich is static. Operational expenses are increasing at 4% per annum. Depreciation is 10% per \nannum for equipment assets. This is in line with existing ICDs\u2019 operating experience. Domestic \ninflation is 5%. \n \n3.  Analysis was carried out under the assumption that the operation and maintenance (O&M) \nof the ICD are assumed to be privatized immediately after construction. Lease fees will benefit the \nGovernment as in other dry ports in Nepal. Since the private operator will be responsible for O&M \nof the ICD assets as obligated under the lease contract, only the construction cost and lease fees \nwere considered. The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether or not the assumed lease \nprice is appropriate for the Government in terms of its debt service obligations for the ICD, and its \ntrade facilitation obligations, and balance of benefits forgone with avoided risk. The lease fees are \nestimated with reference (pro rata) to those being applied to the Bhairawa and Biratnagar ICDs, \nresulting in about NRs3.8 million per year for the first 3 years and then increasing to about \nNRs11.5 million per year for years 7\u201310, then rising to NRs17.2 million for the remainder of the \nanalysis period to reflect that the second 10-year lease would be renegotiated in a favorable \nbusiness climate. About three years will be needed for the business operation to move from start-\nup to a reasonable profit level, so the annual lease payment to NITDB has been assumed as less \n                                                 \n1 The terminal management company will sublease office space to the customs brokers and agents. \n   ", " 46 Appendix 10 \nthan the annual full charge of normal operation period for the initial three years. This assumption \nis consistent with the recent lease agreement for the Birganj ICD. The estimated FIRR under this \nscenario is about 3.9% (Table A10.4). Given that the bulk of operating risks was being passed on \nto the lessee, a lease structure similar to the other ICDs appears suitable.  \n \nTable A10.4: Estimated FIRR, Leasing Scenario  \n(NRs million at 2004 constant price) \n \nYear  Construction  Lease Income  Net Income \nCost \n2005  95.71    (95.71) \n2006  95.71    (95.71) \n2007    3.83   3.83 \n2008    3.83   3.83 \n2009    3.83   3.83 \n2010    11.48   11.48 \n2011    11.48   11.48 \n2012    11.48   11.48 \n2013    11.48   11.48 \n2014    11.48   11.48 \n2015    11.48   11.48 \n2016    11.48   11.48 \n2017    17.23   17.23 \n2018    17.23   17.23 \n2019    17.23   17.23 \n2020    17.23   17.23 \n2021    17.23   17.23 \n2022    17.23   17.23 \n2023    17.23   17.23 \n2024    17.23   17.23 \n2025    17.23   17.23 \n2026  (57.40)  17.23   74.63 \n    FIRR  3.9% \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultant\u2019s estimates (RETA 6139). \n \nB.   Inland Clearance Depot Business Case \n \n4.  Two FIRR scenarios and a 10-year forecast for the private sector to operate the ICD were \nprepared (Supplementary Appendix E, Tables 6 A and B for forecast financial statements). The \nfirst FIRR assumes an owner-operator scenario, reflecting Government policy to promote private \nsector development and participation. The reason for providing the first FIRR is to assess whether \nthe private sector will invest in ICD construction rather than just operation and maintenance. None \nof the existing ICDs have attracted private sector investment for construction and civil works \nbecause of the highly risky political and security situation. The first FIRR of 10% is viable but not \nenough to attract the private sector as an owner-operator. The second FIRR is important in that it \nshows that the predicted lease revenues would comfortably cover the Government\u2019s debt service \nfor building the new ICD.  \n \n ", "                    Appendix 10  47\n5.  The financial projections for the ICD (with the private sector as the operator or lessee) \nindicate that the lease scenario is viable and will attract the private sector to invest in plant and \nequipment and operate under lease. The projections assume an initial equity injection of NRs. \n10.00 million to finance plant and equipment and start-up cash. The equity injection by the private \nsector lessee could be recovered in about year 3 of operations. The nature of the ICD lease or \noperation  is  not  capital  intensive.  Virtually  all  revenues  are  cash  (through  brokers),  and \nreceivables and inventories are not significant. Thus, the only significant current asset would be \ncash. Current liabilities (accounts payable) are insignificant. \n \nC.  Border Access Roads \n \n6.  The Project includes placing tolls on two border roads. The Government practice for tolling \nis to meet the maintenance cost, i.e., from routine to periodic maintenance (main text, footnote \n10), with the toll level to be set per trip of about 80\u2013100 kilometer (km), and depending on road \nconditions, strategic importance, traffic volume, and vehicle types. While the details of the toll-\nsetting  mechanism  will  be  determined  during  project  implementation,  preliminary  financial \nanalysis has been undertaken. Traffic forecasts and maintenance costs have been calculated and \nprojected for the two roads. The toll rate will assumed to be similar to that being applied on similar \nroads in Nepal (NRs0.36/km/vehicle). On the basis of this analysis, Table A9.5 shows that with \nthe given toll rates, the toll roads will generate sufficient revenue to cover maintenance costs, \nincluding periodic maintenance. The actual toll level and collection methodology will be formulated \nduring project implementation to recover costs up to and including periodic maintenance level, \nwithout  diverting  the  project  objective  to  reduce  transport  costs  for  the  traded  goods  and \nstrengthen the country\u2019s competitiveness in the trade sector.  \n \nTable A10.5: Test Cash Flow for Border Access Roads \n \nYear  Toll Revenue  Periodic  Routine  Net \nMaintenance  Maintenance  Cash Flow \nCost  Cost \n2009  17.7    1.8  15.9 \n2010  19.1    1.8  17.3 \n2011  20.6    1.8  18.8 \n2012  22.3    1.8  20.5 \n2013  24.1    1.8  22.3 \n2014  26.0  8.2  1.8  16.0 \n2015  28.1  31.6  1.8  (5.3) \n2016  30.3    1.8  28.5 \n2017  32.7    1.8  30.9 \n2018  35.3    1.8  33.5 \n2019  38.2    1.8  36.4 \n2020  40.5    1.8  38.7 \n2021  42.9  18.6  1.8  22.5 \n2022  45.5  71.8  1.8  (28.1) \n2023  48.2    1.8  46.4 \n2024  51.1    1.8  49.3 \n2025  54.2    1.8  52.4 \n2026  57.4    1.8  55.6 \n2027  60.8    1.8  59.0 \n2028  64.5    1.8  62.7 \nSource: Asian Development Bank and TA consultant\u2019s estimates.  \n \n   ", " 48 Appendix 10 \nD.

DOR transactions are recorded on historical cost. DOR \nprepares a project annual financial statement, which incorporates various project implementation \nunits  (PIUs).  The  PIU  will  lead  in  formulating  the  budget,  obtaining  the  flow  of  accounting \ninformation for all project components, and reconciling and preliminarily auditing such information. \nThe project site offices are required to submit monthly statements of expenditures to the PIU \nwithin 7 days of the following month. As per Government requirement, an imprest account will be \nmaintained at Nepal Rastra Bank. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will allocate annual budgets to \nthe Project as envisaged in the annual work plan and as agreed on between the Government and \nADB. The Government will include this Project under the list of core projects, and will commit to a \ntimely release of funds. DOR will allocate adequate resources to the PIU for the Project, which \nshould include qualified staff, including financial management staff, equipment and budget, to \nadminister  overall  project  implementation.

The Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s (AGO) Office of Nepal, which is considered an independent auditor for ADB\u2019s purpose, \nwill annually audit the project accounts and financial statements. A project management report \nsystem has been set up on a project basis, to generate reports on project progress, procurement, \ninventory, and others of the system. Out of the report, a financial management system is being \nextended for two years to all DOR branches and offices, and will include the Project, which, once \ncompleted, will enhance DOR\u2019s and the PIU\u2019s institutional capacity in financial management with \nrespect to expenditures, accounts, inventory, cash flow, budgeting, management information, and \nfinancial control. In consideration of diversity of the nature of project components and sites, and \nprocedures involved between MPPW, MOF, and AGO, unaudited and audited project accounts \nand financial statements will be submitted to ADB within six and nine months, respectively, after \nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate.  \n \n2.  Nepal Intermodal Transport and Development Board (NITDB) \n \n8.  NITDB was established in 1997 to (i) develop, manage, and promote ICD terminals to \nfacilitate Nepal\u2019s exports and imports; (ii) enter into agreement with private companies selected by \ncompetitive bidding for leasing out the management and operation of ICD terminals; (iii) prescribe \ncriteria to determine the ceiling of service charges of the terminal operation;2 and (iv) conclude a \nrailway operation agreement with Indian Railways for rail movement of cargo to and from ICDs. \nThe chairperson of the Board is the Secretary, Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies, and \nthe board consists of members from the public and private sectors. The Kakarbita ICD will be \nimplemented by the PIU under DOR, but NITDB will send technical staff to join the PIU. The \noperation and maintenance of the ICD will be leased out to a private transport management \ncompany. Therefore, NITDB is not directly concerned with loan disbursement of the ADB loan. In \nthis regard, NITDB is not required to submit audited financial statements to ADB during project \nimplementation. Being a Government agency, NITDB maintains its accounting system on a cash \n                                                 \n2 The ceiling is in place to facilitate trade. \n \n \n ", "                    Appendix 10  49\nbasis.

An improved sub-regional transport network will reduce \nthe  cost  of  imports  and  exports  between  Nepal,  and  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  India  and  third \ncountries. Increased sub-regional trade and investment, will contribute to economic growth and \npoverty reduction by creating jobs and developing local, national, and international markets. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Poverty Classification: \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe  Project  covers  inland  clearance  depot  (ICD)  development  in  Kakarbita;  widening  and \nimprovement of existing access roads in Birganj, Bhairawa, Parasi; and Jitpur (41.4 kilometer \n[km]) connecting the east-west highway. The access roads and realignment will be upgraded \nand widened to two lanes. The Project covers five districts\u2014Bara, Parsa, Jhapa, Nawalparasi, \nand Rupandehi. The main objective of the Project is to improve access roads, customs, and \nfreight\u2013handling  facilities  to  ensure  efficient  trans-shipment  of  goods,  commodities,  and \npassenger traffic at principal border crossings in Nepal. Thus, the Project will promote pro-poor, \nbroad-based  economic  growth  by  connecting  people  to  markets  and  better  economic \nopportunities by facilitating trade links with the neighboring countries. \n \nNepal is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a poverty incidence of 38%, which is \nmore  severe  in  the  rural  hills  and  mountains  than  in  urban  areas  and  the  rural  Terai. \nDemographic health indicators1 of poverty reveal that Nepal ranks 54th, just ahead of India, with \nthe highest and similar trends in maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate and life expectancy \nat  birth.  The  poverty  deprivation  index,  based  on  population,  nutrition,  and  income \ncharacteristics,  reveals  that  the  project  districts  in  the  Terai  are  the  intermediate  to  most \ndeveloped in Nepal. Social assessment indicates that the communities in the project influence \narea2 have living standards much above the minimum national poverty line (NRs6,100/capita). \nHowever, as per 1999 figures,3 nearly 42% of the people in the terai still live below the poverty \nline, with the absolute number of poor people increasing sharply over the years. \n \nAlthough not designed as a poverty intervention, the Project will connect the poor and excluded \nto  market  opportunities  so  they  can  participate  competitively  in  the  national  and  global \neconomies.  The  Project  will  help  foster  strong  links  between  the  national,  regional,  and \ninternational markets, leading to a transition from a subsistence to a market\u2013oriented economy \nby  increasing  international  competition  from  India  and  other  countries  through  regional \ncooperation. \n \n                                                \n1  UNICEF. 2004.

It will improve \naccess to local, national, and international markets, create jobs and employment opportunities \nnot only in the influence area but also in other regions within Nepal and will promote export and \nimport of agricultural and nonagricultural commodities and other items due to easier and faster \naccess from the border area and from within Nepal to the surrounding districts. Increased trade \nwill  in  return  generate  demand  for  the  growth  of  local  trade  and  enterprises  and,  hence, \nincreased employment opportunities.  \n \nBetter\u2013quality  access  roads  and  efficient  customs  systems  will  speed  up  travel  and  cargo \ntransport. Savings to the vehicle operator through the reduction in VOC will be passed on to the \nindividual shipper in the form of lower freight rates. The decrease in the cost of movement of \nfreight will also reduce the cost of the product. Cheaper cost of transport will benefit people \nlooking for seasonal work during agricultural slack times.  \n \nAccess to international markets, better road conditions, and faster cargo transportation will lead \nto growth of industries, allowing them to move out of central Nepal to the border areas, creating \njobs there. Rural labor will benefit from road construction jobs during project implementation.  \n \nIncreased trade will lead to more resource mobilization, allowing the Government to allocate \ntimely funds for health, education, water supply, sanitation, rural electrification, and other basic \nservices as projected in the 10th Five-Year Plan period. These will account for as about 40% of \ntotal Government annual expenditure for FY2004/05. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nConsultations and meetings with the various Project communities were organized during the \nsocial analysis to ascertain their response to improved cross-border facilities, project needs and \ndemands, and an estimate of the communities\u2019 losses and steps to mitigate them. Focus group \ndiscussions were organized during the social appraisal among men, women, farmers, traders, \nbusinessmen,  traders  and  travelers  from  across  the  border,  indigenous  people  and  ethnic \nminorities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  customs  officials  to  ensure  a \ncomprehensive perspective on the Project and its impacts. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nAs no development activity can be gender neutral, women's participation in project design was \nensured during project preparation. A gender analysis was done to see the impact of the Project \non  women.  The  Project  is  anticipated  to  have  a  positive  impact  on  men  and  women  by \nincreasing access to basic social services (schools, health care facilities, and markets) and \ncreating employment opportunities. During project design, women raised concerns about the \nrisks  of  HIV/AIDS4  and  human  trafficking  in  the  sub-project  sites.  To  fully  address  these \nproblems  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human-trafficking  prevention  program  has  been  developed \n(Supplementary Appendix G), for which the project executing agency will be responsible. \n                                                \n4 human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.

Description of the Environment \n \n    1.      Physical Environment \n \n3.  The project areas lie within Nepal\u2019s terai region in which they are located between 91 to \n380 meters (m) above sea level. However, topography of each project area is mostly flat. \nRainfall in the project area varies moderately from 1,450 millimeter (mm) per year in the western \nterai to 1,900 mm per year in the eastern terai. Rainfall occurs during the monsoon seasons \nfrom June to September, and January to March, due to moisture brought by the northeastern \nwind.    Temperature  reaches  44\u00baC  from  April  to  May,  and  falls  to  5\u00baC  from  November  to \nFebruary. The Bhairawa project area has several small rivers such as the Rohani, Zharai, \nBangela, Danda and Mahao, all of which are seasonal and only about 6 m deep on average, \nduring dry season. Ground-water can be found at 5\u201310 m. The soil is dominated by alluvial type.  \n \n    2.      Ecological Environment \n \n4.  The Project will not cover ecologically sensitive areas. Most vegetation consists of home \ngardens. No important species or fauna live in the project area. Domestic animals such as \nbuffalos, cow, chickens and duck are common in the area.     \n \n         3.     Social and Economic Environment \n \n5.  Most  economic  activities  and,  therefore,  land  use,  in  almost  all  project  areas  are \nagricultural. However, the Birganj project road area is located in industrial area that mostly \ndominated by the textile and leather industries. Except in Kakarbita, most people also work in \nservice industries such as hotel, and transport, and as wage labor, loading goods, and have \npoor sanitation facilities, and little clean water or electricity.        \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n      1.  Impact due to Project\u2019s Location \n \n6.  As they are not in environmentally sensitive areas, the three project components will \nhave no significant environmental impact. The Bhairawa road project will improve the existing \nroad. The Birganj road project will realign the existing road and lengthen by 9.5 km. The \nKakarbhita ICD will require construction of buildings within the existing ICD area.   \n \n2.   Impact due to Construction and Operation of both Road Projects \n  \n7.  The environmental impacts of construction will include: (i) disruption of traffic in the \nconstruction area, (ii) increased air pollution due to dust and other volatile chemical substances \nfrom the asphalt plant, (iii) noise and vibration, and (iv) disruption of water system due to filling \nto  increase  embankment  and  work  related  to  construction  of  bridges  and  culverts.  These \nimpacts will occur only during construction. However, the following mitigation measures will \nminimize these impacts: (i) reroute traffic with clear sign; (ii) keep the optimum moisture content \nduring handling of soil, spray water to minimize dust, and maintain a safe distance between the \nasphalt plant and public facilities, including education facilities; (iii) strictly control construction \nworks that create noise and vibration, by prohibiting night work in residential areas; (iv) pump \nout stagnant water, and provide adequate drainage system; (v) stabilize road embankment side \nslopes in the area where a high level embankment is required; and (vi) restrict construction in \nflood areas to the dry season, and avoid road widening near pond\u2019s site. In addition, several ", "      Appendix 12  55\n     \n       \ntemporary access roads will be established to transport construction material and machinery to \nconstruct the road between Birganj and Jeetpur. As soon as possible after construction works \nare completed, the contractor will be required to rehabilitate the access road to restore their \npreconstruction conditions. All these mitigation requirements will be included in the contractor\u2019s \ncontracts. Clearly, all impacts are temporary and manageable.  \n \n8.  The other important environmental impact that will not concentrate in the road areas is \nthe borrow pits excavation. Since construction materials will not be gathered from the project \nareas, it is therefore necessary to ensure that the suppliers should be able to prove that \nconstruction materials are legally mined and gathered. To reduce the need for construction \nmaterial, excavated material from existing roads should be reused as much as possible.               \n \n9.  The environmental impact associated with project operation is mainly related to traffic \nsafety. Adequate traffic signs and physical barriers will be used to reduce motorists\u2019 speed. \nTraffic congestion is expected to be reduced, which should lead to improvement of air quality \ndue to reducing air pollution associated with inefficient car combustion. \n \n3.     Impact Due to Construction and Operation of Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) \n \n10.  The environmental impact of construction of ICD facilities in Kakarbhita will be limited to \nICD area. The impact of construction is mainly due to increased traffic in the project area to \ntransport construction materials and equipment, and to dust and noise due to construction and \ndemolition. Before demolition, buildings should be inspected to ensure that no asbestos needs \nto  be  disposed.  Otherwise,  consultation  will  be  carried  out  with  Ministry  of  People  and \nEnvironment (MOPE) to ensure that asbestos waste will be properly handled.  \n \n11.  Operation  impact  will  be  mainly  caused  by  the  increasing  number  of  slow-moving \nvehicles within the ICD which will increase air pollution due to low engine combustion. Special \ntraffic regulations will be implemented within the ICD, e.g., not allowing vehicles to park within \nthe  ICD  area  with  engines-on.  Trees  and  grass  will  be  planted  within  the ICD area. The \nwastewater needs to be properly treated before disposal into public water bodies such as \nstreams, rivers, or irrigation canals. This is because the wastewater from ICD will contain \ndrainage water from mineral storage area that may store dangerous goods, and from domestic \nwastes. The ICD needs also to develop simple solid waste management. Sub-power stations \nshould use only PCBs free transformers.      \n \nE.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n1.  Institutional Framework and Responsibility   \n \n12.  Implementing  mitigation  measures  for  construction  of  roads  and  ICD  will  be  the \ncontractor\u2019s  responsibility.  An  environmental  engineer,  who  will  be  hired  as  part  of  the \nconsultant team to implement the Project, will help the Ministry of Public Planning and Works, \nthe executing agency (EA), and Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board (NITDB) which \nis responsible for management of the ICD after construction, prepare a contract document, so \nthat the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations clearly identify \nenvironmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for  non-compliance.  The  EA  will  be \nresponsible for monitoring and supervising the implementation of all environmental mitigation \nmeasures for project roads and development of ICD infrastructure facilities, respectively. The \nEA and NITDB have no staff dedicated to environmental concerns, therefore, the Project will \nhelp  them  address  such  concerns  systematically.  Both  agencies  have  agreed  to  provide ", "56           Appendix 12 \ncounterpart  staff  to  work  closely  with  the  environment  specialist  who  will  be  part  of  the \nconsultant team to implement the Project. \n \n2.  Environmental Monitoring and Management Plan \n \n13.  The IEE has identified the generic monitoring and management program, which will help \nmitigate  adverse  project  impacts.  The  monitoring  during  project  construction  will  focus  on \nimplementation of mitigation measures to minimize pollution (dust, and gas from hot-mix plants); \nre-use top soil; stabilize the embankment to maintain the river flow and to avoid flooding. The \nmonitoring during the project operation will focus on air quality (SPM, SO, NOX, and HC) and \nwater quality (pH, TSS, BOD, COD, and oil and grease). The results will be compared to the \nbaseline data gathered during the IEE study.  \n \n14.   The Department of Road will implement the environmental monitoring and management \nplan  (EMP)  and  will  submit  an  annual  implementation  report  to  ADB  and  other  relevant \nGovernment agencies such as MOPE if necessary. The implementation report will be kept as a \nproject  document  and  disclosed  to  the  public  if  required.  NITDB  will  implement  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plan to develop ICD infrastructure facilities. The \nICD  will  submit  an  annual  implementation  report  of  the  EMP  to  ADB  and  other  relevant \nagencies, including MOPE. \n  \nF.  Public Consultations and Information Disclosure \n \n15.  During  the  IEE  preparation,  several  public  consultations,  particularly  with  local \ncommunities, were carried out. Community concerns about the Project are (i) quarrying in the \nrivers,  which  could  affect  people\u2019s  activities;  and  (ii)  inconvenient  living  conditions  due  to \nconstruction work. These concerns were considered in preparing mitigation measures and the \nEMP. Government agencies consulted during IEE preparation indicated their support for the \nproject. The Project was also featured in the local newspaper to disclose information and seek \npublic opinion on the IEE study. \n          \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n16.  The IEE study shows that project environmental impacts are insignificant and will mostly \noccur  during  construction.  All  impacts  can  be  mitigated,  and  the  mitigation  measures  are \nincorporated into project design and construction. There are no environmentally sensitive areas \ninvolved in the Project. Therefore, a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) to assess \nfurther impacts for roads under this Project is not required.  \n \nH.    Conclusion \n \n17.  The Project will improve existing roads and build ICD. The overall IEE finding is that the \nProject will not cause significant environmental problems and that potential adverse impacts are \nmanageable.  However, monitoring should be continuous. \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041115162554+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041015141300+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R199-04.doc", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "aj3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20041015061244"}}
