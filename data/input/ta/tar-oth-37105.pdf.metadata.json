The Regional technical assistance (TA) Screening Committee approved a Concept \nPaper for the TA on 10 November 2002. A Mission visited the Central Asian Republics (CARs) \nincluding  Kazakhstan,  Tajikistan,  Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan,  and  Kyrgyz  Republic  from  24 \nMarch to 18 April to undertake fact-finding for the proposed TA. The Mission carried out an \nassessment  of  earlier  ADB  and  other  donors\u2019  interventions  in  support  of  environmental \nmanagement  and  held  discussions  with  concerned  government  agencies,  NGOs,  regional \ninstitutions, and donor representatives and agreed on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nimplementation arrangements, and other details. See Appendix 1 for TA Framework.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Due to their common historical and cultural heritage, and biogeographic links, the CARs \nshare many natural resources and associated environmental problems. The five republics are \nall part of the Aral Sea basin (ASB), and are thus affected by the flow of the region\u2019s two major \nrivers, the Amudarya and the Syrdarya. These rivers play a key role in the well being of the \npeople and economic development, providing valuable water resources for drinking, agriculture, \nindustry, and household use, and maintenance of the ecological balance. Mismanagement of \nthe region\u2019s natural resources, especially land and water, had led to many of the collective \nenvironmental threats. Early in the 1960s, the rapid development of irrigated agriculture led to a \nsignificant increase in withdrawals from the Amudarya and Syrdarya rivers. As a result, the Aral \nSea has been shrinking at an alarming rate over the last thirty years, rendering the region one of \nthe most severely damaged ecological zones in the world. See Appendix 2 for an overview. \n3.  Key environmental problems include water pollution, air pollution, land degradation and \ndesertification, solid and hazardous waste disposal, mountain ecosystems degradation, and \nloss of biodiversity. Contamination of surface waters combined with poor access to drinking \nwater supplies has led to high rates of water-related illnesses. Areas with high levels of \nradioactive  contamination  have  revealed  extremely  high  rates  of  psychological  disorders, \nmalignant  tumors,  and  other  morphological  abnormalities.  Environmental  degradation  also \naffects economic development by reducing worker productivity, and productivity of natural \nresources, in particular agriculture. Moreover, given the transboundary roots and human health \nimplications of these problems, the consequences of continued environmental mismanagement \nis a potential source of tension and conflict among the countries of the region.  \n4.  During the pre-independence Soviet-era, the system of environmental monitoring and \nthe associated institutional set up was dictated by Soviet policies, which required measurements \nof indicators focused on irrigated agriculture, mainly cotton (hydrology \u2013 salinity, pH, silt levels in \ndrainage systems, and related meteorological parameters), and to a limited extent on sanitation. \nMoreover, as the Russian technicians left the region, institutions were left in limbo and even \nhydrological monitoring was compromised and limited to sporadic measurements due to severe \nbudgetary constraints and limitations of expertise. Environmental monitoring labs were left with \nlimited staff and technical resources that rendered comprehensive or regular measurements of \nall critical parameters difficult. In the changed context of economic development in the post-\nindependence  era,  there  is  a  need  for  indicators  that  are  relevant  to  sustainability  of \ndevelopment  and  have  direct  bearing  on  health  and  welfare  of  the  people.  Soviet  era \nenvironmental indicators became redundant  for measuring environmental impacts on human \nhealth and well being. Post independence, while some environmental management capacity \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 04 March 2003.  \n ", "2  \nhas been built with the support of donors, it is still limited and the monitoring laboratories \ncontinue to be drastically under-funded, lacking both modern equipment and such fundamental \nmaterials as reagents for water quality analysis. Due to capacity constraints, data collection and \nanalysis have yet to be computerized and are compiled manually on paper. Furthermore, the \nregional institutions are still grappling with standardized procedures and harmonized indicators. \nAll these shortcomings, and the resulting lack of relevant and comprehensive environmental \nindicators severely constrains effective environmental management and,  as a consequence, \nintra-national and regional collaboration on addressing environmental issues and impacts.  \n5.  Responding  to  these  constraints  to  sustainable  development,  several  donor \norganizations have assisted the CARs in developing the needed environmental management \ninfrastructure.  Key  donors  include  the  ADB,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment, European Union Technical Assistance for Commonwealth of Independent States \n(TACIS), global environmental facility (GEF), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), \nthe World Bank, and several bilateral agencies. In 1992, the Aral Sea Basin development \nprogram  under  the  banner\u2014the  International  Fund  for  Saving  the  Aral  Sea  (IFAS)\u2014was \nestablished to address the potential disaster resulting from a shrinking Aral Sea with the \nassistance of the World Bank, UNDP, and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). An \nExecutive Committee (EC-IFAS) was also established at the same time to coordinate regional \nand international donor efforts and related environmental issues. The Interstate Committee for \nSustainable Development (ICSD) under IFAS was given the mandate to ensure integration of \neconomic, social, and environmental factors. The recently developed ASBII Program recognizes \nthat irrational economic activities have led to breakdown of ecosystems, and consequently, \nenvironmental degradation in the region. Aral Sea Basin (ASB) II Program also recognizes that \nmonitoring is critical to effective environmental management, in itself handicapped as monitoring \ncenters lack modern analytical and communication equipment.  \n6.  Donor  assistance  since  independence,  while  strengthening  capacity,  resulted  in  (i) \nnational environmental action plans (NEAPs); (ii) national biodiversity action plans (NBAPs), \nand Agenda 21s of the Earth Summit; (iii) ratification of most international conventions and \nprotocols on environment; and (iv) national action plans (NAPs) to combat land degradation and \ndesertification under United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). Given the \ncommon objectives of these action plans, there is a need for their consolidation into a strategic \nprogram of implementation with a timeframe and budgetary commitments.  \n7.  The ongoing  water and environmental management project (WEMP), funded by GEF \nsince 2002, was initiated for implementing a Program of concrete actions for the improvement of \nthe environmental situation in the ASB approved on 11 January 1994 (Nukus). Its objectives are \nto develop national plans and regional strategy for rational use of water resources and salt \ncontrol in the region, taking into account economic, ecological, and socials tasks of the region\u2019s \nstates. Such projects would benefit from linkage to national environmental monitoring systems. \n8.  ADB\u2019s TA in environmental management, initiated in 1994, primarily targeted capacity \nbuilding in environmental monitoring and support to regional initiatives.2 In collaboration with \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1995.

Following up on REAP, UNEP is \ninitiating establishment of a decision support system (DSS), using SICs as the focal points. This \ninitiative would put in place the basic infrastructure for the DSS at the SICs with an operational \nphase that will support programs and projects for regional cooperation. The operational phase \nwill include developing a set of common indicators for the Central Asian Republics to facilitate \nenvironmental monitoring across the region and harmonization of environmental standards. \n9.  Consequent to ADB\u2019s interventions in capacity building, the capacity of environmental \nmanagement agencies has improved, as have environmental impact assessment procedures \nand  guidelines.  At  the  regional  level,  both  UNEP  and  UNDP  appear  poised  (with  GEF \nresources) to follow through on many of the actions identified during the REAP process. There \nalso has been good progress in creating the basic institutional framework for more systematic \nattention to the management of mountain ecosystems. The need for much more effective plans, \npolicies, and programs to address water and land management is another important recurring \ntheme in the region. Past experience has, however, revealed that for any interventions to be \nsuccessful and yield desired results, there is a need for in-country ownership and commitment, \ndemonstrated through provision of adequate budgetary support to ensure appropriate and \neffective level of environmental management. Future ADB assistance is programmed to build on \nthis foundation and the partnerships established to help develop the region\u2019s full potential by \nensuring protection of its environment and sustainability of its development. \n10.  Inadequacy of systematic and reliable environmental information due to national level \ncapacity constraints, and an inadequate understanding of the implications of environmental \nmismanagement  on  economic  development  by  stakeholders  are  primary  barriers  to \nsustainability  of  development.  Given  the  agro-ecological  linkages  and  socioeconomic \ndependencies  among  the  countries  in  the  region,  the  need  for  regional  cooperation  in \nenvironmental management as the means to sustainable development and social well being of \ntheir  peoples  is  paramount.  Success  of  regional  environmental  management  needs  an \ninstitutionalized  system  of  environmental  monitoring  at  the  national  level,  encompassing \nenvironmental  information  management  systems  (EIMS)  based  on  standard  procedures, \ncomparable standards and harmonized indicators across the region. Establishment of EIMS \nwould  provide  a  window  for  information  exchange  and  an  opportunity  for  dialogue  on \ntransboundary environmental issues, thereby providing a rationale for regional cooperation.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The  overall  goal  of  the  TA  will  be  to  help  achieve  sustainable  development  by \nmainstreaming environment into national development planning processes, and strengthening \nregional  cooperation  on  transboundary  environmental  management.  Building  on  past \nachievements and lessons learnt, and complementing the efforts of other donors such as UNEP \nand  UNDP,  the  purpose  of  the  TA  is  to  enhance  regional  cooperation  in  addressing \ntransboundary  environmental  issues  by  strengthening  national  environmental  management \ncapacities with specific reference to  (i) environmental information and knowledge management; \n(ii)  harmonized  environmental  standards  across  the  region  against  the  most  critical \nenvironmental indicators (such as air, water, hazardous waste, land degradation); and (iii) a \n                                                                                                                                                             \nAssistance to Tajikistan for Capacity Building for Environmental Assessment and Monitoring.

The outputs include (i) a transparent and accessible EIMS in each participating CAR \nlinked  to  SIC  of  ICSD  to  ensure  systematic  environmental  monitoring;  (ii)  environmental \nstandards, harmonized across CARs against the most critical environmental indicators; and (iii) \na consolidated strategic program of implementation of all the existing environment-related action \nplans with national ownership and realistic budgetary commitments. The TA scope will extend to \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and to a limited extent to Uzbekistan.3  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The activities include (i) a needs assessment to scrutinize and sequence the elements \nfor strengthening (a) the existing national EIMS (including hardware and software) and (b) the \ncapacity of concerned institutions for effective environmental management; (ii) an evaluation of \ncurrent practices, procedures and standards as a basis for (a) an agreement among the \ncountries  in  the  region  on  a  set  of  environmental  indicators,  and  (b)  harmonization  of \nenvironmental standards and procedures across CARs; (iii) consolidation of all environment-\nrelated  action  plans  to  develop  an  implementation  program  with  realistic  budgetary \ncommitments, financing options and appropriate institutional arrangements (iv) strengthening \nregional cooperation through institutionalized links and synergies between national and regional \nprograms and institutions; (v) providing a forum for regional seminars, workshops and summit \nmeetings for discussion and resolution of transboundary environmental issues and a venue for \ndissemination; and (vi) providing modern facilities and equipment.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent, consisting of $800,000 in foreign \nexchange cost and $200,000 in local currency cost. The Government of Finland will provide \n$800,000 equivalent on a grant basis to be administered by ADB, to cover all of the foreign \nexchange costs through the channel financing agreement with ADB. The Governments of CARs \nwill finance $160,000 as direct budgetary support for procurement of materials and equipment \nand $40,000 in-kind contribution covering such expenses as remuneration, domestic travel of \ncounterpart staff, office space and other maintenance operations and activities. Cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency. Within ADB, the Agriculture, Environment, and \nNatural Resources Division of ECRD will administer and supervise the TA. Implementation of \nvarious components will be undertaken concurrently in each participating country, and will be \nled by national environment management agencies or ministries, as implementing agencies \n(IAs), with the head of the agency as the focal point. The IAs will be responsible for day-to-day \noperations  to  ensure  smooth  implementation,  close  coordination  of  activities  with  national \nfinance and economic planning agencies, regional institutions such as EC-IFAS, ICSD, and \nvarious development partners, in particular UNEP, UNDP, and TACIS. \n                                                 \n3  Uzbekistan\u2019s involvement would be limited to participation in regional seminars, workshops, and meetings to \ndiscuss transboundary environmental issues. Since Uzbekistan is developing a unified environmental monitoring \nnetwork (across sectors) on its own under the State Committee for Nature Protection, sharing of information and \nexperience would benefit all participating countries. \n ", "                          5\n16.  Implementation of the TA will require 15 person-months of international and 192 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. Three international experts will be recruited with expertise in (i) \nenvironmental  management  for  9  person-months  (team  leader);  (ii)  EIMS  and  geographic \ninformation systems for 3 person-months; and (iii) environmental analysis and monitoring for 3 \nperson-months. Preference will be given to candidates for international consultants who have \nprior experience in any of the participating countries and/or Russian language capability. Team \nLeader\u2019s services will be staggered over a 24 month period during which implementation will be \ncompleted.  A  domestic  Environmental  Management  expert,  also  acting  as  Deputy  Team \nLeader, will lead domestic expert teams in each participating country. He/she will be assisted by \nan  EIMS  and  Information  technology  (hardware  and  software)  expert,  and  an  Analytical \nLaboratories\u2019 Development and Operations expert, each for a period of 12 person-months, in \neach CAR. The domestic team leader, in addition to his technical responsibilities, will be \nresponsible for liaison with the national focal points, government agencies, regional institutions \nsuch as ICSD, and donor organizations, and submit regular monthly reports on project progress, \nproblems, and constraints to the international team leader (and ADB in the absence of Team \nLeader). \n17.  Given the specialized nature of services required, including prior CARs experience and \nRussian language capability, international consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements for the selection of domestic \nconsultants,  using  simplified  technical  proposals  and  quality  based  selection  procedures. \nIndividual domestic consultants will be engaged by ADB in consultation with the team leader. \nDetailed terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n18.  A regional workshop will be held at Dushanbe, with participation of all national focal \npoints, national economic planning and finance ministries, EC-IFAS  and  ICSD,  concerned \ndonors, regional and national NGO representatives to deliberate and agree on an Inception \nReport  (IR)  and  a  work  program.  Four  months,  12  months,  and  18  months  after \ncommencement,  second,  third  (first  mid-term)  and  fourth  (second  mid-term)  reports, \nrespectively, will be presented at regional workshops that will be held at agreed locations within \nthe region. The reports will provide an update on progress and achievements, a work program \nfor the remaining period of implementation, and an updated framework. The draft final report will \ndetail outcome of the TA and demonstrate how the outcome responds to achievement of \nobjectives. Exact timing for the submission of first mid-term, second midterm, and draft final \nreports, as well as various seminars and workshops, would be indicated in the work program \npresented in the IR. Additional regional workshops and/or Ministerial level meetings will be held \nin consultation with EC-IFAS and ICSD at Almaty, Ashagabat, Dushanbe, or other agreed \nlocations, where case studies and other issues of regional significance would be discussed and \nconclusions and recommendations adopted. Options will be explored to hold a regional summit \nand sign agreements to address transboundary environmental issues. The final report will be \nsubmitted  two  weeks  after  its  presentation,  incorporating  comments  made  by  various \nstakeholders. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $800,000  to  the \nGovernments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland for Capacity Building in Environmental \nInformation Management Systems in Central Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nREGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n CAPACITY BUILDING IN ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS IN \nCENTRAL ASIA \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions and \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  Risks \nGoal:       \n       \n\u2022  To help achieve  By the year 2020:  \u2022  Regular monitoring  \u2022  Policy makers and \nsustainable  \u2022  Participating countries have  of environmental  development \ndevelopment by  uniform standards across  information at  planners\u2019 \nintegrating  Central Asian Republics  strategic locations  willingness to \nenvironment into  (CARs) for the most critical  by national  mainstream \nnational  environmental parameters,  institutions, using  environmental \ndevelopment  using appropriate indicators  international  management in the \nplanning  for water, air, hazardous  standards and an  development \nprocesses and  waste, and land  acceptable set of  planning processes \nfacilitating  degradation, harmonized  indicators \nregional  across the region  harmonized across \ncooperation on    the region  \ntransboundary    \u2022  National  \u2022  Policy makers and \nenvironmental    Development  planners are aware \nmanagement      Strategies and  of the implications \n  Plans (include  of environment on \n  environmental  the development \n  management as a  processes. \n  part of the   \n  development \n  process) \n  \u2022  Information  \u2022  Capacity of national \nexchange and  environmental \n\u2022  Levels of air pollutants  dialogue at the  management \n(CO2, particulates ( PM10,  regional level  institutions \nPM2.5, SPM), SO2, NO2,  under the auspices  improved and \nO3 and lead and BOD,  of Interstate  brought to \nCOD and heavy metals in  Sustainable  international \nthe main rivers (Syrdaria  Development  standards.  \nand its main tributaries  Commission   \nNaryn and Karadaria rivers;

Introduction \n1.  The  extent  of  environmental  degradation  in  Central  Asia  is  substantial.  Key \nenvironmental  problems  include  water  pollution,  air  pollution,  land  degradation  and \ndesertification, solid and hazardous waste disposal, mountain ecosystems degradation, and \nloss of biodiversity. These problems are closely inter-related.  \n2.  Water  pollution\u2014from  chemical,  biological,  physical  and  radioactive  pollutants\u2014is \nperhaps the most common and widely addressed environmental concern throughout the region. \nChemical pollution includes high concentrations of sulfates, chlorides, sodium ions, pesticides, \nnitrogen compounds and phosphates; primarily due to the excessive use of pesticides and \nfertilizers in agriculture. The main sources of water pollution and contamination are untreated \nagricultural, industrial and municipal wastewaters. Other sources include soil erosion (due to \ndeforestation and inappropriate agricultural/irrigation practices), mining operations, weapons \nproduction and testing, and toxic/radioactive dumping. The inefficient use of water resources for \nagriculture has also contributed significantly to water scarcity and contamination. \n3.  Land degradation and desertification are a growing problem across the region. Because \nof water shortages resulting from the arid climate and excessive water use, lands are becoming \ndrier and less able to support plant and animal communities. There are four major components \nof land degradation: soil erosion and nutrient depletion; soil contamination and salinization; \ndeforestation; and desertification. Soil erosion impacts majority of agricultural land in each of the \nCentral  Asian  Republics  (CARs),  and  intense  salinization  affects  about  half  of  irrigated \ncroplands in both Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Deforestation, driven primarily by fuelwood \nharvesting among rural populations, has major impacts on soil erosion too, especially in the \nmountainous areas of the upper Aral Sea Watershed (i.e., Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic), \nwhich have lost nearly half of their original forest cover. Desert and riparian forests have also \nbeen reduced drastically. Extreme soil degradation has led to desertification, rendering more \nland unsuitable for agriculture. Human activities exacerbate natural land degradation processes. \n4.  Air pollution levels in the CARs are on the rise again, after an initial drop in early 1990s, \ndue to the re-opening of manufacturing facilities and the increase in emissions from non-\nstationary sources. Kazakhstan accounts for nearly half of total airborne pollutants in the region \n(43.7%), with 75% from stationary sources (mainly industries and energy production facilities). \nUzbekistan  and  Turkmenistan  follow,  emitting  31.4%  and  19.9%  of  airborne  pollutants, \nrespectively. The combined contribution of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic is only about 5%. \nMain pollutants are sulfur dioxide, suspended solids, carbonic oxide and hydrocarbons. In 1999, \nten cities in Kazakhstan, and one in Uzbekistan, registered high levels of air pollution (i.e., \natmospheric  pollution  index  >  7)  with  significant  transboundary  implications.  In  2001,  the \nproportion of fallout of sulfur dioxides and nitrogen oxides from Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz \nRepublic on their neighboring CARs were 7% and 58%, respectively.  \n5.  Solid and hazardous waste disposal is a burgeoning problem in the region. The amount \nof municipal solid waste continues to grow annually, with 13 million tons accumulated during \n1999  alone.  Excess  quantities  of  solid  waste  combined  with  insufficient  municipal  waste \nmanagement and recycling programs create an environmental health risk for populations living \nnear waste dumps. Industrial waste consists of both solid and hazardous materials. However, a \nmajority is comprised of toxic and radioactive substances. During 1999, The CARs produced \nover  168  million  tons  of  industrial  waste;  over  ten  times  the  amount  of  municipal  waste \n ", "1 0  Appendix 2 \n(Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic accounted for 83%). Principal sources of hazardous \nwaste include the mining, military and energy sectors. \n6.  Mountain  ecosystems  degradation  in  the  region  is  the  result  of  several  of  the \nenvironmental problems discussed above, including water and air pollution, land degradation, \nand hazardous waste disposal. Major threats include deforestation and degradation of pasture \nareas. These impacts, along with unsustainable agricultural practices, contribute to soil erosion \non  steep  hillsides.  Mining  devastates  mountain  landscapes  and  pollutes  rivers  with  toxic \nchemicals  used  for  processing  ores.  Mountain  ecosystems  are  also  impacted  by  road \nconstruction,  hydropower  development,  industrialization,  uncontrolled  tourism,  and  illegal \nhunting and foraging.  \n7.  The region encompassing the CARs, with its wide variety of ecosystems\u2014from alpine \nsnows  to  temperate  forests,  arid  deserts,  riparian  wetlands,  and  marine  environments\u2014 \nsupports a substantial diversity of plant and animal species. However, pervasive environmental \ndegradation (in the form of those environmental problems mentioned above) threatens species \nin nearly all of these ecosystems. \nB.  Implications of Environmental Problems for Human Health, Poverty, Economic \nDevelopment, Peace and Security \n8.  The environmental issues described above have significant adverse impacts on human \nhealth, poverty, economic development, peace and security throughout the region. Health \nimpacts result from water and air pollution, toxic and radioactive wastes, and soil degradation. \nRespiratory diseases are common in a few heavily polluted industrial zones, and around the \nAral Sea where contaminated dusts blow. The contamination of surface waters combined with \npoor access to drinking water supplies have led to high incidences of water-borne diseases \nincluding anemia and intestinal diseases. Overall, contaminated water is the source of about \n80% of diseases in the region, including typhoid, dysentery, diphtheria and viral hepatitis. Areas \nwith high levels of radioactive contamination have revealed elevated rates of psychological \ndisorders, malignant tumors, and morphological abnormalities. Environmental degradation also \nhas negative implications for poverty and economic development. The poor typically live closer \nto contaminated air and water, leading to a higher incidence of illnesses and unemployment. \nDegradation of natural resources also impacts the rural poor whose livelihood depends directly \non  them.  Environmental  degradation  affects  economic  development  by  reducing  labor \navailability and worker productivity (due to poorer health), creating environmental mitigation \ncosts,  reducing  agricultural  productivity,  and  decreasing  tourism.  It  is  estimated that soil \nsalinization  and  land  degradation  have  decreased  agricultural  yields  by  20\u2013-30  percent \nregionally, reducing GNP by about five percent. The annual fish catch has also declined by \nnearly 60% in the last decade. Furthermore, competition over water resources, transboundary \nchemical  and  radioactive  pollution  (via  water  and  air),  decaying  water  management \ninfrastructure and natural disasters (such as the potential for the bursting of the natural dam \nholding  Lake  Sarez  in  Tajikistan),  and  unguarded  and  poorly  contained  hazardous  waste \nmaterials pose a real threat to peace and security in the region. \nC.  Capacity of the CARs for addressing Environmental Issues \n9.  The national capacities of the CARs to deal with the environmental problems outlined \nabove varies considerably, depending on their legal/policy framework, institutional effectiveness, \nengagement of civil society, equipment and expertise, and financial commitments, as discussed \nbelow:  \n ", "   Appendix 2  11\n1.  Legal/Policy Base and Enforcement \n10.  With the assistance of various donors, each of the CARs has developed legislation to \naddress environmental problems in their country; signed agreements with their neighboring \ncountries to concur on specific transboundary environmental issues; and joined international \nenvironmental conventions and protocols under the United Nations Framework. According to a \nmajority of the stakeholders in the region, the commitments inherent in these laws, agreements \nand  conventions  are  adequate  to  ensure  the  protection  and  rational  management  of \nenvironmental and natural resources. The problem, they say, is in their implementation. In \naddition to legal mechanisms, the CARs have each developed a set of environmental strategies: \nNational Environmental Action Plans (NEAPs), National Action Plans to Combat Desertification, \nNational Strategies and Action Plans for Sustainable Mountain Area Development, national \nbiodiversity strategies, and Agenda 21 (i.e., sustainable development) implementation plans. \nThis patchwork of policy mandates complicates implementation of each by simultaneously \nsupporting parallel and competing institutions and processes. Moreover, development of these \nstrategies was driven largely by donor organizations, so it does not necessarily reflect true \nnational priorities or enjoy the full political support of their governments. Other policy initiatives, \nsuch as the extension of protected areas or decisions to unify national monitoring systems, \nrepresent positive steps, but also suffer from implementation issues. National policies and \nprocesses  for  mainstreaming  environment  in  economic  development  planning  also  require \nstrengthening. \n2.  National and Regional Institutions \n11.  Implementation of the legal and policy commitments mentioned above depends on \nnational  and  regional  institutional  capacities.  The  key  institutions  for  environmental  policy \nformulation at the national level are the Ministries/State Committees of Environmental/Nature \nProtection, charged  with regulation of pollution, management of protected areas, and other \nresponsibilities. Despite their cabinet-level status, these organizations are situated rather low in \nthe government pecking order, lacking both political weight and financial resources. Thus, they \nare  not  equipped  with  adequate  resources  or  authority  to  fully  carry  out  their  various \nresponsibilities. There are other national-level organizations responsible for different aspects of \nenvironmental  management,  including  the  hydrometeorological  services  (Hydromet),  land \nmanagement  committees,  forest  services,  and  various  research  institutions.  Coordination \namong these agencies is compromised by competition over mandates and meager budgets.  \n12.  Among  the  regional  institutions  concerned  with  environmental  issues,  the  most \nprominent is the Interstate Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS). IFAS was founded by the five \nCAR Presidents in 1992 to coordinate regional and international donor efforts for addressing the \nAral Sea crisis and related environmental issues. IFAS\u2019 mandate has since grown to include \nsetting regional policy and promoting intersectoral coordination for sustainable development. \nThere has also been a proposal to create a new UN Commission on the Aral Sea Basin (ASB). \nIFAS  comprises  an  Executive  Committee  (EC-IFAS),  an  Interstate  Commission  for  Water \nCoordination (ICWC) Ministers of Water Resources Management, an Interstate Commission on \nSustainable Development (ICSD) and Chairs/Ministers of Nature Protection/Environment and \nMinisters of Finance/Economy. IFAS has lost much of its former eminence, due to political \ninfighting among member countries and frequent relocation of its offices. ICWC has retained its \nimportance due to its foundation on well-established regional water management institutions in \nTashkent, and the fact that transboundary water allocation remains a salient issue for all of the \nCARs. The ICSD does not enjoy the same level of political or financial support from IFAS or the \nnational governments. ICWC and ICSD both have subordinate Scientific Information Centers \n ", "1 2  Appendix 2 \n(SICs). ICWC-SIC (located in Tashkent) enjoys strong coordination among national branch \noffices, is provided with ample support from IFAS and the CAR governments, and serves as the \nsecretariat  for  ICWC.  In  contrast,  ICSD-SIC,  which  is  charged  with  coordinating  regional \ninformation exchange, lacks cooperation among its country branch offices, and plays a limited \nrole in the affairs of ICSD. Other organizations involved in regional environmental issues include \nthe Central Asian Mountain Information Network, the Central Asian Regional Environmental \nCenter, and the Central Asian Hydrometeorological Scientific Research Institute. Despite its \nlimitations, most donors are of the opinion that EC-IFAS is the only organization that has the \nmandate and the only forum for the concerned countries to debate, discuss, and in many \ninstances resolve regional issues.  \n3.  Awareness and Engagement of Civil Society \n13.  Environmental  NGOs  play  an  integral  role  in  influencing  environmental  policy  and \nmanagement  in  the  region  by:  (i)  participating  in  decision-making  processes,  and  holding \ngovernments, industries, and donor organizations accountable for their decisions and actions; \n(ii) educating and informing the public about environmental issues and transgressions; and (iii) \ncoordinating local-level projects for the prevention and/or mitigation of environmental problems. \nNGOs have begun to participate in the policy dialogue with increasing frequency and status, \nenjoying  membership  on  governmental  and  inter-governmental  committees.  They  are  also \nbuilding  strong  coalitions  and  conducting  effective  advocacy  campaigns  around  specific \nenvironmental  causes,  while  working  to  involve  the  public  more  directly  in  environmental \ndecision-making  by  pressing  for  public  hearings  on  government  decisions  or  economic \ndevelopment plans. Direct relationship with local communities also makes NGOs more efficient \nand effective in carrying out specific environmental protection, management, and mitigation \nprojects. Despite their proven record in addressing environmental problems, lack of government \nsupport  and  acknowledgement  of  NGOs  remains  a  significant  barrier  to  increasing  the \nmagnitude and scope of their impacts.  \n4.  Technical Assets and Capacity \n14.  Throughout the region, environmental management agencies lack adequate equipment \nand  expertise  for  collecting,  archiving,  analyzing,  and  dispersing  environmental  data. \nEnvironmental monitoring labs (for measuring water and air pollution and soil contamination) are \nspread across multiple institutions with little collaboration among them. None of them have \nsufficient staff or technical resources to make comprehensive or regular measurements of all \ncritical parameters, precluding the development of reliable environmental indicators necessary \nfor effective environmental management. The present situation with national environmental \ninformation networks (which rely largely on monitoring data) is similar, with databases spread \nthroughout various institutions and infrequent information sharing. Uzbekistan has initiated \nefforts to consolidate its monitoring and information systems within their main environmental \nagencies, with direct institutional links to other relevant institutions. Current efforts to promote \nregional information exchange will not be effective without standardized indicators and strong \nnational information management systems for them to draw upon.  \n5.  Financial Resources \n15.  Inadequacy of financial resources is one of the most frequently cited reasons for the \ninability  of  governments  and  civil  society  organizations  to  effectively  address  urgent \nenvironmental issues. While it is true that current national budget allocations for environmental \nprograms and activities are inadequate to address the magnitude of the problems, it is also \n ", "   Appendix 2  13\napparent that the lack of funding has as much to do with misplaced priorities as with meager \nfinancial  resources.  Moreover,  the  CARs  rarely  include  budgetary  considerations  in  their \nnational environmental initiatives and programs. Consequently, national environmental agencies \nmust seek donor support to implement them. The CAR governments have contributed very little \nfunding to regional environmental initiatives and institutions like Regional Environmental Action \nPlan, Aral Sea Basin Program II, or IFAS. \nD.  Donor Assistance for Enhancing and Mainstreaming Environmental Management \n16.  International donor organizations have funded environmental management, economic \ndevelopment and social sector projects in the CARs since the early 1990s. Key donors include \nthe Asian Development Bank, World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction Development, \nEuropean Union, global environmental facility (GEF), UNDP, and several bilateral agencies. The \nWorld Bank environmental program emphasizes irrigation drainage improvement, water supply \nand sanitation as well as related institutional and policy supports. Its nonlending services \nprovide support for studies on river basin management and fisheries. EBRD\u2019s program focuses \non industrial pollution control and municipal waste management. The EU is involved in Aral Sea \nprogram. GEF provides supports in wetland and biodiversity protection of Aral Sea and Caspian \nSea as well as in water and environmental management. Overall, the focus of international \ndevelopment assistance has been the problems of the water management issues of the Aral \nSea region, emphasizing technical solutions to water allocation and conservation.  \n17.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s technical assistance (TA) in environmental management, \ninitiated in 1994, has targeted capacity building, selected environmental or natural resources \nmanagement  problems  and  regional  cooperation.1  Regionally,  ADB  has  made  significant \ncontributions  to  the  development  of  a  Regional  Environmental  Action  Plan  (REAP)  under \nimplementation  in  collaboration  with  UNEP.  The  Project  has  resulted  in  a  regional \nenvironmental action plan and development of environmental information infrastructure at the \nregional SIC at Ashagabat. The lessons learned from implementing these TAs point to the fact \nthat while some headway has been made in providing the basic infrastructure and capacity of \nenvironmental monitoring, the magnitude of problem and its complexity demands concerted \nefforts and significant level of investments, both through TAs and as parts of investment projects \nto  bring  the  concerned  institutions  to  a  level  of  effective  environmental  management. \nExperience has also revealed that there is a need for in-country ownership and commitment, not \nonly from the concerned institutions but also from the resource rich ministries (planning and \nfinance) to ensure compliance with environmental policies and regulations. Adequate budgetary \nsupport would be a prerequisite to ensure appropriate and effective level of environmental \nmanagement. \n18.  The main focus of UNDP\u2019s activities in CARs is capacity building in environmental \nmanagement with a view to strengthen environment governance and promote sustainable \ndevelopment. Support for environmental activities includes institutional strengthening for better \nenvironmental administration, capacity building within government and civil society institutions, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

With \nGEF support, UNDP assists in areas that include biodiversity conservation, climate change, \nozone-depleting substances, and persistent organic pollutants. The GEF Small Grants Program \nin Kazakhstan and Kyrgyz Republic provides assistance to NGOs at the grassroots level to \ntackle environmental issues relating to GEF focal areas. On the regional and sub-regional front, \nUNDP assists governments to participate in regional initiatives with the aim of promoting \ncooperation to address transboundary environmental issues.  \n19.  The  UNDP  Regional  ASB  Capacity  Building  project  has  played  a  key  role  in  the \nestablishment and promotion of regional cooperation under the IFAS/ICSD umbrella. Despite \nthe support from this project, a review made by UNDP at end of the project pointed to a lack of \ncoordination  of  donor  activities,  making  it  difficult  to  ensure  consistency  from  a  regional \nperspective by intergovernmental bodies in the Aral Sea region. The review emphasized that \ntechnical work completed under the donor-financed initiatives does not reach decision-makers. \n20.  Following up on REAP and possible funding from GEF, UNEP is contemplating an \ninitiative to establish a decision support system (DSS) with the Scientific Information Centers \n(SICs) as the main focus. The objective would be to establish a DSS for the CARs to support \nprograms and activities of regional cooperation on environment protection and sustainable \ndevelopment. This initiative would put in place the basic infrastructure for the DSS and would be \ncompleted in a year. An operation phase for actual implementation of the database to support \nthe programs and projects on the regional cooperation is proposed after the establishment \nphase. UNEP\u2019s initiative would complement the national level EIMS proposed under the RETA.  \n21.  The Aral Sea Basin II Program recognizes that irrational economic activity in the ASB \nhas led to extensive breakdown of ecosystems, and consequently, the extent of environmental \ndegradation in the region is substantial. ASBII Program has also recognized that environmental \nis monitoring critical to effective environmental management and it is handicapped on account \nof  ill-equipped  hydro-meteorological  centers  and  outdated  analytical  and  communication \nequipment. There has also been a reduction in the number of hydrometeorological stations and \nposts as well as the number of observations. The Dushanbe\u2019s meeting of State Leaders, while \ndiscussing the ASBII Program, provided the main directions and approved concrete actions on \nimprovement of environment for the period of 2003\u20132010.These actions, among other things, \ninclude improvement of environment monitoring systems for more complete data collection and \neffective use of such data in addressing water-related environmental problems. \n22.  The water and environmental management project (WEMP) also funded by GEF was \ninitiated in 2002 for purposes of implementing program of concrete actions for the improvement \nof the environmental situation in the ASB as approved by Heads of the CARs on 11 January \n1994 (Nukus). The objectives of the project are to develop national plans and regional strategy \nfor rational use of water resources and salt control in the region, taking into account economic, \necological, and socials tasks of the region\u2019s states given its limited water resources. Obviously, \nthe project focuses on addressing issues related to quantitative aspects of water in the region \nas the means to address potential environmental problems, primarily related to salt. Given the \nsignificance of WEMP in addressing the long-term environmental management issues resulting \nfrom irrational water abstraction, water quality related environmental information would help \ndraw  the  attention  of  concerned  regional  (such  as  EC-IFAS,  ICWC, ICSD) and national \ninstitutions (concerned ministries of water, environment, nature protection) in prioritizing actions \naimed at addressing such issues. Given its link to the dams in the region, which require urgent \nmeasures to increase their safety, EC-IFAS in its ASBII Program has reiterated the need for \npilot projects on restoration and modernization of dams within the framework of WEMP.  \n ", "   Appendix 2  15\n23.  The success of donor efforts can be seen in their contributions (at the national and \nregional  levels)  to  legal  and  policy  milestones  for  addressing  environmental  problems, \ninstitutional capacity building or environmental management institutions, increasing involvement \nof  civil  society  in  the  environmental  policy  process,  improving  the  technical  base  of \nenvironmental  agencies,  and  securing  government  funding  of  important  environmental \ninitiatives. Stakeholders from across the CARs have, however, noted some shortcomings of \ninternational donor assistance: a lack of national ownership and institutional and financial \nsustainability of environmental programs; poor donor collaboration leading to duplication and \ncompetition among programs; ineffectiveness of regional cooperation initiatives that emphasize \ndonors priorities over common national priorities; a lack of transparency, accountability and \neffectiveness among donor supported programs; and a narrow sectoral focus.  \n24.  Experience from past interventions indicates that \u201cownership\u201d is key to the success of \nassistance  and  that  success  of  projects  addressing  environmental  and  natural  resources \nmanagement  requires  a  program-based  approach,  not  a  project-based  one.  For  technical \nassistance to have a lasting effect, identification of priorities and design must be guided by a \nprogram framework and a strategic vision and be supported by a genuine sense of partnership. \nA reorientation of ADB\u2019s approaches for environmental assistance is therefore required to \nrespond  to  the  needs  of  mainstreaming  sustainable  development  with  a  program-based \napproach. This may involve addressing both capacity and policy constraints in mainstreaming \nenvironment in development planning, and enhancing awareness of the civil society through \nenhanced access to environmental information may be key to ensuring greater government \ncommitment to such policies and strategies.  \nE.  Constraints and Opportunities in Effective Environmental Management  \n25.  The preceding review of capacities and efforts to address the region\u2019s most pressing \nenvironmental issues has revealed constraints to effective environmental management and \nopportunities to address them, as discussed below: \n(i)  Legislative  and  Policy  Constraints  include  (a)  lack  of  integration  among \nnational  environmental  strategies,  (b)  insufficient  legal  mandate  and  policy \nmechanisms for mainstreaming environment in economic development planning, \n(c) lack of common membership by all CARs in international conventions on \nimportant transboundary environmental issues, (d) vague and repetitive action \nplans and initiatives without mutual coordination; and (e) lack of a legal mandate \nfor information-sharing at the regional level. \n(ii)  Institutional Constraints are (a) lack of understanding and information about \nthe severity and impacts of environmental problems, (b) weak political will and \ninfluence  of  environmental  agencies  in  the  national  policy  arena;  lack  of \nincentives  to  enforce  environmental  laws  and  implement  agreements;  (c) \ninadequate  collaboration  and  duplication  among  national  ministries  and \nagencies;  (d)  lack  of  involvement  and  empowerment  of  civil  society  in  the \nenvironmental policy process; (e) poor collaboration among NGOs at national \nand  regional  levels;  (f)  failure  of  the  CAR  governments  to  support  regional \nenvironmental initiatives and institutions; duplication and lack of coordination \namong  national  and  regional  information  management  initiatives;  and  (g) \nfrequent rotation of regional organizations and turnover of environmental officials.  \n(iii)  Technical  Constraints  include  (a)  outdated  and  scattered  environmental \nmonitoring systems and equipment, (b) lack of unified information management \n ", "1 6  Appendix 2 \nsystems at the national level, (c) poor electronic communications infrastructure, \nand (d) lack of common environmental indicators and standards. \n(iv)  Financial Constraints include (a) inadequate budgets for implementing national \nenvironmental programs, (b) excessive reliance on donor funding and lack of \nefforts  to  build  financial-sufficiency,  and  (c)  lack  of  government  funding  for \nregional institutions and initiatives. \n(v)  Donor-Related  Constraints  are  (a)  top-down  programming  and  lack  of \nownership of environmental agenda by the CAR governments and civil society, \n(b)  inflexible  donor  regulations  and  procedures,  (c)  excessive  reliance  on \ninternational  experts  and  government  officials,  (d)  lack  of  transparency  and \nmonitoring of donor projects, (e) insufficient funding for water quality and non-\nwater-related environmental issues, and (f) lack of donor coordination. \n26.  Opportunities to address the aforementioned constraints include: \n(i)  Building  national  monitoring  and  information  management  capacities \nthrough (a) consolidating national environmental monitoring systems, (b) building \nnational monitoring capacity, (e) consolidating national information management \nsystems,  (d)  building  national  capacities  for  environmental  information \nmanagement and distribution, (e) supporting NGOs efforts to provide information \non  environmental  laws,  agreements,  and  conventions,  (f)  enhancing  public \naccess via the internet to environmental information, (g) enhancing coordination \nbetween  national  and  regional  information  management  centers,  and  (h) \nencouraging development of a regional agreement on information sharing. \n(ii)  Mainstreaming environment in development among the CARs through (a) \nmandatory  requirements  and  mechanisms  for  mainstreaming  environment  in \nADB loan projects, (b) integrating environmentally sound technologies into ADB\u2019s \neconomic  development  programs,  and  (c)  promoting  national  and  regional \nmechanisms and forums for mainstreaming environment. \n(iii)  Facilitating  consolidation  of  national  action  plans  related  to  the \nenvironment  through  concerted  efforts  to  develop  a  time  table  for \nimplementation with  time-bound actions supported by ownership, commitment \nand adequate internal financial resources, which are supplemented by donors. \n(iv)  Enhancing civil society involvement in environmental management by (a) \ndevolving environmental projects to local institutions and communities, and (b) \nincreasing involvement of NGOs and citizens in environmental programs and \ndecision-making. \n(v)  Promoting national and regional ownership of environmental management \nagenda  by  (a)  establishing  co-financing  requirements,  (b)  channeling \nenvironmental  grant  programs  through  ICSD  or  EC-IFAS  to  enhance  their \nownership and capacity for regional initiatives, and (c) increasing involvement of \nlocal experts in environmental management projects. \n(vi)  Facilitating  regional  cooperation  through  institutional  partnerships  and \nexchanges  by  (a)  supporting  joint  initiatives  for  addressing  specific \ntransboundary  environmental  issues,  and  (b)  promoting  collaboration  and \nexchanges of experts among the CARs. \n \n ", "            Appendix 3        17  \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.
