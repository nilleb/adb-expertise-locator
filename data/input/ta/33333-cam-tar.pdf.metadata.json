INTRODUCTION\n1.  The statisticals ystem in Cambodiai s still at an ear1ys tage of development. In 1992, a\nBank fact-finding mission found a barely functioning statistical service in the Departmento  f\nStatistics of the Ministry of Planning( MOP). The statisticsc omponento f the Bank's technical\nassistance( TA) for strengtheningm  acroeconomicm anagementw1 as launched in 1993 to meet\nshort-tenT1n eeds for data and to start the 10ng-tenTre1b uildingo f the statistical system. The\nDepartmento f Statisticsw  as upgradedt o directorateg eneral level and renamed the National\nInstitute of Statistics (NIS). office buildings were renovated,c omputer equipment and office\nfacilitiesw  ere procured,c onsultantsw  ere provided,s tatisticalt rainingw  as especiallys upported,\nand sample surveysw  ere undertaken.\n2.  The  TA  was  completed  in  1995  and  was  followed  by  TA  for  statistical  system\ndevelopmenr  which  was  completed  in the first  half of  1999.  The  second  TA  supported  more\nsurveys  that expanded  and improved  the capability for regular  updating  of the national  statistical\ndatabase.  More  Cambodians  were trained  locally and abroad  through  a combination  of on-the-\njob  training,  apprenticeship,  and formal  schooling  up to the  master's  level  in applied  statistics.\nThe T A also  supported  the passage  of two subdecrees  that led to the reorganization  and official\nrecognition  of  the  role  of  NIS  as the  country's  central  statistical  agency.  A  summary  of  the\naccomplishments  of these two TAs is given in Appendix  1.\n3.  Statistical system development is a long-term process, especially in Cambodia where\nthe statistics cadre was almost completely annihilated and the statistical database either lost or\nrendered irrelevant by events from the mid-1970s. Hence, the Bank responded positively to a\nrequest for continued assistance to support the development of the statistical system.  The\nJanuary 1999 Bank Fact-Finding Mission discussed with the Government the objectives, scope,\nand implementation arrangements of a third TA  .3\nII. BACKGROUND AND RA\"\n4.  The  successful  implementation  of  other  survey-based  projeds,  such  as  the  1998\nCensus  of  Population  and  Housing  supported  by  the  United  Nations  Fund  for  Population\nActivities  and  the  project  on poverty  monitoring  and analysis  supported  by the  United  Nations\nDevelopment  Programme-World  Bank,  owed  much  to the  statistical  capacity  built  through  the\nBank's  two TAs. The success  of the Bank's assistance  can also be gauged  by the fact that most\navailable  socioeconomic  statistics  on Cambodia  cite NIS and the Bank's two T As as sources.\n5.  The Mission found that NIS needs more TA   to continue performing its mandate and\nensure that the capacity built will endure. Until the Government'sf iscal position improves,N  IS\nwill require financial assistance to continue updating the statistical database required for\nplanninga  nd decision making.T  he NIS' consumerp rice index (CPI) series, which was started\nduring the first TA  , was found scientificallys ound and has been subsequentlya dopted as the\nofficial governments eries, althought he Ministryo f Finance( MOF),w  ith the help of the World\nBank, has also been generatinga  CPI series. The main reservationa bout NIS' CPI figures is\nthat they reflect PhnomP  enh prices only.\n,  - \nTA 1894  CAM:  Strengthening Macroeconomic Management, for $2,415,000, approved on 21 April 1992.\n2 TA 2261- CAM: StatisticalS ystemD  evelopmentt,o r $1,200,000a, pprovedo n\"22D  ecember1 994.\nST he TA   was first listed in ADS 8uUJeas Oppatunlies  in June 1999.", "2\n6.  As the bulk of the previous  assistance  was direded  towards  NIS, the statistical  capability\nin  the  statistics  producing  arms  of  the  other  ministries  now  need  strengthening  as  well.\nParticular  attention  will be given to the Ministry of Agriculture,  Forestry  and Fisheries  (MAFF),  as\nagriculture's  shares  in both  gross  domestic  product  and  employment  are  the  highest.  Higher\nquality and more timely  availability  of agriculture  statistics will lead to a substantial  improvement\nin the  national  accounts  estimates.  Furthermore,  the  cooroination  of the  statistical  system  at .\nnational  level  needs  to  be  strengthened  so  that  the  database  being  produced  meets  the .\nrequirements  of  the  major  users  in and  outside  Government.  The  third  T A  will  help  build  a\ndurable  and sustainable  national  statistical  service.  In addition,  since  1993, the link between  the\n..'\nprovincial and municipality planning  offices,  and local government  and  provincial  offices  of the\nline  ministries  has weakened.  This  situation  has adversely  affected  statistical  activities  at the\nlocal level.\n7.  Sustainable  development  requires  a  sound  environmental  policy  (including\nenvironmental  programming).  To develop  the policy, reliable and timely  environmental  indicators\nare  needed.  In  addition,  gender  issues  will  be  given  more  attention  in  the  near  future.\nFormulating  development  policies  related  to gender  requires  gender  disaggregated  statistical\ninformation.  NIS does  not have the capability  to systematically  compile  these  environment  and\ngender  indicators.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n8.  The TA has four broad objectives. First, the TA will continue the statistical capacity\nbuilding in NIS to sustain and improve the ongoing activities started in the first two TAs. Second,\nthe TA   will help strengthen the statistical capability of the provinciala nd municipality planning\noffices. Third is to strengthent he statisticalu nits in the line ministries,p articularlyM  AFF. Fourth\nis to help strengthen the coordination of the statistical system. In the process, the TA   will also\nimprove the coverage, timeliness, and relevance of the national statistical database.\n9.  More specifically, upon completion,t he TA isexpeded to have helped the Government\naccomplish the following:\n(i) strengthening of NIS to\n(a)  improve the national accounts compilation capability and reduce the time\nlag of the annual estimates by a reasonable period;\n(b)  expand the coverage of the CPI to five major provinces;\n(c)  improve data dissemination by regularizing the production and timeliness\nof NIS publications, particularly the statistical yearbook, national accounts\nbulletin, and monthly price indixes;\n(d)  fill  critical gaps in Cambodia's socioeconomic database  by  supporting\nbasic data collection and processing secondary data;\n(e)  publish one compendium each on environment and gender indicators and\na poverty profile in Cambodia;\n(f)  train Cambodian statisticians locally and abroad; and\n(g)  establish a permanent training unit in NIS to serve the statistical staffing\nneeds of the Cambodian statistical system;", "3\n(ii).  strengtheningo f municipal and provincial planning offices that have been put\nunder the full controlo f MOP and NIS;\n(iii).  assistance to the statistical units outside MOP-NIS to\n(a)  improve the  reliability and coverage of  the  agricultural  database  and\nstrengthen the statistical capability of MAFF; and\n(b)  strengthen  statistical  capability  in  the  other  line  ministries  through\nparticipation in training programs and processing of their secondary data;\nand\n(iv).  put in place a coordination mechanism for the national statistical system.\nB.\nScope\n10.  The objectives of the TA will be met by providing NIS, MAFF, other ministries, and\nprovincial planning and statistics offices with advisory services, training, equipment, support for\ndata collection (through sample surveys), and dissemination activities. The TA framework  is\ngiven in Appendix 2.\n11.  A  steering  committee will  be  set  up  to provide  overall  guidance  and  direction  in  the\nimplementation  of the  TA.  The  committee  will  be composed  of the  Minister  of  Planning  as\nChairperson  and representatives  (not lower than director  of department  level) of MAFF, Bank of\nCambodia,  MOF,  and  other  key  data  producer  and  user  ministries  as  members.  The  NIS\nDirector  will be ex-officio  member-secretary,  while  NIS will serve  as technical  secretariat  of the\ncommittee.  The  Resident  Representative  of the  Bank's  Cambodia  Resident  Mission  (CARM)\nwill  be  a  member  of  the  committee.  The  committee  will  have  regular  quarterly  meetings  to\ndiscuss  an  agenda  prepared  by its secretary  and  technical  secretariat  In the  absence  of a\nformal  organ  to  coordinate  government  statistical  activities,  the  committee  is  to  function  as\ninterim  coordinating  body. with its collective  experience  during the TA   implementation  serving  as\na guide to the formation  of a permanent  national  statistical  coordination  agency.\n12.  The  TA  will  help  strengthen  the  statistical  coordination  at national  and  local  levels  to\nimprove  the  regular  flow  of data  to NIS.  The TA will  assist  NIS and  provincial  and  municipal\nplanning  offices  to build better  links with the offices of the line ministries  through  workshops,  in-\ncountry  training,  and  actual  data  collection.  Some  major  provincial  and  municipal  planning\noffices will be provided  with computer  equipment\n13.  A statistical  system  administration  consultant  and a national  accounts  consultant  will be\nfielded  together  at the start of the TA. They will help NIS and the steering  committee  prepare  a\nthree-year  statistical  development  program.  It will  include  an  integrated  system  of  surveys,\nspecial  studies,  training,  and  dissemination  activities  that  will  progressively  lead  to  a  much\nimproved  and expanded  national  socioeconomic  database.  The program  will include,  but should\nnot be limited  to, the activities  to be supported  by the TA.  The aim of the program  is that at the\nend of the TA there  should  be economic  aggregates,  like national  accounts,  and  key economic\nand  financial  statistics,  that  are  regularty  updated  with  reasonable  time  lags.  The  program\nshould  likewise  lead  to  social,  environment,  and  poverty  indicators  that  can  be  updated  at\nreasonable  intervals.  The proposed  program will be submitted  for deliberation  and adoption  by\nthe steering  committee.\n14.  The program will include household surveys that will continue and expand the subject\ncoverage of the socioeconomic surveys done under the earlier TA  s. These surveys will be", "4\nplanned to share  the  sampling  design  that will be based  on the  1998  population  and  housing\ncensus.  The  surveys  will  be  modules  dealing  with  different  subjects  and  conducted  at\n.\npredetermined  intervals,  e.g.  labor  force  survey.  income  and  expenditure  survey,  and\ndemographic  survey. The coverage  of the monthly  CPI, which  is currently  limited  to Phom  Penh,\nwill  be  expanded  to five  major  provinces  (Battambang,  Kampong  Cham,  Kandal,  Siem  Reap,\nand  Sihanouk  Ville).  The  TA will  help  NIS produce  one  compendium  on  environment,  one  on\ngender-indicators,  and a poverty  profile  in Cambodia. .\n.\n.\n15.  Similarly,  an integrated  system  of establishment  or enterprise  surveys  will  be developed\nto  continue  and  expand  the  coverage  of  the  earlier  Cambodian  Survey  of  Establishments.\n.\nThese  surveys  will be chosen to fill critical data gaps to produce  timely  inputs for the compilation\nof the  national  accounts.  This  objective,  if successful,  will  improve  the  timeliness  of the  NIS\n~\nnational  accounts  estimates,  which  should  discourage  the  continued  production  elsewhere  of\ncompeting,  but often conflicting  estimates.\n16.  Assistance  will be extended  to MAFF to improve  the reliability,  coverage,  and timeliness\nof the agricultural  database  by supporting  data collection  and processing.  In particular,  the TA\nwill help MAFF publish  agricultural  statistics  on a more regular and timely  basis. The T A will also\nhelp  improve  the  statistical  capability  of  MAFF  by  supporting  MAFF  staff  through  in-country\ntraining  and apprenticeship  programs.\n17.  The TA   will support the training of the staff of provincial and municipal planning offices\nand line ministries (like MAFF) both locally and overseas through long-term degree programs,\napprenticeships, diploma or certificate training, and in-country training. The TA   will finance three\nstaff  members to pursue Master's degree courses with  emphasis on  survey  methodology,\nnational accounts, and agricultural statistics. Eight staff members will attend short courses (six-\nto  ten-month  duration)  in  various  training  institutions.  Five  staff  members  will  follow  an\napprenticeship program in one of the statistics offices of a Bank developing member country.\nThe TA   will also finance in-country training courses, including staff of statistics units of the line\nministries (such as MAFF) and of provincial and municipal planning offices. A statistical training\nunit within  NIS will be established to help NIS sustain the statistical cadre both  inside and\noutside NIS.\nCost Estimatesa nd FinancingP  lan\n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,200,000e  quivalent, including a foreign\ncurrency cost of $797,000 and a local currencyc ost equivalentt o $403,000. The Bank will\nfinance, on a grant basis from the Bank-fundedT A Program,$ 1,000,000e quivalent,c omprising\n.\nthe entire foreign exchangec ost and $203,000e quivalento f the local cost. The Governmentw ill .\nfinance $200,000e quivalento f local costs. The detailedc ost estimatesa nd financing plan are\ngiven in Appendix3 . . .\nImplementation Arrangements\n19.  In the  Bank,  the Statistics  and  Data Systems  Division  of the  Economics  Development\nand  Resource  Center,  in  close  collaboration  with  CARM  and  Division  3  of  the  Programs\nDepartment  (West), will administer  the T A. NIS will be the Executing  Agency  for the T A. Overall\nguidance  and  direction  in  the  implementation  of  the  T A  will  be  provided  by  the  steering\ncommittee  (para.  11). The  Director  of NIS will serve as the contact  point  for  the  Bank  and will\nprepare  semestral  progress  reports  and a completion  report. The implementation  of the T A will\nbe  coordinated  closely  with  the  TA  activities  of other  external  agencies.  The  TA  will  require", "5\nthree years to complete from its inception in the end of 1999 and is expected to end on 30\nJanuary 2003.\n20.  The  TA will  provide  supplementary  budgets  for data collection  activities  and  equipment\n(comprised  mainly  of computing  systems)  for NIS and MAFF.  One four-wheel  drive  vehicle  will\nbe procured  for field activity  and one photocopying  machine will be bought  for T A administration\nand  statistics-related  activities.  The equipment  will be procured  following  the  Bank's  Guidelines\nfor Procurement.  All equipment  will  be tumed  over to the Government  upon  the  completion  of\nthe T A. CARM will coordinate  the procurement.\n21.  The Government will provide office space and counterpart staff for consultants. The cost\nof the price survey in Phnom Penh will be borne by the Government, enabling the TA   to finance\nthe  expansion  of  the  price  survey  to  five  major  provinces.  Starting  the  year  2001,  the\nGovernment is expected to provide more cash outlays to complement the Bank's contribution.\nThe Government is also expected to extend its financial commitment after the completion of the\nTA   to enable the statistical system to maintain its activities.\n22.  The TA will recruit nine international consultants, one each for  statistical system\nadministration, national accounts, survey managementa  nd methodology, consumer price\nsurvey, labor force surveyI  establishments urvey, environments tatistics, social statistics, and\nagriculture statistics. The consultants will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelineso n the Use of Consultants.T he terms of referenceo f consultantsa re given in\nAppendix4 . The Directoro f NIS will superviset he consultants,p rovide overall supervisiono f TA\nactivities,a nd liase betweenN  IS and the Bank.\n23.  The recipients  of the overseas  training  provided  under the TA will be nominated  by NIS\nand  approved  by the  Bank. The  recipients  need  not all come from  NIS, but  may  be statistical\nstaff  from  line  ministries  (e.g.,  MAFF)  and  local  government.  NIS with  the  help  of the  TA,  will\nensure  that the recipients  will have sufficient  English  profICiency to benefit from  the training.  The\nrecipients  will  provide  the  Bank  through  CARM  reports  on  their  learning  experience  after\nattending  training.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  recipients  will  return  to  their  original\ninstitutions.\n24.  The funds will be disbursed through CARM to NIS. NIS will receive the cash advance\nfrom CARM periodically by submitting proposed activities and estimated expenditure. NIS will\nregularly provide CARM and the Bank with the liquidation statement of expenditure.\n25.  The TA will be monitored and reviewed through missions, regular communications with\nNIS and CARM, semestral and final progress reports by NIS, and the interim and completion\nreports of the consultants. The interim reports of the consultants should be submitted to the\nBank within  one-week  after  the  completion  of the  adjvity.  The  completion  reports  of  the\nconsultants  should be submitted to the Bank within one month after the  completion  of the\nactivity. N IS will submit to the Bank a final report within .one month of the completion of the TA  .\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'SD ECISION\n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegatedb  y the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Kjngdom of\nCambodia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 for the  purpose of\nStatisticalS  ystem Developmen(t Phase3  ), and herebyr eportss uch action to the Board.", "6\n.\nAppendix 1, page 1 .\nACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\n1.  Technical assistance (TA) strengtheningm acroeconomic management', which was the\nBank's first project after resuming operations in Cambodia in 1992, had a statistical component\n.,\nto help the Department of Statistics rehabilitate and start implementing its statistical service.\nFrom that moribund department, the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) was developed, and\nmanagerial  and technical capability was gradually improved. Some  statistical activities were\n\",\ncarried out, such as the first National Social-Economic Survey, Price Survey, and Survey of\nEnterprises and Establishments. These activities were continued by TA to help NIS continue the\ninstitution  building,  strengthen  NIS'  capability  to  do  large-scale  surveys,  and  improve\nCambodia's statistical database2.\n2.  At  least 12 household and establishments urveys were conducted covering socio-\neconomicd ata, establishments,la bor force, retail-tradingu nits, and hotels and restaurants.T he\ndata  from  the  surveys have  been  entered into  some  databases, developed for  the\nsocioeconomic survey, survey of establishments,a nd labor force survey. Secondary data\ncompilation activities initiated for the compilationo f the statistical yearbook and the national\naccounts included the collection of building permits, income and expenditure accounts from\nvarious governmenta gencies,b ank reports,a nd investmentsa nd trade statistics.\n3.  Several publicationsw  ere produced,s uch as the Socio-EconomicS urvey of Cambodia\n(SESC) 1993/1994, Sampling Errors of Estimates from SESC 1993/94, Survey of Industrial\nEstablishments 1993, SESC 1996 Vol. 1 & 2, National Accounts Bulletin (No.1  to 3), Labor\nForce Bulletin, No.1; Survey of Establishments1  995, the Consumer Price Index Leaflet,\nCambodiai n Figures Leaflet,a nd MonthlyC  onsumerP rice Index.\n4.  Training was provided in the form of survey-specifictr aining, on-the-jobt raining, formal\nin-countryt raining programs,f oreign scholarshipsa, nd apprenticeships.F ive in-countryt raining\ncourses were conducted, attended by at least 120 participants. These were the Statistical\nInstitute for Asia and the Pacific's country course in practical statistics, 1995 (2.5 months, 28\ntrainees); data analysis training, 1997 (3 days, 30 trainees); data managementa nd analysis\ntraining, 1997 (5 days, 30 trainees);n ationala  ccountsw  orkshop, 1997 (2 weeks, 30 trainees);\nand a workshop on computers oftware,1 998( 2 weeks).\n5.
