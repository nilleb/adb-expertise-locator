During the March 2002 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Indonesia \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to continue support for decentralizing in the \ncommunity water supply, sanitation, and basic health services subsectors and provide technical \nassistance  (TA)  to  help  local  governments  prepare  a  project  proposal.  The  ADB  country \nstrategy and program for Indonesia for 2003-2005 recognizes decentralization and support for \nbasic  social  services  as  priorities.  The  Government  and  a  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  in \nSeptember 2002 reached understanding on the objective, scope, budget, and implementation \narrangements for the TA.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Many  rural  areas  in  Indonesia  have  priority  disease  profiles  that  include  diarrhea, \nintestinal worms, skin disease, and water-related diseases including malaria and dengue. The \nsituation results from inadequate access to clean water supply and sanitation2 combined with \nunhygienic  conditions  and  practices. This combination is dangerous. For instance, in low-\nincome communities especially, diarrhea and malnutrition interact to constrain improved child \nhealth status. Local governments are now at the forefront of influencing the health status of low-\nincome families, with access to clean water and sanitation considered as key factors.  \n \n3.  The Government expects that local autonomy will result in more and better quality local \npublic services, with local governments responding to local needs and working in partnership \nwith communities and families. However, many local governments in Indonesia\u2014especially rural \nand fiscally weak districts\u2014require outside support to build the capacity and inclination for \ninclusive  and  participatory  operations.  Communities  and  families  need  outside  support  to \ndevelop a level of responsibility and technical capability necessary for successful development \npartnerships.  \n \n4.  Government  policies  and  programs  to  help  local  governments,  communities,  and \nfamilies  meet  challenges  are  available;  they  highlight  the  essential  cross-sector  nature  of \nproblems and solutions, especially the water supply and health link. Healthy Indonesia 20103 \nlinks water supply and health in the context of strong communities, responsible families, and \nresponsive family-friendly health professionals working together on local health solutions. The \nGovernment\u2019s draft National Policy for the Development of Community-Managed Water Supply \nand Environmental Sanitation Facilities and Services4 explicitly links improved water supply and \nsanitation facilities and services with broader health outcomes and community well-being.  \n \n5.  External flows support the Government\u2019s policies and programs. The Second Water \nSupply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities Project (WSLIC II)5 and the Rural Water \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 20 February 2001. \n2  At least 100 million people in Indonesia today do not have access to convenient, reliable, and sustainable safe \nwater supply and sanitation services. This is according to the Government\u2019s National Policy on Development of \nCommunity-Managed Water Supply and Environmental Sanitation Facilities (Third Draft), 18 April 2002.  \n3  Ministry of Health. 1999. Healthy Indonesia 2010. The document sets out the Government\u2019s national health \ndevelopment program that seeks to achieve health-related millennium development goals. \n4 The draft national policy comes from the Indonesian Water Supply and Sanitation Policy Formulation and Action \nPlanning Project, executed by the World Bank\u2019s Water and Sanitation Program and funded by the Australian \nAgency for International Development. \n5  Approved by the World Bank in 2000 for $77.4 million equivalent from the International Development Association \ncredit. ", "2   \nSupply  and  Sanitation  Project  for  Nusa  Tenggara  Timur6  emphasize better hygiene and \npreventing waterborne diseases, improved water services, and sustainability of services through \ncommunity  participation.  The  ADB-financed  Family  Health  and  Nutrition  Project  (FHNP)7 \ndemonstrates strong community demand for improved water supplies and sanitation and local \nhealth official willingness to provide family-friendly support. The Government is receiving broad-\nbased support for decentralizing in the health sector, including the ADB-financed Decentralized \nHealth Services Project (DHSP),8 the World Bank-financed first and second Provincial Health \nProjects, and support for specific districts from bilateral agencies.9  \n \n6.  The  Government  envisages  a  new  operation  that  brings  together  the  successful \nparticipatory and demand-responsive aspects of WSLIC II, the community-focused and family-\nfriendly support of FHNP, and the benefits from institutional strengthening delivered by DHSP. \nDespite the experience of implementing these projects, caution and flexibility are necessary in \npreparing the proposed Community Water Services and Health Project (CWSHP). The extent to \nwhich it will blend inputs and activities in water services and health is unique. All stakeholders\u2014\nlocal governments, low-income communities and families, central agencies, and private and \nnongovernment parties\u2014must be involved in project preparation from the beginning. The cross-\nsector approach will need to directly address poverty reduction, governance, and gender issues. \nWith administrative and financial rules and regulations evolving, the project design must remain \nflexible and be developed with a sound understanding of the different social, political, and \neconomic contexts in the project areas.  \n \n7.  The Indonesia country strategy and program for 2002-2005 emphasizes reduction of \npoverty and regional imbalance in development and, in particular, providing basic services in the \ndecentralized environment. Community water services and decentralized health are included as \nprimary focus areas. CWSHP addresses three principal elements in ADB\u2019s water policy:10 (i) \npromoting a national focus on water sector reforms, (ii) improving and expanding the delivery of \nwater services, and (iii) improving governance. Lessons learned from the completed Rural \nWater Supply and Sanitation Sector Project (RWSSP),11 and findings contained in ADB\u2019s draft \nImpact Evaluation Study of Water Supply and Sanitation Projects in Selected Member Countries \nwill provide valuable inputs to the preparation of CWHSP.12 Low-income communities in fiscally \nweak districts will benefit from the project. These communities will be concentrated in ADB\u2019s \ncore focus provinces and in provinces with a low human capital base. The ensuing Project will \nlikely be a core poverty intervention in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction framework. \n \n                                                 \n6  Financed by German Development Cooperation (GTZ) and Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW). \n7  ADB. 1996.

", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will help the Government identify and prepare a project proposal for low-income \npeople in rural and peri-urban communities to improve their quality of life and health status \nthrough hygiene-related healthy behavior and supported by improved access to clean water and \nsanitation.  \n \n9.  A minimum of three districts each13 in four participating provinces will use TA resources \nto prepare detailed subproject appraisal reports (SPARs) with the following components: (i) \nempowering  local  governments,  to  strengthen  district  and  subdistrict  agencies  to  facilitate \ncommunity-based  planning  and  implementation  of  projects  that  address  hygiene-related \nbehavior needs together with water supply and sanitation needs; (ii) mobilizing communities and \nfamilies, to help low-income communities to plan, advocate, manage, and sustain water and \nsanitation services and related programs to improve the hygiene-related behavior of family \nmembers;  and  (iii)  developing  infrastructure  and  facilities,  to  provide  communities  with \nconvenient  and  sustainable  clean  water  in  adequate  quantities,  the  means  for  safe and \nconvenient disposal of fecal matter, and to provide capacity to prevent waterborne diseases. A \nfourth component will be responsibility for project coordination and implementation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will use participatory workshops to help local stakeholders identify local health \nand water and sanitation needs, assess experiences of other support programs, and develop \nlocally appropriate and sustainable solutions. The TA will consolidate data and information \ncollected during the workshops and will develop draft SPARs to improve the water services and \nhealth status of the target communities. SPARs will be finalized with the local governments \nthrough participatory workshops. Provincial governments will coordinate SPAR preparation, and \nprovinces may include proposals to strengthen their own units responsible for community water \nservices  and  related  health  services.  TA  resources  will  be  used  to  finance  a  team  of \nconsultants, participatory workshops and seminars, and surveys. \n \n11.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) has developed a scoring system to rank provinces and \ndistricts for possible project participation. Ranking considers poverty incidence, water supply \nand sanitation coverage, disease prevalence due to lack of water and sanitation, and presence \nof other water and sanitation projects. Ranking will also consider opportunities to achieve \nsynergies with FHNP, DHSP, and RWSSP; ADB\u2019s preferred geographic focus; potential for \nbilateral cofinancing; and the regional government's commitment to the WSES national policy. \nThe scoring system will be the basis for choosing up to six participating provinces (four while \nimplementing phase 1 of the project and two added when implementing phase 2).14  \n \n12.  The TA will give priority to the needs of low-income communities and families who are in \nfiscally  weak  districts  that  are  most  constrained  in  delivering  basic  services.  Participating \ndistricts will be from the selected provinces. The TA will focus on family and community-based \nsolutions since preventive measures require the systematic and pervasive involvement of entire \n                                                 \n13 Criteria for selecting districts will be the same as for selecting provinces (para. 11), supplemented by criteria that \nindicate local demand for project support such as willingness of district governments and communities to contribute \ncash and in-kind to the project and to follow project rules and approaches. \n14 Eleven provinces rank high in project participation: Southeast Sulawesi, West Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, \nSouth Kalimantan, Jambi, North Sumatra, Bengkulu, Lampung, Central Java, West Java, and Banten.  ", "4   \ncommunities. The TA requires systematic involvement of low-income people in identifying their \nneeds and finding appropriate solutions. The TA will feature participatory planning, but  the \nSPARs themselves will describe participatory processes for further mobilizing the community, \ndetailed design and implementation, and sustaining operations, based on approaches such as \nparticipatory hygiene and sanitation transformation (PHAST) and methodology for participatory \nassessments  (MPA).15  SPARs  will  also  draw  on  successful  information,  education,  and \ncommunications  programs  from  FHNP  and  DHSP.  SPARs  will  demonstrate  community, \ninstitutional, and financial readiness in line with the 2002 Joint Country Portfolio Performance \nReview for Indonesia.  \n \n13.  The first part of the consultant\u2019s report will review and analyze lessons learned from \nrelated operations. The second part will present a complete investment project based on the \ndistrict-level  SPARs.  The  SPARs  will  be  grouped  by  province.  Each  SPAR  will  be  fully \nbudgeted, and feasibility will be demonstrated in terms of technical, financial, economic, social, \nenvironmental, and institutional viability, and will include a poverty and social analysis and \nstrategy. Analyzing poverty and social impact will require gender disaggregation and attention to \nthe needs of disadvantaged groups. The consultants will prepare a thorough benefit distribution \nanalysis for each SPAR. The document will provide sufficient basis for pursuing cofinancing \nopportunities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising $530,000 in \nforeign currency and $720,0000 equivalent in local currency. It is proposed that ADB provide a \ngrant of $1.0 million equivalent to meet the entire foreign currency cost and $470,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  provide  support  facilities,  counterpart  staff,  office  facilities, \nadministrative support, and other logistical support including local ground transportation, the \ncosts of which are estimated to total $250,000 equivalent (Appendix 1). The Government has \nbeen advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \nThe Government assured that counterpart services, facilities, and funds will be available by the \nexpected starting date of the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be the Directorate General of Communicable \nDisease Control and Environmental Health (DGCDC) of MOH. The EA will be responsible for \nday-to-day decisions affecting the conduct of the TA. DGCDC will work together with the \nDirectorate  General  of  Community  Health  and  the  secretary  general  of  MOH  to  ensure \nsynergies with FHNP and DHSP are fully realized. A central technical team (CTT) will be \nestablished, chaired by the director of water and sanitation, with the chief of the planning bureau \nof MOH as deputy. Representation on the CTT and technical inputs will be required from (i) the \nPolicy Advisory Group and the Decentralization Unit of MOH; (ii) the Directorate General of \nUrban and Rural Development of Ministry of Settlements and Regional Infrastructure; (iii) the \nDirectorate  General  of  Regional  Development,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA);  (iv)  the \nDirectorate  General  of  Community  and  Rural  Empowerment,  MOHA;  and  (v)  BAPPENAS \nthrough the Directorate of Human Settlements and Housing and the Directorate of Health and \nNutrition. The CTT representatives should be head of subdirectorates and above. The CTT \n                                                 \n15 PHAST and MPA are joint programs of the World Health Organization, IRC International Water and Sanitation \nCenter (Delft), and the World Bank Water and Sanitation Program. ", "    5 \nsecretariat will function as the MOH counterpart team for the TA and will have full-time and part-\ntime suitably qualified and experienced staff with competencies in community water supply and \nsanitation, hygiene and family health, project economics and finance, and sociology. The CTT \nwill meet a minimum of four times during TA implementation. \n \n16.  ADB will engage a team of international (20 person-months) and domestic (50 person-\nmonths) consultants, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  There  will  be  four \nconsultant core teams, one for each component of the proposed project: (i) the core team on \nempowering local governments will have expertise in local water services and prevention of \nwater-borne diseases, human resources development, public-private-community partnerships \nand contracting nongovernment organizations (NGOs) for community facilitation, information \ncommunication and technology, and building local capacity for poverty and social analysis; (ii) \nthe  core  team  on  community  and  family  mobilization  will  have  expertise  in  participatory \nworkshops, assessing willingness to pay and affordability, community-based planning, baseline \nsurveys and analysis, PHAST and MPA, community-based operations and maintenance, and \nhealth impact monitoring; (iii) the core team on development of infrastructure and facilities will \nhave technical expertise in designing and constructing water supply and sanitation systems, \nfacilities and equipment to prevent waterborne diseases, environmental assessment, community \ncontracting,  appropriate  technology,  project  economics  and  financial  analysis,  and benefit \ndistribution analysis; and (iv) the core team on project coordination and implementation will have \nexpertise in project management, project financing, financial management and disbursements, \nprocurement,  and  project  performance  management.  The  consultants  will  prepare  a \ncomprehensive poverty and social analysis, which will include detailed gender disaggregation. \nFacilitators and NGOs will assist in the participatory workshops. Appendix 2 gives the outline \nterms of reference. \n \n17.  The consultant  team, in collaboration with the MOH counterpart team, will organize \nworkshops in districts to ensure participation of all stakeholders: local communities, members of \nlocal governments, water supply and sanitation and health professionals, and local NGOs. The \nconsulting team will engage local facilitators (for a total of 400 workshop days). Three types of \nworkshops will be held successively: (i) advocacy and information workshops, (ii) stakeholders\u2019 \nconsultation to identify needs and locally appropriate solutions, and (iii) workshops to discuss \nthe draft SPARs consolidated by the consultant team.  \n \n18.  The TA is expected to begin in April 2003, be implemented over 10 months, and be \ncompleted in February 2004. The consultants will produce (i) an inception report by the end of 1 \nmonth; (ii) an interim report by the end of 5 months that will, among others, include results and \nconclusions from the first two rounds of workshops; (iii) a draft final report by the end of 8 \nmonths, and (iv) the final report by the end of 10 months.  \n \nIV.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national  Yes  Sector identified as a national  Yes  \npriority in country poverty analysis?  priority in country poverty  \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia:   \n \nAccess to water supply and sanitation services are important to save women\u2019s time and to reduce the frequency of \nwater-related disease.  Furthermore, realization of the benefits from water such as improved hygiene practices and \navoided fecal contamination  is only realized when water is brought into the yard.  Secure access to ample water \nsupply is low, especially in rural areas where only 43% of households have their own drinking water supply or own \ntoilet. Diarrhea is the second  leading cause of infant morbidity and is intimately related to nutritional uptake.  Only \n69% of  all children are well-nourished and diarrhea is a leading cause of undernutrition. Indonesia is falling behind \nits own targets  for achieving improved access to water sanitation, reduction in diarrheal disease, and improvement \nin infant nutrition. Furthermore, Indonesia is unlikely to achieve the millennium development goals without \nsignificantly improved access to water, change in attitudes and  practices related to the use of water, and family \nhealth. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis  Proposed Classification: PI/GD \nAnalysis:  Technical assistance (TA  ) will examine the variation in access, attitudes, and practices in relation to \nwater, sanitation, hygiene, and related  family health in the diverse areas covered by the project province.  It will \nrecommend locally relevant approaches for targeting mothers, schoolchildren, youth, and community leaders. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis:  The proposed TA will build on lessons learned from the ADB-financed Family Health and \nNutrition Project (FHNP), the Decentralized Health Services Project, hte Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject, and  the World Bank-financed first and second Water Supply and Sanitation for Low Income Communities \nProject (WSLIC I and II).  These operations have identified important key stakeholders, their needs, and \ncontributions. \n \nParticipation strategy:  FHNP has demonstrated the importance of involving nongovernment organizations in \nimplementing overall plans while WSLIC I and II have demonstrated the need to involve local government  for \nintegration into general practice outside of the project area, to ensure sustainability, and to avoid generating \nunemployment when community facilitators and trainers are no longer required.  As with the stakeholders analysis,  \nthe proposed TA is expected to build on the experiences of FHNPand WSLIC I and II to ensure a gender-based \nand inclusive approach.  \n \nD.

The proposed project  None \nwill call for construction of small facilities such as  wells and \ntoilets, or renovation of village health clinics.  These works \nmay  require some minor compensation, which can be agreed \nupon among neighbors.  \n \nGender  Significant  The participation strategy will be key to ensuring that the  yes  \nproposed project benefits  are  delivered. In the proposed \nproject areas, the mother is generally responsible for \nmanaging water supply, for household hygiene, and for \ncarrying out decisions related to family health. Men and \ncommunity leaders are often the primary decision makers \nregarding health seeking behavior. The strategy therefore \nmust consider the prevailing norms and practices of the \ncommunity and the roles of men and women within the \nhousehold, the role of the community leaders and government \nagents such as public health personnel in project design.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n  Significant,      \n  Not Significant,    Output \nSubject  None  Strategy to Address Issues  Prepareda \nagents such as public health personnel in project design.  \nAffordability  Significant  The purpose of the project is to increase access to water,  No \nhygiene, and family health services.
