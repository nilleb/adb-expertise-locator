The Government of Uzbekistan requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to \nstrengthen the institutional framework to support capital market development. A Fact-Finding \nMission visited Tashkent from 10 to 22 February 2003 and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost, financing, and implementation arrangements for the \ntechnical assistance (TA).1 The TA logical framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Capital Market.  Although the Government has begun to establish a two-tiered financial \nsystem for private enterprises, due to ongoing government control of the banking sector and \ndifficulties in accessing the capital market by private enterprises, scarce domestic funds are \noften not allocated to the most productive uses. For larger enterprises, the nonconvertibility of \nthe local currency makes raising capital overseas, and foreign investment, problematic.  \n \n3.  The capital market has been used primarily by the State Property Committee (GOS Kom \nImushestvo or GKI) to raise funds for smaller and medium state-owned enterprises (SOEs) that \nhave been corporatized by allowing them to sell noncontrolling state shares through initial public \nofferings. Currently there are 4,700 joint stock companies (JSCs), of which approximately 3,000 \nwere originally SOEs. Of the former SOEs, 794 are currently traded on the C List of the \nUzbekistan Stock Exchange (UZSE), the list designated for privatized enterprises that meet \ncertain requirements,2 although all former SOEs are eligible for trading on the exchange and the \nover-the-counter (OTC) market.   \n \n4.  Based on high listing standards,3 only six companies, four of which are banks, are listed \non the A list of the UZSE. Although B list requirements are lower, no companies have qualified \nfor it. Less than 1% of secondary trading in listed shares takes place on a formal OTC market, \nElsis Savdo, which is controlled by the National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU).  Most secondary \ntrading of listed shares (approximately 81%) takes place on an unregulated informal secondary \nOTC \u201ccurb market.\u201d4 Based in part on poor corporate governance practices, there is limited \ninterest in investing in privatized enterprises, including those that have been listed, resulting in \nlimited trading liquidity. Transaction costs on the UZSE are high (ranging between 3.7 and \n5.7%) but have come down in recent years due to competition from the curb market. Significant \ndecisions  taken  by  the  UZSE  are  subject  to  Center  on  Coordination  Functioning  of  the \nSecurities Market (CCFSM) oversight, and the UZSE does not appear to act independently. \nMost securities market participants appear to be affiliated with the banking sector.  \n \n5.  Recent regulatory changes that removed previous restrictions on the size of corporate \nbond  issues  have  enabled  larger  domestic  enterprises  to  raise  needed  funds  through  the \ndomestic corporate bond market. An international syndicate that includes 19 local and foreign \nbanks,  Carthill  Asset  Management  Company  (Carthills),  and  one  other  nonbank  financial \ninstitution has been formed to underwrite corporate debt. This syndicate began to develop a \nsecondary corporate bond market in April of 2002 and has thus far organized nine corporate \nbond issues issues worth SUM5.67 billion, including a recent bond issue of SUM600 million with \na maturity of 2 years and a coupon rate of 28% involving a large cosmetics manufacturing \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 March 2003. \n2  Paid in capital of SUM200 million, SUM300 million total assets, 500 shareholders, one-year profitability.  Slightly \ndifferent requirements apply to banks.   \n3  Paid in capital of SUM1 billion, SUM1.5 billion total assets, 2000 shareholders, 3 years profitability, etc. Slightly \ndifferent requirements apply to banks.  \n4   In 2002, trading on the curb market was more than SUM20 billion, compared with SUM4.6 billion for the UZSE and \nSUM600,000 for the organized OTC market. ", "2  \ncompany (Pillada-Vostok). The lead underwriter was a local private bank, Business Bank, and \nthe manager of both issues was Carthills. Purchasers and underwriters of corporate debt are \ngenerally  institutions  affiliated  with  the  issuers,  including  banks.  Systemic  and  investor \nprotection  concerns  have  been  raised  based  on  these  affiliations,  inadequacy  of  financial \ndisclosure, and the absence of an independent and credible credit rating agency. \n \n6.  Capital Market Regulator. CCFSM was created by presidential decree in March of \n1996 under GKI, and replaced the State Commission on Securities established under the \nMinistry of Finance in 1995. The General Director of CCFSM is also a Deputy Chairman of GKI. \nGKI\u2019s role as the largest shareholder and seller of shares in the market, while overseeing \nCCFSM, raises significant conflict of interest concerns.5  \n \n7.  In 1998, CCFSM became a full member of the International Organization of Securities \nCommissions  (IOSCO),  a  private  organization  that  promotes  adoption  of  international  best \npractice standards of securities regulation among its members. Pursuant to IOSCO membership \nrequirements, CCFSM recently conducted a self-assessment of its compliance with IOSCO \nprinciples  and  identified,  among  others,  the  following  gaps  that  need  to  be  addressed:                      \n(i) methodology for providing clear and comprehensive interpretations of laws and regulations to \nthe public; (ii) professional staff training; (iii) development of self-regulating organizations (role \nand  regulations);  (iv)  development  of  investigation  and  surveillance  techniques;                        \n(v) coordination with NBU on regulation of bank securities activities; (vi) disclosure requirements \nfor issuers, including collective investment schemes, accounting requirements, and effective \nsanctions for noncompliance; and (vii) protection of minority shareholder rights. With respect to \ncompliance with the IOSCO principle on the operational independence of the regulator, CCFSM \nhas not committed to the timing for full implementation.  \n \n8.  CCFSM has 32 staff at its central office in Tashkent and 88 staff in 14 regional offices. \nThe Department of Professional Participants (six central office staff and regional staff) oversees \napproximately 350 professional participants in the capital market, including market institutions \n(exchange, organized OTC market, depository, etc.) and securities intermediaries, including \nenforcement-related duties. Another department (five central office staff and regional staff) \noversees regulation of JSCs to ensure compliance with the Joint Stock Company Law and \nrelated decrees and regulations. \n  \n9.  Corporate Governance Reforms.  Recently, the Government has taken measures to \npromote better corporate governance. In January 2003, the Government issued a decree \u201cOn \nIncreasing the Role and Significance of the Private Sector of the Economy\u201d6 that incorporates \nmany recommendations proposed by ADB,7 including removal of the preferential powers of \nstate  trustees  and  managers  who  represent  shares  owned  by  the  Government  to  veto \nsupervisory board decisions,8 and professionalization of their role. This decree also requires             \n(i) GKI to sell state shareholdings in JSCs of 25% or less through the stock market in 2003-\n                                                 \n5  Note one of the components of ADB. 2002.

Trustees and \nmanagers  serve  on  the  supervisory  council  without  election  by  shareholders  at  the  general  meeting  of \nshareholders.  Under  cabinet  of  ministers  resolution  361,  regardless  of  the  amount  of  capital  held  by  the \nGovernment, the state trustee or trust manager representative has de facto approval powers over actions of the \nsupervisory council (veto right).  \n   ", "    3\n2004,9 (ii) shareholder approval of the chairman of the board\u2019s employment contract, (iii) the \nboard of directors to develop an annual business plan based on profitability and dividend targets \nto be approved by shareholders, (iv) submission of a report on the results of this plan quarterly \nto the supervisory board and the linking of payment of executive directors and the supervisory \nboard chairman to financial performance, and (v) prohibits employees from becoming members \nof the supervisory board.10 To help effectively implement this Decree and develop institutional \ncapacity to promote capital market development, the CCFSM requested technical assistance \nfrom the ADB. Except for World Bank assistance in helping the CCFSM develop a computerized \nconsolidated disclosure system, the Government is not receiving any TA from other donors in \nthis area. \n \n10.  Legal and Regulatory Framework. Securities  legislation  consists  of  six  laws, \npresidential decrees, resolutions of the cabinet of ministers, and procedures and instructions. \nCCFSM is currently working on amendments to five of these laws to address a number of \nissues, including the recording of beneficial ownership of shares and restrictions on the activities \nof securities market intermediaries.11   \n \n11.  Operations and Strategy of ADB and Other Aid Agencies. In 2000, ADB provided TA \nto GKI to promote corporate governance reforms at the enterprise level for privatized firms and \nnew enterprises.12 The TA included (i) a review of the adequacy of the policy, legal, and \nregulatory framework for corporate governance and an assessment of corporate governance \npractices;  (ii)  development  of  a  suitable  framework  for  efficient  management  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s shares in enterprises; and (iii) capacity building to enhance supervision and \nregulation of enterprises. The consultant\u2019s final report contained a number of recommendations, \nincluding (i) clarification of disclosure requirements for enterprises making a public offering and \nfor public companies,  (ii) clarification of the supervisory council\u2019s role to approve and remove \nmanagement, (iii) removal of the power of state trustees and trust managers to veto supervisory \ncouncil decisions, and (iv) the need to transform CCFSM into an independent market regulator. \n \n12.  ADB is currently supporting the Government in the restructuring and liquidation of SOEs \nwithin the broader framework of reforms of corporate governance and enterprise restructuring. A \nnew TA was approved in December of 200213 that, among others, is focused on helping the \nGovernment  draft  and  implement  changes  in  the  current  legal  framework  to  establish  an \nindependent securities regulator, enhance CCFSM enforcement powers, consolidate regulation \nof the securities market into one umbrella law, and evaluate self-regulation by the UZSE. The \ncurrent TA, which is focused on capacity building of CCFSM, promotion of international best \npractice standards, and capital market development, will complement the above-referenced \nrelated assistance.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  GKI continues to own 25% or less in 2,068 JSCs. \n10 On 13 February 2003, the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued an order \u201cOn the Measures of Execution \nof Decree UP-3202\u201d (Order P-1708) to establish a special commission to improve management of privatized \nenterprises. The order, among others, reiterates the need of JSCs to hold general shareholder meetings no later \nthan April 2003 to ensure conformance with the decree.   \n11 The Law on Securities and Stock Exchanges (adopted in 1993 and amended five times), the Law on Joint Stock \nCompanies and Protection of Shareholder Rights (adopted in 1996), the Law on Securities Market Functioning \nMechanisms (adopted in 1996), the Law on Activity of Depositories in the Securities Market (adopted in 1998), and \nthe Law on Protection of the Rights of Investors in the Securities Market (adopted in 2001). This list does not \ninclude implementing regulations, which may be in the process of being drafted and/or amended.   \n12 ADB. 2000.

Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The estimated total cost of the TA is $290,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange \ncost of $175,000 and a local currency cost of $115,000 equivalent. The foreign exchange cost \nof $175,000 and local currency costs of $25,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will contribute $90,000 equivalent in kind for office \nspace, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimate are \nprovided in Appendix 2. \n   ", "    5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  CCFSM will be the Executing Agency and will provide the necessary office support, \ncounterpart staff, transportation, and other services to the consultants.  Implementation of the \nTA is scheduled to begin in September 2003 and end in July 2004. ADB will review and monitor \nthe implementation of the TA through missions and consultants\u2019 reports. \n \n17.
