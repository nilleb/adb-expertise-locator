This is a proposal for technical assistance (TA) to support capacity building in the \npensions industries of developing member countries (DMCs). The proposed program aims to \ndeepen the understanding of pension fund professionals in DMCs of international trends and \nbest practice in sustainable and responsible investment (SRI)1 and governance practices. The \nprogram will draw on the experiences of the pensions industries in more developed countries in \nAsia and elsewhere to provide training for professionals in the region. It will also seek to \nencourage  interaction  between  these  countries  and  DMCs,  both  among  (i)  pensions  and \ninvestment  professionals,  and  (ii)  relevant  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  and  SRI \nspecialists. The focus of the training will be strategies and policies pertaining to SRI, such as \nlong-term capital allocation, investment strategy, performance measurement, governance, and \nstakeholder  accountability,  which  will  have  a  substantial  impact  on  standards  of  fiduciary \nbehavior in the pensions sector in Asia. The Design and Monitoring Framework for the TA is set \nout in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is planning to engage with the DMCs\u2019 rapidly \ngrowing pensions sector through a number of TAs, with the overall objective of fostering efficient \nallocation  of  pension  resources  and  building  capacity  to  deploy  resources  responsibly  in \ndomestic productive assets.2\n \n3.  The TA will complement the activities of recent ADB projects and initiatives which have \nsupported reform of social security and pension systems in the region. For example, training \nactivities have included an ADB/ADB Institute \u201cCapacity Building Conference on Reforming \nPension Systems in the Asian Transitional Economies\u201d held in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) in 2001, together with the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Labor and Social Security. More recently, \nADB was a joint organizer in 2004 of the third Conference on Private Pensions in Asia, together \nwith  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  and  the \nInternational  Network  of  Pension  Regulators  and  Supervisors.  The  proposed  TA  is  also \ncomplementary  to  two  TAs  that  South  Asia  Governance  and  Finance  Division  (SAGF)  is \ncurrently implementing in India.3\nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Asia is experiencing an enormous demographic shift, with major implications for the \neconomies and societies of the region. A United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) study in 2002 stated that the proportion of the population aged \n65 and older is expected to more than double between 1995 and 2050 in almost all countries \nand areas of the UNESCAP region\u2014a process that has taken over a century in OECD countries. \nThe United Nations (UN) projects that Asia\u2019s proportion of the world\u2019s population aged 60 and \nolder will be 58% in 2050. Declining birth rates mean fewer offspring to provide direct support to \nparents who rely on them for care in their old age. Fewer children will also result in a smaller \nworkforce generating lower tax revenues, at a time when the introduction of social security \nschemes may be critically needed. \n \n                                                 \n1  SRI is investment that allows investors to take into account wider concerns, such as social justice, economic \ndevelopment, peace, or a healthy environment, as well as conventional financial considerations. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 22 February 2007. \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to India for State Level Pension Reform. Manila, and ADB. 2006. Technical \nAssistance to India for Implementing Pension Reforms. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  The PRC and India have by far the highest populations in the region, and some of the \nhighest projected numbers of elderly citizens. The UN\u2019s World Population Ageing: 1950\u20132050 \nreport estimated that, in 2050, approximately 20% of India\u2019s population and 30% of the PRC\u2019s \npopulation will be over 60 (by which time the ratio of PRC workers to pensioners is projected to \ndecline from 10 to 1 today to about 3 to 1). The governments of both countries have recently \ndemonstrated  awareness  of  the  challenges  that  they  face,  and  some  reform  has  been \nundertaken, e.g., introduction of the PRC\u2019s National Social Security Fund. However, pension \ncoverage of the population is still extremely low and government policy development is at an \nearly stage. \n \n6.  Public spending on pensions in Indonesia and the Philippines in 1993 was less than 1% \nof gross domestic product (GDP)4, but these countries also face aging populations. For example, \na study carried out by UNESCAP found that the number of Indonesians aged over 65 was just \n3.3% of the total population in 1980, but they accounted for 7.6% by 2000. In Vietnam, a new \npension  scheme  was  implemented  in  1995,  but  coverage  of  the  working  population  was \nestimated at only 12% in 2000. \n \n7.  Pension systems in most DMCs still have limited coverage and an inflexible structure of \nstatutory retirement payments. Many systems suffer from high rates of system evasion and low \nrates of active participation. At the same time, many public pension systems in the region have \nsignificant liabilities and face serious future funding problems, which were exacerbated by \nfinancial turmoil in 1997/98. One of the most extreme situations is in the PRC, where the legacy \nof state-owned industries leaves the government with a massive pension liability, which is \nseriously underfunded. The World Bank estimates that the unfunded pension liabilities for the \nurban population are about $900 billion or 75% of the PRC\u2019s GDP. Equally, new findings \nreleased by New Delhi-based Invest India Economic Foundation show a funding gap for state \nand central government employees in India of 56% of GDP. \n \n8.  Given  this  level  of  underfunding  in  public  pension  systems  across  Asia,  and  the \ndemographic  and  social  changes  taking  place  in  the  region,  it  is  essential  that  pension \nauthorities and managers in the region are kept informed of all developments in the global \npensions industry, including governance standards and sustainable investment practices, which \nhave an impact on their ability to meet fiduciary responsibilities and maximize long-term income \ngeneration.   \n \n9.  Key  issues  with  regard  to  sustainable  investment  and  governance  that  have  been \nidentified as critical for the pensions industry globally include the following. \n(i)  Governance  mechanisms  for  public  pension  funds,  including  examination  of \ngovernment\u2019s role as the sponsor/lead trustee and potential conflicts of interest \nbetween governments orchestrating privatization and encouraging arm\u2019s length \noversight of pension funds. \n(ii)  Mechanisms  for  establishing  consensus  on  sustainability  factors  underlying \npolicy development. \n(iii)  Pension fund structure design based on a diverse, \u201cmulti-pillar\u201d framework (as \nlaid out by the World Bank), incorporating mandatory, voluntary, and informal \nelements. \n(iv)  Investment policies that reflect truly long-term risks and opportunities, including \nsustainability factors such as climate change. \n                                                 \n4 International Labour Organization. 2001. Social security: A new consensus. Geneva. \n ", "  3\n(v)  Policies with regard to investment in overseas assets. \n(vi)  Procedures for keeping fund beneficiaries informed about investment policies \nand performance. \n(vii)  Appropriate governance and performance benchmarks for community investment \nprograms and other alternative investments.  \n \n10.  Despite the high relevance of sustainability issues to retirement schemes in Asia, there \nhas been little discussion of them in the region. Many pension fund regulators, trustees, and \nofficers  are  not  aware  of  sustainable  investment  and  governance  issues,  or  strategies  for \nincorporating SRI elements into their own practices, and are not being updated on global trends. \nEqually, professional advisers to the pensions industry in Asia have not generally been active to \ndate in providing information on these issues, despite the fact that a survey of investment \nmanagers by Mercer Investment Consulting Inc. in 2004 demonstrated that over 85% of Asian \nand Australian managers believed that the adoption of SRI practices and strategies will become \ncommonplace within the next 10 years. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The overall goal of the TA is to support capacity building in the pensions industries of \nDMCs. The focus of the TA is the development of best governance and sustainable investment \npractices in the pensions industry of DMCs, with the goal of optimizing investment performance \nand standards of fiduciary responsibility.   \n \n12.  The TA is structured to cover five DMCs that face some of the greatest challenges in the \nregion:  PRC  and  India  by  virtue  of  the  size  of  their  elderly  populations;  and  Indonesia, \nPhilippines, and Viet Nam\u2014representing DMCs that have made very little progress to date \ntoward reform of their pensions systems. \n \n13.  In all these countries, pensions policy is at an early stage of development and there is a \nlack of sophistication among practitioners. Pension fund regulators, trustees, and officers in \nthese  countries  would  greatly  benefit  from  information  about  developments  in  the  global \npensions industry, including sustainable investment practices and governance standards, which \nmay have an impact on their ability to meet fiduciary responsibilities and maximize long-term \nincome generation. \n \n14.  The objectives of the TA in the pensions industry will be to do the following. \n(i)  Increase  understanding  of  the  importance  of  SRI  and  optimizing  fiduciary \nbehavior in the pensions industry in DMCs. \n(ii)  Create  greater  awareness  in  DMCs  of  the  relationship  between  pensions \nstrategy and national social and environmental constraints. \n(iii)  Increase knowledge in the pensions industry in DMCs of global and regional \ndevelopments in SRI and governance, and examples of best practice. \n(iv)  Improve  understanding  in  the  pensions  industry  in  DMCs  of  SRI  products, \nmetrics, and performance characteristics. \n(v)  Provide pensions professionals (officers, trustees, advisers, and regulators) in \nDMCs  with  the  technical  and  operational  skills  required  for  execution  of \ngovernance and sustainable investment policies to international standards. \n ", "4   \n(vi)  Encourage dialogue between pensions professionals and NGOs, government, \nand business in DMCs on further development of sustainable investment in the \nregion. \n(vii)  Contribute to ADB's continuing efforts for supporting development of DMCs\u2019 long-\nterm capital markets, which can mitigate the mismatch of maturities. \n \n15.  This  TA  is  designed  to  form  the  first  stage  in  a  program  that  is  intended  to  be \n(i) educational; and (ii) diagnostic, with the long-term aim of identifying the most appropriate \neducational tools for a wide range of policy needs in DMCs in order to present the best of global \nSRI  practices  in  a  framework  that  is  accessible  to  pensions  professionals  and  interested \nstakeholders.    \n \n16.  The TA will deliver a number of direct outputs, but also intends to create an ongoing \nprocess  of  information  sharing  and  discussion  within  the  pensions  industry  in  the  region. \nSpecifically, this TA will target a number of rapidly changing DMCs in SRI training program for \npension professionals (pensions officers, trustees, and regulators) covering China, People\u2019s \nRepublic of, India, Indonesia, Philippines and Viet Nam, training program will be conducted for \npension professionals, and briefing seminars will be held for interested parties outside the \nindustry. TA implementation will include the establishment of an expert advisory group to guide \nthe project and, where possible, will identify suitable local partners in these DMCs, who will be \nparticularly important in identifying \u201cthought leaders\u201d in each country. \n \n17.  The TA will generate the following outputs. \n(i)  Customized training materials, including a road map for SRI implementation, \ncompilation of case studies and best practice examples, and analysis of social \nand environmental constraints in key DMCs. \n(ii)  Reports  summarizing  each  training  seminar  held  in  the  identified  DMCs, \nincluding attendance, update on level of awareness, and key themes emerging. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Major Components \n \n  a.   Analysis of Global Trends and Creation of Asia-Specific Information  \n    and Training Tools \n \n18.  This component will consist of the following. \n(i)  Analysis  of  global  trends  in  SRI  and  corporate  governance  relevant  to  the \npensions  industry,  and  research  into  best  practice  in  the  pensions  industry \naround  the  world.  Research  will  include  meetings  with  pension  industry \nprofessionals  and  other  parties,  such  as  fund  management  professionals, \ninvestment advisers, SRI experts, and relevant NGOs. \n(ii)  Examination of the importance of SRI to optimizing fiduciary behavior in the \npensions industry. \n(iii)  Compilation  of  best  practice  examples  and  case  studies  from  the  pensions \nindustry around the world, focusing where possible on Asia-based examples. \n(iv)  Formulation of road map for SRI implementation in the pensions industry in Asia, \nincluding SRI metrics, performance characteristics, and risks and opportunities \nassociated with different SRI implementation strategies. \n ", "  5\n(v)  Examination  of  social  and  environmental  constraints  in  key  DMCs  and  their \nimpact on each country\u2019s implementation road map. \n(vi)  Creation of training tools for use with pensions professionals in the DMCs. \n(vii)  Creation  of  customized  information  appropriate  for  discussion  with  other \ninterested  parties,  such  as  academics,  fund  management  professionals, \ninvestment advisers, and NGOs. \n \nb.    Training Programs and Briefing Seminars in Key DMCs \n \n19.  A training program for pension professionals (pensions officers, trustees, and regulators) \nwill be carried out in SRI training program for pension professionals (pensions officers, trustees, \nand regulators) in PRC, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Viet Nam. The training program will cover \nthe following. \n(i)  Importance  of  governance  and  sustainable  investment  policies  to  optimizing \nfiduciary behavior in the pensions industry. \n(ii)  Global and regional developments in SRI and governance, and examples of best \npractice. \n(iii)  SRI  implementation  road  map,  including  development  of  governance  and \nsustainable  investment  policies,  as  appropriate  for  each  DMC,  and  its \nrelationship with that country\u2019s social and environmental constraints.  \n(iv)  Technical  and  operational  skills  required  for  execution  of  governance  and \nsustainable investment policies to international standards under the road map, \nincluding: \n(a)  SRI metrics, performance characteristics, and risk evaluation; \n(b)  fund manager and company engagement; \n(c)  reporting and measurement mechanisms; \n(d)  accountability and communication with pension fund beneficiaries; and \n(e)  collaboration  with  other  pensions  professionals  or  third  parties  on \ngovernance and SRI issues. \n \n20.  Seminars  will  also  be  organized  in  these  DMCs  for  interested  parties  outside  the \npensions industry\u2014including government, academics, business groups, and NGOs\u2014to ensure \nthat these stakeholders are kept informed and engaged on SRI and governance issues. In \naddition to the content described in paragraph 16, these seminars will pay particular attention to \nthe interests of these other groups, for example: \n(i)  multiple stakeholder involvement in pension and social security architecture; \n(ii)  engagement between pension funds, fund mangers, and investee companies; \nand \n(iii)  communication between NGOs and pension funds on social and environmental \nissues. \n \nc.    Public Briefing Event for a Wider Audience  \n \n21.  This component of the TA will take the form of a public briefing event, to be scheduled at \na time and place to be agreed, in order to attract the widest and most relevant audience. The \nintention of the briefing is to draw in world experts, raise awareness in the wider investment \ncommunity  and  NGO  grouping,  and  to  provide  further  momentum  to  the  process  of \n ", "6   \ncommunication within the pensions industry. This briefing will update the attendees on issues \narising from the training programs and briefing seminars, including the following.  \n(i)  Importance of SRI and governance issues to optimizing fiduciary behavior in the \npensions industry in the region, and level of awareness of this link in key DMCs. \n(ii)  Level  of  relevant  technical  and  operational skills  in  the  pensions  industry  in \nidentified DMCs, and best practice examples from around the region. \n(iii)  Discussion of road map for SRI implementation (i.e., research and promotion) in \nthe  pensions  industry  in  Asia,  and  influence  of  social  and  environmental \nconstraints in individual DMCs. \n(iv)  Availability of SRI products and alternative/social investment programs, such as \nmicrofinance, in the region. \n(v)  Role of professional advisers and third parties on governance and SRI issues. \n(vi)  Interaction  between  NGOs  and  pension  funds  on  social  and  environmental \nissues. \n \n22.  In addition to informing the delegates, this public briefing event is intended to encourage \ndialogue and peer group support\u2014by facilitating communication between pension professionals \nin more developed countries and those in DMCs, as well as SRI experts and NGOs\u2014with the \naim of fostering skills transfer and collaboration on sustainability and governance issues. The \nparticipants are expected to make a financial contribution toward their attendance at the event.  \n \n23.   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n24.  The total cost of the TA will be $210,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Switzerland and administered by ADB. The budget (Appendix 2) includes a cost \nrecovery component for the briefing seminars and public briefing event. The fee of $35 per \nperson is consistent with fees charged for similar briefings in the region. The first component of \nthe program\u2014training for public pension officials\u2014does not contain a cost recovery component \nbecause socially responsible investment is still a very new concept for public pensions in Asian \ndeveloping  countries,  and  it  would  make  it  extremely  difficult  to  reach  the  most  relevant \nprofessionals if a fee is charged at the early stages of outreach to these public institutions. ADB \nshall not finance any undertaking or activity in the territory of any member country unless and \nuntil it has received from the government of each member country a letter of no objection or \nconcurrence with respect to such undertaking or activity. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. The Private Sector Operations Department \n(PSOD)  will  be  responsible  for  overall  and  day-to-day  monitoring  of  TA  activities.  The \nAssociation  for  Sustainable  &  Responsible  Investment  in  Asia  (ASrIA)  will  be  engaged  to \nimplement the TA, which consists of 13 person-months of work for research and workshop \ncoordination. ASrIA is a not-for-profit, membership association dedicated to promoting corporate \nresponsibility and SRI  practices in the Asia and Pacific region. It has a broad reach and \ncredibility  in  sustainable  and  responsible  investment  in  Asia  and  is  the  only  not-for-profit \ninstitution with a regional Asian mandate to promote SRI. Its over 100 members include Asian \nfinancial and investment institutions; development finance institutions; corporations; and not-for-\nprofit, academic, community, and government institutions. In addition, ASrIA has strong links \nwith Switzerland, which is funding the TA. \n ", "  7\n \n26.  Members include organizations such as Daiwa Securities, Nikko Asset Management, \nCalvert  Group,  Goldman  Sachs,  Henderson  Global  Investors,  Rabobank  International, \nInternational Finance Corporation, UBS Global Asset Management, Zurich Insurance Group, \nCredit  Suisse,  Bank  Sarasin,  and  Sustainable  Asset  Management  Group.  ADB  became  a \nmember of ASrIA in 2004 as part of its regional activities to support SRI.  \n \n27.  There are a number of important complementarities between the strategic priorities of \nADB and the objectives of ASrIA, with focus on: (i) sustainable development, (ii) private sector \ndevelopment  that  incorporates  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  (iii)  corporate  social \nresponsibility and good governance, and (iv) building greater awareness of the benefits of SRI \nand best practices to enhance project performance and shareholder value. \n \n28.  ASriA  has  experience  in  similar  projects  involving  organizing  and  promotion  of \nconferences,  seminars,  and  workshops  that  provide  a  platform  for  different  sectors  and \nstakeholders to exchange information and perspectives in SRI issues. ASriA also publishes \nwide-ranging research on these and related issues, and runs corporate training programs.   \n \n29.  ASrIA\u2019s flagship conference on SRI (held in Hong Kong in 2001, Tokyo in 2002, and \nSingapore in 2004) drew participants from Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. In 2003, \nASrIA was invited to run a workshop on SRI and pensions at the United Nations Environment \nProgramme Finance Initiative\u2019s Global Roundtable in Tokyo. Workshops on pension funds have \nalso been conducted in the Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Thailand; and the association \nhas developed a database of pension fund industry contacts focusing on sustainable investment \npractitioners in the pensions industry worldwide. Its 2004 international conference featured a \npensions  roundtable  including  participants  from  Australia,  the  United  Kingdom,  the  United \nStates, and New Zealand. \n \n30.  ADB will directly contract ASrIA to carry out implementation of the RETA in accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).     \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n31.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding an amount of the equivalent of $210,000, to \nbe financed by the Government of Switzerland on a grant basis, for Capacity Building for \nSustainable Investment and Governance in the Pensions Industry and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n \n ", " 8  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets and  Data Sources/  Assumptions and  \nIndicators  Monitoring  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n \nPensions industry uses  Increase proportion of pension  Pensions industry  Political forces and \nsustainable and responsible  assets/plans that are  reports  boards overseeing the \npension plans allow the \ninvestment (SRI) and good  sufficiently funded and   \nimplementation of SRI \ngovernance practices  managed in line with  Asian Development \nand good governance \nbeneficiary demands for SRI  Bank (ADB) project \n  practices \nperformance audit \nreport  \nOutcome      Risk \n  ADB project completion \nKey stakeholders in the  Ongoing duties and \n30% increase in number of  report  \npensions industry in selected  responsibilities of \npension plans in selected    training and briefing \ndeveloping member countries \nDMCs that have a statement  attendees will preclude \n(DMCs) are familiar with \nrelating to SRI in their fiduciary  them from applying \ninternational best practice in \ndocuments or are considering  their knowledge and \nSRI and good governance \nthe inclusion of such a  skills, or promoting \n  statement, and/or a change in  further appreciation and \ngovernance practices in line  knowledge within the \npensions industry \nwith international best practice \n(as defined by the technical \nassistance) within 2 years of \nattainment of outputs   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n \n1.
