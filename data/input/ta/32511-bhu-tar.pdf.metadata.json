One of CDB's primary functions is to categorize\nand classify private contracting firms employed by the Government. The Government has\nidentified the need to improve the system of managing and administering the process of\ncontractor classification, and to enhance its objectivity and transparency. The TA is in line with the\nBank's current operational strategy for Bhutan, which attaches importance to improving the\nGovernment's capacity to administer development.\n2. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Thimphu from 5 to 7 October 1998. This report is based\non the mission's findings in the field, and the understandings reached with the Government on\nthe objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the\nTA.2 Discussions were also held with the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme,\nLiaison Office of Denmark, and Austrian Coordination Bureau. They welcomed the TA as a step\ntoward improving the environment for project implementation.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Traditionally, industrial development in Bhutan is mainly initiated by the public sector.\nThe industry sector's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) increased to 31 percent in\n1996 from 17 percent a decade ago, and grew by 10 percent in 1996. With faster\nindustrialization and urbanization in Bhutan in recent years, the construction subsector almost\ndoubled its share to 9 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1996.\n4. As the number of projects to be financed by different sources is expected to increase,\nnotably in the area of construction, there is a pressing need to ensure that Government\nagencies have a competent pool of readily available contractors. Furthermore, it is important\nthat a system be introduced that encourages high performance by contractors. In doing so, the\nGovernment intends to introduce a mechanism that facilitates the selection of competent\ncontractors to undertake capital projects in a cost-effective and timely manner, and to accepted\nstandards.\n5. Current registration of contractors is based on a single classification system, for civil\nworks only, which groups contractors according to size: very small, small, medium, and large.\nConsultants engaged under TA 2802 recommended that contractors be categorized into eight\nareas of expertise, and contractors in each area of expertise be classified into four groups,\nnamely, very small, small, medium, and large, based on their technical capabilities, financial\ncapacities, and experience. To implement this, the TA will create a management information\nsystem (MIS), comprising manual and automated processes, to enhance CDB's capacity to\nadminister procurement and contracting procedures. The core of the MIS will be a computerized\ndatabase that provides rapid access to contractor information, and a means of compiling\naccurate summaries and reports. The MIS will help strengthen CDB's functions and will serve\nas a means to implement the regulatory framework for procurement and contracting\nrecommended under TA 2802.\nTA BHU 2802: Improvement of a Regulatory Framework for Procurement and Contracting, for $400,000, approved\non 23 May 1997.\nz The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in October 1998 (Internet version).", "2\n6. Currently, CDB classifies and evaluates contractors on the basis of questionnaires\ncompleted by them and inputs from the line ministries on performance of contractors. As these\ninputs are subjective and create the opportunity for inconsistencies in the ratings, it was\nrecommended under TA 2802 to improve the system and evaluation methodology by\ncategorizing contractors according to the type of work they are able to carry out, such as roads,\nbridges, buildings, and irrigation and drainage works (i.e., areas of expertise), in addition to\nclassifying them according to the value or volume of work (very small, small, medium, and\nlarge). Such classification and categorization will form part of, and be reflected in, the\ncomputerized system that will add transparency to this procedure. Accurate listings of\ncompleted evaluations and audits as well as the implementation of a scoring mechanism will\ncreate a paper trail that will facilitate objective decision making. The computerized system will\ncreate an automated scoring and evaluation model, reducing the scope for manipulating or\nfalsifying data inputs.\n7. CDB currently operates with three permanent staff who have few facilities. The work is\ncontinuous (since the data is updated regularly) and the amount of information generated is\nvoluminous and complex. The computerization component aims to simplify the task of entering\ndata by enabling direct input of relevant information into a central file. The system adopted from\nthe outputs of TA 2802 will further simplify this task and produce the appropriate classification,\ncategorization, and scoring. Where assessment and judgement are required, the operator will\nbe able to enter standardized codes based on information contained in the evaluation/audit\nreport. The actual evaluation will be performed by the line ministries, representatives of CDB, or\nthe Royal Audit Authority. The computerization will ensure objectivity and assist in the\nprevention of manipulation.\n8. In addition, line ministries making use of contractors registered in the database will be\nable to report on their performance during the execution of contracts. Such information will be\ncontained in performance evaluation reports, again designed around a scoring system, which\nwill then be entered into the database. To ensure that line ministries' evaluations of contractors\nare objective, fair, and unbiased, a special mechanism will be explored, using triple, \"blind\"\nevaluators, random checks of assessments, publications of the evaluations, and a reliance on\nverifiable indicators. Thus, CDB will be able to maintain complete records of contractors, leading\nto their categorization and classification. This will provide line ministries with rapid access to up-\nto-date availability and evaluation of suitably qualified contractors.\n9. The information contained in the database will be easily accessible by way of reports.\nThe TA will develop a collection of reports, which can be generated using information contained\nin the database. For example, it will be possible to generate reports with information such as a\nfull list of contractors in a specific class, information about a specific contractor, reasons why\ncontractors have failed to be registered, and details of contractors who have successfully\ncompleted specific (and difficult) projects.\n10. Staff at CDB, line ministries, and government agencies will require training in the use of\nthe computer database and in the preparation and completion of the forms and questionnaires\nneeded to collate information for inputting into the database. In addition, CDB will need training\nin the use of the system outputs so as to better manage the categorization and procurement of\ncontractors. Once the contractor database is completed, it can be used as a model for other line\nministries who need similar databases, such as for specialist suppliers. This can be achieved\ncomparatively easily by using the basic software developed for the contractor database.", "3\n11. The TA will provide assistance that will benefit not only the public sector but will also\nhelp private contractors through the use of transparent registration procedures, which will\nenable them to identify areas for improvement in their own resources and operations.\nContractors can improve their performance only if assisted to understand the new system.\nContractors, therefore, will also need to be trained concerning the inputs required on their\nperformance and the implications such inputs will have on their participation in procurement and\ncontracting.\n12. Notwithstanding the existence of a judiciary, appropriate legislative provisions are\nneeded to deal with disputes involving the procurement rules and regulations and to resolve\ncontractual disputes during implementation. Disputes have often been caused by\nmisunderstandings of the procurement rules, and have prolonged the procurement process. To\navoid these delays, a simple and fast arbitration system will be devised for use by PWD and\nCDB, to enable procurement tasks to be completed satisfactorily and in a timely manner.\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n13. The main objectives of the TA are to assist the Government in implementing the national\ncontractor registration and classification system defined under the earlier Bank-assisted TA\n2802, and to increase the Government's capacity to enforce accountability among contractors.\nThis will be accomplished by the creation of an MIS that will assist in the collection and\nadministration of contractor data. The core of the MIS will be a computerized database that\nstores details of each contractor, including a history of previous work and an evaluation of their\nperformance. This will be accompanied by targeted training and the creation of a simplified\narbitration system. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n14. The scope of the TA comprises: (i) reviewing and, if necessary, modifying the national\ncontractor registration and classification system to facilitate its computerization; (ii)\nimplementing an information flow that assures timely and accurate data inputs to the system;\n(iii) defining the necessary system outputs for effective decision-making; (iv) developing a\ndatabase application to assist in the collection, storage, and processing of contractor data; (v)\ndeveloping operational guidelines to ensure that classification and registration of contractors is\ncomprehensive, and that the MIS is properly used and maintained; (vi) procuring and installing\nadequate computer equipment, and providing personnel to support the database application;\n(vii) institutionalizing the use of the MIS by providing appropriate training, as well as monitoring\nand optimizing its operations; (viii) providing adequate and targeted training to contractors and\ngovernment officials; and (ix) creating a simplified arbitration system to streamline conflict\nresolution procedures for the Government and contractors.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $470,000 equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is $346,000. The Bank will finance the full foreign exchange cost and the\nequivalent of $54,000 to cover local expenditures. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a\ngrant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program. The Government will provide the remaining\ncosts of $70,000 equivalent, covering office facilities and counterpart support services. Details\nof the cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2.", "4\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n16. CDB, as the Executing Agency for the TA, will provide a project coordinator and full-time\ncounterpart professionals for a total of about 18.5 person-months, support staff, office space,\nand facilities. CDB will be responsible for coordinating, steering, and monitoring the counterpart\nactivities. To ensure sustainability, CDB and MOC will ensure that staff trained as administrators\nof the MIS will not be transferred for a minimum period of one year after completion of the TA\nand that no transfers will occur after this period until the administrators have trained other\nsuitable staff within CDB, line ministries, and executing agencies.\n17. The TA will be carried out by a team of four individual consultants possessing the\nfollowing expertise: (i) information system specialist/team leader (seven person-months); (ii)\nprocurement consultant (three person-months); (iii) procurement legislation consultant (two and\na half person-months) and (iv) domestic computer consultant (six person-months). The\nconsultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements for the recruitment of the domestic consultant. It is\nexpected that the consultants will commence their services in April 1999 and complete their\nwork in March 2000, including workshops for training. The outline terms of reference for the four\nconsultants are provided in Appendix 3.\n18. The consultants will prepare the following reports and documents at key phases of the\nTA: (i) an inception report one month after commencement; (ii) an interim report describing the\nwork accomplished and recommendations for the computerized database, at the TA mid-point;\nand (iii) a draft final report describing the services performed and recommendations to improve\nthe established computerized database, two weeks prior to completion of the team leader's\nassignment. A tripartite meeting will be held between the Government, the Bank, and the\nconsultants to discuss the interim report submitted by the consultants. As both English and\nBhutanese (Dzhongka) are the official languages in Bhutan, all reports and documents will be\nprepared and circulated in English.\n19. A leased vehicle, personal computers, a printer, a facsimile machine, and other office\nequipment and supplies will be financed under the TA. These items will be procured by CDB in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Local taxes and duties will be waived by\nthe Government. The TA will also provide reference documents and publications related to\nprocurement for use by CDB.\n20. To achieve the objectives of the TA, coordination will be undertaken with other\nmultilateral and bilateral funding agencies in Bhutan to ensure that there will not be an overlap\nbetween the scope of work carried out under the TA and programs financed by these other\nagencies.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Royal Government of Bhutan in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 for the purpose of Capacity Building of the\nConstruction Development Board, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTA FRAMEWORK\n\t \t \t\nDesign Summary Targets/Indicators Monitoring Mechanisms Risks/Assumptions\n1.

One of CDB's primary functions is to categorize\nand classify private contracting firms employed by the Government. The Government has\nidentified the need to improve the system of managing and administering the process of\ncontractor classification, and to enhance its objectivity and transparency. The TA is in line with the\nBank's current operational strategy for Bhutan, which attaches importance to improving the\nGovernment's capacity to administer development.\n2. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Thimphu from 5 to 7 October 1998. This report is based\non the mission's findings in the field, and the understandings reached with the Government on\nthe objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the\nTA.2 Discussions were also held with the World Bank, United Nations Development Programme,\nLiaison Office of Denmark, and Austrian Coordination Bureau. They welcomed the TA as a step\ntoward improving the environment for project implementation.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Traditionally, industrial development in Bhutan is mainly initiated by the public sector.\nThe industry sector's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) increased to 31 percent in\n1996 from 17 percent a decade ago, and grew by 10 percent in 1996. With faster\nindustrialization and urbanization in Bhutan in recent years, the construction subsector almost\ndoubled its share to 9 percent of GDP between 1991 and 1996.\n4. As the number of projects to be financed by different sources is expected to increase,\nnotably in the area of construction, there is a pressing need to ensure that Government\nagencies have a competent pool of readily available contractors. Furthermore, it is important\nthat a system be introduced that encourages high performance by contractors. In doing so, the\nGovernment intends to introduce a mechanism that facilitates the selection of competent\ncontractors to undertake capital projects in a cost-effective and timely manner, and to accepted\nstandards.\n5. Current registration of contractors is based on a single classification system, for civil\nworks only, which groups contractors according to size: very small, small, medium, and large.\nConsultants engaged under TA 2802 recommended that contractors be categorized into eight\nareas of expertise, and contractors in each area of expertise be classified into four groups,\nnamely, very small, small, medium, and large, based on their technical capabilities, financial\ncapacities, and experience. To implement this, the TA will create a management information\nsystem (MIS), comprising manual and automated processes, to enhance CDB's capacity to\nadminister procurement and contracting procedures. The core of the MIS will be a computerized\ndatabase that provides rapid access to contractor information, and a means of compiling\naccurate summaries and reports. The MIS will help strengthen CDB's functions and will serve\nas a means to implement the regulatory framework for procurement and contracting\nrecommended under TA 2802.\nTA BHU 2802: Improvement of a Regulatory Framework for Procurement and Contracting, for $400,000, approved\non 23 May 1997.\nz The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in October 1998 (Internet version).", "2\n6. Currently, CDB classifies and evaluates contractors on the basis of questionnaires\ncompleted by them and inputs from the line ministries on performance of contractors. As these\ninputs are subjective and create the opportunity for inconsistencies in the ratings, it was\nrecommended under TA 2802 to improve the system and evaluation methodology by\ncategorizing contractors according to the type of work they are able to carry out, such as roads,\nbridges, buildings, and irrigation and drainage works (i.e., areas of expertise), in addition to\nclassifying them according to the value or volume of work (very small, small, medium, and\nlarge). Such classification and categorization will form part of, and be reflected in, the\ncomputerized system that will add transparency to this procedure. Accurate listings of\ncompleted evaluations and audits as well as the implementation of a scoring mechanism will\ncreate a paper trail that will facilitate objective decision making. The computerized system will\ncreate an automated scoring and evaluation model, reducing the scope for manipulating or\nfalsifying data inputs.\n7. CDB currently operates with three permanent staff who have few facilities. The work is\ncontinuous (since the data is updated regularly) and the amount of information generated is\nvoluminous and complex. The computerization component aims to simplify the task of entering\ndata by enabling direct input of relevant information into a central file. The system adopted from\nthe outputs of TA 2802 will further simplify this task and produce the appropriate classification,\ncategorization, and scoring. Where assessment and judgement are required, the operator will\nbe able to enter standardized codes based on information contained in the evaluation/audit\nreport. The actual evaluation will be performed by the line ministries, representatives of CDB, or\nthe Royal Audit Authority. The computerization will ensure objectivity and assist in the\nprevention of manipulation.\n8. In addition, line ministries making use of contractors registered in the database will be\nable to report on their performance during the execution of contracts. Such information will be\ncontained in performance evaluation reports, again designed around a scoring system, which\nwill then be entered into the database. To ensure that line ministries' evaluations of contractors\nare objective, fair, and unbiased, a special mechanism will be explored, using triple, \"blind\"\nevaluators, random checks of assessments, publications of the evaluations, and a reliance on\nverifiable indicators. Thus, CDB will be able to maintain complete records of contractors, leading\nto their categorization and classification. This will provide line ministries with rapid access to up-\nto-date availability and evaluation of suitably qualified contractors.\n9. The information contained in the database will be easily accessible by way of reports.\nThe TA will develop a collection of reports, which can be generated using information contained\nin the database. For example, it will be possible to generate reports with information such as a\nfull list of contractors in a specific class, information about a specific contractor, reasons why\ncontractors have failed to be registered, and details of contractors who have successfully\ncompleted specific (and difficult) projects.\n10. Staff at CDB, line ministries, and government agencies will require training in the use of\nthe computer database and in the preparation and completion of the forms and questionnaires\nneeded to collate information for inputting into the database. In addition, CDB will need training\nin the use of the system outputs so as to better manage the categorization and procurement of\ncontractors. Once the contractor database is completed, it can be used as a model for other line\nministries who need similar databases, such as for specialist suppliers. This can be achieved\ncomparatively easily by using the basic software developed for the contractor database.", "3\n11. The TA will provide assistance that will benefit not only the public sector but will also\nhelp private contractors through the use of transparent registration procedures, which will\nenable them to identify areas for improvement in their own resources and operations.\nContractors can improve their performance only if assisted to understand the new system.\nContractors, therefore, will also need to be trained concerning the inputs required on their\nperformance and the implications such inputs will have on their participation in procurement and\ncontracting.\n12. Notwithstanding the existence of a judiciary, appropriate legislative provisions are\nneeded to deal with disputes involving the procurement rules and regulations and to resolve\ncontractual disputes during implementation. Disputes have often been caused by\nmisunderstandings of the procurement rules, and have prolonged the procurement process. To\navoid these delays, a simple and fast arbitration system will be devised for use by PWD and\nCDB, to enable procurement tasks to be completed satisfactorily and in a timely manner.\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n13. The main objectives of the TA are to assist the Government in implementing the national\ncontractor registration and classification system defined under the earlier Bank-assisted TA\n2802, and to increase the Government's capacity to enforce accountability among contractors.\nThis will be accomplished by the creation of an MIS that will assist in the collection and\nadministration of contractor data. The core of the MIS will be a computerized database that\nstores details of each contractor, including a history of previous work and an evaluation of their\nperformance. This will be accompanied by targeted training and the creation of a simplified\narbitration system. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n14. The scope of the TA comprises: (i) reviewing and, if necessary, modifying the national\ncontractor registration and classification system to facilitate its computerization; (ii)\nimplementing an information flow that assures timely and accurate data inputs to the system;\n(iii) defining the necessary system outputs for effective decision-making; (iv) developing a\ndatabase application to assist in the collection, storage, and processing of contractor data; (v)\ndeveloping operational guidelines to ensure that classification and registration of contractors is\ncomprehensive, and that the MIS is properly used and maintained; (vi) procuring and installing\nadequate computer equipment, and providing personnel to support the database application;\n(vii) institutionalizing the use of the MIS by providing appropriate training, as well as monitoring\nand optimizing its operations; (viii) providing adequate and targeted training to contractors and\ngovernment officials; and (ix) creating a simplified arbitration system to streamline conflict\nresolution procedures for the Government and contractors.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $470,000 equivalent, of which the foreign\nexchange cost is $346,000. The Bank will finance the full foreign exchange cost and the\nequivalent of $54,000 to cover local expenditures. The TA will be financed by the Bank on a\ngrant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program. The Government will provide the remaining\ncosts of $70,000 equivalent, covering office facilities and counterpart support services. Details\nof the cost estimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 2.", "4\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n16. CDB, as the Executing Agency for the TA, will provide a project coordinator and full-time\ncounterpart professionals for a total of about 18.5 person-months, support staff, office space,\nand facilities. CDB will be responsible for coordinating, steering, and monitoring the counterpart\nactivities. To ensure sustainability, CDB and MOC will ensure that staff trained as administrators\nof the MIS will not be transferred for a minimum period of one year after completion of the TA\nand that no transfers will occur after this period until the administrators have trained other\nsuitable staff within CDB, line ministries, and executing agencies.\n17. The TA will be carried out by a team of four individual consultants possessing the\nfollowing expertise: (i) information system specialist/team leader (seven person-months); (ii)\nprocurement consultant (three person-months); (iii) procurement legislation consultant (two and\na half person-months) and (iv) domestic computer consultant (six person-months). The\nconsultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants and other arrangements for the recruitment of the domestic consultant. It is\nexpected that the consultants will commence their services in April 1999 and complete their\nwork in March 2000, including workshops for training. The outline terms of reference for the four\nconsultants are provided in Appendix 3.\n18. The consultants will prepare the following reports and documents at key phases of the\nTA: (i) an inception report one month after commencement; (ii) an interim report describing the\nwork accomplished and recommendations for the computerized database, at the TA mid-point;\nand (iii) a draft final report describing the services performed and recommendations to improve\nthe established computerized database, two weeks prior to completion of the team leader's\nassignment. A tripartite meeting will be held between the Government, the Bank, and the\nconsultants to discuss the interim report submitted by the consultants. As both English and\nBhutanese (Dzhongka) are the official languages in Bhutan, all reports and documents will be\nprepared and circulated in English.\n19. A leased vehicle, personal computers, a printer, a facsimile machine, and other office\nequipment and supplies will be financed under the TA. These items will be procured by CDB in\naccordance with procedures acceptable to the Bank. Local taxes and duties will be waived by\nthe Government. The TA will also provide reference documents and publications related to\nprocurement for use by CDB.\n20. To achieve the objectives of the TA, coordination will be undertaken with other\nmultilateral and bilateral funding agencies in Bhutan to ensure that there will not be an overlap\nbetween the scope of work carried out under the TA and programs financed by these other\nagencies.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n21. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Royal Government of Bhutan in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 for the purpose of Capacity Building of the\nConstruction Development Board, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTA FRAMEWORK\n\t \t \t\nDesign Summary Targets/Indicators Monitoring Mechanisms Risks/Assumptions\n1.
