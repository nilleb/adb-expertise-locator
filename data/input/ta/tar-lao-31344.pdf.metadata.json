INTRODUCTION\n1. The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has requested the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to prepare a project to improve\nlivelihoods through tree plantations, to build on the successful experiences of the ongoing\nIndustrial Tree Plantation Project (ITPP).1 The Fact-Finding Mission visited Lao PDR from 23 to\n29 September 2001 and discussed the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and\nimplementation arrangements for the TA. These were defined through a consultative process\nthat included the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and its departments and provincial\noffices, external aid agencies, the private sector (including smallholders, and small and large\nenterprises), nongovernment organizations, and other local stakeholders. The proposed Project\nwill support poverty reduction by enhancing livelihoods through tree planting activities. The TA is\nincluded in ADB\u2019s 2001 TA program for the Lao PDR.2\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Government Policies and Plans. Forest cover in the Lao PDR was reduced from 70\npercent of the land area in the 1940s to 47 percent or less by 1999. The Government has\nrecognized the problems associated with the severe loss of forest cover, and has attempted to\naddress them with a series of policy initiatives to (i) improve regulation of logging and other\nforest  extraction  activities;  (ii)  attempt  to  contain  shifting  cultivation  by  encouraging  fixed\ncultivation; (iii) develop partnerships with village communities to enable the allocation of forest\nland, and hand-over of responsibility for forest management to them, enabling more equitable\nsharing of benefits from the forest; and (iv) encourage private individuals and organizations to\ntake a lead in establishing plantations of commercial tree species.3 In 1997, the Department of\nForestry developed a \u201cVision 2020\u201d to translate policy into strategies. The vision encourages\nincreased  plantation  forestry,  focusing  on  degraded  forest  land,  and  strong  private  sector\ninvolvement in this.\n3. The New Economic Mechanism adopted by the Government in 1986 was intended to\nprovide an impetus for the private sector to take a larger role in the economic development of\nthe country. In the forestry sector, the development of the National Forestry Action Plan and\nsubsequent  decrees  have  provided  a  comprehensive  legal  framework  to  facilitate  the  tree\nplanting programs and activities. The Forestry Law of 1996 and the Land Law of 1997 have\nbroadened the role of forest plantations, which must contribute to meeting the national target of\nincreasing forest cover and the income needs of people. One of the six programs highlighted in\nthe National Forestry Action Plan is the promotion of plantation forestry, with the objective to\nrehabilitate and reforest unstocked, denuded, eroded, and degraded forest land.\n4. Forest Plantation in the Lao PDR. The establishment of forest plantations in the Lao\nPDR has traditionally focused on teak, although the use of fast growing Acacia or Eucalyptus\nspecies is rapidly increasing, particularly in the lowlands. This change has arisen mainly through\nthe recognition of market opportunities for paper pulp and wood chip products, which are highly\nsuited  to  fast-growing  species.  While  teak  is  potentially  highly  valuable,  log  prices  largely\ndepend on diameter. Although markets exist for smaller teak logs, for the full economic potential\nof teak to be realized, silvicultural practices must be improved. The extension of the benefits of\ntree plantation to poorer, less advantaged groups is a challenge that a number of development\nprograms are starting to address (para. 6).\n                  \n1  Loan 1295-LAO: Industrial Tree Plantation Project, for $11.2 million, approved on 22 December 1993.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in October 2001.\n3  The World Bank recently reviewed production forestry, and is considering options to support regulation and control\nof logging in natural forests in the Lao PDR.", "2\n5. Lessons Learned. The ongoing ITPP supports the use of degraded and unstocked\nforest land for plantation on a commercial basis. The ITPP has (i) catalyzed the adoption of\nplantation  forestry  in  the  Lao  PDR,  and  (ii)  demonstrated  the  potential  to  provide  income\ngeneration opportunities to rural poor villagers and contribute to economic growth in the country.\nThe ITPP has helped improve the technical capability within the Department of Forestry to\nsupport  plantation  forestry,  raise  the  profile  of  plantations  among  the  private  sector  and\nindividual farmers, and establish workable processes for participatory planning of plantation\nforestry. Lessons learned under the ITPP focus on the need to continue to develop a body of\nexpertise in plantation forestry in the country. Although considerable progress has been made in\nplantation establishment, ongoing extension and services to improve plantation quality are still\nneeded. The process of providing credit to villagers for plantation establishment needs to be\nstreamlined,  by  developing  options  to  increase  credit  availability  and  facilitate  timely\ndisbursements.  The  need  to  link  credit  processing  to  the  annual  planting  cycle  is  being\naddressed under the ITPP, but further support is needed, to match cash flow requirements and\ncredit repayments. For smallholders, links to markets are critical. Gender sensitization training\nunder the ITPP has been a useful tool in enhancing benefits. Experience emphasizes the\nimportance of careful participatory planning at the village level, and clarification of issues of land\nsecurity and forest tenure.\n6. The Government of Sweden has provided TA to the Lao PDR Government in the natural\nresources sector since 1977, through the Lao-Swedish Forestry Program. Over the years, the\nprogram\u2019s  orientation  has  changed  from  forestry  operations  to  sustainable  land  use,  and\nsupport for greater decentralization. The lessons learned during the 24 years have been well\ndocumented. They emphasize the need for a long-term vision and commitment, to enhance\nparticipation in land management at all levels and foster a strong sense of ownership among\ntarget beneficiaries. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), through the Forest\nConservation and Afforestation Project (FORCAP), has promoted tree planting in the context of\nrehabilitation of land that has been degraded through intensive logging and slash-and-burn\nactivities. FORCAP has begun to make advances in developing land-use systems that provide\nsustainable  alternatives  to  slash-and-burn  agriculture,  and  provides  a  potential  model  for\ndeveloping plantation systems for poor farmers to replace shifting cultivation on sloping land\nareas.  Other  funding  agencies,  primarily  the  Danish  development  assistance  program  and\npotentially the World Bank, are likely to focus primarily on activities directed at the natural forest\nsector, expected to focus on village forestry, forest conservation, and promotion of related policy\nand market reforms.\n7. Poverty and Social Impact. The Lao PDR is one of the poorest countries in the world,\nranking 140th out of 174 countries in the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s Human\nDevelopment Report in 2001 and with 39 percent of its population living below the poverty line\nin 1997/98.4 The country\u2019s poverty is characterized by regional, ethnic, and gender inequality;\nlow human resource development; lack of economic opportunities; insecure property ownership;\nand impoverishment due to degraded natural resources and difficulties in adjusting to changing\nlivelihood patterns, especially in the uplands. In its Fifth Five-Year Socioeconomic Development\nPlan (2001-05), the Government has presented ambitious targets of eradicating poverty and\nstopping shifting cultivation by 2010, and graduating from the status of least developed country\nby 2020 by becoming an industrialized economy based on its natural resources. These targets\nare reflected in the poverty partnership agreement, signed by the Government and ADB on\n28 September 2001. The agreement identifies a strategic focus that includes agriculture and\nrural  development.  ADB  will  work  with  the  Government  to  reduce  poverty  by  broadening\ncommunity  participation  and  opportunities  over  the  next  five  years.  To  achieve  this,  it  is\n                  \n4  Government of Lao PDR. 2000. Report to the Seventh Round Table Meeting. Vientiane.", "3\nimportant for the forestry sector to provide economic opportunities through plantation forestry to\nenhance livelihoods of the rural poor. There is also a need to pay particular attention to the land-\nforest  allocation  process,  as  the  recently  completed  participatory  poverty  assessment  has\nidentified insecure land tenure and lack of transparency in land allocation and titling as key\nproblems of poverty.5 Gender analysis needs to be incorporated in this process.\n8. Development Needs. The ITPP has demonstrated the willingness and capability of\nindividual  farmers  and  private  enterprises  to  engage  in  production  forestry  through  tree\nplantations.  There  are  potential  economic,  social,  and  environmental  benefits  from  further\ndevelopment of the commercial plantation sector in the Lao PDR, which is still at an early stage\nof development. The Lao PDR is well located to serve the wood deficit countries of the region.\nThis will be further strengthened if the country is able to economically access international port\nfacilities through Vinh and Da Nang in Viet Nam. The ongoing development of market-oriented\npolicies is vital to plantation development in the Lao PDR and there is a continuing need to\ndevelop  this  understanding,  both  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels.  The  sector  needs\ncontinued assistance to (i) build links between larger scale plantation investors and small-scale\nfarmers  to  have  greater  impacts  on  poverty  reduction,  and  (ii)  ensure  that  private  sector\ninvolvement and interest in plantations is maintained and grows over time. To further increase\nprivate sector investment in plantations and processing, remaining constraints in the policy\nenvironment need to be addressed.\n9. ADB\u2019s  Country  Strategy  and  Program  (2002-2004)  for  the  Lao  PDR  provides  four\nthematic priorities to realize the strategic goal of poverty reduction: (i) rural development and\nmarket linkages, (ii) human resource development, (iii) sustainable environmental management,\nand (iv) private sector participation and regional integration. A major share of project lending is\nfocused on the northern region provinces, which have the highest incidence of poverty, and on\nSavannakhet Province, where ongoing subregional projects provide low-cost access to larger\nmarkets.6 Lending includes community-based rural development projects and ADB interventions\nmust address environmental issues. Developing alternative livelihood schemes in rural areas is\nan important need felt by the Government to stabilize shifting cultivation, and commercial tree\nplantation and allied wood processing enterprises provide an opportunity for supplementary and\nalternative income generation.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective and Scope\n10. The objective of the TA is to prepare an investment Project that will improve livelihoods\nof the rural population through tree plantation. Plantations will be placed on degraded forest\nland, and no primary forest will be touched or opened to traffic. Where appropriate, indigenous\nand native species will be encouraged. The proposed Project will continue to promote private\nsector commercial tree plantation by smallholders, groups of farmers, small enterprises, and\nlarger private companies in Bolikhamxai, Champassak, Khammouan, Saravane, Savannakhet,\nand Vientiane provinces, and in Vientiane Prefecture.\n11. The  TA  will  develop  a  project  framework  that  (i)  provides  income  generation\nopportunities  to  improve  livelihoods  of  rural  communities,  (ii)  increases  private  sector\nparticipation  in  commercial  plantation,  (iii)  rehabilitates  degraded  forest  land  area  through\nplantation, and (iv) strengthens the capacity of the extension system to support tree plantation.\n                  \n5  ADB,  State  Planning  Committee,  and  National  Statistics  Center.  2001.

The TA will develop project components for commercial tree plantation in provinces\ncovered under the ITPP, to benefit from the capacity and interest established there. To address\nthe constraints observed and lessons learned, the TA will (i) review institutional, technical, and\nsocial aspects, and credit and marketing arrangements under the Project; (ii) develop revised\narrangements for the provision of credit to small plantation investors; (iii) develop objective\ncommercial plantation models with cost norms; and (iv) develop criteria for assessing technical\ncapability and support of private companies involved in plantation forestry.\n13. The TA will further assess the policy environment to enable increased private sector\ninvestment in plantations and processing, building on the findings of earlier sector work.7 In\nparticular,  the  lack  of  readily  available  basic  information  on  plantation  establishment  and\nmanagement will be addressed through development of a database. Strategies to generate links\nbetween  government  reforestation  efforts  and  private  plantation  development  will  also  be\nconsidered, in an effort to reduce market distortions that create disincentives for plantation\ninvestments.\n14. To encourage increased involvement of both smallholders and the private sector in\nplantation forestry, the TA will develop information services on technical and marketing aspects\nto support and enhance extension services. The potential for guaranteed purchase agreements\n(buy-back arrangements) between private companies and smallholders will be assessed. Linked\nwith this, the TA will also estimate the existing and required capacity for wood processing, and\nrecommend realignment and expansion of capacity as required to support market development.\nBased  on  recent  experience  and  the  developing  needs,  the  TA  will  design  appropriate\narrangements for the provision of credit to small plantation investors.\n15. To strengthen extension services, the TA will identify gaps in technical skills in plantation\nestablishment and management, including environmental management of plantation activities,\nto be addressed under an ensuing project. Appropriate scope and delivery mechanisms will be\ndesigned for extension services responsive to diverse cultural and gender needs. Recognizing\nthe role of plantations in rehabilitating degraded forest land and as a means for stabilizing\nshifting  cultivation,  the  project  design  will  incorporate  monitoring  systems  to  measure  the\nbenefits and impacts.\nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $824,000 equivalent, comprising $527,000 in\nforeign  exchange  and  $297,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has\nrequested ADB to provide $700,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of\n$527,000 and $173,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB\non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The\nGovernment will contribute the remaining $124,000 equivalent in kind through the provision of\nexperienced counterpart staff, office space in Vientiane, information, data, administrative and\nclerical services, local transport, communications facilities, and other inputs. Details are given in\nAppendix 1.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n17.
