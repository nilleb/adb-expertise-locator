THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the Madhya Pradesh Irrigation Efficiency Improvement Project. \n2.  The project is designed to support higher irrigation efficiency and expansion of irrigation \nin Madhya Pradesh. It will focus on developing 125,000 hectares (ha) of new, highly efficient and \nclimate-resilient irrigation networks and productive command area under the Kundalia Irrigation \nProject (KIP). It will also finance a feasibility study and detailed designs for modernizing the \nexisting Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation Project (SSIP).1   \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  India requires irrigation water use efficiency and productivity improvement. Water \nplays a critical role in India\u2019s food security and welfare of the rural poor as 84% of all water \nwithdrawals are dedicated to agriculture and 42% of all agricultural land is irrigated. India benefits \nfrom only 4% of the world\u2019s renewable fresh water but has 16% of the world\u2019s population.2 With \nintense urbanization and industrialization, the need for water from the nonagriculture sector is fast \nincreasing and water shortage is becoming a major concern for industries. At the same time, \npopulation growth and change in dietary habits require continued growth in agricultural production. \nBy 2050, annual water availability per capita in India is expected to drop from 1,530 cubic meters \nto 1,140 cubic meters, indicating severe water stress.3 The current average irrigation water use \nefficiency of 38% points towards the need for serious performance improvement in this sector.4 \nThe productivity of irrigation water is further hampered by low crop yields and cultivation of low- \nvalue  crops. Therefore,  most  of  India\u2019s  utilized  water  not  only  supports  activities  with  low \neconomic value but is also inefficiently used. In the meantime, water shortages are constraining \nwater-dependent power production and the development of high-value industries that are required \nto fuel the country\u2019s economic growth. These problems will worsen in the future with the projected \nimpacts of population and economic growth, and with climate change, which will increase both \nirrigation water demand and uncertainty around the reliability of water resources.  \n4.  Irrigation  modernization  is  a  key  strategy  to  reducing  water  wastage.  The \nGovernment of India recognizes the situation. Both the Three Year Action Agenda (2017\u20132018 to \n2019\u20132020)5 and the 2015 Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana program have acknowledged \nthe necessity to improve water use efficiency in irrigation.6 In 2014, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) funded the Scoping Study for a National Water Use Efficiency Improvement Support \nProgram.7 The study identified the following three main causes for low water use efficiency: \n(i) inadequate  irrigation  and  drainage  infrastructure  because  of  faulty  designs  and  lack  of \nmaintenance; (ii) inadequate management, operation and maintenance (MOM) of the irrigation \nsystems; and (iii) inadequate capacity building and training services. The study highlights the \nneed to modernize the design and management of major- and medium-sized irrigation (MMI) \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Madhya Pradesh \nIrrigation Efficiency Improvement Project (TA 9051-IND).  \n2  T.

It proposed a framework for assessing and improving water use efficiency on MMI \nschemes. Under a subsequent regional technical assistance, the framework was successfully \npilot tested on such schemes within South Asia. The study also developed comprehensive \nmodernization strategies for existing irrigation systems and recommended a tailored investment \nplan for the SSIP.8   \n5.  Madhya  Pradesh  plan  to  expand  and  modernize  irrigation.  Since  2010,  the \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  has  embarked  on  an  ambitious  irrigation  expansion  and \nmodernization  plan.  New  developments,  infrastructure  modernization  and  substantial \nmanagement and operation improvement led to an increase in net irrigation area from 0.85 million \nha in 2006 to 3.6 million ha in 2017\u20132018. These efforts have been rewarded by record annual \nagricultural growth of 20% in 2013\u20132016. The state plans to further increase the total irrigated \narea to 7.2 million ha by 2025. This will be achieved by maximizing irrigation efficiency and water \nproductivity in both new and existing irrigation systems. It includes development of pressurized \nirrigation, adoption of micro-irrigation and production of high-value crops. The state has set the \nambitious target of developing pressurized irrigation in 80% of all irrigated areas by 2025. The \nplan is estimated to cost $20 billion. \n6.  The Water  Resources Department  Madhya  Pradesh (MPWRD)  has requested  ADB \nassistance to help finance this plan and, more importantly, to provide advice on developing highly \nefficient  and  sustainable  model  for  MMI  schemes  that  will  serve  as  reference  for  future \nmodernization investments. The KIP will include the design and construction of a highly efficient \nand productive new pressurized irrigation system with automated volumetric control for efficient, \nreliable and flexible water delivery services. The KIP will be supplied by the reservoir being built \nunder the Kundalia Major Multipurpose Project (KMMP). Modernization being conducted under \nthe SSIP will include (i) upgrading infrastructure to improve conveyance efficiency and flow \nregulation, and (ii) extending the command area and partially converting to pressurized irrigation \nand micro-irrigation.9  \n7.  Innovation and ADB value addition. The project supports both technical and institutional \ninnovations. The technical innovation involves designing and constructing a very large scale \npressurized and automated irrigation system that will allow considerable gains in water use \nefficiency. On  the  institutional  side,  the  project  introduces  the  design\u2013build\u2013operate (DBO) \ncontracting modality. There are very few examples of irrigation DBO contracts in India and none \non such large systems and with such a long MOM period. The DBO approach addresses critical \nlessons from past projects. It aims to address recurrent public sector inefficiencies in irrigation \nMOM. The DBO modality will also substantially enhance irrigation service delivery to farmers and \nencourage contractors to build quality and efficient irrigation systems to reduce MOM costs. Value \nadded by ADB assistance consists of providing state of the art technical support for designing the \nKIP and SSIP, supervising KIP construction, MOM and agriculture support services, preparing \nDBO bidding documents and providing support for efficient management of the DBO contracts. \nThe current limited expertise of MPWRD with pressurized irrigation, irrigation modernization and \nperformance-based irrigation management will be substantially enhanced through the project. \n8.  The project is consistent with the objectives of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u2013\n2022 for India.10 It will support the country\u2019s Three Year Action Agenda (2017\u20132018 to 2019\u2013\n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) Indian farmers\u2019 income doubled by \n2022 (footnote 5); (ii) India\u2019s \u201cmore crop per drop\u201d achieved (footnote 6); and (iii) resilience of \nfarmers in the project area to ongoing and uncertain future climate change increased.11 The \nproject will have the following outcome: higher irrigation efficiency, agricultural water productivity \nand climate resilience in Madhya Pradesh achieved.12     \nC.  Outputs  \n10.  Output 1: Kundalia Irrigation Project infrastructure constructed. The KIP will consist \nof two large pumping stations pumping water to distribution chambers from where water will be \ndistributed by gravity pressure through a network of buried pipelines that gradually reduce in size \nup to end user and/or farm outlets (hydrants every 1\u20132 ha). The system is designed to provide \npressure of 200 kilopascal at the outlet for field micro-irrigation systems. \n11.  Output  2:  Kundalia  Irrigation  Project  performance-based  operation  and \nmaintenance established. This output will be delivered by contracting a private sector operator \nunder a DBO contract. The contractor will be tasked to operate and maintain the system for a \nperiod of 5 years after completion of the construction. During this period the contractor will need \nto meet several performance indicators related to system leakage, electricity consumption, and \nnoninterruption of operation. The contractor will provide on-the-job training to MPWRD staff. A \nsupervisory control and data acquisition system and a decision support system will be installed to \nfacilitate the MOM of the system.  \n12.  Output 3: Farmers capacity for rapid uptake of micro-irrigation technology in the \nKundalia  Irrigation  Project  command  area  enhanced.  This  output  will  be  achieved  by \n(i) establishing and building the capacity of the water users\u2019 associations, (ii) establishing micro-\nirrigation farm demonstration sites, and (iii) establishing farmers\u2019 service centers and conducting \nfarmers\u2019 field schools to support adoption of micro-irrigation and productive irrigated agriculture \nincluding high-value crops. These activities will be carried out by the DBO contractor(s) in a \ncollaborative  relationship  with  government  agencies  and  stakeholders.  The  DBO  contracts \ninclude performance guarantees for the area equipped with micro-irrigation systems at year 1, 3 \nand 5 after commissioning.  \n13.  Output 4: Modernization of the Sanjay Sarovar Irrigation Project well-designed with \nproject readiness criteria met. This output will be achieved by (i) preparing a comprehensive \nSSIP modernization plan, (ii) undertaking a feasibility study and detailed design of the proposed \nplan, (iii) developing an institutional strategy to enhance the performance and sustainability of \nSSIP MOM, (iv) preparing bidding documents for the modernization works and consultant request \nfor proposal for the ensuing project implementation and construction quality supervision, and \n(v) supporting MPWRD and ADB to meet the project processing requirements. \n   \n                                                \n11  Defined by the project. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nD.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The KMMP includes three main components: (i) the 44.5-meter high Kundalia dam across \nthe Kalisindh River, construction of which will be completed in October 2018 and is being funded \nby the state; (ii) the KIP; and (iii) the supply of water for potable and industrial use. The KIP was \ninitially envisaged to cover 58,000 ha, of which 45,000 ha would have been gravity irrigation with \ncanals and 13,000 ha lift irrigation. In 2015, MPWRD decided to convert the KIP to a 100% \npumped pressurized pipeline system for spray and micro-irrigation.  \n21.  The feasibility design for the pressurized distribution system, including pumping stations, \nelectrical substations and power supply systems, transmission pipelines, valves, controls and \nassociated structures, was planned under the project preparatory technical assistance. Design \ncriteria were selected to allow delivery of reliable and flexible irrigation service with a pressurized \nwater outlet at every 1\u20132 ha. The system was conceived to achieve 80% overall irrigation \nefficiency. With  such  gain  in  efficiency,  the  water  balance  assessment  confirmed  the  KIP \ncommand area can be extended to 125,000 ha to provide full irrigation services in the rabi season \nand protective irrigation in the wet season. Several design options were studied. The best \ncompromise in terms of energy consumption, construction cost and robustness to local conditions \nwas retained as the base design. The power requirement is estimated at 63 megawatts. MPWRD \ninitially  envisaged  building  a  solar  power  plant  as  part  of  the  project  to  offset  the  power \nrequirement of the KIP scheme. However, construction of the plant was deferred as Madhya \nPradesh has a large excess in generation capacity that remains unutilized and for which the state \npays compensation charges to private companies. In addition, the state is finalizing a 750-\nmegawatt public\u2013private partnership project for solar power generation. The KIP design provides \na smart water management system to increase management efficiency and reduce energy \nconsumption. This includes (i) a supervisory control and data acquisition system to monitor and \ncontrol flow remotely throughout the command area, and (ii) a decision support system with an \nirrigation planning and scheduling database to help organize efficient water distribution.  \n22.  The overall climate-related risk associated with the project was rated as high by the \nAWARE rapid climate screening tool, mainly because of high risks associated with temperature \nincrease  (and  related  evapotranspiration  increase),  and  changes  in  rainfall  patterns. \nConsequently, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment was undertaken to analyze this risk \nmore  rigorously  and  assess  the  need  for  and  economic  feasibility  of  potential  adaptation \nmeasures. The assessment confirmed likely increase in irrigation demand in the dry season \nbecause of an increase in temperature. This increase in irrigation water demand can be met \nthrough additional groundwater pumping. The aquifer sustainable yield will only be exceeded \nunder the most pessimistic climate change scenario. In such a case, a 1.5% reduction in area \nplanted with high water-use crops like oranges will be required towards the end of the economic \nlifetime of the project. The climate risk and vulnerability assessment studied the economic \nfeasibility of alternative measures to actively increase the availability of irrigation water. These \nincluded infrastructure investments aiming to increase the supply of irrigation water, and initiatives \nto reduce irrigation water demand from farmers. The only measure considered economically \nfeasible is the provision of agricultural training and field pilot demonstrations to advance the \nplanting time of rabi crops and benefit from residual soil moisture from the monsoon. This \nadditional adaptation measure is included under the project design.  \n ", "7 \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  Economic analysis. An economic analysis was prepared for the entire KMMP.15 The \neconomic net present value (discounted at the assumed economic opportunity cost of capital of \n9%) of the project is estimated at \u20b938.5 billion indicating that the KMMP is economically feasible. \nThe same conclusion can be derived from the project\u2019s economic internal rate of return (EIRR), \nwhich is estimated at 15.7%, well above the minimum required rate of 9.0%. Increased agricultural \nproduction is the most important source of quantifiable economic benefits, accounting for over \n95% of total benefits. The development of irrigation will support change in cropping patterns from \nlow-value crops towards high-value crops such as vegetables and oranges. It will support an \nincrease in cropping intensity from 132% to 180%, thereby extending the harvested area by \n59,500 ha. More importantly, sufficient and reliable irrigation supply will boost yields by 10%\u2013 \n50% depending on crop type. Benefits from increased raw water provision accounts for the \nremainder.   \n24.  Sensitivity tests were conducted by varying the project\u2019s investment cost, MOM cost, and \nbenefits. The results of the analysis indicate that the economic feasibility of the KMMP is more \nsensitive to unfavorable changes to economic benefits than to the investment cost. If the benefits \nare 43.8% lower or the investment cost is 127.5% higher than in the base case, the EIRR will fall \nbelow 9.0%. The project\u2019s EIRR is relatively insensitive to changes to the MOM cost. A Monte \nCarlo simulation indicates that the EIRR has a negligible likelihood of dropping below the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital, even if benefits would be 50% lower and costs 50% higher \nthan in the base case.16 \n25.  Financial analysis. MPWRD is considering a gradual increase in the current tariff for \npressurized irrigation from \u20b91,000 to \u20b910,900 (in constant October 2017 prices, per ha per year). \nAt this much higher tariff, the financial internal rate of return of the KMMP is estimated at \u20135.7%, \nwhich is lower than the weighted average cost of capital (2.2%). This is mainly because the \nproposed  incremental  tariff  does  not  include  repayment  of  the  capital  costs.  For  projects \nimplemented by government sector units such as MPWRD, the financial analysis focuses on the \ncapacity to finance the incremental recurrent costs which are required for the sustainability of the \ninvestment. Despite the low financial internal rate of return the project is worth supporting based \non the large economic development benefits as indicated by the high estimated EIRR, the positive \nimpact on the state economy, and the substantial positive effect on reducing rural poverty in the \nKIP command area.  \n26.  The proposed tariff was set to cover the full cost of routine MOM by 2026.  MPWRD would \nonly need to subsidize the MOM expenditure during 2021\u20132025 (about \u20b91.2 billion in total for the \n5-year period) and in 2050, the year in which hydraulic steel structures and mechanical equipment \nwill be replaced (about \u20b93.9 billion). A review of MPWRD MOM annual budgets has indicated that \nMPWRD would be able to cover these costs.  The state government has committed to adopt the \nappropriate tariff scheme and to cover for any MOM budget shortfalls. This has been included as \na loan covenant. \nC.  Governance \n27.  Financial management. A financial management assessment of MPWRD was carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.17 The overall risk assessment for the project is moderate. MPWRD has experience in \n                                                \n15 Because the construction of the dam is needed to realize the economic benefits of the pipeline network and \npressurized distribution system, the economic analysis covered the entire KMMP, and not only the component that \nwill be cofinanced by ADB. \n16 A Monte Carlo simulation is a mathematical technique that generates random variables for modelling risk or \nuncertainty of a certain system. \n17 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nimplementing  World  Bank  projects,  but  none  on  ADB  accounting  requirements  and  loan \ndisbursement procedures. Hence, MPWRD will appoint experienced accounting staff to the \nproject. A financial management consultant will be provided under the project to prepare a \ndetailed procedure manual and undertake trainings on ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines. MPWRD \nwill recruit independent audit firms to undertake periodical internal audits of the project accounts. \nThe project accounts will be audited annually by the state Controller and General Auditor.  \n28.  Procurement. MPWRD organized consultation workshops and a roadshow during the \nproject design to appraise private sector interest and capacity to undertake DBO contracts \nincluding agriculture support services. The procurement of goods and works will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). All recruitment of consultants will \nfollow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A \nprocurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is \nmoderate. International and national procurement specialists were provided as part of the project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  to  prepare  the  two  DBO  bidding  documents,  support  the \nevaluation process and assist with the consultants\u2019 recruitment. Funds were allocated in the \nproject to provide procurement training to the implementing agency. In addition, India Resident \nMission trained MPWRD staff on ADB\u2019s procurement and consultant recruitment guidelines. \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  MPWRD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 13). \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n30.  Over 40% of the population in the KIP\u2019s future cultivable command area depends on \nagriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  Wheat  and  soybeans  are  the  two  main  crops  followed  by \nchickpeas (pulses), spices, oranges, and vegetables. While agricultural growth has substantially \nincreased in the state over the last 5 years, it has stagnated in the project area because of a lack \nof irrigation development. The KIP is expected to improve farmers\u2019 net incomes and directly \nbenefit about 838,262 people in 419 villages in Rajgarh and Agar Malwa districts of Madhya \nPradesh. In general, it will also provide economic opportunities to improve nonfarm rural incomes, \nand this will indirectly contribute to development and poverty reduction. The project poverty impact \nratio was estimated at 30.1%. This represents the proportion of the net economic benefits \ndesigned to go to the poor compared to total project net economic benefits. The project is \nclassified as having some gender elements, where women will benefit from skills training for \nfarmers in improved agricultural practices using the new irrigation systems. \n31.  The contractors will be required to strictly implement government requirements regarding \nhealth and safety of men and women who work at the construction sites. The contractors, in close \ncoordination with the project management unit, will conduct awareness programs on prevention \nof sexually transmitted diseases and drug use. The contractor will be required to strictly implement \nequal pay for female and male workers.  \nE.  Safeguards \n32.  In  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  (SPS),  the  project\u2019s \nsafeguard categories are as follows.18 \n33.  Environment (category B). The initial environmental examination including its EMP has \nbeen prepared. The project\u2019s initial environmental examination identified that most impacts\u2014such \nas noise, dust, impacts on vegetation because of land clearing and excavation\u2014occur during the \nconstruction periods. Mitigation measures were included accordingly in the EMP. Stakeholders \nhave been consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation. A grievance \n                                                \n18  ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n ", "9 \nredress mechanism to address both social and environmental issues will be established prior to \nproject implementation.  \n34.  Involuntary Resettlement (category B). Permanent land acquisition is limited for the \npumping stations and distribution chambers. Most land acquisition will be temporary for laying the \nirrigation pipelines underground and this will affect land owners during construction. Two sample \nresettlement plans (land acquisition plans) were prepared. One resettlement plan was prepared \nfor distribution pipes covering 500 ha of cultivable command area that will affect 96 households \nand requires 4.81 ha of land (4.78 ha of temporary acquisition, and 0.03 ha of permanent \nacquisition). The second resettlement plan was prepared for installing a pumping station, which \nwill affect 25 households and require 31.14 ha of land, 2.21 ha of which is private land. For the \nrest of the project areas, the DBO contractors will prepare the resettlement plan(s) in accordance \nwith the project\u2019s resettlement framework. The resettlement framework for this project was \nprepared to guide the preparation of the resettlement plan(s) during project implementation. The \nsample resettlement plans and resettlement framework were prepared in accordance with the \nADB SPS, Madhya Pradesh Pipeline Act (2013), the Madhya Pradesh Consent Land Purchase \nPolicy  (2014),  and  the  Indian  land  legislation  on  The  Right  to  Fair  Compensation  and \nTransparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act (2013).   \n35.  Resettlement plans prepared by the DBO contractor will be reviewed and cleared by ADB. \nMPWRD  has  adequate  capacity  to  implement  the  resettlement  plan  and  environmental \nsafeguards,  since  it  is  currently  implementing  projects  with  significant  resettlement  and \nenvironmental  concerns.  The  grievance  redress  mechanism  that  has  been  established  for \nMPWRD\u2019s current project will also be established for this ADB-funded project. \n36.  Indigenous Peoples (category C). There are no indigenous peoples, as defined by the \nADB SPS in the project-affected areas.  \n37.   Associated facility. The water required for the irrigation network constructed under the \nproposed project will be supplied from the KMMP reservoir. Therefore, the KMMP reservoir is \nconsidered as an associated facility. Due diligence was undertaken to assess the suitability of \nmeasures undertaken under the KMMP in addressing the environmental impacts. The due \ndiligence found that the KMMP planning and construction followed the guidance provided in the \nenvironmental impact assessment and EMP that was approved by Ministry of Environment, \nForest, and Climate Change in January 2015. The environmental impact assessment and EMP \nfor the KMMP has comprehensively addressed its environmental impacts and is in line with ADB \nSPS requirements. MPWRD has allocated adequate resources to implement the EMP and other \nassociated plans. Therefore, no corrective action or additional actions need to be adopted under \nthe KMMP. \nF.  Summary of Risks Assessment and Risk Management Plan  \n38.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.19  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nBenefits of the project will be reduced if water  The DBO contractor will be tasked to provide farmers support \nmanagement  is  not  improved  and  if  a  services including WUA strengthening and extensive agricultural \nsignificant majority of the farmers do not adopt  support  program  component,  with  field  demonstrations  and \nmicro-irrigation.  experiential training.
