The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a loan of $250 million from its ordinary\ncapital  resources  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Industrial  Corridor  Development  Program.  The\nproposed program consisting of 2 subprograms will strengthen the enabling environment for\neffective implementation of the Government of India\u2019s National Industrial Corridor Development\nProgram, which aims to increase the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, strengthen\nnational supply chains and links with regional and global value chains, and create jobs.\n2. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry, acting through the Department for Promotion of\nIndustry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), is the executing agency for the program. The National\nIndustrial Corridor Development and Implementation Trust (NICDIT) is the implementing agency\nalong with its knowledge partner, the National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation\nLimited (NICDCL). The TA project will strengthen the technical and policy advisory, human\nresources, and program management capacity of NICDCL. ADB designed the policy matrix based\non gaps identified in the industrial operating ecosystem. Policy actions are included to ensure\nsynergy between the industrial corridor development program and the reform agenda of India.1\n3. India\u2019s low competitiveness in manufacturing is reflected in the declining contribution of\nmanufacturing to gross domestic product, India's low share of world manufacturing exports (less\nthan 2.5%), and a limited number of workers employed by manufacturing firms with 10 or more\nworkers  (just  17.1  million  workers  in  2015\u20132016).  Key  factors  impacting  manufacturing\ncompetitiveness include an inadequate institutional environment for coordination between central\nand state agencies, which impedes smooth decision-making and implementation of reforms;\ncumbersome business processes and high cost of capital;2 challenges in infrastructure, especially\nlack of integrated multimodal transport networks leading to high logistics costs;3 bottlenecks in\nland availability; rigidities in labor regulation;4 paucity of industry-aligned skilled workforce;5 and\nabsence of long-term financing for private investment.6\n4. The government has identified industrial corridors as an appropriate policy tool to lower\ntransaction and logistics costs and improve efficiency while targeting large areas of the country\nthat are earmarked for industrial development. Transaction and logistics costs are high because\nof weaknesses in transport infrastructure, especially last-mile connectivity to ports and railways.\nUnsynchronized  economic  and  spatial  planning  have failed  to  yield urban\u2013industry  linkage\nbenefits to firms and workers.

Upgrading skills in the local labor force is required to improve \nproductivity  in  industrial  corridors\u2014a  prerequisite  for  attracting  private  sector  investment. \nDevelopment of industrial corridors will require a strong apex institutional and regulatory structure \nto target specific locations where multiple constraints can be addressed through coordinated \nplanning between national and subnational governments and to promote trade and regional \nintegration spanning central, state, and local agencies.  \n \n5.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  facility  will  provide  capacity-building  and \nadvisory services to support reforms under subprogram 2 of the Industrial Corridor Development \nProgram. The TA complements the proposed program objective of strengthening the enabling \nenvironment for national industrial corridor development, and under subprogram 2 will advance \nthe mandates of institutions constituted by the government to develop national industrial corridors. \nThe TA will provide advisory support to strengthen the capacity of these institutions in developing \nrobust planning guidelines and technical, institutional, and regulatory frameworks, particularly in \nthe special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in the states. The transaction TA for Knowledge Services for \nIndustrial Corridor Development Program is listed in the country operations business plan for India, \n2021\u20132023.7 \n \n6.   NICDIT was set up under DPIIT in 2016. NICDIT will invest based on delegated authority \nfrom DPIIT in industrial corridors and clusters in partnership with state-level SPVs. NICDCL, \nformerly Delhi\u2013Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation, was formed in February \n2020 to operationalize industrial corridors and act as a knowledge partner for NICDIT and provide \nadvisory services to states. NICDCL is mandated to undertake extensive project development \nactivities  across  all  investment  regions  and  industrial  areas,  assist  state  governments  in \ndeveloping master plans for industrial corridors, and provide them with technical and financial \nstructuring and corridor planning guidance. However, the new institutions require expanded \ncapacity and enhanced knowledge services to be more effective. Given this, the objective of \nsubprogram 1 will be to establish the institutional structure and strengthen it with guidelines and \nframeworks on providing knowledge services within industrial corridors, developing skills, and \ncreating opportunities for private sector engagement., while subprogram 2 will advance the \nmandates of the new institutions. \n \n7.  The proposed transaction TA will support government initiatives under subprogram 2. The \nTA project will provide advisory services under the three program reform areas (paras. 9\u201311). The \nTA will support development of NICDCL, NICDIT, and SPVs identified by NICDCL. The TA will \nalso support NICDIT and NICDCL to develop new policy guidelines and financing modalities, \nconcession  agreements,  and  national  gender-inclusive  policy  frameworks  for  corridor-wide \noperationalization.  The  TA  will  support  the  delivery  of  11  out  of  13  policy  actions  under \nsubprogram 2.8 The following consulting services packages will be recruited through the TA \nfacility: \n(i)  two individual consultants with intermittent inputs (proposed for October 2021\u2013\nSeptember 2023): \n(a)  investment promotion specialist (international, 200 person-days); and \n(b)  finance specialist (international, 200 person-days); and  \n \n7  ADB 2020.
