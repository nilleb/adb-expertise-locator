INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Supreme People\u2019s \nCourt (SPC) to design and build a big data system for judicial reform, which will improve the \nexisting  data  system,  provide  statistical  data  on  judicial  reform  more  effectively  and \ncomprehensively, and facilitate in-depth analysis of judicial data and the application of this \nanalysis to court reform needs. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan, 2017\u20132019 for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Government of the PRC recognizes that a well-functioning economy needs supporting \nlaws and the institutions to administer these laws fairly, consistently, and transparently. The PRC \nhas made enormous strides in developing a generally complete and coherent body of laws and a \nwell-functioning national court system. Both the system of laws and regulations and the court \nsystem  are  now  comprehensive  and  increasingly  professionalized,  though  there  remain \nsignificant discrepancies in quality of law enforcement among local courts. The courts are \ncurrently engaged in their fourth 5-year reform program, which includes the establishment of (i) \nthe circuit courts of the SPC and trans-regional people\u2019s courts, and (ii) other structural design \nelements that aim to minimize external influence over court decisions and to enhance compliance \nwith court orders. \n \n4.  Previous PRC court reforms have included computerization and networking of court \nrecords, which has vastly increased public transparency of court decisions. Most or all courts now \nhave networked information technology systems that allow the publication and sharing of data. \nHowever, the SPC has found that the courts' data collection system is not well designed for \nevaluating the performance of the court system or assessing the impact of reforms on the \nprofessionalization of the judiciary. The system generates overall numbers of cases resolved by \ncourts in certain categories, but does not provide for per-judge breakdowns of data, nor does it \nassist the SPC to assess the quality of case resolutions. The SPC is aware that the quality of \njudicial  performance  cannot  be  determined  solely  by  numbers  of  cases  resolved;  indeed, \nnumerical case resolution targets had adverse side effects, with some courts dismissing cases, \nforcing settlements, or deciding cases summarily to meet numerical targets. Current statistical \ndata is also inadequate for helping the SPC plan for and allocate resources, particularly judges, \namong courts. To address these concerns, the SPC is hoping to benefit from international \nexpertise  in  assessing  per-judge  performance  in  a  sophisticated  system  that  combines \nquantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, courts in Australia and the United States have \nexperience with online systems for judicial performance review. \n \n5.  PRC courts have also undertaken reforms intended to improve the case acceptance \nsystem to ensure that difficult cases are not refused, whether for reasons of local influence or to \nimprove case resolution percentages. However, the existing data collection and analysis system \ndoes not allow for analyses that would help the SPC determine whether the subsequent increase \nin caseloads is a result of the reforms or caused by extraneous factors. Further reforms have \naimed to minimize local government interference, and the SPC is hoping to use more sensitive \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: PRC, 2017\u20132019. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 December 2017. \n ", "2 \ndata collection and analysis to determine what kinds of cases attract interference and to assess \nwhether the reforms are working. The SPC hopes that better information on actual judicial \nperformance (rather than simply raw numbers of cases resolved) will help it (i) determine whether \nand how past reforms are working, and (ii) allocate resources to courts where the numbers and \nexpertise  of  particular  judges,  or  further  reform  mechanisms,  are  most  needed.  The  data \ncollection system needs to be designed to give continual feedback to the SPC and senior SPC \nmanagement to assess the impact of system design changes and to support further reform. \n \n6.  The PRC is committed to the ongoing reform of the judicial system. The SPC has \nrequested ADB\u2019s assistance, in the form of expertise from ADB member countries with highly \ndeveloped use of data in their judicial systems, to provide valuable inputs for the SPC to design \nand build a big data system for judicial reform, which will (i) improve the existing data system, (ii) \nprovide statistical data on judicial reform more effectively and comprehensively, (iii) facilitate the \nconduct of in-depth analysis, (iv) support applications to further reforms to the court system, and \n(v) give continual feedback to the SPC and senior SPC management to assess the impact of \nsystem design changes and to support further reform. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: strengthened governance and rule of law. \nThe TA will have the following outcome: improved court data systems used by the SPC to design \nand assess reform initiatives. \n \n8.  The TA will provide expertise from ADB member countries with highly developed use of \ndata in their judicial systems to the SPC to help it develop a system for collection, calculation, \nanalysis, and application of judicial data that will inform judicial reforms designed to enhance \njudicial professionalism, and thereby to improve court services. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Knowledge of the Supreme People\u2019s Court on judicial data collection, \nmethods, and analysis enhanced. The SPC will establish one or more research groups \nincluding representatives of the SPC\u2019s Judicial Statistics Department, Information Technology \nDepartment, and Data Analysis and Application Department, as well as representatives from local \ncourts  and  domestic  experts  and  scholars.  The  SPC  and  research  group(s)  will  host  an \ninternational expert symposium, including foreign and PRC judges and other experts, to address \nkey problems and share their experience in using judicial data to improve court systems. Members \nof the research group(s) will undertake field research in the PRC on courts\u2019 experience in using \nthe existing court data system. \n \n10.  Output 2: Observations and conclusions from field research in one or more Asian \nDevelopment Bank member countries compiled and documented. The SPC will undertake \nresearch on the use of judicial data systems in judicial reform and management in at least one \nother ADB member country (preferably two, budget and time permitting) to understand the design \nand use by judges and court management of their judicial data systems, considering options, \nproblems, and lessons learned. \n \n11.  Output 3: Recommendations from research group(s) on the design of the Supreme \nPeople\u2019s Court\u2019s data collection and analysis of the impacts of judicial reform initiatives \n ", "3 \nprepared.  Based  on  the  domestic  and  international  research  and  information  exchanges \nconducted under outputs 1 and 2, the SPC\u2019s research group(s) will compile a joint report, with \ninput from the international experts provided under output 1, making recommendations on \nimprovements to PRC court data collection, analysis, and feedback systems that will assist the \nSPC to better design further reform initiatives and evaluate their effectiveness. \n \n12.  Output 4: Handbook on judicial reform data systems published in Chinese for use \nin courts of the People\u2019s Republic of China  and in English for international judicial \nexchanges. The handbook will include papers delivered at the international expert symposium \nand the findings and recommendations of the research group(s). The handbook will be in Chinese \nfor use by PRC judges, officials, and scholars, and in English for dissemination of the PRC\u2019s court \nmanagement  development  knowledge  and  experience  to  other  ADB  developing  member \ncountries. Digital publication will be encouraged. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  convening  and \nmanagement  of  domestic  research  groups,  provision  of  meeting  space,  counterpart  staff, \nassistance with arrangements for consultants and resource persons, translation, assistance in \narranging meetings, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s PRC Resident Mission, including outposted staff from \nthe Office of the General Counsel, will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and organize \nmeetings \n \n16.
