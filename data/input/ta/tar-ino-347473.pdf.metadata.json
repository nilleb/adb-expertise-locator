The Asian Development (ADB) fielded a Reconnaissance Mission in February 2004 to \nformulate technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare a project to support the housing sector in \nIndonesia, in particular to revitalize the public and private sector institutions so as to meet the \nburgeoning unsatisfied demand for housing, particularly for the low income and poor segments \nof the community.2 A Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in April 2004. The objectives, scope, cost \nestimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA \nare  based  on  the  understanding  reached  with  the  Government  during  the  Mission.  The \npreliminary project framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  With the population of Indonesia expected to have reached 212 million inhabitants in the \nyear 2003, and an urbanization rate of 43%, some 91 million people are living in Indonesian \ncities. The rate of urbanization continues apace with the growing urban economies. Demand for \nhousing, land, and infrastructure is increasing rapidly and most urban areas in Indonesia cannot \nprovide  the  required  public  facilities,  physical  infrastructure,  and  social  services.  The \nGovernment currently estimates a shortfall of 6 million houses. \n \n3.  Crucial to success in delivering affordable shelter to the poor and low-income groups is \nthe development of systems to consolidate and develop land and to finance this process. In \nparticular,  two  segments3  of  the  market  must  be  served  to  effectively  address  demand, \nespecially the demand of the poor. These segments are inner city renewal and peripheral urban \ndevelopment. Inner cities are congested with high density concentrations of low-quality housing \ninterspersed with large areas of vacant (cleared) land. If the quality of life of residents in these \npoor areas is to be improved, it will be necessary to develop new inclusive methodologies of \nurban renewal, addressing key issues of land consolidation, provision of rental accommodation, \nand public/ private financing of redevelopment. Inefficient peripheral development has also been \ngenerated by an inability to consolidate land. Many large-scale housing areas have been built \nand located in the surrounding areas of metropolitan and big cities, but the area of land actually \ndeveloped is usually much less than the land permit allows. The transactions costs involved \nhave resulted in severe undersupply of housing. Financing for such activities is constrained by \npast problems that financial institutions encountered in the sector and the inability of lenders, \ndespite  considerable  liquidity  in  the  financial  markets,  to  take  longer-term  perspectives  on \nassets and to develop housing finance products accessible to the poor. The structural problems \nhave severely restricted supply, causing rising prices for substandard accommodation and \npricing the poor out of the urban housing market.  \n \n4.  The Government recognizes the importance of addressing the housing needs of the \npoor majority and has established the Directorate General of Housing and Settlements (DGHS) \nwithin  the  Ministry  of  Settlements  and  Regional  Infrastructure  (MSRI)  to  oversee  the \ndevelopment and implementation of a national shelter policy. Clear objectives in respect of \nurban shelter, focused on meeting the needs of the poor for improved housing and more \naccessible housing finance, are set out in the National Development Program (PROPENAS) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet) on 20 May 2004. \n2  \u201cUrban center\u201d in this paper refers generally to built-up areas that could be in municipalities (kota) or regencies \n(kabupaten). Kota and kabupaten are referred to as districts in the Indonesian context. \n3  Slum dwellers, another generally lower income market segment, are addressed under ADB. 2003. Report and \nRecommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to Indonesia for the Neighborhood \nUpgrading and Shelter Sector Project (Loan 2072/73-INO). Manila.  ", "2 \nand in the detailed policy prepared by the DGHS. To control urban sprawl and promote urban \ndevelopment in a planned manner, the Government enacted law No. 4/1992 on housing and \nhuman settlements. The law was followed by Government Regulation No. 80/1999, which set \nforth a new urban and housing development approach of KASIBA (ready-to-build area) and \nLISIBA (stand-alone ready-to-build area). The law facilitates land consolidation and empowers \nlocal governments to (i) formalize development, (ii) achieve well-planned and serviced urban \nareas, and (iii) capture the increase in land values so as to recover the cost of neighborhood \ninfrastructure  and  facilities  and  also  to  make  cross-subsidized  housing  for  low-income \nhouseholds. The difficulty is that implementation mechanisms, revolving as they do around a \nlocal development corporation that would coordinate the land acquisition and development \nissues, lack organizational form,4 finance, and capacity.5 While the National Urban Development \nCorporation (PERUMNAS) has the expertise to undertake such development activity, it is poorly \ncapitalized and lacks the authority to consolidate land for development. On the demand side, \nthere is a lack of affordable bridging finance for developers, end finance for lower income \nhouseholds, and wholesale mechanisms to address the asset maturity problems referred to \nabove. In addition, it is important that livelihood issues of the poor be addressed and the role of \nmicrocredit in this process be further assessed in the light of pilot schemes being undertaken by \nboth national and local governments.6 \n \n5.  The Government7 has identified key institutional constraints to revitalizing the housing \nmarket. These are particularly important in the context of the Government\u2019s recently announced \nMillion Houses Program and its commitment to fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals, \nparticularly those relating to slum improvement and water supply, which require significantly \nincreased delivery of better housing. On the supply side, the local government, PERUMNAS, \nand the private sector must have clear roles and their planning, financial, and human capacity to \nfulfill these roles must be strengthened.  On the demand side, new lines of credit are required in \nparticular bridge finance for development and end finance that is easily accessible to lower \nincome households. In this context, the Government has requested assistance to prepare a \nproject for the housing sector to finance urban renewal activity focused on operationalization of \nKASIBA/LISIBA  activity  to  establish  a  sustainable  housing  and  infrastructure  development \nsystem. The Project is proposed to strengthen mechanisms and institutions on both supply and \ndemand  sides,  specifically  local  urban  development  corporations  and  financial  institutions \ncatering to the finance needs of the poor; and will include significant capacity building so that \nproposed institutional arrangements can be implemented effectively.  \n \n6.  These  market  segments  have  not  received  external  assistance  since  World  Bank \nhousing projects ended in the 1970s. External assistance in housing finance systems has been \nprovided  by  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development  (USAID),  in  the  initial \nassessment of the viability of a secondary mortgage facility (SMF), and the World Bank will \nprovide some assistance in assessing financing options in the sector as a whole, particularly the \ninvolvement of the private sector.8 Lessons learned from these activities, from government \nprojects,  and  from  international  experience  show  the  need  to  establish  transparent  and \nconsultative mechanisms for site consolidation, reblocking, planning, and development; carefully \nconsider  sequencing  of  development  including  temporary  relocation  if  needed;  harness \nefficiencies of the private sector in development and finance; include local governments from \n                                                 \n4 Local development corporations are newly formed and only one, PT Palembang Metropolis, is focusing on urban \ndevelopment issues. \n5 Few local government staff are experienced in housing development. \n6 For example, Comprehensive Kampung Improvement Projects implemented in Surabaya. \n7 Detailed discussions were held with BAPPENAS and DGHS. \n8 Technical Assistance in Housing Policy Reform. \n   ", "3 \nthe beginning of the process and provide project financing for infrastructure and other costs of \nproject preparation; and ensure appropriate targeted subsidy and end finance are available to \nthe beneficiaries. Examples of successful land consolidation and land sharing projects may be \nfound in India Japan, Philippines and Thailand. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will help the Government identify and prepare a project for (i) mobilizing funds \nfor urban development and new housing utilizing the KASIBA/ LISIBA approach through a \npartnership among the government, the private sector, and the community; (ii) providing the \ndevelopment  infrastructure  related  to  such  urban  development;  and  (iii)  strengthening  the \ncapacity  of  local  and  public  enterprises  to  develop  a  planning  process  for  housing  and \ninfrastructure provision and to operationalize KASIBA/LISIBA. The TA will design improved \nsystems for delivering houses for ownership and rental throughout Indonesia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  preparing  each  Project  component  and  is \nstructured to specifically address them. The TA will analyze the housing issues and prepare \nsubproject appraisal reports (SPARs) in six pilot local government areas chosen competitively \non the basis of their demonstrated commitment to operationalize the KASIBA/LISIBA approach, \ntheir commitment to addressing the housing needs of the poor in a transparent and accountable \nmanner, participation from local stakeholders, and demonstrated need. \n \n9.  Part  A:  Supply-Side  Analysis.  The  TA  will  review  Indonesian  and  international \nexperience in delivery systems for housing affordable to the poor and low-income groups as \nwell as rental housing to those groups. It will define the role and legal basis of the local \ngovernment housing section and the local development corporation in catalyzing urban renewal \nactivity catering to all segments of the market, including rental market segments. The TA will \nassess the potential of DGHS to support the development of such a role. The role of, and \nincentives for, private sector participation will also be assessed. It will define the role of the local \nLand Office in this process. The TA will also define the role and legal basis of the local \ndevelopment corporation in respect to land consolidation and development, and the potential for \nPERUMNAS to support the development of such a role. In the pilot local governments, the TA \nwill strengthen or assist the local government to establish a local development corporation; \nundertake stakeholder information campaigns and consultations; prepare a shelter plan; identify \nurban development and land consolidation projects comprising a SPAR, which may be financed \nunder the Project; and start preparing one sample project. It will define the role of and identify \nparticipating  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs).  The  TA  will  also  determine  the \nrequirements for implementing this part of the Project through a sector project. \n \n10.  Part  B:  Demand-Side  Analysis.  Part  B  will  review  Indonesian  and  international \nexperience, and assess the capacity of national, regional, and local financial institutions to \nchannel finance for development of infrastructure, housing development, and end finance for \npurchase, focusing on access for the poor and low-income groups. This activity will design \ndecentralized systems of finance for local governments, the private sector, and community \norganizations; review existing subsidy mechanisms, and recommend improvements to those \nmechanisms; and propose sustainable subsidy mechanisms for the Project. Part B will define \nthe role and legal basis of national and local financial institutions in respect of sustainable \n   ", "4 \nproject and end financing, and the potential of DGHS to support the development of such a role. \nIt will recommend actions required to strengthen the mortgage finance system including the use \nof credit insurance, and mechanisms of long-term funds mobilization including development of \nwholesale markets in general and of the requirements for a viable secondary mortgage facility in \nparticular. In addition, the TA will determine the most effective systems for promoting access to \nfinancing for livelihood development in poor communities improved under the Project; establish \nor strengthen community initiatives and local financial institutions in local governments where \npilot projects have been undertaken in part A of the Project; define the role of and identify \nparticipating NGOs; and determine the requirements for upscaling this part of the Project and \nthe role of ADB in supporting mobilization of the required finance. \n \n11.  Part  C:  Strengthening  National,  Regional,  and  Local  Systems  for  Planning, \nRegulation,  and  Oversight  of  Housing  Development  and  Provision  of  Associated \nInfrastructure. After analyzing of supply and demand trends in the various segments of the \nhousing markets, the TA will develop a policy matrix for implementing effective approaches to \ndecentralized provision of housing and development of infrastructure catering to the needs of \nthe poor and low-income groups by assessing the institutional strengthening needs of the \nbroader shelter sector. In particular, the TA will develop systems to support local development \ncorporations  performing  this  role;  identify  information  systems  needed  to  implement  the \napproach; identify key legislation or regulations required in both supply and finance fields, if any, \nand document key provisions of such in consultation with DGHS and other relevant agencies; \nand assess and cost out the resources required for building systems for all stakeholders to \nimplement this approach and other priority systems (such as sector data collection) through the \nsector project.  \n \n12.  The TA will deliver a fully prepared project, including fully documented SPARs and \nfeasibility assessment of the overall project according to the policies and procedures of ADB. \nThe TA report will provide a detailed policy matrix and project description, including rationale \nand  expected  outcomes,  benefits  and  poverty  impact  analysis;  a  fully  developed  logical \nframework; geographic scope; lending modality and subsidiary loan arrangements, if needed; \nassessment  of  implementing  agencies;  estimates  of  inputs  and  costs;  and  implementation \narrangements and schedule. All subcomponents will be analyzed, as appropriate, for technical, \nfinancial, economic, social, environmental, and institutional viability and sustainability. The TA \nwill  also  undertake  on-the-job  and  formal  training  of  involved  national  agencies  and  local \ngovernment sections so as to facilitate project planning and implementation. This training will \nfocus on urban renewal planning and financing, and on training of trainers in these fields. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million equivalent, comprising $471,000 in \nforeign exchange and $529,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign currency costs and $329,000 \nequivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government \nof the United Kingdom and administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining \nlocal currency costs amounting to $200,000 equivalent, which cover office and support facilities, \ncounterpart staff, administrative support, part of workshop expenses, report production and \ndissemination, and local transportation. Details of the cost estimates and a financing plan are \nshown in Appendix 2. The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n   ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be DGHS of MSRI. A project management unit \n(PMU) to be established within DGHS will organize the technical and administrative aspects of \nthe  TA.  Suitably  qualified  and  experienced  counterpart  staff  will  work  alongside  the  TA \nconsultants. The counterpart staff will work as agreed upon under the direction of the head of \nthe PMU. The TA consultants will fully support the head of the PMU and will work in close \ncollaboration with the counterpart team. The consultant will procure equipment for the TA and \nwill hand this equipment over to DGHS PMU when the final report is submitted. A steering \ncommittee (SC) chaired by BAPPENAS, and comprising senior officials of DGHS, Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), BPN, and Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) will be established to guide and \noversee TA implementation. A working group chaired by DGHS and comprising representatives \nfrom BAPPENAS, MOF, MOHA, and other nominated representatives of regional governments, \nNGOs, and universities will provide counterpart support for the consultants. The SC will meet \nmonthly and the working group biweekly. \n \n15.  The TA will require a minimum input of 21 person-months of international and 60 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services with expertise in shelter upgrading, development, and \nmanagement;  housing  and  microfinance;  municipal  finance;  sociology  and  resettlement; \nproperty law; environmental sciences; and training needs assessment. The consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging \ndomestic  consultants.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. DGHS will be responsible for providing the agreed upon counterpart resources. \nThe consultants will be based in Jakarta and will be expected to travel as necessary to the \nregions. The proposed outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA is expected to begin in August 2004, be implemented over 9 months, and be \ncompleted to stage of final report in April 2005, with intermittent inputs supporting project \nappraisal thereafter. The consultants will produce (i) an inception report at the end of month 1, \n(ii) a phase one strategy report on new shelter development for the poor at the end of month 2, \n(iii) an interim report setting out a detailed implementation strategy for upgrading and new \nshelter development in pilot cities by the end of month 4, (iv) an interim report including SPARs \nat the end of month 6, (v) a draft final report at the end of month 8, and (vi) a final report of a \nsector project and SPARs by the end of month 9. Tripartite reviews will be held after inception, \nat the first interim report, and at the draft final report stage. Corresponding to these reviews, \nstakeholder consultation workshops will be held to present progress to, and obtain input from, \ncentral  government  agencies,  local  governments,  civil  society,  and  representatives  of  the \ncommunities involved. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for \npreparing the Financing Integrated Settlements Development Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n   ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \nEnhanced access of  Upward trend in the  \u2022 National housing survey   \nurban poor and low-  proportion of households  and other surveys of \nincome groups to better  benefiting from new  BPS \nhousing to improve  housing, indicative of   \ntheir lives and  significant improvement  \u2022 DGHS records \ncontribute to achieving  in lives of slum dwellers   \nthe target of MDG 7  (target of MDG 7)  \u2022 RDB records and \n    records of other \nfinancial institutions \nPurpose       \nLocal governments with  \u2022 X number of city  \u2022 National housing survey  Adequate revenue and \nsupport of financial  participatory housing  and other surveys of  willingness to borrow on the \ninstitutions to regularly  projects targeted to the  BPS  part of local governments \ninitiate land  poor and near poor     \nconsolidation projects    \u2022 DGHS records   \ntargeting the poor and  \u2022 X number of    Acceptance of targeted and \nlow-income groups    households benefiting  \u2022 RDB records and  market-friendly subsidy \n  from improved housing  records of other  mechanisms \n \n  financial institutions \n \n\u2022 X number of    \n \nhouseholds benefiting  \u2022 Local government and \n \nfrom improved  NGO records of \n \nenvironmental  development \n. \nconditions   \n  \u2022 Bank Indonesia \n\u2022 Percent increase in the  statistics for financial \namount of project and  institutions \nend finance extended   \nfor low income housing  \u2022 PMU and consultants \nby financial institutions  records \nusing the identified   \nmethodology  \u2022 Surveys undertaken by \n  other stakeholders and \n\u2022 X number of  academic institutions \nparticipating financial \ninstitutions \n \n\u2022 At least X number of \nprofitable shelter \nfinance products \navailable by XX \n \nContinued on next page. \n   ", "Appendix 1  7 \nFRAMEWORK - continued \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nOutputs       \n1.

The consultants will design and prepare an urban shelter project to strengthen the \nsystems of providing and financing low-income housing in Indonesia, including a draft project \nframework and feasibility study. The project activities will be organized under three components: \n(i) a shelter supply component focused on planning and catalyzing the delivery of low-income \nhousing; (ii) a low-income shelter finance component focused on design and initial funding of \nfinancial  systems  for  both  project  and  end  finance  of  beneficiaries  including  low-  income \nmortgages, finance for rental accommodation, and support to wholesale activities in the financial \nmarket linked to housing finance; and (iii) a capacity-building component to institutionalize the \nsystems. The TA will pilot test the approach in six pilot urban centers. The TA will assess the \nabsorptive capacity of local governments to participate in the Project. \n \n2.  The TA will be carried out in two phases. Phase one, which will last for 2 months, will \naddress  general  review,  preparation,  and  planning  issues,  and  will  focus  on  preparing \nassessment reports to be used as background for planning project implementation. Phase two \nwill  last  for  7  months.  The  consultants  will  liaise  with  all  appropriate  agencies  conducting \nactivities in related fields, in particular, UN Habitat, USAID, and World Bank, to ensure that \nactivities are coordinated and efforts are not duplicated.
