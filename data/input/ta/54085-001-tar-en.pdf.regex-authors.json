INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) of the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto advance certain elements of its institutional reform path, as defined in the PRC\u2019s high-quality \ngrowth agenda.1 The request has been made against the backdrop of the requirement for a more \ninnovative, green, inclusive and sustainable development path, and the need to ensure a rapid \nrecovery from adverse socioeconomic impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nSpecifically, the NDRC has requested support in two complementary areas: (i) strengthening \ngovernment performance management and accountability for delivery of basic public services, \nand (ii) improving fair market access and competition. The TA responds to NDRC\u2019s request and \nwill be delivered through a combination of analytical work, policy recommendations, and capacity \ndevelopment activities, including workshops, seminars, and the study of relevant international \nexperience in the two reform areas.    \n \n2.  The  TA  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  operational  priority  on  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.2 The TA was prepared in consultation with the government \nand is based on the latest government priorities relating to institutional reform and post-COVID-\n19 recovery. The TA is included in the list of projects agreed between ADB and the Government \nof the PRC on 22 January 2020.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Throughout  2020,  COVID-19  has  continued  to  spread  globally,  and  containment \nmeasures have greatly disrupted economic activity. As the pandemic persists, the gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in developing Asia is projected to contract by 0.7% in 2020, the first such \ncontraction since the early 1960s. The downturn is broad-based\u2014three-fourths of the region's \neconomies are expected to contract this year. The PRC is an important exception and is projected \nto experience positive growth. Nevertheless, the PRC\u2019s GDP contracted by 6.8% year-on-year in \nthe first quarter (Q1) of 2020, during the peak of its COVID-19 outbreak. Given the sharp \ncontraction in Q1 and an economic recovery that is slower than anticipated, both domestically \nand globally, the PRC\u2019s GDP is now expected to grow by only 1.8% in 2020, the lowest rate since \n1976.4    \n \n4.  The PRC\u2019s one-sided focus on economic growth has lifted millions of people out of poverty \nbut has also come with significant negative side effects. Consequently, the PRC is seeking to \nrebalance its focus on economic growth, in particular to address inequality (geographic, income, \nand non-income); environmental degradation; and fiscal sustainability challenges, which almost \nall subnational governments in the PRC are facing. These ambitions are captured under the high-\nquality growth agenda.5 The need for a rapid post-COVID-19 recovery further strengthens the \nimperative for rapid progress in rebalancing the PRC\u2019s economy toward inclusive, sustainable, \nand green growth.  \n \n1  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2019.

Beijing. \n ", "2 \n5.  According to the NDRC, the delivery of basic public services is currently hindered by \nseveral institutional factors that also constrain a rapid recovery from COVID-19: the need to (i) \nfurther clarify service delivery responsibilities across government tiers (central, provincial and sub-\nprovincial); (ii) strengthen public service delivery accountability arrangements; (iii) consistently \nmonitor service delivery performance across provincial and sub-provincial governments to avoid \nassessment bias; and (iv) in line with the high-quality growth agenda and COVID-19 recovery \nprocess,  introduce  new  dimensions  to  the  performance management framework  related to \ninclusive, green, and environmentally sustainable development. \n \n6.  There is also a need to further strengthen market-oriented development, in particular \nthrough clarifying the optimal relationship between government and the market. Currently, one \nimportant aspect of this relationship is managed through a system centered on a \u201cnegative list for \nmarket  access.\u201d6 This  system  has  evolved  over  time  but  not  succeeded  in  eliminating \nuncertainties surrounding restrictions on investment.  \n \n7.  ADB has a well-established and recent track-record in both reform areas.7 Relevant \nlessons\u2014e.g., related to efficiency improvements in the delivery of public services and the \nimportance of properly disseminating knowledge gained as a result of TA implementation\u2014have \nbeen used as important inputs in the design of the present TA.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: inclusive development strengthened, in line \nwith the PRC high-quality growth agenda (2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development).8 The TA \nwill have the following outcome: selected structural reforms for a sustainable post-COVID-19 \nrecovery  trajectory  improved. 9  The  key  indicator  for  this  outcome  is  a  policy  issuance \nincorporating TA recommendations on service delivery performance management and market \naccess regulation that will be submitted for adoption by NDRC.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Government performance management and accountability strengthened. \nThe TA will support (i) diagnostic studies to inform the establishment of effective mechanisms to \nallocate, measure, and monitor service delivery performance and accountability across all levels \nof  government;  (ii)  comparative  assessments  of  international  experiences  and  sharing  of \ninternational practices on intergovernmental functional and fiscal relations, and performance \nmonitoring of public services; (iii) introduction of performance dimensions supporting green \nrecovery and inclusive and sustainable development; and (iv) capacity development through the \ndesign and delivery of training courses on the implementation of the standardized public service \nmonitoring system, which will be piloted in selected cities and counties.10 \n \n6  A list that defines sectors to which access by market actors is restricted or prohibited. \n7  ADB. 2016.

Output 2: Market access and fair competition improved. The TA will support (i) an \nassessment of PRC market access rules and institutional systems informed by comparative \ninternational experiences, (ii) the sharing of international practices on unified national market \naccess systems and management mechanisms that are of relevance to the PRC, and (iii) \ninternational policy dialogue through forums and seminars on the design and establishment of \nunified rules and institutional systems, for the service industry as a pilot.11 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $650,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n12.  The government will provide in-kind counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other \nin-kind contributions.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional \nCooperation Division of East Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants \nand monitor quality of their work. Arrangements for monitoring and evaluation will be agreed upon \nat the TA inception stage. Individual consultants and resource persons for workshops will be \nrecruited. Disbursements will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, \nas amended from time to time).  \n \n14.
