INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Bangladesh has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide capacity development technical assistance (TA) for enhancing the institutional capacity \nof the Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) under the Ministry of Planning. \nSubsequently, the TA was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Bangladesh.1 \nA fact-finding mission from ADB\u2019s Bangladesh Resident Mission during 14\u201315 September 2014 \nheld discussions with senior officials IMED. This TA is based on the understanding reached \nduring the mission. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Results-based monitoring and evaluation (RBME) is an essential tool for the government \nto measure the quantity and quality of outputs against inputs. RBME also measures the outputs\u2019 \neconomic and social impacts. Effective RBME links public spending with achievement of overall \ndevelopment targets and instills good governance in practices. Many countries have adopted \nthe RBME approach as a strategic performance planning and measurement tool, among them \nBhutan, India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. \n \n3.  The government considers an effective project and program monitoring and evaluation \n(M&E) system essential for the successful implementation of the next national 5-year plan \n(Seventh  Five  Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020).  It  recognizes  RBME  as  the  most  appropriate \nmeans to determine if projects and programs are contributing to achievement of the key national \ngoal of poverty reduction. The Sixth Five Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2015 also emphasized RBME \nfor  achieving  development  goals.  The  government  aims  to  consolidate  a  results-based \napproach to M&E for all projects and programs.3 \n \n4.  RBME  focuses  on the appropriate and  timely  achievement  of goals  and  objectives \nthrough  strategic  planning,  systematic  implementation  and  resource  usage,  and  use  of \nperformance information. It improves policy decision making and program performance at all \nlevels.  \n \n5.  The main focus of the current M&E system in Bangladesh is limited to the tracking of \npublic spending. It primarily monitors implementation progress, identifies reasons for delays, \nand provides recommendations for accelerating project implementation. The current system \nlacks one important aspect of an effective M&E system\u2014measuring the results. Hence, the \nimpacts and outcomes of intended projects and programs are not systematically monitored. \n \n6.  IMED is the government\u2019s apex body responsible for M&E. IMED tracks performance of \npublic investment projects included in the Annual Development Program by collecting and \nanalyzing information on project and program inputs and outputs. IMED reports mainly discuss \nimplementation problems and suggest actions. Thus, M&E of public investment projects merely \ntracks implementation progress, without shedding any light on whether the projects achieve \ntheir ultimate goal of poverty reduction.  \n \n7.  The government is committed to RBME, a systematic approach that is also emphasized \nin the midterm review of the Sixth Five Year Plan. The plan stresses the need to enhance the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2014\u20132016.

Dhaka. \n ", " 2\ncapacity for evidence-based decision making through the use of robust RBME systems, which \nwill facilitate appropriate policy making. In the plan, the government outlined specific steps to \ndevelop an effective RBME and mandated IMED to institutionalize it in all sectors. \n \n8.  The proposed TA builds on the success of two earlier, similar TA projects: Strengthening \nProject  Portfolio  Performance  and  Strengthening  Results-Based  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nProject.4 The first enhanced IMED\u2019s project monitoring capacity by strengthening its project \nmanagement information system (MIS), specifically for ADB\u2019s portfolio in Bangladesh. \n \n9.  The second TA assisted IMED in developing a strategic plan to build capacity for results-\nbased monitoring in all sectors. It also implemented training programs to deepen IMED staff\u2019s \nknowledge in project design, implementation, and monitoring, based on the principles of a \nresults-based  approach.  The  completion  report  for  this  TA  recommended  further  ADB \nassistance in (i) implementing IMED\u2019s strategic plan 2008\u20132013 in key sectors, (ii) improving \nlogical frameworks for Annual Development Program projects, (iii) improving IMED\u2019s technical \naudit capacity, (iv) redesigning IMED\u2019s MIS to align it with RBME results and performance \nindicators, and (v) improving capacity of IMED and relevant government staff. 5 \n \n10.  Through the TA, the government is now seeking ADB\u2019s further support to operationalize \nthe  IMED  strategic  plan  2008-2013,  improve  its  RBME  capacity  for  technical  projects, \nstrengthen the RBME system, and standardize logical frameworks in project formulation for \nbetter project readiness and project quality. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  impact  will  be  that  RBME  is  mainstreamed  in  development  planning  in \nBangladesh. The outcome will be that IMED\u2019s capacity for results-based monitoring of projects \nand programs is improved. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The five outputs below will make IMED\u2019s M&E process more focused on results by \nimproving its capacity for results-based monitoring of project and programs. \n \n(i)  Output 1: Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division\u2019s strategic \nplan, 2008\u20132013 implemented. IMED\u2019s strategic plan for RBME was developed \nunder  previous  ADB  TA  (footnote  4).  In  the  process,  IMED  sought  ADB\u2019s \nassistance in piloting the implementation of the strategic plan in the education \nand  transport  sectors.  Output  1  will  thus  develop  a  high-quality  RBME \nmechanism and strategy for selected projects in these sectors to help implement \nthe strategic plan. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 1999.

As effective M&E \nstarts from effective project design, the TA will work on improving the logical \nframework in project design. It will boost the capacity of IMED and relevant \nministry  officials  for  developing  a  results-focused  logical  framework  through \ntraining and workshops, and develop a comprehensive and high-quality logical \nframework and operational manual for projects in the education and transport \nsectors (i.e., those selected for implementation of IMED\u2019s strategic plan). \n(iii)  Output 3: Training programs on technical audits implemented. To improve \nthe capacity of IMED officials for monitoring and evaluating the technical aspects \nof development projects, they will be trained on how to conduct technical audits \nfor infrastructure sector projects. \n(iv)  Output 4: Information system improved. IMED is currently upgrading its MIS \nto collect data online from line ministries and agencies, and to analyze it for M&E. \nTo help measure project progress toward achievement of national goals, the TA \nwill review and revise the project performance indicators in the IMED MIS to align \nthem with those in the upcoming Seventh Five Year Plan. \n(v)  Output 5: Results-based monitoring and evaluation integrated in the draft \nSeventh  Five  Year  Plan,  FY2016\u2013FY2020.  The  results  framework  of  the \nupcoming Seventh Five Year Plan will be reviewed and inputs will be provided to \nensure that it is more RBME-focused. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). As the TA will not procure any \nequipment, there is no procurement-related tax. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nand  housing  accommodation,  office  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  meeting  venues,  and \nrelated facilities at IMED premises, including local transport for counterpart staff, telephone \nconnections for the TA team, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  IMED will be the executing agency. It will make available all relevant reports, documents, \nand information. ADB shall administer all consulting contracts. All disbursements under the TA \nwill be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All consulting \nservices  under  the  TA  will  involve  output-based  (lump  sum)  contracts  to  reduce  the \nadministrative burden and improve economy, efficiency, and value for money. \n \n16.  A project steering committee\u2014headed by the secretary of IMED, and represented by \nADB staff, the project director, and the international team leader\u2014will track implementation \nprogress. The resident mission will monitor TA implementation and designate a focal person for \nthe purpose. Half-yearly TA review missions will be conducted. IMED will submit quarterly TA \nprogress reports. IMED and the resident mission will jointly monitor the consultants\u2019 work, and \nall consultants will submit periodic progress reports to ADB. \n ", " 4\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.
