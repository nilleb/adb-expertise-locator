INTRODUCTION \n1.  The International Public Sector Accounting Standards Board (IPSASB) is a standards-\nsetting body operating under the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).1 The main \nactivity of the IPSASB is to develop financial reporting standards for public sector entities, with \nthe  aim  of  moving  toward  full-fledged  accrual-based  accounting  for  both  developed  and \ndeveloping  countries.  The  IPSASB  plays  a  critical  role  in  enhancing  the  quality  and \ntransparency of public sector financial reporting; promoting the adoption of, or convergence with, \nthe International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS); and providing guidance for first-\ntime adoption of IPSAS in the public sector. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been providing regional technical assistance \n(TA) for IPSASB\u2019s work program since 1997 (in five phases).2 IFAC has requested ADB and its \nother development partners to continue financing its ongoing initiatives for IPSAS development. \nRecognizing that the development of a high-quality financial reporting standard is a long-term \nprocess, the development partners continue to support the IPSASB, along with IFAC, which \nremains the largest fund provider. \n \n3.  Following the successful completion of the first five phases, this regional policy and \nadvisory TA3 proposes to support the IPSASB work program for 2016\u20132018, with high priorities \nassigned to the development of high-quality public sector financial reporting standards and other \npublications for the public sector, and to raise awareness of IPSAS and the benefits of their \nadoption  (Appendix  1).  It  aims  to  facilitate,  in  the  long  run,  accounting  policy  reforms, \naccountability, and capacity strengthening in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs); and \nto improve the public sector accounting system. Improvements in public sector accounting \nstandards will be instrumental for DMCs to achieve good governance. This is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 20204 and its development agenda on good governance, anticorruption, and an \nenhanced government financial management system.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  At the completion of the fifth phase of the TA, the IPSASB identified the following key \ndevelopment issues during 2016\u20132018:    \n \n(i)  Developing  high-quality  public  sector  financial  reporting  standards  and \nother publications for the public sector. Credible and transparent financial \nreporting is in the public interest. It has the potential to improve decision-making \nin the public sector, help governments to be more accountable to their citizens, \nand  enhance  global  fiscal  stability  and  sustainability.  As  the  international \n                                                \n1  IFAC, a global organization for the accountancy profession, was established in 1973 and was formally approved by \nthe International Congress of Accountants in 1977. The IFAC board established the public sector committee in \n1986 to issue pronouncements on accounting, auditing, and reporting in the public sector. Effective 10 November \n2004, the IPSASB replaced the public sector committee. \n2  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "2 \nstandard setter for the public sector, the IPSASB\u2019s role is to provide governments \nand  other  public  sector  organizations  with  high-quality  financial  reporting \nstandards and other publications that will enhance public financial management. \nThis will include accrual-based IPSAS and recommended practice guidelines \n(RPGs). By developing accrual-based IPSAS and RPGs, the IPSASB will be \nassisting governments to reflect the full economic reality of transactions, and \nprovide a comprehensive picture of the financial performance and position of \npublic  entities. This  addresses  a fundamental  aspect  of  strengthening  public \nfinancial management and enhancing accountability and decision-making in the \npublic sector.  \n \n(ii)  Raising awareness of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards \nand the benefits of their adoption. To raise awareness of IPSAS and the \nbenefits of their adoption, the IPSASB continues to believe that a strong outreach \nprogram  is  important.  The  IPSASB  has  dedicated  significant  resources  to \noutreach activities to date, and intends to continue these efforts. The activities \nwill focus on persuading governments to prepare accrual-based financial reports \nusing IPSAS, and encouraging users of government financial reports to demand \nbetter  information from governments\u2014information  that  would  be  available  by \nreporting in accordance with IPSAS. The IPSASB also considers additional ways \nto  engage  with  stakeholders  to  establish  credible  feedback mechanisms.  As \nadoption  increases,  obtaining  feedback  from  adopters  of  IPSAS  to  address \nemerging  issues  is  becoming  more  important.  Examples  include  enhancing \nefforts using technology, such as webcasts and podcasts, and co-organizing \nannual meetings of public sector national standard setters. \n \n5.  A key challenge for public sector financial reporting is that many governments still use \ncash-based accounting, so they provide minimal disclosure compared with what stakeholders \nexpect from the private sector.5 Cash-based reporting has limitations, as it does not provide \naccurate  and  complete  information  on  all  financial  transactions,  assets  and  liabilities,  and \nrevenues and expenses. The IPSASB encourages public sector entities to adopt accrual- based \naccounting, which will improve financial management and increase transparency, resulting in a \nmore comprehensive and accurate view of a government\u2019s financial position; and provide a \nbetter  basis  for  decision-making  at  different  levels  of  government.6 It  also  highlights  the \nimportance of capacity building in the public sector as a prerequisite for effective implementation \nof an accrual-based accounting system.  \n \n6.  Extensive activities have been achieved in the prior five phases. As of 31 December \n2015, 34 accrual-based IPSAS and one cash-based IPSAS were available for the use of public \nsector entities, including ADB\u2019s DMCs. During phase five, six IPSAS and three RPGs were \napproved. IPSASB also fulfilled one of its key strategic objectives in completing its public sector \nconceptual framework, carried out its first public consultation on its strategy and work plan, and \nestablished oversight infrastructure. A major lesson learned from prior phases is that capacity \nbuilding in the DMC public accounting profession continues to be a challenge in moving toward \nfull  accrual-based  accounting. This requires robust  system  support  that  can  accommodate \nimplementation, and is a long-term process with limited immediate benefits to DMCs. The \n                                                \n5  Cash-based accounting is a method of accounting where transactions are recorded when cash receipts and cash \npayments occur.  Thus, revenue is recorded when cash is received from customers, and expenses are recorded \nwhen cash is paid to suppliers and employees.   \n6  Under accrual-based accounting, transactions and economic events are recorded when they occur, regardless of \nwhen cash receipts and cash payments happen. \n ", "  3 \nIPSASB also needs to engage constantly with stakeholders to promote the benefits of sound \npublic financial management through the adoption of IPSAS. \n \n7.  IPSAS provide the foundation for achieving the long-term objectives of moving to full \naccrual-based accounting in the future for both developed and developing countries, and for \nimproving the quality and reliability of accounting and financial reporting for the public sector. \nInterest in IPSAS is increasing and a strong trend is moving toward their adoption; this trend is \nanticipated to continue. Over 80 countries and several international organizations have either \nadopted or have processes in place to adopt IPSAS.  \n \n8.   With the progress made in the first five phases, the IPSASB is seeking support through \nfurther TA for 2016\u20132018.   \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  this  TA  will  be  strengthened  public  sector  financial  reporting  and \nmanagement through increased adoption of accrual-based IPSAS.   \n \n10.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  decision-making  and  accountability  of  public  sector \nentities and enhanced global fiscal stability and sustainability.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: (i) high-quality financial \nreporting standards and other publications for the public sector, and (ii) programs to raise \nawareness of IPSAS and their public finance management benefits in order to influence their \nadoption. \n \n12.   The key activities of the sixth phase of the TA are (i) the development of new IPSAS and \nrevisions  to  existing  IPSAS;  (ii)  a  biennial  improvement  project  that  includes  amendments \narising  from  the  completion  of  the  conceptual  framework,  general  improvements  to  the \nInternational  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  and  changes  relating  to  statistical \naccounting;  (iii)  annual  publication  of  the  IPSASB  handbook,  which  contains  all  IPSASB \npronouncements on IPSAS; and (iv) capacity-building programs such as conducting outreach \nactivities (holding presentations, speeches, seminars, conferences, and others), establishing \nfeedback  mechanisms,  and  continuous  liaison  with  the  IFAC,  the  International  Accounting \nStandards Board (IASB), and national standard setters.  \n \n13.  As the IPSASB is competent in the subject area, no major technical project risks are \nexpected. However, the IPSASB needs to balance financial reporting needs for the public sector \nwith constraints faced by IPSASB and stakeholders, considering limitations on resources that \nare engaged in existing commitments and assessing potential projects. As oversight changes \nare implemented, demands on staff will be higher. Because of this, the IPSASB may not be able \nto allocate sufficient resources to projects that may be important to the DMC governments. Such \na  risk  is  mitigated  through  the  prioritization  of  critical  projects  and  by  conducting  a \ncomprehensive review of the IPSASB\u2019s broad strategic direction, including public consultation \non its work program. \n    \n ", "4 \n14.  ADB is one of the donors that will finance the IPSASB budget to carry out the work plan \nof the sixth phase. IFAC remains the largest financier of the IPSASB, funding about 75% of the \ntotal estimated costs. Collaboration carries the risk that the IPSASB work plan may become \nunsustainable if any donor fails to commit its funding.7 Such risk is mitigated by obtaining \nassurance from IFAC stating that the other donors, along with ADB, are committed to their \nfunding for the period and that any shortfall will be covered by IFAC\u2019s own resources. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $7,083,000, of which $330,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \n16.  Other organizations providing parallel cofinancing on a grant basis totaling $1,455,000 \nare (i) the Government of Canada $480,000; (ii) Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada \n$480,000;  (iii)  the  Government  of  New Zealand  $225,000;  (iv)  the  New  Zealand  External \nReporting  Board  $140,000  (in  kind);  and  (v)  the  United  States  Governmental  Accounting \nStandards Board $130,000 (in kind). IFAC will provide the remaining funding requirement of \n$5,298,000. ADB will not administer the funds from these external sources. Appendix 2 contains \nthe cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements    \n17.  IFAC will be the executing agency for the TA. As ADB will contribute only 4.7% of the \nIPSASB  2016\u20132018  work  program  budget,  it  is  efficient  to  use  IFAC\u2019s  organizational  and \nadministrative  procedures.  For  the  previous  five  phases  of  the  TA,  the  procurement \narrangements were such that all services to be financed out of ADB funds were procured in \naccordance with IFAC standard procedures.8  No goods or consulting services are anticipated to \nbe  procured  under  this  TA.  ADB  funds  will  be  used  to  finance  expenditures  related  to \ninternational travel  of IPSASB  members;  and meetings, conferences, seminars,  workshops \nconducted  by  IFAC,  and  other  administrative  support  costs.  IFAC  will  ensure  that  these \nexpenditures are incurred in the territories of ADB member countries and for services and \nfacilities supplied from such territories with due consideration of economy and efficiency. These \narrangements have worked well in the last five phases of the TA, and the same arrangements \nwill be implemented in this sixth phase. IFAC will implement this TA through the IPSASB, which \nwill  ensure  that  the  expected  outputs  are  disseminated  to  the  public  sector  through  the \npublication of new and revised IPSAS and outreach activities to engage with stakeholders.   \n \n18.  TA implementation will begin in December 2016 and is expected to be completed in \nDecember 2018. ADB funds will be released in three installments, each amounting to $110,000, \nand  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The first installment will be released upon \nreceipt  by  ADB  of  the  TA  letter  agreement  countersigned  by  IFAC.  The  two  subsequent \ninstallments will be released based on the submission of (i) a financial statement of accounts, \nshowing the use of grant funds from various funding agencies; (ii) audited financial statements \nof IFAC, with supplementary information on the IPSASB projects; and (iii) an annual progress \nreport on the project activities supported by the TA. IFAC will maintain separate records of ADB \n                                                \n7  ADB does not administer other donors\u2019 funds that are not channeled through ADB. As such, this is a collaboration \nand is not considered a cofinancing arrangement. \n8  Those services did not include consulting services. \n ", "  5 \nfinancing, and provide the following to ADB within 6 months of the fiscal year in which the funds \nare utilized: an annual progress report and audited financial statements.  \n \n19.  ADB will maintain an observer status in IPSASB meetings and is a member of the \nIPSASB  Consultative  Advisory  Group.  The  ADB  Controller\u2019s  Department  will  monitor  and \noversee the TA activities, and provide, as needed, direct input to the work of the IPSASB by \nreviewing  the  consultation  papers  and  exposure  drafts,  and  ensuring  that  ADB  member \ncountries\u2019 comments are addressed before the final standards and guidelines are issued.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $330,000 on a grant basis for \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards (Sixth Phase), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n    \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with: \nStrengthened public sector financial reporting and management globally through increasing adoption of accrual-\nbased IPSAS \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nImproved decision- a.
