Since  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) resumed  operations  in  Myanmar  in  2012, \nstrengthening and developing the capacities of sector institutions has been a priority before \nlending operations for urban development and water resume. ADB\u2019s approach is to assist line \nministries and other government entities with capacity development with the assumption that \nlater  project  implementation  will  benefit  from  these  activities.1 This  capacity  development \ntechnical assistance (TA) was developed taking into account the newly emerging challenges \nand requirements of a rapidly transforming Myanmar. The proposal was discussed with the \ngovernment during various consultation missions, and the government concurs with the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The opening of the economy in Myanmar will transform the country\u2019s cities and the way \nthey are managed. Till the recent government reforms, the government took the lead in urban \ndevelopment through the creation of large settlement areas with minimal infrastructure and \nservices. In newly created \u2018sites and services\u2019 settlements, people were offered serviced plots \nwhere homes could be built. Other urban planning was characterized by supply-driven schemes \nrepresenting the government\u2019s priorities rather than economic, social or environmental needs. \nCost recovery considerations in municipal finance did not feature prominently. The existing level \nof provision of essential environmental infrastructure and basic urban services, in particular for \nthose living in informal settlements, is far below standards commonly found in Southeast Asia, \nand this results in significant risks to public health and increased infant and child morbidity and \nmortality. The six selected cities3 face emerging challenges to improve urban service provision \nand organize a sustainable development path. Hence, the training approach suggested for this \nTA is an action approach to develop business plans for key urban service sectors, i.e., water \nsupply, sanitation, waste management, drainage, and flood management.   \n \n3.  Myanmar  has  experienced  major  reforms  since  2010,  including  democratization, \ndecentralization, and trade liberalization, and the country is expected to gradually integrate into \nregional and international trade networks and become increasingly involved in the international \ncommunity. Therefore, it is timely to introduce modern urban management concepts that reflect \nagreed  priority  needs  and  the  government\u2019s  socioeconomic  and  spatial  strategies,  and  to \nincorporate these concepts into the provision of essential services. Urban management will be \nexpected  to  respond  constructively  and  proactively  to  Myanmar\u2019s  changing  circumstances: \ngreater demands will be placed on the efficient functioning of cities, their planned and balanced \ngrowth, and their ability to provide more equitable access to services. Myanmar therefore needs \nto manage and regulate urban growth through proactive planning of infrastructure and services \nand transparent land use and development control.  \n \n4.  Governance. Myanmar shows weaknesses on governance according to most global \ngovernance indicators. The country\u2019s public financial management system, which is central to \n                                                \n1  The technical assistance (TA) deals with city-level capacity requirements. Other TA activities included under the \nproposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant for the Pro-Poor Community Infrastructure Development \nand Basic Services Project will be limited to four township administrations in Mandalay and Yangon only. The \nproposed capacity development TA for Myanmar Long-term Capacity Building for Civil Servants and Institutional \nDevelopment will deal with more general civil servants reform issues only.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 June 2013.  \n3  The six selected cities are Lashio, Mandalay, Mawlamyine, Monywa, Pathein, and Yangon. \n ", "2              \n \neffective service delivery, is a case in point. Across government ministries and agencies, budget \nplanning, transparency, execution, reporting, and accounting all have weaknesses. Evidence-\nbacked information on the Millennium Development Goals indicates that many dimensions of \nwell-being  improved  between  2005  and  2010.  Nonetheless,  Myanmar  remains  one  of  the \npoorest countries in the world with a per capita gross domestic product of $860, a Human \nDevelopment Index rank of 149 out of 187 countries, and 26% of its population living in poverty \nin 2010.4 Poverty incidence in rural areas is significantly higher than in urban areas, with 84% of \nthe poor living in rural areas. Regional disparities in poverty incidence are large, and disparities \nin non-income forms of poverty exist across regions and population groups. A large segment of \nthe  population  experiences  transitory  bouts  of  impoverishment  and  is  highly  vulnerable  to \nadverse weather and other shocks. Although local governments used to be considered the sole \nproviders  of  urban  infrastructure  services,  under  the  new  market-driven  economy,  these \nservices will increasingly need to respond to customer requirements and operate in a more \nprofit-driven manner. ADB\u2019s medium-term goal in  Myanmar is to assist the government in \npromoting  sustainable  and  inclusive  economic development  and  job  creation  in  support of \npoverty reduction. In the interim strategy period 2012\u20122014, ADB will emphasize three program \nareas: (i) building human and institutional capacity in ADB\u2019s areas of focus; (ii) promoting an \nenabling economic environment; and (iii) creating access and connectivity for rural livelihoods \nand  infrastructure  development.  ADB  will  mainstream  the  themes  of  (i)  environmental \nsustainability, (ii) good governance, (iii) private sector development, (iv) regional cooperation \nand integration, and (v) gender equality. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n5.  The TA will promote sustainable urban development in Myanmar cities by building the \ninstitutional capacity of local authorities, leading to the prioritized needs-based provision of \nessential  infrastructure.  This  capacity  development  activity  of  Part  I  (urban  management) \nprioritizes the development and effective management of six major cities (Batch I: Yangon, \nMandalay, and Mawlamyine; Batch II: Pathein, Lashio, and Monywa), and further encourages \nthe growth of district cities to stimulate balanced decentralized economic growth. Part II (flood \nmanagement) will focus on three key cities only (Yangon, Mandalay, and Mawlamyine).5 The TA \nwill develop the capacity of civil servants of local, regional, and government to plan, budget, and \nprepare for multisector urban development projects, some of which may eventually be funded \nby multilateral development banks, other development partners, or both. At the end of the TA, \nall six participating cities will have formulated business operations plans for key service sectors, \ni.e., water supply, sanitation, waste management, drainage, and flood management (Yangon, \nMandalay  and  Mawlamyine  only,  since  they  face  increased  threat  from  flooding).6 These \nservices represent relevant areas for possible future ADB investments. The business operations \nplans will cover aspects of technical operations, financial management, and inclusiveness of \nservice provision, taking into account the needs and payment capacity of the urban poor. The \nTA will test its activities in Yangon before scaling them up to other towns.    \n \n6.  The long-term outcome of the TA is an enhanced urban environment (and climate change \nresilience) of cities through urban and environmental infrastructure improvement and stronger \nurban management capacity. Planned urban growth, with improved urban infrastructure and \n                                                \n4   Ministry  of  National  Planning  and  Economic  Development,  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation \nAgency, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, United Nations Development Programme. 2011.

This capacity development \nactivity prioritizes the development and effective management of selected cities and encourages \nthe growth of district cities to stimulate balanced decentralized economic growth. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact of the TA is that urban management will become more effective \nand inclusive, reflecting new government policies on socioeconomic and spatially balanced \ndevelopment. The outcome of this TA will be improved skills of city authorities to manage urban \ndevelopment in a participatory and inclusive manner by formulating business operations plans \nfor urban service sectors (i.e., water supply, sanitation, waste management, drainage, and flood \nmanagement) through a \u201clearning by doing\u201d approach. Participating cities will also prepare \nguidelines for standards of urban services delivery covering water supply, sanitation, waste \nmanagement, drainage, and flood management. In addition, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) \nand the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology will conduct a hydro-meteorological analysis \nin the Ayeyarwady River basin and the Yangon plain and produce guidelines and manuals for \nproper flood risk management.7 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will focus on capacity building for urban management approaches, including \nstrategic urban planning and land management, development control procedures, preparation of \nurban  services  projects,  and  pro-poor  infrastructure,  which  may  be  implemented  through \ncommunity-based mechanisms. Priority subsectors for intervention are water, sanitation, solid \nwaste management, and flood control. Investment in Myanmar\u2019s urban development is strongly \njustified since urban areas have greatly contributed to economic growth and poverty reduction. \nCities are growing rapidly, yet their growth has been uneven and is often unplanned, and they \nremain  vulnerable  to  water-related  disasters,  such  as  floods  and  storm  surges.  Economic \nspecialization is taking place in medium-sized urban areas, which are growing in importance. \nThe urbanization trend is further strengthened by the market orientation of the economy and the \nregional policy of open borders, offering opportunities for Myanmar to benefit from its strategic \ngeographic location and its inclusion in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the \nGreater Mekong Subregion.8 The concept of modernization and the transformation of urban \nmanagement delineate new roles and responsibilities in urban development and management \nfor the  central government, for  state  or regional  governments,  and for  local governments. \nRegulated  urban  planning  and  land  use  administration  will  promote  transparency  and \ndemocracy among urban local governments.  \n \n9.  The tools and procedures required to introduce these concepts of urban management, \nwhich  form  part  of  the  public  administration  reform  program,  will  provide  opportunities  for \ninnovative approaches to urban management and will help the MOC develop standards and \nguidelines. \n \n10.  A hydro-meteorological analysis related to floods and storm surges in the Ayeyarwady \nRiver basin and the Yangon plain will be conducted. This analysis will be incorporated into the \nurban services business operations plans in the participating cities. The capacity of specialists \nin related government organizations, such as the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology, \n                                                \n7   Also known as the Irrawaddy River.  \n8   The linkages between the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Myanmar will require special attention and justify \nengagement in Lashio, to the northeast of Mandalay, and Monywa, to its northwest. \n ", "4              \n \nwill  be  developed  by  introducing  training  programs  and  incorporating  advanced  hydro-\nmeteorological analysis methods. \n \n11.  Expected outputs. There will be five major outputs: (i) community and capacity needs \nassessment  and  development  of training modules;  (ii)  implementation of  training  activities, \ntesting of course materials, and implementation of core program; (iii) formulation of urban \nservices business operations plans; (iv) institutional sustainability of capacity development; and \n(v) flood management.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,220,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  and  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \ncommunication facilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. The cost and financing \nplan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The MOC, through the Department of Human Settlements and Housing Development, will \nbe the executing agency.9 The MOC is the main agency responsible for the planning and \nmanagement of urban infrastructure and services. The Department of Human Settlements and \nHousing Development, which used to serve only the greater Yangon region, has become an \nentity of the MOC, and is now supposed to service the entire country. This expansion has \nplaced major strains on the limited capacities of the department and the MOC. The proposed TA \nis  intended  to  improve  the  MOC\u2019s  management  capacity  and  to  help  city  development \ncommittees to employ a \u201clearning by doing\u201d approach given their own capacity limitations. The \nexecuting agency will establish a multiagency steering committee consisting of representatives \nfrom the MOC, other ministries, professional organizations, and city development committees. \nThe steering committee will supervise the work and outcome of the TA.  \n \n14.  The  MOC,  through  the  Urban  Research  and  Development  Institute,  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The institute was established in January 2012 (with support from UN-\nHABITAT) to strengthen policy formulation and arrange training programs to build national and \nlocal  government  capacities  in  inclusive  urban  planning  and  management.  The  institute  is \ncurrently providing training for newly recruited staff of the Yangon City Development Committee \nthrough  its  induction  program  of  in-service  training.  Part  II  will  be  developed  with  the \nDepartment of Meteorology and Hydrology, which provides weather forecasts, flood forecasts, \nand flood reduction measures. The department will also be involved in the subsector of drainage \nand flood management under Part I. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2015. \nTA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with  the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).10 The TA will finance an estimated 61.5 \nperson-months  of  international  consultants  and  70 person-months  of  national  consultants, \ncovering both Part I and Part II. There will be one contract for Part I and two contracts for Part II.  \nAll consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Procurement under this TA will be in \n                                                \n9  The MOC intends to assume a lead role in the development of regulatory guidelines for the urban water sector and \nfor other urban services. Currently, there are many institutions involved in the oversight of rural water, while urban \nwater still lacks a clear leader.  \n10  Expenditures adhere to JFPR 2013 Policy Guidelines, specifically eligible expenditures and ineligible expenditures. \n       ", "5 \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The \nprocurement modality for Part I (urban management) will use quality- and cost-based selection, \nand  the  quality-cost  ratio  will  be  80:20.  Two  firms  will  be  recruited  under  Part  II  (flood \nmanagement),  one  by  single  source  selection,  and  the  other  by  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection with a quality-cost ratio of 80:20. The International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk \nManagement (ICHARM) will be hired by ADB through the single source selection method to \nprovide their own methodology of hydro-meteorological analysis in the Ayeyarwady River basin \nand the Yangon plain as well as other countries\u2019 lessons in better flood risk management. 11 \n \n16.  The  selection  of  ICHARM  is  justified  by  the  exceptional  value  of  its  technological \nexpertise and experience. ICHARM has developed  a proprietary and unique  rainfall runoff \ninundation  model,  which  can  reproduce  runoff  processes  in mountainous  areas  and rivers \ncoupled with flood inundation phenomenon in flood plains. ICHARM\u2019s model was employed with \nsatellite-based hydrological data in a Japan International Cooperation Agency project, \u201cProject \non a Comprehensive Flood Management Plan for the Chao Phraya River Basin,\u201d and was highly \nregarded for its valuable results in the analysis of the 2011 flood in Thailand. As a result of its \napplication  to  the  Indus  River  basin  in  Pakistan  utilizing  satellite-based  hydrological  data, \nICHARM\u2019s  model  was  lauded  by  the  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \nOrganization for its usefulness in flood-inundation forecasting and management over the large-\nscale river basin. There is a dearth of hydrological data, such as rainfall and elevation data, for \nthe Ayeyarwady River basin (the target area of this project), which comprises a mountainous \narea and a vast delta. To estimate flood risk for the basin, a comprehensive approach covering \nriver runoff processes from slopes to flood plains using satellite-based hydrological data must \nbe  applied.  ICHARM  also  provides  master\u2019s  and  doctoral  degrees  and  other  educational \nprograms  for  international  students,  including  those  from  Myanmar.  ICHARM  is  the  only \norganization in the region that can effectively execute flood inundation analysis as well as \ncapacity development in flood inundation analysis.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n17.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Myanmar to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Transformation of Urban \nManagement. \n \n                                                \n11 ICHARM is a research center under the management of the Public Works Research Institute, Japan.
