During an Asian Development Bank (ADB) consultation mission to the Fiji Islands in \nJune 2006, the Government of the Fiji Islands confirmed its request for technical assistance \n(TA)  to  support  reform  processes  in  three  key  infrastructure  sectors:  power,  water  and \nsanitation,  and  telecommunications.  The  TA  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and \nprogram update (CSPU) 2005\u20132006 for the Fiji Islands.1 The TA will support reforms to improve \ninfrastructure service delivery through the establishment of a multisector regulatory commission \nand the development of a rural electrification strategy.  \n \n2.  Following a Cabinet decision on 4 July 2006 to proceed with scoping for a multisector \nregulator, a TA fact-finding mission was fielded to the Fiji Islands from 4 to 8 September 2006 \nand reached an understanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s outcomes, outputs, financing \nplan, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference.2The design and monitoring \n \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Fiji Islands\u2019 economic performance has been mixed. Following an exceptionally high \ngrowth in gross domestic product (GDP) of 9% in 1999, the economy experienced a sharp \neconomic contraction as a result of the political turmoil in 2000. Annual growth for the period \n2000\u20132005 averaged about 1.8%, well below average global growth rates. The Government \nrecognizes that the development of key infrastructure is essential to diversify the production \nbase, reduce the country\u2019s vulnerability to adverse global market events, create employment \nopportunities, and promote sustained economic growth and poverty reduction. To promote \ndevelopment and sustainable economic growth, the Government has embarked on a reform \nprocess  and  has  identified  private  sector  participation  as  the  key  factor  for  improving  the \nperformance and delivery of infrastructure services.  \n \n4.  In the power sector, the Government has reformed the Fiji Electricity Authority (FEA), \nimproving the cost efficiency of its operations. However, the Government recognizes that major \nchallenges remain to reduce the cost of electricity, meet growing demand, and improve access \nto electricity services. A recently approved fuel surcharge has greatly improved FEA\u2019s ability to \nrecover costs and reduce its risk exposure, but has left consumers exposed to foreign exchange \nrisks and global fuel price hikes. The development of indigenous and renewable resources for \npower generation is urgent to sustain affordable services and promote economic growth. The \nGovernment recognizes that the private sector has a vital role to play in the power sector. It \nundertook a regulatory review in 2005 that made a number of recommendations to improve \ngovernance, increase investor confidence, and improve performance in the sector. \n \n5.  Over 30% of the population in the Fiji Islands does not have access to the electricity grid. \nOf these, about 40% have access to intermittent and unreliable electricity supply from stand-\nalone  diesel  generators  administered  by  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE).  About  300 \nhouseholds have solar home systems, which provide lighting for 4\u20136 hours per day. To extend \nthe electricity grid to rural areas which do not meet FEA\u2019s commercial criteria and to provide for \noff-grid electrification in remote areas, the Government, under the Rural Electrification Policy \n(1993), subsidizes investment costs. While there has been progress in rural electrification, the \nDOE\u2019s ability to provide affordable and reliable electricity services has been hampered by \n                                                 \n1\n ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006: The Republic of the Fiji Islands. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities as \u201cPreparing a Power Sector Road Map\u201d on 5 July 2006. \n ", "2     \nfinancial, institutional, and staff constraints; the lack of sustainable delivery mechanisms; and \nthe high cost of fuel and transport. Project preparation, management and monitoring remain \nweak and the lack of competitive bidding in grid electrification has led to poor cost control.   \n \n6.  The water and sanitation sector remains critically important for public health and the \nquality of life. However, it is characterized by deteriorating infrastructure, low cost recovery \n(requiring large subsidies by the Government), lack of technical capacity, and low operational \nefficiency. With ADB support, the Government has embarked on a major upgrade of water \nsupply and sewerage facilities in the heavily populated Suva\u2013Nausori corridor and a reform \nprocess to corporatize the water and sewerage department, improve cost recovery, and amend \nlegislation.3\n \n7.  The telecommunications sector has steadily grown over the last decade and demand is \nexpected to continue to grow. However, coverage is limited and costs remain high, despite a \nsharp  reduction  in  international  prices.  Rural  services  are  particularly  costly  and  are  too \nexpensive for most people living in rural areas. The government recognizes the critical role that \ntelecommunication  plays,  and  has  identified  the  absence  of  competition  as  a  significant \nconstraint. With support from the World Bank, the Government prepared a sector road map \nwhich was approved by the Cabinet in December 2005.  New legislation outlining arrangements \nto liberalize entry, broaden services, and promote technological progress is being considered by \nthe Government.  \n \n8.  The  Government  recognizes  the  significance  of  the  financial  and  human  resource \nconstraints in the economy. To promote cost-efficient regulation and to capture synergies and \neconomies of scale through the ongoing reforms in the three sectors, on 4 July 2006 the \nCabinet approved a proposal to proceed, in principle, with a multisector regulator.  With support \nfrom  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  the  Government  is \nbeginning a study to evaluate appropriate options for the structure, roles, functions and legal \nauthority  of  the  proposed  multisector  regulatory  commission.  Consideration  by  Cabinet  is \nexpected during 2006.     \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The objective of the TA is to promote good governance and a conducive environment for \ninvestments and competition in three infrastructure sectors: power, water and sanitation, and \ntelecommunications. The TA will provide assistance to the Government\u2019s reforms to improve the \nefficiency  and  capacity  of  infrastructure  services  and  increase  access  to  services  by  all \nconsumers.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will require continuous stakeholder consultations throughout the implementation \nprocess. Implementation will be phased to allow for such consultations and for the political \nprocess and legislative amendments. Two steering committees consisting of stakeholders from \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2003.

ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Fiji Islands for Capacity Building in \nWater and Sewerage Services. Manila (TA 4270-FIJ). \n ", "  3\ninvolved ministries will be established to guide the work under the TA. These committees will be \nkept informed of the implementation process. Consultations will also be held with a wider set of \nstakeholders and development partners. Throughout the implementation process, workshops \nand presentations will be held to ensure that stakeholders understand the rationale behind \nproposed approaches and options. To increase awareness and exposure to international best \npractice  approaches,  resource  persons  from  regulatory  authorities  and  rural  electrification \nprograms in the Asia and Pacific region will be invited to give presentations.  \n \n11.  The TA has two components. Component A covers the establishment of a multisector \nregulatory  commission  covering  the  three  infrastructure  sectors.  Component  B  covers  the \ndevelopment of a strategy for grid and off-grid rural electrification.  \n \n12.  The  Cabinet  decision  on  the  roles,  functions  and  legal  authority  of  the  multisector \nregulatory commission will guide the work to be undertaken under component A, which will be \nundertaken  in  two  phases.  Phase  1  will  comprise  proposals  for  amendments  to  existing \nlegislation and the preparation of guidelines for enabling legislation to establish the regulatory \ncommission\u2019s  legal  status  and  its  roles  and  functions  for  consideration  by  Cabinet  and \nParliament. The output of phase 2 will be a regulatory road map. The key activities will include: \n(i) the establishment of market structures, licensing, and contract arrangements to implement \nthe regulatory regime; (ii) capacity building, including workshops on international best practice \nfor infrastructure regulation and tariff methodologies; (iii) assessment of institutional structure, \nresource, and personnel requirements for the regulatory commission; (iv) annual operating \nbudget; and (v) an implementation plan.  \n \n13.  Component B will also be implemented in two phases. The first will include (i) an \nanalysis of the progress and gaps in rural electrification in the Fiji Islands, and (ii) a capacity- \nbuilding workshop to increase awareness of international best practice arrangements for rural \nelectrification. The second phase will include an assessment of options for institutional, financial, \nand  implementation  arrangements  for  rural  electrification.  Stakeholder  consultations  will  be \nundertaken to reach consensus on a realistic master plan for rural electrification.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,000,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $700,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the TA, equivalent to $300,000, by providing office accommodation and facilities and \ncounterpart staff. The details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MOFNP) will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA and has assigned the Ministry of Public Enterprises and Public Sector Reform \n(MPEPSR) and Department of Energy as the implementing agencies for components A and B, \nrespectively. MPEPSR will chair a steering committee for component A. The steering committee, \nwhich will be set up before the beginning of the AusAID-supported study, comprises senior \nrepresentatives of MOFNP, DOE, the Commerce Commission, the Ministry of Information and \nTelecommunications, FEA, and the Water and Sewage Department. The steering committee will \nprovide guidance to the consultants. MPEPSR will oversee implementation, allocate competent \ncounterpart staff, including an in-house lawyer, and provide office space for the component A \nwork.    \n ", "4     \n \n16.  DOE will chair the steering committee to guide the work for component B. DOE will be \nresponsible for establishing the steering committee, which will consist of senior representatives \nof MOFNP, FEA, and MPEPSR, before work begins. DOE will oversee implementation and \nprovide counterpart staff and office space for work on component B.  \n \n17.  A firm will be engaged to provide 15.5 person-months of international and 1 person-\nmonth of national consulting services. The firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The firm will be recruited using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures. Simplified technical proposals will be requested. Outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented with intermittent consultancy services over a period of 18 \nmonths from March 2007 to September 2008. It will be closely coordinated with ADB\u2019s ongoing \nwork  in  the  water  and  sanitation  sector  and  the  work  in  the  telecommunications  sector \nsupported by the World Bank. In addition to drafting Cabinet and Parliament proposals and \nlegislation amendments, the consultants will have ongoing communication with and receive \nguidance from the steering committees and ADB on the progress of work.  \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare a series of working papers under component A, including \n(i) a  review  of  existing  laws  and  regulations;  (ii)  the  scoping,  structure,  and  resource  and \nfinancing requirements; and (iii) the tariff methodologies. The draft final report, containing the \nregulatory road map, will be finalized in a publishable format after incorporating discussions \nfrom a stakeholder workshop. For component B, an interim report covering the scope of work \nduring  the  analytical  phase  will  be  prepared.  The  draft  final  report  containing  the  rural \nelectrification strategy will be finalized in a publishable format after a final workshop. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.

Phase 1: Diagnostic \n \n6.  The specific tasks will be as follows. \n \n(i)  in the context of the Government\u2019s strategic development planning, ascertain \ngovernment objectives for rural electrification and identify progress and gaps in \nrural electrification development; \n(ii)  review the Rural Electrification Policy (1993) and related legislation, as well as \ncurrent financing and implementation approaches and project designs for both \non-grid  and  off-grid  electrification  projects,  assess  gaps  in  the  delivery  of \nelectrification  services  in  rural  areas  under  current  programs,  institutional \narrangements and policy; \n(iii)  provide benchmark indicators for rural electrification to show progress over time, \nincluding  service  coverage  and  consumption  patterns,  and  provide  an \ninternational benchmarking comparison in the context of gross domestic product; \n(iv)  review the Fiji Electricity Authority\u2019s plans for grid extensions; assess the existing \npolicy  and  criteria  for  grid  extension,  least  cost,  and  approaches  to  finance \ncapital investments and operations and maintenance costs; prepare a detailed \nbudget outlining capital, operations and maintenance costs that illustrate funding, \nsubsidy and revenue arrangements across different stakeholders; \n(v)  provide an assessment of the existing policy and criteria for off-grid projects; \nidentify  current  expansion  plans  with  associated  budgets  and  funding \narrangements in line with (iv) above; assess the current planning capacity and \nimplementation and financing and reporting arrangements and identify resource \nand  institutional  constraints  (to  include  both  ongoing  funding  agency  and \nGovernment-supported  rural  electrification  projects);  assess  the  potential  for \nusing renewable energy service companies; ascertain the sustainability of off-grid \nprojects;  \n(vi)  prepare a rural demand forecast for electricity that is consistent with government \nobjectives for extending services to rural areas, including assessment of such \nparameters as rural household electricity use and likely patterns of appliance \nsaturation in newly electrified areas; \n(vii)  assess the affordability of poor households to overcome up-front costs, including \ndeposits, connection fees and wiring, and ability to pay for cost recovery tariffs; \nassess  subsidy  requirements;  determine  whether  existing  arrangements  for \naddressing connections for the rural poor are sufficient; \n(viii)  prepare a working paper on lessons learned that will address progress on rural \nelectrification,  institutional  aspects,  implementation  arrangements,  and  the \nexisting situation of rural electrification projects; and \n(ix)  conduct a workshop for stakeholders to discuss the working paper prepared \nunder (viii) above, institutional and implementation arrangements; present and \nreceive  feedback  from  stakeholders  for  the  work  program  for  the  rural \nelectrification scenarios under phase 2, and arrange for resource persons to \ndisseminate experience of best-practice rural electrification programs in the Asia \nand Pacific region. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n2.  Phase 2: Master Plan \n \n7.  Based  on  the  analysis  carried  out  under  phase  1  and  in  close  consultation  with \nstakeholders,  phase  2  will  identify  options  for  institutional,  financing  and  implementation \narrangements for rural electrification with associated scenarios for feasible master plans to \nelectrify the rural areas.   The specific tasks will be as follows: \n(i)  review best practices in international rural electrification, with case studies, that \nmay  be  appropriate  for  replication  in  the  Fiji  Islands,  propose  appropriate \napproaches, and outline the legal, institutional and financing arrangements and \nbusiness and management procedures; \n(ii)  prepare an assessment of the potential for a rural electrification fund under a \nsemi-autonomous board of directors; recommend the composition of the Board of \nDirectors and define its roles and functions; assess the required institutional and \nimplementation arrangements and resources, financing, subsidy and fund-flow \nrequirements;  review  existing  legislation  to  identify  legal  requirements  and \namendments to allow for the establishment of a rural electrification fund; provide \na time-bound implementation plan, clearly identifying the steps to be taken by \nvarious stakeholders;     \n(iii)  prepare  feasible  scenarios  to  electrify  rural  areas  in  the  Fiji  Islands  to  be \ndeveloped under (a) existing implementation and institutional arrangements and \n(b)  using  at  least  two  different  feasible  rural  electrification  approaches  (as \noutlined in (i) and (ii)); prepare detailed financing requirements outlining annual \ncapital  resources,  maintenance  and  operations  and  subsidy  requirements; \nparticular  emphasis  to  be  placed  on  the  sustainability  of  rural  electrification \nprojects;  \n(iv)  based on the consultative process and outcomes of the work above, prepare a \ndraft rural electrification strategy document; and \n(v)  conduct workshops for all stakeholders to discuss the proposed institutional and \nimplementation arrangements and the rural electrification strategy; revise the \nstrategy as appropriate for consideration by the Government and the Cabinet. \nC.  Reporting \n8.  In addition to drafting Cabinet and Parliament proposals and amendments to legislation, \nthe consultants will have ongoing communication with the steering committees and ADB on the \nprogress  of  work.  They  will  prepare  the  following  reports  and  working  papers for  the  two \ncomponents. \n \n  1.  Component A \n \n(i)  Phase 1. A working paper will review existing laws and regulations, identify gaps, \nand suggest the amendments that will be required for the establishment of a \nregulatory commission. The working paper will be submitted to the Government \nand ADB within 6 weeks of the beginning of services. \n(ii)  Phase 2. A working paper will describe the proposal on scoping, structure and \nresource  and  financing  requirements.  Another  working  paper  will  cover  tariff \nmethodologies. Both will be submitted within 2 months of the beginning of phase \n2.    Final  versions  of  the  working  papers  will  incorporate  feedback  from \nstakeholder  workshops  and  consultations.  The  consultants  will  also  prepare \nworkshop reports, as requested. A draft final report comprising phase 2 work \n ", "  Appendix 3  13\n(e.g., a draft regulatory road map), will be submitted within 5 months of the \nbeginning of phase 2. The final report will be submitted after a final stakeholder \nworkshop and within 4 weeks of the receipt of comments from the Government, \nfunding agencies, and ADB. The consultants will clearly indicate how comments \nhave been addressed and incorporated into the final report.  \n \n  2.  Component B \n \n(i)  Reporting for component B will comprise an interim report covering the outputs \nspecified under the analytical phase. The report should specify the options to be \nconsidered under phase 2. The interim report will be submitted within 8 weeks of \nthe  beginning  of  component  B.  The  draft  final  report  will  be  the  draft  rural \nelectrification strategy and will be submitted within 3 months of the beginning of \nphase 2. The final report will be submitted in a publishable format within 3 weeks \nof the final workshop. Workshop reports will be submitted within 1 week of each \nworkshop. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061031084401+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061025110621+08'00'", "Title": "Improving Infrastructure Services", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20061023033723"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2006) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  Fiji dollar(s) (F$) \nF$1.00 =  $0.5787 \n$1.00 =  F$1.7280 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  AusAID  \u2013  Australian Agency for International Development \n  CSPU  \u2013  country strategy and program update \n  DOE  \u2013  Department of Energy \n  FEA  \u2013  Fiji Electricity Authority \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  MOFNP  \u2013  Ministry of Finance and National Planning \n  MPEPSR  \u2013  Ministry of Public Enterprise and Public Sector Reform \n  REP  \u2013  Rural Electrification Policy \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSectors  \u2013  Multisector: energy; transport and communications; water supply, \nsanitation, and waste management \nSubsectors  \u2013  Energy sector development, telecommunications and \ncommunications, water supply and sanitation \nThemes  \u2013  Sustainable economic growth, private sector development \nSubthemes  \u2013  Fostering physical infrastructure development, \npolicy/institutional/legal/regulatory reforms \n \n \nNOTE \n(i)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVice President  C.
