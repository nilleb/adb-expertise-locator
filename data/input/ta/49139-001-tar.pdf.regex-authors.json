INTRODUCTION \n1.  The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) has been developed at the request of \nthe  Ministry  of  Roads and Transportation (MRT)  of  Mongolia. Through  this TA,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) will support the MRT in preparing a national road safety policy and \naction plan. In September 2015, ADB and the MRT reached an understanding on the objectives, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring  framework  is  in  Appendix  1.1 The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations \nbusiness plan for Mongolia, 2015.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Massive transport investments and policy interventions are needed to support efficient \nand  sustainable  development  of  all  sectors  in  Mongolia.  The  development  challenges  to \novercome in the transport sector include (i) reducing transport and logistics costs for trade, \nthereby  fostering  regional  integration;  (ii)  enhancing  transport  efficiency  and  safety; \n(iii) promoting urban efficiency through improved urban transport infrastructure and services; \n(iv) developing cost-effective solutions to enhance rural accessibility; and (v) improving sector \ninstitutional, financial management, and human capacity\u2014to ensure asset sustainability.    \n \n3.  As travel increases and transport infrastructure expands to meet the mobility needs of \neconomic  growth,  transport  system  efficiency  and  road  safety  become  challenging  issues, \nespecially  for  developing  countries.  Many  countries  experienced  a  large  increase  in  road \ncasualties at the early stage of economic growth and motorization, when massive infrastructure \ndevelopment dominated policy objectives. The World Health Organization reports that road \ntraffic crashes cost countries about 3% of their gross domestic product, rising to 5% in some \nlow- and middle-income countries.3 These external costs directly affect the economy and quality \nof life for road users and their families, and negatively affect the efficiency of the transport sector. \nThe introduction of a national road safety policy and action plan led by the central government \nwas the most common and effective measure adopted by most of advanced countries in terms \nof road safety such as Japan, Sweden, and United Kingdom for reducing road casualties.  \n \n4.  Introducing a national road safety policy and implementing an action plan require more \npolicy will, institutional coordination, and social awareness of road safety issues than physical \ninfrastructure investment. This will contribute to sustainable development and enhancement of \nquality of life. \n \n5.  Road safety in Mongolia. While economic growth has improved the quality of life and \nhelped reduce the poverty rate, a rapid increase in mobility and the rate of motorization4\u2014\nwithout an effective road safety management\u2014have led to growing road safety concerns in \nMongolia.5 According to the latest National Traffic Police of Mongolia data published in 2015, \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 October 2015. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2015. Manila. The TA was reconfirmed in COBP, 2016. \n3  WHO. 2016. Global Status Report on Road Safety, 2015. Manila. \n4  A total of 190,469 vehicles were registered in Mongolia in 2009, jumping to 480,000 in 2014. Some 70% of the \nvehicles are registered in Ulaanbaatar, where 45% of Mongolia\u2019s population is concentrated. \n5  Some 79.2% of vehicles are more than 10 years old; 52% of cars have steering wheels on the left and 48% have \nsteering wheels on the right. More than 50% of Mongolia\u2019s automobile  crash fatalities are pedestrians and \nmotorcyclists. In 2008, the government considered the nearly 1,500 deaths and more than 5,000 injuries from 2004 \nto 2008 as having reached disaster levels. \n ", "2   \n597 deaths were caused by traffic crashes in Mongolia in 2013\u2014above the world average.6 \nRapid motorization and road expansion in Mongolia, especially in Ulaanbaatar, are expected to \ncontinue to exacerbate road safety problems. The social and nonquantifiable costs of road \ntraffic deaths and injuries are expected to increase rapidly in Mongolia if the weak road safety \npolicy remains. Many countries have proven that systematic interventions in road safety, with a \nnational policy and action plan, can reduce road traffic deaths and injuries by more than 50%. \n \n6.  International  and  ADB  initiatives.  The  United  Nations  (UN)  General  Assembly \nrecognized road safety as an urgent global health issue and began the Decade of Action for \nRoad Safety in 2011.7 ADB and other multilateral development banks have recognized the \nextent of the road safety problem in developing countries, and the potential for supporting \ninterventions to alleviate this problem. They have (i) committed to establish a shared approach \nto managing road safety in support of the decade of action; (ii) established a working group on \nroad safety to share best practices, coordinate efforts, and establish partnerships in road safety \nwork; and (iii) started to explore ways of attracting additional financing for road safety. The UN \nhas  reaffirmed  the  importance  of  road  safety  by  including  it  in  one  of  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals.   \n \n7.  ADB established the Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan in 20108 to align \nits transport operations with Strategy 2020.9 The operational plan identifies road safety as one \nof the priority areas to be mainstreamed and scaled up in ADB\u2019s transport operations. To guide \nADB\u2019s work on mainstreaming road safety, ADB approved the Road Safety Action Plan in \n2012.10 More recently, the 14th Ministerial Conference on Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation endorsed a commitment to road safety in the subregion on 25 September 2015 in \nsupport of the UN decade of action\u2019s target to reduce the number of fatalities on roads by \n2020.11  \n \n8.  National initiatives and action needed. In 2012, the Government of Mongolia issued \nits National Strategy on Traffic Safety, including an implementation plan for 2012\u20132020 that \ntargets  a  50%  decrease  in  traffic-related  fatalities  and  serious  injuries.12 However,  the \nimplementation arrangements were not sufficiently detailed, and were not supported by enabling \ninstitutional frameworks, safety standards, or an enforcement and action plan for stakeholder \nagencies and institutions. If current road safety policy and management practices continue, \ntraffic casualties will increase with growing motorization rates and the expanding road network \nin Ulaanbaatar and throughout the country.13 The establishment of a comprehensive national \npolicy, supported by a detailed action plan to facilitate implementation, is urgently needed to \n                                                \n6  Road traffic crashes caused 21.0 deaths per 100,000 people in Mongolia in 2014, against the world average of \n17.4. \n7  UN. 2010.

Manila. \n11 The endorsed commitment includes (i) recognizing the road safety challenge in the region, (ii) tackling the \nchallenge together as a region, and (iii) committing to joint actions. The joint actions include data collection, \nresearch, capacity development, road standards, vehicle safety, enforcement, awareness and education, post-\ncollision care, partnership, and a regionally shared approach. \n12 The Government of Mongolia Resolution No. 146, The National Strategy on Traffic Safety, was signed by the \nPrime Minister of Mongolia and the minister of road, transportation, construction, city development on 2 May 2012.  \n13 The National Traffic Police reported that the newly improved arterial road (connecting Ginggiskahn Airport and \nUlaanbaatar City, total 13.7 kilometers) recorded 20 fatalities in 2014. The main reasons for such crashes are lack \nof enforcement of speed limits, traffic light violations by drivers, and illegal crossings by pedestrians. \n ", "  3 \naddress this emerging public health threat and to achieve the 50% decrease target in traffic-\nrelated fatalities and serious injuries.   \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be a reduction in road crash casualties in Mongolia. The \noutcome will be the development of a national road safety policy and action plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will adopt the principles and five pillars framework of the UN Decade of Action \nfor Road Safety in developing a national roads safety policy and supporting action plan. The \nprinciples include (i) a safety system approach, (ii) ownership at national and local levels, and \n(iii) an  inclusive  approach.  The  national  framework  includes  five  pillars:  (i)  road  safety \nmanagement, (ii) safer road design, (iii) safer vehicles, (iv) safe road users, and (v) post-crash \ncare.  \n \n11.  The TA will produce five outputs to establish an operational framework of traffic safety \nmanagement in Mongolia: \n(i)  Output 1: Mongolia road safety white paper prepared. A road safety white \npaper will be prepared to identify the road safety status in Mongolia, including \ncrash  records  and  patterns,  and  to  analyze  the  institutional  structure  of  the \ngovernment  agencies.  The  paper  will  serve  as  background  information  for \ndeveloping the national policy and action plan. \n(ii)  Output 2: National road safety policy and road safety action plan prepared. \nA  national  road  safety  policy  and  action  plan  will  be  prepared,  including \nimprovement targets, the legal and institutional framework on the five pillars. The \naction plan will be a set of time-bound actions to be taken by the ministries, the \ngovernment agencies, and the traffic police.  \n(iii)  Output 3: Road safety management capacity improved. The TA will develop \nand  conduct  a  road  safety  capacity  development  program  for  staff  in  the \ngovernment, the traffic police, transport operators, and road users. Stakeholders \nfor the five pillars will be identified and trained to implement the action plan \ngenerated by output 2. A training program and materials will also be developed \nfor transport-related officers and agencies. A crash investigation and analysis \ntraining course will be developed and implemented for 50 traffic police. \n(iv)  Output  4:  Information  and  communication  technology-based  crash \ndatabase and investigation application developed and deployed. An ICT-\nbased crash database and crash investigation application will be developed and \ndeployed to the traffic police.  \n(v)  Output 5: Knowledge products disseminated. Two knowledge products will be \ndisseminated: (a) the national road safety policy and action plan of Mongolia, and \n(b) a crash database and investigation system as a good practice example. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, suitably furnished office space with utilities \n ", "4   \nand telecommunication access, training venue, information materials, data, maps, and other \ndocuments as needed, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  executing  agency  is  the  MRT.  A  steering  committee  will  be  formed  with \nrepresentatives from major ministries including the MRT; the Ministry of Education, Culture and \nScience; the Ministry of Population Development and Social Protection; the Ministry of Health \nand Sports; Ulaanbaatar Municipal Government; the National Traffic Police; and the University \nof Law Enforcement. The Department of Strategic Policy and Planning under the MRT will be in \ncharge of the overall supervision of the TA to integrate the contributions from different ministries, \nagencies, and the traffic police through the national police academy. The implementation of the \nnational road safety policy and action plan recommended by the TA will be monitored through \nongoing transport sector loan projects in Mongolia14 as part of a capacity and quality assurance \ncomponent of the loans.     \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 14 months from 15 August 2016 to 14 October 2017 \nand will require a total of 16 person-months for four international consultants and 30 person-\nmonths for five national consultants. Specialists needed for the TA include (i) road safety policy \nspecialist, (ii) road traffic crash analysis  and remedial measures  specialist, (iii) road crash \ndatabase design and system specialist, (iv) database and ICT system specialist, and (v) road \nsafety education and awareness campaign specialist. ADB will engage individuals to provide \nconsulting services in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). All procurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) while disbursement will \nbe done in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime  to  time).  All  equipment  purchased  will  be  turned  over  to  the  executing  agency  on \ncompletion of TA activities. The consulting team will administer training and seminars. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Mongolia for Development of Road Safety Policy and Action Plan, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2012.
