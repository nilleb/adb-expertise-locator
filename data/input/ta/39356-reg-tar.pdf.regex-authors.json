The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  (1998)  outlines \nADB\u2019s commitment and approach to recognizing the circumstances of indigenous peoples and \nensuring that indigenous peoples participate in and benefit equally from development. The \npolicy recognizes that there are structural constraints that would limit its application, such as the \nlack of an appropriate legislative framework in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs), \nand the lack of necessary capacity of relevant development institutions and agencies. The \npolicy thus stipulates that strategies to overcome structural constraints should be explored. The \npolicy also stipulates that as necessary and appropriate, institutional strengthening and capacity \nbuilding support should be provided to relevant government entities when such support would \nincrease the effectiveness and efficiency of these entities. \n \n2.  ADB  is  in  the  process  of  updating  its  safeguard  policies,  including  the  policy  on \nindigenous peoples. The updated policies will be issued by the first quarter of 2009, along with \nsafeguard requirements for borrowers to ensure borrowers comply with the policy principles. \nThe updating process is timely, as it is being conducted following the adoption (in September \n2007)  by  the  United  Nations  (UN)  General  Assembly  of  the  Declaration  on  the  Rights  of \nIndigenous  Peoples  (DRIP).1 Most  of  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  voted  for  the  DRIP  adoption  and  are \ncommitted  to  enhancing  their  institutional  capacity  to  enable  them  to  comply  with  its \nrequirements. During the series of consultations regarding ADB\u2019s safeguard policy update, it \nwas stressed that ADB will need to provide capacity development for DMCs to enable them to \nfollow new ADB safeguard requirements and strengthen their country safeguard systems. \n \n3.  This regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) for Targeted Capacity \nBuilding for Mainstreaming Indigenous Peoples Concerns in Development will support selected \nexecuting agencies (EAs) in three DMCs develop their capacity to systematically mainstream \nindigenous peoples concerns in development projects. The TA will focus on Bangladesh, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and the Philippines. The concept for the TA was approved \non 29 July 2007. Fact-finding missions were undertaken from 24 June-2 July 2008 (PRC), 18-24 \nAugust 2008 (Bangladesh), and 10-25 September 2008 (Philippines). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The  uniform  application  of  the  ADB  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  poses  particular \nchallenges in Asia and the Pacific due to the huge variation in historical processes, cultures, \nideologies, economic resource base, demography, and political and institutional frameworks. \nMore than 75% of the world\u2019s 300 million indigenous peoples are found in the region in which \nADB operates. These people are typically vulnerable to the impacts of development projects, \ndespite often living in areas rich with natural resources. Very few ADB member countries have \nadopted  national  legislation  protecting  indigenous  peoples,  and  fewer  still  have  a  specific \ngovernment agency responsible for indigenous peoples welfare and development.  \n \n5.  In  the  special  evaluation  study  (SES)  conducted  by  ADB\u2019s  Operations  Evaluation \nDepartment (OED) on indigenous peoples safeguards,2 it was recommended that a sequential \napproach to capacity building on indigenous peoples safeguards be adopted, focusing first on a \nfew DMCs. The SES emphasized that such an approach is needed because of variations \n                                                 \n1  United Nations. 2008.  Resolution 61/295 (A/RES/61/295) of the 107th Plenary Session of the General Assembly:  \nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, 13 September 2007. New York: United Nations Department of \nPublic Information. \n2  ADB. 2007. Special Evaluation Study on Indigenous Peoples Safeguards. Manila.  \n ", "2   \namong both the systems of DMCs and their capacity to comply with the policy. The SES also \nrecommended that more Social Safeguards training be provided for EAs.  \n \n6.  Among ADB\u2019s DMCs, Bangladesh, the PRC, and the Philippines stand out due to their \nlaudable experiences in integrating indigenous peoples safeguards in ADB-supported projects. \nThese  countries  have  both  constitutional  provisions  and  separate  legislation  focusing  on \nrecognition  and  respect  for  the  rights  of  indigenous  peoples.  They  have  institutional \narrangements in place for dealing with indigenous peoples concerns, although they use different \napproaches.  All  three  countries  are  aware  of  the  importance  of  adhering  to  ADB\u2019s  policy \nrequirements but recognize that complying with both ADB\u2019s safeguard policy and their own \npolicies  will  require  that  they  meet  the  challenge  of  reconciling  different  procedures  and \npractices. The PRC and the Philippines voted in favor of the UN DRIP; Bangladesh abstained, \nbut indicated its general support for indigenous peoples rights.  Bangladesh and the Philippines \nhave dynamic indigenous peoples organizations active in trying to increase the sensitivity of \nADB-financed projects to the rights of indigenous peoples. Capacity development will focus on \nthese three countries, as each is prepared and committed to harmonizing their own safeguard \napproach with that of ADB. They have promising approaches to indigenous peoples safeguards \nthat could be replicated in other countries. Each country represents a geographical region and a \nkey sector where capacity development on indigenous peoples safeguards could be initiated.  \n \n7.  Bangladesh. Indigenous peoples communities in Bangladesh are generally divided into \ntwo  groups:  the  Chittagong  Hill  Tracts  (CHT)  group,  which  constitutes  the  majority  of  the \nrecognized tribal peoples; and the Plains group, which includes the Monipuri, Khasi, and Garo \n(Mandi) peoples, among others. Policies for the CHT group are more apparent and prominent \nthan policies governing the Plains group, and specific agencies have been assigned to cater to \nthe distinct needs of CHT peoples. The 1997 Peace Accord3 created two institutions mandated \nto oversee the development of the CHT: (i) the CHT Regional Council; and (ii) the Ministry of \nCHT Affairs (MoCHTA). The CHT Development Board, established in 1996, is mandated to \nundertake development works in the region. Further, three hill district councils were empowered \nby acts of Parliament to deliver a wide range of services to the three CHT districts (Rangamati, \nBandarban and Khagrachari). In contrast, the affairs of Plains peoples are addressed as part of \nregular mandates of ministries and local governments. Officially, the Special Affairs Division \nunder the Prime Minister\u2019s Office is responsible for the development of the Plains groups. The \npresence of various government agencies dealing with the welfare and situation of indigenous \npeoples in CHT and in the Plains poses special coordination challenges.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  is  most  often  triggered  in  Bangladesh  when \nimplementation of a project will include CHT and Plains areas where tribal peoples are known to \nreside. The Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project (CHTRDP) is one example where \nthe implementation of ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples has been widely commended. It was \nthe first major investment in the CHT after the signing of the 1997 Peace Accord and aimed to \nsubstantially raise people\u2019s standard of living\u2014particularly that of landless, small, marginal \nindigenous farmers\u2014and encourage women to become widely involved in community decision \nmaking and enterprise development. Various local agencies and local peoples expressed their \ndesire to use the CHTRDP as a model in preparing and implementing future projects taking \nplace in areas inhabited by indigenous peoples, given the project\u2019s success in enhancing the \npeace-building process in CHT, and its distinct participatory approach. \n                                                 \n3  MoCHTA. 1997. Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord signed between the National Committee on Chittagong Hill \nTracts Affairs and the Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti on 2 December 1997. \n ", "  3\n9.  People\u2019s Republic of China. Recognition of the various ethnic minorities (xiasu mensu) \nin the PRC is stipulated in the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law,4 which provides for clearly \ndefined  representation  mechanisms  and  socioeconomic  and  political  processes  in  ethnic \nminority areas. The government provides special assistance to support the development of \nautonomous  areas  and  provide  special  training  for  minority  cadres.  Substantial  funds  are \ncommitted for ethnic minority programs and autonomous regions. The State Ethnic Affairs \nCommission (SEAC) is mandated as the overall and highest policy-making body for the ethnic \nminorities\u2019  affairs.  SEAC  is  represented  in  the  provinces  by  Provincial  Ethnic  Affairs \nCommission, which coordinates with the autonomous governments\u2019 ethnic affairs bureaus. The \nCommission\u2019s membership is composed of representatives from line ministries; this structure is \nreplicated at the provincial and local government levels, simplifying coordination.  \n  \n10.  Many good examples of how to adopt the ADB Policy on Indigenous Peoples are evident \nin the country, but some challenges remain. While ADB requires extensive consultations on a \nproject-to-project basis, the PRC prefers and relies on its autonomous governments to work out \narrangements with their peoples (footnote 2). Coordination between EAs and implementing \nagencies (IAs) with ethnic affairs and cultural affairs commissions and/or bureaus often comes \nlate in the process, and there is a need to institutionalize coordination in project preparation and \nimplementation. Since safeguard plans include activities not under the direct responsibility of \nEAs and/or IAs, there is also a need to strengthen the monitoring system to track commitments \nmade  by  relevant  agencies  for  ethnic  minority  development  plans  (EMDPs).  Among  ADB-\nfinanced projects, the Dali-Lijiang Railway project in the Yunnan province is seen as a good \nmodel for future transport projects in the country. The project showcased good practices in \nterms of promoting the active participation of ethnic, cultural, social and other agencies and/or \nbureaus in implementing the EMDP, and strong sponsorship of project activities by autonomous \nlocal governments.  \n \n11.  Philippines. Among ADB\u2019s DMCs, the Philippines is the only country that has a national \nlegislation on indigenous peoples. The 1997 Indigenous Peoples Rights Act (IPRA)5 stresses \nthat indigenous peoples should equally benefit from development and that any development \nprogram or commercial undertaking within their ancestral domains be in accordance with their \nculture, customs and traditions. IPRA adopts self-determination as a key principle, and requires \nthat  free  and  prior  informed  consent  (FPIC)  be  obtained  from  indigenous  peoples  on \ndevelopment projects that affect them. IPRA created and mandated the National Commission \non Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) to be responsible in recognizing, protecting and promoting the \nrights of indigenous peoples.  While policies are in place, EAs and IAs of ADB-supported \nprojects have underscored procedural and institutional gaps that need to be addressed to \nstrengthen compliance with various provisions of the law. \n   \n12.  Various projects in the Philippines\u2014particularly those within ancestral domain areas or \nwith  ancestral  domain  claims\u2014considered  safeguards  to  ensure  beneficial  impacts  on \nindigenous peoples and avoid their displacement prior to the adoption of ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous  Peoples.  The  Cordillera  Highland  Agricultural  Resource  Management  project, \napproved in 1996, demonstrated the advantages of (i) seeking early support of the project by \nindigenous peoples, (ii) inclusion of specific actions for their participation in project decision-\nmaking,  implementation  and  monitoring,  and  (iii)  inclusion  of  components  and  activities  to \naddress potential cultural displacement and lifestyle adaptation. The project paved the way for \n                                                 \n4  PRC. 1984.

It initiated the \nformulation of guidelines for ancestral domain mapping, titling and sustainable development \nplanning in ancestral domain areas. It also piloted the initial guidelines for ascertaining FPIC. \nWhile  there  are  continuing  efforts  to  simplify  safeguard  guidelines  in  the  country,  further \nsimplification and harmonization (e.g., FPIC requirements and indigenous peoples planning as \nrequired by donors) are still being demanded by line agencies. There is also the need to further \nimprove inter-agency knowledge sharing of experiences in conducting safeguards and in further \nintegrating concerns relating to indigenous peoples in agencies\u2019 training modules. \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The overall impact of the TA is improved capacity of government and development \npartners to mainstream indigenous peoples concerns in development projects. The outcome is \nenhanced processes in selected EAs in three participating countries toward effective integration \nof indigenous peoples safeguards in projects and activities proposed for ADB assistance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  will  comprise  (i)  capacity  assessment  in  selected  EAs  in \nBangladesh,  the  PRC,  and  the  Philippines  for  designing,  implementing,  monitoring  and \nevaluating projects that are compliant to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples and national \npolicies  on  indigenous  peoples;  (ii)  a  capacity  development  program  toward  integrating \nindigenous peoples concerns and safeguard  requirements in project design, implementation \nand monitoring; and (iii) establishment of national or subnational level indigenous peoples \nnetwork forums. \n \n(i)  Component 1\u2014Capacity assessment. Activities under this component will include: (a) \nidentification of government agencies formulating indigenous peoples-related policies \nand implementing projects affecting indigenous peoples; (b) assessment of agencies\u2019 \ncapacities and training needs toward mainstreaming indigenous peoples concerns; and \n(c) identification and documentation of the experiences and lessons of selected EAs \nfrom projects affecting indigenous peoples.  \n(ii) Component  2\u2014Capacity  development.  This  will  include:  (a)  the  development  of \ntraining manuals and sector toolkits on indigenous peoples safeguards, to reflect ADB\u2019s \nindigenous peoples safeguard policy requirements; and (b) actual conduct of training \nand/or workshops on requirements related to indigenous peoples for selected EAs.  \n(iii) Component 3\u2014Development of indigenous peoples network forums. Activities will \ninclude: (a) identification of agencies and individuals in each country with extensive \ninvolvement  in  integrating  indigenous  peoples  concerns  in  project  design, \nimplementation and monitoring; (b) conducting a discussion forum on the results of the \nassessment and technical papers; (c) formation of the national or subnational indigenous \npeoples networks to serve as venues for discussing evolving indigenous peoples issues \nand concerns; and (d) formulation of a plan of action for institutionalizing the indigenous \npeoples network forum. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  technical  assistance  funding  program.  The  cost  estimates  are  in \n ", "  5\nAppendix  2.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.6 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the EA, and the proposed TA will be implemented from February 2009 to \nFebruary 2011 through the Environment and Social Safeguards Division (RSES) of the Regional \nand Sustainable Development Department. Focal point agencies for implementation in the three \ncountries will be MoCHTA in Bangladesh, SEAC in the PRC, and NCIP in the Philippines. An \ninter-agency steering committee, to be led by the focal agency, will be established in each \ncountry to provide the overall direction for project implementation following approved work \nplans. \n \n17.  Consultant inputs for the following activities are required:  conduct of capacity and \ntraining needs assessment of select EAs and implementing partners; preparation of technical \npapers on best practices in implementing ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples for selected \nsectors;  preparation  and  piloting  of  training  manuals  and  sector  toolkits;  coordination  of  a \ndiscussion forum using best practice papers as initial agenda and formation of indigenous \npeoples networks. Activities performed under the TA require 73 person-months of consulting \nservices,  including  7  person-months  of  international  and  66  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services. \n   \n18.  An indigenous peoples specialist will be recruited internationally to provide technical \nsupport for the TA. The international consultant will work in close coordination with national \nconsultants and maintain regular contact with MoCHTA, SEAC, and NCIP. The consultant will \nreport directly to RSES. International consultant support will be provided intermittently over the \nTA implementation period. Progress reports will be prepared by RSES on a 6-month basis. A \nnational consultant will be recruited as TA administration coordinator to assist in administering \nthe TA and will be based at ADB headquarters. \n \n19.  National  consultants  knowledgeable  in  organizational  assessment  and  diagnosis, \nmainstreaming of indigenous peoples\u2019 concerns, training modules development, and training \nand process facilitation will be hired to assist country focal agencies in undertaking the TA \nactivities. The national consultants will report to and work under the direct supervision of the \ndesignated  country  focal  agency,  which  will  provide  logistical  support  to  the  consultants, \nincluding  office  space,  furniture,  and  administrative  support.  The  consultants  will  prepare \nquarterly progress reports for submission to the focal agency and to RSES.  \n \n20.  Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All consultants will be \nrecruited on individual basis. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis for \nTargeted Capacity Building for Mainstreaming Indigenous Peoples Concerns in Development, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.
