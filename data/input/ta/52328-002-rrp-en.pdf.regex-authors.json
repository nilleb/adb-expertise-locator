THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia for the additional financing of the Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project. \n \n  The proposed additional financing will scale up improvement of rural connectivity with an \nadditional 1,100 climate-resilient, all-weather roads and 230 bridges totaling 2,900 kilometers \n(km) in 34 districts of the State of Maharashtra.1 It will also introduce climate-resilient rural \ninfrastructure design and implementation, as well as monitoring systems based on information \ntechnology for wider replication within the state and across India. \n \n  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has affected Maharashtra more than any \nother Indian state. The additional financing is aimed to accelerate the state\u2019s COVID-19 economic \nrecovery by generating rural employment and transforming agriculture. The roads and bridges will \nconnect rural settlements, productive agricultural lands and markets, and economic growth \ncenters across the state. This will enhance agricultural productivity and food security; strengthen \nagricultural value chains, building on the state\u2019s advanced agriculture marketing reforms; and help \nincrease the average growth rate of agriculture and allied activities to more than 5% per year by \n2030, which is a target of the state\u2019s strategic development plan, Vision 2030.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n  The ongoing Maharashtra Rural Connectivity Improvement Project is (i) improving and \nmaintaining the condition and safety of 2,100 km of rural roads; and (ii) enhancing the capacity of \nthe rural infrastructure agency and increasing awareness among road users.3 The ongoing project \nhas performed well since it became effective on 7 November 2019, and meets the following \ncriteria: \n(i)  Its project performance is rated on track. All 195 civil works contracts have been \nawarded for $170.8 million, with $59.6 million disbursed as of 1 July 2021. \n(ii)  All safeguard covenant items are being complied with. \n(iii)  Delivery of expected outputs is rated successful as initial actions are progressing \nas planned; as of 31 May 2021, overall physical progress of the road construction \nwas 80.9%, with 1,132.8 km (53.9%) completed. \n(iv)  Management of risks is rated successful, with all risks outlined in the ongoing \nproject\u2019s report and recommendation of the President managed successfully.4 \n \n  Additional financing is the optimum modality as it scales up the ongoing project by \nimproving the conditions and safety of an additional 1,100 rural roads and 230 bridges, totaling \n2,900 km. In response to the extraordinary August 2019 floods, which severely damaged more \nthan 5,000 km roads and 200 bridges, it will enhance resilience to extreme weather events.5 The \nproject will also create employment and provide economic stimulus for the rural population \naffected by the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown.

Maharashtra is India\u2019s leading \nstate in terms of its contribution to the national economy and accounted for 13.8% of India\u2019s \nnational gross domestic product prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.10 Economic development is \ncentered  around  the  major  cities,  and  in  the  latest  official  national  data  in  2011,  in  rural \nMaharashtra about 24% of the population still lived below the poverty line.11 Maharashtra has \nexperienced the greatest impact from COVID-19 among India\u2019s states, with 6.05 million cases \n(19.9% of India\u2019s total), while the death toll accounted for 30.7% of India\u2019s total as of 29 June \n2021. COVID-19 has badly impacted employment in rural and urban Maharashtra, and the \nunemployment rate rose to 20.9% in April 2020.12 COVID-19 hotspots are continuously emerging \nin rural villages in Maharashtra as the rural poor face issues with access to health care system \nand a shortage of doctors. Prior to COVID-19, as much as 40% of the population lived in poverty \nin some remote districts, and about 34% of the additional financing benefits will impact the poor \nand vulnerable.13 The additional financing will improve market access; facilitate access by the \nrural poor to health care systems; and increase rural employment, in particular for returning \nlaborers,  including  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  It  will  therefore  contribute  to  regenerating \nMaharashtra\u2019s economy.  \n \n  Farmers in Maharashtra were in distress even prior to COVID-19 as 79.5% of them had \nsmall  and  marginal  land  holdings  and  practiced  mostly  subsistence  farming.  Agriculture \ncontributes 15% of Maharashtra\u2019s state gross domestic product, and 68% of the rural labor force \nis  engaged  in  agriculture.14 An  agricultural  transformation  is  underway  in  Maharashtra  as \nconsumption patterns in urban areas move away from food grains to high-value agriculture \nproducts. Since 2000, the area under food grain cultivation has declined, and Maharashtra has \n \n6  The Ministry of Finance requested $500 million in ADB assistance in a letter dated 13 September 2018. \n7  ADB provided attached TA to the ongoing project to the improve road asset management system and enhance the \nsustainability of road assets.

However,  agricultural  growth  and \ntransformation are spread unevenly across the state. Maharashtra has urban centers with large \nconsumer  markets  such  as  Mumbai,  Pune,  and  Thane.  COVID-19  has  now  provided  an \nopportunity  for  direct  marketing  of  agriculture  produce  because  the  large  markets  were \ntemporarily closed and traders could not visit farms because of travel restrictions. Unfortunately, \nrural farmers cannot take full advantage of direct marketing because they lack reliable access. \nMost farmers have experienced post-harvest crop losses totaling almost 40%, caused mainly by \nlack of connectivity to markets and climate variability; the trend worsened around the lockdown \nperiod.15 The state government considers the additional financing as an essential measure to \nstimulate the rural economy, employment, and incomes. \n \n  Climate impacts. Maharashtra is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. A \nsubstantial increase in monsoon rainfall is projected in 2030s and beyond based on the climate \nrisk and vulnerability assessment.16 Poor households are extremely vulnerable to flood damages, \nand transport disruption is a major indirect flood impact.17 This was demonstrated by the extreme \nrainfall in Maharashtra and neighboring states on 1\u20138 August 2019 that exceeded normal average \nrainfall by over 400%. The additional financing will include repairs to the roads and bridges in the \nflood-affected areas, which have been identified through flood damage assessments. The repairs \nwill include additional measures such as community consultation to strengthen flood resilience. \nThe  project  will  provide  design  and  construction  manuals  for  climate-resilient  design  and \nconstruction, and it will enhance the climate resilience of roads and bridges by building new cross \ndrains and culverts, increasing the capacity of cross drains, building new retaining walls, and \nincreasing the road elevation to address the potential impacts from flooding. The contractors will \nbe responsible for the maintenance of the roads and bridges for 5 years after the completion of \nthe civil works to ensure sustainability of the roads under various weather conditions. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n  The additional financing is aligned with the following impact: quality, reliable, sustainable, \nsafe, and affordable roads that provide equitable access for all developed (footnote 2). The \nadditional financing will have the following outcome: road transport efficiency in 34 districts in \nMaharashtra increased.18 The overall aggregate impact and outcome of the project remains \nunchanged  from  the  ongoing  project.  An  outcome  indicator  has  changed  because  of  the \nexpansion under the additional financing. \n \n  The additional financing will scale up the ongoing project\u2019s outputs by (i) expanding \nimprovement and maintenance of rural roads under output 1 by 1,100 roads and 230 bridges for \na total length of 2,900 km; (ii) adding further piloting of new technologies, such as asphalt blended \nwith plastic waste and pre-cast concrete arch bridges under output 1; and (iii) adding the following \nunder output 2: (a)  an impact evaluation study and (b) a mobile mapping monitoring  and \nevaluation tool. The overall project outputs are as follows. \n \n \n15 L. Goedde et al. 2017. Harvesting Golden Opportunities in India Agriculture: From Food Security to Farmers\u2019 Income \nSecurity by 2025.

The overall project will improve the condition of \nabout  5,000  km  of  rural  roads,  including  230  bridges\u2014connecting  rural  communities  with \nproductive agricultural areas and socioeconomic centers\u2014to all-weather standards, with climate \nresilience and safety features.19 The roads were selected based on population, economic activity, \nand road connectivity. The designs of roads and bridges were developed and refined through \nintensive  stakeholder  consultation  and  incorporated  climate  resilience  measures  such  as \nimproved cross and side drainage, increased surface elevations, and stronger embankments in \nthe designs. Environment-friendly alternative sealing options, such as asphalt blended with plastic \nwaste, will be piloted on selected road segments. Other new technologies, such as fiber-\nreinforced concrete and pre-cast concrete arch bridge, will also be piloted for further practical \napplication in similar settings. Operation and maintenance of the roads and bridges will be \ncovered under contractual maintenance for 5 years following construction.20 \n \n  Output 2: Capacity of rural infrastructure agency and awareness among road users \nin the state enhanced. The overall project will deliver (i) manuals for design, construction, and \nmaintenance of climate-resilient and gender-inclusive rural roads; (ii) an information technology-\nbased implementation and monitoring system with a mobile mapping tool; (iii) training of the \nMaharashtra  Rural  Road  Development  Association  (MRRDA)  on  road  safety,  road  asset \nmanagement, contract management, and climate-resilient design and construction; (iv) impact \nevaluation of the project benefits through baseline and end-line surveys; and (v) training of road \nusers and local residents on (a) improving road users\u2019 awareness on road safety and gender-\nbased  violence  (including  sexual  exploitation,  human  trafficking,  and  sexually  transmitted \ninfections); and (b) enhancing women workers\u2019 road construction and maintenance skills. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n  ADB\u2019s  approach.  ADB  is  helping  to  demonstrate  exemplary  rural  and  agricultural \ntransformation  through  several  mutually  complementary  projects  in  Maharashtra;  once \ndemonstrated, this transformation will be replicated in other states. The holistic support for rural \ntransformation includes road improvements that provide essential economic and social access, \nirrigation efficiency improvements through rural electrification, and agribusiness enhancements. \nThe rural connectivity projects in combination with a state road improvement project support \nessential and reliable logistics infrastructure that connects agricultural production areas with \ndomestic  markets  and  export  hubs.21 The  ADB-financed  Maharashtra  Rural  High  Voltage \nDistribution System Expansion Program will enhance power supply for water pumps and other \nuses by farmers with small and marginal holdings in rural Maharashtra.22 The Sustainable Coastal \nProtection  and  Management  Investment  Program  has  provided  sustainable  shoreline \nmanagement and land use plans along the state\u2019s coastline, which is experiencing salinity \nintrusion and erosion.23 ADB is currently preparing an agriculture value chain project that will \nsupport farmer producer organizations and small agribusiness companies (with a special focus \non women) in transitioning to high-value agriculture and food processing; integrated subproject \n \n19 Roads were selected from a priority list in the district road development plans. Safety measures include cautionary \nand information signs, guard posts, and speed breakers. \n20 The same contractors that build the roads will perform routine maintenance for 5 years. The government will finance \nall maintenance costs from its counterpart funds.  \n21 ADB. India: Maharashtra State Road Improvement Project. \n22 ADB.

ADB closely collaborates with development \npartners such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the World Bank to explore \ndevelopment synergies. Financial assistance to rural road development in India is critical to \nenhancing  connectivity  and  improving  rural  communities\u2019  access  to  socioeconomic  growth \ncenters. An evaluation of ADB\u2019s assistance program in India for transport operations found that \nADB\u2019s support resulted in evident improvements in connectivity and mobility.25 \n \n  Replication strategy. ADB has provided support to the Government of India\u2019s Pradhan \nMantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY),  a  nationwide  program  that  seeks  to  improve  rural \nconnectivity across all states.26 Following PMGSY\u2019s successful implementation, several states, \nincluding Maharashtra, have launched state-level programs called Mukhya Mantri Gram Sadak \nYojana  (MMGSY).  Subsequently,  the  Government  of  India  requested  that  ADB  support \npreparation and implementation of Maharashtra\u2019s MMGSY with the objective of establishing a \nmodel that can be implemented in other states.27 Under the ongoing and additional financing \nprojects, ADB's value addition to Maharashtra\u2019s MMGSY comprises (i) designing rural roads to \nall-weather  standards  with  climate-resilient  and  safety  features,  (ii)  introducing  road  asset \nmanagement systems to enhance sustainability of rural road assets already improved through \nPMGSY and MMGSY, and (iii) introducing civil works contracts with post-completion maintenance \nfor 5 years.28 To further enhance ADB\u2019s value addition, the additional financing includes use of \nmobile mapping technology to regularly monitor the project roads and evaluate changes in \nroadside development. The mobile mapping images will be linked to a web-based real-time \nproject monitoring system being developed in the ongoing project. ADB will actively replicate and \ndisseminate the experience and knowledge gained from the value addition in and outside India \nthrough the Capacity Development Resource Center in ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission, project \nworkshops, and regional forums, including ADB\u2019s Rural Development and Food Security Forum. \n \n  Value for money in procurement. The ongoing project has completed 192 procurement \ntransactions using the single-stage, two-envelope process. An assessment of the transactions \nnote that all were completed\u2014from issuance of bid documents to contract award\u2014within 4 \nmonths. This rapid transaction time demonstrates that using repeat procurement processes and \nsimilar packaging provides value for money. The additional financing will continue the same \napproach and ensure there is sufficient competitive tension and community involvement in the \nworks shared across 414 small value works packages. Value for money is also enhanced by \nquickly awarding contracts to the lowest-evaluated substantially responsive bid and including 5-\nyear contractual maintenance in the works packages. \n \n \n24 ADB.

The project establishes a design manual for climate-resilient \nrural infrastructure for wider replication within and outside the state. For the additional financing, \nclimate adaptation is estimated to cost $78.6 million, and climate mitigation is estimated to cost \n$18.0 million. ADB will finance 100% of mitigation and adaptation costs. Details are in the climate \nchange assessment.30 The mitigation amount was derived as lower fuel consumption from the \nimproved road surface using ADB\u2019s Transport Emissions Evaluation Model for Projects. The \nadaptation costs are additional climate-proofing costs for installing new cross-drains, increasing \nthe sizes of culverts, constructing additional retaining walls and side drains, and increasing the \nroad surface elevation above flood levels. \n \n  Coronavirus disease response financing. The additional financing is an important part \nof Maharashtra\u2019s economic recovery package to stimulate rural employment and incomes. It will \naddress the labor market impacts of the crisis by providing income-generating opportunities to \nthe rural Maharashtra population. The additional financing is designed to be implemented quickly \nby  local  contractors  with  local  labor,  material,  and  equipment,  and  without  involuntary \nresettlement. With an average contract value of $0.9 million and contract period of 2 years, the \nproject is expected to generate 3.1 million person-days of local semiskilled and unskilled labor. \nThe project will also address employment among women, who have been disproportionately \nimpacted by COVID-19, by providing at least 25% of the job opportunities to women. COVID-19 \nresponse financing is estimated at $34.3 million. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The  State  of  Maharashtra,  acting  through  MRRDA,  will  continue  as  the  executing \nagency.31 Under the ongoing project, the MRRDA has established (i) a project management unit \n(PMU), with the MRRDA secretary-cum-chief executive officer appointed as the project director, \nand assisted by two deputy project directors; (ii) six regional superintending engineers; and (iii) \n34 project implementation units (PIUs) in the districts, each headed by an executive engineer and \nsupported by three deputy engineers. The PIUs are responsible for the day-to-day implementation \nand supervision of project activities. The PIUs fall under six regional offices, each headed by a \nsuperintending engineer.32 The regional offices are responsible for authorizing procurement and \npayments  on  contracts  and  for  monitoring  and  reporting  to  the  PMUs.  A  team  of  project \nimplementation support consultants, engaged under the ongoing project, will continue to support \nthe additional financing project. \n \n  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2021\u2013August 2026a \nEstimated completion date  31 August 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  28 February 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  The State of Maharashtra acting through the MRRDA \n \n30 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 The State Government of Maharashtra established the MRRDA as a special purpose vehicle to implement the \nPMGSY and the MMGSY. It was established on 8 May 2003 through a government resolution under the Society \nRegistration Act, 1860. \n32 The six regions in Maharashtra are Amaravati, Aurangabad, Konkan, Nagpur, Nashik, and Pune. \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \n(ii)  Implementation unit  1 project management unit, 34 project implementation units in the districts under the six \nregional offices (1,395 full-time staff) \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding   414 contracts (civil works)  $382.9 million \nConsulting services  Individual consultant selection  15 person-months  $200,000 \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing and advance contracting will be used for civil works contracts. \nadvance contracting  Retroactive financing will be provided to finance expenditures incurred before the loan \nbecomes effective, but not earlier than 12 months before the date of signing of the loan \nagreement and not exceeding 20% of the respective loan amount. The borrower and the \nexecuting and implementing agencies have been advised that approval of advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the additional \nfinancing project. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MRRDA = Maharashtra Rural Road Development Association. \na  Civil works contracts will include 5-year routine maintenance, which will extend beyond the project implementation \nperiod. The government will finance all maintenance costs. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n  Project readiness and the impact of the coronavirus disease. The MRRDA will \ncontinue to use the same master bid documents that were prepared for the ongoing project and \nwill initiate advance contracting actions by issuing the invitation to bid for civil works. The COVID-\n19 pandemic has not affected the implementation arrangements, and cost estimates have been \nupdated to reflect the latest indicators. The contractors for the ongoing project have mostly \nresumed  their  works  with  appropriate  safety  measures  based  on  government  orders  and \nguidelines. The detailed project readiness activities are in the PAM. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n  The MRRDA prepared the detailed designs for improving about 2,900 km of single-\ncarriage roads and 230 bridges, the condition of which varies. The designs complied with the \ngovernment\u2019s standards and specifications for improved design and construction of rural roads. \nThe MRRDA incorporated road safety measures (such as carrying out road safety audits and \nprecautionary  interventions  along  high-risk  road  segments)  and  climate-resilient  rural  road \nconstruction measures, with due consideration given to the observed impacts of the 2019 floods \nin the designs (e.g., through slope stabilization, drainage, and cross-drainage measures). The \nMRRDA also adopted a context-sensitive design approach to incorporate community concerns. \nConstruction will use (i) proven technology while piloting the use of some materials (e.g., polymer-\nmodified asphalt, asphalt blended with plastic waste, fiber-reinforced concrete, and precast \nconcrete arch bridges) to inform research and development; and (ii) materials compatible with \nlocal conditions. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n  ADB carried out the economic analysis in accordance with ADB guidelines.33 The principal \nbenefits considered in the analysis are transport cost savings in terms of vehicle operating costs, \ntravel time savings of existing and incremental traffic on these roads over the analysis period, and \nlower greenhouse gas emissions. Other unquantified benefits include improved road safety, \n \n33 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "9 \nhigher climate resilience, and improved quality of life for rural communities. The economic \nanalysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return \nof 17.0% for the additional financing project and 16.0% for the overall project. Road and bridge \npackages in all districts have an economic internal rate of return above the acceptable rate of \nreturn of 9%. Sensitivity analysis indicated that, with a 10% increase in capital costs or a 10% \ndecrease in benefits, the overall investment remains economically viable. The analysis assumes \nthat 50% of vehicle operating cost savings will accrue to vehicle owners and 50% will be passed \non to the road users by the operators in the case of public transport and freight vehicles.34 The \nadditional financing is non-revenue generating, and financial management and sustainability were \nassessed to ensure financial viability. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n  The  additional  financing  will  not  generate  revenue.  Instead,  the  MRRDA  will  be \nresponsible for maintaining the roads improved under the project for the first 10 years, after which \nthe roads and their maintenance will be turned over to local governments. The state government \nwill finance road maintenance in accordance with the PMGSY guidelines. However, past practice \nsuggests that it is unlikely that sufficient funds will be provided to fully cover maintenance costs. \nTo better safeguard its rural road asset base,  the state government adopted a rural road \nmaintenance policy in August 2019; the policy\u2019s objectives include removal of the existing rural \nroad network maintenance backlog. Further, routine maintenance for the first 5 years will be \nincluded in all road works contracts financed by the project. In addition, the following activities \nbeing implemented under the ongoing project to operationalize the maintenance policy and \nestablish sound rural road asset management systems will equally impact the sustainability of the \nroads  improved  under  the  additional  financing:  (i)  development  of  performance-based \nmaintenance manuals for the MRRDA; (ii) development of training programs for the MRRDA and \nthe local governments to improve their capacity to (a) maintain roads, (b) estimate the required \nresources accurately, and (c) prepare sufficient budget requests with improved prioritization of \nmaintenance over construction; and (iii) provision of capacity building to the MRRDA to improve \nits road asset management system under the technical assistance (TA) grant attached to the \nongoing project. As a part of the legal agreements, the state government assured ADB that \nadequate  maintenance  funds  would  be  provided  to  the  MRRDA  and  local  governments \nthroughout the estimated economic life of the roads improved under the additional financing. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n  Financial  management.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines.35 The financial management assessment found that  MRRDA \nhas adequate financial management capacity to (i) record the required financial transactions; (ii) \nprovide reliable annual financial statements and audit reports in a timely manner; (iii) safeguard \nthe  financial  assets;  and  (iv)  use  the  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  under  ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement procedures up to a threshold of $200,000 for each expenditure item. However, the \nassessment  also  identified  the  following  risks:  (i)  MRRDA\u2019s  limited  experience  in  ADB\u2019s \nprocedures and reporting requirements and there is scope for improving the financial reporting \npractices, and (ii) decentralized flow of funds to the PIUs. As a result, the overall financial \nmanagement risk is assessed moderate. The identified risks will be mitigated by: (i) providing \ncontinuous training in ADB\u2019s systems and procedures, (ii) including comprehensive financial \nreporting as part of the quarterly financial reports, (iii) ensuring internal audits are undertaken on \n \n34 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n35 ADB. 2015. Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note. Manila. \n ", "10 \na quarterly basis, and (iv) adopting project-specific financial management procedures. Moreover, \nMRRDA will maintain separate books of accounts for the additional financing project, and the \nproject financial statements will be audited annually by an auditor acceptable to ADB, following \nauditing standards acceptable to ADB. \n \n  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement of works will be in accordance with the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017 as amended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) in the same manner as the ongoing \nproject. The MRRDA procurement capacity assessment concluded that MRRDA has the capacity \nto  undertake  procurement  under  the  project. The  government  will  continue  to follow  open \ncompetitive  bidding  (national  advertisement)  procedures  and  will  use  the  standard  bidding \ndocument  that  was  used  for  the  ongoing  project.  Procurement  will  continue  to  use  the \ngovernment\u2019s electronic procurement system, which has been improved in agreement with ADB.36 \nThe procurement procedures are detailed in the procurement plan in the PAM. India\u2019s Prevention \nof Corruption Act (1988 and amended in 2018) combats corruption in government agencies and \npublic sector business. Maharashtra\u2019s Anti-Corruption Bureau is responsible for investigating \ncorruption allegations in the state. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the national government and the state government. The specific \npolicy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n  Poverty  reduction  and  social  impact.  During  project  preparation,  extensive \nconsultations were held with 42,000 people living in the project districts. The MRRDA carried out \ntransect walks with male and female community members along all the road and bridge locations. \nThe  community  members,  including  elected  village  representatives,  were  overwhelmingly \nsupportive of the project and expressed the need to improve mobility from their villages to \ncommercial and industrial centers, agricultural markets, social services, and other locations to \nincrease economic and social opportunities. Local communities expressed that provision of all-\nweather roads and bridges in rural areas would help reduce poverty. It is expected that the project \nwill generate about 3.1 million person-days of employment for local communities, of which at least \n25% will be for women, over the construction and maintenance periods. The project will improve \nfarmers\u2019  access  to  markets  and  service  centers,  which  will  contribute  towards  improved \nagricultural productivity and farmers\u2019 incomes. All-weather roads and construction of missing \nbridges will also promote investment in agribusiness and enhance agriculture value chain. \n \n  Gender  mainstreaming.  The  additional  financing  is  categorized  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. The additional financing will scale up the ongoing project\u2019s outputs and ensure \nthat the transport and rural connectivity improvements will benefit men and women equally. In \nAugust 2020, the MRRDA appointed the seven senior officials who were nominated as gender \nfocal points for the PMU and six regional offices. The MRRDA prepared a gender action plan that \nspecifies activities, targets, responsible agencies, and timeframes for implementing, monitoring, \nand reporting on gender actions.37 The gender action plan focuses on capacity development of \nwomen workers so that they can benefit from the semiskilled and unskilled labor opportunities \ngenerated in road construction and maintenance. The ongoing project will develop manuals for \nconstruction and maintenance of rural roads with climate-resilient and gender-inclusive designs \nthrough a participatory approach. It will also develop capacity to ensure the active involvement of \nwomen in the design, construction, and maintenance of rural roads. The manuals will be endorsed \n \n36 ADB approved e-procurement for national competitive bidding in all investment program states during 2009\u20132011. \n37 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "11 \nby the MRRDA and used for future MRRDA road projects. Women will gain increased awareness \non road safety and other issues, such as gender-based violence, sexual exploitation, human \ntrafficking, and sexually transmitted infection prevention. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.38 \n \n  Environment (category B). Environmental checklists and transect walks were used to \nidentify key environmental impacts and risks from improving the rural roads and bridges. Further, \nan  Integrated  Biodiversity  Assessment  Tool  and  government  reports  were  used  for  the \nassessments and to prepare the initial environmental examination.39 The results show that project \nsites are not located in any of the state\u2019s protected and key biodiversity areas. Potential impacts \nare site-specific, temporal, and reversible such as increased noise and exhaust levels from \nvehicles, waste generation, and occupational health and safety hazards. Consultations were \norganized with the relevant government agencies and local people to understand the level of \nproject acceptability, concerns, and overall opinions. Feedback has been integrated in the project \ndesign and mitigation measures of the environmental management plan. To ensure the effective \nimplementation of safeguards requirements, the MRRDA will be supported by environmental \nexperts at the regional level. A functioning grievance redress mechanism has been established \nunder the ongoing project, and it will be used for the additional financing. Environment safeguard \nmonitoring reports will be produced on an annual basis during the project period. \n \n  The state\u2019s indicative climate projections indicate rainfall and temperature will gradually \nincrease over 50 years. More frequent and intense flooding is anticipated within the project \nlocations. Through consultations with local communities, the MRRDA has identified vulnerable \nsections and adopted climate-resilient designs to address climate risks. Adaptation measures will \ninclude increased cross-drainage capacities, construction of new cross drains, elevated road \nsurfaces, strengthened road embankments, and construction of side drains. \n \n  Involuntary resettlement (category C). ADB screened all the project roads and bridges \nfor  impacts  on  involuntary  resettlement.  The  screening  found  no  physical  or  economic \ndisplacement resulting from involuntary land acquisition or involuntary restrictions on land use. \nMost of the improvement works will be carried out within existing road corridors and rights-of-way. \nIn the same manner as the ongoing project, voluntary land donation may be used when additional \nland  will  be  required.  The  community  participation  framework  establishes  guidelines  for \ncommunity consultation and voluntary donation. Details of the social safeguard screening along \nall roads are documented in the social safeguards due diligence report. \n \n  Indigenous peoples (category C). The screening confirms that indigenous peoples \n(scheduled  tribes)  are present  in  the state  as  individual  households  living  among  broader \ncommunities rather than as distinct communities. The additional financing will not directly or \nindirectly affect the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples \nbecause  the  project  works  will  not  impact  territories  or  natural  or  cultural  resources  that \nindigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset.
