I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Precautionary Financing Facility.1 The development policy \nletter  confirming  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  commitment  to  maintain  macroeconomic \nstability and implement measures to cope with the global economic slowdown and heightened \nuncertainties is in Appendix 3. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Government of Indonesia Request for Precautionary Financing Facility \n2.  ADB\u2019s Precautionary Financing Facility. Like many other economies, the Indonesian \neconomy has been affected by the deterioration in the global economic outlook and turbulence \nin the financial markets. Learning from lessons from the 1997\u20131998 Asian crisis and the 2008\u2013\n2009 global financial crisis, the government has introduced various measures to safeguard \nagainst any major trade and financial impacts emanating from the current global economic \nsituation. The proposed $500 million facility (a countercyclical support facility [CSF] with a \nprecautionary  financing  option)  will  bolster  the  government\u2019s  preparedness  to  cushion  the \nimpact of higher volatility in the financial market, given the government\u2019s increased dependence \non the market to finance its budget requirements. The government has met the access criteria \nfor a CSF: (i) continued good macroeconomic management; (ii) potentially significant economic \nimpact (resulting in this case from a possible worsening in the eurozone crisis and the global \neconomic slowdown); and (iii) implementation of a countercyclical program in the revised 2012 \nbudget (Appendix 4).2 \n \n3.  Contingent financing approach. The facility will be part of a $5.0 billion\u2013$5.5 billion \ncontingent financing package provided by ADB, the Government of Japan, the Government of \nAustralia, and the World Bank. The Government of Indonesia is committed to first meeting its \nfinancing needs from market sources and will back up its intention with confidence-boosting \npolicy measures. It will use the facility as an insurance device and fallback option to be utilized \nonly  if  market  stabilization  operation,  utilization  of  alternative  debt  financing  sources,  and \nutilization of accumulative surplus cash are unable to fulfill the financing need.3 The government \nbelieves that the announcement of this support package would send a strong positive signal to \nthe markets, making it more likely that Indonesia would meet its financing needs in 2012 and \n2013 from market sources. \n \nB.  Global Economic Turbulence and Indonesia Context \n4.  Impacts of the eurozone crisis. The eurozone crisis, which intensified after September \n2011, and the global economic slowdown continue to present risks to the Indonesian economy \nthrough two main channels: trade and finance. \n(i)  Trade channel. After expanding by 37% (year on year) in January\u2013August 2011, \nthe country\u2019s export growth declined in September\u2013December 2011 following the \neurozone  crisis.  Despite  Indonesia\u2019s  diversified  export  destination  and \ncommodity composition, export growth ended up much lower at 27.5% for 2011. \nOverall, net exports still contributed 1.5 percentage points to the country\u2019s 6.5% \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2   ADB. 2009. Enhancing ADB\u2019s Response to the Global Economic Crisis \u2500 Establishing the Countercyclical Support \nFacility. Manila. \n3  Utilization of the Precautionary Financing Facility (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", " 2  \neconomic growth in 2011. Preliminary data for 2012 point to a further decline in \nexport growth: year-on-year growth for the first quarter of 2012 decreased to \n5.1%, from 30.8% in the same period in 2011. This suggests that the dynamic \nsupport received from external demand in 2011 before the eurozone crisis will be \nabsent in 2012 and possibly the year after. \n(ii)  Financial channel. Indonesia has been more vulnerable to volatility in financial \nmarkets because of its relatively open capital account and the significant foreign \npresence in its stock and bond markets. At the same time, the domestic bond \nmarket is still very shallow at 13.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011 \n(34.8% in the Philippines and 67.5% in Thailand). As a result, government bond \nyields are relatively more volatile than in other countries in East Asia. In February \n2011, the yield of the 5-year rupiah bond rose to 8.5% due to negative market \nsentiment related to the eurozone crisis and expectations of accelerated inflation \ndriven by soaring food prices. During September\u2013November 2011, the Jakarta \nStock Exchange composite index experienced a massive correction of about \n15%. Nonresident investor holdings of rupiah-denominated tradable government \nsecurities fell from $29.3 billion in July to $23.4 billion at the end of November \n2011. Reflecting significant capital outflows from government securities and other \nportfolios, the balance of payments turned into a deficit in the second half of \n2011, and the country\u2019s gross international reserves dropped by $14.5 billion, \nfrom $124.6 billion in August 2011 to $110.1 billion in December 2011. \n \nTable 1: Budget Summary, 2009\u20132012 \n(Rp trillion) \nItem   2009  2010  2011  2012 \n State Revenue and Grants  848.8  995.3  1,199.5  1,358.2 \n 1.

Increased  dependence  on  market  financing.  Indonesia\u2019s  gross  financing  needs \nremain high (Table 1) despite its low budget deficit and continued decline in debt-to-GDP ratio. \nIn 2012, with a budget deficit target of 2.2% of GDP, the government will need to borrow \nRp326.8 trillion ($36.2 billion or 3.8% of GDP), reflecting increasing debt amortization. At the \nsame time, in line with the government strategy to develop and deepen the domestic capital \nmarket, the share of financing from market sources has increased significantly from 59.7% in \n2009 to 75.6% in 2012. With increasing reliance on market sources to meet its financing needs, \n ", "  3\n   \nmarket volatility larger than what took place at the outset of the eurozone crisis could disrupt the \nfinancing of the 2012 budget. \n \n6.   In its April 2012 Asian Development Outlook, ADB suggests that uncertainties from the \neurozone remain. While the risk of a European liquidity crisis has diminished, fiscal austerity \nacross the eurozone could slow economic growth. If the global economic situation worsens, the \nlikely impacts include weaker export demand, more volatility of capital flows, and less availability \nof  trade  finance.  Policy  responses  should  include  switching  to  social  and  infrastructure \nspending, expanding expenditures while boosting revenues, and combating rising inequality. \n \n7.  The potential impacts of the eurozone's economic turmoil on the Indonesian economy in \n2012 can be summarized in the following three scenarios.4 \n(i)  Mild baseline scenario. The sovereign debt crisis in Europe will be resolved \ngradually and the economic recession in some countries in the eurozone will \nremain  mild,  with  limited  second-round  impacts  on  Indonesia\u2019s  main  trading \npartners. As efforts are made to diversify export destinations, Indonesia\u2019s exports \nwill weaken only moderately. At the same time, the government will introduce \nmeasures to stimulate domestic demand through both fiscal and monetary policy \nto  compensate  for  weakening  export  performance.  Under  this  scenario, \neconomic growth will fall slightly short of the government\u2019s 6.5% target. \n(ii)  Slower growth scenario. The uncertainty over the ultimate resolution of the \nlingering sovereign debt crisis in Europe and related austerity measures remains \nand the economic recession in some countries in the eurozone will deepen, with \nmore pronounced second-round impacts on Indonesia\u2019s main trading partners. \nUnder this scenario, with a more significant decline in exports, economic growth \nin Indonesia could miss the government's target by about 1 percentage point. \nThe impact of this external development on the domestic financial market will be \nlimited  to  a  brief  volatility  and  temporary  correction  without  disrupting  the \ngovernment\u2019s access to market financing. \n(iii)  Crisis scenario. The economic recession in some countries in Europe will turn \ninto a wider and deeper crisis that affects more European core countries and \nother developed nations outside the eurozone. Similar to 2008, the crisis will not \nonly weaken international trade substantially, but will also severely affect the \nfinancial markets in developed and emerging economies. Under this scenario, \neconomic growth in Indonesia could miss the government's target by more than \n1.5  percentage  points.  More  importantly,  the  impact  of  the  global  crisis  on \ndomestic  financial  markets  would  also  be  significant,  affecting  domestic \nconfidence and disrupting the government\u2019s access to budget financing through \npossible capital outflows and increased borrowing spreads. Under this scenario, \nwithout the contingent financing package, spending on priority sectors such as \ninfrastructure  and  education  would  be  negatively  affected.  An  economic \nslowdown of more than 1.5% would have a serious impact on unemployment, \npotentially affecting 0.8 million people. In addition, the quality of employment \nwould be reduced as up to 4 million of the labor force could move to the informal \nsector, as experienced in the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. \n \n8.  Lessons  from  earlier  ADB  countercyclical  support  and  development  partner \ncoordination. The ADB Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s 5special evaluation study for the \n                                                 \n4  Summary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n5  ADB. 2011. Special Evaluation Study: Real-Time Evaluation of Asian Development Bank\u2019s Response to the Global \nEconomic Crisis of 2008-2009. Manila \n ", " 4  \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s past CSFs in five countries, including Indonesia, recommended the \nintroduction of a precautionary financing option as a facility variant. These recommendations \nhave now been reflected under the existing policy for policy-based lending.6 Therefore, the \ngovernment\u2019s request represents an opportunity for ADB to utilize this innovative modality to \nmeet the needs of a middle-income developing member country like Indonesia. The facility is an \noutcome of ADB policy dialogue with the government in coordination with development partners \non crisis monitoring, crisis management protocol, and other related reforms.7 \n \nC.  Macroeconomic Management \n9.  Swift response and proactive measures. The government\u2019s response to the risks of \nthe eurozone crisis was swift and involved various proactive measures aimed at maintaining \nconfidence in the domestic finance sector. To anticipate the potential risks associated with large \ncapital inflows into government rupiah securities, in mid-2011 the government introduced the \nbond stabilization framework. The framework includes actions to stabilize the domestic bond \nmarket in case of market turbulence, such as a buyback mechanism in the secondary market \nusing funds from the state budget; fund-pooling by state-owned enterprises; and utilizing the \naccumulated budget surplus. The government also updated its crisis management protocol, \nspecifying appropriate responses at different levels of crisis for Bank Indonesia, Ministry of \nFinance (Directorate General of Debt Management Office), and Badan Pengawas Pasar Modal \ndan Lembaga Keuangan (Capital Market Supervisory Agency). \n10.  Bank Indonesia also implemented macroprudential measures to reduce short-term and \nspeculative capital inflows and mitigate the risks of sudden reversals. These measures are \nintroducing  a  minimum  holding  period  for  Sertifikat  Bank  Indonesia  (Bank  Indonesia \ncertificates),  reinstating  limits  on  short-term  offshore  borrowing  of  commercial  banks  to  a \nmaximum of 30% of capital, and increasing banks\u2019 foreign currency reserve requirements. In \nMarch 2012, to reduce currency speculation, Bank Indonesia also issued a regulation requiring \nevidence  of  an  underlying  real-sector  transaction  for  foreign  currency  transactions  above \n$100,000. Bank Indonesia also tightened lending standards for motor vehicle financing by \nraising the down-payment requirement. After the inflation downward trend firmed in the second \nhalf of 2011, Bank Indonesia started an easing cycle in October 2011 by cutting its policy rate \nby 100 basis points (bps) through February 2012. The cuts were also taken to frontload some \nadjustment measures in response to the expected global economic slowdown. \n \n11.  Recent macroeconomic developments. The country\u2019s macroeconomic condition has \nremained sound despite the global economic slowdown. The mix of policy responses has \nproven effective so far. The financial market stabilized quickly from the turbulence resulting from \nthe eurozone crisis in September 2011. Despite declining nonresident holdings of local-currency \ngovernment securities in the August\u2013November 2011 period, the yields of 5-year rupiah bonds \nwere down by about 115 bps in 2011. After recovering further in January\u2500March 2012, the \nyields were under pressure in May due to declining nonresident investor holdings of rupiah \ndenominated tradable government bonds, reflecting heightened uncertainty in the eurozone and \nweaker global economic prospects. The rupiah also depreciated by about 3.5% in May. \n \n12.  GDP growth edged up to 6.5% year on year in 2011, from 6.2% in 2010, supported by \nsustained private consumption, stronger investment, and expanding net exports. GDP growth in \nthe first quarter of 2012 weakened to 6.3% due to lower export growth. Consumer confidence \nhas also declined since February over weakening income expectations. Year-on-year inflation \n                                                 \n6   ADB. 2011. Review of ADB\u2019s Policy-Based Lending. Manila. . \n7  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  5\n   \nrates fell from 7.0% in late 2010 to 3.8% at the end of 2011, as food price inflation decelerated \nsharply from 15.6% to 3.6%. The deceleration trend was reversed in March and the year-on-\nyear  inflation  rate  edged  up  to  4.5%  in  April.  This  is  attributed  to  increased  inflationary \nexpectation associated with the government\u2019s earlier plan to increase fuel prices. \n \n13.  The actual budget deficit for 2011 was 1.2% of GDP, again lower than the government\u2019s \ntarget of 2.1%. The lower-than-budgeted deficit resulted from a combination of better revenue \nperformance and lower capital expenditures, offsetting higher spending on energy subsidies. \nTax revenue collection was up by 0.7% of GDP, achieved through widening the tax net and \nimproving tax administration. As a result, the tax-to-GDP ratio edged up to 11.8% of GDP in \n2011, from 11.2% in 2010. On the expenditure side, under-disbursement in capital spending \ncontinued in 2011, although the outcome was slightly better than in 2010. However, higher-than-\nexpected oil prices boosted spending for fuel and electricity subsidies to 3.4% of GDP, from \n2.2% in 2010. With a lower deficit, the debt-to-GDP ratio of the government fell further to 25% in \n2011, maintaining its down trend. \n \n14.  The country\u2019s external position improved after the economic turbulence in September \nand October 2011. After recording a large surplus in the first half of 2011, the capital account \nturned into deficit in the second half of the year, reflecting increased portfolio capital outflows \ndriven by the prolonged uncertainties in the eurozone. Consequently, net portfolio investment \nplunged by 68.2% to $4.2 billion in 2011. However, foreign direct investment (FDI) rose strongly \nby 31.9% to a record level of $18.2 billion, in line with increased investor interest in Indonesia\u2019s \nburgeoning consumer demand. While the current account surplus fell further (to 0.2% of GDP), \nthe balance-of-payments surplus remained large at $11.9 billion due to strong FDI inflows. At \nthe end of 2011, the gross international reserves increased by $13.9 billion to $110.1 billion. \nDespite  weakening  export  performance  in  January-April  2012,  gross  international  reserves \nincreased to $116.4 billion (6.4 months of imports and government debt payments). \n \n15.  Reflecting  the  country\u2019s  strong  macroeconomic  performance  and  resilience,  rating \nagencies  upgraded  Indonesia  to  investment  grade.  Fitch  Ratings  upgraded  Indonesia\u2019s \nsovereign credit rating to BBB\u2013 on December 15, 2011; Moody\u2019s followed suit on January 18, \n2012 (Baa3). The upgrades are expected to boost the flow of long-term capital into the country. \n \n16.  Debt sustainability. Indonesia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen steadily since 2001, even \nagainst the backdrop of the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis. The government\u2019s countercyclical \nspending program is not expected to adversely affect debt sustainability as a large proportion of \nthe 2012 budget stimulus is devoted to additional infrastructure spending, which will improve the \ncapacity of the economy to keep growing in the medium term. Even with a 10% increase in \ngovernment debt liability in 2012, the debt ratio is projected to return to the current level by \n2016.8 \n \nD.  The Government\u2019s Countercyclical Support Measures \n \n17.  Infrastructure and social spending. In light of the continued uncertain outlook in the \ninternational economic environment (oil price volatility, a fragile recovery in the United States, \neurozone economic concerns, and slowing growth in emerging economies), the 2012 budget \nincludes provisions to give the government more flexibility in managing and mitigating risks \nemanating from a more volatile external environment. The 2012 budget allocates significant \nadditional resources to implement the Masterplan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's \n                                                 \n8  Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " 6  \nEconomic  Development  (MP3EI),  2011\u20132025.  The  MP3EI  includes  efforts  to  accelerate \ninfrastructure  development,  introduce  key  reforms  to  remove  bottlenecks,  and  close  the \ndevelopment  gap  between  the  eastern  and  western  regions  of  Indonesia  by  improving \nconnectivity and developing six economic corridors. To address the removal of infrastructure \nbottlenecks, the budget boosts capital increased by 45.6% in 2012 from that in 2011. The \nbudget also increases social spending, including for the country\u2019s flagship poverty reduction \nprograms such as Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (Community Empowerment \nProgram).  To anticipate the impacts of weaker global growth and increasing oil prices, in March \n2012 the Parliament passed a revision to the 2012 budget, widening the fiscal deficit to 2.2% of \nGDP from an originally planned 1.5%. The revised budget contains three key components: (i) a \nprovision to increase the administered domestic fuel price once the 6-month average of the \nIndonesian crude oil price exceeds $120.80; (ii) an additional $2.8 billion of social spending to \ncompensate Indonesians for inflation resulting from any fuel price rise, comprising direct cash \ntransfers and rural infrastructure investment; and (iii) conditional cash transfers. The revised \nbudget also allocates an additional $1.9 billion in capital spending. \n \n18.  Strengthening public finance management. The effectiveness of the government\u2019s \nfiscal stimulus depends on better budget execution. Execution of investment projects continues \nto be a challenge. The key agencies implementing infrastructure spending (the ministries of \nPublic Works and Transportation) have relatively low absorptive capacity rates, causing delays \nin disbursements and procurement that could undermine the government\u2019s stimulus package. \nTherefore, measures to accelerate disbursement of capital spending will form an important part \nof the government\u2019s efforts to stimulate domestic demand. Attempts by the government to \nremove obstacles to more efficient budget execution since 2010 have had mixed success, to a \nlarge extent because of the relatively old regulation governing budget execution. To be able to \nuse  fiscal  policy  to  stimulate  domestic  demand  in  case  of  a  crisis,  projects  need  to  be \nimplemented  in  a  swift  manner.  To  rectify  the  constraints  above,  the  government  recently \nestablished a task force to accelerate budget disbursements, led and coordinated by the Unit \nKerja Presiden Bidang Pengawasan dan Pengendalian Pembangunan (President\u2019s Delivery \nUnit  for  Development  Monitoring  and  Oversight).  The  government  is  now  revising  related \nregulations to improve budget execution. \n \n19.  Better  poverty  targeting  approach.  To  further  accelerate  the  pace  of  poverty \nreduction, the government is pursuing key reforms of its national poverty reduction programs to \nachieve  the  target  set  in  Rencana  Pembangunan  Jangka  Menengah  Nasional  (National \nMedium-Term Development Plan), 2010\u20132014. These efforts include establishing a national \ntargeting system to ensure that program benefits accurately reach the poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds.  Currently,  household  poverty  reduction  programs  use  different  targeting \napproaches and rely on separate recipient databases. This leads to duplication of efforts and \ninconsistency in application, and dampens program impact. The national targeting system will \nconstruct and maintain a unified targeting database, to be used by all programs, on potential \nbeneficiaries drawn from the poorest 40% of the population. The single source of quality-\ncontrolled data will help improve programs' targeting outcomes and boost synergies between \nprograms. A unified database also reduces fraud, corruption, and duplication, while simplifying \nprogram exit strategies. \n \nE.  Economic Impacts of the Government\u2019s Countercyclical Measures \n \n20.  Economic stimulus effects. While domestic consumption provides a good base for \nstable growth, a supportive external environment is essential for stronger growth dynamics \nthrough exports and investment. In 2011, net exports contributed 1.5 percentage points to the \n ", "  7\n   \ncountry\u2019s  economic  growth.  Dynamic  export  growth  also  stimulated  a  large  inflow  of  FDI. \nTherefore, if export growth stagnated, economic growth could be significantly reduced by about \n1 percentage point\u20131.5 percentage points. The fiscal stimulus package is required to mitigate \nthe potential impact of an export slowdown. Assuming that the average multiplier effect of the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal stimulus is close to one, the ideal size of the fiscal stimulus should be close \nto 1%\u20131.5% of GDP. In the context of Indonesia, this can be achieved through a combination of \nincreased spending and better budget execution.  In 2010\u20132011, the government was not able \nto optimally use the available fiscal space, ranging from 0.5% to 1% of GDP. Past experience \nalso suggests that an economic growth rate of above 6% per annum is necessary to ensure a \nsustained reduction in unemployment and poverty.  A stronger growth in 2011 reduced the \nnumber of people below the poverty line by 1.1 million (footnote 4). In addition, it led to a higher \nquality of job creation.  \n \nF.  Impact, Output, Scope, and Coverage  \n \n21  The impact of the facility will be to sustain the government\u2019s capacity to achieve pro-poor \neconomic growth over the medium term. The outcome will be sustained priority government \nspending and higher domestic demand. This will in turn generate jobs and sustain poverty \nreduction during a period of high global economic uncertainties. \n \n22.  Financing plan and ADB risk-bearing capacity. The government has requested a \nloan of $500,000,000 under the facility from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility plus 200 bps9 and a rebate or surcharge reflecting the cost of funds; a 5-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; annuity-style repayment option; commitment charge of 75 \nbps on the undisbursed loan balance; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. Based on \nthese loan terms and repayment option, the average loan maturity is 4.28 years and there is no \nmaturity premium payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with: (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n  \n23.  The facility loan is in line with ADB\u2019s long term capital adequacy framework.10 The facility \nloan, if approved, is expected to have a positive implication on ADB's medium to long term risk \nbearing capacity, based on its term of 5 years and market-based interest spread of 200 basis \npoints. For example, an immediate disbursement of $500 million could result in an improved \nequity-to-loan ratio of about 3\u20134 basis point by 2017 when the loan is fully repaid. \n \n24.  The government is committed to first meeting its financing need from market sources \nand will back up its intention with confidence-boosting policy measures. In this context, the \ngovernment has placed the task of reassuring financial markets at the top of its crisis response \nagenda. The government recognizes that maintaining financial market confidence is critical to its \nability to mobilize the necessary resources to finance public expenditures and to the overall \neconomic prospects of the country. Therefore, under both the baseline and the slower growth \nscenarios  (para.  7),  the  government  will  maintain  macroeconomic  stability  and  implement \nconfidence-boosting  policy  measures  such  as  the  bond  stabilization  framework  and  other \nmacroprudential measures to ensure financial market confidence. Under these two scenarios, \n                                                 \n9  Broadly in line with the recent spread between comparable government dollar bonds and the United States \nTreasury bill during normal periods. \n10  ADB.2008. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s Long-Term Capital Adequacy Framework. Manila.   \n ", " 8  \nthe facility and the other contingent financing support provided by development partners will not \nbe  withdrawn.  However,  the  package  adds  to  market  confidence  since  the  availability  of \nprecautionary financing in case of significant market turbulence will provide a strong positive \nsignal to the market. \n \n25.  The government will access the facility only under the crisis scenario. The financing \nplan, issued as a Directorate General of Debt Management (DGDM) Decree No. 21/PU/2012 \nissued in April 2012, sets out: (i) the government\u2019s financing targets for fiscal year 2012, (ii) the \nterms and circumstances under which the government will drawdown the facility and the related \nsupport from other development partners to meet its financing shortfall, and (iii) the terms under \nwhich the financing plan may be rolled over and reissued for fiscal year 2013. The government \nand  development  partners  will  constantly  review  these  parameters  using  governance \narrangements in the financing plan that allow the government and development partners to \nassess whether disbursement from the loans is required in line with the government\u2019s financing \nplan.  \n \nG.  Implementation Arrangements and Monitoring \n \n26.  The  DGDM  will  be  the  executing  agency  to  coordinate,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the \nimplementation  of  the  financing  plan  and  the  government\u2019s  countercyclical  fiscal  stimulus \nprograms  supported  by  the  loan.  DGDM  will  convene  a  quarterly  meeting  attended  by \nrepresentatives from the government and development partners to oversee the implementation \nof the financing plan. The monitoring of the fiscal stimulus programs will utilize the government \nsystem.  For  example,  for  infrastructure  spending,  the  government  has  also  assigned  the \nPresident\u2019s Delivery Unit for Development Monitoring and Oversight to monitor and coordinate \nits implementation. The government and development partners will meet each quarter to review \n(i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) implementation of the financing plan, (iii) the government\u2019s \ncountercyclical programs, and (iv) the government\u2019s financing shortfall. The coverage period for \nthe facility is from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2013. The loan of $500 million is to be disbursed \nwhen the government (i) has met the drawdown criteria set out in the government\u2019s financing \nplan; and (ii) maintain sound macroeconomic management.11 The proceeds of the loan will be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.12 \n \n27.  Under the financing plan, drawdown of the facility would be linked to Indonesia\u2019s access \nto market financing and will only occur if (a) the financing target has not been met and (b) \ngovernment bond yields are above a predetermined level. The financing plan reflects that, if a \ndrawdown  is  warranted  as  described  above,  the  government  will  request  support  from \ndevelopment partners to meet its financing needs. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the \ncost  (excluding  local  taxes  and  duties)  of  items  produced  and  procured  in  ADB  member \ncountries, excluding ineligible items.13 The full amount of the loan is not required at once. The \ngovernment has articulated a phased drawdown structure in line with its financing targets in its \nfinancing plan. Disbursement would be made once every quarter and only if the specified \nfinancing target has not been met given the specified thresholds for interest rates. \n \n                                                 \n11 Should adverse external shocks lead to an actual balance-of-payment crisis due to sustained capital outflows, the \nPFF loan would not be drawn down. Under this scenario, Indonesia would most likely seek access to a larger \nmacroeconomic package from other regional and international institutions in order to help support macroeconomic \nstability. \n12 ADB. 1998.

The government has made considerable progress in the legal and regulatory framework \nfor public financial management.  Since the enactment of the laws on State Finance, on State \nTreasury, and on State Audit in 2003\u20132004, most of the regulations underpinning the laws have \nbeen promulgated. Initial findings from the 2011 public expenditure and financial accountability \nrepeat assessment show a marked improvement in budget controls and reporting. In 2009, the \ngovernment achieved its first qualified audit opinion from the External Audit Agency, with around \n40%  of  ministries  and  agencies  achieving  unqualified  opinions.  ADB  is  building  on  this \nmomentum with continuing support to improve technical capacity and controls. Building on \nprevious programs, ADB technical assistance for Strengthening National Public Procurement \nProcesses14 has  been  committed  to  improve  the  transparency  and  efficiency  in  public \nprocurement processes. With the government\u2019s continuing commitment to reducing corruption, \nthe Transparency International\u2019s corruption perception index for Indonesia has improved to 3.0 \nin 2011, from 2.8 in 2010.15 \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The facility supports the government\u2019s efforts to sustain critical public expenditures on \ninfrastructure,  and  poverty  alleviation  and  social  protection.  In  addition,  the  countercyclical \nsupport includes a component to accelerate budget execution for infrastructure development, \nwhich will have a positive impact on the poor, since the government would then be able to more \neffectively use fiscal policy to stimulate demand and therefore dampen the negative impact of \nany external shocks. The facility will also support the government\u2019s crisis response program to \nhelp the poor and vulnerable during a crisis by improving monitoring, data collection, and the \ntargeting system. These actions are also expected to improve the ability of the government to \nput in place an emergency assistance plan to assist the poor in a relatively short time.16 \n \nC.  Safeguards \n30.  The  program  does  not  trigger  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the DGDM. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The facility assumes that the capacity of the government to execute capital expenditure \nwill improve as a means to ensure an optimal impact of the government fiscal stimulus during a \ncrisis. In addition, the facility also assumes that macroeconomic stability will be maintained \ndespite increasing global economic uncertainties. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2010.

Adverse Impact of    The Indonesian economy has been adversely affected by the eurozone sovereign debt crisis  p\ne\nthe Eurozone Crisis  and the economic slowdown in several ways. With increasing reliance on market financing,  n\nd\ngovernment  finances  have  been  more  vulnerable  to  the  deteriorating  external  market  ix\n 4\nconditions and increased market volatility. The economy has been affected by declining   \nexport growth since the last quarter of 2011. Although the economy is still resilient, the \ndownside risks to growth have increased significantly. With an uncertain and potentially \nweaker external environment, there is a compelling need to stimulate domestic demand in \norder to continue the current pace of poverty reduction.  \n  Economic growth  Economic  growth  accelerated  further  despite  weakening  external  demand  from  the \ndeteriorating sovereign debt situation. GDP growth edged up to 6.5% year-on-year in 2011, \nfrom 6.2% in 2010 supported by sustained private consumption and stronger investment. \nExport slowdown in Q4 was compensated by increased government\u2019s spending to prevent \ngrowth  from  declining.  However,  the  downside  risks  for  future  growth  have  increased \nsignificantly through weakening export growth. \n  Exports and  Export growth declined to 5.1% (year-on-year) Q1 2012 from 30.8% in Q1 2011. Investment \ninvestment  recorded a negative growth of 2.2% in Q4 2011. \n  Remittances  Remittances declined by 6.4% from $1.2 billion in Q4 2010 to $1.1 billion in Q4 2011. \n  Fiscal deficit  To accommodate the fiscal stimulus, the Government increased the budget deficit from 1.2% \nof GDP in 2011 to 1.5% in the 2012 Budget. The Parliament passed a revised 2012 budget \nwith a larger deficit of 2.2% in March 2012. \n  Tax revenue  Tax revenue collection was up by 0.7% of GDP in 2011, largely due to the efforts to widen \ncollection  the tax net and improve tax administration.  \n  Impact on sovereign  Non-residents  sold  a  large  amount  of  government  rupiah  securities  ($4.1  billion)  in \nbond yields  September and October 2011. Yields of government\u2019s 5-year government bond surged by \nabout 120 bps. Yields have gradually declined since the second week of October 2011 due \nto the government\u2019s bond stabilization programs. \nB. Countercyclical    The Government is implementing a countercyclical program that focuses on (i) increasing \nExpenditure Program  infrastructure spending, (ii) improving budget execution, and (iii) scaling up and improving the \ntargeting system of the flagship poverty programs. \n  Increased  The  2012  budget  increases  capital  expenditure  by  33.7%  from  the  2011  levels.  The \ninfrastructure  infrastructure spending includes development of airports, ports, mass rapid transport system, \nspending  new roads and hinterland connections. The Government is considering to include in the \nrevised budget additional infrastructure spending from the 2011 unspent balance.  \n  Social assistance  The Government has scaled up its National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM) for \nprograms  2012. In response to the current crisis, the government is establishing of a National Targeting \nSystem  to  ensure  that  program  benefits  more  accurately  reach  poor  and  vulnerable \nhouseholds. \n ", " \nINO-PFF  Access  Indicators  ADB Staff Assessment \nCriteria \nC. Sound    The Government has maintained sound macroeconomic management and introduced swift \nMacroeconomic  measures to mitigate the impact of the eurozone crisis and the global economic slowdown. \nManagement  This involved taking a number of preemptive measures aimed at maintaining the stability of \nthe domestic bond market and introducing macroprudential measures to manage speculative \ncapital inflows The Government also maintains flexibility in the 2012 budget to facilitate the \nneed to stimulate domestic demand while easing monetary policy appropriately to respond to \nweakening growth prospects. \n  Monetary policy and  After the inflation downward trend firmed up in the second half of 2011, Bank Indonesia \ninflation  started an easing cycle in October 2011 by cutting its policy rate by 100bps through February \n2012. The cuts were also taken to frontload some adjustment measures in response to the \nexpected global economic slowdown. Year-on-year inflation declined to 3.8% in December \n2011. The deceleration trend was reversed in March and the year-on-year inflation rate \nedged up to 4.5% in April.  \n  Adjustment policy  The Government introduced the Bond Stabilization Framework (BSF). The BSF includes a \nmeasures to address  number of actions to stabilize the domestic bond market in the event of market turbulence by \nthe financial crisis  buying back in the secondary market using: funds from the state budget; fund-pooling by \nstate-owned enterprises; accumulated budget surplus, and internal reserves accumulated by \nBank Indonesia. Under the BSF, the Government, in coordination with Bank Indonesia, \nbought back a significant amount of government bonds in the secondary market to stabilize \nbond yields. Bank Indonesia also implemented a number of macroprudential measures to \nreduce short-term and speculative capital inflows and mitigate the risks of sudden reversals. \n  Debt sustainability  Public debt is sustainable. Indonesia\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio has fallen steadily in the last \nanalysis  decade,  including  against  the  backdrop  of  the  2008-09  global  financial  crisis.  The \ncountercyclical spending program is not expected to adversely affect debt sustainability as a \nlarge proportion of the 2012 budget stimulus is devoted to additional infrastructure spending, \nwhich will improve the capacity to of the economy to grow higher in the medium term. Even \nwith a shock of a 10% increase in government debt liability in 2012, the debt ratio is projected \nto return to the current level by 2016. \n  Public financial  The  Government  has  an  aggressive  PFM  reform  program  supported  by  a  number  of \nmanagement  development partners including through ADB\u2019s earlier Development Policy Support Program \nsystems  series. Key reforms include strengthening the budgetary process, budget transparency, and \ncivil service reforms.  \n  External balance  The external balance position is strong. Gross international reserves at the end of April 2012 \nA\nwere $116.4 billion, sufficient for 6.4 months of imports and servicing of official external debt.  p\np\ne\nBSF bond stabilization framework, INO-PFF = precautionary financing facility, GDP = gross domestic product, PFM = public financial management,  n\nd\nPNPM = National Community Empowerment Program.  ix\nSource: Bank Indonesia, World Bank, and Asian Development Bank.   4\n  1          \n9\n \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20120615103739+07'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Keywords": "46239-001, rrp, reports and recommendations of the president, indonesia, financing, countercyclical support, public sector management, economic growth, ocr, macroeconomic stability, indonesia, global economic slowdowns, financial impacts, trade impacts, financial markets, eurozone crisis, adb projects", "ModDate": "D:20120618105958+08'00'", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "Subject": "Report and Recommendation of the President describing terms and conditions proposed for the proposed loan, 'Precautionary Financing Facility' in Indonesia for the approval of ADB's Board of Directors.
