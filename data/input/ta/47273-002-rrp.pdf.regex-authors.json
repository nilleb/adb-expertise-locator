I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nIntegrated Road Investment Program. \n \n2.  The investment program will improve the accessibility of the road network in rural areas \nof  Sri  Lanka,  and  thereby  increase  the  involvement  of  the  rural  population  in  nationwide \neconomic and social development.1 An integrated road network will support long-term rural \ndevelopment. The investment program will upgrade and maintain about 2,200 kilometers (km) of \nrural access roads to all-weather standard; rehabilitate and maintain to a good condition about \n400 km of national roads; and improve the capacity of road agencies\u2014including the Ministry of \nHighways, Ports and Shipping (MOHPS), the Road Development Authority (RDA), provincial \nroad  agencies,  and  local  authorities\u2014with  respect  to  road  asset  management,  project \nmanagement, and contract administration.2 The investment program  will play a catalytic role in \nthe sustainable development of Sri Lanka.  \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sri Lanka occupies a strategic position near the main sea trade routes between Asia and \nEurope, which allowed Colombo to develop as an international port city, and subsequently as a \ntransshipment point for cargo originating in or destined for the Indian subcontinent. The island \ncountry consists mostly of flat or rolling coastal plains, with mountains in the south\u2013central core. \nAbout 85% of Sri Lanka\u2019s population (20.3 million in 2012) lives in rural and peri-urban areas.3 \n \n4.  Sri Lanka has experienced strong economic growth following the end of civil conflict in \nMay 2009. Economic growth was 8% in 2010 and 2011; slowed to 6.4% in 2012 due to weak \nexternal demand, drought, and floods; and then rebounded to 7.3% in 2013. It is envisaged that \nan improving external environment, higher investment, and a recovery in domestic consumption \nwill sustain a rapid economic growth during 2014\u20132015.4 Sri Lanka\u2019s economic expansion has \nbeen driven by the industry and services sectors, which account for 89% of gross domestic \nproduct, followed by the agriculture sector, which contributed the remaining 11%.5 As a result of \nthe robust growth, the national poverty headcount ratio fell to just below 9% in 2010 from over \n15% in 2006. Nevertheless, less-developed areas did not exhibit consistently higher elasticity of \npoverty reduction (proportional change in poverty per unit growth in gross domestic product per \ncapita).6 The poor transport infrastructure, in particular the provincial and local authority roads, \nhas hindered the spread of economic activities and access to basic social resources. \n \n5.  Sector road map. Sri Lanka\u2019s road network is dense and well laid out, providing basic \naccess to the country\u2019s population and economic activity centers. The 132,693 km road network \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Integrated Road \nOperation and Development Investment Program (TA 8473-SRI). \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  World Bank and United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat). 2012.

Sri Lanka: 2013 Article IV Consultation and Proposal for Post-Program \nMonitoring. Washington, DC. ", "2   \nin  Sri  Lanka  is  classified  into  national,  provincial,  and  local  authority  roads,  according  to \nadministrative responsibility.7 Notable progress has been achieved since 2007 in addressing the \nimmediate  trunk  road  network  deficiencies,8 but  progress  on  provincial  and  rural  roads  is \nrelatively slow.9 The main challenges facing road connectivity are that most rural access roads, \nincluding provincial and local roads, cannot provide all-weather access, and part of the trunk \nroad network is in poor condition. These issues arise because of (i) competition for budget \nallocations with other sectors; (ii) inadequate fundraising in both the public and private sectors; \n(iii) inadequate rural road design standards and construction specifications; and (iv) the limited \ncapacity of road agencies, particularly at the provincial and local levels. \n \n6.  A road asset management system is functioning in RDA to plan and program road \nprojects. The government established a road maintenance trust fund in 2005. The fund has \nserved a useful purpose in terms of securing a maintenance budget, and raising awareness of \nthe importance of maintenance. In the long term, the government plans to expand the fund to \ncover provincial and rural roads, but this will require that a harmonized approach to road asset \nmanagement be adopted by the various road agencies. \n \n7.  Strategic  context.  The  government\u2019s  national  strategy  for  2010\u20132020  aims  to \naccelerate  economic  growth,  improve  social  indicators,  eradicate  hard-core  poverty,  and \nimprove the environment.10 Inadequate, poor-quality infrastructure is identified by the strategy \nas a major constraint to sustaining rapid economic growth, and the strategy places the highest \npriority on improving the country\u2019s road network. The road network development investment in \n2011 at national, provincial, and local levels was about six times higher in nominal terms than in \n2005. The public investment strategy proposes to sustain annual public investment at more than \n$1.3 billion until 2016, which would thereafter help develop and maintain the road network.11 \n \n8.  In line with the government\u2019s national strategy, the country partnership strategy 2012\u2013\n2016  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  aims  to  address  the  major  constraints  for \nsustaining inclusive growth in post-war Sri Lanka.12 The transport sector is one of the key areas \nin implementing the strategy. As agreed with the government, ADB will contribute to the sector \noutcome of improved nationwide connectivity. \n \n9.  Policy  framework.  The  central  government  is  responsible  for  transport  policy  and \ninterprovincial (national) road transport infrastructure. Provincial governments are responsible \nfor provincial roads, and local authorities for the local authority roads. The government has \nadopted a two-tier strategy to provide nationwide connectivity: (i) establishing a trunk road \nnetwork with expressways and well-connected national roads, and (ii) completing a rural road \nnetwork to connect the rural population to trunk roads. RDA\u2019s project management capacity has \nbeen well developed through large-scale projects, beginning in 2007. A skills transfer program is \n                                                 \n7  National roads, comprising about 11,922 km of class A and class B roads, are managed by the central government \nthrough the RDA. The provincial road network, comprising 15,975 km of class C and class D roads, is managed by \nthe provincial councils. In addition, about 80,000 km of local roads (class E) are managed by local governments. \n8  The proportion of national roads in good condition rose from 35% in 2007 to 48% in 2011, those in fair condition \ndropped from 19% to 11%, and those in poor condition declined from 46% to 41%. \n9  The government has established Maga Neguma, a rural road program, to improve rural roads through RDA. The \nprogram has improved about 10,000 km of rural roads at the request of local authorities since 2004, but about 90% \nof the rural road network still requires rehabilitation. \n10 Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Finance and Planning, Department of National Planning. 2010.

The development of the national road network is guided by the national road master \nplan.13 Improvements to rural access roads, including provincial and local authority roads, are \nscheduled  annually  to  address  the  community  demands.  To  supplement  the  capacity  of \nprovincial governments and local authorities, RDA, the provincial road agencies, and the local \nauthority jointly implement rural road improvement works. \n \n10.  In line with the two-tier strategy, the government plans to implement an investment plan \nfor rural road connectivity. The plan is designed to provide physical infrastructure and capacity \nto enhance the road connectivity of rural areas. About 1,000 rural communities will be selected \nas rural hubs according to their population and development potential. Access routes\u2014including \nlocal  authority,  provincial,  and  national  roads\u2014will  be  upgraded  or  rehabilitated.  The  total \ninvestment  demand  is  about  $1.8  billion.  The  government  requests  that  ADB  finance  the \nprogram  in  five  provinces  (Southern  Province,  Sabaragamuwa  Province,  Central  Province, \nNorth Central Province, and North Western Province) and one rural district (Kalutara District of \nWestern  Province).  The  government  has  also  requested  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency to finance projects in the other areas to complement ADB\u2019s assistance.  \n \n11.  The investment program is in line with the government\u2019s sector objective of establishing \na modern transport system. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality for the investment \nprogram because it will allow long-term partnership between the government and ADB on policy \ndialogue and capacity development within a large-scale program.14 A portfolio review of ADB-\nfunded road projects confirmed that the implementation capacity in Sri Lanka is adequate. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  improved  connectivity  between  rural \ncommunities and socioeconomic centers in Sri Lanka. The outcome will be increased transport \nefficiency on project roads. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n13.  The investment program will deliver two outputs: (i) improved road conditions between \nthe selected rural communities and socioeconomic centers, and (ii) enhanced capacity of road \nagencies. The two outputs will be achieved through two components of the investment program. \n(i)  Road  improvement  component.  This  component  will  design,  improve,  and \nmaintain about 2,200 km of rural access roads, including provincial and local \nauthority roads, and about 400 km of national roads. The rural access roads will \nbe improved to all-weather standards, and be maintained for 3 years. Selected \nnational road corridors will be improved and/or maintained for 7 years, while \nshort, isolated sections will be maintained for 3 years after improvement. \n(ii)  Capacity development component. This component will build the capacity of \nroad agencies in road asset management, project management, and contract \nadministration. RDA will take the lead in developing a harmonized approach to \nroad asset management in central, provincial, and local governments. Consulting \nservices will be engaged to assist with development of the RDA\u2019s capacity, and \nthe transfer of skills from RDA to provincial and local road agencies.  \n                                                 \n13  RDA, Planning Division. 2007.

Interest during construction for Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nloan(s) has been computed at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.5% for the \nordinary capital resources loan, and at 2.0% per annum for the loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \nCommitment charges for the ordinary capital resources loan(s) are 0.15% per year to be charged on the \nundisbursed OCR loan amount. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16.  The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $800 million equivalent from \nADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Funds resources to help finance part of the \ninvestment program, including civil works contracts (improvement and maintenance), consulting \nservices, project management, and part of the contingencies.16 The MFF will consist of multiple \ntranches,  subject  to  the  government's  submission  of  related  periodic  financing  requests, \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements for each tranche, and fulfillment of terms \nand  conditions  and  undertakings  set  forth  in  the  framework  financing  agreement.17 The \ngovernment will finance the feasibility study and engineering design, taxes and duties, and part \nof the contingencies, for a total of $106 million. In addition, the government has requested \nJapan International Cooperation Agency to finance projects in the remaining areas of the other \nfour provinces (Northern Province, Eastern Province, Uva Province, and Western Province) so \nthat the whole country will be covered. \n \n                                                 \n15 List of Projects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 About $21 million of performance-based maintenance under civil works contracts will be financed by the MFF to \nsupport the government in exploring a sustainable contract model of road operation and maintenance. This support \nwill also alleviate the government\u2019s budget and capacity constraints on road maintenance. \n17 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "     5 \n \n17.  The  MFF  combines  OCR  and  Asian  Development  Fund  (ADF)  financing  up  to  the \naggregate  MFF  amount.  The  provision  of  any  ADF  resources  will  be  balanced  by  a \ncorresponding  reduction  in  available  OCR  financing  (and  vice  versa),  with  total  financing \nprovided under the MFF not to exceed the aggregate MFF total of $800 million equivalent. Any \nADF allocation will be subject to (i) the availability of ADF resources; (ii) Sri Lanka\u2019s access to \nsuch resources pursuant to ADB\u2019s Graduation Policy,18 and the requirements of ADF donors; \nand (iii) the availability of such resources to Sri Lanka given ADB\u2019s policy on performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources.19 \n \n18.  Disbursement-based approach and time-slice financing. The financing plan and an \nindicative tranche schedule are in Table 2. The MFF will finance slices of long-term contract \npackages under the investment program. Each tranche will finance slices of a group of contracts \nfor civil works or consulting services. Each contract is sliced according to the indicative tranche \nschedule.20 The  amount  of  each  tranche  will  be  requested  according  to  the  disbursement \nprogress and projection. The tranche schedule is based on the disbursement projection to \nimprove the disbursement ratio and minimize financing charges. \n \n19.  The preconstruction activities, such as appraisal and procurement, will be all advanced \nto the first 2\u20133 years of the investment program. The government has completed preparation \nand due diligence for project 1, and will complete the preparation of other projects by October \n2014. Following the disbursement-based approach, the government intends to request tranche \n1 together with the facility to finance the first slice of project 1, and to request tranche 2 by the \nend of 2014 to finance the first slice of other projects. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nIndicative Tranche Schedule and Amount ($ million) \nAmount  Share of  1  2  3  4  5  6 \nSource  ($ million)  Total (%)  (2014)  (2014)  (2016)  (2017)  (2018)  (2020) \nAsian Development Bank  800.0  88.3  100.0  100.0  200.0  150.0  150.0  100.0 \nGovernment  106.0  11.7  18.0  15.0  25.0  18.0  18.0  12.0 \nTotal  906.0  100.0  118.0  115.0  225.0  168.0  168.0  112.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n22.  Engineering design has been carried out for all project roads under project 1 based on \nsite  condition  surveys,  field  investigations,  and  climate  risk  assessment.23 The  engineering \n                                                 \n23 Climate Risk Assessment and Management Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "     7 \n \ndesigns are optimized for economy and construction efficiency in accordance with international \nand  national  design  standards.  For  provincial  and  rural  roads,  a  context-sensitive  design \napproach  is  adopted  to  incorporate  community  concerns.  Construction  will  use  proven \ntechnology and standard materials compatible with local conditions. Project 1 of the investment \nprogram has two groups of civil works contracts: (i) conventional road contracts, including \nconstruction and 3-year performance-based maintenance; and (ii) road management contracts, \nincluding 7 years of rehabilitation and maintenance to deliver a predefined level of services. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n23.  In addition to the large vehicle operating cost and time savings, all-weather rural access \nroad will result in significant benefits, such as increased agriculture productivity, easier access \nto health and education, poverty reduction, and better employment opportunities for the rural \npopulation.  These  social  benefits  are  not  captured  by  the  conventional  economic  analysis \nmodel. Therefore, an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) threshold of 10% is adopted for \nrural access roads. For national roads, a threshold of 12% EIRR is used. The economic analysis \nof project 1 indicated it is economically viable, with an overall EIRR of 19.1%.24 A sensitivity \nanalysis on capital costs, benefits, and implementation delays confirmed its economic viability. \n \n24.  The unit costs related to operation and maintenance of project roads will decrease after \nconstruction is completed. Recent trends indicate that future budget allocations for national \nroads will be adequate. The government envisages that in the long term, the road maintenance \ntrust fund will allow access by provincial and local road agencies. The investment program will \nbuild the capacity of provincial and local road agencies to facilitate the process of granting \naccess of the trust fund to non-national roads, and to enhance their financial sustainability. \n \nC.  Governance \n25.  Policy and legal. The implementation arrangements of the investment program will \ninvolve  three  levels  of  government:  central,  provincial,  and  local.  At  the  central  level,  the \nMOHPS is responsible for the formulation of policies and performance monitoring. RDA was \nestablished as a statutory authority with a separate legal status by the Road Development \nAuthority Act in 1981. RDA\u2019s chairperson reports to the secretary of MOHPS. At the provincial \nand local levels, the provincial councils are responsible for the work of the respective local \nauthorities within the provincial councils, under the 13th amendment to the Constitution enacted \nin 1987 and the Pradheshiya Sabha Act No 15 in 1987. In keeping with the devolution norm of \nSri Lanka, RDA acts as if contracted by the provincial authorities to construct roads that belong \nto the local authorities, and a memorandum of understanding to this effect will be executed. The \narrangements follow existing practice in Sri Lanka, where local authorities generally lack the \ncapacity and resources for such projects. \n \n26.  The implementation arrangements satisfy the RDA Act, which requires that RDA consult \nwith other government agencies regarding projects within their respective areas. The national \nsteering committee and provincial coordination committees will ensure proper coordination. \n \n27.  Institutional capacity. MOHPS and RDA have sufficient capacity, past experience, and \ninstitutional strength to procure the civil works, select consultants, and administer contracts. \nParticipation  of  provincial,  district  and  local  authorities  in  the  steering  and  coordination \ncommittees has been arranged, with consideration of their respective institutional capacity. \n                                                 \n24 Economic and Financial Analysis: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \n \n28.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was carried out for RDA. \nRDA has prior and ongoing experience implementing ADB-funded projects. It has satisfactory \ncapacity in project financial accounting and in ADB disbursement procedures. RDA has a \ndedicated project accounting and finance team with suitably qualified accountants. RDA will \nestablish and maintain separate project records and accounts to identify the financing resources \nreceived and expenditures made for the project, thus ensuring an adequate audit trail. The \ngovernment\u2019s Auditor General\u2019s Department will annually audit the project accounts and related \nfinancial statements in accordance with international auditing standards. \n \n29.  Procurement  and  anticorruption.  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 \n(as amended from time to time), the Declaration of Asset and Liabilities Act, No. 1 of 1975, and \nthe Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption Act, No. 19 of \n1994 provide a legal basis to deal with bribery and corruption. The auditor general monitors \nprocurement activities. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the MOHPS, and RDA. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the facility administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  Poverty  reduction  and  social  impacts.  Project  1  will  improve  the  socioeconomic \nsituation and enhance poverty reduction in Southern Province. About 1.2 million people live in \nthe 45 divisions within project areas. Consultation and social surveys were conducted along all \nproject roads, and covered 4,899 households (approximately 38% of the households along the \nproject roads), with 14 focus group discussions. The current road conditions were described as \nbad by 80% of surveyed households. Communities indicated that the poor conditions prevented \nsafe travel, and cited that positive benefits will include improved access to education and health, \nbetter  transport  services,  and  increased  job  opportunities.  Communities  will  be  consulted \nthrough a transect walk to ensure that the final design of provincial and rural roads incorporate \ntheir concerns on construction, social and environmental issues, and road safety.25 \n \n31.  Gender  and  development. The country now ranks midway on the United Nations \ngender-related development index. The social study found that women were actively engaged in \nfamily and community activities and decision-making processes: 80% always participating in \nfamily  decision  making,  54%  contributed  to  household income,  and  53%  were  involved  in \ncommunity activities. Sixty-two percent of women stated they were willing to participate in the \nproject through (i) working as maintenance laborer or civil works wage laborer, and (ii) operating \na  small  business  to  provide  services  to  contractors.  Women  indicated  that  improved  road \naccessibility will provide better access to health, education, social, and economic opportunities. \nA gender action plan has been prepared for project 1.26 Gender mainstreaming activities include \n(i) ensuring that at least 40% of the people consulted in the final design of rural access roads \nare women; (ii) integrating features that increase safety and meet the needs of the elderly, \nwomen, children and the disabled; (iii) ensuring that at least 30% of local employees hired for \nroad maintenance are women and that they receive equal wages for equal work; (iv) providing \ntraining in road maintenance to all employed women; and (v) encouraging women\u2019s participation \nin awareness campaigns on road safety, sexually transmitted infections, and human trafficking. \n                                                 \n25 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n26 Gender Action Plan: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "     9 \n \n \n32.  HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The HIV prevalence rate is low in Sri Lanka. The \nestablishment of the National Program for Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS Control \nhelps refurbish health clinics and establish outreach and awareness programs. This investment \nprogram has incorporated measures to mitigate HIV/AIDS risks by undertaking awareness \ntraining for civil works contractors and for project-affected communities at prominent village \nlocations. Awareness-raising activities will be conducted separately for men and women. The \nsocial impact assessment did not identify human trafficking as a significant issue in the project \narea. It is anticipated that civil works contractors will hire local laborers and not require migrant \nworkers. Affected communities will be provided with awareness training on human trafficking. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  Involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. Project 1 is classified as category \nB in involuntary resettlement in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nimprovement of rural access roads and national roads will be within the existing alignment with \nno widening. Due diligence for project 1 identified no impacts to land, structures, private trees, \nor community resource properties.27 However, resettlement impacts may be encountered at a \nlater stage of the 7-year road management contract. A grievance redressal mechanism will be \nset up in all project areas. A resettlement framework has been prepared to guide compliance \nwith social safeguard requirements in succeeding projects.28 If land is required for the rural \naccess roads when implementing succeeding projects, the voluntary land donation system will \nbe used. The system has been used effectively under other rural development programs in Sri \nLanka.  Specific  procedural  requirements  for  land  donation,  involving  comprehensive \nconsultations with the communities, have been prepared in the resettlement framework. The \ngovernment will ensure that land donation is undertaken without coercion and documented in a \ntransparent manner, and will have the process verified by an independent monitor. For national \nroads  requiring  land,  acquisition  will  take  place  in  accordance  with  requirements  of  the \ngovernment and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, per the resettlement framework. Project 1 \nis not expected to impact indigenous peoples and is consequently designated category C. An \nindigenous  peoples  planning  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  the  planning  and \npreparation of future projects.29  The due diligence report, the resettlement framework and the \nindigenous peoples planning framework have been disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n34.  Environmental impact. The scope of works under project 1 involves rehabilitation and \nmaintenance of existing rural and national roads. Therefore project 1 has been designated \ncategory B in accordance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement. A consolidated provincial-\nlevel initial environmental examination (IEE) report has been prepared,30 and an environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  has  been  prepared  to  guide  compliance  with  the \nenvironmental  safeguard  requirements  of  the  government  and  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement in succeeding projects.31 The IEE and the environmental assessment and review \nframework fulfill ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements and have been disclosed on \nthe  ADB  website.  Anticipated  environmental  impacts  under  project  1  entail  typical  road \nconstruction-related issues such as generation of dust, noise, exhaust, waste from construction \nsites and worker camps, water contamination, occupational health and safety, erosion, and \nsiltation. Mitigation measures have been included in a standard environmental management \n                                                 \n27 Resettlement Due Diligence Report: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Indigenous Peoples Planning Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Initial Environmental Examination: Project 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nplan (EMP) as part of the IEE. The contractor will be required to prepare contract package-\nspecific  EMPs  based  on  their  final  design,  road-specific  environment  checklists,  and  the \nstandard EMP. Consultations have been conducted during the project preparation, and the IEE \nincorporates the concerns of the affected persons and stakeholders. \n \n35.  RDA has an experienced environment and social development division to manage both \nsafeguard issues, and a safeguard team from the division will be deputed under the project \nimplementation unit. The unit will also be supported by consultants for monitoring and reporting \non safeguard implementation. Safeguard training workshops will be held regularly. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The  overall  risk  assessment  is  medium  without  mitigation  and  low  with  mitigation. \nIntegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are detailed in the risk assessment and risk management plan.32 The key risk is \nfrequent implementation delays resulting from the need to prepare detailed engineering designs \nand prolonged land acquisition and resettlement. To mitigate this risk, engineering design and \nbidding documents have been prepared in advance, and land requirements minimized. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n37.  The government, the MOHPS, and the RDA have assured ADB that implementation of \nthe investment program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the facility administration manual and loan documents. \n \n38.  The government, the MOHPS, and the RDA have given ADB certain undertakings for \nthe MFF, which are set forth in the framework financing agreement. Specific covenants agreed \nby the government, the MOHPS, and the RDA with respect to individual tranches under the \nMFF are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement for the respective tranches. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the multitranche financing facility to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for \nthe Integrated Road Investment Program in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the \nequivalent of $800,000,000, which comprises: \n(i)  the provision of loans from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with interest and \nother  terms  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB's  applicable  policies \nrelating to Special Funds resources; and \n(ii)  the provision of loans from ADB's ordinary capital resources, with interest and \nother terms to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility \nand is subject to such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the framework financing agreement presented to the Board. \n \n                  Takehiko Nakao \n                  President \n3 September 2014\n                                                 \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).
