In its Midterm Development Framework (MTDF), the Government of Pakistan (Government) \nunderscored the importance of mega cities to national development. The MTDF acknowledged that, \nin the contemporary age of global competition among the world\u2019s cities, Pakistan\u2019s development \nincreasingly depends on the potential of its mega cities to attract private investment by offering high-\nquality public services and good governance. The MTDF reaffirmed the Government's commitment \nto developing its large cities as competitive, sustainable centers. The Government formed a high-\nlevel committee, chaired by the Planning Commission, for coordinated development of mega cities, \nstarting with Karachi as the central plank of its long-term development strategy.  \n \n2.  Given  the  immense  size  of  the  mega  city  Karachi,  the  magnitude  of  its  investment \nrequirements, and the scale of the need for policy reforms, both the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the Government have recognized that the needs of the mega city cannot be addressed with a \none-off approach, but rather require a series of appropriately sequenced interventions. Accordingly, \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update (CSPU) for 2005\u20132006 included a technical assistance \n(TA) loan in 2005, to be followed by an investment loan in the 2006. The TA loan, which is currently \nbeing  processed,  aims  to  establish  a  foundation  for  effectively  utilizing  and  sustaining  future \ninvestments in the mega city through support for long-term capacity building, a facility for project \npreparation, and a mechanism for sustainable financing of the mega-city infrastructure. The policy \ndialogue  held  during  the  processing  of  the  TA  loan,  indicated  strong  commitment  from  the \nGovernment to accelerating reforms for sustainable financing of mega-city infrastructure through \nestablishing a specialized financing vehicle (SFV). ADB has agreed to support the feasibility and \ndesign of a financing vehicle under a project preparatory TA that will also prepare a mega-city \ninvestment project for possible ADB financing. \n \n3.  A fact-finding mission visited Karachi and Islamabad from 6 to 10 September 2005 to \nformulate  the  TA 1  for  the  Mega  City  Sustainable  Development  Project.  The  Mission  met \nrepresentatives of the federal, provincial (Sindh Province), and city district (Karachi) governments \nand other stakeholders. Based on discussions with stakeholders, a review of related documents, and \nthe experience of earlier ADB assistance in Pakistan, the Mission reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the scope, costs, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA. The \npreliminary design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  With 34% of its population living in urban areas, Pakistan is the most urbanized country in \nSouth Asia. It has an urban population of 52 million, projected to increase to 63 million in 2010. \nKarachi, Pakistan's main commercial hub and trade center, is among the 30 largest cities in the \nworld. Its estimated population of 12.5 million is growing at a rate of 4.5% per annum. Karachi \naccounts for 95% of Pakistan\u2019s foreign trade and 30% of Pakistan\u2019s industrial production. Almost \n90% of the head offices of financial institutions and multinational companies are located in Karachi. \nThe city generates about 20% of the national output, creates more than 30% of value added in large-\nscale manufacturing, and accounts for 25% of national revenues. More importantly, the city provides \njobs for a large population - 40% of national employment in large-scale manufacturing is based in \nKarachi. \n \n5.  However,  the  potential  of  the  mega  city  to  contribute  to  the  economic  and  social \ndevelopment of the country has been severely constrained by a deteriorating urban environment and \ndeclining livability. Development is taking place haphazardly. Urban infrastructure and services are \ndeficient. While an estimated 82% of households have access to the water supply network, water is \navailable only for a few hours every other day. An estimated 89% of households have toilets, but the \nsewerage network suffers from poor connectivity and disrepair. Sewerage treatment is inadequate, \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 3 October 2005. \n ", "2   \nwith much of the untreated wastewater being discharged into the stormwater drainage system, rivers, \nor the sea. Only about 60% of the solid waste generated is lifted; of this, no more than 25% makes it \nto one of the two landfill sites. Large portions of the drainage network are used for waste disposal. \nThere is no mass transit system and the city residents rely almost entirely on the road network with \nrapidly increasing numbers of vehicles leading to congestion and increasing rates of road accidents. \nVehicle-generated  air  pollution,  depletion  and  pollution  of  water  resources,  flooding,  and  land \ncontamination are among the major environmental problems adversely affecting the health of city \nresidents, especially the poor. About 40% of the city residents live in squatter settlements with limited \nor no public services (see the poverty and social analysis in Appendix 2). Inadequate urban services \ndrive up costs for businesses and slow urban economic growth. In short, haphazard development \nand environmental deterioration compromise the key role the mega city should be playing in the \ndevelopment of Pakistan.  \n \n6.  The poor performance in the provision of infrastructure and services in the mega city of \nKarachi  is  largely  an  outcome  of  inadequate  institutional  and  financial  frameworks.  The \nGovernment\u2019s devolution reforms of 2001, which transferred functional, fiscal, and administrative \nauthority to local governments, ushered in a need for more effective service delivery and better \ngovernance at the local level. The city district government of Karachi (CDGK) became the central \nplayer in managing the city\u2019s affairs, while the town municipal administrations (TMAs) of 18 towns \nwere tasked with core municipal functions. Although the devolution provided good opportunities for \nimproved service delivery, it left many issues to be addressed, including (i) unclear and incomplete \nallocation of responsibilities between different levels of government, (ii) the inadequate capacity of \nthe city and its towns to fully meet their new responsibilities, and (iii) a fiscal imbalance and limited \nlocal revenues. \n \n7.  It is essential to undertake further reforms if the devolution is to yield the intended benefits \nfor improved mega-city governance and service delivery. Such reforms should include (i) clarification \nof roles and responsibilities among levels of government, as well as within the CDGK; (ii) addressing \nthe fiscal imbalance within the devolved setup; (iii) resource mobilization at the local level and a \nsupportive foundation for appropriate tariff schedules; (iv) an improved regulatory framework for city \nplanning, management, and  service delivery; (v) corporate reforms for infrastructure and service \nprovision  within  CDGK  and  its  utilities;  (vi)  improved  financial  management;  and  (vii)  better \npreparation and management of bankable projects so that assets are created quickly and revenues \nfrom  investments  accrue  without  delay.  The  TA  loan  being  currently  processed  is  aimed  at \nsupporting  these  reforms  through  its  emphasis  on  building  the  capacity  of  city  agencies  and \nimproving project preparation. \n \n8.  It is also increasingly recognized by all levels of government that traditional sources of \nfunds are not sufficient to meet the huge infrastructure needs of the mega city. The CDGK\u2019s and \nTMAs own-source revenues, made up of property taxes, land revenues, entertainment taxes, and \nservice charges, cannot even meet the cost of operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure, \nlet alone new capital investments. Allocations from the provincial and federal governments only \nscratch  the  surface  of  the  massive  infrastructure  needs  of  the  city.  The  CDGK's  midterm \ndevelopment plan estimates that Karachi requires about $1.165 billion in short-term infrastructure \ninvestments.  Based  on  methodology  that  relates  per  capita  income growth  to  expanded  urban \ninfrastructure needs, estimates suggest that from $0.5 billion to $1.0 billion per year is required to \nmaintain an adequate stock of infrastructure in Karachi. \n \n9.  The funding gap in meeting the city\u2019s infrastructure requirements will need to be met \nthrough  alternative  financing.  The  State  Bank  of  Pakistan's  recently  published  Guidelines  for \nInfrastructure Project Financing2 seem to recognize this. These guidelines aim to make it easier for \nbanks and development finance institutions to finance infrastructure. However, existing financial \n                                                 \n2 State Bank of Pakistan. 2004. Guidelines for Infrastructure Project Financing. Karachi. \n ", "  3\ninstitutions  have  limited  experience  with  the  types  of  financing  needed  for  urban  infrastructure \nprojects.  They  are  also  unwilling  to  lend  money  for  urban  infrastructure  projects  because  of \nperceived repayment risks. Conversely, neither the CDGK nor TMAs have any direct experience with \ncommercial financing and capacity to operate within the hard budget constraints associated with and \nrequired by commercial lending and private financing. Hence, there is a need for a dedicated \nfinancing entity3 specializing in urban infrastructure that could prepare Karachi city agencies to \naccess  commercial  financing,  and  translate  the  need  for  nongovernment  financing  into  actual \ndemand. \n \n10.  Experience4 with similar financing vehicles, both within and outside the region, suggests \nthat  when  designed  and  resourced  in  an  appropriate  manner,  such  vehicles  can  be  important \ncatalysts  in  commercializing  the  provision  of  infrastructure.  Through  tying  funds  allocation  to \ncommercial principles, an SFV can provide an incentive mechanism for enhancing tariff structures, \nenforcing financial discipline, improving budgeting, auditing, and disclosure standards, and improving \ncredit worthiness at the CDGK, TMAs, and their utilities. The SFV can also help create a local debt \nculture by allowing the CDGK and TMAs to gain experience with credit and establish a reliable track \nrecord for future borrowings. CDGK and its utilities can then begin to make the transition toward \ncommercial financing of infrastructure and services. In the medium to long term, with enhanced local \ncapacities and a maturing financial market, the SFV can act as an agent to mobilize funds from \nnongovernment  sources,  including  international  finance  institutions,  domestic  and  international \ncommercial lenders, and capital markets for mega-city infrastructure and services. \n \n11.  Despite its massive investment needs, the mega city has received little assistance from \nADB to date. In the past the World Bank has given Karachi assistance in the water supply and power \nsectors. The Government of Japan recently became active in supporting projects related to water \nsupply, sewerage, transport, and mega-city planning. ADB\u2019s only two loan projects5 were 20 years \nago  and  15  years  ago.  Those  projects,  which  were  evaluated  as  \u201cunsuccessful\u201d  and  \u201cpartially \nsuccessful\u201d, showed that there is a need for (i) greater attention to sustainability, (ii) enhanced \nproject design, (iii) careful consideration of institutional shortcomings, and (iv) greater efforts to \naddress the problem of financial insolvency within Karachi local government bodies. These lessons \nsuggest that piecemeal approaches to urban development are likely to fail. To be of lasting value, \ncapital investments need to be supported by policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional reforms, \ncapacity building, and innovative financing mechanisms that facilitate sustainable provision of high \nquality infrastructure and services. \n \n12.  Mega city development requires a holistic approach that entails (i) long-term, integrated \ninvestments  in  improved  urban  infrastructure and  services;  (ii)  additional  reforms  for  enhanced \nmega-city governance and management; and (iii) innovative financing mechanisms for mega-city \ndevelopment. The TA is needed to (i) conduct a feasibility and design analysis of an SFV for the \nmega  city  infrastructure  and  services,  and  (ii)  assess  the  feasibility  of  an  investment  loan  for \nimproving and expanding infrastructure and services in the mega city. The TA conforms with ADB\u2019s \nCSPU  for  2006\u20132008  which  emphasize  good  governance,  sustainable  economic  growth,  and \ninclusive development. \n \n                                                 \n3  This was a major finding and proposal of ADB. 2005.

The expected impact of the TA is to improve the quality of life for mega city residents, \nincluding the poor, in a sustainable manner. The anticipated outcomes are (i) an agreed-upon design \nand action plan to establish and operationalize an SFV for the mega city, and (ii) an investment loan \nproject for mega-city infrastructure and services development that is suitable for ADB financing. The \nTA will have two overlapping parts: (i) part A: Specialized Financing Vehicle; and (ii) part B: Mega \nCity Investment Project. \n \n14.  Part A will assess the feasibility and design of an SFV that will (i) in the short term, act as \nan efficient conduit to channel development funds, including ADB funds, to Karachi\u2019s infrastructure \nand  services;  (ii)  be  a  catalyst  in  the  transition  toward  commercial  financing  of  mega  city \ninfrastructure and services; and (iii) in the medium to long term, mobilize funds from nongovernment \nsources to finance the mega city's large-scale infrastructure needs. \n \n15.   Part B will support the feasibility assessment of and proposal for an investment project \nplaced  into  a  broader  mega  city  development  context,  including  a  medium  term  mega  city \ninfrastructure investment plan and an agenda for policy and institutional reforms. The investment \nproject will address the urban infrastructure and service needs in a programmatic manner, and will \nleverage reforms for more effective and sustainable service delivery in the mega city. Given the need \nfor an integrated, long-term approach to mega-city development and the need for significant policy \nand  institutional  reforms,  the  ensuing  project  is  expected  to  adopt  the  modality  of  a  sector \ndevelopment program or sector loan. The ensuing project will complement and benefit from the TA \nLoan Project which will support preparing subprojects and building capacity within city agencies. The \nproject will also have synergies with the Private Participation in Infrastructure Development (PPID) \nProject currently being processed by ADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  Part A of the TA will undertake a full-scale feasibility assessment and design of an SFV. \nThe work will build on preliminary assessments undertaken by a small-scale TA (footnote 3). Part A \nwill develop design features, the legal structure, a strategic road map, and SFV product and service \ntypes. A financial analysis will be carried out to ensure the SFV\u2019s viability and sustainability. More \nspecifically, part A will include (i) a full analysis of economic and financial market conditions and \ntrends; (ii) an analysis of the potential SFV market and the quality of potential borrowers and projects; \n(iii) an evaluation of design features, followed by the selection of an overall SFV design that best \nmeets Karachi\u2019s needs; (iv) selection of an existing financial intermediary, government partners \nand/or private sector partners to work on the detailed design of the SFV; (v) a marketing plan; (vi) an \nestimate of the financing required to make the SFV operational and viable; (vii) a detailed financial \nanalysis, including identification of risks and uncertainties; (viii) preparation of the business case and \nbusiness plan; (ix) a strategic road map for SFV; and (x) preparation of the operations manual. \nOwnership and management structures of the SFV will be carefully designed to ensure professional, \nautonomous management and strong representation of stakeholders at the board level, which will \nmaximize the vehicle's positive effect on reforms. Due attention will be paid to analyzing the role of \nthe SFV within the current governance framework to ensure that the SFV enhances the devolved \nstructure. The SFV's role in providing technical services for preparing bankable projects will be \nassessed and the institutional modality of such services will be determined. The TA will also identify \nnecessary time-bound reforms that various levels of government need to undertake in order to \nestablish the SFV. \n \n17.  Under part B, the TA will assess the feasibility of a loan combining long-term investments \nwith critically needed reforms. The TA will (i) elaborate the analysis of mega city policies, institutions, \ngovernance, and management structures that were undertaken during the processing of the TA loan; \n ", "  5\n(ii)  develop  the  mega  city  reform  agenda;  (iii)  develop  an  updated  medium-term  mega  city \ninfrastructure  investment  program  providing  coherent  and  progressive  framework  for  integrated \ninvestments; and (iv) select the first set of high-priority, bankable subprojects, whose feasibility will \nbe completed under the TA. The TA will further assess the use of the multi-tranche financing facility \nand  the  requirements  for  appropriate  phasing  and  grouping  of  subprojects  and  reforms.  An \nassessment of the feasibility of channeling loan funds through the newly established SFV will also be \nmade. The TA will assess whether the SFV is eligible to be used as a conduit to channel loan funds \nto the mega city in accordance with ADB policies on financial intermediation loans (FIL). In the event \nthat the SFV fails to meet the eligibility criteria, the TA will develop measures for the SFV to meet \nthese criteria in accordance with a time-bound action plan acceptable to ADB and the Government. \nThe TA will also assess the eligibility of the proposed subprojects for FIL in accordance with criteria \nstipulated and defined by ADB\u2019s FIL policy. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.250 million equivalent, comprising $737,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $513,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The foreign exchange costs \nand $263,000 equivalent in local currency, totaling $1 million, will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will procure that the government of Sindh (GOS) will \nprovide  $250,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  cost  of  remuneration  of  counterpart  staff,  office \naccommodation  and  facilities,  transportation  for  counterpart  staff,  and  workshop  facilities.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The Department of Finance (DOF) of the GOS will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the \nTA. With the ample capacity, a proper mandate, and a cadre of professional staff able to provide \ntechnical and policy guidance, DOF is considered suitable to execute the TA\u2014and especially to \nguide the design of the SFV. The EA will closely coordinate with the TA loan activities. A TA support \nunit will be established in the EA. The EA will provide administrative and technical support and \nlogistics for consultants. The TA support unit will have a fulltime director supported by qualified \nprofessional staff, including staff members seconded from the CDGK. A high-level TA steering \ncommittee comprising representatives of the federal government, relevant GOS departments, and \nCDGK will be formed. The TA steering committee will provide policy support, oversee TA progress, \nfacilitate  cooperation  among  agencies,  and  provide  inputs  into  the  TA  outputs  at  key  stages. \nEquipment provided under the TA will be turned over to the EA upon completion of the TA.   \n \n20.  The TA will be undertaken by a team of international and domestic consultants to be \nengaged  as  individuals  or  as  a  firm  in  accordance  with  the  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. In case \nof firms' engagement, quality-based selection will be used as the failure of the TA will significantly \nimpact on a large mega city population as well as the Government and ADB financing. About 50 \nperson-months of consulting services (25 international and 25 domestic) will be required. The team \nwill  comprise  international  experts  (person-months  are  in  parenthesis)  in  urban \ndevelopment/engineering/team leader (5), strategic infrastructure planning (3), urban governance (2), \neconomics (2), financial analysis/municipal finance (2), urban infrastructure finance and SFV (5), \nproject and corporate finance and private\u2013public partnership (3), and corporate structure, planning, \nand  management  of  SFVs  (3).  The  domestic  consultants  will  be  experts  in  urban  planning, \ninfrastructure  finance,  project  financing  and  SFV,  financial  and  project  economics,  corporate \nstructure and management, environment, water and sanitation, transport, social development and \nurban upgrading. Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 4. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months from February 2006 to October 2006. The \nconsultants will submit an inception report, including details on the approach, scope, and work \n ", "6   \nprogram, within 1 month. An interim report will be submitted within 4 months, containing (i) the \nfeasibility and preliminary design of the SFV; (ii) mega city medium-term infrastructure investment \nprogram, and a policy and institutional reform agenda; and (iii) proposals for the priority subprojects. \nA draft final report, to be submitted within 6 months of the TA commencement will comprise (i) the \ndetailed design of the SFV, including all documentation required to establish the SFV; (ii) analysis of \nthe feasibility of selected bankable subprojects; (iii) an assessment and proposal for channeling the \nensuing investment loan through the use of a multi-tranche finance facility; (iv) an analysis of the \nfeasibility of using the SFV as a conduit to channel ADB loan funds to the mega city; (v) necessary \nsafeguard frameworks and plans; and (vi) project costs, financing arrangements, and implementation \narrangements. ADB will hold tripartite meetings with the government and consultants at inception, \ninterim, and draft final stages. Workshops will also be held to discuss interim and draft final reports \nwith stakeholders. A final report will be submitted 1 month after the Government and ADB comment \non the draft final report.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Pakistan for preparing the Mega City Sustainable Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/ReportingMe and Risks  \nchanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \n\u2022 Improved quality of life for  \u2022 City environment improved  \u2022 Government of Pakistan, \n\u2022  Federal, provincial, \nurban residents, including  (percentage of city population  GOS, CDGK, and TMAs \nand city government \nthe poor, on a sustainable  with access to urban services  remain committed to \nbasis.  increased).a  statistics.  sustainable mega-city \n\u2022  Reports of bilateral \n  \u2022 Poverty incidence reduced  development.  \nand multilateral \n   (percentage of population in  \u2022 Project implemented \norganizations and \nkatchi abadis [squatters'  effectively. \nNGOs. \nvillages] with access to  Risk \nurban services increased).a  \u2022 Delay in project \n\u2022 City productivity increased  implementation. \n(city\u2019s contribution to the   \nnational gross domestic \nproduct increased).a \nOutcome      Assumption \n\u2022 An agreed-upon design  \u2022  Aide Memoire of the ADB  \u2022  ADB Mission\u2019s Aide  \u2022 A high-quality project \nof (i) a specialized  appraisal mission   Memoire.  preparatory TA final report, \nfinancing vehicle and (ii)  confirmed by the    providing good analysis and \na loan for the Mega City  Government in 2006.   proposals tailored to the \nSustainable Development  mega city, is prepared on \nProgram.   time. \n  Risk \n\u2022 Lack of consensus within \nthe Government and \nbetween the Government \nand ADB with respect to the \nmega-city reform agenda \nand the design and role of \nthe SFV. \nOutputs       \nPart A   \u2022 Draft final report containing    Assumptions \n\u2022 Feasibility assessment  feasibility assessment and  \u2022 ADB document  (cid:131) Qualified consultants are \nand design for the SFV,  design of SFV submitted to  registration  mobilized in a timely \nincluding (i) rationale,  the Government and ADB by  \u2022 ADB review missions  manner. \nmission, and objectives;  August 2006.

No  country poverty partnership agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \n \nThe Government of Pakistan has developed a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy for accelerating growth and reducing \npoverty. The strategy is based on six principles (i) broad-based participation of stakeholders, (ii) a focus on outcomes that can \nbe monitored and that benefit the poor, (iii) recognition of the multi-dimensional nature of poverty, (iv) flexible implementation \nin fiscal and institutional terms, (v) private\u2013public partnership; and (vi) emphasis on the millennium development goals. The \nstrategy rests on four pillars: (i) achieving high and broad-based economic growth while maintaining macroeconomic stability; \n(ii) improving governance, consolidating devolution, and ensuring social and economic justice; (iii) investing in human capital; \nand (iv) bringing the poor and backward regions into the mainstream of development, and making marked progress in \nreducing existing inequalities. The poverty reduction partnership agreement signed by the Government of Pakistan and ADB \nreflects the above goals and principles and makes a commitment to reducing poverty by broadening community participation \nand opportunities for the poor over the next 5 years. The technical assistance (TA) will prepare a mega-city infrastructure and \nservices project which will improve the quality of life and public health for all city residents, including the poor, on a sustainable \nbasis. Through its emphasis on reforms, it will contribute to the Government strategic pillars of good governance and \nenhanced devolution. The TA will also contribute to sustainable economic growth by designing a specialized financing vehicle \nthat will promote sustainable financing of mega-city development. \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nApproximately 50% of the 12.5 million population of Karachi metropolis live below the poverty line1. Another 8.5% are living \nabove the poverty line but are vulnerable to shocks. Incidence of poverty varies between 40% and 57% in 18 towns and \ncantonment areas within the metropolis. Evidence confirms the large disparity in poverty incidence between developed city \nareas (40%) and katchi abadis, or squatters' villages (89%). However, further analysis shows that the proportion of the \npopulation living below the poverty line is 40% in all cantonments, 44% in planned and business oriented areas, and 46% in \nmiddle class residential towns. The highest poverty incidences are reported in working class neighborhoods and katchi \nabadis-dominated towns. \n \nMore than 1,000 katchi abadis account for over 40% of the total population of Karachi. A poverty assessment conducted \nunder the small scale technical assistance2 indicates that overall 89% of the population in these settlements is living below the \npoverty line. Based on the per capita income levels and the quintile divisions set by the Government, 54% of these people are \nat chronic poverty levels, around 35% are transitory poor, and 11% are in the category of transitory vulnerable. The majority of \nkatchi abadis are excluded from social services and have to spend significant amounts of their incomes to purchase water that \ncontributes further impoverishment. It is therefore safe to assume that the entire population living in katchi abadis live below \nthe poverty line. The assessment reveals that urban poverty is characterized by (i) lack of permanent occupation; (ii) \ninsufficient and irregular income; (iii) limited access to education and health care; (iv) deficient basic infrastructure and \nservices such as sanitation and solid-waste collection and disposal; and (v) lack of secure tenure of ownership of productive \nassets. Conditions are unhygienic; water- and feces-borne diseases are highly prevalent, undermining health and income-\nearning opportunities. In most cases physical and social exclusion act together, resulting in a perpetual cycle of poverty \ncharacterized by poor access to basic infrastructure and services, poor health and living conditions, low productivity, and low \nincomes of the poor. The assessment indicates that the poor in these katchi abadis cite the lack of basic infrastructure and \nservices and low incomes as the most severe problems. The ensuing project will contribute to poverty reduction (i) indirectly, \nby creating an environment conducive to economic growth; and (ii) directly, by addressing the basic service needs of the poor \nliving in katchi abadis. The improvement of infrastructure and services will directly improve the living environment and health \nconditions for an estimated 40% of the city population. \nC.

Phase  one  will  be  dedicated  to  completion  of  the  feasibility  and  preparation  of  the \npreliminary design of the SFV. The tasks will include but not be limited to the following:   \n \n(i)  Complete and update the analysis of the economic, financial market, and all other related \nconditions and trends relevant to the feasibility of the specialized financing vehicle (SFV) \ncommenced in the technical assistance (TA) report.1  \n(ii)  Coordinate  with  the  Private  Participation  in  Infrastructure  Development  (PPID)  Project \ncurrently being processed by Asian Development Bank (ADB). Document that the two projects \nare consistent, complementary, and mutually reinforcing.  \n(iii)  Conduct a detailed analysis of the potential market for loan financing, TA, due diligence, loan \nsyndication, monitoring, and financing-coordination services to be provided by SFV, assessing \nthe quality of the likely borrowers and projects.  \n(iv)  Building on the SFV report, (a) conduct more detailed analysis of the strengths, weaknesses, \nkey issues and implications of the design features that are available to an SFV for Karachi \n(and Sindh); (b) assess each design feature in detail with reference to Karachi\u2019s conditions, \nnational and international best practices, trends and requirements identified in task (a); and (c) \nusing various indicators and criteria described in the TA report and  literature on specialized \nfinancial intermediaries, identify the design features that are most important to structuring an \nSFV  for  Karachi  and  performance  of  the  ensuing  loan  project.  Provide  comprehensive \nrationale for SFV, assessing \"with and without SFV\" situations.  \n(v)  In  assessing  the  features  and  preparing  the  preliminary  design  of  the  SFV,  specifically \nconsider the following factors: (a) whether SFV should be a for-profit or non-profit unit; (b) how \nSFV can best catalyze nongovernment and international financial institution resources and the \ntechnical expertise of commercial financial intermediaries and private sector in infrastructure \nfinancing; (c) possible strategic alliances/partnerships/equity stakes in SFV with one or more \ncommercial financial intermediaries; (d) ownership structures, including potential public and \nnongovernment shareholders of the SFV; (e) SFV\u2019s role in working with project sponsors to \nprepare bankable projects; (f) management structure, staffing, HR planning, and operating \nstructure;  (g)  the  long-term  business  strategy;  (h)  geographic,  sectoral  scope,  and  the \nfinancial resources and markets to be accessed by SFV\u2014including private financing using the \nPPID  instruments;  (i)  potential  products,  including  loans,  equity  investments,  credit \nenhancements,  conduit  products  (e.g.,  concessional  loans,  subsidies  from  government \nprograms,  free  or  low-cost  land  which  might  be  targeted  at  poor  neighborhoods);  (j) \ncontractual and monitoring and reporting relationships that need to be established between \nSFV and the Government. \n(vi)  Consider also the following factors in assessing the features and preliminary design of SFV: (a) \nin case there are too few bankable projects to make SFV viable, what the SFV should do and \nwhether it should spend resources assisting the CDGK in restructuring projects to make them \nbankable; (b) whether the SFV should play the role of funder or a facilitator of finance; (c) if \nthe SFV is a funder, whether it should set a percentage ceiling on what it will lend for each \nproject (e.g., 30%); this could stimulate the interest of local banks in project finance; and (d) \nwhether and at what stage SFV can borrow in the market, taking into account Pakistan's \ncheckered history with development finance institutions. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Phase Two: Completion of Detailed Design and Documentation to Establish SFV  \n \n2.  Phase two will focus on the detailed design and documentation needed to establish the SFV. \n \n(i)  Based on the suggested preliminary design, complete the analysis of the urban infrastructure \nmarket's demand for commercial loans, TA, monitoring, financial intermediation, financing \ncoordination,  syndication,  and  other  services  that  would  be  provided  by  SFV.  Demand \nanalysis should include a yearly breakdown of the loans and other transactions expected to be \nmade over a 10-year period, divided by infrastructure sector, major borrowers, and other \ncriteria. \n(ii)  Develop  a  marketing  plan  to  (a)  realize  potential  market  demand  and  make  potential \nborrowers and project entities aware of the technical and financial services available from the \nSFV;  and  (b)  build  awareness  of  the  need  for  commercial  operating  principles  in  urban \ninfrastructure utilities. \n(iii)  Estimate the initial capital injection needed to establish the start-up capital structure of the \nSFV; estimate the financial resources that need to be made available to the SFV through a \nfixed  time  period  (e.g.,  over  the  first  10  years);  financial  resources  could  come  from \ngovernments (e.g., seed money to support start-up), the ADB (through loan money, perhaps \nequity from the Private Sector Operations Department and its partial guarantee facility and \nother  international  financial  institutions  (IFIs),  and/or  domestic  and  international  capital \nmarkets (both loans and equity). \n(iv)  Identify, analyze, and place monetary values on the compensation costs (wages plus benefits) \nof the professional, technical, support, and other staff and skill requirements of the SFV; \nevaluate to the extent possible whether these personnel will be available to the SFV once it is \nestablished; and assess other administration costs likely to be incurred by the SFV. \n(v)  Estimate the interest rates, on-lending fees, TA, and other fees that should be imposed in \norder to make the SFV self-sustaining and (if appropriate) profitable to its shareholders; \nensure that the market and potential borrowers can accommodate (i.e., are prepared to pay \nfor) those fees and interest rates; make necessary adjustments to payrolls and other costs; \nand prepare a spreadsheet-based financial model for the SFV incorporating all of the above \nprojected SFV revenues and costs. Prepare sensitivity scenarios for the financial model based \non realistic scenarios. \n(vi)  Identify key risks and uncertainties (including risks associated with foreign exchange, credit, \nnon-performing loans, and politics) that could threaten the sustainability and profitability of the \nSFV, and develop strategies to address them. Assess the possibility of employing a phased \nstrategy to implement the SFV business plan, whereby less complex, less risky services and \n ", "14    Appendix 4 \n \nproducts  might  be  launched  earlier  than  complicated,  more  risky  services  and  products. \nPresent the Government with the findings at this stage and provide ADB with a progress \nreport. \n(vii)  Prepare  and  finalize  the  business  case  (detailing  the  vision,  mission,  rationale,  concept, \napproach, major benefits, beneficiaries, ownership, corporate and managerial structure, and \nlegal and taxation status and the licenses to be secured from the Government, business plan, \nand long-term strategy for SFV. The business case should also review the proposed role and \nresponsibilities of the SFV from the perspective of the city government functions (a) to ensure \nclear segregation of duties, (b) to reduce the likelihood of overlap, and (c) to ensure that \naccountability of local government to deliver services not obviated. The business plan should \ninclude a full set of financial projections.  \n(viii)  The business plan and long-term strategy should suggest a phased approach for launching \nthe SFV, e.g., (a) develop SFV capabilities and market credibility through on-lending of ADB \nand other IFI funds to urban infrastructure projects; (b) provide other financial products and \nforms of debt and in time equity financing; (c) in the long run, tap national and international \ncapital markets; (d) in the longer term, conduct innovative transactions, e.g., public\u2013private \npartnerships, fully private projects, or funding of commercially operating state enterprises.  \n(ix)  Prepare the human resource development (HRD) and capacity building strategy for SFV, with \ndetails  on  the  professional,  technical,  and  support  skills  needed  by  SFV,  its  recruitment \npolicies and strategies, training and other HRD measures, and wage and other compensation \npackages needed to recruit and retain qualified personnel at all levels of the organization. \nCapacity  building  should  include  building  understanding  of  (a)  the  requirements  and \nprocedures of ADB and other IFIs (financial, social, poverty, environmental, etc.); (b) special \nfinancing  requirements  of  urban  infrastructure  projects;  (c)  factors  required  to  prepare \ninfrastructure projects to meet bankable standards; (d) marketing skills to make SFV products \nand services attractive to local governments, utilities, and potential borrowers on commercial \nlending terms; and (e) post-transaction monitoring and evaluation requirements. \n(x)  Prepare a detailed operations manual for SFV management and staff (SFV shareholders and \ndirectors). The manual should be designed to guide the procedures of the SFV during its initial \nperiod of 1 or 2 years, and should be updated every 2 years. The manual should outline (a) \nthe vision, mission, and purpose of SFV; (b) what SFV does\u2014its financial products and \nservices, sources of funds (now and in the near future), investment financing operations, TA \nand client training, eligible recipients and sectors, eligible uses of funds, etc.; (c) how SFV \noperates  (including  marketing,  project  identification  and  pre-screening,  project  appraisal, \ncredit assessment methods, post-transaction monitoring and evaluation, other lending policies \nand procedures, public awareness, and project procurement, if relevant); (d) how SFV prices \nits financial products and services; (e) how it is managed and how decisions are made; (f) \nconflict of interest rules and a code of conduct for directors and staff; and (g) how the SFV \naddresses  the  social,  poverty,  environmental,  economic,  and  other  objectives  that  are \nimportant to ADB and other IFIs and bilateral donors\u2014and that are increasingly important to \nthe domestic and international investors that could provide debt and equity financing to the \nSFV. \n(xi)  The project selection system should include measures to ensure that selected projects are \nconsistent with the infrastructure subsector strategies, road maps, and master plans of CDGK. \n (xii)  Prepare with counterpart staff from both parties the draft memorandum of understanding \nbetween  SFV  and  the  government  agency  identified  for oversight  of  the  proposed  SFV, \nincluding: (a) the roles, responsibilities, and obligations of each party; and (b) SFV\u2019s objectives \nand functions, and the criteria and indicators to be used to measure objectives achievement \n(including feedback from clients, investors, and the general public).
