INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  supported  Tonga\u2019s  comprehensive  public \nenterprise reform (rationalization) process since 2002, when the country passed the Public \nEnterprises  Act.1  A  series  of  technical  assistance  (TA)2  projects  helped  the  Government \nstrengthen the corporate governance of public enterprises, establish a financial performance \nmonitoring  framework,  train  directors  and  senior  officials  on  requirements  of  the  Public \nEnterprises  Act,  and  develop  its  capacity  to  monitor  and  rationalize  the  public  enterprise \nportfolio.  \n \n2.  In  2006,  the  Prime  Minister  made  public  enterprise  reform  a  central  tenet  of  his \neconomic growth plan, and created the Ministry of Public Enterprises and Information (MPEI) as \na specialist public enterprise monitoring agency to accelerate the reform. The most recent \nphase (phase III) of the rationalization process, completed in late 2008, focused on five public \nenterprises, and executed the first privatization of a Tongan public enterprise with the sale of the \nGovernment\u2019s majority shareholding in Leiola duty free stores. Another enterprise has been \nliquidated through an asset sales process, and three additional enterprises are at various stages \nof the approved rationalization process. Drawing from the success and momentum created from \nthis process, the Government has reaffirmed its strong reform commitment and requested that \nADB provide further TA to finalize the ongoing transactions and to prepare rationalization plans \nfor most of the remaining public enterprises in the portfolio. \n \n3.  This TA3 directly supports implementation of the Government\u2019s Strategic Development \nPlan Eight 2006/07\u20132008/09 by promoting private sector-led growth through corporatization of \nselected government commercial  activities, privatization of selected public enterprises, and \nstrengthened corporate governance in the public enterprise sector. It is in line with ADB\u2019s  \n2007\u20132012 country partnership strategy for Tonga, particularly the focus areas of private sector \ndevelopment (PSD) and fiscal management.4 It is consistent with ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy.5 The \nTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  The TA is part of a new partnership between ADB and Tonga in support of private sector-\nled economic growth. ADB's 2008 private sector assessment6 for Tonga helped establish a \ncomprehensive program of PSD reforms, which are being implemented. The program includes \nthe rationalization of public enterprises, as supported under this TA, as well as outsourcing road \nmaintenance activities, strengthening the legal business environment, and enhancing access to \nfinance, with support from ADB's Pacific PSD initiative.7  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Tonga\u2019s public enterprise reform process has only just begun. Its public enterprise sector \nstill inhibits PSD and depresses economic growth. Many public enterprises compete against the \nprivate sector, and do so with the advantage of subsidized capital and\u2014in many cases\u2014\npreferred access to government contracts. This practice serves to crowd out the private sector, \nthereby reducing opportunities for private investment and innovation. The low productivity of \npublic enterprises also weakens the economy\u2019s overall performance. Public enterprises control \n14%\u201322%  of  total  fixed  assets  within  the  economy,  yet  contribute  just  over  6%  to  gross \ndomestic product (GDP).8 Each $1 invested in public enterprises contributes just $0.26 to GDP, \ncompared  to  $0.84  for  each  $1  invested  in  the  private  sector.  Tonga\u2019s  public  enterprises \ncurrently achieve an overall return on average equity of 3.9% (see Appendix 2). This is well \nbelow the 10% target return on equity set by the Government for the public enterprise portfolio, \nand far less than the rates of return expected in the private sector. \n \n6.  The difference between the opportunity costs of capital, which conservatively is set by \nthe  Government\u2019s  target  return,  and  the  returns  actually  achieved  by  public  enterprises \nrepresent a real loss of economic value, which compounds each year. The economic value \ndestroyed by the public enterprise portfolio in Tonga over FY2002\u2013FY2006 equals around half \nof the Government's budget spent on health and education for the same period. Rationalization \nof  public  enterprises  will  not  only  reduce  the  economic  cost  associated  with  these \nunderperforming assets but will also free up capital to invest in more productive sectors of the \neconomy, including the vital social sectors. \n \n7.  Creating more opportunities for private investment and reducing the economic strain \nrepresented  by  public  enterprises  will  require  (i)  an  accelerated  effort  to  rationalize  the \nremaining enterprises in the Government's portfolio, which may include the restructuring and \ndivestiture of activities that can be conducted more efficiently by the private sector; and (ii) \ncontinued  capacity  development  in  corporate  governance  to  strengthen  public  enterprise \ndirectors\u2019 ability to serve as effective stewards of their public enterprises, strategic and financial \nanalysis of public enterprises, and public\u2013private partnerships for MPEI9 and other government \nagencies.  \n \n8.  International experience suggests that the key to successful public enterprise reform is \nto infuse public enterprises with private sector discipline and competitive market pressures. \nLessons  learned  in  Tonga  and  comparable  countries  in  the  region  include:  (i)  political \ncommitment is vital to successful reform; (ii) continued financing of poorly performing public \nenterprises does not restore their profitability; (iii) the private sector has the capacity to invest in \npublic enterprises and to deliver community service obligations; and (iv) reform prescriptions \nshould be avoided, and innovation and flexibility should be emphasized in the reform response \nto enterprise-specific issues and situations. Reform options may involve measures such as \nprivatization,  public\u2013private  partnerships,  restructuring,  liquidation,  and  community  service \nobligations. \n \n9.  Political commitment to public enterprise reform is high in Tonga. The Government has \ndemonstrated its reform commitment through results achieved in the course of the reform \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009. Finding Balance: Making State-Owned Enterprises Work in Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga. Sydney \nand Manila. Figures are for 2005. \n9  MPEI  includes  14  staff  members,  including  the  director,  the  deputy  secretary,  five  financial  analysts,  and \nadministration and support personnel. An additional analyst is being recruited. As a relatively new government \nministry, MPEI is developing its capacity with the support of the TA and independently. \n ", "  3\nprocess, including a first privatization and several ongoing pre-privatization initiatives such as \nprivatization tenders, liquidations, and the progressive adoption of a new policy to phase out all \ngovernment ministers and public servants from public enterprise boards. The TA, as proposed \nby  the  Government,  will  cover  the  rationalization  of  a  relatively  large  number  of  public \nenterprises,  including  three  public  enterprises  currently  reformed  and  at  least  five  larger \ninfrastructure-related public enterprises. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The overall impact of the TA is increased private sector investment to fuel growth in \nTonga\u2019s economy. Reducing the size and breadth of the public enterprise sector will have a \ndirect impact on private investment, as opportunities for service delivery dominated by public \nenterprises will be opened up to the private sector, and a more level playing field established for \nprivate competitors of public enterprises. \n \n11.  The expected outcome is reduced fiscal exposure to public enterprises. This will be \nachieved through rationalization of the public enterprise portfolio, creating opportunities for \nprivate ownership of public enterprises and for private involvement in the operation of public \nenterprises through contracting out and public\u2013private partnerships. The rationalization of the \npublic  enterprise  portfolio  is  also  expected  to  free  up  cash  through  divestment  of  public \nenterprises or sale of assets and by improving the performance of those enterprises remaining \nunder public ownership. Moreover, the TA will strengthen the legal and governance framework \nof  Tonga\u2019s  public  enterprise  sector  and  will  build  capacity  within  MPEI  to  monitor  the \nGovernment's investments in public enterprises.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will assist the Government with the rationalization of selected public enterprises \nthat have been identified by MPEI. Specifically, the TA will help (i) complete the ongoing \nrationalization strategy approved by the Government for three public enterprises; (ii) determine \nthe  rationalization  strategy  for  at  least  five  additional  public  enterprises;  (iii)  prepare  a \nrationalization plan for at least five public enterprises; (iv) provide technical, financial, and \nregulatory advice for the implementation of the approved strategy and implementation plan for \nat least five public enterprises; (v) provide technical support for the due diligence process and \nthe valuation process in the case of privatization or asset sale; (vi) develop MPEI capacity \nthrough on-the-job training; (vii) develop capacity of MPEI and public enterprise boards and \nmanagement through training in governance and financial analysis; and (viii) develop a director \nevaluation process.  \n \n13.  Based in Tonga for most of the TA duration, a small team of national and international \nexperts will lead the rationalization process and develop capacity for MPEI staff in technical, \nmanagement, and regulatory areas as well as for public enterprise boards and management in \ncorporate governance and financial analysis. While it is not anticipated that the public enterprise \nreform agenda will be completed under this TA, the finalization of several rationalizations is \nexpected. In some cases, the Government may determine, in consultation with TA experts and \nADB, that progress cannot be made for reasons beyond the control of the TA. Progress and \nissues will be closely monitored. \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $625,000. Of this, $500,000 will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  (TA  Special  Fund  IV).  The \nGovernment will finance the equivalent of $125,000 in kind through the provision of counterpart \nstaff,  office  accommodations,  and  local  communication.  Details  of  the  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MPEI will be the Executing Agency for the TA and ensure that TA activities are closely \ncoordinated with central agencies such as the Ministry of Finance and relevant sector ministries, \nas well as the public enterprises.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 15 months, from May 2009 to July 2010. A \nsmall team of international experts will be engaged on an individual basis, including a public \nenterprise reform expert (team leader) and a financial analyst. The international team will be \nsupported by a local legal expert. The consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA will require about 19 person-months of consulting services, comprising about 16 person-\nmonths of international and about 5 person-months of national consultants, to carry out the \nactivities as defined in the terms of reference (Appendix 4). The experts will be supplemented \nby ADB's regional TA resources, including the Pacific PSD Initiative, as required to intensify \nreform  activities.  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  line  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.10 \n \n17.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons learned, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (by e-mail) \nbrief monthly progress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. \nTeam members will produce inputs (reports) on their respective activities for the team leader's \nprogress and final reports. The team leader's final report will be submitted in draft form at least 5 \nweeks prior to the end of the assignment, and the final report within 2 weeks of receipt of \ncomments by the Government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tonga for Reforming Public Enterprises, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.
