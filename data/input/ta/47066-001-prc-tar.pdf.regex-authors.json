Inland  waterway  transport  (IWT)  is  an  efficient,  cost-effective,  and  environmentally \nfriendly way to move bulk commodities over long distances. Efficient use of waterways to \ntransport cargo can reduce transport cost, congestion on roads and railways, energy usage for \ntransport, and vehicle emissions including greenhouse gases. IWT can also be developed in \nways that bring other benefits, such as generation of hydroelectric power. The Sustainable \nTransport Initiative Operational Plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) points to IWT as a \nkey opportunity to promote safe and low-carbon transport that can support environmentally \nsustainable and inclusive growth. 1 ADB plans to scale up its technical assistance (TA) and \nlending activities in IWT and in 2012 approved its first IWT loan to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) for the Hunan Xiangjiang Inland Waterway Transport Project.2 A second IWT \nproject, the Anhui Intermodal Sustainable Transport Development Project is being proposed for \nBoard consideration in 2014. \n \n2.  The Government of the People's Republic of China has asked ADB for policy and \nadvisory TA to help prepare a strategy to further develop IWT in Chongqing by enabling efficient \nmultimodal connections between railway, road, and the waterways; develop an investment \nprogram and policies to better balance supply and demand for freight transport; and develop \nstrategies and policies to maximize capacity of shipping along the Yangtze River and navigable \ntributaries. Initial discussions regarding the TA proposal were held during the ADB Sustainable \nInland Waterway Transport International Workshop on 11\u201312 September 2012 in Chongqing. \nThis TA report is based on the understandings reached between the government and the TA \nfact-finding mission fielded on 24\u201326 March 2013. The report reflects agreements reached on \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, financing, and terms of \nreference  for  consulting  services  for  the  TA.3 The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Chongqing  is  a  major  municipality  in  the  southwestern  part  of  the  PRC  near  the \nconfluence of the Jialing and the Yangtze rivers, making it one of the country\u2019s most important \ninland ports. The Yangtze River connects the major cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan to \nChongqing.  In  2011,  the  State  Council  of  the  PRC  endorsed  a  plan  to  accelerate  the \ndevelopment of the Yangtze River and other inland waterways within 10 years. As part of the \neffort, the improvement of the Chongqing Yangtze River shipping center has been adopted as a \nnational strategy. The Chongqing municipal government is promoting development of the upper \nreaches of the Yangtze River shipping center with the goal of making Chongqing the main \nfreight transport and logistics hub for the western part of the PRC. \n \n4.  Before the construction of the Three Gorges Dam, the government gave less attention to \nthe development of inland waterways and focused more resources on improving highways and \nrailways. Public investment in IWT fell below what was needed to maintain and renew the IWT \ninfrastructure. Despite recent increases in IWT investment, many inland ports serving IWT are \nold and lack specialized berths and modern handling equipment. Several port handling facilities \nexist throughout Chongqing, including many impromptu riverbank sites. The contribution of IWT \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Hunan Xiangjiang Inland Waterway Transport Project. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 August 2013. \n ", "2  \nto the overall transport system has also been constrained by weak institutional coordination \nbetween the local, regional, and national governments. \n \n5.  The Yangtze River can provide a low-cost, low-emission, and efficient freight route \nlinking the vast and relatively poor interior of the western PRC to the economically advanced \ncoastal regions. The development of the Three Gorges Dam and the completion of the ship \nlocks bypassing the dam in 2003 have created a major new high-capacity transport corridor \nbetween Chongqing and the eastern PRC and international markets. Ocean-going vessels are \nnow capable of navigating the 2,400 kilometers between Shanghai and Chongqing. In addition, \nrapid development of railways and roadways continues into the western PRC, which will better \nconnect the western provinces to Chongqing and then to the central and eastern PRC via the \nYangtze River.  \n \n6.  After the introduction of ship locks, the total annual waterway capacity through the Three \nGorges area increased from 18 million tons to 100 million tons. The construction of the Three \nGorges Dam was estimated to reduce shipping costs by 35%\u201337%. 4 Between 2003 and 2011, \nfreight volume through the Three Gorges Dam grew by 17% per year and reached the stated \ncapacity of the Three Gorges ship locks in 2011. Over the same period waterway freight ton-\nkilometers in Chongqing municipality grew over 30% per year and by 2011,5 waterway port \nthroughput in Chongqing exceeded 100 million tons, making it one of the largest inland ports in \nthe PRC.6 Coal, raw minerals, and containerized goods provide the majority of traffic plying this \nsection of the river. \n \n7.  The capacity bottleneck at the ship locks serving the Three Gorges Dam now limits the \npotential development of the western PRC, increasing the transport cost for all goods. Various \nmeasures are under way to expand the capacity through the Three Gorges Dam. First, a ship lift \nis  under  construction  and  expected  to  open  by  2015.  Second,  short portage railways  are \nproposed on both sides of the dam to bypass the ship locks. Lastly, the national government, \nwith the support of Chongqing, plans to add another ship channel and ship lock to the Three \nGorges Dam to increase throughput. Additional capacity can be derived from optimizing and \nstandardizing ship types so that the available capacity is used more efficiently. With these \nefforts, the demand for IWT is expected to continue its rapid growth, fueling further industrial \ndevelopment, international trade, and better market access for the less developed regions in the \nwestern PRC. \n \n8.  Rapid growth in freight throughput notwithstanding, the market for passenger travel on \nthe Yangtze River has changed markedly since the late 1990s. There are many passenger \nships that originate or terminate at Chongqing, cruising downstream along the Yangtze River to \nYichang, Wuhan, Nanjing, or Shanghai. In the past, this provided virtually the only transportation \noption along the river. However, improved railways, expressways, and aviation services have \ncaptured much of the passenger traffic; thus most of the river ferry traffic now consists of leisure \ncruises for tourists rather than serving transportation needs. Many ships formerly used for ferry \nservice are ill-suited to serve the current passenger market.  \n \n9.  There are also imbalances in the supply and demand for certain types of freight-handling \nfacilities. The government has supported the development of several large IWT container-\nhandling ports that are operating far below capacity. The Chongqing Shipping Exchange has \n                                                \n4  R. Wang. 2004. Fighting the Floods.

However, \nonly about 30% of the Chongqing IWT market makes use of the exchange. Detailed analyses of \nfreight and logistics market demand, capacity and multimodal connections, potential economic \nand financial returns, and competitiveness of alternative modes are needed to develop plans, \npolicies, and investment project proposals that respond to market opportunities and rectify \nsector imbalances. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The TA will help the government devise a sector restructuring and development strategy \nfor IWT and multimodal freight transportation in Chongqing municipality. It will define investment \nopportunities and promote rebalancing of supply and demand where needed. The strategy will \nbe based on a detailed and comprehensive assessment of the freight and logistics market in \nChongqing to ensure that the investment program is economically and financially viable and \npromotes private sector participation. The TA will outline opportunities for future ADB-financed \nprojects related to IWT and multimodal logistics.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be the development of Chongqing as the IWT freight hub for \nthe western PRC. The outcome will be the adoption of a sector development strategy and sound \ninvestment program for IWT and multimodal logistics in Chongqing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will develop a sector development and restructuring plan to (i) promote IWT \nreforms,  (ii)  promote  multimodal  integration,  (iii) help  the  government  maximize  capacity \nutilization of IWT infrastructure by promoting standardization of the shipping fleet operating in \nthe upper Yangtze, and (iv) promote private sector participation and the development of e-\ncommerce in IWT. \n \n13.  The TA will produce the following outputs: \n(i)  Freight market assessment for Chongqing. The TA will provide a detailed \nreview of regional freight market demand by industry and transport mode; assess \nfreight capacity by cargo type and mode, and determine capacity constraints; \ndevelop indicators of capacity utilization, throughput, mode share by cargo type \nand region; and suggest appropriate levels and targets based on economic and \nfinancial viability. \n(ii)  Infrastructure development and management plan for inland waterways. \nThe TA will assess the investments targeted under the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015  and  assist  the  government  in  adjusting  and  revising  the  IWT \ninvestment program; provide inputs to support the development of the Thirteenth \nFive-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020 based on projected economic and financial returns; \nidentify  missing  links,  key  bottlenecks,  and  potential  multimodal  connections \nbetween roads, railways, and waterways that would facilitate further development \nof  IWT  in  the  upper  Yangtze  River;  link  proposed  investments  to  potential \nfinancing  options,  including  proposed  IWT  or  port  projects  that  would  be \nappropriate  for  ADB  financing;  and  evaluate  the  management  structure  for \nexisting and future investments, such as the potential for private sector financing \nand management, and public\u2013private partnerships.  \n ", "4  \n(iii)  Ship  fleet  standards,  equipment,  and  organizational  review. The TA will \nreview the prevailing national cargo ship standards and recommend options for \nstandardizing specifications for cargo ships operating in the Upper Yangtze to \noptimize capacity utilization of the IWT system; provide input to the Ministry of \nTransport on the regulation of standards for ships operating through the Three \nGorges ship locks; develop a strategy for reforming the inland water transport \nmarket and ship fleet along the upper Yangtze River; recommend legal and \nregulatory actions needed to promote private sector participation in IWT; and \nrecommend ways to minimize environmental impacts with respect to ships and \nother equipment. \n(iv)  Recommendations  for  further  development  of  the  Chongqing  Shipping \nExchange. The TA will assess the functions and efficiency of the exchange \ncenter;  evaluate  the  level  of  service  integration  for  settlement,  financing, \ninsurance,  and  customs  processing,  and  compare  it  with  best  international \npractices;  conduct  performance  and  cost  benchmarking  against  best-practice \ninternational exchanges to single out areas that need improvement; and make \nrecommendations to integrate and promote the use of information technology \nand e-commerce platforms in the exchange. \n(v)  Assessment of future research needs. The TA will prepare short policy notes \non (a) safety and security needs, (b) energy saving and environmental protection, \nand (c)  human  resource  development  in  IWT. The  policy  notes  will  seek to \npresent the key issues under each topic, develop a plan for further research on \ninnovation  in  the  sector,  and  institutional  capacity  building  that  could  be \nimplemented under a future ADB-financed loan or TA project. \n \n14.  The TA activities will include stakeholder workshops to promote consensus on the policy \nproposals,  a  seminar  to  present  the  results  to  key  decision  makers,  and  a  proposed \nimplementation strategy for all recommendations. \n \n15.  The TA assumes that Chongqing municipality is motivated and capable of reforming \ninland waterway institutions and is willing to allow the private sector to play an increasing role in \nfreight transport and logistics in Chongqing. The main risk to the TA is that the proposed \ncapacity  expansion  of  the  Three  Gorges  ship  locks  fails  to  be  implemented,  which  could \nconstrain further development of IWT in Chongqing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  government  will  provide \ncounterpart  professional  and  support  staff;  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  utilities  and \ntelecommunication access; materials, maps, available data, and documents required by the TA; \nand will cover the cost of utilities (not including telephone) for the consultants. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Chongqing Communications Committee (CCC) will be the executing agency for the \nTA and will be responsible for guiding and supervising the TA activities and for coordinating with \nrelevant government agencies and organizations. An expert panel of local and national experts \non IWT, agreeable to ADB, will be nominated by the CCC to provide peer review and guidance \nto the consultant team. Up to three workshops will be held in Chongqing to review the results of \n ", "  5\nthe TA and receive feedback from the expert panel. The TA consultants will organize and \nimplement an international study tour to learn about international best practices in inland port \ndevelopment, management, and e-commerce. \n \n18.  A team from a national consulting firm, including at least one international consultant, will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected through the fixed budget \nselection method. The TA will require an estimated 25 person-months of national and about \n4 person-months of international consulting services to carry out the assignment. Procurement \nwill  follow  the  ADB  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and \nequipment will be turned over to the CCC upon completion of TA activities. TA proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over 14 months from 15 February \n2014 to 15 April 2015. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The TA will produce three reports and three policy notes during implementation. Each \nreport will be delivered in English and Chinese. The initial report will detail the data collection \nand  survey  results,  and  the  analysis  of  freight  market  demand  in  Chongqing.  The  TA \nconsultants will then prepare the draft policy notes and the interim report containing the initial \ninfrastructure  development  and  management  plan,  the  ship  fleet  recommendations  and \norganizational review, and the recommendations for the Chongqing Shipping Exchange. After \nreview  by  the  expert  panel,  ADB,  and the  executing  agency, the  draft final  report  will  be \nprepared and will combine the project outputs into a single volume. After further review, the final \nreport will be prepared and submitted to ADB and the executing agency. \n \n20.  Outputs of the TA will be disseminated at a high-level seminar for key stakeholders in \nChongqing. The final report is expected to be prepared and distributed as a joint publication of \nADB and the government for wider distribution within the PRC, and to provide lessons for ADB\u2019s \nother developing member countries. The government will confirm the achievement of the project \noutcome within 1 year of TA closing. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Strategy  for  Restructuring  Inland \nWaterway Transport and Multimodal Logistics in Chongqing, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nChongqing is  IWT shipping volumes  Chongqing Statistical  Continued economic \ndeveloped as the IWT  continue to increase by 8%  Yearbook  growth in the region \nfreight hub for the  per year through 2020     \nwestern PRC  Risk \n  The proposed capacity \nexpansion of the Three \nGorges ship locks fails \nto be implemented, \nwhich constrains further \ndevelopment of IWT in \nChongqing \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nSector development  Sector strategy and  Chongqing municipal  Local government \nstrategy and  investment program  government  departments are willing \ninvestment program  accepted by the  to cooperate and \nfor IWT and  government by 2016  incorporate best \nmultimodal logistics is  practices and \nadopted in  international experience \nChongqing   into policy formulation \n   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Background \n1.  The government has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  prepare  a  strategy  for  restructuring  inland  waterway  transport  (IWT)  and \nmultimodal  logistics  in  Chongqing.  The  research  will  be  based  on  an  analysis  of  freight \nmultimodal infrastructure supply and market demand to prepare a sector development strategy \nfocusing on IWT and intermodal connectivity. IWT sector development plans will be based on \nthe  assessment  of  economic  and  financial  returns  and  seek  to  promote  private  sector \nparticipation  where  appropriate.  The  research  will  assist  the  government  in  promoting \nChongqing as a shipping center of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River; develop an efficient, \nsafe, green, and modern inland waterway system; and apply international best practices to \nsupport sector reform and development. \n \nB.  Technical Assistance Outputs \n2.  The terms of reference (TOR) are output-based which will not dictate the specific inputs \nneeded to produce the required outputs. The team leader and deputy team leader will be \nresponsible for assigning experts to each task to produce the TA outputs as effectively and \nefficiently as possible. Each output will be peer reviewed by an expert panel, the Executing \nAgency, and ADB before formal acceptance. The tasks and TA outputs are described below: \n \n3.
