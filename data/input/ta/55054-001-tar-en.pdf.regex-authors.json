The  proposed  Sustainable  Urban  Development  and  Service  Delivery  Program  will \nenhance support to urban development in India by accelerating and implementing policy actions \nand urban reforms through mainstreaming performance-linked funding for urban service delivery. \nThe proposed policy support aims to achieve universal and equitable access to urban services, \nwhich is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 and its operational \npriorities (OPs) of addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1); accelerating \nprogress  in  gender  equality  (OP2);  tackling  climate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3); making cities more livable (OP4); \nand strengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP6).1 The program is also aligned with \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India, 2018\u20132022, which envisages inclusive urbanization \nthrough policy advice and alignment with the government\u2019s national programs.2 \n \n2.  The Government of India requested financial support from ADB for urban national flagship \nprograms being implemented by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA), and ADB \nhas proposed a policy-based loan (PBL) from its ordinary capital resources (OCR) using a \nprogrammatic approach.3 The PBL has two subprograms of $350 million each to support policy \nactions in a sequential manner, ensuring that reforms are undertaken coherently both at the \nnational and state levels within the PBL period (2021\u20132023). The modality is designed to support \nthe implementation of policy actions that are crucial for structural reforms in the urban sector, with \nlinkages to service delivery outcomes and local revenue improvements. Subprogram 1 will \nsupport policy reform actions under the newly launched (October 2021) national flagship program, \nthe Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT) 2.0, by MOHUA; and \nrecommendations of the 15th Finance Commission for revenue transfers to state agencies. \nSubprogram 2 will support the implementation of these reforms in the states and urban local \nbodies (ULBs). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Urbanization in India. India\u2019s urban population in 2020 was 460 million, the second \nlargest in the world.4 The urban population is expected to grow by 2.01% per year over the next \n3 decades and is projected to reach 876 million by 2050.5 Although no systematic data for urban \ngross domestic product (GDP) are available, estimates of the urban share of GDP are 58%\u201370%.6 \nThe urban economy has grown because of growth in the services sector, which is estimated to \naccount for more than 70% of the urban output.

Urban sector challenges. Urban residents lack access to basic services, resulting in poor \nurban service delivery and environmental sustainability. Only 56.9% of the urban households \nhave piped water supply and only 53.5% are connected to an underground drainage system. The \nremainder dispose of their wastewater in covered surface drains (16.2%) or in an unsafe manner \n(27.8%).9 Wastewater treatment capacity is at 37% and untreated sewage is dumped into water \nbodies, polluting the environment. About 37.4% of urban households do not own a house and 17% \nof the urban population live in slums (2011). Women are worst affected by the unavailability or \npoor quality of the water, sanitation, and housing\u2014creating unhealthy conditions and depriving \nthem from income-generating activities. Of the world\u2019s 50 most polluted cities in terms of air quality, \n25 are in India.10 India\u2019s rapid urbanization is generating social and economic gains at the \nexpense of risking environmental sustainability and public health. Unplanned urbanization has \nalso exposed many people to increasing climate and disaster risks.  \n \n5.  Institutional framework of the urban sector. The Government of India\u2019s first guiding \nframework for urban governance reforms started with the 74th constitutional amendment of 1992, \nwhich provided a constitutional status to urban local governments as the third tier of governance. \nUrban planning and development are the responsibility of states, and various development \nauthorities undertake planning and development for cities and urban regions under the town \nplanning  acts  of  respective  states.  ULBs  implement  the  development  plans  and  urban \ndevelopment strategies that are approved by the state governments. ULBs are also responsible \nfor providing urban services (e.g., water, sanitation, and solid waste management) from their \nrevenue sources.11 \n \n6.  The Government of India does not have jurisdiction over local governments or most of the \nmatters related to urban areas. However, it has shaped the urban reform agenda and governance \npractices for promoting the economic development, investments, and competitiveness of cities. \nThe government has consistently provided discretionary financial support through fiscal transfers \nto states and ULBs and through its national flagship programs. It has also encouraged states to \nincrease their commitment to the urban sector. \n7.  Urban finance. Financial support from the national and state governments increased from \n0.35% of GDP in 2010\u20132011 to 0.45% of GDP in 2017\u20132018 because of increasing attention to \nand grant support for investments in urban infrastructure. While fiscal transfers through grants \nhave increased, these have not resulted in improvements to local revenue generation, and ULBs\u2019 \ndependence on fiscal transfers has increased.  The overall size of the municipal finance system \nis about 1.00% of GDP, of which ULBs\u2019 own-source revenues comprise about 0.55% of GDP, \nshowing ULBs\u2019 high dependence on government support. Tremendous scope exists to enhance \nthe own-source revenues of ULBs through reform measures such as enhancing property tax, as \n \n7  Government of India, MOHUA. 2021. Ease of Living Index 2020.

Government\u2019s policy direction. Urbanization in India is an important determinant of \nnational economic growth and poverty reduction. To address the country\u2019s urban challenges, the \ngovernment launched AMRUT 2.0, one of the key national missions focused on universal delivery \nof basic services. AMRUT 2.0 aims to provide support for (i) 100% water supply to all households \nvia  taps,  (ii)  100%  wastewater  management,  and  (iii)  100%  sanitation  and  solid  waste \nmanagement.  The  mission  also  promotes  wastewater  recycling  and  reuse  and  waterbody \nconservation. While the government\u2019s commitment to provide financial support to the urban sector \ncontinues, the approach to funding is undergoing a transition. The government is shifting its \nfunding approach from input-based to outcome-based, focusing on universal delivery of basic \nurban services. AMRUT 2.0 is also linking its incentive grants with key urban reforms that include \nimproving water resources management, local revenue mobilization, promoting public\u2013private \npartnerships, and wastewater reuse and value capture financing. \n \n9.  The proposed program, through the technical assistance (TA), will provide two tiers of \nsupport. The first tier is support to MOHUA for (i) developing various guidelines and establishing \nmonitoring mechanisms for the implementation of AMRUT 2.0; (ii) capturing lessons from the \nimplementation of AMRUT 2.0; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the AMRUT 2.0 program \nmanagement unit. The second tier of the support is to facilitate the actual implementation of the \nintended reforms under AMRUT 2.0 in states and ULBs. The TA will work with selected states \nand  ULBs  in  preparing  investment  plans  required  under  AMRUT  2.0  and  providing \nrecommendations on safeguards assessment and monitoring. The expectation is that the plans \nand projects prepared under the TA support will serve as models to be replicated by other states \nand ULBs. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.
