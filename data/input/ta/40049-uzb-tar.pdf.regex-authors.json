INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Uzbekistan has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to improve rural basic education services and prepare a loan project. A \nloan of $30 million from the Asian Development Fund is included in the project pipeline for 2007 \nto address priority needs in rural areas. An ADB fact-finding mission visited Uzbekistan from 23 \nJune to 8 July 2006 to review the country\u2019s priority needs and to reach an understanding with the \nGovernment on the impact, outcomes, outputs, and implementation and financing arrangements \nfor the project preparatory TA.1 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Socioeconomic Conditions. In 2005, the estimated population was 26 million, with a \ngrowth rate of about 1.9%. About 47% is under 20 years of age, and about 63% lives in rural and \nremote areas. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of 4.8% since 1996, with gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growing by 7.0% in 2005. Agriculture accounts for about 25% of GDP, \nwith cotton as the main agricultural export commodity. Industry contributes 20.7%, trade 9.2%, \ntransport and communications 11.3%, construction 4.9%, and other sectors including services \nabout 28.9%.2 Economic growth, however, has not reduced poverty. Poverty incidence remained \nat around 26% from 2000 to 2003, and rural poverty is deeply entrenched. About 70% of the poor \nlive in rural areas. Their lack of knowledge and skills limits formal and informal job opportunities \nand is a major cause of poverty. \n \n3.  Education System. The Government is determined to make the education system more \nresponsive and relevant to the requirements of a market economy.3 The system consists of \npreschool education (ages 3\u20136), compulsory primary and secondary education (grades 1\u20139), \noptional senior secondary education (grades 10 and 11), vocational and professional education (3 \nyears), and higher education (4 years). By 2010, the 11-year basic education system will be \nreplaced  by  a  mandatory  12-year  system,  which  will  provide  3  years  of  senior  secondary \neducation in either academic lyceums or technical and vocational schools. In 2005, a total of \n9,748 basic education schools had 451,567 teachers. About 82% of the schools were in rural \nareas;  22%  were  in  remote  rural  areas.  About  6.0  million  students  were  enrolled  in  basic \neducation: 2.3 million in grades 1\u20134, 3.2 million in grades 5\u20139, and 0.5 million in grades 10\u201311. \nThe net enrolment rate in grades 1\u20139 was 98%, with no significant gender differentials.4  \n \n4.  The delivery of quality education in rural areas is constrained by the poor school facilities. \nBuildings and equipment have deteriorated in past decades because of inadequate maintenance \nand scarce resources for rehabilitation. The Soviet-era construction standards used to build many \nrural schools were inefficient in the use of materials and energy, and structural capacity. Roofs, \nflooring, insulation, heating, and sanitation systems are particularly poor. The quality of learning \ndepends on the quality of instruction, which is often impaired by the poor teaching environment in \nrural schools. Insufficient and outdated teaching equipment for science classes and lack of basic \nteaching  aids  and  learning  materials  are  a  serious  constraint  on  applying  modern  teaching \nmethodologies. In 1998, the Government changed the curriculum from Cyrillic script to Latin \nscript. However, the reading materials that are needed to build up literacy skills of students in \nearly grades are insufficient, particularly in rural and remote schools. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 February 2006. \n2  Information provided by the Ministry of Finance. \n3  The Constitution of Uzbekistan guarantees free basic education to all citizens. \n4  Information provided by the Ministry of Public Education. ", "2   \n \n5.  The teaching techniques and subject knowledge of many teachers in rural schools are \noutdated and need to be upgraded. Few teachers employ student-centered learning approaches \nthat foster higher-order thinking and independent learning skills, which are crucial for lifelong \nlearning and adapting to changing labor market demands. The current in-service training program \nfor  teachers  in  rural  schools  is  considered  to  be  (i)  too  inflexible  to  adjust  to  changing \nrequirements of a modern education system; (ii) too centralized, making it difficult for teachers \nfrom remote schools to participate, particularly female teachers5 who have families to look after; \nand (iii) too infrequent to update the knowledge and teaching techniques of teachers.  \n \n6.  Surveys revealed clear disparities between urban and rural schools in the quality of school \nfacilities; allotment of teachers; and allocation and quality of materials, teaching equipment, and \nfurniture. Urban schools are better equipped in almost every aspect, followed by rural schools \nthat are close to the raion and oblast centers. Rural schools that are remote from raion and oblast \ncenters are the most disadvantaged. \n \n7.  In 2004, the Government launched the National Program for Basic Education 2004\u20132009, \nwhich  aims  to  strengthen  basic  education  to  meet  international  standards  and  to  remove \ndisparities between rural and urban schools, thereby creating equal opportunities for all students. \nUnder  the  program,  new  schools  are  being  constructed  and  existing  schools  are  being \nrehabilitated  and  repaired.  The  investment  costs  of  the  program,  which  are  estimated  at  \n$1.2 billion, will be financed by a combination of 75% budget financing, 20% foreign investment \nfinancing, and 5% local donor contributions. Included in the major investments are significant \nsalary increases for teachers and school principals, which should improve the reputation of the \nprofession and entice qualified university graduates to become teachers. Although under the \nprogram many schools have been successfully rehabilitated, capacities to comprehensively meet \nall school rehabilitation needs are limited, particularly to repair flooring and sanitation systems \nand to provide much-needed new classroom furniture, laboratory equipment, and basic teaching \naids to rural schools. Only new schools will be fully equipped; other schools covered by the \nprogram will receive only some new furniture, science equipment, teaching aids, and reading \nmaterials.  \n \n8.  Uzbekistan\u2019s expenditure on education in real terms is one of the highest among transition \ncountries, increasing every year since 2000, and reaching 8.8% of GDP in 2005. The amount \nspent on basic education is the highest among the education subsectors, at 50.3% of the total \neducation expenditure, with senior secondary education at 31.6%, preschool at 12.7%, and \nhigher education at 5.4%. The responsibility of financing education has shifted from the central \nGovernment to the oblasts and raions. In 2005, 65% of the national education budget was \nfinanced by raions, 22% by oblasts, and 13% by the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE). \nHowever, consultations at rural schools revealed that budget provisions are insufficient to cover \nall operation and maintenance expenditures; hence, schools rely on community support. Parents \nassist teachers with annual maintenance and minor repairs, and provide financial and in-kind \nsupport to schools. Companies, farmers, and community groups sponsor school operations and \ncontribute building materials and funds to rehabilitate school facilities that are not covered by the \nbudget. Other schools run small income-generating activities organized by teachers, students, \nand community members. The level of community participation and entrepreneurship depends \nlargely on the commitment and motivation of school principals and teachers. \n \n                                                 \n5  About 66% of basic education teachers are female (State Statistics Committee, 2005). \n ", "  3\n9.  ADB Assistance in the Education Sector.  ADB is the main development partner in the \neducation sector. It has supported the Government\u2019s efforts to strengthen the education system \nsince 1996.  Overall, the performance of the education sector has steadily improved over time, \nindicating that ADB\u2019s assistance is broadly aligned with the Government\u2019s reform agenda.  ADB\u2019s \nsector strategy in education has focused on (i) supporting efforts to improve quality, relevance, \nand access to basic education; and (ii) enhancing national capacity to manage sector reforms. \nADB  is  implementing  three  loan  projects  and  one  program  loan  in  basic  education:  (i)  the \nEducation Sector Development Program and Project, (ii) the Second Textbook Development \nProject, and (iii) the Information and Communication Technology in Basic Education Project. ADB \nis also providing assistance through two TA projects financed by grant funds.6 Through its loans \nand TA program, ADB is promoting a more systematic, coordinated, and participatory approach \nto reform.  \n \n10.  With the assistance of ADB and other development partners,7 strategies to strengthen the \nprofessional development of teachers have been prepared, curriculum modules revised, teaching \nmaterials and new textbooks produced, and school facilities improved. However, because of a \nlack of Government\u2019s capacity and the targeted nature of some pilot measures, most rural and \nremote schools have not benefited from them. Building on these achievements and lessons, and \nworking in line with the Government\u2019s policy to remove disparities between rural and urban \nschools, the project will complement ongoing activities and expand successful programs to rural \nand remote areas. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The outcome of the TA will be a project design suitable for ADB financing that will improve \nthe quality of rural basic education and eradicate disparities between urban and rural schools. \nThe main outputs will be (i) recommendations and investment options to improve the teaching \nand  learning  environment  in  rural  schools,  (ii)  draft  strategies  to  further  strengthen  the \nprofessional development of teachers and principals in rural schools, and (iii) draft strategies to \nstrengthen community participation. Based on the results and recommendations of existing sector \nsurveys and analyses, the TA will prepare a comprehensive sector study, including an analysis of \neducation financing and prioritized strategies for future investment needs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will use a participatory approach to build consensus among key government and \nnongovernment stakeholders and development partners. Participatory national, oblast, and raion \nworkshops  will  be  held  to  ensure  close  cooperation  and  active  involvement  of  government \nstakeholders,  school  managements  and  school  boards,  communities,  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) in the TA. The TA will conduct a social and poverty impact analysis and \nrecommend ways to enhance access for disadvantaged groups.

These arrangements will ensure close links with ongoing projects, \nparticularly in teacher training and community participation. \n \n13.  Improving the Teaching and Learning Environment in Rural Schools. As requested \nby the Government, the project design will improve the teaching and learning environment in rural \nschools and complement the National Program for Basic Education Development 2004\u20132009. \nThe TA will assess rural basic education and recommend strategies to further improve rural \neducation services. In 2005, MOPE completed a comprehensive review of school facilities and \nestablished \u201cschool passports\u201d to document the physical conditions and inventory of all schools. \nBased on the survey results, the TA will determine what investments are needed to improve rural \nschools. Areas of investment will include (i) minor school rehabilitation; (ii) provision of laboratory \nequipment; (iii) establishment of classroom libraries to strengthen literacy skills in Latin script, \nparticularly for students in the early grades; and (iv) provision of general teaching equipment, \nbasic teaching aids, and sports equipment. To improve access for students with special needs, \nthe TA will recommend providing them with adjusted furniture and special education equipment. \n \n14.  To identify schools for the project, a selection mechanism will be developed. The selection \ncriteria will consist of (i) high enrolment rates of students from poor families, (ii) active community \nparticipation  as  encouraged  under  the  Government\u2019s  oila-mahalla-maktab  (family-community-\nschool) concept, (iii) dynamic and proactive school management and school board, (iv) enough \nqualified teachers, and (v) evidence of adequate budget for operation and maintenance.  \n  \n15.
