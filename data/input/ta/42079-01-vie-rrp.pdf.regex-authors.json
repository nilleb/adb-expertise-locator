I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans to \nthe  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  the  University  of  Science  and  Technology  of  Hanoi \nDevelopment (New Model University) Project.  \n \n2.  The  project  seeks  to  establish  a  new  model  university  (NMU)  focused  on  international \nstandard teaching and research in science and technology. This NMU\u2014the University of Science and \nTechnology  of  Hanoi  (USTH)\u2014will  demonstrate  a  new  policy  framework  for  the  governance, \nfinancing,  and  quality  assurance  of  universities  in  Viet  Nam.  The  USTH  will  be  established  in \npartnership with the Government of France and the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology \n(VAST). The Government of France will provide about \u20ac100 million to support development and \noperating costs until at least 2020, including provision of curricula, research capacity, the rector, \nacademic staff, and scholarships. The USTH opened in October 2010 using facilities at VAST and \nenrollments are expected to reach 1,000 by 2014. It will migrate to its new campus at Hoa Lac High \nTech Park (HHTP), which is being developed in cooperation with the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, once it is ready. The World Bank approved the development of an NMU\u2014the Vietnamese\u2013\nGerman University\u2014in June 2010.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Economy. Viet Nam has been one of Asia\u2019s fastest-growing economies, with growth in real \ngross  domestic  product  (GDP)  averaging  7.4%  from  1989  to  2008.  Viet  Nam's  rapid  economic \ndevelopment has significantly changed the structure of the economy, with the industry share of GDP \ngrowing, and that of agriculture falling, between 1995 and 2005. The modernization of the Viet Nam \neconomy has had a big impact on the demand for skilled labor and the nature of skills required. There \nis  increasing  demand  for  skilled  workers  in  those  occupations  that  traditionally  recruit  tertiary \neducation graduates, and in developing sectors such as manufacturing and electricity. From 1998 to \n2004, the share of higher education graduates in the manufacturing, construction, and utilities sectors \nrose substantially in Viet Nam. Demand for skilled workers is being driven by both demand and supply \nfactors. \n \n4.  Achievements. The higher education system in Viet Nam has changed markedly since 1990. \nIn  2009\u20132010,  there  were  more than  1.79 million  Vietnamese  enrolled  in  376  higher  education \ninstitutions (HEIs), 150 of which award degrees, compared with just 162,000 students in 110 HEIs in \n1993, showing significantly increased access to higher education. Other improvements to the higher \neducation  system  include  a  shift  from  small  specialized  institutes  toward  larger  multidisciplinary \nuniversities, better integration of research within universities, and increased private financing and \ndelivery of higher education. Despite these developments in increasing system capacity, the higher \neducation system is ill-equipped to meet the needs of the fast-growing Vietnamese economy and the \nincreasing need for innovation and higher-order skills.  \n \n5.  Access and staffing. The higher education system could accommodate only one-third of those \nseeking admission in 2009. The gross enrollment ratio, estimated at no more than 16% in 2005, is \nbelow that of other high-performing countries such as the People\u2019s Republic of China (20%) and \nMalaysia (32%). Furthermore, there are wide disparities in access, with tertiary education enrollments \nfrom the richest quintile being about four times that of the lowest quintile. From 1987 to 2009, the \nstudent\u2013teacher ratio increased more than fourfold, to 29:1. There are wide differences across HEI \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. Project preparation was carried out through Asian Development \nBank (ADB). 2010. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Preparing the Higher Education Sector \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 7105-VIE). \n ", "2   \ntypes, with the student\u2013teacher ratio ranging from 15:1 at colleges to 54:1 at regional universities\u2014\nabove levels in many member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Staff quality is \nbelow requirements due to low salaries and the cumbersome promotion procedures that limit rewards \nfor academic achievement. Faculty qualifications are low, with less than half of academic staff having \npostgraduate qualifications, with most at the masters level. Quality control is also problematic.   \n \n6.  Governance. The governance of the higher education system is overly centralized and pays too \nlittle attention to quality, outputs, and outcomes. Public HEIs have limited governance and management \nautonomy\u2014university  enrollments  are  strictly  controlled  through  a  quota  system,  tuition  fees  are \ncapped, and the Ministry of Education and Training (MOET) makes most management decisions, \nincluding  appointing  the  rector  and  establishing  rules  on  budgeting,  spending,  and  personnel \nmanagement.  Academic  staff  are  poorly  paid  and,  because  they  are  public  servants,  the  rules \nsurrounding pay levels, staff promotion, and hiring and firing are made centrally. The MOET must \napprove institutional budgets.   \n \n7.  Financing. Viet Nam's total expenditure on colleges and universities in 2002 was  equal to just \n0.41% of GDP\u2014significantly lower than in other East Asian countries (1.62%) and lower than the 75 \ncountries reporting tertiary education expenditures to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and \nCultural Organization (1.22%). Public universities generate too little funding from private sources\u2014\nonly one-third of revenues, which compares with more than 80% for semipublic, people-founded, and \nprivate universities. Public universities also generate little revenue from contractual research and \ndevelopment\u2014only 1.3% of revenue, compared to 2.0%\u20132.5% for semipublic, people-founded, and \nprivate universities. Per-student spending on public universities was estimated at $400 in 2009.   \n \n8.  Innovation. The generation, diffusion, absorption, and application of new ideas are increasingly \nbeing seen as important factors in explaining economic growth and development. As the Vietnamese \neconomy evolves, innovation and skill are likely to be called upon to play an increasingly important role \nin driving economic growth and development. Unfortunately, Viet Nam scores poorly compared to key \nAsian neighbors such as Malaysia and Thailand on a range of innovation measures, including the \nnumber of researchers in research and development (R&D), total expenditure on R&D as a percentage \nof GDP, university\u2013company collaboration, and patents granted. The same is true for other indicators\u2014\ne.g., the number of peer-reviewed articles published by Vietnamese academics is low, and substantially \nlower than in neighboring countries. \n   \n9.  Research  and  development.  Developing  the  country\u2019s  teaching  and  research  base, \nparticularly in the area of science and technology, will be critical if Viet Nam is to transform itself into a \nmodern, industrialized nation. University R&D can positively affect economic development, while the \nperceived quality of research institutions and public\u2013private linkages are seen as having a significant \npositive impact on productivity and on the intensity of countries' R&D performance. In Viet Nam, the \nhigher education system does not play the role of innovation incubator or provider of skilled labor that \nit  does  in  successful  middle-income  countries,  thus  constraining  knowledge  creation\u2014a  key  to \nimproved productivity and competitiveness. This owes much to the weak state of higher education \nresearch in the country, which is due to factors such as low levels of state and nonstate research \nfunding, the separation of teaching (typically conducted at universities) and research (conducted at \nspecialized  research  organizations),  a  lack  of  research  being  undertaken  by  higher  education \nacademics, a lack of qualified academic staff, and limited numbers of postgraduate students.    \n \n10.  Higher Education Reform Agenda 2006\u20132020. The Government of Viet Nam recognizes the \nneed to address higher education challenges, as reflected in the Higher Education Reform Agenda \n(HERA), its strategy for developing a competitive higher education system with advanced teaching \nand research capacity. The HERA\u2019s main objectives are to (i) dramatically increase the participation \nrate in universities, (ii) boost quality and efficiency, (iii) strengthen research capacity in universities, \nand (iv) improve governance of the higher education system.  \n ", "  3 \n \n11.  Key features. The project focuses on improving the teaching and research capacity of the \nViet Nam higher education system by supporting the establishment of an NMU with (i) governance \nand management autonomy; (ii) a curriculum that fosters innovation and cross-disciplinary work, \nsupported by the appropriate facilities; (iii) more flexible staffing and pay arrangements; (iv) higher \nlevels of state recurrent funding, including research funding; and (v) increased scope for generating \nprivate revenue through tuition fees and other means. More broadly, the project will pilot the more \nflexible  policy  framework  developed  during  project  preparation,  which  will  be  refined  during \nimplementation, to serve as a basis for reforms that would allow it to be extended to other HEIs. The \nproject places considerable emphasis on building strong links between the USTH and the private sector to \nensure the quality and relevance of its teaching and research and to increase the institution\u2019s operating \nrevenues. The USTH council will include private sector membership. The industry engagement center \nwithin the USTH will be a key channel for enhancing public\u2013private links through developing regular \ninteractions  with  industry,  establishing  knowledge  exchange  and  technology  transfer  services, \ncommercializing research, and developing industry internships for staff and students. The USTH will also \ndevelop a foundation to solicit philanthropic contributions from industry.   \n \n12.  Development partner support to the higher education sector. A number of development \npartners  operate  in  the  higher  education  sector  in  Viet  Nam,  including  the World  Bank,  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency, France, and the Netherlands. The World Bank\u2019s Second Higher \nEducation Project2 and Higher Education Development Policy Program3 support the implementation \nof the government\u2019s Socio-Economic Development Plan and HERA. The Second Higher Education \nProject seeks to increase the quality of teaching and research in universities to improve graduate \nemployability and research relevance by developing policy and building central government capacity, \nand  building  capacity,  relevance,  and  autonomy  at  the  university  level.  The  Higher  Education \nDevelopment Policy Program aims to strengthen governance, rationalize financing, improve teaching \nand research, increase accountability, and improve financial management in the higher education \nsector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) project is part of a two-track approach to achieving policy \nreform in higher education, with the institutional focus of ADB and World Bank NMUs complementing \nthe broader reforms under the Second Higher Education Project and Higher Education Development \nPolicy Program. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department supported the establishment of RMIT \nInternational University Viet Nam in 2001.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The expected impact of the project is improved performance of the higher education system in \nViet Nam. The performance target is that Viet Nam\u2019s rank on the innovation pillar of the World \nEconomic Forum\u2019s Global Competitiveness Index increases from 49th in 2010 to 45th by 2022. The \nproject's  expected  outcome  is  a  high-quality  NMU  that  generates  industry-relevant  science  and \ntechnology teaching and research.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The project will deliver four outputs: (i) an effective management and governance system for \nthe USTH will be developed and implemented, (ii) systems to promote high-quality and relevant \nacademic programs at the USTH will be developed and implemented, (iii) physical facilities at the \nUSTH will be constructed and outfitted, and (iv) effective project management and implementation.   \n \n                                                \n2  World Bank. 2007.

The USTH will establish the university implementation unit, which will (i) implement activities \nunder  outputs  1  and  2,  (ii)  manage  the  contracting  and  provide  oversight  of  USTH\u2019s  internal \nmanagement and academic development, (iii) determine the specifications and lists of specialized \nequipment for laboratories and the library, (iv) liaise closely with the construction project manager to \nsupport the design specifications of the buildings and laboratories, and (v) liaise with the project \nmanager who will organize the procurement and installation of equipment. The UIU will be headed by \na manager and will have at least 11 full-time-equivalent staff.   \n \n24.  The government asked ADB to approve advance action and retroactive financing to expedite \nthe recruitment of consultants. ADB advised the government that any approval of advance action and \nretroactive financing do not commit ADB to financing the project.   \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  The direct beneficiaries of the project will be the approximately 5,000 students who, in any \ngiven year, will be enrolled at the USTH once the new facilities have been constructed and who will \ntherefore benefit from attendance at an international-standard university focused on science and \ntechnology. In particular, students will benefit from improved teaching, international standard curricula, \nand  teaching  facilities.  Approximately  100  female  students  at  any  given  time  will  benefit  from \nscholarship assistance to attend the USTH. The new dormitory accommodation will benefit some \n1,800 students at any given time, of which approximately 40% will be female. Academic staff and \nstudents  at  the  USTH  and  researchers  at  VAST  will  benefit  significantly  from  the  provision  of \ninternational-standard  research  laboratories  and  equipment,  as  well  as  extended  networks  with \nresearchers from around the world. Academic staff and administrators will benefit from the extensive \ntraining and mentoring programs provided under the project.  \n \n26.  Viet Nam industrial development will benefit indirectly from an injection of higher-skilled and \nmore productive workers and the utilization of outputs of locally conducted science and technology \nresearch that is expected to boost capacity for innovation and expansion. The public will benefit \nindirectly through increases in socioeconomic development over time, as the NMU contributes higher \nskills that facilitate Vietnam\u2019s progress through medium-income status and underpins the country\u2019s \nmove to more intensive industrialization. The higher education system will benefit from training and \nhigher skill acquisition and new facilities for Vietnamese researchers who might otherwise  work \nabroad. Future students will directly benefit from improved educational outcomes, better employment \nprospects, and a higher rate of return on skills.   \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n27.  The project funds the construction of a new greenfield campus for a science and technology \nuniversity of international standard, including the building and equipping of leading-edge science \nlaboratories  for  postgraduate  research  and  teaching.  The  local  construction  industry  has  little \nexperience in managing such projects. The project will use international firms to manage the design, \nconstruction, and fit out of the USTH. The French international partner will provide doctorate training \nin France for future USTH academic staff. The project will fund capacity building for laboratory \nmaintenance and training of technicians, and will also support the government to develop more \nappropriate policies and approaches to (i) providing sustainable levels of recurrent financing for \nresearch activities, and (ii) depreciation to support a systematic maintenance and replacement plan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.   The  economic  benefits  of  the  project  will  flow  from  increased  numbers  of  science  and \ntechnology graduates, and from industry utilization of more, and more relevant, locally conducted \nscience and technology research, which is expected to boost innovation. The output of graduates \n ", "8   \nfrom the USTH will be significant at postgraduate level, particularly as regards graduates of high \nquality in science and technology. The USTH will provide a quantum injection of science teaching and \nresearch capacity and, at initial design capacity of 5,000 students, will increase research outputs of \ndoctorate students in Viet Nam and research publications. Development of this high-caliber science \ncapacity will support the development of a more highly industrialized economy, and will take at least a \ngeneration to mature. Viet Nam needs to start its expanded investment now to ensure it keeps pace \nwith its planned rate of industrialization. Costs per graduate will be high relative to current levels, but \nrates of return to higher education are increasing. No rate of return has been calculated given the \nnovelty of this type of investment in Viet Nam and the paucity of relevant data.  \n \n29.  Financial sustainability. The USTH is projected to absorb about 2% of higher education \nsystem resources (exclusive of loan repayments) by 2020. These estimates allow for some increase \nin unit costs at the USTH, as will be necessary to progress upwards through regional and global \nuniversity  rankings,  and  to  sustain  the  university\u2019s  asset  base.  In  assessing  long-term  financial \nsustainability, the government will need to take into account the significant costs projected for both \nNMUs,  not  just  the  USTH.  To  ensure  financial  sustainability  in  the  years  immediately  following \nestablishment, the government will develop a special financing mechanism that will provide recurrent \nfunding for the USTH at rates per student that are well above those provided to existing public \nuniversities. In addition, the USTH will benefit from substantial assistance from the Government of \nFrance in the form of management and academic staff and curriculum, at least until 2020. The USTH \nwill also benefit increasingly from private sector revenue in the form of tuition fees, consulting, and \nresearch income. Tuition fees will be well above those charged by other public universities.      \n  \nC.  Governance  \n \n30.  Financial management and procurement capacity assessments of the MOET and PMU-UE \nwere conducted and found that they will face significant challenges in implementing the project unless \nmitigating measures are instituted. The key concern is that the MOET is responsible for implementing \nmany projects, including from ADB, the World Bank, bilateral development partners, and government \nprojects  in  neighboring  countries.  This  heavy  workload,  coupled  with  limits  on  the  number  and \ncapacity of staff, would tax the ability of the MOET and PMU-UE to carry out timely and effective \nprocurement  and  disbursements.  The  financial  management  assessment  highlighted  the  limited \ncapacity, lack of finance and accounting staff, and the existence of two accounting systems operating \nwithin the MOET, which could create confusion during implementation. \n \n31.  The MOET will hire additional qualified finance and accounting officers to strengthen existing \nPMU-UE staff. The PMU-UE will address the accounting system issue and will urgently procure \naccounting software. The procurement office of MOET is familiar with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time) and requirements, as it has worked with ADB for many years. \nThe limited number of qualified staff to support ongoing projects is a concern, as is the lack of \ntechnical expertise within the MOET and the PMU-UE in the procurement of science laboratories and \nequipment.  PMU-UE  staff  indicated  that  they  will  recruit  qualified  and  experienced  procurement \nspecialists  to  ensure  that  the  availability  of  human  resources  is  in  line  with  the  procurement \nrequirements for the implementation of such a large civil works project. International experts will \nsupport PMU-USTH in the procurement and management of the complex construction contracts. The \nproject also splits procurement between PMU-USTH and the UIU, with the latter responsible for the \nacademic and university management outputs.   \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and the MOET. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the project administration manual.4 \n                                                \n4  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  9 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  Key issues related to poverty and social equity in higher education relate to affordability. \nStudents from poor and lower-income families have limited access to fee-paying HEIs. Further, the \nlack of high-quality primary and secondary education limits students\u2019 (especially those from ethnic \ngroups and in remote areas) access to postsecondary education. The project addresses to some \ndegree these constraints through the provision of scholarships to attend the USTH, allocation of \ndormitory spaces for poor and disadvantaged students including girls, secondary school outreach \nprograms, and provision of student support services.5 \n \n34.  Gender and development. The project is categorized as gender mainstreaming. It includes \nelements that address key constraints on female participation in higher education in science and \ntechnology fields, female perceptions of science and technology studies and careers, and gender \nimbalance among academic staff. The project includes a gender action plan (GAP) to facilitate and \npromote increased female participation and benefits from the project. The GAP addresses access and \nequity issues by setting targets and gender-responsive design features, including (i) development and \nimplementation of equity strategies, such as scholarships, outreach programs, and mentoring; (ii) \nreservation of 40% of dormitory places for girls; (iii) a quota of 20% females in senior management, \nacademic staff, and university council positions; (iv) 30% female representation in capacity-building \nprograms; (v) gender balance in industry placement programs; (vi) provision of gender training to key \nstakeholders; (vii) gender-inclusive design of physical facilities; and (viii) development of monitoring \nand evaluation indicators to track GAP implementation.6  \n \n35.  Ethnic groups. No ethnic group development plan has been prepared as the USTH is unlikely \nto have a significant impact on ethnic groups given its selective nature and the underrepresentation of \nethnic groups in higher education.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  The involuntary resettlement category is A. The site requires clearance and resettlement, with \nover 300 affected persons identified for resettlement and/or compensation. A resettlement plan has \nbeen  prepared.  The  total  cost  of  resettlement  compensation  is  estimated  at  $3.0  million.  The \nindigenous peoples\u2019 categorization is C, as the project is not expected to have either positive or \nnegative impacts on indigenous people. The environmental categorization is B. During construction of \nthe campus, contractors will keep noise and dust within locally acceptable levels, and manage fill, \nexcavated material, and solid waste in a way that does not create a permanent impact. Guidelines \nhave been prepared to ensure that buildings, especially laboratories, are secure and capable of \nproper management of toxic materials. Water supply in the dormitories will meet national drinking \nwater quality standards.   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n37.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.7 The major risks are: (i) the government fails to provide \nthe appropriate management and academic autonomy and levels of recurrent funding required for the \nUSTH to meet international standards for teaching and research, (ii) the foreign strategic partner \nwithdraws support for the USTH or cannot sustain support at a level required for capacity building, \nand (iii) campus construction is delayed due to slower-than-anticipated development of the HHTP or \ndelays in government approval of the USTH site plan.     \n                                                \n5  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked docs in Appendix 2). \n7  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nOutcome   \nPolicy framework underlying new model university \nGovernment of Viet Nam abandons commitment to the  concept is set out in USTH charter.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n38.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the project shall conform to all \napplicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, \nprocurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan agreement. The \nassurances include commitments to implement governance and funding frameworks that ensure that \nthe USTH can operate at an international standard.   \n \n39.  Conditions for loan disbursement. Before the disbursement of the loans from OCR and \nADFHT, the government will have established the PMU-USTH, and the UIU.       \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n \n40.
