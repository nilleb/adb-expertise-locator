The regional cooperation and integration strategy adopted by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in 2006 identified trade and investment as one of its four pillars (pillar 2). The \nstrategy provides the basis for ADB\u2019s capacity building initiatives in the area of regional trade. \nTrade policy capacity varies significantly across Asia and the Pacific, with some (e.g., the South \nAsian economies) lacking the skills needed to take advantage of new opportunities created by \nglobal  and  regional  integration.  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  the  Office  of  Regional \nEconomic  Integration  (OREI)  are  engaged  in  various  capacity  building  activities  for  ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). This technical assistance (TA)1 seeks to strengthen \nADB\u2019s existing efforts at the regional level to enhance the capacity of DMCs to trade effectively \nand efficiently. Broad-based participation through stronger public\u2013private partnership (PPP) and \neffective coordination with other trade-related projects in the region are crucial to adopting an \nintegrated and pragmatic regional approach to trade. The TA will therefore be implemented in \npartnership with global (e.g., the World Trade Organization [WTO]) and regional institutions \n(such  as  the  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n[UNESCAP], Association of Southeast Asian Nations [ASEAN], and South Asian Association for \nRegional  Cooperation  [SAARC]).  The  TA  deals  with  four  interrelated  components.  These \ninclude capacity building in the broad sense through the Aid for Trade (AFT) Road Map, support \nfor regional trade facilitation, training courses on free trade agreements (FTAs), and support for \nsubregional trade integration.2\nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB has actively supported trade integration and facilitation through the years as a \nmeans to increase investment and trade, and, ultimately, to reduce poverty in the region. ADB\u2019s \nexperience includes conducting several training courses;3 a manual on designing, negotiating, \nand implementing FTAs;4 support for subregional integration in East Asia (e.g., capacity building \nfor the ASEAN Secretariat);5 a number of subregional initiatives on trade facilitation through the \nCentral Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) and the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Programs; and a high-level AFT conference in September 2007 in Manila6 that reviewed \nthe trade capacity building needs and discussed the necessity for increased AFT resources for \nthe Asia and the Pacific region. These experiences bode well in the medium term for developing \nDMCs\u2019 capacity to take advantage of regional and global trading opportunities.  \n3. Need  to  Address  Trade-Related  Constraints.  Trade-related constraints are widely \nacknowledged at both the national and regional levels,7 although issues have not been dealt \nwith via a pragmatic regional approach. Consensus is needed to effectively use developmental \naid interventions in trade-related activities for boosting trade capacities, and particularly for the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared inthe business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 June 2008.  \n2  Such support is likely to include capacity building and technical support to the SAARC Secretariat, Pacific Islands \nForum, and other regional secretariats.  \n3  ADB. 2006.

Institutional support for international trade is also \ncrucial to minimizing the costs from distorting trade policies and procedures. \n4. Need to Increase Support for Regional Trade Facilitation. Trade facilitation requires \nadopting efficient and transparent methods to facilitate the trade in goods. At the national level, \nindividual countries have implemented measures to improve trade, but a recent study has \nindicated that, individually, countries cannot fully realize the benefits from trade facilitation \nprograms.8 The  study  reemphasizes  the  need  for  a  regional  approach  to  trade-facilitating \nreforms. ADB and other regional institutions in Asia, such as UNESCAP, have initiated hard9\nand soft10 infrastructure activities to enhance trade flows in the region. But Asia and the Pacific \nstill lack a central regional venue, similar to the World Economic Forum, that would regularly \nbring together global and regional partners, as well as public\u2013private stakeholders, to discuss \ntrade  facilitation  issues.  Equally  important  is  to  promote  knowledge  development  and \ndissemination of best practice on trade facilitation so that DMCs and stakeholders will have a \nbetter, practical appreciation of trade facilitation reforms. \n5. Need to Enhance Public\u2013Private Partnerships in Trade-Related Activities. The role \nof the private sector is important in enhancing trade integration and facilitating trade. Many of \nthe investments needed to develop DMC trading capacities are best undertaken through PPPs \nto take advantage of the synergy of government and the business sector.11\n6. Need to Increase Capacity of Trade Officials. The Asia and Pacific region has a \nplethora of FTAs, and the limited capacity of DMC officials is overstretched. Recognizing this \nconstraint, ADB organized several FTA training courses between 2006 and 2008.12 With the \nproliferation of new-style comprehensive FTAs in the region, there is also a continuing need to \nprovide DMCs capacity building to ensure a sustainable pool of qualified trade officials. \n7. Need to Initiate Stronger Support for Deeper Subregional Trade Integration. ADB \nsupports nurturing a multi-track and multi-speed approach to regional integration for Asia\u2019s \nvarious  subregions  (including  South  Asia,  the  Pacific,  Central  Asia,  and  the  GMS)  with \ninterventions for specific needs to permit participation in integration processes. For instance, \nmany of the FTAs in South Asia, Central Asia, and the Pacific states are still characterized by \nsmall product coverage and narrow preference margins. To realize the FTAs\u2019 full potential for \nincreasing the Asian subregions\u2019 market access, it is necessary to deepen regional integration \n(beyond just trade in goods). Capacity building and technical support to various subregional \nentities (e.g., the SAARC Secretariat) can assist in this integration.\n8.  Building upon ADB\u2019s experience and partnership with global and regional development \ninstitutions, this project aims to provide continuous technical assistance and capacity building in \norder to sustain and deepen the integration and trade facilitation efforts of DMCs in the region. \n                                                \n8  Maur, Jean-Christophe. 2008.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA\u2019s impact will be expansion of trade and investment in Asia and the Pacific \nthrough an integrated and pragmatic regional approach. Capacity building will enable DMCs to \nmaximize the benefits of trade policy and facilitation initiatives in the region. The envisaged \noutcomes are more awareness of trade-related needs and an effective approach to closing \nregional gaps through AFT; a regional approach and strengthened PPPs in trade facilitation; \nand enhanced institutional capacity of DMCs for dealing with FTAs and deepening subregional \ntrade integration.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  assist  DMCs  in  improving  trade  policy  formation  and  strengthening \ninstitutional capacity for trade facilitation and integration. This will include four main components:   \n11. Component 1: Aid for Trade Road Map for Asia and the Pacific. This will define \nregional trade-related constraints and design an effective regional AFT approach. As agreed \nduring the first AFT Review in Manila (chaired by ADB President Haruhiko Kuroda and WTO \nDirector-General Pascal Lamy in September 2007, and as reported by the Managing Director-\nGeneral to the Global AFT Review in Geneva in November 2007) future steps in the regional \nAFT agenda include the following: \n(i)  The Regional Technical Group on Aid for Trade for Asia and the Pacific (to \nconvene  in  late  2008),  consisting  of  senior  technical-level  representatives  of \nrecipient countries, bilateral donors, and regional and multilateral institutions. \nADB will be a member of the regional technical group and coordinate its work. \nThe technical working group will meet at least twice (once in Manila and again in \nGeneva) during 2008\u20132010. \n(ii)  The Proposal for Aid for Trade in Asia and the Pacific. A succinct, regional \nproposal will be crafted by the regional technical group to provide a practical \nframework  for  operationalizing  AFT  in  the  region.  It  is  envisaged  that  the \nproposal will synthesize specific AFT needs, objectives, activities, and actors; it \nwill include an implementation schedule, define financing needs, and structure a \nmonitoring framework based on the Paris Principles. The draft proposal will be \ncirculated for comments to relevant stakeholders and presented at regional and \ninternational forums.\n(iii)  The  Study  on  Trade  Performance  and  Aid  for  Trade  in  Asia-Pacific.  A \ncomplement to the proposal, this planned knowledge product in 2009 will analyze \ntrade performance among countries representing the diversity of Asia and the \nPacific.  The  study\u2019s  findings  are  expected  to  be  disseminated  as  widely  as \npossible through various websites and conferences. \n12. Component  2:  Support  for  Regional  Trade Facilitation.  This component aims to \npromote adopting effective regional trade facilitation measures, strengthen trade facilitation \ninitiatives through strong PPPs, and enhance trade facilitation capacity. The TA envisages two \nactivities: publication of a trade facilitation manual (2009\u20132010), and a high-level conference in \n2009 to promote eventual formation of a regional trade facilitation forum. This will complement \nADB\u2019s and UNESCAP\u2019s ongoing regional and subregional trade facilitation initiatives (e.g., the ", "4\nCAREC  and  GMS  trade  facilitation  programs).13 The  component  will  be  implemented  in \ncollaboration  with  UNESCAP14 and  coordination  with  regional  departments  (and  especially \nthose with subregional trade facilitation programs).  \n13.  A manual on trade facilitation will be developed that will draw on ADB\u2019s expertise and \ntechnical reports on trade facilitation, UNESCAP\u2019s trade facilitation handbooks,15 and ADB\u2019s \nFTA  manual.16 The  manual  on  trade  facilitation  is  envisaged  to  include  (i)  a  conceptual \nframework on trade facilitation (which will provide a definition of trade facilitation); (ii) indicators \nfor  assessing  customs  needs  and  behind-the-border  issues  on  logistics,  quarantine,  and \nstandards; and (iii) case studies that will highlight best practice in implementing trade facilitation \ninitiatives  (including  the  ASEAN  single-window,  GMS  cross-border  agreements,  customs \nmodernization, trade finance facilitation program, and PPPs). A dissemination plan will be drawn \nup to include posting on ADB and UNESCAP websites plus regional and in-country launch \nexercises.  \n14.  A high-level regional conference on trade facilitation will be conducted in 2009 to provide \na venue for sharing best-practice experiences in trade facilitation initiatives, as well as to assist \nin bringing regional players together and promoting PPPs in trade facilitation. The conference \nwill be organized in collaboration with such global and regional partners as the WTO, World \nCustoms Organization (WCO), and UNESCAP. The conference may become a regular event.17\n15. Component  3:  Training  Courses  on  Designing,  Negotiating,  and  Implementing \nFTAs. Two regional training courses, with participants from all subregions in Asia and the \nPacific, will be conducted during 2009\u20132010.18 The courses aim to enhance the technical and \nanalytical skills of DMC trade officials involved in FTAs and equip them with the necessary \ntools for undertaking FTAs, such as (i) background concepts and trends, (ii) designing best \npractice FTAs, and (iii) strategizing FTA negotiation and implementation. The training courses \nwill build upon ADB\u2019s FTA training programs.19 The FTA manual (footnote 16) as well as the \nenvisaged trade facilitation manual will be used as part of the core course materials. New trade \nissues (e.g., WTO-plus provisions on trade facilitation and cooperation enhancement) will be \ndealt with extensively. The courses will involve a mix of formal presentations, case studies, \ngroup  work,  discussions  on  trends  among  FTAs  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  and  simulation \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2007.

", "5\nexercises. There will be practical group exercises on using ADB\u2019s FTA and trade indicators \ndatabases (www.aric.adb.org), as well as simulated trade negotiations. OREI will manage the \ntraining courses. Training will be conducted by international experts and experienced FTA \nnegotiators, experts from international (e.g., WTO) and regional entities (e.g., ASEAN and \nSAARC), and ADBI and ADB staff (OREI and regional departments).  \n16. Component  4:  Support  for  Deepening  Subregional  Trade  Integration.  This\ncomponent aims to provide capacity building for extending the scope of subregional FTAs (such \nas the South Asia Free Trade Agreement and the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement) \ninto  such  new  areas  as  services  and  investment.  This  type  of  TA  has  been  specifically \nrequested by the SAARC and the Indian Government during an ADB consultation mission to \nNew Delhi, India on 5 and 7 March 2008 and in consultations between ADB staff and a SAARC \nSecretariat official.20 Leveraging on ADB\u2019s completed and ongoing research activities,21 and in \nclose consultation with Asian DMCs, a study on new issues22 in FTAs in Asia and the Pacific23\nwill be carried out in 2009 and widely disseminated through the ADB website and a workshop in \n2010. A workshop may also be held with various regional secretariats on how to implement \nliberalization in such new areas as services, investment, and intellectual property rights, as well \nas regarding other integration initiatives.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. It will cover remuneration, travel, and per \ndiems  for  international  and  national  consultants  and  resource  persons;  conference-related \nexpenditures; travel costs for participants; other training expenditures; publication of the trade \nfacilitation manual, studies, and reports; equipment rentals; and miscellaneous expenses. A \ndetailed cost breakdown and proposed financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. OREI will administer and implement the \nTA with support from the regional departments. DMCs will be consulted on the priority topics for \nthe  studies,  FTA  training,  and  workshops.  ADB,  WTO,  donor  agencies,  and  regional \ndevelopment  partners  will  collaborate  under  component  1.  ADB  will  work  closely  with \nUNESCAP  and  the  WCO  in  activities  under  component  2.  An  annex  to  the  existing \nmemorandum  of  understanding  with  UNESCAP  will  be  prepared  defining  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of ADB and UNESCAP in implementing component 2. ADB will coordinate with \nregional  organizations  (e.g.,  ASEAN  and  SAARC)  in  implementing  component  3  and  with \nsubregional entities (such as SAARC and the Pacific Island Forum states) for component 4.  \n19.  The TA will require approximately 5 person-months of international and 20 person-\nmonths of national consulting services. In addition, it will require 1.5 person-months (combined) \n                                                \n20 Director for Economic, Trade, and Finance Division, SAARC Secretariat.  \n21 Including ADB. 2005.
