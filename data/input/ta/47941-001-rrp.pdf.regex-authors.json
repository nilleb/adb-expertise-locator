THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $40 million to Ocean Sparkle Limited (OSL) (to be disbursed in Indian rupees and/or US \ndollars) for the Ocean Sparkle Expansion Project in India. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description  \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  India  is  the  world\u2019s  third  largest  economy  by  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  with \n7,517 kilometers of coastline\u2014making it one of the major destinations and hubs for global trade. \nIndia\u2019s ports play a vital role, as almost 95% of the volume and 70% of the value of India\u2019s \nglobal merchandise trade is carried by maritime transport.1 While world trade increased at a \ncompound annual growth rate of 11.7% during 2000\u20122007, India\u2019s trade growth was 19.8%.2 In \nline with this trend, merchandise trade (the sum of merchandise exports and imports) in India \nhas grown rapidly, from 30.5% of GDP in 2009 to almost 42.5% in 2012.3 Accordingly, the 12th \nFive Year Plan of the Government of India gives high priority to ports, with the budget allocation \nfor  ports  149%  higher  than  in  the  previous  five-year  plan.4 The  objective  of  the  Maritime \nAgenda, 2010\u20122020 prepared by the Ministry of Shipping is not only to create more capacity, \nbut also to enhance port performance to reduce transaction costs significantly and make Indian \nports globally competitive and efficient.5 The agenda states that public funds are planned to be \nmainly deployed for common use infrastructure facilities (e.g., deepening of port channels, and \nrail and road connectivity from ports to hinterland) while most investment for the port sector \n(e.g., cargo handling equipment and operating berths) is expected to come from the private \nsector under public\u2012private partnerships. The focus is to add capacity and infuse efficiency in \norder to enhance trade volumes.  \n   \n3.  According to the Maritime Agenda, an investment of Rs1,094 billion will be required in \nmajor ports and Rs1,679 billion in non-major ports to create additional capacity. The private \nsector is expected to fund 66.0% of the projects in major ports and 96.1% in non-major ports in \nthree phases until 2020.6 In addition to capacity investment, private sector participation in port \noperation and management (O&M) service is expected to lead to improved efficiency, reduce \nturnaround time (average time spent by a ship from its entry into port waters until its departure), \nand make Indian ports more competitive through the introduction of the latest technology and \nbetter management practices. Providers of specialized maritime services such as OSL can \nbenefit from this drive to improve O&M efficiency at newly developed or expanded ports.7 \n                                                \n1  The World Bank.

", "2      \n \n4.  Established in 1995, OSL is a market leader with a majority share of privatized and \noutsourced port O&M services in India. The company has sound commercial, technical, and \nfinancial fundamentals, and a proven record that has increased its market share by consistently \ndelivering quality of service and value to its customers.  \n \n5.  OSL approached the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for long-term financing for its \ngrowth in domestic and international markets. With ADB assistance, OSL aims to bring more \nefficient O&M services to ports. This will not only help in providing safe and efficient operations \nbut also reduce turnaround time\u2014eventually enhancing India\u2019s port competitiveness to handle \nhigher cargo and export volumes.  \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The proposed financing will support funding of OSL\u2019s capital expenditure (CAPEX) plan \nuntil 2016. All vessels are expected to be sourced from the international market. The acquisition \nprocess will be sequenced to ensure full vessel utilization and is scheduled to be completed \nwithin 24 months. These vessels will enhance the efficiency of ports where OSL operates \nthrough more competitive and efficiently run harbor towage, mooring, and pilotage operations.  \n   \n3.  The Borrower  \n7.  OSL and its subsidies and joint venture companies (the OSL group) are engaged in the \nacquisition  of  marine  vessels  and  the  provision  of  such  vessels  for  comprehensive  port \nmanagement services across major, non-major, and captive ports in India. OSL\u2019s fleet includes \n78 tugs, 10 pilot launches, five mooring launches, six dredgers, and five barges. OSL\u2019s port \nmanagement services can be broken down into four segments: (i) port management services, \nincluding pilotage, harbor towage, and O&M of port marine crafts; ship traffic management and \ncommunications; mooring of ships and upkeep of mooring equipment; upkeep of navigational \naids; and maintenance of navigational channels; (ii) ship-to-ship transfer operations of crude \nand/or cargo at open sea resulting from ports\u2019 lack of capacity to berth large vessels because of \ndraft restrictions; (iii) cargo lighterage operations necessitated to resolve issues of  congestion \nor draft restriction at ports; and (iv) maintenance and environmental dredging.  \n \n \n8.  OSL has an ICRA rating of A+ (stable) on its term loans, cash credit, and non-fund \nbased limits.8 According to the most recent assessment by ICRA Limited (ICRA), the stable \nrating reflects OSL\u2019s long record, considerable experience, and very strong market position; the \nmedium-to-long tenure of its customer contracts; presence of take-or-pay provisions, resulting in \nassured revenue streams; a good record in securing repeat business; a healthy bidding success \nrate for new contracts; and sound profitability and liquidity profile. OSL has enjoyed robust \nfinancial performance over the past 3 years with strong liquidity, asset turnover (indication of its \nability to roll over contracts), coverage, and leverage ratios. ICRA also forecasts that OSL\u2019s \nratings will be strengthened by the favorable long-term demand outlook for port O&M services, \ndriven by the large-scale ongoing and proposed port developments in India. \n  \n \n \n                                                \n8  ICRA.  2013.

", "3 \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n1.  Impact  \n9.  The development impact includes the growth of private sector participation in India\u2019s port \noperations through facilitating new investment in the sector, which will help to foster confidence \namong potential investors and lenders and promote private sector investment in India\u2019s port \nsector. The increase in global competitiveness has placed tremendous demands on improving \nand  optimizing  maritime  infrastructure.  The  proposed  financing  will  help  to  increase  the \ncompetitiveness  of  major  and  non-major  ports,  and  bring  growth  and  opportunities  to  the \nsurrounding areas by catalyzing and strengthening the private sector development of India\u2019s \nport operations and maritime infrastructure.  \n \n2.  Outcome \n10.  The financing of OSL\u2019s growth will contribute to increasing efficiency and safety in port \noperations  by  supporting  private  sector  expansion  in  port  O&M  services.  OSL  will  apply \ninternational standards in its port operations and make the necessary investments to reduce \ncosts and delays in major ports, which is a major concern for the growth of Indian ports. The \nproject  endeavors to  reduce in turnaround time at OSL-operated ports from 3.75 days in \nFY2013 to 3.40 days in FY2018, as Indian ports have scope for improvement compared with \nother Asian ports.9 This will eventually lead to an increase in the total volume of cargo handled \nand a reduction in the number of pre- and post-berthing accidents.10 \n \n3.  Outputs \n11.   Successful  implementation  will  result  in  the  capacity  expansion  of  port  operations \nOctober 2016. The project will ensure that environment and safeguards standards are well \nmaintained and fully met. OSL\u2019s expansion  has potential to create 250 direct jobs in addition to \nother indirect employment opportunities in the ports O&M sector.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 and Country Strategy \n12.  The proposed financing is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and the Midterm Review \nof  Strategy  2020  as  it  (i)  promotes  export-led  growth  through  infrastructure  investment, \n(ii) enhances connectivity and regional integration, and (iii) promotes private sector participation \nin the ports sector in Asia. 11 The country partnership strategy (CPS) for India, 2013\u20122017 \nhighlights  transport  and  finance  for  infrastructure  as  two  of  the  seven  core  areas  under \ninfrastructure development that support faster growth in India. The project is also aligned with \nthe  CPS  priority  areas,  specifically  with  regard  to  port  development  and  support  for  the \ninfrastructure sector through nonsovereign operations.12  \n \n                                                \n9 Turnaround times at major Asian ports are Taipei,China (0.71 days); Hong Kong, China (0.72 days); and Singapore \n(1.16 days). In India, the average turnaround time at major ports is just below 4 days as of FY2014. \n10 C. Ducruet and O. Merk. 2013. Examining container vessel turnaround times across the world.

Manila. \n ", "4      \n \n2.   Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations \n13.  The  project  is  also  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative, 13  which \nacknowledges  under  the  regional  cooperation  and  integration  section  the  importance  of \naddressing trade growth constraints, such as indirect costs associated with unreliable transit \ntimes, border crossing delays, and handling costs resulting from poor terminal infrastructure.  \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n14.  Table 4 summarizes the implementation arrangements.14 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  OSL operates under mid-long term contracts with the port trusts. The tariff at major \nports is regulated by the TAMP. Indian ports levy two types of tariffs: (i) vessel tariffs \n(covering port dues, berth hire, pilotage, lighterage, and towage), and from which \nports pay specialized O&M operators such as OSL; and (ii) cargo tariffs (covering \ncargo handling and wharfage). The general framework affecting competition in ports \nO&M in India, as elsewhere, is governed by cabotage laws of the Directorate General \nof Shipping, under which country flag vessels get first preference in the ports O&M \nsector. However, this is being relaxed\u2014opening up the ports and shipping sector, \nincreasing competition, and bringing more sector efficiency. \nImplementation period  2014\u20132016 \nOperations arrangements  OSL provides comprehensive port O&M services and operates independently or \n(keeping in view tender requirements, and or legal or tax concerns) through its \nsubsidiaries and joint ventures. All OSL port O&M operations are carried out in-house \nby its team of tug masters, pilots, and mooring crew, all of whom are required to \npossess the necessary sea qualifications and/or licenses from government and state \nauthorities in addition to substantial seafaring experience. Additionally, OSL owns \nand operates its own training center with a  simulator, which allows its key technical \nstaff to experience real-time situations and various scenarios that may occur during \noperations. Technical staff are also sent overseas on specialist courses, particularly \nrelated to engine and other machinery maintenance. \nOperation and maintenance  Operation and maintenance of its vessels are carried out by OSL\u2019s own staff.  \nPerformance monitoring  Key performance indicators, including output and outcome indicators, will be reported \nby OSL and monitored by ADB.   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IFC = International Finance Corporation, O&M = operation and maintenance, \nOSL = Ocean Sparkle Limited, TAMP = Tariff Authority of Major Ports. \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Ocean Sparkle Limited. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n15.  ADB will provide a corporate finance loan of up to $40 million in US dollars or Indian \nrupees, or a combination thereof.   \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n16.  ADB\u2019s participation will provide long-term US dollar and Indian rupee loans presently \nunavailable in the market because of asset liability mismatches. It is important for OSL to have \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan.

", "5 \n \nlong tenor loans to amortize the high up-front costs of its capital-intensive marine vessels over \nlonger periods given their long asset life; this better matches the fixed-price nature of take-or-\npay offtake contracts. \n \n17.  The loan will affirm ADB\u2019s confidence in India\u2019s port sector\u2014a sector that forms the \nbackbone of country\u2019s economic growth and trade potential. To date, ADB has supported policy \nreforms in the sector through various loans and technical assistance projects, including those \nthat  directly  led  to  greater  private  sector  port  involvement  and  investment.  The  proposed \nfinancing by ADB\u2019s private sector operations\u2015the first in India\u2019s port sector\u2015complements \nADB\u2019s public sector operations in South Asia, such as the Colombo Port Expansion Project in \nSri Lanka, which enhances transshipment capacity available for feeder ports in India.15 \n \n18.  By  adopting  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  OSL  will  strengthen  its \nenvironment,  occupational,  health,  safety,  and  social  systems.  OSL  considers  this  a  key \nprerequisite  to  entry  in  the  offshore  and  other  Asian markets,  which  place  a  premium  on \nadherence to best safeguard and safety practices. \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n19.  The proposed assistance to OSL is classified under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009) as general corporate finance. The loan is classified category B for environment as the \nproject\u2019s  potential  environmental  risks  are  not  significant.  OSL\u2019s  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) includes an integrated (safety and quality) management system \n(IMS)  based  on  International  Organization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  9001:2000  and  ISO \n14001:2004 standards, and Occupational Health & Safety Advisory Services (OHSAS) 18001. A \ncorporate audit was conducted on its ESMS and current operations. No major environmental \nissues are associated with the audited facilities and its activities. The audit noted room for \nimprovement  with  respect  to  OSL\u2019s  accident  classification  and  management  system.  OSL \nmanagement has committed to adopt the audit\u2019s recommendations. ADB is satisfied that OSL\u2019s \nESMS is adequate to comply with the Safeguard Policy Statement requirements, and the client \nhas the capacity to manage the environmental risks. \n \n20.  The project is classified category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples \nimpacts since OSL\u2019s operations are not expected to entail involuntary resettlement impacts or \nimpacts on indigenous peoples. OSL services are provided within the boundaries of the port  \nlimits. OSL is provided office space by the port authorities, while crew is accommodated on the \nvessels. The audit confirmed that none of the OSL operations have triggered resettlement to \ndate or have the potential for land acquisition or impacts on indigenous peoples. OSL will submit \nannual reports to ADB on the implementation of its ESMS, including the implementation of \ncorrective actions required by its auditors.  \n \n21.  Other social dimensions. The project is classified as having no gender elements. OSL \nhas  a  human  resources  policy  and  manual,  linked to  the IMS.  The policy  provides  equal \nopportunities to women for positions in the corporate and field offices. The manual includes a \ndocumented grievance redress process that is available to all its employees and workers. OSL \nencourages hiring its crew from the local population. The audit confirms that OSL complies with \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2007.

OSL\u2019s ESMS includes arrangements requiring OSL to comply with \nnational labor laws and to take measures to conform to internationally recognized core labor \nstandards, in compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy.16  \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n22.  OSL was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n23.  The proposed loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n24.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),17 the Government of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the \nproposed  assistance  to  Ocean  Sparkle  Limited.  ADB  will  enter  into  suitable  finance \ndocumentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following approval of the proposed \nassistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n25.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan of up to \n$40,000,000 (to be disbursed in Indian rupees and/or US dollars) to Ocean Sparkle Limited for \nthe Ocean Sparkle Expansion Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with such terms \nand conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may \nbe reported to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n30 September 2014 \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2003.
