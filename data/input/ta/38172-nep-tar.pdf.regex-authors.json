Good governance and strong institutions are central requirements for poverty reduction and \neconomic growth, as recent empirical research has documented.1 Further, research has shown \nconvincingly  that  good  governance  leads  to  higher  economic  growth.  Effective  anticorruption \nmeasures  are  at  the  core  of  good  governance,  as  corruption  erodes  confidence  in  public \ninstitutions, depresses investment, impedes development, and aggravates poverty. \n \n2.  Improving governance and anticorruption practices is especially important for Nepal in its \nquest for development. With per capita income of about $311 per year and poverty incidence of \n38%, Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. In 2006, Nepal was perceived to be the \n125th most corrupt country among the 163 included in the cross-country database compiled by \nTransparency International.2 \n \n3.  The recognition that good governance is important for development has prompted many \nGovernment  and  development  agencies  to  intensify  their  efforts  to  improve  governance, \nparticularly through measures to combat corruption. Strengthening governance is one of the four \npillars3 of development in Nepal\u2019s Tenth Plan. It is also a strategic focus for the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB) assistance in the country, as demonstrated by ADB\u2019s country operations business \nplan 2007\u20132009 for Nepal.4   \n \n4.  This advisory technical assistance (TA) project forms part of ADB\u2019s efforts to assist the \nGovernment  of  Nepal  (the  Government)  in  fighting  corruption  by  enhancing  the  capacity  of \nanticorruption institutions and improving their ability to fulfill their statutory mandates. Recent ADB \nassistance  in  the  governance  area  includes  the  Governance  Reform  Program5 (GRP),  which \nsupported the enactment of three pieces of anticorruption legislation6 and the establishment of the \nNational Vigilance Centre (NVC). In addition, a TA project7 supported the strengthening of the \ntechnical  audit  capacity  of  NVC  to  enable  it  to  undertake  effective  audits  of  government \ninfrastructure projects. This TA effectively complements the work in the GRP, as well as planned \nsupport under the Governance Reforms and Decentralization Cluster Program I. After reviewing \nthe  TA  proposal,8 the  Government  has  concurred  with  the  project  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. Details are in \nAppendix 1.9 \n \n \n                                                 \n1  For  example,  Kauffman,  D.,  A.  Kraay,  and  M.  Mastruzzi.  2005.

ISSUES \n5.  Political  instability  and  violence  have  marred  Nepal\u2019s  recent  history.  The  coalition \nGovernment of the seven-party alliance and the Communist Party of Nepal/Maoist signed an \nhistoric peace accord on 21 November 2006, which ended the violent 11-year insurgency and \nprovided  a  path  toward  lasting  peace  and  sustainable  development  in  Nepal.  An  interim \nGovernment, with the participation of the Communist Party, was formed on 1 April 2007, marking \nanother long-awaited milestone in the peace process. These developments have presented the \ncountry with an historic opportunity to address fundamental problems that have long hindered \neconomic  growth  and  aggravated  poverty.  While  Nepal  has  a  number  of  pressing  priorities, \nimproving governance is central to the country\u2019s development and the sustainable resolution of the \nconflict. Curbing corruption, in all its manifestations, is a particularly urgent issue for the country. \nPublic expectations of how public officials should behave\u2014and how they should address the needs \nof the masses\u2014have risen dramatically. A renewed focus on effectively addressing the corruption \nproblem has accompanied these rising expectations. \n \n6.  Notwithstanding  pervasive  problems  associated  with  corruption,  some  important  reforms \nhave  been  undertaken  recently  in  Nepal  to  fight  corruption.  The  enactment  of  several \nanticorruption laws10 provides new mechanisms for combating corruption. The Government has \nidentified five key institutions11 with the following major functions: \n \n(i)  Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA). The CIAA is a \nconstitutional body that is empowered to investigate and prosecute cases of abuse \nof authority. The CIAA may make recommendations to amend the relevant laws and \nprocedures with a view to preventing future abuse of authority. It also can suggest \nrectifying damage caused by abuse of authority. \n(ii)  Special Court. The CIAA uses the Special Court to prosecute cases of corruption. \nThe  Special  Court  is  legally  authorized  to  effectively  and  swiftly  dispense  with \ncorruption cases that are filed with it. The court also is mandated to consider cases \nof crimes against the state, and to review decisions made by the CIAA. \n(iii)  National Vigilance Centre. NVC, located in the Office of the Prime Minister and \nCouncil of Ministers (OPMCM), plays a preventive role, primarily by monitoring \nasset declarations of government officials. NVC also conducts technical audits of \nprojects and government operations to ensure that service delivery weaknesses in \ngovernment administration are dealt with promptly and effectively.12 \n(iv)  Office of the Auditor General (OAG). OAG is a constitutional body that conducts \nindependent audits and evaluations of public resource use, and seeks to promote \nand uphold public accountability. In particular, OAG assesses whether expenditures \nmade and revenues collected comply with rules and regulations, and whether they \nreflect due regard for efficiency, effectiveness, and propriety. \n                                                 \n10 The primary legal basis of anticorruption work in Nepal is the CIAA Act, 1991. In August 2002, the Prevention of \nCorruption Act, 1961, was repealed and four separate bills were enacted: (i) amendment to the CIAA Act; (ii) revisit of \nthe Prevention of Corruption Act, 1961, by a new act; (iii) an act to establish a Special Court; and (iv) the Impeachment \nAct.  The  Government  of  Nepal  is  also  a  signatory  to  the  ADB-Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and \nDevelopment Anticorruption Initiative and its action plan. \n11 In addition, other relevant agencies whose work impacts anticorruption in Nepal include (i) Revenue Investigation \nDepartment, in the Ministry of Finance, which is tasked with investigating revenue leaks, primarily in customs and \nincome taxes; (ii) National Investigation Department, in the Ministry of Home Affairs, which supports the work of the \nCIAA in investigating cases of corruption; and (iii) Judicial Council, in the Supreme Court, which addresses incidents of \ncorruption in the judiciary. Civil society also has taken a strong interest recently in aggressively ensuring that incidents \nof malpractice and bureaucratic inefficiency at all levels of government are highlighted. \n12 A task force in the OPMCM is reviewing how to improve the alignment of NVC in terms of its functions, roles, and \nmandates. The results of the work of the task force are not public yet. ", "                        3\n   \n(v)  Public Accounts Committee (PAC). PAC is one of the select committees of the \nHouse of Representatives. Its main function is to examine the Public Accounts and \nthe Report of the Auditor General to reduce misuse and abuse of public funds. PAC \nwas reconstituted following the formation of the interim Government on 1 April 2007. \nThe committee is empowered to direct concerned government officials to explain \nfinancial irregularities that might have been specified in the Report of the Auditor \nGeneral. \n \n7.  These  institutions  play  an  important  role  in  curbing  corruption  in  Nepal.  However, \nconsiderable work is required to improve their capacity, professionalism, and outreach. While each \nof  these  institutions  has  capacity  development  requirements,  their  specific  priorities  vary.  In \ngeneral,  however,  the  following  key  needs  tentatively  can  be  identified:13 (i)  capacity  to  (a) \ninvestigate  and  prosecute  significant  cases  of  corruption,  (b)  audit  projects  and  government \nactivities at the local level, (c) rigorously review government operations and audited statements, \nand (d) swiftly and effectively dispense with corruption cases filed for prosecution; (ii) exposure to \nhow anticorruption institutions in other jurisdictions operate, and what lessons can be learned and \napplied in Nepal; and (iii) public awareness of (a) the work of the anticorruption institutions to \nenhance transparency and project a coherent message on anticorruption, and (b) how people can \nhelp  in  identifying  instances  of  corruption  and  malpractice  that  then  can  be  investigated \nappropriately. \n \n8.  Other common problems facing these institutions include the lack of awareness and limited \noutreach beyond Kathmandu. The work of anticorruption institutions can be effective only if the \npublic actively supports it. Lack of awareness of the functions by the public limits their reach, as \nwell as impedes the necessary information flow on corruption to these institutions. Therefore, \nexpanding anticorruption activities beyond Kathmandu is vital, and establishing links with civil \nsociety is particularly important in this regard.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will support the Government\u2019s initiatives in strengthening the institutional capacity of \nanticorruption institutions, thereby improving their ability to fulfill their statutory mandates. The \nintended  impact  is  the  enhancement  of  good  governance  through  stronger  action  against \ncorruption in the public sector, as well as greater accountability and transparency in government \noperations  and  service  delivery.  The  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  reduce  corruption  and  improve \ngovernance  in  Nepal,  thereby  contributing  to  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  better \ndevelopment outcomes in the country. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  By promoting good governance, this TA contributes to the implementation of one of ADB\u2019s \nstrategic areas of focus in Nepal. It also plays an important part in supporting the design and \nimplementation  of  the  Governance  Reforms  and  Decentralization  Cluster  Program  (GRDCP), \nwhich will be processed in 2008. Anticorruption will be featured strongly in the GRDCP. The \ncapacity enhancement of the institutions will enable more effective implementation measures by \nthese institutions under the GRDCP. An anticorruption institution will qualify for support under this \nTA if it (i) is part of the larger government agenda on good governance; and (ii) takes a holistic \n                                                 \n13 Discussions were held with all five anticorruption institutions about their mandates, institutional and legal frameworks, \noperating environments, and key current gaps in fulfilling mandates. \n ", "4     \n \n \napproach to fighting corruption (i.e., cuts across institutions\u2014in the executive, legislative, and \njudiciary branches\u2014at the center of government, focuses on outreach outside Kathmandu, and \nenhances public awareness). \n \n11.  The TA was designed after consultation with all the major anticorruption institutions in Nepal. \nIn addition, it has analyzed all the capacity development needs of the institutions and identified \npriorities that promise to yield the best outcomes. The validity of this approach also is supported by \nlessons drawn from ADB\u2019s past technical assistance work in Nepal, which indicate that a TA is \nmost effective when it adequately considers the links of related institutions in carrying out certain \nfunctions. \n \n12.  The TA will have three parts: (i) part A entails a needs assessments for different institutions \nto ascertain how best to carry out capacity development, (ii) part B involves capacity development \nin key areas to help the institutions fulfill their statutory mandates better, and (iii) part C covers the \ndissemination and public awareness campaign of the work of these institutions.  \n \n13.  Part A: Needs Assessment. To ensure that limited resources are used most efficiently, \ncareful needs assessments will be carried out in the five institutions. The needs assessments are \nimportant because, while all the institutions identified broad areas for capacity development, they \nhave been unable to pinpoint specific areas and ways to improve capacity. As such, all of them \nconsider  the  needs  assessments  the  necessary  starting  point.  The  assessments  will  include \ncarefully evaluating capacity, identifying gaps, and recommending the best measures to address \nthe  gaps.  The  five  institutions,  with  support  from  the  TA  consultants,  will  lead  the  capacity \nassessment process.  \n \n14.  Part  B:  Capacity  Development  for  the  Anticorruption  Institutions.  The  capacity \ndevelopment areas for different institutions will target their specific needs. Based on the needs \nassessments, the TA then will prioritize them through a consultative process and determine ways \nto strengthen systems of operations, greater expertise among staff, and organizational capability. \nThis capacity development support is expected to cover (i) equipment and technology, as well as \nother  support,  including  costs  for  computers  and  printers,  network  connections,  online \nsubscriptions to journals, etc., database management software, and library support (such as for \nbooks and journals); (ii) study visits to neighboring countries to assess how relevant practices are \nmanaged in these jurisdictions; and (iii) on-the-job training in OAG and PAC to enable staff in these \ninstitutions to better fulfill their roles of determining the extent of administrative and financial \nirregularities in government operations, which serve as inputs to the work of other anticorruption \ninstitutions. \n \n15.  Part C: Dissemination and Public Awareness Campaign. The anticorruption institutions \ncan be effective only when the public supports and utilizes them. Assistance in this area will \ninclude ensuring that the relevant institutions can disseminate widely to the public their work in \neradicating corruption, as well as addressing how the public might be able to help in this endeavor. \nWorking with the institutions, the TA will produce well-designed public awareness materials and \npublic awareness activities. It is particularly important to carry out the public awareness in a \ncomprehensive,  concerted,  and  coordinated  manner  that  covers  all  the  major  anticorruption \ninstitutions. Further, the campaign should be undertaken in conjunction with pertinent civil society \norganizations, as well as development partners. This will reduce costs and ensure the best use of \nresources through economies of scale, while also ensuring that clear and coherent messages are \ndisseminated to the public.   \n ", "                        5\n   \n16.  TA activities will include preparing workshop materials, publishing pamphlets, carrying out \nopinion  surveys,  interacting  with  civil  society  groups,  preparing  short  video  clips  that  can  be \nbroadcast nationally, and supporting the establishment and/or upgrading of institutional Web sites. \nThe institutions and nongovernment organizations will hold workshops to expand public awareness \nof anticorruption activities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $475,000, of which ADB will finance $400,000 on a grant basis \nfrom its TA funding program. The Government will provide the equivalent of $75,000 to finance part \nof the local currency costs for counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative support, etc. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Given its mandate to play a coordinating role for the whole government, OPMCM will serve \nas the Executing Agency for the Project. A senior official of OPMCM (at least the rank of joint \nsecretary) will be designated as the project director. The implementing agencies will be CIAA, \nNVC, OAG, PAC, and Special Court. A steering committee, to be chaired by the chief secretary, \nwill be established and will have representatives of CIAA; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Home \nAffairs; Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary Affairs; NVC; OAG; PAC; and the Special \nCourt. The steering committee may invite other parties (such as nongovernment organizations) to \nattend its meetings, if necessary to achieve specific TA objectives. The committee, which will meet \nat least once every 3 months, will be mandated to (i) monitor and guide the implementation of the \nProject, (ii) resolve issues that might arise in its execution and implementation, and (iii) review TA \nconsultants\u2019 reports. A TA monitoring unit will be established at the Nepal Resident Mission to \nfollow up regularly on project progress. \n \n19.  Consulting services required for the TA include (i) 12 person-months from an anticorruption \nexpert, who also will serve as full-time team leader; (ii) 9 person-months, intermittent, from two \nauditing and government finance specialists (one to be based at OAG for 6  months, the other at \nPAC for 3 months); (iii) 6 person-months, intermittent, from a public awareness campaign specialist; \n(iv)  2  person-months,  intermittent,  from  a  needs  assessment  specialist  on  institutional  and/or \norganizational  development;  and  (v)  1  person-month,  intermittent,  from  a  needs  assessment \nspecialist on judicial matters. A national consulting firm, which will be selected using the quality \nbased selection method, will provide all consulting services. The consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3, and a work plan for the \nactivities of the TA is in Table A3.   \n \n20.  Equipment will be procured using the shopping method, and will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, all equipment \nwill be retained by the agencies that are using them. The TA is expected to be implemented over \n12 months, from September 2007 to August 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the provision \nof  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  the \nGovernment of Nepal for Support to Anticorruption Institutions, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhancement of good  \u2022  Improved public  \u2022  International and domestic  \u2022  Strong government \ngovernance through  perception and  public perception surveys  commitment to promote \nstronger action against  improved ranking in  \u2022  Annual reports of  good governance \ncorruption, and greater  cross-country  anticorruption institutions  \u2022  Commitment from the \naccountability and  corruption surveys  \u2022  Regular reports and/or  leadership of the \ntransparency in the public  \u2022  Better public service  surveys of NGOs and civil  anticorruption institutions to \nsector  delivery as measured  society groups involved in  enhance capacity and \n  by reductions in  anticorruption work  improve performance \ncomplaints from  \u2022  Business climate surveys    \nservice users  \u2022  ADB evaluation missions  Risks \n\u2022  Improved business    \u2022  Faltered government \nclimate as reflected in     commitment in combating \ngreater levels of  corruption \ninvestments  \u2022  Ineffective resource use, or \n  inability to make use of \nresources, by agencies \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStronger anticorruption  \u2022  Reduction in time  \u2022  Annual reports of  \u2022  Anticorruption institutions try \ninstitutions whose work is  taken to effectively  anticorruption institutions  to absorb and apply the \ncoordinated better, and  audit projects and  \u2022  Regular review by ADB  capacity development \nwhich are more able to  conduct technical  and the steering  outcome \nfulfill their statutory  audits  committee  \u2022  The Government sees \nmandates  \u2022  Reduction in time  \u2022  Feedback from the public  anticorruption policies and \n  taken to effectively  to anticorruption  strategies through to \n  dispense with  institutions on incidence of  completion \ncorruption cases  corruption  \u2022  Regular ADB review \n\u2022  Increased awareness  \u2022  Feedback from   \nof, and reliance on, the  anticorruption institutions  Risk \nwork of anticorruption  \u2022  Steering committee  \u2022  Ineffective resource use, or \ninstitutions by the  meeting minutes  inability to make use of \npublic  \u2022  Reports from civil society  resources, by agencies \n\u2022  Wider outreach of  groups and NGOs \nanticorruption   \ninstitutions beyond   \nKathmandu and urban \ncenters \n\u2022  Less duplication in the \nwork of the \nanticorruption \ninstitutions \n\u2022  Better links between \nanticorruption \ninstitutions and civil \nsociety, as measured \nby the effectiveness of \npartnership \nagreements \n ", "Appendix 1 7\n   \n     \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
