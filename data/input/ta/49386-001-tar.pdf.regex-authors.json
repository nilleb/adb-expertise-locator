INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2015, the Government of the Philippines requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to enhance financial inclusion to address poverty and \nstrengthen micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The project team consulted the Bangko \nSentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and other concerned government agencies in preparing the TA. The \nTA aims to identify, through consultations and a survey, sector-wide binding constraints to \nformulate effective assistance and support government efforts to expand financial inclusion by \nstrengthening  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  to  promote  financial  services  for  the \nunserved and underserved population. The TA was first included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan, 2016\u20132018 for the Philippines1. It is in line with the Country Partnership Strategy, \n2011-2016, and the government\u2019s Philippine Development Plan, 2011\u20132016, which identifies a \n\u201cresilient and inclusive\u201d financial system as the development goal of the financial sector. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Access to financial products and services is critical for all individuals and businesses. It \nhelps smoothen their cash flow, facilitates their investments, expands their economic activities, \nand protects their assets. Greater financial inclusion supports financial stability and economic \ndevelopment.  It  is  also  an  effective  means  to  achieve  inclusive  growth.  However,  limited \nfinancial inclusion can cause persistent income inequality and constrain economic growth. \n \n3.  Despite  the  impressive  growth  of  microfinance  and  a  recognized  development \nframework for inclusive finance globally, financial inclusion in the Philippines still remains low. \nOnly 31.3% of adults held an account at a formal financial institution in 2015. Lower-income \npopulations are financially excluded, with only 17.8% of adults in the bottom 40.0% of income \nearners  holding  an  account  at  a  formal  financial  institution.  There  are  significant  regional \ndisparities in financial access. As of December 2014, 36% of municipalities do not have a \nbanking office according to the government. While these areas are partially covered by nonbank \nfinancial institutions (such as microfinance nongovernment organizations [NGOs], cooperatives, \npawnshops, and remittance agents), people and businesses do not always have access to a full \nrange of financial services, including savings, credit, and insurance. Expanding these financial \nservices  nationwide  is  critical  to  meet  the  multidimensional  finance  needs  of  individuals, \nhouseholds, and businesses. \n \n4.  To holistically promote financial inclusion in line with the G20 Principles for Innovative \nFinancial Inclusion outlined in the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion framework,3 the \ngovernment launched the National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (NSFI) on 1 July 2015 to \ncoordinate broad-based initiatives for greater financial inclusion among stakeholders, including \n13  government  agencies,  private  sector  institutions,  and  development  partners.  The  BSP \nhouses the secretariat for the NSFI, and monitors and coordinates the strategy\u2019s implementation. \nThe NSFI defines financial inclusion as \u201ca state wherein there is effective access to a wide \nrange of financial products and services by all.\u201d4 To achieve this goal, the BSP has mapped \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2015.

The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 June 2016.

Manila. p.2.  \n ", "2 \nactivities initiated by the concerned government agencies and set up a monitoring framework. \nBased  on  these  activities,  a  broad  range  of  stakeholders  and  partners  will  formulate  and \nimplement action plans to exert a concerted effort to expand financial inclusion. The national \nfinancial  inclusion  framework  established  under  the  NSFI  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \nsustained to comprehensively monitor and evaluate the progress of a wide range of initiatives \nunder the strategy. \n \n5.  ADB has supported financial inclusion initiatives for the Philippines since 1988. ADB's \nRural Microenterprise Finance Project,5 implemented from 1996 to 2002, laid the foundation for \nsuccessful microfinance wholesale lending operations, strengthening microfinance operating \nentities and their reach from less than half a million clients in the late 1990s to about 7 million \nactive clients. ADB's Microfinance Development Program,6 implemented from 2005 to 2007, \nstrengthened  the  microfinance  policy  environment,  improved  regulatory  and  operational \ncapacities, and promoted financial literacy. Associated grants and TA helped further improve the \nregulatory  environment  for  credit  and  savings  cooperatives,  and  develop  an  appropriate \nregulatory environment for microinsurance.7  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  impact  will  be  greater  financial  inclusion.  The  outcome  will  be  strengthened \ninstitutional capacity of national financial inclusion initiatives. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA will identify sector-wide binding constraints, through consultations and a survey, \nto formulate effective assistance and support the implementation of the NSFI by strengthening \nthe policy and regulatory framework to promote savings, credit, microinsurance, and digital \nfinance. It will provide inputs to the formulation of the ensuing loan that will address emerging \nand remaining sector development issues identified through the course of TA implementation. \nThe TA scope includes (i) assessing the financial inclusion framework to identify sector-wide \nchallenges  to  effective  assistance,  (ii)  promoting  savings  and  credit  through  policy  and \nregulatory  improvement,  (iii)  developing  diverse  microinsurance  products  and  services  by \nimproving the regulatory framework, and (iv) promoting digital finance by enhancing regulatory \nand supervisory capacity. The TA is also a follow-on project to the capacity development TA for \nmicroinsurance (footnote 7) and will cover a wider range of development initiatives for greater \nfinancial inclusion, especially among low-income households, to supplement social insurance \ninitiatives. The TA will have four outputs. \n \n8.  Output  1:  Financial  inclusion  framework  assessed  to  formulate  effective \nassistance. The TA will conduct a diagnostic study of the financial inclusion framework through \nconsultations  and  a  survey  to  identify  sector-wide  binding  constraints  to  deeper  financial \ninclusion. The TA survey will complement the National Baseline Survey on Financial Inclusion,8 \n                                                \n5  ADB. 1996.

The terms of reference for the survey are in Appendix 3. The findings of \nthe diagnostic study and survey will help formulate the government\u2019s action plan under the NSFI \nand an ADB policy-based loan scheduled for processing in 2018.9 The diagnostic study will be \nshared and discussed at stakeholders\u2019 consultative meetings and will be continuously updated \nwith emerging and important issues identified during TA implementation. \n9.  Output  2:  Policy  and regulatory  framework improved to  promote savings  and \ncredit. Access to credit can be improved by strengthening the institutional capacity to provide \ninclusive financial services and promoting new financial products suitable for various business \nmodels. Following the enactment of the Microfinance NGOs Act in late 2015, the TA will help set \nup an appropriate regulatory framework for microfinance NGOs to conduct sound grassroots \nfinancial operations for low-income populations and protect them as financial customers. The \nnew law will establish the Microfinance NGO Regulatory Council, which will be headed by the \nchairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as the regulatory body for \nmicrofinance NGOs. The TA will help SEC and the council (i) improve the implementing rules \nand  regulations  of  the  Microfinance  NGOs  Act;  (ii)  disseminate  the  rules  and  regulations;  \n(iii)  formulate  accreditation,  performance  and  social  standards  for  microfinance  NGOs;  \n(iv) design an effective monitoring system and supervisory procedures; (v) through TA training, \nstrengthen microfinance NGOs\u2019 regulatory and compliance capacity to provide safe, accessible, \nand responsible financial services; and (vi) determine the optimum organizational structure of \nthe council for its efficient and effective regulations. \n \n10.  The TA will promote the value chain finance approach to meet the growing needs for \ntimely  and  sufficient  financing  to  critical  phases  of  value  chains,  including  procurement, \nmanufacturing, processing, and shipping for private businesses. With the lack of hard collateral \nand weak financial conditions, most micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises are ineligible \nfor formal finance and cannot achieve their potential. There is also very little knowledge or \nawareness of risk management techniques and price volatility control. Risk mitigation products, \nsuch as insurance, loan guarantees, and options, could be used to offset some of the risk in \nvalue chains. The tightening of prudential norms under the Basel Accords exacerbates the \nfinancial exclusion of small borrowers. However, there are examples of successful development \nof value chain finance in the food business segment. These can be replicated in other industries \nwith improved access to finance by relying on the strength of the value chain rather than on \nhard  collateral  such  as  property.  Moreover,  the  BSP  has  been  supportive  of  alternative \ncollateral-based finance, and, in March 2016, issued a circular to promote agriculture value \nchain finance.10 The TA will help the BSP promote value chain finance through regulatory \nincentives, awareness raising, and capacity development in database formulation, performance \nmonitoring, risk management, and governance compliance. The TA will link with an ADB supply \nchain finance program to support innovation in financing small-scale businesses by showcasing \nand catalyzing successful value chain financing deals.11  \n11.  The TA will also promote financial technology by using alternative sources of data for \ncredit scoring to reduce credit management costs and risks. Collaboration with other initiatives \nof development partners will be sought, including the movable collateral registry and the credit \ninformation bureau projects supported by the International Finance Corporation. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2015.

To increase savings mobilization, the BSP has been (i) promoting micro-deposits as an \nexpanded  microfinance  product  by  defining  the  average  daily  balance  threshold  (currently \n\u20b140,000) for micro-deposits, (ii) simplifying procedures to open accounts, and (iii) allowing \nbanks to open micro-banking offices to reach unserved and underserved areas. The TA will \nfurther support BSP efforts by designing options to link micro-deposit accounts to cash cards \nthrough which conditional cash transfers are disbursed. To promote savings, it will also facilitate \nelectronic money transfers to and from deposit accounts. The TA activities will be coordinated \nand collaborated with conditional cash transfer support by ADB and World Bank and ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector operations for electronic banking promotion. \n13.  Output  3:  Microinsurance  regulatory  framework  improved  to  develop  diverse \nmicroinsurance  products  and  services. The majority of people who are working in low-\nincome and informal sectors live in rural areas and depend on agriculture-based activities for \ntheir income and livelihood. The agriculture sector is highly vulnerable to increasingly intense \nweather-related events, particularly typhoons and floods, because of climate change. Providing \nproper  risk  protection  to  the  agriculture  sector  is  essential  for  promoting  greater  financial \ninclusion. The TA will support the implementation of an Insurance Commission circular letter12 \nissued on 15 October 2015 to help the National Credit Council (NCC) under the Department of \nFinance and the Insurance Commission create an enabling regulatory environment and promote \nthe development of commercial insurance products for the agriculture sector under public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  arrangements.13 The  scope  also  includes  product  bundling  to  increase \nproduct  coverage  with  active  roles  of  agents  and  brokers,  and  possible  reinsurance \narrangements for microinsurance to increase sustainability and resilience to natural calamities. \nThis component will use the implementation framework developed under previous and ongoing \ngrant and TA projects (footnote 6), working with the NCC, the Insurance Commission, and the \nTechnical Working  Group  for  Agriculture/Parametric  Microinsurance  Framework  established \nunder the Insurance Commission circular letter (footnote 12). \n14.  Output  4:  Regulatory  and  supervisory  capacity  enhanced  to  promote  digital \nfinance. The TA will support the BSP in developing a more inclusive payment system by \napplying digital technology to help financial service providers extend their outreach to the most \nexcluded populations. The TA will also explore the use of existing electronic payment channels \nto expand access to finance, and digital platforms to tailor products and services for the hardest-\nto-reach clients. The ongoing BSP initiative to develop a national retail payment system seeks \nto  establish  a  unified  electronic  payment  system  to  promote  safe,  efficient,  inclusive,  and \nreliable retail payments. The successful implementation of the national retail payment system \nwill  increase  the  volume  and  value  of  e-payment  transactions  and  also  open  up  more \nopportunities to scale up access to finance. The TA will enhance the regulatory and supervisory \ncapacity to promote the use of digital financial services as a means to increase the overall scale \nof and people\u2019s access to financial services in the Philippines.14 \n \n15.  Risks. Weakened Government\u2019s commitment and concerted efforts to deepen financial \ninclusion are considered as the main risk. However, the formulation and implementation of NSFI \nconfirms that the risk is minimized. \n                                                \n12 Government of the Philippines, Department of Finance, Insurance Commission. 2015.

Manila, \nwhich will carry out a regulatory diagnostic study of digital finance in Asian countries, including the Philippines, in \n2016. \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $720,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, office supplies, secretarial \nassistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The BSP is the executing agency. It became one of the first central banks in the world to \nestablish  an  office  dedicated  to  financial  inclusion  when  it  created  the  Inclusive  Finance \nAdvocacy Staff (IFAS) in 2007. Through the successful implementation of financial inclusion \ninitiatives in collaboration with development partners (including ADB, the Alliance for Financial \nInclusion, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, the International Finance Corporation, and \nthe World Bank), IFAS\u2019 institutional, organizational, procurement, and financial management \ncapacities have been proven satisfactory. The BSP, SEC, NCC, and the Insurance Commission \nare the implementing agencies. The BSP will establish a steering committee to provide overall \ndirection for and coordination of the TA activities. The BSP deputy governor will chair the \nsteering committee, composed of officials representing the implementing agencies. The BSP, \nthrough IFAS, will also establish a project management unit to provide technical support to the \nsteering committee and oversee the TA activities of implementing agencies, undertaking project \nadministration, and project reporting and communication with ADB. The implementing agencies \nwill be responsible for their project reporting and will discuss implementing issues with the BSP, \nas  necessary.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months  and  is  expected  to  start  on  \n1 November 2016 and end on 31 October 2018. \n \n18.  The TA will provide 14 person-months of international and 21 person-months of national \nconsultant  services:  (i)  an  international  inclusive  finance  development  specialist  and  team \nleader, 8 person-months; (ii) an international inclusive finance specialist, 6 person-months; (iii) a \nnational microinsurance specialist, 6 person-months; (iv) a national digital finance specialist, 6 \nperson-months; and (v) a national project management specialist, 9 person-months. ADB will \nalso engage a national research institute to carry out a household survey in two or three cities. \nAll consultants will work on an intermittent basis. ADB will engage the consultants individually \nfollowing its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The \nindividual selection can provide a better mix of the skills required by the TA while maximizing \nthe  TA  resources  with  no  management  fees  charged.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. A research institute for the TA survey (para. 7) can be selected \nthrough  single-source  selection  when  only  one  firm  is  qualified  for  the  assignment. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Office equipment for the TA \nproject administration will be procured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, \nas amended from time to time). Upon TA completion, all equipment purchased under the TA will \nbe handed over to the executing agency in accordance with ADB's normal practice. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Financial Inclusion Framework Strengthening, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nGreater financial inclusion approach (National Strategy for Financial Inclusion) a \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By 2019     \nInstitutional capacity  The action plan under the  BSP project reports and  Macroeconomic \nof national financial  National Strategy for  website  instability erodes the \ninclusion initiatives  Financial Inclusion  momentum for \nstrengthened  implemented   deepening national \n(2015 baseline: 0)  financial inclusion. \n \nSystemic risk, \nespecially outside \nbanking supervision, \ncauses runs on \nfinancial institutions. \nOutputs       \n1.
