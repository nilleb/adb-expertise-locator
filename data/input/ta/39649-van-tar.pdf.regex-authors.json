Vanuatu is a young and growing country, with most of the population under the age of 30. \nWhile Vanuatu\u2019s population has increased rapidly over the past decade, average annual growth in \ngross domestic product per capita has been primarily negative, turning positive only in the past few \nyears. As a result, Vanuatu is the third poorest country in the Pacific region. With a human poverty \nindex of 24.7, Vanuatu is ranked 52nd in the world.1 A looming issue is the large portion of the \npopulation comprising youth about to enter the workforce\u201442% of the population is 14 years old or \nyounger.2 Jobs are being created far more slowly than the current and future inflow of young \nworkers.3 Further, the Government is not meeting the full costs of providing schooling and other \npublic services for children. The Institute of Statistics of the United Nations Educational, Scientific \nand Cultural Organization found that only 9.6% of gross domestic product was devoted to public \neducation  in  2004.  The  repetition  rate  for  primary  education  is  high  by  regional  standards, \naccounting for 9% of enrollment, and the dropout and attrition rate is also high.4 Consequently, \npoorly  prepared  and  trained  youth  are  entering  a  tight  job  market,  which  offers  them  few \nopportunities to earn a living. Vanuatu does not have much time to address these issues, as some \nestimates indicate that four persons enter the job market for every job created.5 Therefore, rapid \naction is imperative to resolve many of the bottlenecks to job creation and growth. On the positive \nside, Vanuatu has substantial long-term prospects for growth and development. In addition to \nsignificant agricultural prospects, the country\u2019s natural beauty offers tourism potential.  \n \n2.  Many of the building block institutions required for sustained economic development are \ndeveloping, albeit slowly. The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) strategy for Vanuatu addresses \nfundamental  constraints  to  sustainable,  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  Specifically,  the \nstrategy supports the development of an enabling environment for private sector development, \nfocusing on strengthening the policy, institutional, and regulatory framework for business; and \nincreasing access to finance. Developing and implementing a coherent policy towards the private \nsector is difficult. At a minimum, the Government has a central role in identifying and reducing \nbarriers to private sector development. Consistent with the Government\u2019s Priorities and Action \nAgenda (PAA),6 the aim of ADB\u2019s strategy is to (i) encourage economic growth, which has not kept \npace  with  population  growth;  (ii)  address  low  private  sector  investment;  and  (iii)  reduce \nunemployment.   \n \n3.  This technical assistance (TA) will seek to update the laws that are the foundation of \ncommercial transactions, while supporting the capacity of Government to implement and monitor \ncompliance  with  these  laws.  The  TA7  addresses  the  broad  development  priorities  of  the \nGovernment, and specifically the Vanuatu Financial Services Commission (VFSC). It is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009, and was included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \nupdate (footnote 1). The Government concurs with the TA's objectives, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB).  2006. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132009) Vanuatu.

The  new  PAA\u2019s  strategic  priorities  are  consistent  with  those  in  the  previous  PAA  and \nComprehensive Reform Program. \n7  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 June 2006. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Low levels of private investment are indicative of the challenges Vanuatu is facing in trying \nto achieve the economic growth required to provide income-earning opportunities for its population. \nThe inherited legal and regulatory framework for business transactions is outdated. As such, it is \nineffective  in  supporting  the  type  of  modern  business  transactions  that  would  help  establish \nVanuatu as an internationally reputable and commercially attractive financial center. Following an \nInternational Monetary Fund assessment,8 a process of reforming the legal, institutional and policy \nframework for the offshore sector is underway. However, much more is needed to establish a \ncredible financial and business framework in Vanuatu.  \n5.  Some  diagnostic  studies  and  assessments  have  suggested  that  the  legal  business \nframework does not support efficient business activity adequately, and have stressed the need for \nsubstantial reform.9 Vanuatu\u2019s local laws, which have been carried over from the Republic\u2019s days \nas a condominium,10 contain elements of British Common Law and the French Napoleonic Code. A \nnumber of impediments have been identified in the Companies Act, which was modeled after the \n1948 and 1967 British Companies Act. The act (i) lacks an express standard of care that forces the \ndirectors  or officers of  a company  to act in the best interest of the company or its shareholders; \n(ii) inadequately protects minority shareholder rights; (iii) lacks an efficient system for settling \ndisputes between the main stakeholders in a company (shareholders, directors, and management); \nand  (iv)  is  superseded  or  conflicts  with  the  many  laws  in  the  financial  sector.  Indeed,  the \nCompanies Act, in conjunction with the Vanuatu Banking, Insurance, Stamp Duties, and Trust \nCompanies Regulations, form the statutory framework for the operation of the finance sector. \nVFSC administers this framework, which is interpreted by the Supreme Court of Vanuatu. \n6.  The bankruptcy and insolvency framework11 effectively is nonexistent, which increases risks \nfor  operating  businesses.  In  the  absence  of  a  specific  Vanuatu  bankruptcy  law,  the  1914 \nBankruptcy Act of United Kingdom is used as a guideline for insolvencies. This results in an \ninefficient system for dealing with corporate liquidations or restructurings. Thus, ways of facilitating \nbusiness rehabilitation urgently need to be found. The new bankruptcy and insolvency law should \nestablish an efficient institutional setup for dealing with insolvency proceedings. Further, it should \nassist the Government in promoting investor confidence in the marketplace by providing a fair and \neffective system for restoring assets to productive use, including establishing a framework for \ndebtor rehabilitation, a deterrent to fraud, and a public record of estates. \n7.  The companies\u2019 registry costs can be high for small- and medium-scale businesses. The \nlaw requires a broad range of relatively expensive licenses and registrations, as well as regulatory \nrequirements  (e.g.,  preparation  of  a  60\u201370  page  memorandum  and  articles  of  association  is \nrequired before company registration). Further, the finance minister and attorney general must \napprove each incorporation. While these layers of bureaucracy have no compensating public policy \nobjective, they increase uncertainty and transaction costs for investors. Notarization costs also are \nhigh, and notaries are granted the power to make rules prescribing their fees.  \n                                                 \n8  Assessment reports: IMF. 2003.

Washington, DC. \n10 Vanuatu achieved independence in July 1980.  \n11 The bankruptcy framework covers laws and regulations applicable to individuals and partnerships. Companies and \nother corporations enter into differently named legal insolvency procedures. The term \u201cbankruptcy\u201d is often used \nincorrectly in the media and in general conversation when referring to companies. \n \n ", "  3\n8.  In December 1993, VFSC was established to regulate and supervise the non-banking \nfinancial services industry in accordance with Government legislation and international standards. \nAs a result, Vanuatu was recognized as having an internationally reputable and commercially \nattractive finance center. Among its duties, VFSC (i) supervises financial business to protect the \npublic against financial  losses arising from financial dishonesty, incompetence, and malpractice; \n(ii) generally administers the collection of fees, charges, and other revenues due under the acts; \n(iii)  acts  internationally  as  the  national  authority  on  matters  relating  to  the  supervision  and \nregulation  of  financial business;  and  (iv)  provides  advice  and  assistance  to  the  Government, \nparticularly  on  the  preparation  and  submission  of  reports,  and  makes  recommendations  on \nfinancial business. As a priority of its corporate plan, VFSC has started modernizing its institutional \nand  legal  framework,  making  notable  progress  in  recent  years.  With  the  passage  of  the \nInternational Banking Act in 2002, VFSC transferred banking supervision responsibilities to the \nReserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV).12 In 2005, Parliament passed the new Insurance Act, Protected \nCell  Companies  Act,  Mutual  Funds  Act,  and  Unit  Trust  Funds  Act.  VFSC  is  revising  the \nInternational Companies Act, and has initiated the drafting of a new trust law and companies \nservices  providers  bill.  With  the  upgrading  of  the  legal framework  underway,  VFSC  must  be \ncapable  of  carrying  out  its  responsibilities  for  overseeing  the  new  legislation.  Its  supervision \ncapacity needs to be improved to ensure greater compliance with laws and regulations. Further, \ndecision making needs to be more open and transparent, and the governance structure of the \nboard must be examined to ensure that VFSC performs at a high level and has the ability to act \nefficiently and effectively. Information technology also needs to be updated to ensure that VFSC \nprovides accurate and timely services, which will enhance the reputation of Vanuatu as a center of \nfinancial business. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  This  TA  will  assist  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  framework  for  business \ntransactions, thereby improving the reputation and commercial attractiveness of Vanuatu as an \ninvestment destination that supports international standards and good practice. Specifically, the TA \nwill (i) reform the laws and regulations constituting the companies, bankruptcy, and insolvency \nframework; (ii) develop companies\u2019 registry reform road map; and (iii) conduct an assessment of \nVFSC to ensure high corporate governance standards and strong supervisory capabilities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  Reforming business law will be guided by the following principles:  \n(i)  Focus. The legal framework should make setting up, running, and closing a business \nas easy as possible.  \n(ii)  Local detail. The legislation should take into account that most Vanuatu businesses \nare small, and that business transactions often involve rural enterprises.  \n(iii)  Simplicity. The legislation should be unambiguous in language, cost-effective, and \neasily understood. \n(iv)  Capacity. The legal and supporting institutional design should take into account the \nrelatively low level of local capacity. \n                                                 \n12 Before 1999, VFSC and RBV divided the supervisory responsibilities for Vanuatu\u2019s financial institutions. However, \nunder the Financial Institutions Act of 1999, RBV was granted exclusive supervisory responsibility for domestic banks. \nIn addition, under the International Banking Act of 2002, RBV\u2019s responsibility was extended to offshore banks. In 2003, \nVanuatu National Provident Fund also fell under the supervision of RBV.  \n ", "4   \n(v)  Consultation. In support of the reform process, extensive consultations should be \nundertaken  with  various  stakeholders,  including  the  judiciary,  business  groups, \naccounting and business advisory services, legal practitioners, and the general public. \nThe aim is to help improve understanding and build ownership of the reform process, \nand to enhance awareness of the legal reforms and their implications for business. The \nTA  will  ensure  that  critical  links  with  the  ongoing  Secured  Transactions  Reforms13 \nprocess are established.  \n11.  The TA will generate the following outputs: (i) draft companies act; (ii) draft bankruptcy and \ninsolvency act; (iii) companies\u2019 registry reform road map; and (iv) diagnostic report analyzing the \npolicy mandate, as well as the institutional and legal framework, for VFSC and the accompanying \naction plan, including the sequencing and costing of reforms needed for VFSC to fulfill its mandate. \nThe TA will have four components. \n \n12.   Part A, support for company act reform, will entail \n \n(i)  a diagnostic study of laws and regulations relating to companies in Vanuatu;  \n(ii)  identification through a participatory process of the reforms required in the legal \nframework  for  supervising  companies  and  enhancing  corporate  governance  of \nVanuatu, taking into account regional and international good practices; \n(iii)  formulation of a white paper on reform of the Companies Act; and \n(iv)  drafting of new act, and recommendations for setting up this act, based on the \nreforms  identified  to  enhance  corporate  governance  and  achieve  consistency \nbetween the company act and other laws, the proposed bankruptcy and insolvency \nact, and the laws governing different financial organizations. \n \n13.   Part B, support for bankruptcy and insolvency act reform, will entail \n  \n(i)  a diagnostic review of laws and regulations relating to bankruptcy and insolvency of \ncompanies in Vanuatu;  \n(ii)  identification through a participatory process of the reforms required in the legal \nframework  for  bankruptcy  and  insolvency,  taking  into  account  regional  and \ninternational practices; \n(iii)  formulation of a white paper on draft of  the proposed bankruptcy and insolvency \nact; and \n(iv)  drafting of new act to enact the reforms, and recommendations for setting up the \nact. \n \n14.  Part C, companies\u2019 registry reform road map, will entail  \n(i)  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  business  processes  of  the  companies\u2019  registry, \nincluding strategy, organization, structure, segments, and reporting arrangements; \n(ii)  drafting of new companies\u2019 registry road map; and \n(iii)  recommendations and detailed guidelines for implementing reform with respect to \nlodging, processing, and storing business registration information; and making it \navailable to relevant users in the private and public sectors based on international \ngood practice.  \n \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Vanuatu for the Secured Transactions Reforms (Cofinanced by \nthe Government of Australia). Manila (TA 4457-VAN, approved on 2 December, for $800,000). No other substantial \nfinancial sector reforms are ongoing. \n ", "  5\n15.  Part D, capacity building and strengthening of VFSC, will entail \n \n(i)  an analysis of the availability and allocation of VFSC resources and staff capacity to \nimplement their regulatory mandate;  \n(ii)  a diagnostic study and provision of guidelines for developing VFSC\u2019s (a) systems, \nprocedures,  and  capacity  for  market  monitoring  and  surveillance;  (b)  reporting \nrequirements and systems to assist in tracking market participants\u2019 compliance with \nVFSC rules and regulations; and (c) enforcement and prosecution mechanisms to \nensure the effectiveness of the regulations; \n(iii)  preparation of an action plan for sequencing and costing reforms for discussion to \nenable VFSC to fulfill its mandate; and \n(iv)  development of training programs and workshops for VFSC officials to enable VFSC \nto enforce effectively regulations and other prescribed international best practices, \nand surveillance and monitoring systems for all participants. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB to \nfinance the equivalent of $800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB's TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to \n$200,000,  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff  salaries,  office  accommodation  and \ntransportation, support services, and the facilitation of consultations. Detailed cost estimates and \nthe financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2007 to December 2008. The \nfocused reforms to be envisaged in the TA are under VFSC's responsibility. Since VFSC has \nadministrative authority within the Government for all TA components, it will be the Executing \nAgency. VFSC will provide office space for consultants and assign a senior counterpart staff \nmember to lead the operational aspects of the reform process. The Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Management and the State Law Office (SLO) will contribute to the reform process \nthrough overall guidance regarding the policies and navigating the legal processes, including \nstakeholder  consultations,  drafting  of  companies  act,  bankruptcy  and  insolvency  act,  and \ncompanies\u2019 registry road map. The public will participate through extensive consultations with key \norganizations and individuals that make up the stakeholder group. In addition, seminars will be \norganized to discuss the draft acts and the companies\u2019 registry road map. The implementation of \nthe TA will require 32 person-months of consulting services (22 person-months international, 10 \nperson-months  national).  The  international  consultant  team  will  be  recruited  from  a  firm  with \nexpertise in (i) business law reforms (including companies and bankruptcy and insolvency laws, \nand companies\u2019 registration); (ii) legal drafting; and (iii) institutional reforms. A national business \nlaw expert (10 person-months) will complement the international consultants. The outline terms of \nreference  for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  as  an \ninternational team using the quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006). \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Vanuatu for Financial Services Commission on Institutional and Legal Reforms, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved business  Positive investment rate and  Government economic  \u2022  The Government \nenvironment  economic growth  statistics and reserve  remains committed to \ncontributing to  bank reports  business law reform \nenterprise, investment,    \u2022  Businesses accept \nand economic growth  ADB economic updates  and respond \n    positively to the new \n  legal framework \n \nRisk \n\u2022  Political risk \nOutcome      Assumption \nReformed legislative  Business and professional  ADB private sector  \u2022  Reform proposals are \nand institutional  communities perceive the  development monitoring  supported by \nframework as  reformed institutional and  and programming  stakeholders \nadministered by VFSC  legal framework as relevant,  missions (private sector   \n  relatively clear, precise,  surveys), and ADB \n  complete, predictable, and  annual economic updates \ntransparent   \n  Annual updates of the \n  World Bank\u2019s Doing \nBusiness Survey  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
