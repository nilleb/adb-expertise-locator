THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Mandalay City, with a population of about 1.25 million, is the country\u2019s second-largest city \nand the capital of Mandalay Region. The city is the cultural, educational, and economic hub of \nUpper Myanmar and acts as a national economic center. Mandalay\u2019s population is growing at \nover 10% per year, much faster than the country\u2019s total population growth rate of 1.8% per year \nand urban population growth rate of 2.3% per year.1 While the city\u2019s population is about 2% of the \nnational population, its contribution to GDP is approximately 8%. It is expected that improved \nurban services will induce economic activities in Mandalay; thus, the project will contribute to \nfostering  balanced  national  development  by  reducing  the  concentration  of  population  and \neconomic activities in Yangon and promoting economic growth in Mandalay Region and its \nsurroundings. It is located on the Greater Mekong Subregion Northern Economic Corridor linking \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and India. In Mandalay Region, increased climate change \nvulnerability is observed such as shorter monsoon periods, longer pre-monsoon droughts, and \nhigher daily rainfall depths.2 These changing climatic conditions, in tandem with the expanding \nurban  area,  are  increasing  the  demand  for  reliable  water  resources,  effective  wastewater \ncollection and treatment, and improved urban drainage. \n \n2.  The coverage of the piped-water supply system is only 55% and the remaining residents \nuse mainly private shallow wells. The piped-water supply system serves for 10 hours per day on \naverage. Nonrevenue water is estimated at approximately 52%, of which at least 35,000 cubic \nmeter (m3)/day (about 70% of the total nonrevenue water) is due to physical losses from faulty \nmeters and leaks; the remainder is due to uncertainties in meter readings and authorized unbilled \nconsumption.3 Despite high population density and high pollution levels in received water, there \nis neither a piped sewerage system nor a centralized wastewater treatment plant. Sanitation \nprovision consists of septic tanks draining largely to the roadside drains, and latrines of varying \ndesigns.  Environmental  impacts  are  consequently  high,  with  pollution  of  watercourses  and \ngroundwater. The biochemical oxygen demand levels in major creeks in the city are up to 80 \nmilligrams per liter. About 780 tons per day of domestic solid wastes are collected by the \nMandalay City Development Committee (MCDC); however, large amounts are disposed in drains \nand canals. This causes not only degradation of environment and public health, but also increases \nflood damages due to reduction of drainage capacity. More than 60% of the waste is organic \nwaste, followed by plastics (15%) and paper (7%). There are about 15 transit stations in the city, \ntypically along the streets and occupying public spaces. There are two existing dump sites without \nappropriate  treatment.  During  the  wet  season,  floods  are  caused  mainly  by  the  lack  of \nmaintenance of canals and storage ponds, as well as insufficient capacities of the existing \npumping  stations.  The  road  network  is  largely  uncongested  except  the  city  center  area. \nMotorcycles, public transport vehicles, and delivery trucks park on the streets, narrowing roads, \nand thus, causing congestion. \n \n3.  The  Mandalay  Regional  Government  (MRG)  does  not  directly  intervene  in  urban \nmanagement matters in Mandalay City but it has a significant role in approving infrastructure \nprojects  and  urban  service  tariffs.  The  MCDC  is  tasked  with  urban  service  delivery  and \ninfrastructure development as stated in the Mandalay Development Law (2015).4 The MCDC\u2019s \ncurrent revenues have not increased as fast as operating expenses, and transfer from the Union \n                                                \n1  Department of Population, Ministry of Immigration and Population. 2015.

Therefore, it \nis difficult to attract the private sector in investing in delivery of these services. \n \n4.  MUSIP15 was approved on 12 November 2015, signed on 9 September 2016, and \nbecame effective on 19 April 2017. MUSIP1 addresses part of the core urban problems and \nbinding constraints described in paragraphs 3 and 4 through (i) improved water supply systems, \n(ii) improved wastewater and drainage management, and (iii) strengthened capacity for urban \nservices management. MUSIP1 is financed by (i) $60 million loan from the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB),  (ii)  $4  million  grant  from  the  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund \n(UCCRTF)6 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility administered by ADB, (iii) \u20ac40 million \nloan from  the  Agence Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD),  and (iv) \u20ac8  million grant from \nEuropean  Union\u2019s  Asian  Investment  Facility  administered  by  AFD. The  AFD  loan  and  the \nEuropean Union grant are implemented in parallel with ADB loan and UCCRTF grant. MUSIP1 \nwas the first loan for ADB in the urban development sector in Myanmar after reengagement and \nthe first external loan from development partners for MCDC; thus, the scope of MUSIP1 focused \non the limited number of priority subsectors that require urgent improvement. At the same time, \ncomprehensive urban sector analyses were conducted for future intervention during project \npreparation, covering urban planning and land management, water supply, wastewater and \nsanitation, drainage and flood protection, solid waste management, and urban transport. The \nscope  of  the  Second  Mandalay  Urban  Services  Improvement  Project  (MUSIP2)  has  been \nproposed based on the priorities and timeline identified under these sector analyses. \n \n5.  Indicative impact of MUSIP2 will be improved urban environment and public health \nconditions in Mandalay. Indicative outcome will be improved urban services in Mandalay.7 It is \nproposed that MUSIP2 will have two outputs: (i) urban infrastructure upgraded and (ii) urban \nservice management capacity strengthened. For output 1, the MUSIP2 will continue to support \nthe improvement of water supply systems and the wastewater management, that were started \nunder MUSIP1. In addition, MUSIP2 will cover solid waste management and urban transport \nmanagement,  not  included  in  MUSIP1.  MUSIP1  was  designed  to  showcase  an  integrated \nenvironmental improvement approach in the areas along Thingazar Creek. This approach will be \nfollowed  in  MUSIP2.  Infrastructure  components  covered  by  MUSIP1  and  MUSIP2  are \nsummarized in Table1 that clearly shows how MUSIP2 will complement MUSIP1. \n \nTable 1: Infrastructure Components of MUSIP1 and MUSIP2 \nSubsector  MUSIP1 (Apr 2016\u2013Mar 2023)  MUSIP2 (Apr 2020\u2013Mar 2027) \nWater  supply  Households with access to water supply without  The number of households with access without \nsystem  interruption increased from 19,000 (2014) to  interruption  further  increased  through  the \n124,000 (2024) through the upgrading of water  construction of new water intake at Dothtawady, \ntreatment plant and reservoir, rehabilitation and  expansion of distribution networks, increase of \nconstruction  of  distribution  networks,  connections, and non-revenue water reduction. \nreplacement of connections, and non-revenue \nwater reduction. \nWastewater  Direct  discharge  of  wastewater  to  receiving  BOD loading to environment reduced through \nmanagement  waters  reduced  from  85,000  cubic  meter  increase  of  wastewater  treatment  capacity, \n(m3)/day  (2014)  to  25,000  m3/day  (2024)  improvement of treatment process, expansion \nthrough construction of wastewater treatment  of  interceptor  and  sewerage  networks, \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2015.

For output 2, MUSIP2 will continue activities initiated under MUSIP1 including (i) training \nprograms in urban planning and management, municipal financial management, nonrevenue \nwater reduction, tariff policy, and O&M; (ii) policy dialogue on cost recovery, climate change \nresilience, enabling environment for private sector participation, and integrated wastewater, solid \nwaste, and flood risk management; and (iii) public awareness programs conducted on public \nhealth and environmental protection. \n \n7.  The indicative project cost is estimated at $180 million. ADB will provide a concessional \nloan  of  $150 million  from  its  ordinary  capital  resources to  help finance  the  project.  Other \ncofinancing sources will provide $15 million, and the government will provide $15 million. AFD \nprovided parallel financing for MUSIP1 to support the water supply system improvement. AFD \nmight also interested in providing a parallel financing or a joint cofinancing for MUSIP2. Details \nwill be identified during project preparation. \n \n8.  The ensuing loan to support MUSIP2 and this transaction technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare MUSIP2 are included in the Country Operations Business Plan: Myanmar 2017\u20132019.  \n \nII.
