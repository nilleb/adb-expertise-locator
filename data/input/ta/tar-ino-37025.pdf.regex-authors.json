", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Indonesia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide advisory technical assistance (TA) to strengthen the capacity of the Commission for \nEradication of Corruption (KPK) and implement this TA through the Partnership for Governance \nReform in Indonesia. An ADB fact-finding mission undertook discussions with representatives of \nthe Government of Indonesia during November 2003 on the proposed TA to strengthen KPK\u2019s \ncapacity after its establishment. As KPK was established in late December 2003 the Mission \nresumed the discussions in February 2004 with the newly appointed KPK Commissioners. The \nMission reached an understanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s purpose, scope, and \nimplementation arrangements. The Mission also held consultations with civil society groups\u2019 \nrepresentatives. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1. The TA is included in the 2004 \nIndonesia country program.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy2  provides  increased  focus  on  supporting  anticorruption \nefforts as part of ADB\u2019s broader emphasis on good governance and capacity building. The \nCountry Strategy and Program for Indonesia3 recognizes good governance as a central pillar of \nADB\u2019s  assistance  to  the  country  and  defines  several  areas  for  anticorruption  initiatives, \nparticularly in the context of decentralization. These areas are support for general anticorruption \nefforts such as audit reform and continued support for procurement reform; support to the \nPartnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia; and introduction of effective anticorruption \nmechanisms in ADB-funded projects. The country strategy and program in this respect reflects \nthe  Government\u2019s  own  identification  of  the  supremacy  of  law  and  good  governance  as  a \nnational development priority within the national development plan (Propenas) 2000\u20132004. The \nKPK will be in need of support for a much longer period than the life span of this TA, and ADB \nmay thus consider further support subject to the successful outcome of this TA, based on the \nGovernment\u2019s requests and close coordination with other international funding agencies active \nin Indonesia. \n \n3.  Three important laws in support of a general process of combating corruption have been \nenacted since 1999, including Law 31/1999 on Eradication of Criminal Acts of Corruption, Law \n15/2002  on  Eradication  of  Money  Laundering,  and  Law  30/2002  on  the  Commission  for \nEradication of Corruption. Important institutional development has also taken place, with a range \nof  state  auxiliary  bodies  established  with  mandates  that  contribute  to  the  fight  against \ncorruption. These bodies include the Commission for the Audit of the Wealth of State Officials \n(KPKPN),  which  will  merge  with  KPK;  National  Ombudsman  Commission;  National  Law \nCommission; and Commission for the Eradication of Money Laundering. KPK will thus form a \ncritical part of and become a focal point for a comprehensive institutional framework for tackling \ncorruption in Indonesia. \n \n4.  Law 31/1999 provides for KPK\u2019s establishment. Law 30/2002 sets out KPK\u2019s institutional \ndesign and legal jurisdictions and elaborates on the preparations and procedures necessary for \nits  establishment.  According  to  Article  6  of  Law  30/2002,  KPK\u2019s  responsibilities  include  (i) \ncoordinating  with  and  supervising  agencies  having  authority  to  eradicate  corruption;  (ii) \nconducting investigations, interrogations, and prosecutions in connection with corruption; (iii) \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 December 2003. \n2  ADB. 1998.  Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  \n3  Country Strategy and Program for Indonesia, 2002. Manila. ", "2 \ntaking steps to prevent corruption; and (iv) monitoring the functioning of state institutions. Article \n11  of  the  law  states  that  KPK  is  authorized  to  conduct  examinations,  investigations,  and \nprosecutions for corruption cases that (i) involve law enforcement officials, judiciary personnel, \nstate officials, and any third party related to alleged corrupt activity committed by such officials; \n(ii) provoke public anxiety; and (iii) involve a minimum state loss of Rp1 billion.  \n \n5.  KPK  will  have  four  divisions:  (i)  Prevention  Division,  (ii)  Prosecution  Division,  (iii) \nInformation and Data Division, and (iv) Internal Supervisory and Public Complaint Division. \nKPK\u2019s mandate covers Indonesia nationwide. While KPK will be headquartered in Jakarta, KPK \nmay  also  form  offices  in  the  provinces.  Five  commissioners,  of  which  one  is  elected \nchairperson, will collectively lead KPK with a four member advisory team and executive staff. \nKPKPN will merge with KPK and serve as KPK\u2019s Prevention Division.  \n \n6.  KPK has a huge mandate, in terms of responsibilities and geographic spread. Many \ndifferent kinds of tasks, requiring a variety of staff skills and operating procedures, will be \nperformed, and all tasks must comply with the rule of law. Although Law 31/1999 spells out \nKPK\u2019s main procedures, much work must go into developing operating procedures and into \ndeciding how the various divisions and their tasks should interrelate with each other. This \nshould be done at the outset.  \n \n7.  Anticorruption efforts are particularly important in the context of the decentralization of \nresponsibilities  within  most  government  sectors  that  took  place  in  2001.  Today,  district4 \ngovernments are responsible for major public functions, including education and health and \nurban or rural development. However, in most cases, regional governments\u2019 capacities to deal \nwith their new responsibilities are low, and safeguards to prevent corruption are not in place. \nWithin this context, KPK will assume a crucial role in spearheading a strategy for tackling \ncorruption that brings together credible initiatives already started across Indonesia, through a \nroad map. This will be an important initial task for KPK. \n \n8.  According to Article 9 of Law 30/2002, KPK shall in the future be able to take over from \npolice officers and public prosecutors corruption cases that meet the criteria defined in the law. \nThe law even stipulates in its transitional provisions that KPK shall take over ongoing cases \nfrom these individuals. These provisions do not necessarily coincide with regulations governing \nother authorities. How to develop legal and practical arrangements for the transfer of cases in a \nway that will be accepted by all involved institutions will be a delicate task that KPK will have to \ndeal with at an early stage. Other provisions in Law 30/2002 also may conflict with provisions in \nother legislation. For example, KPK is empowered to request certain information from state \ninstitutions, but there seem not to be any corresponding provisions obliging these institutions to \ndisclose the information requested. Similarly, the law authorizes KPK to request the suspension \nof a state official involved in a corruption case. But as long as higher officials continue to be \nprotected from investigation and prosecution under civil service regulations, such provisions will \nturn out to be void in practice. These kinds of regulatory conflicts in Law 30/2002 merit an \nanalysis that would lead to proposals on how to harmonize other laws with Law 30/2002.  \n \n9.  The Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia, which is described in more detail \nin Appendix 4, has anticorruption as a main focus for its work and is heavily involved in \nsupporting the preparations for the establishment of KPK. The Partnership for Governance \nReform in Indonesia now runs a program to support KPK that includes, among other things, \n                                                 \n4  In this report, the term district refers to kabupaten (regencies) and kota (cities). The term region corresponds to the \nIndonesian term daerah and thus refers to provinces and districts. ", "    3 \nsupport for selection and recruitment of staff members, support to develop a KPK strategy, and \nsupport  for  KPK  strategy  consultations  throughout  the  country.  As  this  TA  will  closely \ncomplement the support program, the TA\u2019s being implemented through the Partnership for \nGovernance Reform in Indonesia is highly justified.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The goal of the TA is to improve governance by reducing corruption in Indonesia\u2019s \nsociety, through KPK\u2019s performing effectively and in accordance with standards of successful \ncommissions in other countries. The immediate objective is to help KPK become appropriately \nprepared  and  equipped  to  prevent  corruption  cases  and  carry  out  related  investigations, \ninterrogations, and prosecutions; supervise other agencies; and monitor corruption in society. \nThe TA will assist KPK by (i) supporting the development and introduction of KPK\u2019s standard \noperating procedures (SOP), (ii) helping develop cooperation arrangements with police and \npublic  prosecutors,  (iii)  procuring  and  installing  relevant  supporting  information  and \ncommunications technology (ICT) equipment, (iv) assessing training needs and designing and \nimplementing initially relevant training programs for KPK\u2019s staff, and (v) designing external \ndissemination activities necessary to make KPK\u2019s role understood in society. In several of these \nareas of assistance this TA is a follow-up to TA 3381-INO Establishment of an Anticorruption \nCommission.5 The many important outputs from that TA will be used under this TA. \n \n11.  The inception report will be submitted within 1 month after commencement. The report \nwill include an outline work program for the TA and any apparent or likely barriers that would \nprevent the TA\u2019s successful outcome. The report will also make detailed recommendations \nconcerning the types of ICT equipment to procure under the TA, considering KPK\u2019s needs and \nthe TA\u2019s budget. The interim report will be submitted at the end of September 2004, upon \ncompletion of the draft SOPs and upon the completion of the training program\u2019s design and the \nstart of its implementation. The draft final report will be submitted 3 weeks before the TA\u2019s \ncompletion. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.   The TA will help develop SOPs for KPK. Moreover, the TA will help review relevant \nlegislation guiding KPK\u2019s operations and performance, as a basis for developing SOPs, taking \ninto account rule of law requirements; procedures defined in Law 31/1999; and KPK\u2019s need to \nact efficiently in each case and effectively cooperate and coordinate with other agencies, within \na limited period of time, as this will also provide a basis for developing SOPs. Provisions in Law \n30/2002 and in Law 31/1999 that conflict with other legislation should be identified, and ways to \nsolve regulatory conflicts should be proposed. SOPs should support the human resources \nmanagement  system  developed  by  KPK  and  include  appropriate  human  resources \nmanagement  procedures. \n \n13.  If KPK is to perform successfully, a training needs assessment of KPK\u2019s staff members \nis required, followed by the design and implementation of training programs for the entire staff. \nThese activities will give commissioners and relevant staff members exposure to international \n                                                 \n5  ADB.  1999.

", "4 \nbest practices, including other countries\u2019 experiences with similar anticorruption commissions. \nTraining programs will be designed in ways that KPK can use them after the completion of this \nTA. \n \n14.  To assist KPK in becoming fully operational in its four divisions, ICT equipment will be \nprovided. KPK needs a secure database and ICT support to manage and monitor its operations. \n \n15.  Acceptance of KPK\u2019s mandate and public support for its role will require strategies \ndevelopment  and  activities  implementation  designed  to  create  understanding  among  state \ninstitutions, private enterprises, civil society organizations, and concerned individuals on what \nconstitutes corruption and how KPK is tasked to fight this. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $315,000 equivalent, comprising $150,000 in \nforeign currency cost and $165,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $250,000 \nequivalent to finance $150,000 of the foreign currency cost and $100,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the TASF. The Government, \nthrough KPK, will provide offices and staff to finance the balance of the local currency cost \nequivalent to $65,000. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan for the TA are shown in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  KPK  is  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Government  has  requested  the  Partnership  for \nGovernance Reform in Indonesia to act as the Implementing Agency. The Partnership will \nappoint, at its expense, a TA project manager. Procurement under the TA will be made by the \nconsultants, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Establishing a steering \ncommittee that will meet regularly (at least quarterly) to monitor progress is recommended. This \ncommittee, chaired by KPK, will include ADB and Partnership representatives. \n \n18.  KPK will contribute by providing office space and counterpart staff members for the TA \nteam.  KPK  should  provide  (i)  air-conditioned  offices  for  the  TA  team  and  (ii)  sufficient \nadministrative support, including support staff members. \n \n19.  Approximately 26 person-months of consulting services will be required over a period of \n9 calendar months, commencing in June 2004 and ending in March 2005. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants is given in Appendix 3. The input is estimated to be 7 person-months \nfor the international consultant and 19 person-months for domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Since  the \nPartnership  for  Governance  Reform  in  Indonesia  will  provide  a  project  manager,  the \ninternational consultant would not need to be team leader or always in place. \n \n20.   Meetings  involving  the  consultant  team,  Partnership  for  Governance  Reform  in \nIndonesia, KPK, and ADB will be held 2 weeks after the submission of the inception report, the \ninterim report, and the draft final report. Simplified progress reports will be submitted each week, \nin conjunction with weekly progress meetings involving the consultant team, Partnership, and \nKPK. \n \n ", "    5 \nIV.

In  March  2000,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  joined  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, World Bank, and other bilateral funding institutions in supporting the \nestablishment of the Partnership for Governance Reform in Indonesia (the Partnership). The \nPartnership was established by a group of reform-minded Indonesians to be a platform for \ngovernance reform efforts supporting Indonesia\u2019s transition toward democracy. The Partnership \nwas designed to support Indonesian initiatives from committed people across society. \n \n2.    The Partnership\u2019s unique approach reflects an emerging global consensus that reformed \ngovernance practices cannot be imposed from outside in a sustainable way. National ownership \nis the key to change. The Partnership has therefore been assigned to facilitate a coordinated \nand strategic approach to reform by bringing together key Indonesian government, civil society, \nand private sector stakeholders.  \n \n3.  The  Partnership,  an  Indonesian  institution,  acts  on  behalf  of  the  Government.  The \ninstitution manages a $35 million trust fund provided on a grant basis from bilateral assistance \nsources, to support Indonesian governance reform initiatives. The Partnership also manages a \nfacility to cover its operating costs and the costs of external activities that aim to engage \nstakeholders  or  prepare  for  projects  funded  under  the  trust  fund.  Partnership  funds  are \nregistered in the state budget, and Partnership-funded projects are audited by the Supreme \nAudit Institution. The funds are administered by the Partnership on behalf of the National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS)  under a memorandum of understanding. The \nPartnership has a governing board that advises on policy lines and other major issues. The \ngoverning board comprises Indonesian government officials (including the Minister of Finance \nand  the  BAPPENAS  chairperson),  Indonesian  civil  society  representatives,  and  major \ninternational  funding  agency  representatives.  ADB\u2019s  Indonesia  Resident  Mission  country \ndirector sits on the governing board. An executive board comprising the Indonesian members of \nthe  governing  board  leads  the  Partnership  and  decides on  strategic  issues  and  on  larger \nprojects. A policy advisory committee reviews all executive director proposals to the board and \nprovides the executive director with policy advice. ADB staff members sit on the policy advisory \ncommittee,  together  with  representatives  of  BAPPENAS,  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme, and World Bank. \n \n4.  The Partnership\u2019s vision is to extend and deepen the nature of cooperation between \ninternational funding agencies and Indonesia, in support of governance reform. The Partnership \nis recognized by the Government of Indonesia as having the authority to implement projects \nfinanced by foreign development assistance. The Partnership identified a number of priorities to \nbe supported, which include developing anticorruption, decentralization, and legal and judicial \nexpertise as well as civil service and police reform expertise. The Partnership has credibly \noperated in sensitive fields that remain difficult for international funding agencies to navigate, \nsuch as police reform and addressing political corruption. The Partnership recently engaged \nmajor  Indonesian  Muslim  organizations  to  fight  corruption,  and  the  Partnership  is  working \nclosely with multiple government agencies at national and local levels. The organization has \ndeveloped a unique niche in supporting reformers across Indonesia and can reach out in ways \nbeyond those available to most international funding agencies. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040608165503+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20040603152953+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - Document1", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 15 March 2004) \n \nCurrency Unit \u2013  rupiah (Rp) \nRp1.00 =  $0.1181  \n$1.00 =  Rp8,465 \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS  \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  BAPPENAS  \u2013  Badan Perancanaan Pembangunan Nasional (National \nDevelopment Planning Agency) \n  CSP  \u2013  country strategy and program \n  ICT  \u2013  information and communications technology \n  KHN  \u2013  Komisi Hukum Nasional (National Law Commission) \n  KON  \u2013  Komisi Ombudsman Nasional (National Ombudsman \nCommission \n  KPK  \u2013  Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi (Commission for Eradication of \nCorruption) \n  KPKPN  \u2013  Komisi Penyelidik Kekayaan Penyelenggara Negara \n(Commission for Audit of the Wealth of State Officials) \n  NGO  \u2013  non-government organization \n  PROPENAS  \u2013  Program Pembangunan Nasional (National Development Plan) \n  SOP  \u2013  standard operating procedures \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TOR  \u2013  terms of reference \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis report was prepared by a team consisting of Staffan Synnerstrom (team leader), and \nLaksminingsih Munandar.
