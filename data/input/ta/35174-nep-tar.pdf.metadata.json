The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  broad-based  assistance  to  the \nGovernment of Nepal for the education sector, covering primary and secondary education, and \nvocational training. During the Country Program Confirmation Mission of November 2003, the \nGovernment requested ADB assistance for a sectorwide reform of school education to achieve \nits goal of poverty reduction. Subsequently, advisory technical assistance (TA) Preparation for \nan Education Sector Development Policy and Strategy (ESDPS) was approved.1 An Education \nSector Development Program I was included in the Country Strategy and Program (2005\u2013\n2009). The Fact-Finding Mission for the project preparatory TA conducted  during 31 January\u2013\n10  February  2005  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  methodology, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing plan, and the consulting services for the \nproposed TA.2 The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The education system of Nepal consists of 5 years (grades 1\u20135) of primary education, 3 \nyears  (grades  6\u20138)  of  lower  secondary  education,  2  years  (grades  9\u201310)  of  secondary \neducation,  and  2  years  (grades  11\u201312)  of  higher  secondary  education.  A  school  leaving \ncertificate (SLC) is awarded by a centrally administered national examination at the end of \ngrade 10. The Government is considering integrating grades 6\u20138 into primary education and \ngrades 11\u201312 into secondary education, making for a fully integrated school education from \ngrades 1\u201312. Significant challenges remain in increasing equity in access and in improving the \nquality  and  efficiency  of  education  at  all  levels.  Though  access  to  primary  education  has \nimproved  over  the  last  five  decades,  high  repetition,  and  dropout  rates  and  poor  learning \noutcomes, especially among girls and the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are major \nconcerns. Despite the Government\u2019s effort to meet the increasing demand for lower secondary \neducation  and  above,  financing  gaps,  poorly  qualified  teaching  force,  and  institutional \nweaknesses  and  fragmentation  hamper  the  improvement  of  efficiency  and  performance  of \nschool education as a whole.  \n \n3.  The National educational policy in Nepal is directed by the overarching national goal of \npoverty reduction as reflected in the Tenth Plan (2003\u20132007). The national educational goal is \nto develop an effective and equitable public education system for grades 1\u201312. The existing \nprimary  and  secondary  subsector  programs  interpret  macropolicies  and  specify  goals, \noperational policies, strategies and program components for each subsector. However, despite \ncogent policies and programs based on local and international best practices, many of the \nambitious  targets  set  in  macro,  subsector,  and  project  documents  are  unlikely  to  be  met, \naccording to the Nepal Business Plan for the Education Sector (National Planning Commission, \n2005). Ongoing challenges at the system level include inefficiencies that drain resources and \nabsence of a holistic approach to the entire school education sector. At the school level, policies \naimed at improving efficiency are often unenforced and coordination of quality improvement \nprograms remains weak. Although part of the achievement gap is attributable to financing gaps, \nthe key challenges to education development in Nepal are (i) structural and policy integration \ninto a 1\u201312 school system, and (ii) coordination of program implementation at the school level.   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Preparation for Education Sector Development \nPolicy and Strategy. Manila (TA 4326-NEP). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 16 February 2005. \n ", "2   \n4.  The  Tenth  Plan  articulates  a  human  resources  development  plan  that  includes  an \nintegrated 1\u201312 school system with multiple exit points. At this juncture the Ministry of Education \nand Sports (MOES) is still in the initial stage of developing a policy framework that addresses \nthe 1\u201312 school sector as an integrated whole. As a result, differences of interpretation at the \nsubsector programming level combine with ambiguity in the macro level to send confusing \nmessages to stakeholders. The situation hampers implementation and prevents efficient use of \nresources.  Examples  of  policy  areas  that  warrant  additional  consolidation  include  teacher \nmanagement and development, performance standards, sector and school finance, devolution \nof school operations, curriculum and assessment.    \n \n5.  Some education policies cut across all subsectors. For example, the Tenth Plan frames \neducation as an intrinsic basic human right, ensuring that no child will be denied the opportunity \nto complete schooling due to poverty or prejudice. This idea requires a special focus on girls and \nexcluded groups in each subsector. Under decentralization, the Government is fulfilling this \nmandate through a combination of advocacy and financial incentives that encourage schools to \nenroll and retain girls and disadvantaged children. These measures are not likely to be enough \nas the current program underestimates the strain at the school and community levels to support \ncompletion and academic success of girls and disadvantaged children. Additional support is \nrequired if the Tenth Plan vision for an egalitarian 1\u201312 public school system is to be achieved. \n \n6.  Changes in the broad sociocultural, economic, or public administration contexts impact \ndeeply on education program emphasis and implementation. As with any medium- or long- \nrange strategy, issues emerge during the implementation period that were not addressed in the \nTenth  Plan,  or  existing  programs.  Among  them  are  emerging  issues  related  to  displaced \nchildren as a result of the insurgency, and new priorities requiring additional investment that \nmay emerge as a result of a recent change in the political context in Nepal.3 \n \n7.  Based on decades of experience, development assistance in education in Nepal shows \na  genuine  transition  from  a  projectized  and  fragmented  approach  toward  a  policy-led    \nsectorwide approach. The Government\u2019s capacity to lead multi-agency-funded programs has \nincreased.  At  the  primary  level,  Nepal  has  initiated  the  Education  for  All  (EFA)  program, \nfinanced  under  a  joint  financing  arrangement  (JFA)  with  five  aid  agencies  wherein \ndisbursements are made on the basis of agreed-upon outcome and achievement indicators.4 \nEFA, through JFA is a Government-led multipartners program that is seen as a model of a \nsubsector-level sectorwide approach. At the secondary level, the Secondary Education Support \nProgram (SESP) 5 supported by ADB and Denmark is a result of extensive subsector analysis \nand  policy  dialogue  and  is  built  on  a  shared  long-term  vision  and  strategy  for  secondary \neducation reform and institutional development. The next logical step in the evolution of Nepal\u2019s \neducation system will be a fully integrated sectorwide approach for grades 1\u201312. \n \n8.  The ultimate goal of the Government is to improve the efficiency and performance of the \nschool education sector by developing a fully holistic, integrated, and results-focused grades 1\u2013\n12 school sector development program by 2009. It plans to adopt a sectorwide approach using \nGovernment  procedures.  ADB  intends  to  assist  the  Government  in  achieving  its  goal  by \nfinancing part of the program through phased interventions: (i) Education Sector Development \n                                                 \n3  On 1 February 2005, King Gyanendra dismissed the Government of Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, and \nassumed executive power.    \n4  Denmark,  Department  for  International  Development,  Finland,  Norway,  and  World  Bank  joined  JFA.  Other \nagencies, including ADB, support EFA through parallel financing outside JFA. \n5  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nKingdom of Nepal for the Secondary Education Support Project. Manila. \n ", "  3\nProgram I (ESDP I) (2006\u20132008), and (ii) Education Sector Development Program II (ESDP II) \n(2009\u20132011).6 ESDP I plans to support a transitional school sector development program, while \nESDP II will support a fully integrated school sector development program.  \n \n9.  Under the ongoing advisory TA ESDPS, MOES has mobilized a core group of senior \nofficers  whose  responsibilities  cover  program  development  and  implementation  to  analyze \ncurrent policies, programs, and investments from a school sectorwide perspective. The core \ngroup  is  working  on  developing  a  consolidated  and  integrated  1\u201312  school  sector  policy \nframework that will set the direction for further sector analysis and policy work in preparation for \na sectorwide policy, program, and investment framework to be implemented from 2009.  \n  \n10.   It is understood that during ESDP I, current subsector policies, programs, budgeting, \nplanning, or management structures such as EFA or SESP will not be modified unless the \nconcerned  development  partners  agree.  However,  ESDP  I  will  address  funding  gaps  that \naddress crosscutting issues across subsectors. ESDP I will have two components: component A \nwill  meet  immediate  funding  gaps  for  crosscutting  policies  such  as  participation  and \nachievement of girls, disadvantaged groups, and extremely poor children. Some financing may \nalso be available for policy issues and targets set for emerging issues as described in para. 6. \nComponent B will continue consolidating the school sectorwide policy, developing sectorwide \nprogramming, and initiate policy reform actions in key areas such as teacher management and \ndevelopment,  performance  standards,  sector  and  school  finance,  devolution  of  school \noperations, and curriculum and assessment. Components A and B are closely linked. Funding \nfor component A should be justified by its contribution toward component B. At the end of ESDP \nI,  a  more  comprehensive  education  sectorwide  policy,  sector  development  program,  and \ninvestment framework should be ready for support under ESDP II.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will assist the Government to prepare ESDP I that will help develop a holistic \napproach to school education to improve its efficiency and performance. ESDP I will build on \nsubsector-level programs such as EFA and SESP, without changing any of the subsector \nprogram  structures  including  JFA.  The  TA  will  provide  a  mechanism  for  all  interested \ndevelopment partners to join the policy and program development process from the earliest \nstage.  \n \n12.  The outcomes of the TA will be (i) a comprehensive sector analysis, based on an \nanalysis of policy and institutional gaps and constraints that hinder sector development; (ii) a \nmechanism  for  continuous  policy  dialogue  with  all  stakeholders,  including  development \npartners,  and  enhanced  Government  leadership  in  policy  development;  (iii)  a  strategic \nframework for implementing time-bound policy actions during the period of ESDP I; and based \non the above, (iv) a proposed design for ESDP I that defines its objectives, rationale, program \nframework and components,  implementation arrangements, costs, and monitoring systems. \nThe  outputs  of  the  TA  will  help  ADB,  the  Government,  and  other  interested  development \npartners determine and agree on the program design for ESDP I. It will help ADB and the \nGovernment in examining and agreeing on the most appropriate lending modality. \n \n                                                 \n6 The project preparatory technical assistance for ESDP II is included in the Nepal Country Strategy and Program \n(2005-2009).   ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will review the analysis of policy gaps and institutional constraints made by the \ncore group, and lessons learned from EFA and SESP. According to progress in developing the \n1\u201312 sector policy framework, it will agree with MOES on areas of policy reform actions to be \ndiscussed  with  all  stakeholders  and  initiated  under  ESDP  I.  It  will  assess  the  financial \nrequirements associated with the identified policy reform actions, and the capacity development \nneeds. It will also undertake a public expenditure review and a review of the medium-term \nexpenditure framework. Furthermore, the TA will help project enrollment across subsectors and \ndefine a minimum service standard. With the enrollment projection, the public expenditure \nanalysis, and a defined minimum service standard, a more comprehensive sector financing plan \nwill be developed. The TA will refine the initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 2), review \nthe demand analysis, and recommend strategies to improve completion and achievement of \ngirls and disadvantaged ethnic minority groups. It will recommend strategies to address the \nimpact of the insurgency on schoolchildren.  \n \n14.  The TA will help establish a mechanism for continuous policy dialogue and facilitate \nGovernment-led  consultation  meetings  with  all  concerned  stakeholders:  (i)  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, the National Planning Commission, concerned education agencies; (ii) teacher unions, \ncivil society organizations; and (iii) development partners in education. The TA will help the \nGovernment consolidate the priority policy reform actions and develop a strategic framework for \nimplementing time-bound policy actions. The TA will undertake small-scale studies on emerging \nissues identified during the policy dialogue. The TA will also organize international peer reviews \non elements of the interim policy and program framework.   \n \n15.  Based on the outputs of the sector study, and along with the continuous policy dialogue, \nthe TA will propose a design for ESDP I. The TA will assess the implementation mechanisms of \nEFA and SESP and suggest a framework for synergy and coordination between ESDP I and the \nongoing  subsector  programs.  Furthermore,  the  TA  will  suggest  a  strategic  framework  for \nintegrating existing subsector programs into ESDP II.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  continuously  assess  the  country\u2019s  sociopolitical  context  through  policy \ndialogue with the Government and development partners. Maximum flexibility will be applied to \nadjust TA implementation and ESDP I design, including the lending modality, to the change in \nneeds and the situation of the country. To ensure that the program development process for \nESDP I will involve all interested aid agencies from the earliest stage, the proposed working \nmechanism for the TA will be adjusted along with the process of consultation with interested \npartners to make the ESDP I preparation process a genuine joint effort led by the Government. \nThe  TA  will  coordinate  closely  with  current  technical  assistance  provided  by  development \npartners. Furthermore, the TA will work in close coordination with TA ESDPS. The TA work will \nbuild on the sector analysis and policy analysis and development undertaken by MOES under \nTA ESDPS. TA ESDPS will continue along with the TA and will help facilitate formulation of the \nschool sectorwide policy and identification of priority policy reform actions. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is expected to cost $750,000 equivalent of which ADB will provide $450,000 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Another $150,000 will be financed \nby  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  administered  by  ADB.  The  total  amount  of \n$600,000 will cover the entire foreign exchange component of $406,000, and local currency cost \nequivalent  of  $194,000.  ADB  will  finance  domestic  and  international  consulting  services, \n ", "  5\nproduction of reports, equipment, workshops, studies, field surveys, and administrative support \nservices. The Government support to the TA, estimated at $150,000 equivalent, will be in kind, \nand  will  include  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation  and  space  for \nmeetings, and general office support. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.   A team of four international and six domestic consultants will be recruited to provide \nspecialist services totaling 51 person-months (16 international, 35 domestic). ADB will engage \ninternational consultants on an individual basis and domestic consultants through a local firm \nusing the simplified technical procedure and the quality- and cost-based selection method in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Indicative terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. Office equipment needed to implement the TA will be procured \nby the consultants according to ADB\u2019 s Guidelines for Procurement and will be turned over to \nMOES upon TA completion.   \n \n19.  MOES will be the Executing Agency for the TA. MOES will establish an ESDP steering \ncommittee upon the start of the TA, chaired by the secretary of MOES, with representation from \nconcerned ministries, line agencies, civil society organizations, and development partners. The \nsteering  committee  will  provide  overall  guidance  to  ESDP  I.  To  maximize  Government \nleadership and minimize the strain on MOES, the TA work will be carefully scheduled and \nspaced. MOES has assured availability of counterpart staff to work with the TA team. The \nGovernment has also agreed to provide the following support to the TA team: (i) administrative \nand logistic support; (ii) office accommodation, supplies, and facilities; and (iii) data and reports \nas required. The TA consultants will report to the secretary of MOES and to ADB. \n \n20.  The TA will begin in January 2006 and end in October 2006. An inception report will be \nsubmitted at the end of the first month of the TA. A draft of the sector analysis and an initial \nframework of time-bound policy reform actions will be completed and submitted as an interim \nreport at the end of the first 3 months. A draft final report will be submitted with a draft program \ndesign  by  the  end  of  the  fifth  month.  One  or  more  consultation  workshops  inviting  all \nstakeholders will be held after each report is submitted. A final report incorporating comments \nfrom concerned parties will be submitted by the TA completion date.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund; and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of \nNepal for preparing the Education Sector Development Program I, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Nepal:  \n \nEducation is considered one of the major means for poor households to escape from the poverty trap. With external \nassistance, Nepal channeled many efforts to the education sector, which have contributed to improvements of human \ndevelopment indicators over the past years. The number of schools has increased significantly; in 2004, there were \n24,228 primary schools (27% increase from 1994), 8,522 lower secondary schools (68% increase), and 5,030 \nsecondary schools (84% increase). The net enrollment rate (NER) in primary schools has improved from 61% in 1990 \nto 84.2% in 2004; that in secondary schools, from 33% in 1990 to 43.9% in 2004. \n \nHowever, the current level of achievement in education is far from sufficient. Efficiency in the basic education sector is \nlow: repetition and dropout rates are high; the adult literacy rate is low at 49%; despite many efforts such as the \nEducation for All program, still about 20% of primary school age children are out of school; the pass rate for School \nLeaving Certificate (SLC) at the end of grade 10 is only 22% for public schools. The situation is aggravated by the \nlarge disparities in access to and attainment of education by gender, ethnicity, caste, and geographical location. \n \nNepal\u2019s Tenth Plan for 2002\u20132007 (i.e., poverty reduction strategy paper) identifies social sector development, \nincluding education sector development, as one of the four pillars that the Plan is based on; and aims at improving \naccess to and quality of primary education, expanding literacy programs, and developing/expanding secondary \neducation. The major strategy adopted by the Plan is decentralization of the management of local schools by handing \nit over to school management committees (SMCs). The decentralization process has already been initiated under the \n7th Amendment to Education Act 2001. \n  \nAnother major strategy under the Plan is to mitigate social, cultural, and financial barriers to easy access to education, \nespecially for the poor, disadvantaged ethnic/caste groups, and women. For example, the Government will expand the \npolicy of granting scholarships to first child or first girl of poor families from which none of the members have \ncompleted primary education. It will start a new program to provide free education up to the grade 10 for oppressed, \nbackward, and below-poverty-line (BPL) students and to set up a Rural Education Development Fund for funding the \neducation of marginalized communities.     \n \nThe Plan\u2019s stated targets in the education sector are (i) increase in the primary school NER from 82% to 90%, (ii) \nincrease in the adult literacy rate from 49.2% to 63%, and (iii) increase in the female literacy rate from 35.6% to 55%.    \n \nThe Government\u2019s commitment to education is reflected in its public expenditure allocation to education. The share of \nthe budget spent on education increased from 10% in the 1980s to 13% in the 1990s, and is planned to reach 16% in \n2004/05.  The  bulk  (60%  in  2002/03)  of  the  education  budget  goes  to  the  primary  education  subsector.  The \nGovernment further intends to raise the budget share to 17.5%, with the share going to basic/primary education being \nmaintained at around 60%. \n \nNepal\u2019s Poverty Partnership Agreement with ADB also places priority on improvements in basic social services and \ninfrastructure, including education services. The medium-term strategy for education stipulates that the quality of basic \neducation will be improved, that nonformal education/vocational training will be offered especially for women, and that \na relatively small group of specialists will be trained at the higher education level. In the long term, the Agreement \naims to raise the adult literacy rate to 100% and the primary cycle completion rate to 95%. \n \nB.   Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification:  Targeted intervention (MDGs)  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nNepal, with a population of 24.7 million and per capita gross domestic product GDP at $229, is one of the poorest \ncountries in the world. In spite of substantial development assistance received, poverty reduction has been very slow \nover the past two decades mainly due to slow economic growth combined with high population growth, weak social \nand economic infrastructure, and the continued insurgency.  \n \nPoverty incidence was estimated at 42% in the first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) 1996 and at 38% in 2001. \nThe second NLSS was conducted in 2003/04 and the estimation will be updated based on the results. In the high \ngrowth scenario, the Plan has a poverty incidence target of 30% by 2006/07.  ", " 8    Appendix 2 \n \n \nNepal\u2019s poverty is largely a rural phenomenon, as 86% of the total population live in rural areas and productivity \ngrowth in agriculture has been low. Poverty incidence in rural areas is nearly twice as high at 44% as in urban areas \n(23%), and over 90% of the poor live in rural areas. Within rural areas, poverty rate is the highest in the Mid-Western \nand Far-Western hill and mountain regions.  \n \nIn addition to geographical disparities in poverty incidence, Nepal\u2019s poverty is characterized by deep-rooted cultural \npractices. Women, ethnic groups (Janajatis), lower-castes (Dalits) and ex-Kamiyas have been excluded from benefits \nof development over generations, and disproportionately suffer from poverty. For example, Dalits earn less than half of \nwhat upper-caste groups earn; the literacy rate of Dalit women is a low 7%.  \n \nThe human development indicator (HDI) duplicates the analysis of income poverty. The HDI in Nepal is estimated at \n0.471 in 2001, marginal improvement from 0.403 in 1996; the variations in HDI between urban/rural, geographical \nregions, and higher/lower castes are significant.  \n  \nPoverty incidence is closely related to educational achievement. Among the out-of-school children, the majority are \ngirls and those from poor, disadvantaged families in remote areas; 25% of girls and 50% of ethnic/caste groups are \nnot attending primary schools. In the Mid-Western Region, 52% of children are out of primary schools. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?                   Yes                   No \n \nIs there a participation strategy?                  Yes                   No \n \nThe Plan stresses, as a strategic crosscutting approach, promotion of community participation in managing activities \nat the local levels, along with acceleration of the decentralization process in social services delivery. Accordingly, in \nthe education sector, the Government is committed to decentralization of the school education system to local \nauthorities and involvement of local communities in the management of schools. Under the 7th Amendment of \nEducation Act 2001, transfer of school management to communities, with accompanying incentive grants, started in \n2002; and, in early 2004, schools had been handed over to about 700 communities. The budget speech 2004/05 \nmade a target of handing over the management of additional 2,000 schools to communities within the fiscal year; by \n2007, the Government plans to transfer a third of public schools.   \n \nAt the village level, a Village Education Committee (VEC) is being formed in each Village Development Committee \n(VDC) to regularly monitor schools within the village, identify/mobilize local resources, and prepare a Village Education \nPlan (VEP). The Government will provide block grants to support the implementation of VEPs to VDCs, which in turn \nwill allocate the grant to prioritized activities.  \n \nAt the school level, SMCs will be empowered to monitor school activities. The chairperson and members of SMCs will \nbe elected from parents and made responsible for managing schools, preparing school improvement plans (SIPs) and \nrecruiting new teachers. Parent-teacher associations will be mobilized for educational development in all schools. \nFurthermore, partnership between SMCs and local community groups is promoted; support to SMCs from local \nwomen, children, and other community groups is envisaged to create increased ownership and broad participation in \nsocial monitoring of education service delivery.  \n \nLocal community groups are expected to do tasks such as social mapping and campaign organization, and act as \ncatalysts to change attitudes toward caste, gender, and ethnic exclusion among parents, teachers, and students. They \nare also encouraged to do social audits to track the allocation of funds channeled to schools through school block \ngrants and scholarships. \n \nFormal mechanisms/principles for coordination and partnership, through which different stakeholders will be engaged \nin  the  transitional  Education  Sector  Development  Program  I,  will  be  established  to  facilitate  policy  dialogue, \nconsultation, and negotiation. All stakeholders including civil society organizations, teacher unions, Government \nagencies, and development partners are invited to contribute to the policy development process under the leadership \nof  the  Government.  The  resulting  education  sectorwide  policy  framework  will  be  agreed  upon  with  all  key \nstakeholders.  \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                   Appendix 2  9 \nD.         Gender Development  \nStrategy to maximize impacts of women: \n \nGender-based disparities are a persistent concern in Nepal. Households headed by females constitute 19.6% of the \ntotal households, are poorer than households with male heads. Despite some progress, women still lag behind men in \nmost of HDIs. The adult literacy rate for women is 34.9%, just over half that of men at 62.7%; the average years of \nschooling for women are 1.95 years compared with 3.56 years for men. A higher proportion of males than females \nattend school at every age, but the differences are significantly higher after age 10.   \n \nThe Plan seeks to address the gender gap and facilitate social inclusion through targeted programs. The gender \nstrategy is to ensure equal access for women to social and economic services, including education. Targeted \nprograms in education include expanded literacy programs for women, scholarship programs for girls, hiring of more \nfemale teachers, and correction of the existing gender bias in the curricula. \n \nTo strengthen the policy on social inclusion, ESDP I will (i) assess the current Government incentives and support \nschemes to retain girls and disadvantaged children; (ii) formulate a policy for gender equity and social inclusion that \ngoes beyond participation and retention; (iii) assess the financial implication as well as institutional support required for \nimplementing the refined policy for social inclusion; (iv ) formulate a capacity development plan for schools, teachers, \nand institutions to implement, monitor, and evaluate the inclusion policy; (v) plan, organize, and facilitate participation \nof civil society organizations, teacher unions, association of disabled people, and community-based organizations in \ncontinuous policy dialogue for ESDP I \n \nA refined and more comprehensive policy for gender equity and social inclusion will be integrated into the grades 1\u201312 \nEducation  Sector  Development  Policy.  A  costed  policy  action  plan  for  social  inclusion,  including  a  capacity \ndevelopment plan and a monitoring plan for schools and district stakeholders will be integrated in the ESDP I design.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
