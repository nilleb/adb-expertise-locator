THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Shandong Clean Heating and Cooling Project.1 The report also describes \nthe proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) for the Air Quality Improvement in the \nGreater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Shandong Clean Heating and Cooling Project to be \nprovided by the Clean Energy Fund2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, and \nif the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the \nBoard, approve the administration of the TA.  \n \n2.  The proposed project is the fourth in a multiyear, multisector Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) support program for air quality improvement in the greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) \nregion. The first loan, which ADB approved in 2015, focused on policy reforms and strengthening \nregulatory capacity in Hebei Province.3 The second loan, approved in 2016, targeted better \naccess to finance, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, to scale up investments in \npollution reduction projects in the region.4 The third loan, approved in 2017, aimed to deploy \nadvanced technologies to reduce air pollution from large emitters in the agriculture, energy, \ntransport, and urban sectors.5 This proposed project will help Shandong Province shift to cleaner \nand more efficient heating and cooling by integrating various clean and renewable energy \nsources.6 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The greater BTH region is one of the most important economic regions in the PRC, \ngenerating about one-third of the country\u2019s gross domestic product. However, it also has a dense \npopulation and a high concentration of energy-intensive and highly polluting industries, which \nresult in widespread air pollution.7 Cities in the greater BTH region consistently top country \nrankings for the highest concentrations of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter \n(PM ) and other air pollutants. Exposure to high levels of PM  and other air pollutants is \n2.5 2.5\nassociated with health risks such as cardiovascular and respiratory disease, which contribute to \nmore than 1 million premature deaths annually in the PRC. \n                                                \n1  The original core Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region refers to Beijing and Tianjin municipalities and Hebei Province. \nDue to air pollution\u2019s transboundary impact, in 2017, the government extended the core BTH region to its surrounding \nregions. The greater BTH region includes the original core BTH region and its surrounding regions of Henan, \nLiaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n2  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n3  ADB. 2015.

Country \nOperations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n7  More than 50% of the PRC\u2019s pollution-intensive steel and cement production capacity, about 33% of the PRC\u2019s cars \nand other automobiles, and about 28% of the PRC population are concentrated in the greater BTH region. \n ", "2 \n4.  Shandong Province, as part of the greater BTH region, consistently experiences poor air \nquality that is attributable to an overreliance on coal as an energy source for heavy industry, \nelectricity, and heating. The province is the PRC\u2019s largest coal consumer, deriving 79.3% of its \nprimary energy mix from coal. Whereas coal consumption in the PRC peaked in 2013 and started \nto decline, Shandong Province\u2019s coal consumption increased substantially from 364.7 million tons \nin 2011 to 409.3 million tons in 2015.8 High levels of coal consumption, particularly by industry \nand urban and rural households, are the main contributors to poor air quality in the province. In \n2016, Jinan city had the highest concentration of PM attributable to coal use among 74 major \n2.5 \ncities in the PRC, and it ranked ninth in the province for the poorest air quality. Jinan Municipal \nBureau of Environmental Protection measured the annual average concentration of PM  in 2016\n2.5  \nat 73 micrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m\u00b3), which is more than double the category II national \nambient air quality standards.9 In Jinan, the annual concentration of PM specifically attributable \n2.5 \nto coal use is 52 \u03bcg/m3, about 70% of total PM2.5 concentration levels. During winter, even higher \nlevels\u201461 \u03bcg/m3 or 84%\u2014of PM2.5 emissions are attributable to coal use.10 Emissions are \nexacerbated during winter by the burning of raw coal by households for heating. The health \nimpacts of raw coal burning are more severe because of direct inhalation and the poor quality and \nhigh sulphuric content of the coal.  \n \n5.  The Government of the PRC has made air quality improvement a national priority and \nviews restructuring the energy mix as the key to realizing this objective. This is consistent with \nthe climate change mitigation specified in the PRC\u2019s intended nationally determined contributions. \nThe PRC\u2019s Thirteenth Five-Year Plan sets strict air quality measures and targets on PM ,sulfur \n2.5  \ndioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), and volatile organic compounds nationally, and for the BTH \n2 x\nregion. In support of the government\u2019s efforts on air quality improvement, ADB contributed, \ntargeted, and coordinated financing of $1.3 billion (footnotes 3, 4, and 5) and the World Bank did \nthe same for $1.0 billion. In 2017, the Ministry of Environmental Protection introduced the Work \nProgram for Air Pollution Control in the BTH Region and Its Surrounding Areas.11 The program \naims to implement strict pollution control measures in 28 cities, of which 7 are in Shandong \nProvince. The program emphasizes the importance of reducing winter raw coal burning for \nheating supply in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas of the greater BTH region. \n \n6.  The Shandong Provincial Government has also committed to improving air quality. In \n2012, it published the Action Plan for Air Pollution Control for 2013\u20132020.12 The plan targeted \nreducing annual average PM2.5 concentration levels to 49 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 by 2020. To meet this target \nShandong Province must reduce its coal consumption. Opportunities include exploiting the \nprovince\u2019s  abundant geothermal  resources,  agricultural  waste,  and  waste  heat from  heavy \nindustries. \n \n7.  The proposed project responds directly to the urgent national, provincial, and municipal \ngovernment priorities to reduce coal consumption and improve air quality. This will be achieved \n                                                \n8  Y. Zhang, C. Liu, K. Li, and Y. Zhou. 2018.

The proposed project is well-aligned with the priorities \nof broadening the response to climate change and strengthening environmental sustainability in \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.14 It will also support key strategic \npriorities  of  (i)  tackling  climate  change  by  using  advanced  technologies  to  accelerate  low \ngreenhouse gas emissions development and ensure environmental sustainability, (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality through gender mainstreaming activities, and (iii) making cities more \nlivable through air quality improvement resulting in safer and healthier urban environment for \nresidents, as prescribed in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.15  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s value addition and lessons from previous operations. Air quality improvement \nrequires coordinated interventions with different coverage and approaches. Unlike the first three \nprojects in ADB\u2019s multiyear, multisector support to the PRC for air quality improvement, this \nproposed project uses the project loan modality. Past projects used the financial intermediary \nmodality because the subprojects they supported were spread among many sectors that required \ndifferent business models and financing structures. The project loan modality is appropriate \nbecause the proposed project is narrowly focused on the heating and cooling industry in a \nconcentrated geographic area, which can result in effective and efficient delivery of project \noutcomes and large pollution reductions in a locality. The proposed clean heating and cooling \nsolutions will be a pilot in the PRC, with a large potential to be scaled up and duplicated in similar \nregions within and outside the country. ADB will organize technical knowledge exchange sessions \nduring project implementation to strengthen the capacity of the implementing agencies and \ndisseminate knowledge and lessons from this project to other developing member countries that \nface similar challenges in relation to cooling and heating. \n \n9.  Innovative features. The proposed project demonstrates advanced heating and cooling \ntechnologies with an innovative business model to deliver improved and efficient heating solutions \nto rural households in a cost-effective manner. The project utilizes government incentives to lower \nthe upfront costs of heating solutions for rural households, while capitalizing on the technical \nexpertise of the heating company to identify, manage, and deliver the most appropriate heating \nsolutions to households and enabling the company to sustainably expand its service area to semi-\nurban and rural areas around Jinan city. The project combines renewable energy technologies \nand waste heat recovered from industry and power plants and applies supply- and demand-side \nenergy efficiency measures. This will reduce the energy and carbon intensity of heat production \nand refrigeration, and thereby reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: air pollution reduced and public health in \nthe greater BTH region improved (consistent with the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan).16 The project will \n                                                \n13 The project will use advanced technologies for heating and cooling such as large temperature difference waste heat \nexchange, deep-well geothermal district heating, ice-storage air conditioning, and distributed heat pumps.   \n14  ADB. 2016.

To effectively coordinate and \nsupervise the project implementation, Shandong Provincial Government established a project \nmanagement office in Jinan, led by Shandong Provincial Department of Finance, Shandong \nProvincial Department of Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development, and Shandong Provincial \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, and involving Jinan Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, \nJinan Municipal Bureau of Finance, Jinan Municipal Development and Reform Commission, JHG, \nand  JTPC.  JHG  and  JTPC  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  management  during  project \npreparation and implementation. They will own, operate, and maintain all the facilities under the \nproject.  \n \n22.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM. All procurement to be financed and all consultant services to be recruited under the \nADB loan will be carried out in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2019\u2013April 2024 \nEstimated completion date   30 April 2024 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 October 2024 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Shandong Provincial Government  \n(ii)   Executing agency  Shandong Provincial Government \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  JHG and JTPC \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Jinan Provincial Government established the project management office in \nJinan  city,  led  by  the  Shandong  Provincial  Department  of  Finance, \nDepartment of Housing and Urban-rural Development, and Shandong \nProvincial Development and Reform Commission, and involving Jinan \nMunicipal  Bureau  of  Housing  and  Urban-rural  Development,  Jinan \nMunicipal Bureau of Finance, Jinan Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, JHG \nand JTPC.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  To strengthen project implementation capacity, ADB will provide an attached TA to (i) \ndevelop a road map for rural clean heating in northern PRC to provide integrated solutions \ncombining advanced technologies, innovative financing, and appropriate business models; (ii) \nmeasure indoor air pollution reduction in the rural households before and after the installation \nof clean heating systems in the project areas, which will be the first time an ADB project has \nmeasured this  impact; (iii)  undertake  awareness  campaign  on  environmental  and  health \nbenefits of clean heating; (iv) conduct a participant feedback survey in project areas to verify \nthe benefits of clean heating including time saving for preparation of household energy for \nheating; and (v) support enhancing the knowledge and understanding of JHG and JTPC staff \nin advanced heating and cooling technologies.20 \n \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis to be \nprovided by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and \nadministered by ADB (footnote 18). The government will provide counterpart support in the \nform of office accommodation, logistics, and facilities and remuneration of counterpart staff; \nstudies, reports, data, other information and support needed for the TA; and other in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Subproject 1: West Jinan Waste Heat Utilization and Clean Energy Subproject. This \nsubproject will provide heat to urban residents and industrial and business customers. The \ntechnologies to be used on the project include the following: (i) JTPC will adopt large temperature \ndifference waste heat exchange technology for transporting waste heat from the nearby power \nplants to the city. This technology has a higher heat transport capacity and lower heat losses over \nlong distances than current networks. JTPC will use the waste heat to supply heating to about 80 \nmillion m2 of buildings. (ii) JTPC needs to provide year-round heat supply to an industrial park \nlocated in west Jinan. A biomass-based combined heating and power plant using biomass \nbriquette will supply heating to 1.54 million m2 of buildings and will generate electricity of 133 \ngigawatt-hour per year. A feedstock assessment showed that the biomass plant will consume \nonly 12% of the available agriculture waste. (iii) Jinan is endowed with geothermal resources. The \n                                                \n20 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nsubproject will use deep-well reinjection technology to extract and exchange heat from the \nunderground water, which will then be filtered and recharged to the same aquifer, and (iv) \nDistributed  gas-fired  boilers  will  be  used  to  supply  heat  to  a  few  newly  built  residential \ncommunities not covered by the heating network and where geothermal resources are not \navailable. This subproject will enable Jinan to fully utilize waste heat in neighboring regions to \nform a waste-heat-dominated heating system with a supplementary distributed energy supply \nfrom biomass, geothermal energy, and natural gas. \n \n26.  Subproject 2: Shanghe Coal-Free Clean Heating Demonstration Subproject. This \nsubproject covers the urban area of Shanghe County, the semi-urban area of 11 towns, and \n80,000 rural households where coal-fired stoves or coal-fired boilers are commonly used for \nspace heating. The subproject will use geothermal energy as the main heat source to replace \ncoal-fired heating. Other clean options, such as air-source heat pumps, will be selected as \ndistributed heating sources where the pipeline network is not available. Gas-fired boilers will be \ninstalled as an auxiliary heat source. This subproject also plans to retrofit 660,400 m2 of urban \nbuildings and 30,000 rural households to improve their energy efficiency. JHG will replace heavily \npolluting coal-fired stoves in 80,000 rural households by air-to-air heat pumps, air-to-water heat \npumps, heat-storage radiators, carbon crystal plate radiators, and small household gas heaters.21 \nThis subproject will play an important role in, and have demonstration effect to, other counties in \nthe northern PRC that face similar air quality issues caused by the winter heating.   \n \n27.  Subproject 3: East Jinan Low-Emission Combined District Heating and Cooling \nSubproject. The central business district is located in east Jinan. The large heating and cooling \ndemands of this area require a low-emission system that can supply both heat and cooling. For \nheating supply, east Jinan will have two options: (i) industrial waste heat supplied via a long-\ndistance pipeline to heat 6.2 million m2 buildings; and (ii) electrode boilers with heat storage that \nwill use off-peak electricity at night, and then deliver hot water to the households in the daytime \nto heat an area of up to 700,000 m2. For district cooling, the subproject will adopt two technologies: \n(i) ice storage, which uses off-peak electricity during the night and stores the cooling energy in \nthe form of ice that is melted to provide cooling during peak daytime hours and when the cooling \ndemand is large enough; and (ii) a lithium bromide absorption chiller, driven by waste heat from \nthe  power  plant,  to  deliver  cold  water  to  consumers  through  long-distance  pipelines.  The \nsubproject aims to expand the area of waste heat supply, and at the same time use off-peak \nelectricity to produce and store heating and cooling capacity to improve waste heat utilization and \nshift load from peak.  \n \n28.  The technical due diligence confirmed the viability of the subprojects.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n29.  ADB estimated the economic internal rate of return of 43.0% for subproject 1, 33.2% for \nsubproject 2, and 14.2% for subproject 3, with the environmental benefits well above the 6.0% \neconomic cost of capital, making the project economically viable. Sensitivity testing indicated that \nthe project is likely to remain sustainable even in the face of adverse economic impacts of various \ntypes. The economic analysis considered all the project-related costs, benefits from cost savings \nresulting from the use of alternative fuels and system efficiency improvements, and local and \n                                                \n21 Among them, 60,000 households will use air-to-air heat pumps with CNY4,500 capital subsidy from the government, \n10,000 households will use air-to-water heat pumps with CNY9,000 capital subsidy, 6,000 households will use heat-\nstorage radiators with CNY2,000 capital subsidy, 3,000 households will install carbon crystal plate radiators and \n1,000 households have access to gas pipeline will install small household gas heaters each with CNY2,000 capital \nsubsidy from the government.  \n ", "9 \nglobal  environmental  benefits.  Global  environmental  benefits  from  carbon  dioxide  (CO ) \n2\nabatement are valued at the 2016 global social cost of carbon of $36.3 per ton of CO , adjusted \n2\nto 2018 price levels, and increased annually by 2%. Local environmental benefits from pollution \nemission  abatement  are  valued  by  estimating  the  cost  of  premature  mortality  (labor  loss) \nassociated with the pollutants. The project will generate revenue from the sale of heat, electricity, \nsteam, and cooling, and from the service connection fees collected from customers in the project \nareas. Financial analysis of the project indicated a financial internal rate of return of 8.40% for \nsubproject 1, 6.71% for subproject 2, and 14.27% for subproject 3. The financial internal rates of \nreturn exceed the weighted average cost of capital of 2.02% for subproject 1, 1.67% for subproject \n2, and 1.84% for subproject 3. Sensitivity analysis showed the project is likely to remain financially \nviable under several potential adverse scenarios. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n30.  Financial  management  assessment.  ADB  conducted  the  financial  management \nassessment  following  ADB\u2019s  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects.22 The  result \nshowed that JHG and JTPC have adequate financial management systems and procedures in \nplace to meet ADB requirements. However, neither of them is familiar with ADB\u2019s disbursement \nprocedures, and this may delay the disbursements.23 To address the risk, ADB trained JHG and \nJTPC staff on disbursement during project preparation. ADB will provide more training programs \nduring implementation. To mitigate the potential risks, financial leverage for JHG and JTPC should \nbe controlled below 80% and both companies should set aside a mandatory reserve in a separate \nbank account equivalent to 1% of their ADB loan amount. JHG and JTPC will report the status of \ntheir reserve account in their regular monitoring report. ADB rated the financial management risk \nbefore mitigation moderate. \n \n31.  Procurement risk assessment. An assessment of the procurement capacity of JHG and \nJTPC showed they have skilled and experienced staff and well-established procedures and \nsystems needed to manage procurement in a manner consistent with ADB\u2019s requirements.24 Staff \nfrom JHG and JTPC received three training programs during project preparation. JHG and JTPC \nhave experience in international competitive bidding for other projects financed by international \ndevelopment partners. They will also hire a qualified procurement consultant and a procurement \nagent to further strengthen their capacity to carry out ADB-related procurement. \n  \n32.  Corruption prevention. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained  to  and  discussed  with  the  government,  JHG,  and  JTPC.  The  specific  policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM.25 ADB conducted integrity \ndue diligence and did not identify any significant integrity risk.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n33.  Social benefits. The project will directly benefit 646,815 households or 1,988,011 people \nin the project area by providing clean heating and cooling.26 About 996,119 of the intended \nbeneficiaries are women and about 2,091 of the households are headed by poor women. In \naddition, the project will supply clean heating to educational institutions, hospitals, and elderly \ncare centers in the project area. There are about 35,860 children in 29 schools and kindergartens, \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n23 Financial Management Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 Project Procurement Risk Assessment Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n25 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n26 This is equivalent to 31.4% of the total population of Jinan city. \n ", "10 \nabout 440 patients and medical staff in 9 hospitals, and 729 elderly people and caregivers in 8 \nelderly care centers. The shift from dirty coal-based heating and cooling to cleaner and safer \ntechnologies supported by the proposed project will (i) reduce cases of respiratory diseases \nthrough improved indoor and outdoor air quality; (ii) reduce carbon monoxide poisoning by \nproviding safer heating and cooking fuel; (iii) provide a better medical environment by installing \ncleaner and more reliable heating services; (iv) improve living conditions through adequate and \nreliable heating services; (v) reduce fuel expenditure on heating and cooking by switching from \nindividual household coal-based stoves; (vi) provide a more comfortable schooling environment \nduring the winter by supplying cleaner and more reliable heating services; and (vii) increase \nincome through job opportunities created during construction. These benefits will contribute \ndirectly to Sustainable Development Goals 3, 5, 7, and 11.27 The government will provide \nsubsidies for the installation of clean heating systems under the project so that poor households \n \nwill be able to choose and install the affordable clean energy heating system free of charge.\n \n34.  Gender impact. Women in project sites have the main responsibility for the use and \nmaintenance of coal stoves and are disproportionally affected by the resulting in-door air pollution. \nBy switching the type of energy used in cooking and heating, the project will directly affect \nwomen\u2019s health outcomes. The project will enable the sharp reduction in time spent by beneficiary \nwomen on unpaid household work related to the preparation of household energy for heating from \na current average of 2.75 hours to less than 1 hour. This will allow more time for productive \n \nactivities and self-development, which could lead to increased income.  \n \n35.  The project is categorized as Effective Gender Mainstreaming. The project will (i) provide \naccess to clean heating for about 2,091 households headed by poor women; (ii) improve the \ntechnical capacity of JHG and JTPC women staff on the operation and maintenance of the new \nfacilities through training (at least 40% are women), (iii) ensure that women are employed in skilled \nand unskilled jobs generated by the project during construction and operation (at least 700 jobs \nfor women); (iv) conduct campaigns to raise awareness of the environmental and health benefits \nof clean energy (at least 40% of the participants are women); (v) ensure the participation of \nwomen in consultations during project implementation (at least 40% of the participants are \nwomen);  and  (vi)  ensure  that  the  design  of  services  is  gender-sensitive.  The  project  will \nencourage JHG and JTPC to conduct a corporate gender analysis, which could lead to the drafting \nof a corporate gender action plan for JHG and JTPC during project implementation. The project \nwill encourage JHG and JTPC to adopt an appropriate gender policy under its corporate social \n \nresponsibility program with support from the TA. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n36.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.28 \n \n37.  Environment (category A). ADB prepared an environmental impact assessment (EIA) \nand initial environmental examinations, including environmental management plans (EMPs) \nfollowing national environmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \nPotential impacts during construction, including noise and dust emissions, construction waste and \nwastewater, community and public safety disturbances, and risks to occupational health and \nsafety are mostly temporary, predictable, and reversible, and can be mitigated through the \nimplementation of the EMPs. Potential adverse environmental impacts during operation include \n                                                \n27 United Nations. Sustainable Development Goals. \n28 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories \n ", "11 \nSO , particulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter, PM ,and NO  emissions; noise; \n2 2.5   x\nsolid and hazardous waste; wastewater discharge; risks of fire and well blowout; and risks to the \ncommunity and occupational health and safety. JHG and JTPC will use low-NO  burners. Exhaust \nx\ngas will be treated by selective noncatalytic reduction denitrification system, magnesium oxide \ndesulfurization system, cyclone dust collector, and bag filter, and emitted through a 100-meter \nstack. The residual emissions will be offset by shutting down existing coal boilers and household \nstoves. Air quality modeling results show that the biomass-based combined heat and power plant \ncomponent will have negligible impacts on air quality. The implementation of the EMPs and \nadherence to national regulations will mitigate other impacts. Sensitive ecosystems will not be \naffected.  JHG  and  JTPC  has  allocated  sufficient  budgets  in  the  EMPs  to  ensure  proper \nimplementation  of  mitigation  and  monitoring  measures.  The  borrower  has  committed  to \ndeveloping an emergency response plan in case of fire and well blowout. JHG and JTPC will \nestablish an environmental and social safeguard unit under the project management office to \nimplement the mitigation measures stated in the EIA, initial environmental examinations, and \nEMPs. The project management office will hire an independent loan implementation consultant \nto support in implementing the EMPs. JHG and JTPC obtained domestic EIA approvals from \nrelevant environmental protection bureaus for all subprojects. \n \n38.  JHG and JTPC have carried out meaningful consultations with the public. JHG and JTPC \nhave agreed on a set of environment-related loan covenants and have committed themselves to \nparticipating in training programs that will place a heavy emphasis on environmental safeguards. \nADB disclosed the environment safeguard documents to the affected people and on the ADB \nwebsite.29 Potential environmental complaints or disputes will be handled following the grievance \nredress  mechanism  established  for  the  project.  JHG  and  JTPC  will  submit  environmental \nmonitoring reports to ADB semiannually during construction and annually during operation. The \npotential climate risks to the project components are high. ADB is conducting a climate risk \nassessment and will incorporate the findings of the assessment in the project design.  \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The proposed project does not entail permanent \nor temporary physical or economic displacement as (i) heat exchange stations will use existing \nspace in residential communities and buildings that is reserved for the construction of public \nfacilities; (ii) heating and cooling pipelines will be laid underground within the existing right of way \nor along roadways; (iii) the biomass-based combined heat and power plant will be built on existing \nstate-owned land that has already been acquired; (iv) geothermal and natural gas energy stations \nwill be constructed in the existing vacant and reserved space inside government buildings, \nresidential communities, and schools; and (v) clean heating facilities, such as heat pumps and \ndistributed natural gas boilers, will be constructed on the vacant state-owned land or in existing \nbuildings. ADB carried out due diligence for the associated facilities and for components where \nland acquisition had already been completed, and found no outstanding issues. \n \n40.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to have adverse impact \non ethnic minorities as the project site is not near any ethnic minority towns or villages. \n \n41.   Environmental  benefits.  Compared  to  traditional  coal-based  heating  and  cooling \nsystems, the facilities build by the project will emit about 90.0% less CO , 90.6% less NO , 96.0% \n2 x\nless SO ,and 87.5% less PM . The use of waste heat and renewable energy sources will reduce \n2   2.5\nthe annual consumption of coal by about 1.37 million tons. This will prevent the emission of about \n3.99 million tons of CO , 5,347 tons of SO , 4,536 tons of NO , and 1,430 tons of PM . \n2 2 x 2.5\n                                                \n29 ADB disclosed the EIA in the ADB website on 13 August 2018. \n ", "12 \nF.
