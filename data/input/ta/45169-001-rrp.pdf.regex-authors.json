I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation1 Corridor 3 (Bishkek\u2013Osh Road) Improvement Project, Phase 4. 2 \n \n2.  The project is located in the western part of the country where the income gap is \nsignificant. The  project will  improve  connectivity  and  reduce transport  costs  by  completing \nimprovements to sections of an important national and regional corridor, the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, \nwhich is part of Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Corridor 3. The project \nwill also help strengthen the sustainability of the national road network by improving road safety \nand road assessment management. 3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a landlocked, mountainous country with formidable geographic \nbarriers that constrain its ability to effectively participate in international trade. Its development \nefforts  are  further  hampered  by  inadequate  physical  infrastructure,  which  is  in  need  of \ninvestment and regular maintenance. Development of the transport sector is very important for \nthe Kyrgyz Republic as this will lower barriers, reduce the cost of doing business, and generate \nemployment in the region. \n \n4.  The capital, Bishkek, is the country\u2019s political and economic hub with a population of \nabout 1 million. The second largest city after Bishkek is Osh (population 250,000), located in the \nFergana valley in the south, the country\u2019s major agricultural area. The gross domestic product of \nthese two cities accounts for nearly half of the country\u2019s total. The Bishkek\u2013Osh road connects \nthe two regional economic and population centers, and in a regional context forms part of \nCAREC Corridor 3, which runs from west and south of the Siberian region of the Russian \nFederation through Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, \nand Uzbekistan to the Middle East and South Asia.4 In the national context, the Bishkek\u2013Osh \nroad represents about one-third of the core international road corridor network in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, and links the country to Kazakhstan in the north, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in the \nsouth, and the People\u2019s Republic of China in the southeast. It crosses four of the country\u2019s \nseven provinces and serves at least 4 million people. It is the only direct land link between the \nsouthern  and  northern  parts  of  the  country,  making  it  crucial  for  maintaining  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s social, political, and economic integrity.  \n \n5.  The complete rehabilitation of the Bishkek-Osh road will contribute to expanding trade \nand increasing competitiveness among the CAREC economies and the rest of the world. The \nproject road also passes through some of the poorest oblasts (districts) in the country with the \ngreatest need for improved connectivity for the population to access goods and services and so \n                                                \n1  CAREC is a proactive facilitator of project-based cooperation in transport, trade, energy, and other key sectors of \nmutual interest. It is a partnership of 10 countries and six multilateral institutions working together to promote \ndevelopment through regional cooperation, leading to accelerated growth and poverty reduction. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2012. Technical \nAssistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Preparing the CAREC Corridor 3 (Bishkek\u2013Osh Road) Improvement Project, \nPhase 4. Manila. \n4  ADB. 2007. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy. Manila. ", "2   \nimprove their quality of life. Two such oblasts are Osh and Jalal-Abad, both of which have urban \nand rural poverty rates of more than 40%.5 By improving the key corridor in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nthe poorest regions in the country will have improved access to regional and domestic economic \nactivities. Improving the road network, especially to connect rural populations to urban centers \nfor access to services and trade in domestic and regional markets, is critical for inclusive \neconomic growth and social development.  \n \n6.  ADB  has  assisted  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  in  rehabilitating  320  kilometers  (km)  of  the \n655 km Bishkek\u2013Osh road in three phases.6  All three projects were rated successful and highly \nrelevant in the performance evaluation report by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department in \n2010.7 Other development partners, such as the Japan International Cooperation Agency and \nthe  Islamic  Development  Bank,  also  recognize  the  importance  of  this  road.  Overall, \ndevelopment  partners  have  assisted  the  government  in  rehabilitating  more  than  539  km  \n(about 82%) of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.8 However, because of funding limitations, there are still \ntwo sections that need urgent attention: Bishkek to Kara-Balta and Madaniyat to Jalal-Abad. \nThese two sections are in very poor condition, with an international roughness index above 7 \nand truck and bus average travel speed of less than 50 kilometers per hour (km/h), and are \nunable to provide the required level of service. 9 They pose traffic hazards to road users and \npedestrian traffic.10 In addition to connecting the poorest population needing access to services, \ngoods, and markets and enhancing regional connectivity, upgrading the Bishkek\u2013Osh road will \nimprove safety for all road users.11  \n \n7.  The  project  will  improve  national  and  regional  connectivity  by  reconstructing  and \nrehabilitating an estimated 120 km of crucial road sections between Bishkek and Osh, and will \ninclude road safety measures such as road signs, lane markings, street lighting, parking areas, \nbus stops, crash barriers, and sidewalks. The project is fully consistent with the government\u2019s \npriority  of  upgrading  key  corridors  as  stated  in  the  National  Strategy  of  Sustainable \nDevelopment, 2013\u20132017.12 The project is also well aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 202013 and \nwith  the  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017,  for  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  (footnote  5).  \nThe priority theme for the country partnership strategy is the development of a successful and \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2013.

Manila. \n6  Phase 1 of the Bishkek\u2013Osh road project was completed in 2001, phase 2 in 2005, and phase 3 in 2007.  \nThe combined lessons include (i) long-term planning and proper sequencing are needed to reform the road sector, \nsufficient resources must be allocated for capacity building in institutions, and monitoring of reform implementation \nis needed; (ii) close coordination with development partners is needed to avoid conflicting policy advice; (iii) an \nassessment of affordability of road rehabilitation projects is needed in the economic analysis; and (iv) time overruns \nshould be avoided as they can undermine the project\u2019s efficiency and economic internal rate of return. \n7  Independent Evaluation Department. 2010.

In the \nBishkek\u2013Kara-Balta section, the 2013 average annual daily traffic between Km 9 and Km 17 near the Bishkek \nbypass junction is 42,000 vehicles, and between Km 17 and Km 29 near Sokuluk town is 48,600 vehicles. \n10 A sample pedestrian count was carried out on a typical weekday (Thursday, 20 June 2013) at Km 25.5 near the \nmarket area of Sokuluk. From 12 p.m. to 2 p.m., 4,064 pedestrians were counted on the sidewalk and 1,881 \npedestrians were counted at the crossing. From 5 p.m. to 7 p.m., 1,561 pedestrians were counted on the sidewalk \nand 1,052 pedestrians were counted at the crossing. Based on a conservative estimate, this section of the road, on \na typical weekday, would have at least an estimated 10,000 pedestrians passing by it. \n11 Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2013.

Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the project will be enhanced regional connectivity and trade via CAREC \nCorridor 3. The outcome will be improved efficiency and safer movement of goods and people \non the Bishkek\u2013Osh road.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The outputs to be financed by ADB and the government are as follows: \n \n(i)  Reconstructed  road  from  Bishkek  to  Kara-Balta  totaling  52.5  km  \n(Km 8.5\u2013Km 61.0). This includes 43.5 km of the road section to be upgraded to \nfour  lanes  and  9.0  km  to  six  lanes.14 Reconstruction  of  six  bridges  and \nrehabilitation of one bridge 6\u201324 meters long are also included. \n \n(ii)  Strengthened institutional capacity. This component comprises (a) a 100-km \nperformance-based maintenance (PBM) pilot contract, covering the section from \nKara-Balta to Km 161, and knowledge building and sharing relating to PBM;  \n(b) a road safety audit and awareness program; and (c) consulting services for \nengineering,  supervision,  and  project  management,  including  climate  change \nadaptation assessment and independent external resettlement monitoring.     \n \n10.  In  addition,  67  km  of  the  road  section  from  Madaniyat  to  Jalal-Abad  (Km  507.5\u2013 \nKm 574.5) will be rehabilitated to international and state highway category 2.15 This is to be \nfinanced by the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) and the government.16 \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n11.  The project is estimated to cost approximately $191.8 million, including taxes and duties, \nto be financed by ADB, the EDB, and the government. The project investment plan is in Table 1. \n \n                                                \n14 Based on the Kyrgyz Republic road design standards, Km 8.5\u2013Km 16.0 and Km 21\u2013Km 60 will be considered as \ntraffic regulated highways according to urban road standards (design speed of 80 km/h and 4\u20136 3.5-meter traffic \nlanes), whereas Km 16\u2013Km 21 section is located outside settled areas and should be categorized as an \ninternational and state highway of category 1-b (design speed of 120 km/h and four 3.75-meter traffic lanes).  \n15 As defined in the Kyrgyz Republic road design standards, the section will have a design speed of 100 km/h and two \n3.75-meter traffic lanes.  \n16 A framework cofinancing agreement was signed between ADB and the EDB on 6 May 2013. The agreement \ndetails the institutional partnership through a programmatic cofinancing approach by establishing operational \narrangements for planning and coordination. As part of the government's larger program for the Bishkek\u2013Osh road, \nit is expected that the EDB will concurrently provide a loan of $60 million equivalent to cofinance rehabilitation of  \n67 km of road from Madaniyat to Jalal-Abad (Km 507.5\u2013Km 574.5). In connection with such planned financing, on \n4  June  2013,  ADB  and  the  EDB  signed  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  collaborative  cofinancing, \nsummarizing the design, scope, components, and financing of the respective sections to be financed by ADB and \nthe EDB.  \n ", "4   \nTable 1: Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be the executing agency.  \nIt  has  implemented  all  development-partner-financed  road  projects  since  1995,  and  has \naccumulated considerable experience. The Investment Projects Implementation Group in the \nMOTC will be the project implementation unit responsible for project implementation activities. 19   \n \n16.  The Ministry of Finance is requesting ADB\u2019s consideration in procuring bitumen from \nnon-ADB  members.  Because  of  the  location  of  the  project,  countries  that  are  non-ADB \nmembers could provide better-quality materials at more competitive prices. Due to climate \nconditions in the Kyrgyz Republic, bitumen required for construction has to be able to endure \nextreme weather. Bitumen from neighboring ADB members often cannot meet this requirement. \nAllowing bitumen to be procured from non-ADB members will result in time and cost savings in \nthe civil works. 20  Therefore, to enable the government to source from the least-expensive \nproducers, and thereby maximize the project\u2019s development impact, economic efficiency and \nquality assurance, it is proposed that bitumen procured from non-member countries of ADB be \neligible for financing for use in the ADB-financed section. \n \n17.  The  implementation  arrangements  for  ADB  financed  and  administered  outputs  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual.21   \n \n   \n                                                \n18 Detailed cost estimates by ADB and the government can be found in Section IV of the project administration \nmanual. \n19 The  Investment  Projects  Implementation  Group  is  funded  by  multiple  development partners  such as  ADB,  \nthe World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. For the implementation of the  \nEDB-financed section, if additional staffing is required, EDB will discuss with MOTC to make further arrangements \nwhen necessary. \n20 An estimated $1.8 million will be saved by procuring bitumen from non-ADB member countries.  \n21 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6   \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangementsa \nImplementation period  February 2014\u2013October 2019  \nEstimated completion date  30 October 2019 (loan and grant closing date: 30 April 2020) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Ministry of Finance, deputy minister (chair); head of Public Investment Program, \nTechnical Assistance, and Foreign Aid Department (member); head of Investment \nProjects Implementation Group (member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(iii)  Implementation unit  Investment Projects Implementation Group, Bishkek, 29 staff (20 more to be recruited \nby 2015)  \nProcurement  International  One civil works contract  $75.5 millionb \n  competitive bidding  One performance-based maintenance contract  $5.0 millionb \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost- One engineering and supervision contract   $4.2 millionb   \nbased selection  (247 person-months)    \nLeast-cost selection  Financial audit  $0.1 millionb \nIndividual  One external resettlement monitor specialist  $0.1 millionb \nconsultants   Project management (1,350 person-months)  $1.3 millionb \nAdvance contracting  Engineering and supervision consulting services.

DUE DILIGENCE  \nA.  Technical   \n18.  Preliminary engineering designs for the Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta and Madaniyat\u2013Jalal-Abad \nroad  sections  have  been  carried  out  based  on  topographical  survey  data;  geotechnical \ninvestigations; and pavement, drainage structure, and bridge condition surveys in accordance \nwith  design  standards  applicable  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  internationally.  International \nstandards are applied partly to improve any shortcomings in the national standards so as to \nallow  for  a  more  flexible  approach  in  defining  suitable  solutions  at  individual  locations.  \nThe construction method will utilize proven technology with standard materials compatible with \nlocal conditions. Under the ADB-financed portion of the project, 9 km of the Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta \nroad will be reconstructed, climate proofed, and upgraded to six lanes, and the remaining  \n43.5 km will be upgraded to four lanes with asphalt pavement. For the EDB-financed portion,  \nthe existing two-lane Madaniyat\u2013Jalal-Abad section will be rehabilitated with asphalt pavement. \nImprovement of road safety signs, pavement markings, light and signal systems, and street \nfurniture are considered to enhance road safety. The two sections will follow existing alignments \nand  mitigate  accident  black  spots  to  comply  with  national  geometric  design  standards.  \nFeasible  adaptation  measures  will  be  incorporated  into  the  engineering  design,  \nthe  management  contract,  and  road  safety  measures  to  reduce  disruption  resulting  from \nclimate-induced events. Civil works will be strengthened on existing road pavements to improve \nroad capacity and to meet current and forecast traffic demand. \n \n19.  Analysis was also carried out on 10 feeder roads along the two sections as part of the \nfeasibility study to be considered for financing. Technical, economic, social, and safeguard \n ", "7 \nanalyses were conducted. 22 However, because of limited funding, the feeder roads are not \nincluded in the project financing at this stage. During implementation, if there are project savings \nor additional financing, these feeder roads will be considered and selection of the feeder roads \nwill be based on the findings of the feasibility study.23  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The project will contribute to lower transport costs, higher travel speeds, and improved \nroad safety standards for international and national traffic on CAREC Transport Corridor 3.  \nThe economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using the Highway Development and \nManagement  Model24 following  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.25  \nThe economic analysis compares the with- and without-project scenarios. The current pavement \ncondition was determined by engineering surveys. Values for vehicle operating costs and travel \ntime were estimated by updating recently completed studies, while maintenance costs were \nbased on the MOTC\u2019s actual expenditures on the project sections. Construction costs were \ndetermined by road section based on engineering estimates and traffic forecasts. The economic \ncosts are capital costs, including physical contingencies but excluding taxes, and operation and \nmaintenance costs. The economic benefits are savings in vehicle operating costs resulting from \nthe improved project road, and time savings. Historical traffic data were supplemented by \nadditional traffic counts and origin\u2013destination surveys to derive a base 2013 traffic estimate for \nindividual sections of the project roads and each of the feeder roads. The rate of growth in \ndemand for travel was set at 3.3% based on the growth in the last 2 years. The road sections \ncomprise only a small part of some journeys, but there is also local traffic for which the entire \njourney is within the project road sections.  \n \n21.  The project is economically viable with an estimated economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 26% for both sections combined. The estimated EIRR for the Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta \nsection to be financed by ADB is 27% and the estimated EIRR for the Madaniyat and Jalal-Abad \nsection to be financed by the EDB is 24%. The high EIRR reflects the poor state of the roads \nand high traffic volumes. Sensitivity tests confirmed that the project would remain viable even if \nthe envisaged project costs increase, or benefits decrease.26 \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  The Investment Projects Implementation Group has been implementing ADB-funded \nprojects since 1996, and has delivered more than 10 ADB road projects amounting to more than \n$300 million. The staff has adequate knowledge, understanding, and experience with ADB \nprocedures to manage the project. The implementation group has satisfactory capacity for \nproject financial accounting and a proven track record in ADB\u2019s disbursement procedures. \nUnder  the  ADB-financed  scope,  goods  and  works  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), civil works will be procured \nthrough international competitive bidding, and consulting firms will be recruited in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using \nquality- and cost-based selection, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10.  \n \n                                                \n22 Since feeder roads were considered during the feasibility study stage, an environmental assessment and review \nframework and a land acquisition and resettlement framework were prepared.  \n23  Feeder Road Selection Summary (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 World Road Association. 2002. HDM-4 Version 2. Paris. \n25 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n26 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8   \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and MOTC. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare  described  in  the  project  administration  manual  (footnote  21).  Under  the  \nADB-financed scope, bidding documents for the civil works contract will include provisions \nspecifying  ADB\u2019s  right  to  audit  all  project  records  and  accounts,  as  well  as  those  of  all \ncontractors, suppliers, and other service providers involved. Key measures to ensure proper \ngovernance are (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial \nstatements; (ii)  transparent  decision  processes  for  all  procurement  matters;  and  \n \n(iii) verification of contractors\u2019 payment claims by the supervising consultant and oversight by \nthe project implementation unit.27 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction by stimulating economic activities through \nimproved  transport  of  goods  and  people  and  access  to  services.  It  will  also  benefit  local \nresidents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction and reducing transport costs and \ntravel time. Social and poverty assessments are shown in the summary poverty reduction and \nsocial  strategy.28 The  project  is  classified  as  general  intervention,  with  no  direct  poverty \nreduction component. It will benefit poor people in the project area by improving transport \nconditions for better access to social services.  \n \n25.  Although there will be substantial demand for employment opportunities arising from this \nproject, there will be careful monitoring throughout implementation to ensure that core labor \nstandards are respected. The civil works contract will require that contractors (i) comply with the \nKyrgyz Republic\u2019s applicable labor laws and related international treaty obligations, and not \nemploy child labor; (ii) provide safe working conditions and separate sanitation facilities for male \nand female workers; (iii) provide equal wages to male and female workers for work of equal \nvalue; (iv) provide employment opportunities for women; (v) carry out road safety, HIV/AIDS, \nillicit drugs, and human trafficking prevention and awareness programs in workers\u2019 campsites; \nand (vi) construct toilets along the project road.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n26.  Environment (category  B). In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), MOTC submitted an initial environmental examination report including an environmental \nmanagement plan for the ADB-financed Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta road section, which ADB disclosed \non its website on 14 August 2013. 29 Public consultation was held on 10\u201313 June 2013.30 \nImpacts from the project are expected to be limited in magnitude, of a short-term nature, and \nmostly  related  to  construction  work,  and  can  be  mitigated.  The  identified  impacts  include  \n(i)  noise,  dust,  vehicle  emission,  and  vibration,  which  are  especially  significant  within  the \n                                                \n27 Details are in Section V of the project administration manual (footnote 23). \n28 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 For the road section between Madaniyat and Jalal-Abad (Km 507.5\u2013Km 574.5) to be financed by the EDB,  \nthe process for social and environmental assessment and planning, safeguard documentation, consultation,  \nand disclosure requirements was conducted to satisfy ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement. Initial environmental \nexamination report and land acquisition and resettlement plan for the EDB-financed road section were prepared \nand  disclosed.  The  EDB  confirms  that  the  social  and  environmental  assessment  and  planning,  safeguard \ndocumentation consultations, and disclosure during rehabilitation of the road section between Madaniyat and Jalal-\nAbad shall be undertaken to the EDB\u2019s satisfaction. During implementation, the EDB shall be responsible for  \n(i) ensuring that activities carried out in connection with its financed section comply with applicable safeguard \nrequirements, and (ii) resolving any complaints in relation to such section only.  \n ", "9 \nsettlements along the project road and where sensitive receptors such as schools, hospitals, \nand mosques are located; (ii) impacts on water courses and rivers due to bridge rehabilitation; \n(iii) impacts from material transport from borrow sites; (iv) impacts of tree cutting along the \nproject road due to site clearance activities; (v) impacts from asphalt plant and aggregate \ncrushers; and (vi) impacts from contractors\u2019 working camps. Impacts have been divided into \ndesign  phase,  construction  phase,  and  operation  phase.  The  cost  for  implementing  the \nenvironmental management plan will be financed by the loan and grant. Specifically, the costs \nof  mitigation  measures  will  be  included  in  the  construction  contracts,  and  the  cost  of \nenvironmental monitoring will be included in the consulting services of the engineering and \nsupervision consultants. Support to the Investment Projects Implementation Group in building \ncapacity in environmental management is not included in the environmental management plan \nbecause the implementation group is managing several transport projects under which capacity \nbuilding assistance has been provided. \n \n27.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  MOTC  prepared  a  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plan  (LARP)  for  the  ADB-financed  Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta  section  where \ncompensation for land, structures, and business interruption are detailed.31 Civil works under \nthe  project  will  entail  mostly  temporary  involuntary  resettlement.  Based  on  the  available \npreliminary design, the Bishkek\u2013Kara-Balta section will entail impacts on (i) two houses with \napproximately 10 persons that will be severely affected; (ii) 38 shops, cafes, or kiosks that will \nexperience temporary business interruption as these are mostly nontitled and will be moved \nback out of the existing right of way; (iii) two petrol stations, whose partial structures are within \nthe  existing  right  of  way;  (iv) a  government  structure  and  a  shed;  and  (v)  58  secondary \nstructures  (concrete  fences,  gates,  stone  paving,  etc.).32 The  LARP  was  disclosed  to  the \naffected people through a series of public consultations and was posted on the ADB website on \n15 August 2013. MOTC will be responsible for meeting ADB\u2019s safeguard requirements, including \nmonitoring of LARP implementation. Safeguard staff in the Investment Projects Implementation \nGroup has sufficient capacity to implement and monitor the LARPs. ADB will provide MOTC\u2019s \nsafeguard staff with further training through technical assistance.33   \n \n28.  Indigenous peoples (category C).  The project affects neither indigenous peoples nor \nvulnerable  groups.  General  positive  economic  and  social  impacts  are  expected  in  areas \ntraversed by the road sections.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  The  project  risks  are  considered  manageable  through  the  prescribed  mitigating \nmeasures.  Major  project  risks  and  mitigating  measures  are  summarized  in  Table  4  and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.34  \n \n                                                \n31 Resettlement Plan: Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n32 The LARP for the EDB-financed Madaniyat\u2013Jalal-Abad road section identifies impacts on (i) four houses with \napproximately 20 persons that will be severely impacted; (ii) 12 shops, cafes, or kiosks that will experience \ntemporary business interruption as these are mostly nontitled and will be moved out of the existing right of way; \nand (iii) 103 secondary structures (metal shade, gates, fences, etc.). There will be partial impacts to six houses and \ntwo shops. \n33  ADB. 2009.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n30.  The government and MOTC have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and financing document. \n \n31.  The government and MOTC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the financing agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n32.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR42,975,000  to  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  Corridor  3 \n(Bishkek\u2013Osh Road) Improvement Project, Phase 4, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft financing agreement presented to \nthe Board; and \n(ii)  the grant not exceeding $35,000,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Corridor 3 \n(Bishkek\u2013Osh Road) Improvement Project, Phase 4, on terms and conditions \nthat are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft financing \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \n33.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal in para. 16 of this report to permit \nprocurement of bitumen (i) in countries that are not (a) developing member countries of ADB, or \n(b)  developed  member  countries  of  ADB  that  have  contributed  to  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources; and (ii) that is produced in such countries. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n14 October 2013 \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption  \nEnhanced regional  Speed with delay  CAREC Corridor  Implementation of the \nconnectivity and trade  increased by 36% from   Performance  transport \nvia CAREC Corridor 3   37 kph in 2012 to 50 kph  Measurement and  infrastructure \n  in 2023 between Bishkek  Monitoring Annual  investment program \nand Osha  Report   as planned  \n     \nCrash rate maintained at  Ministry of Interior  Risks \nno more than 71.35   surveys  Vulnerability to \nper 100 million vehicle-   economic and \nkilometers travelled for  MOTC surveys  political instability \nthe CAREC Corridor 3     \n(Bishkek\u2013Osh road) by  Poor customs \n2023  procedures \n   \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved efficiency  Use of roads upgraded in  MOTC report  A functioning road \nand safer movement  the first full year of    safety monitoring \nof goods and people  operation increased to    system is \non the Bishkek\u2013Osh  2,057,000 average daily    implemented \nroad  vehicle-km in 2020     \n  (baseline: 1,430,000 in    Risk  \n  2013)     Rapid deterioration of \n    the road network \nReduced travel time  MOTC report  caused by insufficient \nbetween Bishkek and    funding for \nKara-Balta of 18%     maintenance and by \n(40 minutes) by 2020    weak axle-load \n(baseline: 50 minutes in    control \n2013)     \n     \nOutputs      Assumption \nReconstructed road  52.5 km of road  MOTC project  Continued \nfrom Bishkek to Kara- reconstructed with  progress report  government \nBaltab   pavement international    commitment to \n  roughness index reduced    improving road safety \n  to 3.0 meters per km by     \n  2020 (baseline: 7.0    Risks \n  meters per km in 2013)     Cost overruns caused \n      by unexpected \nInstitutional capacity  100 km pilot PBM  MOTC project  increases in prices of \nstrengthened  contract completed by  progress report  fuel and key raw \n  2020     materials  \n     \nRoad safety campaign  MOTC project  Low capacity of the \nimplemented by 2020  completion report  private sector in PBM \n   \n       \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \n  Road safety audit for all  MOTC project   \nphases (design,  completion report \nconstruction, and   \noperation) completed by \n2020 \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.
