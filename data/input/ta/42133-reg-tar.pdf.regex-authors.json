Asian Development Bank\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)1 \nhighlights the need to refocus on three development agendas, one of which is inclusive growth. \nRefocusing will entail promoting greater access to opportunities for the disadvantaged through \ninvestments in education, health, and basic social protection.2 The regional technical assistance \n(RETA)3 will  enhance  the  capacities  of  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  and  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff in designing and applying well-defined and focused strategies \nand operational initiatives in social protection. It will undertake research and support new and \nongoing initiatives to better understand what works under which conditions. Learning from the \nresearch and technical support will be disseminated through a communication program to raise \nawareness and support adoption of targeted social protection strategies and programs. The \nconcept paper was approved by the Vice-President, Knowledge Management and Sustainable \nDevelopment, on 8 April 2008. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  ADB  has  supported  social  protection  interventions  through  loans  and  technical \nassistance since the mid-1990s. It has been successful in facilitating policy dialogues and \nresearch as well as in disseminating information and knowledge on social protection and safety \nnets (especially during the Asian economic crisis). Recent research on the social protection \nindex (2008)4 provides policymakers with a tool to analyze and measure social protection and \nshows a complete picture of social protection in different countries. Strategy 2020 calls for ADB \nto  support  poverty  alleviation  through  a  strategy  of  inclusive  growth  that  emphasizes \n(i) increasing  economic  opportunities,  (ii)  broadening  access  to  these  opportunities, \n(iii) strengthening social protection and social safety nets, and (iv) supporting gender equity. \nADB must be prepared to meet this demand in coordination with other development partners \nand the private sector. This RETA aims to provide ADB a clear focus for responding to the \nsocial protection demands of its DMCs and to build ADB\u2019s capacity for responding to this \ngrowing need.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Strategy 2020 recognizes that the benefits of rapid economic growth are not reaching all \npopulation groups in DMCs proportionately. Large numbers of people are being left behind in \nterms of economic benefits and access to social services (footnote 1). DMCs are facing new \nchallenges in making socioeconomic growth more inclusive and equitable. They have raised \nconcerns  about  (i)  the  rapidly  aging  population,  (ii)  increased  internal  and  transborder \nmigration,5 (iii) urbanization that is growing by 5% annually,6 (iv) increasing costs of social \nservices that are barely affordable for low-income groups, (v) the rising exposure to natural \ndisasters and economic crises, and (vi) the looming food crisis. \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2   Social protection is defined as a set of policies and programs to reduce poverty and vulnerability by promoting \nefficient  labor  markets,  diminishing  people\u2019s  exposure  to  risks,  and  enhancing  their  capacity  to  protect \nthemselves against hazards and interruption or loss of income. It consists of five major elements: (i) labor \nmarkets, (ii) social insurance, (iii) social assistance, (iv) micro and area-based schemes to protect communities, \nand (v) child protection.

Social Protection Index for Committed Poverty Reduction, Volume 2. Manila.  \n5  In the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) alone, there are an estimated 120 million to 180 million internal and \n500,000 international migrants. \n6  By 2015, half of the population is expected to live in urban areas. \n ", "2   \n4.  Demographic transition in Asia requires building up safety nets for the elderly. \nDuring 2004\u20132025, it is estimated that the region\u2019s population will not only expand but will also \nbe reshaped by demographic shifts that may have significant implications for governments\u2019 \ndevelopment policies and spending on basic services.7 By 2030, it is estimated that more than \nhalf of working age individuals (20\u201359 years old) in the region will each be supporting two \npersons older than 60.8 Countries will be increasingly caught in a \u201cdemographic squeeze\u201d where \nthe elderly will be providing support to their still-surviving parents and yet will have fewer \nchildren to rely on.9 Overall, the share of Asia\u2019s elderly population is expected to triple between \nnow and 2050. The share of the elderly in the total population of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) will be 30% by 2050. This will be more than the total population of the United States. The \nhuge fiscal burden placed on the public pension and health care for the elderly is a serious \nconcern for the years to come.   \n \n5.  Migration  and  urbanization  erodes  the  traditional  family  support  system. \nTraditional  support  provided  by  families  and  communities  to  their  vulnerable  members  is \ndeclining and can no longer protect against major life changes. Without formal social protection \nmechanisms in place, sustainable growth will be difficult to achieve. Governments throughout \nthe region are adjusting their social policies and are increasingly emphasizing the formalization \nof support systems such as social insurance to reduce the vulnerability of their populations. This \nis particularly true for major recipients of ADB support, such as the PRC, India, Indonesia, and \nthe  Philippines.  This  is  also  true  for  developed  and  middle-income  countries  such  as  the \nRepublic of Korea and Malaysia, where there is potential for new partnerships with ADB, as \nshown during the Asian financial crisis.  \n \n6.  Social protection needs to address health risks. Expenditure on health is low. South \nAsia, for example, spends less on health than any region in the world, including sub-Saharan \nAfrica, at $26 per capita per year. Lack of financing possibilities in catastrophic health cases is a \nmajor reason for falling into poverty. A World Bank study10 finds \u201cnearly one quarter of people \nadmitted to hospitals in India were above the poverty line when they were admitted, but were \nbelow the poverty line at the end of their stay because of the health expenditures they incurred.\u201d \nHealth  insurance  coverage  is  limited  and  underfinanced  in  many  countries.  While  health \nprograms  are  increasingly  being  financed  through  government,  private  sector,  and  grant \ndevelopment aid, health system reforms are more and more becoming recognized as a major \nfocus of development in Asia. Increasing the public share in health financing and building up \nsustainable finance and health insurance systems are key priorities in the region.  \n \n7.  Social protection prevents poverty and contributes to achieving the Millennium \nDevelopment Goals. There is a broad range of social protection programs, and most aim to \nreduce chronic poverty. Social protection focuses on building assets of the poor, ensuring \nopportunities for them to use their assets more productively, and transferring cash or quasi-cash \nthrough social assistance programs (food transfers, food stamps, food price subsidies), cash \ntransfers (grants, noncontributory pensions), service subsidies (social housing programs, utility \n                                                 \n7  Felipe, Jesus, and Rana Hasan. 2006.

Washington, DC: \nWorld Bank. \n ", "  3\nsubsidies), and conditional cash transfers (CCTs).11 Among the range of approaches, CCTs \n(conditioned on child and maternal health practices and school attendance) are increasingly \nreceiving attention among policymakers and practitioners, based on evidence of their success in \nLatin America. Cash transfer programs are now widely supported (for example in Indonesia12 \nand the Philippines)13 as an effective mechanism to reduce poverty, as well as to help achieve \nseveral Millennium Development Goals. They encourage greater use of public services, such as \neducation and health, and provide vitally needed income support to poor households.   \n \n8.  Social protection and the current food crisis. ADB\u2019s recent report on the food crisis14 \nindicates that food price inflation severely stresses the most vulnerable groups. High and rising \nfood prices are threatening to reverse the gains in poverty reduction in the Asia and Pacific \nregion, undermining the global fight against poverty. If high food prices persist, the goal of \nhalving poverty by 2015 could be jeopardized. However, trade measures or price controls are \nnot efficient ways to combat the food crisis or food price inflation. These distort markets and \ncould exacerbate the situation in the international grain market. ADB has suggested that the \nbest way to address the immediate difficulty is to strengthen social safety nets through targeted \nsupport for the poor rather than generalized food subsidies, trade measures, or price controls.15  \n \n9.  Social protection helps mitigate environmental risks related to climate change. A \nrange of insurance and social safety net mechanisms help in mitigating environmental and other \nrisks, particularly as exposure to environmental, financial, and political shocks may not be \nautomatically  reduced  as  an  economy  grows  to  middle-income  status.  Unfortunately, \nvulnerability to risks and shocks remains high for a significant proportion of the population due \nto such factors as natural disasters (which are growing concerns in light of global warming).  \n \n10.  Making  social  protection  systems  more  efficient  and  inclusive  reduces  the \nfinancial  burden  of  the  poor.  Although  public  social  protection  systems  are  weak  in \ndeveloping Asia, such systems are available in most countries. However, those systems have \nlow  coverage  and  are  often  inefficient.  For  example,  not  more  than  25%  of  the  working \npopulation and their dependants in the region are covered by statutory social insurance, which \nmainly include old-age pensions and some health care benefits. With further extension and \nreform of statutory social insurance systems, coverage could reach another 5%\u201310% of the \nworking population. The increasing integration of markets and the competition offered by the \nprivate sector against inefficient government systems create opportunities to provide services \nmore flexibly and add reach in public\u2013private partnerships. Partner countries and subsovereign \nentities articulate massive demand for governance reforms and advisory assistance in the \nsector.  There  is  substantial  scope  for  more  private  sector  involvement  and  public\u2013private \npartnerships\u2014and particularly in social insurance.  \n \n11.  Gender  and  social  protection.  Gender  dimensions  in  social  protection  policies, \nstrategies, and programs are very important because vulnerabilities to risk vary significantly by \n                                                 \n11  De Janvry, Alain, et al. 2006.

Manila (3 May). \n ", "4   \ngender.  Understanding  and  incorporating  gender  issues  entails  more  than  tackling  gender \ndiscrimination: it brings about significant benefit for pro-poor growth. Attention to gender in \nprogram design can enhance the efficiency of social protection and ensure better protection of \nboth men and women. Hence, to achieve gender-equitable access to social protection services, \ngender issues should be an integral part of social protection policies, strategies, and programs.  \n \n12.  Facing this host of issues, governments throughout the region are adjusting their social \npolicies and increasingly emphasizing the need to strengthen or introduce formal and effective \nsocial protection systems to guarantee the security of their populations. Many of them are \nparticularly interested in learning from the experiences of other countries in Asia and elsewhere, \nas well as in being exposed to emerging, new ideas.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The expected impact of the RETA is more inclusive economic growth in DMCs from \nsupporting DMCs in developing and adopting social protection policies and programs. The \noutcomes are (i) increased institutional readiness of ADB in designing and implementing social \nprotection policies and programs, and (ii) enhanced ADB operations in selected areas of social \nprotection.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The  key  expected  outputs  are  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  demand  and  institutional \nresponse and capacities of ADB and its partners that will inform programming and designing \nefforts in social protection; (ii) operational recommendations for ADB\u2019s future support in selected \nareas of social protection, taking into account the comparative advantages of ADB and other \ndevelopment  agencies;  and  (iii)  awareness-raising  and  knowledge-sharing  activities  to \ndisseminate  knowledge  and  build  capacities  in  designing  and  implementing  policies  and \nprograms in selected areas of social protection. \n \n15.  Component 1: Assessment of Demand and Institutional Response. An assessment \nwill be undertaken of the current and potential demand of DMCs and the nature of this demand. \nInstitutional responses of ADB and other development agencies to social protection will be \nreviewed as well, highlighting the comparative advantages of ADB, social protection networks, \nand other development agencies while identifying areas where synergies can be achieved. The \nreview  will  focus,  in  particular,  on  the  areas  of  pension  reform,  social  insurance,  social \nassistance,  and  conditional  cash  transfer  programs.  Component  1\u2019s  outputs  will  be:  (i)  a \nsummary of past and current initiatives of ADB, other development partners, and DMCs on the \nselected areas of social protection; (ii) identification of major lessons learned, opportunities for \nADB  intervention,  and  potential  for  synergies  with  development  agencies  and  DMCs;  and \n(iii) operational recommendations for ADB\u2019s future support in the selected areas.  \n \n16.  Component 2: Support to New and Ongoing Initiatives. Component 2 will provide \ntechnical and operational support to social protection initiatives in DMCs. An initial list of social \nprotection initiatives from the following regions have been identified for support: (i) pension \nassessment and reform in Central Asia, (ii) capacity building support for national social security \nreform in Indonesia, (iii) support to the establishment and initial operation of the South Asia \nPension Forum, and (iv) capacity building support to Mongolia\u2019s social health insurance system. \nSelection  and  validation  of  support  areas  shall  be  finalized  in  consultation  with  regional \n ", "  5\noperational  departments.  Support  shall  include  technical  assistance,  workshops  and \nconsultations, advisory assistance, and expert inputs for designing and/or implementing priority \ninitiatives. Experience from this component will feed into and inform components 1 and 3.  \n \n17.  Component 3: Awareness Raising and Capacity Building. A communications and \nlearning strategy will be developed to disseminate findings and experiences from components \n1 and 2. In-country briefings will be conducted to share learning from the RETA\u2019s activities \namong DMCs and ADB staff. DMCs and ADB staff participation in international conferences \nand/or  training  on  social  protection  will  be  supported.  Online  or  other  networking  and \nknowledge-exchange  activities  on  social  protection  among  DMCs  and  ADB  staff  will  be \nfacilitated. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The RETA\u2019s cost is estimated at $1,000,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The RETA will be implemented over 18 months (August 2008\u2013January 2010). ADB will \nbe the Executing Agency through its Gender, Social Development, and Civil Society Division \n(RSGS) of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department and will be responsible for \noverall  management  and  monitoring  of  RETA  activities  in  collaboration  with  regional \ndepartments. Throughout the RETA period, RSGS will closely consult with and will be guided by \nregional departments and resident missions concerned. At least four projects will be included in \nthe RETA.16 The RETA\u2019s progress and outputs will be posted and updated regularly at ADB\u2019s \nsocial development website with links to social protection websites.   \n \n20.  The  RETA  will  require  an  estimated  34  person-months  of  consulting  services \n(3 international  consultants  with  expertise  in  social  insurance,  pension  reforms,  and  social \nassistance for a total of 12 person-months and 22 person-months of national consultants with \nsimilar expertise as the international consultants). The international consultants, in coordination \nwith regional operational departments, will lead the assessment and the operational support to \nDMC initiatives. National consultants will provide support to the international consultants and \nassist DMCs in developing and operationalizing social protection initiatives. All consultants will \nbe engaged by ADB as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. RSGS will set up a review and advisory panel that will include internal and external \nscholars and practitioners who will act as reviewers and advisors to the project during the \ncourse of the RETA. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Enhancing Social Protection Initiatives in Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n16  These  projects,  spread  across  ADB  operational  regions,  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with  operations \ndepartments on the basis of potential demand and the existing portfolio and pipeline. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nDesign  Performance  Assumptions \nSources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption  \nMore inclusive  Adoption of social  Feedback from  \u2022 DMCs\u2019 openness and \neconomic growth in  protection measures as  stakeholders (i.e.,  commitment to \nDMCs   components of growth  DMCs and regional  reform or expand \nstrategies in DMCs  operational  social protection \ndepartments)  programs \n   \nDMC development  Risks  \nstrategy and poverty  \u2022 DMCs\u2019 inability to \nreduction papers  finance social \nprotection measures \n \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nIncreased institutional  At least four DMCs adopt  Program designs and  \u2022 Resources to support \nreadiness of ADB in  social protection policies  policy papers adopted  DMCs in developing \ndesigning and  or programs    and implementing \nimplementing social    Policy dialogue, review  social protection \nprotection policies and  Increase in the number  missions, periodic  projects and activities \nprograms   and improvement in the  reports, and workshops  available in a timely \n  quality of projects and  manner  \nEnhanced ADB  programs supported by   \noperations in selected  ADB   Risks \nareas of social  \u2022 Weak institutional \nprotection  capacity to develop \n  and implement social \n  protection measures \n \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
