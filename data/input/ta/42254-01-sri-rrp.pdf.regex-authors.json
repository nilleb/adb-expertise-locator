I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Northern Road Connectivity Project. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Development of the \nNorthern Provincial Road Development Department, and if the Board approves the proposed \nloan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project is to rehabilitate about 140 kilometers (km) of provincial roads in Northern \nProvince and 170 km of national roads in Northern Province and North Central Province (NCP). \nThe project is timely and targeted\u2014to improve road connectivity in the country's conflict-affected \narea in the northern region, helping to restore access to basic social services and markets. It will \nfacilitate economic growth and contribute to reducing disparities in Sri Lanka, consistent with one \nof the government\u2019s key goals, which emphasizes equitable growth.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Northern Province is one of the worst conflict-affected regions in the country, emerging \nfrom nearly three decades of civil war. The damage to physical infrastructure has been severe \nand extensive. In particular, the road network lies in a state of total disrepair due to prolonged \nneglect and underinvestment. People in this region no longer have access to markets or basic \nsocial services as they once had and the transport of goods has dramatically slowed. Mobility \nbetween Northern Province and the country's southern region is also poor due to the substantial \ntravel time required because of the poor condition of the linking national arterial roads. This has \nhindered the spread of economic activities and development. Northern Province has one of the \nhighest poverty rates in the country. \n \n4.  The 140 km of provincial roads to be rehabilitated are in Mannar and Vavuniya districts, \nand comprise minor feeder roads connecting settlements with markets, and major feeder roads \nconnecting towns and villages. Ultimately, these roads connect to the main north\u2013south national \narterial road.2 The 170 km of national roads to be rehabilitated comprise 108 km connecting \nmajor provincial centers within Northern Province and 62 km in NCP. They will help link Northern \nProvince with major city centers in the country's southern region. The roads in Northern Province \nwill be rehabilitated to all-weather bituminous surfaces and will facilitate access to basic social \nservices, such as schools, hospitals, and local markets. The national link roads in NCP will \nreceive improved surfacing and marginal widening, which will reduce travel time and cost, helping \nto revitalize travel to and from  the north. Consequently, the improved road connectivity  will \nstimulate new economic opportunities. \n \n5.  The project has been designed in coordination with other development partners to ensure \nequitable geographic coverage and avoid overlaps,3 and complements ADB's recently approved \nsupplementary loan for the North East Community Restoration and Development Project II4 and \n                                                 \n1  Ministry of Finance and Planning. 2006.

", "2 \nthe  Conflict  Affected  Region  Emergency  Assistance  Project,5 which  focus  on  reconstructing \nNorthern  Province's  essential  physical  infrastructure,  schools,  hospitals,  and  administrative \nbuildings. These and other assistance program being prepared, 6 collectively, help ensure that \nADB assistance is provided in an integrated fashion and will effectively help the government to \nbuild capacity for sustainable social and economic integration. \n \n6.  The project is consistent with the strategic objective set out in ADB's country partnership \nstrategy (2009\u20132011): To improve the transport system in Sri Lanka, and promote regionally \nbalanced  and  socially  inclusive  economic  growth.  The  project  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan, Sri Lanka (2010\u20132012). \n \n7.  In conjunction with the project, an associated TA is proposed to develop the capacity of \nthe Northern Provincial Road Development Department (NPRDD) to effectively manage Northern \nProvince's provincial road network. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  In support of the country partnership strategy, the project impact will be balanced and \ninclusive growth in Northern Province. The project's immediate outcome will be improved road \nconnectivity within Northern Province and with the southern region of the country. \n \nC.  Outputs \n9.  The project outputs are (i) approximately 170 km of national roads in Northern Province \nand NCP are rehabilitated; (ii) approximately 140 km of provincial roads in Northern Province \nare rehabilitated, and selected bridge links are rehabilitated or replaced; and (iii) NPRDD offices \nare rehabilitated. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n10.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $173  million,  including  taxes  and  duties  of  about  \n$18.6 million to be financed by the government. The total cost includes physical and price \ncontingencies,  and  interest  and  other  charges  during  implementation.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates by expenditure category and detailed cost estimates by financier are in the project \nadministration manual (PAM). The investment plan is summarized in Table 1. \n \n11.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $130  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources  to  help  finance  civil  works  for  national  roads  and  recurrent  costs  for  project \nmanagement and consulting services, and a loan of SDR 16,080,000 ($24.4 million equivalent) \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance civil works for provincial roads, recurrent \ncosts for project management, and equipment-vehicles. \n \n12.  The loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and other \nsuch terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.

Although Sri Lanka's current annual gross national income per \ncapita (formerly gross national product) is above the eligible threshold,9 the government has \nrequested domestic preference under international competitive bidding to facilitate the country's \npost conflict recovery by encouraging participation of the domestic construction industry. During \nthe conflict period, the domestic construction industry suffered from limited opportunities and, \nmore recently, the fallout from the global financial crisis. Many contractors are facing a difficult \noutlook and there is a potential of losing permanent technical staff due to migration. As the \nreconstruction in the north begins, the government's priority is to ensure opportunities for the \ndomestic contractors who now have the necessary capacity as well as knowledge of local \nconditions. In support of the government's request, the project proposes to use a domestic \npreference  of  7.5%  in  evaluating  civil  works  under  international  competitive  bidding  in \naccordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).10 The \nproject's  eligibility  for  domestic  preference  is  being  proposed  in  consideration  of  the \nrecommended approach to engaging with Weakly Performing Countries (WPC).11 While Sri \nLanka is no longer considered a WPC, the country is emerging from a prolonged period of \nconflict and the economy of the northern region in particular does exhibit weak performance due \nto its post conflict fragility. The domestic preference will help ensure opportunities for local \ncontractors to recover and strengthen. It will also contribute to a harmonized approach among \ndonors, as the World Bank, which uses the identical eligibility threshold, is currently providing \nsimilar domestic preference for works for road transport projects in Sri Lanka. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n18.  The percentage of maintainable roads in Northern Province, although very small at \npresent, will rise in time as more roads are rehabilitated to maintainable conditions. Therefore, \nin conjunction with the project, capacity development TA will be provided with the objective of \nstrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  Northern  Provincial  Council\u2013Northern  Provincial  Road \nDevelopment Department (NPC\u2013NPRDD) to effectively manage and maintain the provincial \nroad network. This is consistent with lessons from ADB's previous projects on the need to \nensure that provincial road development departments or agencies strengthen their capacity and \nutilize a systematic approach for road asset management. To maximize effectiveness,12 the TA \nwill focus on NPC\u2013NPRDD, as ADB's other ongoing project13 is strengthening the capacity of \nthe Road Development Authority (RDA). The TA will carry out the following activities: \n \n(i)  Engage a TA consultant by June 2011. \n(ii)  Prepare  a  capacity  development  plan  by  September  2011,  which  includes \nimproved  organizational  arrangements,  optimized  staffing  allocation  and \n                                                 \n9  Current limit set in the World Bank OM (OP3.10 \u2013 Annex D) is $975 and Sri Lanka's annual GNI is $1,780. \n10  Bidding for the national road packages, which will be procured under international competitive bidding, will \ncommence upon ADB Board approval of the proposed domestic preference. \n11  ADB. 2007.

The management paper \nrecommends flexibility and relaxation of eligibility rules for procurement when operating in weak performing \ncountries or countries which exhibit evidence of weak performance such as in post conflict fragility.  \n12  Lessons from ADB. 2002.

The TA is estimated to cost $560,000, of which ADB will finance $500,000 on a grant \nbasis from ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV). The government and NPC\u2013\nNPRDD will provide the remaining $60,000 equivalent in kind. The government will provide \noffice space and NPC\u2013NPRDD will provide counterpart staff. The TA falls under category B as \nimplementation is expected to be relatively simple. The TA will provide required consultant \ninputs and necessary equipment14 and facilities. Renovation and upgrading of NPC\u2013NPRDD's \ndistrict offices in Vavuniya and Mannar will be financed under the loan. Individual consultants \nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.15 International consulting inputs of 12 person-months and \nnational consulting inputs of 16 person-months will be required. The TA will be implemented \nfrom January 2011 to December 2012. The details of the TA costs and activities, including the \nterms of reference, are in the PAM. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n20.  The engineering design has been carried out based on site condition surveys and field \ninvestigations,  optimizing  the  required  improvement  works  for  economy  and  construction \nefficiency  in  accordance  with  applicable  international  design  standards.  The  construction \nmethod will utilize proven technology with standard materials compatible with local conditions. \n \nB.  Economic \n21.  The economic assessment was carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.16 The principal benefits expected are in terms of savings in \nvehicle operating costs and travel time. The highway design and maintenance model was \nutilized to calculate vehicle operating costs and time costs with appropriate input parameters for \nSri Lanka. The estimated economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) range from 20.1% to 24.1% \nfor national road sections. The sensitivity analysis with adverse variation in project costs and \nproject benefits17 also indicates that the national road sections have an EIRR above 12% even \n                                                 \n14  One vehicle (double cap utility type) will be procured under the TA to carry out road inventory and condition survey.  \n15  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n16 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n17 Sensitivity factors: 15% decrease in project benefits (vehicle operating cost and travel time savings), and 15% \nincrease in project cost individually and in combination ", "    7 \nwith increased costs and reduced benefits. The EIRRs for provincial roads range from 12.8% to \n49.9%. The overall estimated EIRR for the provincial road component is 21.3%. The sensitivity \nanalysis of the provincial road component resulted in an EIRR above 12% in all sensitivity tests. \nA few of the provincial road sections, individually, may have an EIRR below 12% if there is an \nadverse  variation  in  costs  and  benefits.  However,  these  provincial  road  sections  provide \nessential accessibility to the rural and poor population in the interior areas. Based on the \nfindings  of  the  economic  assessment,  the  proposed  improvements  under  the  project  are \neconomically viable and sustainable, and are justified in social cost\u2013benefit terms. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Policy and legal. RDA, the implementing agency for the national road component, was \nestablished by the Road Development Authority Act in 1981. Under the Ministry of Highways \n(MOH), RDA is responsible for the development and maintenance of the national highway \nnetwork comprising the class A and class B trunk roads. RDA is headed by a chairperson who \nreports  to  the  secretary  of  MOH.  NPC,  the  implementing  agency  for  the  provincial  road \ncomponent, in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution,18 is responsible for the \ndevelopment and maintenance of Northern Province's provincial road network comprising class \nC and D roads. NPC\u2013NPRDD carries out the functions for planning and executing rehabilitation \nand  improvements.  NPRDD  is  headed  by  a  provincial  director  who  reports  to  Northern \nProvince's chief secretary through the secretary of MIDR. Northern Province was a conflict-\naffected region and still does not have an elected council, but elections are expected to be held \nvery  soon.  This,  however,  is  not  anticipated  to  affect  project  implementation  as  the  chief \nsecretary  of  Northern  Province,  who  is  the  chief  executive  officer  with  wide  provincial \nadministrative authority, will chair the project coordinating committee, which is responsible for \nmonitoring provincial project implementation. This is similar to the arrangement adopted for \nADB's ongoing project in neighboring Eastern Province.19 \n \n23.  Institutional capacity. NPRDD's capacity has been supplemented through the project \npreparatory stage with support provided by the ongoing ADB Road Project Preparatory Facility \n(footnote 8). NPRDD's capacity for implementation will be supported by the provision of a \nproject implementation consultant who will assist with the supervision of works. For long-term \ncapacity  strengthening,  a  piggy-backed  CDTA  will  be  provided  to  enhance  organizational \neffectiveness  with  respect  to  developing  and  maintaining  the  provincial  roads.  RDA  has \nsufficient capacity, past experience, and institutional strength to implement the project.20 \n \n24.  Financial management. Financial management assessment was carried out for the \nimplementing  agencies\u2014RDA  for  the  national  road  component  and  NPC\u2013NPRDD  for  the \nprovincial road component. RDA has prior and ongoing experience with implementing ADB-\nfunded  projects  and  has  satisfactory  capacity  in  terms  of  project  financial  accounting  and \nknowledge of ADB disbursement procedures. Within the project implementation unit for the \nnational road component, RDA will establish a dedicated project accounting and finance team \n                                                 \n18  An important milestone in the long-term solution to the conflict, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution attempts to \ndecentralize administration by devolution.

NPC\u2013NPRDD does not have recent experience with externally funded projects \nand necessary capacity strengthening will be carried out before and during implementation. \nWithin the project implementation unit for the provincial road component, NPC\u2013NPRDD will \nestablish a dedicated project accounting and finance team with suitably qualified accountants \ncomprising a project accountant and two management accountants. This team will be provided \nwith training and guidance by MLGPC staff who have practical knowledge of ADB disbursement \nguidelines and procedure. NPC\u2013NPRDD's capacity will be strengthened during implementation \nunder  the  capacity  development  TA,  by  implementing  a  financial  management  information \nsystem that includes accounting software, networked computers, and training.  \n \n25.  Both RDA and NPC\u2013NPRDD will establish and maintain separate project records and \naccounts to identify the financing resources received and expenditures made for the project, \nensuring an adequate audit trail. The government's Office of Auditor General will annually audit \nthe project accounts and related financial statements in accordance with international auditing \nstandards. To further minimize any risks, ADB's direct payment procedure will be utilized for \nsubstantial disbursement of payments for works, goods, and consulting services. \n \n26.  Procurement and anticorruption. Procurement of goods and works will be carried out \nin  terms  of  the  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  with  prior  reviews  by  ADB  at  key  steps  in  the \nprocurement process. The Bribery Act, No. 11 of 1954 (as amended), the Declaration of Asset \nand Liabilities Act, No. 1 of 1975, and Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of \nBribery and Corruption Act, No 19 of 1994, provide a strong legal basis to deal with bribery and \ncorruption. The Permanent Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption is \nconducting decentralized bribery-related investigations in Northern and Eastern provinces to \ncoincide with large amounts of post-conflict development assistance and investment. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment, executing agencies (MOH and MLGPC), and implementing agencies (RDA and \nNPC-NPRDD). The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.  Improving road access within the project area and connectivity to other provinces in the \ncountry are expected to develop and expand agriculture, fishing, commercial activities, and \nother  services.  The  beneficiary  group  includes  subsistence  farmers,  poor  fisherfolk,  small \ntraders,  and  other  services  providers.  The  project  will  have  positive  social  and  economic \nbenefits for all ethnic groups in the project area. The project does not have substantive gender \nissues as impacts and benefits will apply equally to men and women. The project will provide \nequally positive benefits for both genders in terms of improved access to schools, health care \ninstitutions, and other services. The contracts for civil works will include measures to ensure \nsafe and healthy working environment for both men and women laborers. The contractors will \nbe required to implement appropriate measures with respect to compliance of equal pay for \nequal work for men and women, health and safety at construction sites and labor camps, and \nawareness program for workers on prevention of HIV. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n1.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n28.  The project is categorized as category B in accordance with ADB's new Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). During the project preparatory studies and assessments, project strip ", "    9 \nplans, based on cross sections, were prepared and verified the project boundaries and limits of \nthe new construction. Based on this, the improvement works are envisaged to be within the \nexisting right-of-way boundaries. However, if a land acquisition requirement is identified during \nimplementation,  such  as  small  strips  of  land  adjacent  to  the  road  that  could  affect  some \nproperties, including boundary walls, business establishments, crops and trees, home gardens, \nor other resettlement impacts, the following steps will be taken; (i) assess whether any type of \npermanent or temporary displacement\u2014physical or economic or both\u2014will take place because \nof the project, (ii) formulate a resettlement plan in consultation with affected peoples and other \nstakeholders for approval by ADB and disclosure in accordance with the agreed resettlement \nframework and ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, and (iii) implement the resettlement plan. \nThe construction activities may proceed, after these requirements are met satisfactorily. The \nproject is not expected to have impacts on Indigenous Peoples and, therefore, is categorized as \nCategory C. \n \n2.  Environment \n \n29.  The project is classified as category B for the environment, and initial environmental \nexaminations  (IEEs),  in  accordance  with  ADB's  new  Safeguard  Policy  Statement,  were \nconducted for each of the identified roads. Based on the findings of the IEEs, the project does \nnot give rise to any significant adverse impacts that are irreversible, diverse, or unprecedented. \nAll impacts can be managed through the adoption of suitable mitigation measures, which are \ndescribed in the respective IEEs and environmental management plans (EMPs), which will be \nincorporated in the contract documents. Typical impacts associated with road construction work, \nsuch as dust generation, temporary disruption to traffic, temporary disruption of access to those \nliving in areas adjoining work areas, and soil erosion from exposed surfaces, can be mitigated \nthrough measures described in the IEEs and EMPs. The main environmental concern is the \navailability of suitable borrow and quarry sites within the project area. Most of the suitable sites \nare  located  outside  Northern  Province,  which  may  results  in  long  haulage  distances.  The \nimplementing agencies will ensure that sites selected as borrow and quarry sites will have \nsufficient material to cater to the project needs, while not compromising the requirements of \nexisting users within the area where the sites are located, and that haulage will be done along \nroads approved by respective local authorities to ensure that the roads have sufficient carrying \ncapacity for such haulage. While the project envisages using borrow and quarry sites already in \noperation,  if  any  new  sites  are  to  be  opened  the  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that \nmeasures described in the EMPs are adopted during selection and site closure, and relevant \napprovals from the respective authorities are obtained. The project road improvement proposals \nhave been approved by the Central Environmental Authority, and its recommendations were \nincorporated in the EMPs and bidding documents. The public were consulted during project \npreparation and consultations will continue throughout implementation. \n \n30.  RDA  is  responsible  for  ensuring  that  EMPs  are  implemented  in  the  national  roads \ncomponent.  The  Environmental  and  Social  Division  under  RDA  will  monitor  environment \ncompliance  by  the  contractors  on  behalf  of  RDA.  To  ensure  adequacy,  the  project \nimplementation  consultant  team,  including  an  environment  specialist,  will  supplement  the \nEnvironmental and Social Division\u2019s field monitoring. For the provincial roads, NPC, through \nNPRDD, will be responsible for ensuring implementation of the respective EMPs. Since NPRDD \ndoes not have adequately skilled staff, the project implementation consultant team, including an \nenvironmental specialist, will help NPRDD monitor environmental compliance. \n \n ", "10 \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  The integrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and \nmitigating measures are summarized in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n32.  The government, MLGPC, MOH, NPC, and RDA have assured ADB that implementation \nof  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the PAM and loan documents. \n \n33.  The government, MOH, and MLGPC have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreements and project agreements.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATIONS \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan of $130,000,000 to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for \nthe Northern Road Connectivity Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith  interest  to  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially \nin accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements \npresented to the Board; and \n(ii)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 16,080,000 to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Northern Road Connectivity Project from \nADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \n35.  I also recommend that the Board approve the proposal set out in paragraph 17 of this \nreport  that a  domestic  preference  of  7.5%  when  evaluating  civil  works  under  international \ncompetitive bidding be applied in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) for the Northern Road Connectivity Project. \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n17 May 2010\n                                                 \n21 Risk assessment and risk management plan (Appendix 2).
