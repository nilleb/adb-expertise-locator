The  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  (CSPU)  2004\u20132006  notes  that  poor \ngovernance and ineffective public sector management are the main development problems \nconfronting  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG).1  A  country  governance  assessment,  conducted  in \nOctober 2002, highlighted the pervasive and widespread corruption and absence of a culture of \ncompliance and transparency in the public service. During the visit, members of the Permanent \nParliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) inquired whether the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncould assist with institutional and capacity building, given the PAC's lack of technical knowledge \nand inadequate resources to actively play its role in improving accountability of the executive \ngovernment and senior public servants. A Fact-Finding Mission visited PNG from 24 to 28 May \n2004 to discuss the work undertaken by the PAC to date, and perceptions of its efficiency and \neffectiveness by senior public officials, civil society, and development partners. Representatives \nfrom the Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Finance and Treasury, development partners, and \ncivil society emphasized the importance of the PAC, and strongly supported the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA). During a follow-up visit in July 2004, the chairman of the PAC \nreiterated his support of the main thrust of the TA. \n \n2.  The TA complements initiatives by the Government, development partners, and ADB to \nstrengthen good governance, in particular the public expenditure review and rationalization \n(PERR) process. A PERR review mission in May 2004 noted that while there has been progress \nin restoring the integrity of the budget systems and institutions, further attention has to be given \nto  improving  accountability  mechanisms  and  oversight  institutions.  The  PERR  action  plan \nincludes a project on strengthening fiscal and governance oversight, which will provide a focal \npoint for the Government to coordinate activities and achieve synergy of various aid agency and \nGovernment initiatives. The ongoing ADB-financed Public Service Program2 is assisting with \nwide-ranging public sector reform, including improved management of the public service and \ndelivery of basic services, and building institutional capacity in the Auditor General's Office \n(AGO). The TA will build on and strengthen these initiatives. The TA's goals, purpose, and \nscope are summarized in the TA framework (Appendix 1).3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since its reconstitution after the 2002 elections, the PAC has been active in conducting \nhearings into public agencies' compliance with financial rules and regulations, using the Auditor \nGeneral\u2019s reports to Parliament. The hearings have received widespread publicity and public \nsupport.  Several  members  of  the  PAC  are  strong  champions  of  reform  and  advocates  of \ntransparent and accountable government. However, there are concerns that the inadequate \nunderstanding of the PAC members of their own mandate and scope of activities, the lack of \ndetailed  PAC  procedures  to  ensure  transparency  of  its  own  process  and  decisions,  and \ninadequate resources to support its research and activities may undermine the committee\u2019s \ncredibility over time.         \n \n4.  The functions of the PAC, set out in the constitution and under the Public Finance Act, \nare to examine and report to Parliament on public accounts, and on the control of and on \ntransactions  with  or  concerning  public  monies  and  property.  The  PAC  acts  on  matters \n                                                 \n1  For  general  anticorruption  efforts  see  also  Transparency  International.  2003.

Manila. \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 26 April 2004. \n ", " 2  \nrecommended by the Auditor General and can subpoena witnesses and take evidence under \noath. Because the AGO is not seen as competent or adequately resourced to carry out its \nmandate in a timely and comprehensive manner, the PAC is constrained in its efforts to hold \npublic officials accountable. For instance, as the AGO has a backlog of audits and reports to \nParliament usually 2\u20133 years (and longer) behind, actions based on such reports often do not \nlead to effective sanctions as these officials may have moved on or evidence has been lost or \nboth. Consequently, PAC members have sometimes focused on more current issues, which \nhave neither been reported to Parliament nor thoroughly researched. During the Fact-Finding \nMission, a senior public servant, while strongly supporting the work of the PAC, expressed \nconcerns that the PAC may thereby unintentionally become subject of legal disputes. \n \n5.  Currently  there  is  limited  exchange  of  information  and  communication  between  the \nGovernment and the PAC. The PAC does not always keep Government informed of its hearings \nnor of the subject matter considered in hearings. There is also no formal process for the PAC to \nmonitor follow-up actions by agencies to implement its recommendations. An efficient interface \nbetween the PAC, central agencies, and the AGO is important to enhance the effectiveness of \nthe PAC and, ultimately, public sector agencies. \n \n6.  The media in PNG has been very active in exposing cases of corruption. Several civil \nsociety organizations, such as the Community Coalition Against Corruption and Transparency \nInternational  PNG  section,  have  been  instrumental  in  raising  public  awareness  of  issues \npertaining to corruption. However, outreach beyond the capital district and to the communities \nmost affected has been limited (footnote 1). \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The  overall  objective of  the  TA  is  improved  accountability  and  transparency of  the \nexecutive government. The TA aims to assist the PAC to become more active and effective in \nexposing and following up cases of corruption and maladministration.  \n \n8.  The TA will have the following outputs: \n \n(i)  Within the first 3 months of TA inception, a report will be produced containing (a) \ngood  practices  of  PAC  mandates  and  activities  in  other  countries;  (b)  an \nassessment of the current legislative mandate of the PAC, and its weaknesses \nand  strengths  including  clarification  of  its  oversight  role  in  appointing  and \nmonitoring  the  performance  of  the  auditor  general  and  the  AGO;  and  (c) \nrecommendations  on  strengthening  the  terms  of  reference  and  legislative \nframework. The report will also include an annual and 3\u2013years' work program \ntogether with the necessary budget allocations. \n(ii)  Based on the assessments, a manual will be produced outlining procedures for \nthe PAC's hearings and special enquiries as well as a code of conduct. Seminars \nwill  be  conducted  for  various  target  audiences  to  familiarize  Members  of \nParliament  and  the  PAC,  relevant  government  officials,  and  senior  public \nservants as well as civil society with the clearly defined PAC terms of reference \nand scope of activities, and code of conduct. \n(iii)  The capacity of PAC staff and staff on attachment or seconded from the AGO to \ninvestigate, analyze and follow up cases brought to the attention of the PAC will \nbe strengthened through on-the-job training and learning-by-doing. ", "    3\n(iv)  Formal communication channels between the PAC, other watchdog institutions, \nand relevant central agencies will have been institutionalized by the end of the \nTA.   \n(v)  At least two special investigations on specific financial governance matters will \nbe  conducted  with  recommendations  on  follow-up  actions  and  improvement \ninitiatives. \n(vi)  Awareness among various stakeholders of PAC's role will be enhanced and civil \nsociety can constructively and actively engage with the PAC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will build on synergies, and coordinate all its activities with the ongoing PERR \nprocess, particularly the PERR project on improving fiscal and governance oversight, and with \nall other related governance initiatives by the Government, development partners, and ADB \nprojects.  \n \n10.  The TA will begin with developing terms of reference, code of conduct, and a manual of \nPAC procedures. The material will be used to guide the drafting of the Parliamentary Accounts \nCommittee Act, currently planned for end\u20132004. In addition, a report with a work program and \nbudget  will  be  produced.  The  development  of  the  annual  PAC  work  program  will  include \nidentifying  at  least  two  topics  or  cases  for  investigations  on  specific  financial  governance \nmatters relevant to the current governance environment in the country. Such studies can, for \ninstance, look at the appropriateness and effectiveness of the existing intergovernmental fiscal \nrelationship, financial management capacity of provinces and districts, and accountability of \nboards of directors and chief executives of government-owned enterprises to the Executive and \nParliament. The process will involve consultation with Members of Parliament, the AGO, and \nrepresentatives of Government and civil society. \n \n11.  Seminars will be conducted for Members of Parliament and the PAC, ministers, senior \npublic servants, and civil society including community groups. The training courses aim to (i) \nfamiliarize Members of Parliament with the scope of the mandate of the PAC and its procedures \nmanual, and (ii) raise awareness of the mandate of the PAC, among relevant central agencies \nand civil society. The seminars will use local facilitators, including domestic nongovernment \norganizations. \n \n12.  Special investigative studies will be conducted in close cooperation with and input from \ncivil society organizations. During the process, particular attention will be paid to transfer of \nskills in investigative research, especially to media organizations. \n \n13.  A good practice interface mechanism between the PAC and relevant central agencies \nwill be developed. The process will look at formalizing communication channels and methods to \nfollow up actions, and for reporting back. \n \n14.  The PAC will be assisted in developing and implementing a communication strategy, \nincluding  a  plan  to  raise  awareness  of  the  PAC\u2019s  mandate  and  functions  among \nparliamentarians, public servants, and the community in general. \n \n15.  The  lessons  learned  from  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  to  other  PACs  in  Pacific \ndeveloping member countries as good practice to be considered in their effort to improve \nperformance and effectiveness. \n \n ", " 4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $630,000 equivalent, comprising $409,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $221,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $91,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost on a grant basis, of which $300,000 will be financed by ADB's TA funding \nprogram and $200,000 by the Government of Australia. The Government of PNG will finance \nthe remaining $130,000 equivalent of the local currency costs for counterpart staff salaries, \noffice accommodation, and transport. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The PAC will be the Executing Agency of the TA. At the start of implementation one lead \nconsultant (international) will be recruited for 6 person-months on an intermittent basis. One \ndomestic  consultant  will  be  engaged  for  3  person-months  to  develop  and  implement  a \ncommunication strategy. Two international consultants will be recruited for 15 person-months on \nan intermittent basis during the course of the TA. Outline terms of reference for the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. During the first 2 months of implementation, the lead consultant will, in close \nconsultation  with  the  PAC,  develop  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  two  international \nconsultants. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will be engaged individually.  \n \n18.  The TA will allow for the purchase of up to three computers, along with printers and \nstandard software to be allocated to the office of the PAC. The equipment will be purchased in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement and procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n19.  The TA will be executed over 26 months, and is expected to start in November 2004 and \nbe completed by December 2006. Implementation will be based on a process approach, with \nflexibility maintained to meet adjusting priorities and needs. \n \n20.  Overall reporting responsibilities are with the lead consultant. Within 1 month of TA \ninception, the lead consultant will submit an inception report outlining the work program for the \nTA. After 3 months, an initial report containing (a) good practices of PAC mandates, (b) an \nassessment  of  the  current  legislative  mandate  of  the  PAC,  and  (c)  recommendations  on \nstrengthening the terms of reference and legislative framework will be submitted. The report will \ninclude an annual and a 3\u2013years' work program for the PAC together with the necessary budget \nallocations as well as details of the consultative process used. Subsequent progress reports will \nbe submitted after 9 months and 15 months of TA inception, with input from the specialist \nconsultants. The final report containing lessons learned will be produced at the end of TA \nimplementation. Implementation will be based on a process approach, with flexibility maintained \nto meet adjusting priorities and needs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Papua New ", "    5\nGuinea for Strengthening the Capacity of the Parliamentary Accounts Committee, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \nImproved  Public expenditure  Asian Development \naccountability and  review and  Bank (ADB) review, \ntransparency of the  rationalization  consultation with \nexecutive  (PERR) process  development partners, \ngovernment  strengthened through  Government and civil \n  improved oversight  society \ninstitutions   \n  Auditor General's \nreports \n \nPurpose       \nMake the  Increased number of  ADB staff review  Risk: Parliament may not \nParliamentary  inquiries and follow-   be committed to adequate \nAccounts Committee  up to PAC findings    budgetary allocations to \n(PAC) active and      PAC. \neffective  Enhanced public  ADB consultation with   \n  awareness of PAC  civil society, review of  Assumption (A): \n  activities and active  media coverage  Government continues to \n  and constructive  be committed to PERR \nengagement between  recommendations \nPAC and   \nstakeholders  A: Capacity of Auditor \n  General's Office (AGO) \nIncreased and more  and independence of \nanalytical media  office strengthened \nreporting of PAC   \nhearings  \n \nOutputs       \n(i) Report containing  Report produced  Lead consultant's report   \nassessment of good  within 3 months of     \npractices of PACs,  technical assistance     \ncurrent legislative  (TA) inception     \nmandate of PAC, and       \nrecommendations on       \nstrengthening terms       \nof reference       \n       \n(ii) Annual and 3\u2013  Manual followed by  Lead consultant's   \nyears' work program  PAC members by  report,   \nfor PAC including  end of TA   ADB review, and   \nrequired budget    feedback from PAC   \nallocations       \n       \nContinued on next page", "Appendix 1  7\n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n(iii) Procedures  Developed within first  Lead consultant's report   \nmanual including  3 months of TA     \ncode of conduct for       \nPAC       \n       \n(iv) Capacity of PAC  Better quality of PAC  Lead consultant's   \nstaff to investigate,  reporting and follow- report,   \nanalyze and follow up  up actions  ADB review, and   \ncases strengthened    feedback from civil   \nthrough on-the-job    society and government   \ntraining and learning-   agencies   \nby-doing       \n       \n(v) Formal  Communication  Lead consultant's  A: Government continues \ncommunication   channels  report,  to be committed to PERR \nchannels between  institutionalized by  ADB review, and  recommendations and to \nPAC, other watchdog   end of TA  feedback from civil  strengthening oversight \nInstitutions, and     society and government  institutions \nrelevant central     agencies   \nagencies       \ninstitutionalized        \n     \n(vi) At least two  Special investigations  Lead consultant's \nspecial investigations  completed, discussed  report, \non specific financial  by PAC, and follow- ADB review, and \ngovernance matters  up actions initiated by  feedback from PAC \nconducted with  end of TA   \nrecommended follow-    \nup actions     \n     \n(vii) Awareness  Review of media reports \namong various  and feedback from civil \nstakeholders of  society \nPAC's role enhanced, \nand civil society \nengagement with \nPAC constructive and \nactive \n \nActivities       \n(i) Develop terms of  Completed within 3  Lead consultant's report \nreference, code of  months of TA  ADB review \nconduct of PAC in  inception and   \nconsultation with  acceptance of terms   \nstakeholders  of reference by PAC   \n     \n(ii) Develop work  Completed within 3   \nContinued on next page\n ", " 8 Appendix 1 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nprogram and budget  months of TA   \n  inception   \n     \n(iii) Review PAC  Completed within 3  Lead \nmandates in other  months of TA  consultant's report \ncountries, hold  inception and  ADB review \nconsultations with  acceptance of   \nPAC and develop  manual by PAC   \nprocedures manual     \n     \n(iv) Hold seminars for  At least 3 workshops  TA progress report \nMembers of  for PAC, Members of  Feedback from \nParliament, PAC,  Parliament;
