INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been assisting the Government of India\u2019s \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) program to meet the country\u2019s large infrastructure needs. The \ngovernment\u2013ADB initiative has been an evolving and structured step-wise approach, supported \nthrough a series of technical assistance (TA) projects designed to mainstream PPPs in the \ncountry.1 Following a joint review by the government and ADB of this first phase of ADB support \nto the government in November 2013, the government requested ADB for a new TA to further \nthe PPP agenda.2 Subsequently, ADB and the government held consultations to discuss the TA \nscope. The TA concept was approved by ADB on 7 October 2014.3 The government and ADB \nagreed on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The proposed TA is in line with (i) India\u2019s \nTwelfth Five Year Plan, 2012\u20132017;4 and (ii) ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017, \nfor India.5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Accelerated development of quality infrastructure is necessary for removing key supply \nconstraints on growth and promoting sustainable and inclusive growth. Accordingly, India\u2019s \nTwelfth  Plan  is  continuing  with  the  emphasis  on  infrastructure  development  and  aims  to \nincrease investment in infrastructure from about 7.2% of gross domestic product  achieved \nduring the Eleventh Five Year Plan, 2007\u20132012, to 9.0% of gross domestic product by the end \nof the Twelfth Plan.6 As per government estimates, this would require an investment of about $1 \ntrillion during 2012\u20132017. With constraints on public financing of infrastructure due to the limits \non fiscal space, the government\u2019s strategy for meeting investment requirements continues to be \nencouraging private sector participation, including through various forms of PPPs. During the \nTwelfth Plan, 48% of infrastructure financing needs are targeted to come from the private sector, \ncompared with about 37% in the Eleventh Plan. The new central government, formed in May \n2014, has reaffirmed the importance of PPPs for infrastructure. \n \n3.  Government  of India\u2013ADB  public\u2013private  partnership initiative. The government \nhas been promoting PPPs as an effective modality for bringing in private sector investment as \nwell as for efficiencies in assets creation and quality public services delivery. In a joint initiative \nwith  the  government  that  began  in  2006,  ADB  has  been  providing  comprehensive  and \nstructured support to the government\u2019s efforts to mainstream PPPs through a series of eight TA \nprojects  totaling  about  $17  million.  The  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  PPP  cell, \nMinistry of Finance, has been the key counterpart agency and executing agency for most of the \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2006.

The  TA  projects  have  provided  support  for  (i)  improving  the  PPP  enabling \nenvironment through assistance with policies, processes, and entities; (ii) building the capacity \nof PPP cells in selected states and central line ministries; (iii) developing PPP pilot projects in \nchallenging sectors; and (iv) developing the scheme and pilot projects for provision of urban \namenities in rural areas. \n \n4.  Key achievements. The TA projects have contributed significantly to the government\u2019s \ninitiative for mainstreaming PPPs. The projects have helped (i) draft key documents including, \namong others, PPP policy, PPP rules, \u201c3P India\u201d business plan (a proposed corporate entity for \nsupporting PPPs), PPP manual, PPP compendium, and Greenbook for PPPs in the health \nsector; (ii) support PPP cells in 16 states and 7 central line ministries through training officials \nwithin  sector  departments  at  state  governments  and  central  line  ministries,  reviewing  and \nstructuring PPP projects, developing state-specific PPP enabling frameworks and knowledge \nproducts\u2014such as the states\u2019 project development fund and viability gap funding (VGF) scheme \nbased on the central-level frameworks, PPP policies, guidelines, toolkits, and case studies\u2014and \ndeveloping and maintaining PPP websites and databases; (iii) support the DEA PPP cell in its \nfocal role for PPPs at the central level; and (iv) originate and structure about 25 pilot PPP \nprojects for bidding in challenging sectors. \n \n5.  Continuing challenges. The TA projects have enhanced the acceptance of PPPs by \ncreating awareness, building capacity, and strengthening the enabling environment including \nthe policy and regulatory framework. The support has also been catalytic in building a pipeline \nof PPP projects across assisted states. However, notwithstanding the successes, experiences \nunder the projects have shown the following main challenges which have served as the key \nlessons: (i) the varying level of PPP institutionalization in state governments, and the need for \nincreased focus on creating a sustainable institutional setup within state governments to carry \nforward  PPP  activities;  (ii)  the  issue  of  sustainability  and  mainstreaming  the  capacity  of \ngovernment officials mandated to promote PPPs; (iii) the inadequate shelf of bankable projects; \n(iv) the need for intensive and protracted follow-up to ensure assistance and structuring support \neventually translate in actual projects; (v) the emerging regulatory and policy gaps; (vi) the \ncomplex management and administration of the support required by ADB, in particular to the \nmany PPP cells through multiplicity of consultants; and (vii) the evolving PPP landscape across \nthe country that requires flexibility in TA support to address requirements of public sector \nauthorities, as projects are at various stages of PPP implementation and processing. \n \n6.  Government of India\u2019s request. The government has requested ADB for a new TA \nsupport, as outlined below, that builds on the experiences and lessons from the first phase of \nthe government\u2013ADB PPP initiative and helps address continuing and emerging challenges to \nensure long-term impact.  \n(i)  Six regional hubs. PPP experts in six regional hubs housed in PPP cells of \nselected  states  and/or  central  line  ministries  will  provide  focused  support  to \nselected states and central line ministries with emphasis on delivery of projects. \nThe locations of the regional hubs will be decided by TA inception. DEA and \nselected  states  and  central  line  ministries  will  sign  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding (MOU) for prototype PPP cell support under the TA that includes, \namong others, deliverables under the support to be provided. Under the TA, \nbased  on  experiences  with  the  initial  prototype  PPP  cell  model, \nrecommendations for improvements to the MOU for future prototype PPP cell will \nbe developed. The PPP experts, one in each of the six regional hubs, will help \nimplement  institutional  structures  and  mechanisms  for  a  prototype  PPP  cell, \n ", "  3 \nstrengthen the enabling environment for PPPs, and develop and deliver PPP \nprojects. \n(ii)  Risk  Appraisal  Unit  and  Policy  and  Project  Unit  at  the  Department  of \nEconomic Affairs. At the central level, the TA will support the DEA PPP cell to \ncontinue its crucial role of structuring and appraising new PPP projects under its \nRisk  Appraisal  Unit  and  of  supporting  a  PPP-enabling  environment  through \nactivities under its Policy and Project Unit. The TA will assist the Risk Appraisal \nUnit  in  appraisals  and  risk  evaluation  of  PPP  projects  for  approvals  by  the \ngovernment\u2019s Public\u2013Private Partnership Appraisal Committee, possible support \nunder  VGF,  and  possible  structuring  support  under  the  India  Infrastructure \nProject Development Fund. The TA will assist the Policy and Project Unit by \nadvising on policy matters and developing frameworks for emerging challenging \nareas, such as framework for risk valuation and contingent liability planning, and \nforeign direct investment in infrastructure. The TA will also support the Policy and \nProject Unit\u2019s project management functions. Five experts will support the Risk \nAppraisal Unit, and four experts with varied expertise will support the Policy and \nProject Unit. \n(iii)  3P Transition Cell at the Department of Economic Affairs. In its budget for \n2014\u20132015  budget,  the  government  announced  establishing  3P  India  with  a \ncorpus of about $83 million to provide institutional support for mainstreaming \nPPPs. 3P India\u2019s functions will include (i) providing support to project authorities \nin identifying projects, creating PPP pilot structures, and developing a pipeline of \nbankable  PPP  projects  with  support  for  oversight  and  scrutiny  of  projects\u2019 \nbankability; (ii) giving inputs to the government on policy; (iii) providing support \nfor advocacy and capacity building; (iv) assisting government entities to prepare \nguidance material on PPPs; (v) advising project sponsors in  project reviews \nbefore bid processes; (vi) assisting to market PPP projects; (vii) and assisting \nwith project implementation and contract management. The TA will help DEA\u2019s \n3P Transition Cell transition activities to 3P India, which will be a sustainable \nmodel for providing long-term support for PPPs. Three of the experts supporting \nthe Risk Appraisal Unit and one expert supporting the Policy and Project Unit will \nassist the 3P Transition Cell. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA has been designed to address the government\u2019s request taking into account the \ncontinuing  and  emerging  challenges  and  the  lessons  learnt.  The  impact  will  be  increased \navailability of infrastructure through PPPs. The outcome will be improved public sector capacity \nto develop and implement infrastructure PPP projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will achieve the outcome by supporting the following four outputs: \n(i)  Transition to 3P India supported. The DEA PPP cell envisages that 3P India, \nannounced in the government budget for 2014\u20132015 for mainstreaming PPPs, \nwill be set up in about 1 year. The TA will deliver the plan for support to the \ngovernment for transitioning to 3P India comprising developing guidelines and/or \nmanuals wherever required, assessing staffing needs, developing a recruitment \nplan, and providing capacity building support to government officials. \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Prototype  public\u2013private  partnership  cells  developed.  DEA  will  develop, \nfinalize, and sign an MOU for prototype PPP cells at the states and/or central line \nministries,  with  at  least  four  states  and/or  central  line  ministries  out  of  six \nenvisaged regional hubs by June 2015, and will sign an MOU for additional \nsupported prototype PPP cells by March 2016, assuming the TA letter is signed \nby January 2015. The TA will support at least six states and/or central line \nministries. The  MOUs  will  first  be  signed  with  the  states  and/or  central  line \nministries that will serve as regional hubs for other states and/or central line \nministries.  The  TA  will  assist  in  developing  prototype  PPP  cells  that  would \nsupport  PPP  project  development  and  provide  a  replicable  model  for \ninstitutionalizing PPP activities in state governments and central line ministries. \nThe  TA  will  help  prototype  PPP  cells  strengthen  institutional  structures  and \nmechanisms  and  build  a  PPP  enabling  environment\u2014including  processes, \npolicies, project development funds, and capacities\u2014in the respective state or \ncentral line ministry, depending on the needs of the state or central line ministry, \nwhich would support development of bankable projects. Further, with a focus on \nproject delivery, the TA will help develop project concepts, structure projects, and \nsupport the bid process, as required, so that projects are processed or ready for \nstructuring  and  project development  support (depending  on  the  development \nstage of the PPP framework and processes at the state or central line ministry at \nTA commencement). Recommendations for improvements to MOU for prototype \nPPP cells\u2014based on experiences with the prototype PPP cells and including \nelements to strengthen monitoring of deliverables\u2014will be finalized, and required \nelements for a prototype PPP cell delineated, by TA closing. \n(iii)  Appraisals  and  risk  evaluation  of  public\u2013private  partnership  projects \nfacilitated. The TA will support the Risk Appraisal Unit to expeditiously carry out \nthe  analytical  and  appraisal  work  of  PPP  projects  within  the  government\u2019s \nprescribed  timelines  for  approvals  by  the  government  under  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership  Appraisal  Committee,  VGF,  and  the  India  Infrastructure  Project \nDevelopment Fund, which will lead to a faster creation of a project pipeline for \nbidding out or structuring. \n(iv)  Public\u2013private  partnership  enabling  frameworks  and  tools  developed. \nBased on the emerging challenges and requirements, the TA will develop at least \ntwo key policy and/or analytical works at the central level, as found relevant by \nDEA.  These  could  be,  for  instance,  a  framework  for  risk  evaluation  and \ncontingent liability planning, toolkit for foreign director investment in PPPs, or \nneeds assessment and implementation plan for sustainable operationalization of \na  PPP  management  information  system  at  the  central  and  state  level. \nAdditionally, the TA will develop a PPP capacity-building needs assessment for \ngovernment functionaries, particularly at the state and local level, with action plan \nfor further development of PPPs; and a PPP framework and/or toolkit for assisted \nstates, where required, with recommendations for enhancing the PPP agenda \nbased  on  a  review  of  the  existing  state  institutional  and  regulatory  PPP \nframework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.9 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and logistical \n ", "  5 \nand administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  DEA will be the executing agency and will oversee TA implementation. ADB will be \nresponsible for the overall TA management, working closely with the DEA PPP cell. \n \n11.  The TA will require a total of 244 person-months of national consulting services, of which \n180 person-months will be through a firm with about 10 experts (all continuous) and 64 person-\nmonths will be through five individual experts (three continuous and two intermittent). ADB will \nrecruit the consulting firm using quality- and cost-based selection (quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10) on \nthe basis of bio-data technical proposal. The 90:10 ratio is proposed taking into account that \nPPP expertise is still relatively scarce and specific technical skills, experience, and knowledge \nare required for effective TA implementation. The consulting firm experts will include (i) one PPP \nexpert and project coordinator (team leader) at the Policy and Project Unit; (ii) six PPP experts, \none at each of the six regional hubs; (iii) two appraisal and risk evaluation specialists at the Risk \nAppraisal Unit; and (iv) one management information system expert at the Policy and Project \nUnit. The three individual consultants on a continuous basis will be appraisal and risk evaluation \nspecialists at the Risk Appraisal Unit. The two individual consultants on an intermittent basis will \nbe one legal expert and one policy expert supporting the Policy and Project Unit. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Consultants will be recruited in line with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The TA \nproceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n12.  The government and the participating state governments and central line ministries will \nprovide  the  office  space,  furniture,  and  logistical  and  administrative  support  necessary  for \nproject  implementation.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  30  months,  with  expected \ncommencement in January 2015 and completion in June 2017. Consultants engaged under the \nTA will carry out monitoring and evaluation under the supervision of the DEA PPP cell and ADB. \nThe team leader of the consulting firm will prepare a framework for monitoring the PPP experts \nsupporting the prototype PPP cells, taking into account the MOU and TA deliverables, and will \nmonitor and provide regular feedback and reports on the PPP cell experts\u2019 activities and outputs. \nThe team leader, based on inputs from various experts under the TA and a survey of key \nsponsoring authorities, will also provide consolidated inputs for evaluating the outcome. In \naddition, based on inputs from all consultants, the team leader will submit quarterly TA progress \nreports  to  the  DEA  PPP  cell  and  ADB.  Workshops  may  be  conducted,  as  required,  to \ndisseminate TA outputs, such as knowledge products, and findings and recommendations on \nelements of prototype PPP cells. Knowledge products may also be disseminated electronically \non the websites of DEA, participating state governments, and central line ministries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  India  for  Supporting  Public\u2013Private  Partnerships  for  Infrastructure \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased availability  By 2020, private investment  Government   \nof infrastructure  accounts for 48% of total  infrastructure  Improved enabling \nthrough PPPs  infrastructure investment   reports, annual  environment and \n(baseline: private sector  economic survey of  delivery mechanisms for \ninvestment at 37% of total  India  infrastructure \ninfrastructure investment in the    investment, including \nEleventh Five-Year Plan, 2007\u2013 Reserve Bank of  private sector \n2012)  India banking  investment \nsurvey, and annual \nreports \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved public  By 2017, \u201c3P India\u201d (a proposed  For all indicators:   \nsector capacity to   institution for supporting PPPs)    Sustained government \nfully operational in supporting \ndevelop and  Reports of the  support towards 3P \nmainstreaming of PPPs \nimplement  Government of  India initiative and \n \ninfrastructure PPP  India and state  timely actions taken; \nBy 2017, at least one bankable \nprojects  pipeline PPP project from each  governments  continued commitment \nof the assisted prototype PPP    from participating state \ncells proposed or prepared  Project  governments and \n  management  central line ministries \nBy 2017, at least 70% of \ninformation system   \nsurveyed sponsoring authorities \ndata  Sustained fiscal \nindicate expedited creation of \n  resources for grant \npipeline for bidding out or \nstructuring projects  Data from DEA and  support for project \n(feedback from sponsoring  prototype PPP cells  development and \nauthorities)  at state and line  viability gap funding \nministries, including \nRisks \nADB consultant \n \nreports \nUnfavorable \n \nmacroeconomic \nData for prototype \nconditions adversely \nPPP cells and \naffecting initiating of \nsurvey of \nprojects \nsponsoring \n \nauthorities by \nReduced public and \nrecruited \nprivate sector interest \nconsultants \nin PPP projects due to \nfactors such as slow \neconomic growth and \nimplementation issues \nwith ongoing PPP \nprojects \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
