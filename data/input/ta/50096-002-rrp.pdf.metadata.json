THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation\u2019s Green Financing \nPlatform Project. \n \n2.  The proposed Green Financing Platform (GFP)1 is the first of its kind dedicated to the \ngreater  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  (BTH) 2  region  that  will  leverage  financing  and  scale  up \ninvestments in green and pollution-reduction projects in sectors such as energy, transport, \nurban, and agriculture.3 It will also address market failures that have inhibited investment flows \nin energy efficiency, and will target emission reduction from small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs).4 The GFP will reinforce Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policy-based loan approved \nin 2015 for Hebei Province by scaling up investments in the policy actions throughout the BTH \nregion, thus, enlarging and accelerating its impacts.5  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Poor air quality in the BTH region is a serious health risk and economic burden. BTH, \nwhich generates nearly one-third of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product, is also the country\u2019s \nworst-polluted  region.  It  consistently  experiences  poor  air  quality  caused  by  an  excessive \nreliance  on  coal  in  the  energy  mix,  high  concentration  of  energy-  and  pollution-intensive \nindustrial enterprises, concentration of cars and vehicles, and weak environmental standards.6 \nAir pollution emergencies occur frequently in many of the region\u2019s cities.7 Nearly 228 million \npeople in the region live in cities where the average concentration of fine particles commonly \nknown as particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter (PM ) is predominantly higher \n2.5\nthan the safe level.8 Ambient air pollution, particularly higher concentration of PM , increases \n2.5\nthe risk of cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and ischemic heart disease, and is the \nfifth leading cause of premature deaths in the PRC.9 Children, the sick, and the elderly are the \n                                                \n1 Green financing platform is a term used to describe the project\u2019s financing approach which includes a set of diverse \nfinancial products with a common objective, which will also be adopted by a group of partner domestic banks. \n2  The greater BTH region consists of the Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and \nLiaoning provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n3  Based on various data, these sectors combined are responsible for nearly 95% of air pollution in the BTH region. \n4  For the industrial sector, enterprises with fewer than 1,000 employees and total assets of less than CNY400 million \nare SMEs. \n5  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed  Policy-Based  Loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  Air  Quality \nImprovement\u2013Hebei Policy Reforms Program. Manila. \n6  Air quality index (AQI) is a common measure of the quality of air and its potential health impacts. AQI includes \nconsideration of six atmospheric pollutants: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, particulate matter less than 2.5 microns \nin diameter (PM ), carbon monoxide, ozone, and particulate matter 10 micrometers or less in diameter In the \n2.5 .\nPRC, the AQI is categorized from 50 (excellent) to 500 (severe pollution). \n7  In December 2015, Beijing Air Pollution Emergency Headquarters issued a \u2018red alert\u2019 was issued for Beijing. The \nAQI threshold for a red alert is greater than 500 for 1 day, greater than 300 for 2 successive days, or greater than \n200 for 4 successive days. \n8  The PRC standard for PM  concentration is 35 micrograms per cubic meter (\u00b5g/m3), compared with 10 \u00b5g/m3 for \n2.5\nthe World Health Organization. In 2015, the region\u2019s annual average PM2.5 concentration was 73 \u00b5g/m3. \n9  Health Effects Institute and Tsinghua University. 2016. New Study: Air Pollution from Coal a Major Source of \nHealth Burden in China. Boston.  \n ", "2 \nmost vulnerable to such adverse effects. Exposure to high levels of PM  contributes to about 1 \n2.5\nmillion premature deaths annually in the PRC, with a disproportionate number of these in the \nBTH  region.  The  cost  of  premature  mortality  to  the  national  economy  is  estimated  as \napproximately 7.5% of the gross domestic product.10 Together, these are compelling reasons to \naddress the region\u2019s air quality issue. \n \n4.  The Government of the PRC is committed to improve air quality in the BTH region and \nhas made good progress.  In 2012, the State Council promulgated new ambient air quality \nstandards that tightened the concentration limit of six atmospheric pollutants (footnote 6). In \n2013, the government launched a nationwide  Comprehensive Action Plan for Air Pollution \nPrevention and Control (CAAP), 2013\u20132017, the first plan of its kind in the PRC, which outlined \nthe most stringent air pollution control measures in the PRC\u2019s history.11 Since the CAAP launch, \nair quality has gradually improved in the BTH region (footnote 11), but is still far below national \nand World Health Organization standards (footnote 8). The CAAP pairs well with the PRC\u2019s \ncommitment to peak its carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions by 2030 under the Paris Agreement \n2\nbecause coal combustion is the single-largest source for both air pollution and CO  emissions \n2\n(footnote 9). Since the BTH region is also responsible for about 40% of the country\u2019s CO  \n2\nemissions, it is a common top priority under both air quality and climate change policy goals. \nThe Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020) has reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to \naccelerate air quality improvement and includes mandatory targets.12 \n \n5.  Despite a promising start, tougher challenges remain to further improve air quality. \nCAAP helped accelerate the early retirement of surplus  industrial capacity and galvanized \nactions  for  cost-effective,  end-of-pipe  measures  to  yield  quick  results.13 But  many  similar \ninternational experiences have shown that air quality improvements require sustained long-term, \ncoordinated, and multisector efforts. Since air pollution easily migrates to neighboring areas, a \nBTH  region-wide  approach  is  also  essential.14 These  requirements  pose  significant  new \nchallenges for national, provincial, and city authorities in the BTH region that traditionally rely on \na sector-specific and city- or province-specific approach and are structured accordingly. \n \n6.  Some important sectors and segments need increased attention and targeted support. \nAir quality is generally considered an urban issue that tends to ignore, for example, agriculture \nsector (biomass burning) and rural energy consumption, which together are responsible for 15% \nof the region\u2019s PM emissions. Similarly, SMEs are key economic players in the BTH region, \n2.5 \naccounting for about 60% of industrial pollution.15 But, because of SMEs\u2019 lack of knowledge in \nadvanced and energy-efficient technologies, weak understanding of their cost-benefit evaluation, \nand,  most  importantly,  difficulties  in  accessing  commercial  credit, 16  they  are  seriously \nconstrained in taking actions to reduce pollution and emissions and are about 40% less energy \n                                                \n10 World Bank and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. 2016. The Cost of Air Pollution: Strengthening the \nEconomic Case for Action. Washington, DC.  \n11 CAAP aimed to cut the level of PM2.5 in the BTH region by 25%\u201330%. Compared with 2013, the annual average \nconcentration of PM  in the BTH region declined by 9.8% in 2014 and by a further 11.3% in 2015. \n2.5\n12 The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan requires (i) > 80% days with good air quality (less than 100 AQI) per year for cities at \nor above prefecture level, and (ii) 18% reduction in number of cities that do not meet the PM national standard. \n2.5 \nGovernment of the PRC. 2016.

Beijing. \n13 \u201cEnd-of-pipe\u201d actions require pollution control devices to scrub pollutants, which are effective for quick outcomes. \n14 A performance evaluation of the CAAP by the Clean Air Alliance of China found that 20% of PM  was a result of \n2.5\nregional transmission from neighboring provinces. \n15 Yao Guoyan. 2012. SMEs should actively undertake the corporate environmental responsibility. Environmental \nProtection. 7. pp. 52\u201353. \n16 Banks consider SME transactions highly risky and require good credit ratings or high levels of collateral, which \nmany SMEs cannot provide.   \n ", "3 \nefficient than large enterprises in the same sector.17 Energy service companies (ESCOs), which \nact  as  developers  for  energy  efficiency  improvement  projects  of  SMEs  and  assume  the \ntechnical and performance risks, can overcome many of these barriers and help SMEs. But \nESCOs  are  generally  SMEs  themselves  and  face  similar  hurdles  accessing  credit.18 The \ngovernment established green credit policies in 2007 and then revamped them in 2012 as \nGreen Credit Guidelines to encourage banks to support green industries and projects. But \ncommercial banks appetite for green financing is still limited to large polluting and excess \ncapacity  enterprises  instead  of  SMEs  or  ESCOs.  A  targeted  approach  combining  credit \nenhancement and tailored financing can unlock investments. But there is no financing vehicle \nthat can directly address these needs in the region. \n \n7.  The CAAP alone requires CNY1.8 trillion in investments, of which CNY250 billion is \nneeded in the BTH region. About CNY6.6 trillion is needed to meet low-carbon and clean \nenergy targets in the thirteenth plan. The scale of investment is a serious challenge, but bigger \nchallenges are to address market failures and channel financing into these environmental and \nlow-carbon  projects  for  which  returns  are  modest,  perceived  risks  are  high,  and,  despite \nconducive policies, commercial banks are hesitant to do transactions.  \n \n8.  The government requested ADB to design the project and to establish a GFP so as to \nmobilize domestic financing to air quality improvements in the BTH region by leveraging ADB \nloan proceeds. The project will use the financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality, which is the \nmost appropriate lending instrument to aggregate diverse projects across many sectors in the \nBTH region for which the financing requirements are not large enough to warrant direct lending \nby  ADB.  It  also  enables  ADB  and  the  government  to  establish  partnerships  with  local \ncommercial banks and domestic financial institutions to enable financing of such projects on \ncommercial terms. This modality was also employed in similar energy-efficient and emission-\nreduction projects in the PRC during 2008\u20132015 and has proved highly successful.19 The GFP \nbuilds on the lessons learned.20 \n \n9.  The GFP will offer three complementary financial products:21 (i) credit guarantees to \nenable commercial financing from banks, (ii) debt financing through entrusted loans,22 and (iii) \nfinancial leasing for purchasing energy-efficient industrial equipment and other goods to obviate \nthe need for large capital for SMEs and ESCOs.23 In addition, GFP may make short-term equity \n                                                \n17 International Energy Agency. 2015.

Manila. \n20 Lessons include that (i) capacity of the financial intermediary is a crucial factor; (ii) in previous FILs, credit risks \nwere borne by provinces or industrial entities, which led to a risk-averse approach in appraising transactions; and \n(iii) more rigorous due diligence can avoid high attrition rate among borrowers. \n21 These are broadly in line with the Group of Twenty and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \nguidance note on diversification of financial instruments for infrastructure and SMEs. \n22 An entrusted loan refers to the extension of credit by a bank as an agent of entrusted funds from the GFP. The \nbank will administer the debt, but assumes no credit risk. \n23 In leasing arrangements, the equipment is owned by the financial leasing company.  \n ", "4 \ninvestments in promising start-ups specializing in advanced low-carbon technologies to help \novercome barriers of lack of credit history and the collateral.24 The credit guarantees will ensure \nthat technically sound and financially viable subprojects with high energy-saving and pollution-\nreduction  potential  but  lack  collateral  will  meet  the  commercial  banks\u2019  requirements.  The \nfinancial intermediary will partner with commercial banks to offer entrusted loans at near market \nrates,  and  partner  banks  are  encouraged  to  provide  cofinancing.  GFP  can  provide  lease \nfinancing through financial leasing companies.25 The GFP will also be in close partnership with \nsome major commercial banks, thereby not only catalyzing large cofinancing from commercial \nbanks but also enhancing their capacity and interest in similar investments. \n \n10.  The importance of good air quality in the BTH region, which is home to nearly one-third \nof the PRC\u2019s total population, cannot be emphasized enough. It is a basic human need and a \ncritical component of Sustainable Development Goal 3: Ensure healthy lives and well-being for \nall at all ages and Goal 11: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and \nsustainable. Given the challenges and required actions (para. 5) in the BTH region, ADB and \nthe government have agreed in principle on a multiyear lending support program during 2016\u2013\n2020, which is well aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy priority of managing climate \nchange and the environment and the government\u2019s thirteenth plan.26 ADB\u2019s planned lending \nsupport during 2016\u20132020 will be about $500 million per year and will focus on (i) strengthening \npolicy and regulatory framework in the region, (ii) developing tailored financing approaches to \nunlock and channel investments in right areas, and (iii) leapfrogging technology in key sectors. \nADB support will complement government and other development partners\u2019 actions, such as the \nWorld  Bank.27 Yearly  ADB  lending  support  will  be  mutually  reinforcing  and  supported  by \nanalytical, policy advisory, and capacity development non-lending work, much of which is in \nprogress.28   \n \n11.  The 2015 policy-based loan (footnote 5) was ADB\u2019s entry point to address the BTH \nregion\u2019s air quality issue. This loan was fully disbursed in June 2016. The GFP is a logical next \nstep  to  fill  a  critical  gap  of  a  region-dedicated  financing  vehicle  and  expand  the  financial \nproducts tool kit to reduce primary air pollutants, and improve public health.29 The proposed \nGFP will help address the twin challenges of air quality improvements and climate change \nmitigation.   \n \n                                                \n24 The short-term equity investment will be with a clear exit strategy.  \n25 The detailed description of the financial products offered by the platform is in the Project Administration Manual \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n26 ADB. 2016.

The impacts will be reduced air pollution and improved public health in the BTH region. \nThe outcome will be accelerated air quality improvements and CO  emission reduction through \n2\nscaled-up investments in green and pollution-reduction projects in the BTH region. \n \nC.  Outputs \n13.  The outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: \n(i)  Output 1: Established green financing platform and leveraged commercial \nfinancing for pollution-reduction projects. The BTH region-dedicated platform \nwill scale up investments in sectors responsible for about 95% of the region\u2019s \npollution. By 2022, at least CNY6 billion will be leveraged from cofinanciers. \n(ii)  Output 2: Lowered barriers and scaled-up financing for small and medium-\nsized enterprises and energy service companies from the green financing \nplatform.  By  2022,  SMEs  and  ESCOs  will  receive  at  least  CNY1  billion \ninvestment from and as a result of the GFP. By working closely with domestic \nbanks, the project will strengthen their capacity and interest in SMEs and ESCOs \nfinancing.   \n(iii)  Output 3: Strengthened capacity in new financial products and to appraise \nand  implement  green  financing  projects.  Work  closely  with  financial \nintermediary and partner entrusted banks to build their capacity in new financial \nproducts, enhance safeguard measures as reflected in the environmental and \nsocial management system (ESMS), and help them to better understand how to \nunderwrite  and  appraise  green  and  pollution-reduction  projects  and  their \nimplementation.30 \n \nD.  Key Features of the Project \n14.  The  state-owned  China  National  Investment  and  Guaranty  Corporation  (I&G)  was \nselected by the government to set up the GFP because its core business areas are credit \nenhancement, assets management, and provision of investment and guarantee in many sectors. \nMoreover, I&G has an impressive track record of investment and guaranty operations in many \nBTH provinces and cities and has worked satisfactorily on a previous international financing \ninstitution\u2019s project.31 I&G will be the financial intermediary and the executing and implementing \nagency. The State Development & Investment Corporation (SDIC), the controlling state-owned \nenterprise of I&G, will provide credit enhancement for I&G.32 To assist I&G in its debt financing \noperation, the Bank of Beijing (BOB) has been selected through a competitive process to act as \none  of  the  entrusted  banks.33 Many  other  large  commercial  banks  have  expressed  strong \ninterest to act as an entrusted bank and/or cofinance subprojects selected by GFP.34 \n                                                \n30 A capacity development technical assistance is being processed (50096-003) to supplement GFP implementation \nand provide essential risk-mitigating measures. It aims to (i) improve the GFP\u2019s reach across all sectors, provinces, \nand cities through targeted outreach efforts; (ii) increase readiness of the subprojects; (iii) design and develop an \ninformation technology-based online platform for application by potential subprojects; and (iv) improve the capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies, participating banks and financial institutions, and subborrowers in \n \nappraising such projects and implementing the ESMS. \n31 World Bank\u2013Global Environment Facility project to provide first loss guarantee for energy efficiency projects. \n32 SDIC is one of the PRC\u2019s largest investment corporations with $76.2 billion equivalent total assets in 2015.  \n33 BOB, as an entrusted bank, will act as the agent of I&G (the principal). BOB will administer the entrusted loans \naccording to the terms and rates agreed with I&G, which will bear the loan risks. BOB will also cofinance projects. \nIn this regard a memorandum of understanding was signed with BOB on 3 November 2016.  \n34 Including  China  Development  Bank,  China  Merchant  Bank,  Guangfa  Bank,  China  CITIC  Bank,  and  China \nEverbright Bank.  \n \n ", "6 \n15.  To strengthen GFP targeting and ensure its financial viability, apart from entrusted loans, \nthe platform is designed as follows: (i) up to \u20ac91.6 million of the ADB loan amount will be used \nto support credit guarantees to enhance the credit of subborrowers so as to meet commercial \nbanks\u2019 credit requirements, (ii) up to \u20ac91.6 million of the ADB loan amount will target leasing \noperations, and (iii) short-term equity investments will be limited to \u20ac25 million. To manage its \nliquidity reserve for credit guarantees, I&G will use ADB loan proceeds to invest in high credit \nquality and highly liquid financial assets.35 \n \n16.  The  GFP  will  leverage  large  commercial  cofinancing.  An  estimated  \u20ac1.2  billion \ncofinancing and counterpart funds is expected from the first batch of subprojects. Since the \npayback period of subprojects is typically 3\u20138 years, as the initial batch of subloans is repaid, \nthe proceeds will be relent to another set of subprojects. For this purpose, a reflow account will \nbe established. It is expected that reflows from the first batch will be relent to additional batches \nof subprojects with an estimated investment of \u20ac2.4 billion. Thus, the GFP is expected to \nleverage \u20ac3.6 billion.  \n \nE.  Investment and Financing Plans \n17.  The investment cost of the first batch of subprojects is estimated to be \u20ac1,675 million \n(Table 1), including the financial charges on entrusted and cofinancing loans. \n \nTable 1: Indicative Investment Amounts for First Batch of Subprojects \n(\u20ac million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Project Management Expenses   23.4 \n      Total (A+B+C)   1,675.0 \na  Includes taxes and duties estimated to be \u20ac102 million, of which an estimated \u20ac30 million will be from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) loan proceeds. The amount of taxes and duties to be financed by ADB (i) is within the \nreasonable threshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation process, (ii) does not represent \nan excessive share of the investment plan, and (iii) applies only to ADB-financed expenditures. The financing of \ntaxes and duties is considered relevant to project success. The interest cost of ADB loan proceeds during \nimplementation has been estimated at the 5-year forward euro interbank offered rate plus a spread of 0.5%. \nCommitment charges for an ADB loan have been estimated at 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed \nloan amount. The total financial charges of the ADB loan during implementation have been estimated at \u20ac5.5 \nmillion. However, they are not included in the table to avoid double counting as I&G can recover this through the \ninterest on subloans. \nb  The guarantee loss reserve may be used for investment in high credit quality, highly liquid financial assets. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n18.  The government has requested a loan of \u20ac458 million ($499.6 million equivalent) from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the project.36 The loan will have a 15-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 10 years,37 an annuity repayment at the 10% discount rate option, an \n                                                                                                                                                       \n \n35 Such financial assets should preferably be high quality (AA- or better as rated by a reputable local rating agency); \nthey may include green bonds. \n36 Three scenarios for CNY, United States dollar, and euro lending were built to simulate the risks under different \nscenarios. Based on the simulation, I&G decided to borrow in euro. \n37 A longer grace period is essential to seek the rollover of ADB loan proceeds and larger impacts. \n ", "7 \nannual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on this, the average \nloan maturity is 12.95 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The loan is \nexpected to leverage \u20ac863.6 million from local commercial banks.38 Subborrowers will provide \nabout \u20ac330 million as counterpart contributions. \n \n19.  The ADB loan proceeds will be onlent from the Ministry of Finance to I&G through SDIC \non identical repayment, tenors, and pricing terms of ADB\u2019s loan. SDIC and I&G will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. I&G will utilize the ADB loan amount through financing instruments (para. \n15) under the platform. Fund flow, implementation, nature and scope of the financial instruments, \nand  risk-sharing  arrangements  are  described  in  Appendix  1  of  the  Project  Administration \nManual (PAM).39 The financing plan for the first batch of subprojects is in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan for First Batch of Subprojects \n(\u20ac million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 39). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2017\u2013March 2022 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2032 (loan closing date: 30 September 2022) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  SDIC \n(ii) Executing agency   I&G is the executing agency. \n(iii) Financial intermediary  I&G will bear the credit risk of the subprojects and will have subproject approval \nand implementing  authority, subject to ADB concurrence in certain circumstances. I&G will be required to \nagency  obtain a no objection from ADB for subprojects above the free limit of \u20ac50 million and \nany environment category A subprojects. I&G will enter into partnership agreements \nwith the Bank of Beijing for administering entrusted loans providing cofinancing. \n(iv) Implementation unit  The PMO established in I&G will act as the main implementation unit and will have up \nto  20  full-time  staff.  The  PMO  will  enter  into  a  strategic  corporation  framework \nagreement with the Appraisal Center for Environment and Engineering  to provide \nexpertise on environment assessment and monitoring. I&G will also recruit technical \nexperts in technical appraisal and monitoring, as necessary. \n                                                \n38 ADB and domestic commercial banks will enter into a separate collaborative cofinancing arrangement through a \nmemorandum of understanding to ensure the application of ADB policies and other requirements. \n39 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nAspects  Arrangements \nProcurement  The subborrowers will use commercial practices acceptable to ADB for procuring goods \nand services using the proceeds of subloans and investments. A procurement manual \nhas been prepared to provide guidance on how commercial practices can be adopted in \na manner consistent with ADB\u2019s procurement principles. \nRetroactive financing  The executing agency may enter into subloan agreements prior to the loan agreement \nand/or advance  signing  with  ADB,  and  this  will  be  deemed  as  advance  contracting.  Retroactive \ncontracting  financing may be provided to any subloan being refinanced or to a subproject that was \ncommenced before the effective date, provided that expenditures were incurred not \nearlier  than  12  months  prior  to the  signing  of  the  loan  agreement,  and  that the \nsubproject to be refinanced has been vetted under I&G\u2019s environmental and social \nmanagement system and is fully compliant. The total retroactive financing will not \nexceed 20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed between the \ngovernment and ADB, and described in the project administration manual as special \ndisbursement guidelines.a \nADB = Asian Development Bank, I&G = China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation, PMO = project \nmanagement office, SDIC = State Development & Investment Corporation. \na Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: ADB. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n21.  The PAM details the subproject selection criteria, covering applicable technical, financial, \neconomic, and environment and social safeguard requirements. It also includes guidelines on \nthe screening and appraisal of individual transactions. I&G is required to prepare appraisal \nreports to verify compliance with selection criteria and obtain ADB\u2019s no objection for subprojects \nthat (i) are financed with retroactive financing, (ii) receive financing in excess of the free limit of \n\u20ac50 million, and (iii) are assessed as category A for the environment.  \n \n22.  A detailed appraisal of the 11 representative potential subprojects was carried out.40 \nThese projects include waste heat capture and delivery, agriculture waste utilization, distributed \nrenewable energy, energy efficiency, smart transport and electrical vehicles, and emission- \nreduction and are spread across the BTH region. The representative subprojects cost \u20ac340 \nmillion and would utilize about \u20ac124 million of the ADB loan. Another set of potential subprojects \nwith total investment needs of \u20ac1 billion is currently being appraised.  \n \nA.  Technical \n23.  Technical due diligence of representative subprojects (i) verified the technical feasibility \nand appropriateness of the proposed technology to achieve the desired energy savings and \npollution reductions; (ii)  verified estimated cost; and (iii) reviewed main contract packages to be \nprocured and proposed procurement methods. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  Financial due diligence confirmed the financial viability of SDIC, I&G, and BOB. SDIC \nand I&G have a strong financial standing and are capable of meeting financial obligations and \ndebt  service  payments  without  difficulty.41 The  integrity  due  diligence  of  I&G  showed  no \nnegative findings. Subprojects and subborrowers will need to meet economic and financial \nviability criteria as agreed with I&G and acceptable to ADB, as documented in the PAM. The \n                                                \n40 The technical description of representative sample subprojects is in the Introduction of Technologies Used for \nSample Subprojects (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nfinancial  assessment  of  the  platform  demonstrated  its  sustainability  under  prudent  loss \nassumptions.42 \n \n25.  The financial internal rate of return was calculated for the appraised representative \nsubprojects. It ranges from 4.78% to 22.80%, which is much higher than the weighted average \ncost of capital. The economic internal rate of return of the appraised subprojects ranges from \n17.28% to 25.39%.   \n   \nC.  Governance \n26.  Financial  management  assessment.  The  financial  management  assessment  was \nconducted following ADB\u2019s Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.43 The results for \nSDIC, I&G, and BOB showed that adequate financial management systems and procedures are \nin place to meet ADB requirements. The external audit reports from 2012\u20132015 for SDIC, I&G, \nand BOB had unqualified opinion. BOB fully complies with the regulator\u2019s prudential regulations. \nThe financial management risks before mitigation were assessed to be moderate (footnote 41). \n \n27.  Procurement risk assessment. Procurement will follow ADB\u2018s Procurement Guidelines \n(2015, as amended from time to time) applicable to FILs, and appropriate procedures will be \nadopted. The procurement assessment was conducted on representative potential subprojects. \nIt showed that most of subborrowers\u2019 procurement practices followed established domestic \ncommercial practices, and procurement procedures aligned with the PRC\u2019s procurement laws \nacceptable to ADB. To provide guidance on this, a project-specific procurement manual has \nbeen prepared and included in Appendix 5 of the PAM. \n \n28.  Corruption prevention. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with SDIC, I&G, and BOB. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n29.  The project will have positive social impacts by reducing air pollution and mitigating the \nnegative economic impacts of the local pollution. Improved air quality will directly benefit 371.7 \nmillion people, including 14.6 million poor people in the BTH region. In addition, the project will \nindirectly create new employment opportunities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  The  project  is  classified  financial  intermediary.  An  ESMS44 was  developed  to meet \nnational  laws  and  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009).  The  ESMS \nprovides guidance on (i) screening, categorization, and review of subprojects; (ii) organizational \nstructure and staffing, including skills and competencies in environmental and social areas; (iii) \ncapacity building; and (iv) monitoring and reporting. I&G and SDIC will be responsible for ESMS \nimplementation. The ESMS provides for the inclusion of environment category A subprojects. If \nany such subprojects are included, ADB will review and approve the environmental impact \nassessments, which must meet Safeguard Policy Statement requirements on disclosure and \nconsultation. \n \n                                                \n42 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n43 ADB. 2005.
