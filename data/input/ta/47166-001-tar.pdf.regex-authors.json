The Punjab public and private agriculture research institutions, basmati rice farmers, \ntraders and exporters, and the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) asked the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  pilot  innovations  on  improving \nbasmati seed variety and developing value chain with private sector participation and links of \nfarmers to processing and markets. Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s global comparative edge in basmati \nproduction  and  export  is  fast  eroding  due  to  the  poor  performance  of  the  upstream  and \nmidstream segments of the basmati rice value chain. ADB fielded a TA consultation mission \nduring 26 February\u20135 March 2013 to identify key challenges and opportunities, and a fact-\nfinding  mission  during  18\u201323  August  2013  to  finalize  the  TA  design  and  implementation \narrangements.  The  government  concurred  with  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  and  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  TA  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rice is the third largest crop in Pakistan after wheat and cotton. Rice production on \naverage accounted for 4.4% of agriculture value added and 1% of gross domestic product. It is \ngrown on about 2.5 million hectares, or 10% of annual cropped area, for an annual production of \nabout 6.15 million tons.2 Pakistan ranks 13th in rice production and fourth in rice exports in the \nworld. During fiscal year 2013, its rice exports of 3.1 million tons have earned about $1.9 billion.3 \n \n3.  Basmati  rice\u2014famous  for  its  aroma,  long  grain  size,  and  high  cooking  and  eating \nquality\u2014is a leading foreign exchange earner of Pakistan, which accounts for more than two-\nthirds of the world\u2019s basmati production.4 Basmati is grown mainly in Punjab, and in fiscal year \n2012,  65%  of  Punjab\u2019s  total  rice  area,  or  1.1  million  hectares,  was  devoted  to  basmati, \nproducing about 2 million tons. \n \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s competitive edge in the basmati world market, however, has been eroding in \nrecent years because of productivity and quality constraints. Although Pakistan has historically \nbeen the world\u2019s leading supplier of basmati rice, from July\u2013December 2012, basmati exports \ndeclined by 31% (from 349,970 tons to 239,765 tons) compared to the same period in previous \nyears. This decline came after India lifted a ban on its rice exports in 2012 and sold the \ncommodity at a price lower than Pakistan: about $100 cheaper per ton against Pakistan\u2019s \n$1,100\u2013$1,150 per ton due to its higher yield and more diverse varieties.5 Meanwhile, demand \nfor basmati has been increasing worldwide. Pakistan\u2019s basmati value chain therefore needs to \nbe strengthened to meet rising international demand and maintain its status as the world\u2019s \nleading supplier of basmati rice. \n \n5.  The major bottleneck in Pakistan\u2019s basmati value chain is at the upstream segment, or \nfarm production. High production costs and declining yield of current basmati varieties make its \ncultivation a less profitable venture for Punjab rice farmers, resulting in some farmers shifting to \nother varieties for better yields. Key constraints of basmati farm production are the following: \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 August 2013.  \n2  S.

Mild Export Growth Amidst Growing International Competition. London. \n ", "2  \n \n(i)  Limited basmati varieties. Compared to Indian farmers, who have access to several \nhigh-yielding basmati varieties, Pakistani farmers have access to and cultivate mainly \none variety, Super Basmati, which was introduced in 1996 and is grown in 70% of the \ntotal basmati area in Punjab. Basmati 515, an improved variety, was introduced in 2011, \nbut its adoption has been slow as farmers have limited access to certified seeds and \nproper training for its production. Both Super Basmati and Basmati 515 are neither \nresistant to bacterial leaf blight (BLB) nor tolerant of extended dry spells, which occur \nincreasingly in basmati growing areas. \n(ii)  Inadequate  research  and  development  funds.  The  Punjab  Agricultural  Research \nBoard (PARB) allocates funds for research and development (R&D) relevant to the \nprovince\u2019s  agriculture  sector.  The  PARB\u2019s  role  has  significantly  improved  R&D \nadministration, management, and coordination among all institutions involved. However, \nthe PARB\u2019s annual R&D budget of about PRs180 million remains modest given the size \nand requirement of Punjab\u2019s agriculture. The Rice Research Institute at Kalashah Kaku, \nthe leading institution on rice development in the province, has a meager annual budget \nof PRs30 million. Because of this resource constraint, Punjab\u2019s agriculture R&D remains \nsignificantly underfunded.  \n(iii)  On-farm challenges. Basmati farmers face a number of production constraints, such as \nlack  of  access  to  certified  seed;  low  plant  population  (an  average  of  125,000 \nplants/hectare  against  the  recommended  200,000);  BLB;  input  supply  quality  and \nquantity;  labor  shortage  during  transplanting  and  harvesting;  unavailability  or \ninappropriate types of combined harvesters that result in a 3%\u20137% loss of paddy; high \nmoisture content at harvesting (more than 30% compared to the desired 20%\u201322% at \nharvest and 12%\u201314% for storage); lack of sufficient mechanical drying and storage \nfacilities, contributing to aflatoxin growth; and poor extension services. These constraints \nresult in an average basmati paddy yield of about 2.4 tons/hectare, compared to about \n3.2 tons/hectare in India. Given the potential yield of current basmati varieties, average \npaddy yield could be more than 3 tons/hectare if most constraints are addressed. \n \n6.  Overcoming the major problems affecting Punjab\u2019s basmati rice production is urgently \nneeded for Pakistan to regain and sustain its competitiveness in the world market, improve the \nsubsector\u2019s foreign exchange earnings, and ensure higher incomes for basmati farmers and \nother stakeholders in the value chain. The TA will focus on measures that meet the following \ncriteria: (i) tangible results achievable within 2\u20133 years; (ii) complementing and adding value to \nongoing activities of public and private sector stakeholders; and (iii) having the potential to \nsignificantly increase the yields of basmati rice, improve the efficiency of the upstream segment \nof the basmati value chain, and integrate the upstream segment more effectively with the \nmidstream and downstream segments of the value chain. \n \n7.  The TA supports Pakistan\u2019s and Punjab\u2019s development priorities and is consistent with \nADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2009\u20132013,  which  supports  government  efforts  for \nsustained  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  by  increasing  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness in key sectors, including agriculture.6 ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2013\u20132014, continues the country partnership strategy focus of more efficient and productive \nirrigation  and  more  reliable  water  resources,  with  corresponding  reforms  to  improve  the \nperformance of the agriculture sector.7 Linked to this is continued enhancement of public\u2013\nprivate  partnerships  to  support  the  government\u2019s  strategy  for  private  sector  development, \nincreased competitiveness, and structural change. The government\u2019s growth strategy is focused \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2009\u20132013. Manila. \n7  ADB. 2013.

The agriculture sector focus of Punjab\u2019s Medium Term \nDevelopment Framework 2012\u20132015 and Development Programme 2012\u20132013 centers on food \nsecurity and the promotion of exportable high-value crops, with an emphasis on sustained \nproductivity  improvement  in  wheat  and  rice  by  encouraging  public  sector  research  and \ncollaboration.8 \n \n8.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security on \nincreasing synergy and value addition in backward and forward linkages along the food and \nagriculture value chain.9 The TA will directly complement ADB\u2019s investments in Punjab, such as \nthe  Punjab  Irrigated  Agriculture  Investment  Program,  which  rehabilitates  key  irrigation \ninfrastructure in Punjab and benefits farm families who derive their livelihoods directly from \ncrops grown in the command area, such as wheat, rice, and maize.10 The command areas of \ntranches 1\u20133 of the Punjab Irrigated Agriculture Investment Program overlap  with basmati \ngrowing areas such as Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Jhang, Nankana Sahib, Okara, \nSahiwal, and Sheikhupura districts. \n \n9.  Successful TA outcomes can be scaled up and scaled out through ADB investments. \nThese outcomes may include basmati rice commercialization, public\u2013private partnership rice \nvalue chain infrastructure development, or agribusiness projects that finance selected private \nsector  companies  demonstrating good  performance  under the TA  in  agriculture  machinery \ndevelopment, advisory and extension services, and linking farmers to the market. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA impact will be higher incomes of basmati rice farmers in Punjab. The outcome \nwill be improved basmati rice productivity and quality in TA pilot sites. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA outputs will be (i) improved basmati seed varieties, (ii) improved farming and \npostharvest practices, and (iii) improved research and service capabilities. \n \n12.  Improved  basmati  seed  varieties.  Since  2009,  the  PARB  has  supported  varietal \nresearch to make Super Basmati, Basmati 515, and pipeline varieties resistant to BLB by \nfunding and coordinating research efforts at the Rice Research Institute, Nuclear Institute for \nAgriculture and Biology, National Institute for Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering, Ayub \nAgricultural Research Institute, and Emkay Seeds Limited, a private R&D company. These \ninstitutions have made significant progress in developing promising new breeding lines resistant \nto BLB that could be released in 2\u20133 years; however, the release is constrained by shortage of \nfunds for trial testing and lack of proper genes from the IRRI. Supplementing the ongoing work \nof the national research centers, the TA will (i) support the evaluation of high-yielding, BLB-\nresistant basmati varieties under field conditions and advance their release; (ii) introduce and \ntransfer  additional  BLB-resistant  genes  from  the  IRRI  into  Pakistan  basmati  lines;  and  \n(iii)  finance  joint  research  in  the  IRRI  and  national  institutions  on  adding  drought-tolerant, \n                                                \n8  Planning and Development Department, Government of Punjab. 2012 Medium Term Development Framework \n2012\u20132015 and Development Programme 2012\u20132013.

The  TA  will  support  specific \nresearch studies (e.g., grain discoloration) and finance field and laboratory equipment. \n \n13.  Requests for germplasm acquisition from the IRRI will be coursed through the Pakistan \nAgricultural Research Council (PARC), which will then interface with the IRRI in introducing the \ngermplasm to Pakistan, in accordance with the standard material transfer protocol between \nPakistan and the IRRI. Once the improved seed varieties are available from the research \ninstitutes, the PARC, as mandated, will facilitate national uniform yield trials. \n \n14.  Improved farming and postharvest practices. Through a competitive grant scheme, \nthe TA will support public and private service providers to pilot test and demonstrate innovative \npractices and develop appropriate marketable technologies that will result in increased basmati \nproductivity and reduced postharvest loss. Proposals will be solicited for initiatives in areas such \nas (i) refining a direct seeding method in farmer fields for better seed usage;11 (ii) developing, \ntesting, and demonstrating an appropriate seed drill to make direct seeding more efficient;  \n(iii) mechanical transplanting with the introduction of appropriate transplanters to save labor and \nwater  and  improve  the  plant  population;  (iv)  expanding  the  introduction  and  operation  of \nappropriate rice harvesters by the private sector; or (v) developing paddy drying technology and \nrice dryers to reduce moisture content and to avoid aflatoxin, which poses food safety hazards. \n \n15.  Improved research and service capabilities. Based on the needs assessment, the TA \nwill develop and implement a capacity building and training plan for key stakeholders in the \nbasmati value chain (i.e., public institutions, farmers, and private service providers) as well as a \nshort training course on variety development in the IRRI. The TA will finance specific studies, \nsuch as a review of the public finance framework, to prepare proposals for adequate and \nsustainable agriculture R&D funding. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, secretarial \nassistance, domestic transportation for counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 3 years (January 2014\u2013December 2016). \nADB will be responsible for overall TA management. The Agriculture, Rural Development and \nFood  Security  Unit  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  the \nEnvironment,  Natural  Resources  and  Agriculture  Division  of  the  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment will be ADB\u2019s focal point in collaboration with the Pakistan Resident Mission. \n \n18.  The PARB will be the executing agency and will establish a separate account to receive \nfunds directly from ADB for eligible TA expenses. An advance payment facility will be provided \nto the PARB. The PARB chief executive will oversee TA implementation, and the TA will finance \na national TA coordinator to work under the guidance and supervision of the PARB chief \n                                                \n11  The PARC, Rice Research Institute, and Engro Eximp Ltd. have conducted direct seeding trials in farmer fields, \nand the results are promising. On machineries development and pilot testing, the TA will consult with the \nAgricultural  and  Biological  Engineering  Institute  of  the  National  Agricultural  Research  Center,  Agricultural \nMachinery Institute, Punjab, and other similar institutes to ensure complementarities and value addition. \n ", "    5\nexecutive. The PARB will hold an inception workshop by March 2014 to provide a detailed work \nplan for each output, and a final workshop in December 2016 to communicate the TA results \nand lesson learned to researchers, farmers, and policy makers. The PARB will submit to ADB (i) \nan inception report by 31 March 2014, (ii) quarterly progress reports, (iii) a draft TA completion \nreport by October 2016, and (iv) a final TA completion report by December 2016. \n \n19.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), \nand consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n20.  The TA requires 24 person-months of international consulting services on plant breeding, \nbiotechnology,  and  agriculture  engineering;  and  36  person-months  of  national  consulting \nservices on TA coordination support. ADB will engage the IRRI in providing the international \nconsulting services using single source selection. The choice of the IRRI is due to its long track \nrecord  and  internationally  recognized  research,  training,  and  knowledge  transfer  works  in \ndeveloping new rice varieties and rice crop management techniques. The TA requires the \nprovision  of  specific  germplasm  from  the  IRRI  to  Pakistan,  and  the  IRRI,  as  a  center  of \nexcellence on rice, is the only qualified institution with experience for the assignment. The value \nof the IRRI contract is about $437,000. ADB will engage the national TA coordinator on an \nindividual basis. The outline terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  For output 2, service providers will be recruited through consultant qualification selection. \nKey selection criteria are (i) at least 5 years demonstrated relevant experience; (ii) clearly \ndefined approach to (a) overcoming major constraints that result in low basmati yields, such as \ninappropriate farm practices, low input quality, poor cultural practices, and inadequate technical \ncapacity of basmati farmers; (b) reducing production costs, adding value to basmati rice, or \nconserving resources; and (c) benefiting smallholder farmers; (iii) capacity to make counter-part \ncontribution in cash or in kind (e.g., providing farms for research or providing contract farmers \nfor  the  field  testing  and  demonstration);  (iv)  qualification  of  experts  with  at  least  5-year \nexperience; (v) cost of proposal (the average grant amount per proposal will be $25,000, with a \nmaximum of $40,000); and (vi) compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \nPARB will submit selected proposals to ADB for approval first before entering into agreements \nwith the public or private service providers. \n \n22.  The TA will have a semi-annual review by ADB. The PARC will be responsible for \nconducting a baseline assessment at TA inception and an impact evaluation at TA completion. \nParameters,  including  yield,  landholdings,  cropping  pattern,  input  use,  disease  resistance, \ndrought or submergence tolerance, and farmer and consumer preference, will be evaluated. \nScientific and economic comparative analyses of the new initiatives will be done to make \nfarmers and agribusiness beneficiaries more aware of their options. Good practices and lessons \nlearned will be prepared, including a manual on good farming and postharvest practices with \nprivate sector engagement, to be disseminated through national workshops and publications.  \n \nIV.
