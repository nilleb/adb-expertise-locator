INTRODUCTION \n1.  Myanmar  is  vulnerable  to  natural  hazard-related  disasters.  Between  1980  and \n2015, disasters in Myanmar caused about 140,000 deaths and affected the lives of more than 5 \nmillion people.1 Accordingly, the Government of Myanmar has identified in its disaster risk \nmanagement (DRM) and climate change adaptation (CCA)-related policy frameworks the need \nfor capacity-building support in different sectors. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)  has \nsupported the government\u2019s development of a National Framework for Community Disaster \nResilience and implementation of post-disaster recovery projects involving community-based \ninterventions.2 \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) responds to the government\u2019s request and will contribute \nto the implementation of its priorities, as well as the implementation of ADB\u2019s Operational Plan \nfor Integrated Disaster Risk Management, 2014\u20132020 and ADB\u2019s Financial Sector Operational \nPlan.3 The TA will complement ongoing and future ADB investments and initiatives of other \ndevelopment partners.4 \n3.  The  TA\u2019s  proposed  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants were discussed and agreed with \ngovernment agencies during a TA fact-finding mission fielded 24\u201328 October 2016 in Nay Pyi \nTaw.5 The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019 for Myanmar. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Disasters  triggered  by  natural  hazards\u2014floods,  tropical  cyclones,  landslides,  and \ndroughts\u2014affect a significant share of Myanmar\u2019s population and the country\u2019s economy. The \npoorer  community  members  are  often  worst  impacted  by  the  disasters. The  interaction of \nnatural  hazards  with  socioeconomic  vulnerabilities  creates  considerable  disaster  risk.  For \nexample, women are likely to be more vulnerable to natural hazards\u2014reflecting their limited \naccess to land ownership, finances, trainings, and information and communication technology. \nAdditionally,  climate  change  is  altering  the  hazard  patterns  in  Myanmar,  thereby  further \nincreasing disaster risk. It is anticipated that the potential climate change impacts could lead to \nhigher hazard levels for tropical cyclones, floods, and extreme temperature and drought.  \n \n5.   During the last decade, the government has strengthened its policy landscape for DRM \nand CCA, which demonstrates its commitment to manage climate and disaster risk.6 However, \n                                                \n1  Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. The International Disaster Database.  www.emdat.be \n(accessed 31 January 2017).   \n2  Government of Myanmar. 2017. Myanmar National Framework for Community Disaster Resilience, Nay Pyi Taw; \nADB. 2016. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Administration of \nGrant to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Emergency Support for Chin State Livelihood Restoration \nProject. Manila \n3  Categorized as knowledge and support technical assistance under the new staff instructions effective 13 March \n2017. \n4  ADB. 2013. Proposed Grant Assistance to Myanmar for Enhancing Rural Livelihoods and Incomes. Manila; \nExamples of other development partners\u2019 initiatives include: (i) Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund\u2019s support \non village development planning, and (ii) the World Bank\u2019s Southeast Asia Disaster Resilience Insurance Program.  \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 February 2017. \n6  Examples  of  policy  achievements  include  the  adoption  of  the  National  Disaster  Management  Law,  2013; \nformulation of the Myanmar Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction and the National Adaptation Programme of \nAction, 2009; ongoing development of the Nationally Determined Contribution; ongoing formulation of the National \nClimate Change Strategy; and establishment of the National Disaster Management Fund. \n ", "2   \ncapacity  gaps  remain  within  the  government,  particularly  in  (i)  understanding  climate  and \ndisaster risks, as agencies lack the capacity to assess the spatial and temporal nature of climate \nand disaster risk and use such information for resilience-related planning, and to observe, \nanalyze, predict, and provide early warning services for climate-related hazards; (ii) utilizing \nclimate and disaster risk information for decision making, or utilizing climate and disaster risk \ninformation to identify resilience-related investments in the agriculture and rural development \nsector, and ensuring that weather, climate, and hydrological forecasts reach the last mile and \nhelp in decision making of the farmers and the rural communities;7 and (iii) utilizing climate and \ndisaster risk information for improving financial preparedness to manage residual disaster risk, \nas there are limited efforts to assess disaster risk from a financial perspective and accordingly \ndevelop disaster risk financing (DRF) instruments ex-ante for post-disaster response.8   \n \n6.  Addressing  such  issues  requires  interagency  cooperation  and  long-term  capacity \nbuilding of government agencies\u2014including national focal agencies for DRM, CCA, planning, \nand  finance\u2014and  sector  agencies  to  better  understand  current  and  future  implications  of \nclimate and disaster risk on achieving development objectives; and utilizing such information for \nresilience planning and identifying investments, including those to strengthen financial resilience. \nMoreover, recognizing the novelty of undertaking climate- and disaster-risk-informed decision \nmaking, especially at the local level, there is an urgent need for pilot testing at the subnational \nlevel to demonstrate this approach and learn lessons for scaling up.  \n \n7.  The proposed TA will support national-level institutional capacity development as well as \nlocal pilot testing of innovative approaches. The Ayeyarwady Region has been selected for the \npilot testing in view of government priorities as well as high disaster risks, potential impacts of \nclimate change, socioeconomic vulnerabilities and dependence on climate-sensitive livelihoods \nin this Region.9 The pilot testing will be implemented at the community level and will align with \npriorities of the Myanmar National Framework for Community Disaster Resilience related to \nagriculture, rural development, and financial inclusion. Within Ayeyarwady Region, activities will \nbe implemented in selected villages of Pathein and Ngapudaw townships to ensure synergies \nwith existing microfinance institutions and ongoing projects.  \n \n                                                \n7  The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology provides a range of weather and climate forecast products (i.e., \nseasonal outlook, monthly weather, 10-day weather, and daily weather forecast) and hydrological forecasts (i.e., \nlong-range flood forecast, monthly forecast, 10-day forecast, and daily water-level forecast). However, significant \ngaps remain to enhance the forecast resolution, both spatial and temporal, and its application. \n8  The primary in-advance DRF instrument in use is the budgetary reserve for post-disaster response, which is \ninsufficient and requires the government to rely on international assistance and budget reallocations in the event of \nmajor disasters. Moreover, the limited financial capacity of farmers to manage disaster risk\u2014including highly \nlimited insurance coverage\u2014places additional contingent liability on government.  \n9  The Ayeyarwady Region was one of the five regions declared disaster areas by the Government of Myanmar after \nCyclone Nargis.  \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.    The  impact  will  be  increased  capacity  of  government  for  strengthening  resilience, \nincluding financial resilience, to extreme weather events in Myanmar. The outcome will be \nstrengthened climate and disaster risk governance at the national level and in Ayeyarwady \nregion in Myanmar. To achieve the outcome, the TA will adopt a comprehensive approach of \ncombining disaster risk reduction, CCA, and DRF. Activities will be implemented primarily at the \nnational level and at pilot sites in Ayeyarwady Region.  \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will include three outputs.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Improved capacity in government agencies at the national level and in \nAyeyarwady region to understand climate and disaster risk. This output will help strengthen \ngovernment officials\u2019 understanding of climate and disaster risk\u2014and its potential impacts on \nthe poor and vulnerable\u2014at the national level and for Ayeyarwady, thus increasing the political \nwill to prioritize risk-informed investments to strengthen resilience, including financial planning \nfor  post-disaster  response.  The  output  will  (i)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  national-level \ngovernment institutions responsible for DRM and CCA to better understand risks from extreme \nweather  events; 10  (ii)  undertake  disaster  risk  modeling  at  the  national  level  and  for \nAyeyarwady;11 (iii) support the development of a DRM plan and a recovery guide at the national \nlevel, and a DRM plan for Ayeyarwady; (iv) install hydrometeorological stations (at least 10) in \nAyeyarwady  to  improve  government  capacity  to  produce  improved  hydrometeorological \nforecasts  of  different  timescales  and  enhance  early  warning  systems;  and  (v)  improve \ngovernment capacity at the national level and in Ayeyarwady to systematically collect disaster \nloss data.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Enhanced capacity of government agencies at the national level and of \nselected communities in Ayeyarwady region to undertake disaster-resilient investments \nin the agriculture and rural development sector. With a majority of poor and vulnerable \npeople living in Myanmar\u2019s rural areas\u2014and given their high dependence on climate-sensitive \nlivelihoods\u2014it is critical to build capacity at all levels to use climate and disaster risk information \nto protect development gains and prioritize investments that would strengthen resilience. This \noutput will (i) support the development of a decision-making tool for the Ministry of Agriculture, \nLivestock, and Irrigation staff, undertaking the necessary capacity building for agriculture and \nrural development-related government agencies to systematically use climate and disaster risk \ninformation to plan, identify, and prioritize investments;12 (ii) pilot test  the use of mid- and long-\nrange climate information for agriculture planning through capacity strengthening of field-level \ngovernment  officials  and  selected  rural  community  members,  especially  women,  in \nAyeyarwady;13 and (iii) pilot test the integration of disaster and climate risk considerations in \nvillage  development  planning  processes  and  implementation  of  selected  non-structural, \n                                                \n10 TA trainings will be implemented through the government\u2019s national disaster management training center, where \nappropriate. This will contribute to strengthening the capacity of trainers in the center and overall TA sustainability.  \n11 This will include using advanced technology such as earth-observation data, crowdsourcing and community \nmapping techniques, and an open-source geographical information system platform for data visualization. \n12 Preferably using an open-source geographic information system platform. \n13 Including, where needed, the installation of agrometeorological stations in the pilot areas. \n ", "4   \ncommunity investments to strengthen resilience of  selected vulnerable rural communities in \nAyeyarwady.14   \n \n12.  Output 3: Increased awareness and capacity for disaster risk financing among \ngovernment  and  the  private  sector  in  Myanmar.  This  output  will  build  capacity  of  the \ngovernment  and  financial  institutions  to  adopt  a  comprehensive  approach  to  identify  and \ndevelop a national DRF strategy based on a thorough understanding and quantification of \ndisaster risk (undertaken in output 1). The output will (i) support the development of a national \nDRF  strategy  based  on  a  risk-layered  approach  that  will  recommend  suitable  financing \ninstruments\u2014including insurance (such as microinsurance, agricultural insurance, small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  insurance,  and  portfolio  insurance  of  microfinance  institutions), \ndepending  on  the  needs  of  the  most  vulnerable  and  capacities  of  policyholders  and  the \ninsurance  sector\u2014and  how  such  instruments  can  be  piloted;  (ii)  undertake  review  of  the \nenabling environment, including policy and regulatory challenges, for disaster risk insurance; (iii) \nstrengthen  awareness  and  capacity  of  government  and  financial  institutions,  including  the \ninsurance regulator, on DRF; and (iv) in collaboration with a selected microfinance organization \nin Ayeyarwady, pilot test new instruments to strengthen the resilience of its clients, especially \nwomen,  including  improved  resilience-enhancing  credit  products,  disaster  microinsurance \nproducts, and a scheme for recovery lending.  \n \n13.  Risks. Risks include that (i) investments in CCA and DRM are  sidelined with other \ndevelopment priorities based on short-term agendas, thereby reducing the use of TA-developed \ninformation and tools; and (ii) disaster risk information of appropriate quality and scale is not \navailable or is difficult to collect, especially in conflict-affected areas. To mitigate the risks, the \nTA will (i) undertake regular dialogue with high-level decision makers and (ii) adopt a wide range \nof technologies\u2014including high-resolution, earth-observation data and other ground validation \nmethods\u2014to collect climate and disaster risk information.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $7,600,000, of which $7,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Canada. The rest will be provided by the Government of Myanmar \nin the form of counterpart staff, office space, data, maps, and other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from April 2017 to March 2021. The executing agency will \nbe  the  Ministry  of  Social  Welfare,  Relief,  and  Resettlement  (MSWRR).  The  implementing \nagencies will be MSWRR for output 1; the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation for \noutput 2; and the Ministry of Planning and Finance for output 3. TA administration will not be \ndelegated but carried out by ADB following its standard policies and procedures. Within ADB, \nthe Myanmar Resident Mission and the Southeast Asia Department will take the lead in TA \nadministration, with technical support from the Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management \nDivision, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department.  \n \n16.  A TA steering committee will be established to provide high-level policy directions for TA \nimplementation. The committee, chaired by MSWRR, will meet every quarter and will include \n                                                \n14 Examples of nonstructural, community-level investments are trainings on resilient livelihoods, disaster resilient \nconstruction techniques, capacity building for early warning systems, equipment for disaster response, ecosystem-\nbased interventions, and awareness raising on DRM and CCA.  \n ", "  5 \nthe  Department  of  Relief  and  Resettlement  and  Department  of  Social  Welfare,  MSWRR; \nDepartment of Meteorology and Hydrology, Ministry of Transport; Environmental Conservation \nDepartment, Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation; Department of \nAgriculture  and  Department  of  Rural  Development,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Livestock,  and \nIrrigation;  Planning  Department,  Budget  Department,  and  Myanma  Insurance,  Ministry  of \nPlanning and Finance; and ADB.  \n \n17.  The TA will require about 169 person-months of international and 158 person-months of \nnational consulting services with expertise in various aspects of DRM. ADB will engage the \ninternational  DRM  coordinator,  international  DRM  and  gender  specialist,  national  DRM \ncoordinator,  and  national  DRM  gender  expert  on  an  individual  basis  and  the  remaining \nconsultants  through  firms,  following  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). It is proposed to have a maximum of four packages for consulting \nfirms based on the specialized skills required. The firms will be selected following quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method,  and  using  a  simplified  or  full  technical  proposal.  Where \nappropriate, the consultants will be engaged on output-based (lump sum) contracts to reduce \nthe administrative burden and improve the TA\u2019s economy, efficiency, and value for money. The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. All TA disbursements will be \nmade following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Procedures for  equipment procurement will be agreed with the government. \nLimited international bidding or direct contracting with a specialized supplier and installer might \nbe  considered.  All  procurement  under  the  TA  will  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \n18.  All TA outputs will be disseminated through government agency websites, the ADB \ncorporate website, and workshops organized under the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,500,000 to the Republic \nof the Union of Myanmar to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Canada for \nStrengthening Climate and Disaster Resilience of Myanmar Communities, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nIncreased capacity of government for strengthening resilience, including financial resilience, to extreme weather \nevents in Myanmara \n   Performance Indicators   Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \n     \nInvestments in disaster \nClimate and disaster  a.
