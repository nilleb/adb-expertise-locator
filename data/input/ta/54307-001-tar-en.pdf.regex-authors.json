The proposal is for a policy-based loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for subprogram 1 of the Sustainable Economic Recovery \nProgram. The program focuses on sustainable economic recovery following the severe health, \nand demand and supply shocks triggered by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. It \npursues reforms in two areas: public financial management (PFM); and access to finance for the \nunderserved market segments, mainly cottage, micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises \n(CMSMEs). The PFM reforms will help create the fiscal space needed to boost investment in \ncritical physical and social infrastructure. The access to finance reforms will help revitalize \nCMSMEs, which are crucial not only for maintaining employment and livelihoods, but also in \nstrengthening production networks throughout the value chain. A programmatic approach with \ntwo subprogram loans of $250 million each from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources is proposed to \nsupport the sequential reforms that were determined in policy dialogues with the Government of \nBangladesh on post-COVID-19 economic recovery. Subprogram 1 focuses on immediate policy \nactions relating to domestic resource mobilization, expenditure management, and CMSMEs to \nfacilitate the near-term economic recovery. Subprogram 2 focuses on further advancing these \nagendas while building the capacities of the agencies involved to operationalize the reforms and \nsetting out follow-on strategy and reform actions over the medium-term. \nII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n2.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) is being processed at the request of \nthe Government of Bangladesh to support the implementation of the policy actions proposed \nunder subprogram 2 of the Sustainable Economic Recovery Program and the implementation of \nthe  post-program  partnership  framework  (PPPF).  The  results  framework,  implementation \narrangements,  cost  estimate,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  TA  were  discussed  with  the \ngovernment during the reconnaissance and fact-finding mission. \n3.  The rationale of the program is to create fiscal space for greater public investment and to \nfoster a favorable environment for the sustainable growth of CMSMEs. This will be accomplished \nby  (i) boosting  domestic  resource  mobilization;  (ii) streamlining  expenditure  management; \n(iii) strengthening PFM diagnostics; (iv) broadening access to credit for CMSMEs during the \npandemic; and (v) establishing a favorable market infrastructure for enhanced credit flows to \nCMSMEs. \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n4.  Output 1: Capacity of executing and implementing agencies strengthened, and \nimplementation of subprogram 2 supported. The TA will support the Finance Division of the \nMinistry of Finance in implementing subprogram 2 policy actions, supervising overall program \nimplementation, and implementing the PPPF. The TA team will assist (i) the National Board of \nRevenue (NBR) in drafting a new income tax code to incorporate international good practices and \naddress emerging issues such as base erosion and profit shifting by international entities, taxation \nof derivatives transactions, and thin capitalization; (ii) the Finance Division in updating the SOE \nreform strategy; (iii) the Finance Division and the NBR in developing the medium-term revenue \nstrategy;  (iv)  the  income  tax  division  in  designing  and  implementing a training  program on \nelectronic tax returns for officials and staff; (v) the NBR\u2019s income tax and value-added tax \ndivisions in devising protocols for the sharing of information on large taxpayers falling under their \n \n \n  ", "2 \ncommon jurisdiction, to improve the quality of information available while selecting candidates for \nrisk-based audits; and (vi) the Planning Commission in formulating guidelines on cost\u2013benefit \nanalyses and training programs for ministries, divisions, and agencies on rolling out new public \ninvestment management tools.  \n5.  Output 2: Guideline for value chain financing developed, and implementation of the \npartnership framework supported. The TA team will support Bangladesh Bank in formulating \na guideline for banks and financial institutions on providing value chain financing to CMSMEs. It \nwill also assist the implementation of the PPPF by evaluating the economic and social impacts of \nthe refinancing and credit guarantee schemes, and identifying new measures to further expand \ndigital credit, cluster and value chain financing, and policy and institutional reforms to remove the \nremaining binding constraints on the development of CMSMEs. \n6.  Output 3: Public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted, \nand the reform action plan updated. The TA team will support the government in conducting \nthe  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  with  additional \nassessments of the responsiveness of the PFM system to gender and climate change, and in \nrevising the PFM reform action plan, 2018\u20132023 based on the PEFA findings and recent reports \non the plan's progress. The PEFA assessment is designed to provide the government, its \ndevelopment partners, and other stakeholders with a full picture of the country's PFM system. \nThe objective is to provide a neutral and independent assessment of the government\u2019s PFM \nperformance. This is of critical importance to the government\u2019s fiscal and broader development \nobjectives. The PEFA assessment will cover the operations of the central government (including \nintergovernmental transfers to local governments). It will help the government identify remaining \nPFM weaknesses that may inhibit the realization of its strategic plans and the PFM reform efforts \ncurrently underway. The PFM Reform Strategy, 2016\u20132021 and the PFM reform action plan laid \nout the government\u2019s vision, main objectives, and high-level reform actions to be undertaken over \na 5-year period. The TA will support the government in updating these documents based on inputs \nfrom the PEFA assessment and giving it a strong strategic direction for another 3\u20135 years. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The government will provide counterpart \nstaff,  workshop  venues,  other  logistical  support,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The government was informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n8.  ADB will be the executing agency and administer the TA. The Public Management, \nFinancial Sector, and Trade Division of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the consultants. It will also act as the focal point and facilitate the consultants\u2019 inputs. \nThe program director will coordinate the TA consultants\u2019 activities with the program activities. The \nimplementation arrangements for the TA will be aligned with those of the policy-based loan (table \nbelow). The TA requires 11.5 person-months of international and 22 person-months of national \nconsulting services intermittently. The TA is estimated to begin in October 2021 and will be \nimplemented until June 2024. \n \n  ", "3 \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2021\u2013June 2024 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance, Bangladesh Bank, \nNational Board of Revenue, Financial Institutions Division, Planning \nCommission. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm: QCBS  27.5 person-months  $296,400 \n(including 5.5 person-months \ninternational) \nIndividuals: ICS  6 person-months  $116,000 \ninternational \n \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as \namended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n9.
