INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the invitation of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the \nPacific (ESCAP),1 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed to collaborate with ESCAP in \ndeveloping and implementing a regional action plan for implementing the Global Strategy for \nImproving Agricultural and Rural Statistics for enhanced food security in the Asia and Pacific \nregion. The global strategy, which was endorsed by the United Nations Statistical Commission \nin  February 2010,  provides  a  framework  within  which  national  and  international  statistical \nsystems can produce and apply basic data and information to guide decision making in the \n21st century. The strategy rests on three pillars: (i) the establishment of a minimum set of core \ndata that countries will collect to meet current and emerging demands, (ii) the integration of \nagriculture into national statistical systems to satisfy the demands of policy makers and other \nusers  who  rely  on  comparable  data  across  locations  and  time,  and  (iii) the  institution  of \nsustainable agricultural statistics systems through governance and statistical capacity building.  \n \n2.  ADB formulated this technical assistance (TA) to support this process. (The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.)2  In the planning of this TA, partner agencies\u2014the Food \nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and ESCAP\u2014and several people \nrepresenting the national statistical systems of the Philippines and Bhutan were consulted. In \naddition, ADB, other development organizations, and countries in the region will be represented \nin a steering group for agricultural statistics that was formed to spearhead the development of \nthe regional implementation plan. \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A majority of the poor in the region still live in the rural areas, and agriculture is still the \nmajor source of employment. To achieve inclusive growth, therefore, agriculture and the rural \nareas must develop and the effects on future food security of population growth, demand for \nnatural resources and competing food crop use, and extreme weather and climate change must \nbe understood. For these issues to be examined and appropriate policies to be formulated, \nthere must be accurate, reliable, and comprehensive data on agriculture and the rural areas. \nMany developing countries in Asia and the Pacific do not have the necessary data support \nsystems. \n  \n4.  Many  of  the  crop  production  data  and  other  agricultural  statistics  that  developing \nmember countries (DMCs) use come from those countries\u2019 administrative reporting systems. \nGovernment  agricultural  personnel  assess  crop  production  by  observing  harvests  and  by \ninterviewing  experts  (village  heads, farmers,  traders)  in  their  assigned  localities.  Summary \nstatistics from lower levels of government are then transmitted up the hierarchy until they reach \nthe national level. While this data collection approach is inexpensive and can provide timely \ndata, research has shown that it is prone to large measurement errors. Data collection officers \nand others involved in the process have vested interests that influence the estimation process. \nAgricultural officers tend to overestimate production in their assigned areas to support their \nclaims of accomplishment. This type of administrative reporting does not usually include a \nvalidation process that could improve the quality of estimates.  \n                                                \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n1 The invitation dated 24 May 2011 came from ESCAP\u2019s executive secretary and the chair of the committee on \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \nstatistics, a subsidiary body of ESCAP composed of heads of national statistical systems of ESCAP member \n \ncountries dedicated to the development of official statistics in Asia and the Pacific. In accepting the invitation on \n  27 June 2011, the ADB President emphasized the need to improve agriculture to achieve inclusive growth. \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 17 October 2011. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Inaccurate estimation of staple food production can lead to inappropriate policies and, \nconsequently,  unfavorable  outcomes,  and  possibly  worsening  food  security.  Because  only \naggregated statistics are available, analysis at the household level is not feasible. Households \nthat are food insecure cannot be accurately profiled and vulnerable areas identified. In general, \ndata-intensive analysis that can inform policy and contribute to better development outcomes in \nthe long term is not forthcoming.  \n \n6.  While administrative reporting systems can improve by incorporating a data validation \nprocess, the preferred data collection strategy makes use of a system of household surveys, in \nwhich agricultural data, such as crop and backyard livestock production, farming operations, \nlandholdings, and other related data items, are collected directly from sample households that \nwere objectively selected. This approach provides sound estimates, the ability to estimate \nsampling errors to gauge the quality of estimates, and, more importantly, household-level data \nfor more data-intensive analysis. However, only 16 of the 45 DMCs in the region have regular, \nnationally representative surveys for collecting agricultural statistics, and only 20 conduct an \nagriculture census every 10 years that can be used as sampling frame for surveys, to enrich \npolicy analysis and support government planning.  \n7.  The  global  strategy  recommends  the  implementation  of  a  master  sample3  as  the \npreferred method of generating agricultural and rural data of better coverage and quality. At \npresent only three DMCs maintain a master sample for their household survey system, which \ndoes not include agricultural and rural surveys. In fact, 14 of the 45 DMCs do not conduct any \nhousehold surveys at all, and 13 have irregular data collection systems that depend mostly on \nthe availability of external funding. In the 18 countries that have regular household surveys, crop \nproduction and other related statistics are usually compiled by the agriculture ministry rather \nthan by the national statistics office as part of household surveys of national coverage.  \n \n8.  For poverty assessment and reduction household surveys must be designed to provide \nreliable estimates for the urban and rural areas. While some countries with regular household \nsurvey systems derive estimates disaggregated into urban and rural components, many other \ncountries turn out official statistics without this level of disaggregation. \n     \n9.  Even  with  many  desired  features,  such  as  the  enrichment  of  data-intensive  policy \nresearch and better-quality estimates, probability sample surveys may not be a straightforward \nreplacement for administrative reporting for national statistical systems. Surveys are much more \ncostly, and because survey data go through rigorous data validation, estimates and the survey \nreport may not be available as quickly. Moreover, agricultural and rural statistics are often not \nconsidered core statistics and for that reason, are not given a regular budgetary allocation. \nExternal financing of surveys and censuses is not sustainable in the long run, however, and will \nonly  make  countries  dependent  on  external  funding.  The  government  must  therefore  be \ncommitted to producing agricultural and rural statistics at the outset. Developing countries \nshould  give  priority  to  drafting  affordable  data  collection  strategies  and  taking  innovative \napproaches to the use of remote sensing and other satellite-related technologies. \n \n10.  The sustainability of agricultural and rural statistics hinges on governments\u2019 support, \nwhich in turn is contingent on demand for these statistics. This demand is assumed to be high in \nthe global strategy paper, but it is not adequately met in many countries in Asia and the Pacific \nbecause of the poor quality and coverage of agricultural and rural statistics. Higher-quality \n                                                \n3  A sample from which subsamples can be selected to serve the needs of more than one survey or survey round. It \nis a set of sample units from which further selection may be done. \n ", "  3 \nagricultural  and  rural  statistics  can  be  invaluable  to  policy  makers  in  monitoring  their \ngovernments\u2019 development plans. Therefore, agricultural and rural statistics  must be integrated \nnot  only  into  the  countries\u2019  statistical  development  plans  but  also  into  their  economic \ndevelopment plans. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The intended impact of the proposed TA is an increase in the use of agricultural and \nrural statistics in policy making to enhance food security. The expected outcome is an increase \nin agricultural and rural statistics of better quality that are collected regularly. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will consist of three major activities: (i) regional action plan  preparation, to \nimprove agriculture and rural statistics; (ii) methodological studies; and (iii) training programs \nand workshops, to support countries in developing their own action plans.  \n \n13.  To develop the regional action plan, ESCAP and FAO have organized a steering group \nfor agricultural statistics (SGAS) in which countries in the region4 as well as ADB and other \ndevelopment organizations5 are represented. The SGAS is envisioned to provide a venue for \nbroader consultation on the development of the regional action plan and for the promotion of the \nendeavor among countries and the development community in the region.  \n \n14.  To ensure that the action plan comes with an appropriate set of development tools for \ncountries that have expressed interest in improving their agricultural and rural statistics, an \nassessment of countries in the region will be made on the basis of available information that has \nalready been collected by development organizations. The following criteria will be used in the \nassessment:  (i)  level  of  food  security,  (ii)  capability  to  conduct  household  surveys,  and \n(iii) government support for agricultural and rural statistics.  \n \n15.  Countries with well-functioning household survey systems that include agricultural and \nrural statistics will be encouraged to help other countries by sharing information about their \nstatistical methods. ADB will also work as a catalyst, soliciting the advice and participation of \nthese countries and providing a suitable collaboration mechanism for the development of the \naction plans. Administrative reporting systems and other approaches will have to be studied and \ndeveloped for countries without any household survey system at all. Surveys in these countries \nmay not be affordable and are likely to be difficult to process and analyze given the human \nresource and infrastructure constraints of the national statistics offices.  \n \n16.    Methodological research through special studies and surveys will be carried out to \ndevelop affordable data collection strategies for agricultural and rural statistics. For example, \ninstead of a new survey of farming and livestock activities, a module dealing with this topic can \nbe introduced into the household income and expenditure survey, which is one of the two \n                                                \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n4m  Aefmghbaenriss,t aBno, aAruds toraf lDiai,r eBcatnogrlsa,d Mesahn, aBgheumtane n(vt,i coer- cshtaaifrf),,  aInnddia m, Ianyd obnee spirae, lIirmanin, aJrayp ainn ,n tahteu rMea. l dives, Myanmar, the \nPhilippines (chair), Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n \n5 The Asia and Pacific Commission on Agricultural Statistics, ESCAP, FAO, the Indian Agricultural Statistics \n \nResearch  Institute,  the  International  Fund  for  Agricultural  Development,  the  Department  for  International \n  Development of the United Kingdom, and the Secretariat  for the Pacific Community. \n ", "4   \nsurveys that are most regularly conducted.6 The sampling strategies used in household survey \nsystems must be examined and, if necessary, revised to ensure that the sample sizes for the \nrural areas are adequate. ADB will also work with key government agencies on joint policy \nanalyses using available data from existing household surveys. This approach could widen the \nuser  base  for  agricultural  and  rural  statistics  and  thereby  increase  the  demand  for  these \nstatistics and secure the necessary budget appropriation from the government for this purpose.  \n \n17.  Since food security needs to be measured more frequently, food security questions can \nbe included in the survey that is most often conducted\u2014the labor force survey. This approach is \nexpected to be more cost effective than enjoining countries to conduct a new full survey round. \nSpecial studies will be done to streamline the household income and expenditure survey and \nthe labor force survey with these additional modules and not increase the response burden. \nConsultations  will  also  help  determine  data  ownership  and  reporting  responsibilities\u2014for \nexample, should the national statistics office or the ministry of agriculture compile and own the \ndata?   \n \n18.  Workshops will be held to assist in the development of the regional action plan and the \ncountry plans and to disseminate the results of the methodological research. Training programs \nin survey design and operations and in policy analysis will support the development of country \nplans and upgrade the skills of national statistical systems staff. Participation in the training \nprograms will be based on the results of the country assessment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. ADB will finance the country assessment \nand will support, where necessary (considering the results of the assessment), the development \nof the regional action plan, the conduct of methodological research, the cost of the international \nand national consulting services, and the conduct of workshops and training programs. The TA \nwill be financed with a grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014other \nsources). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA. It will collaborate closely with ESCAP, \nFAO, and SGAS members throughout the project to minimize duplication of efforts and leverage \nthe  limited  available  resources.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  18  months,  from \nDecember 2011 to June 2013.  \n \n21.  Memorandums of agreement will be drawn up with the national statistical offices that will \nconduct the methodological research. These agreements will specify the appropriate financial \nmanagement  facility,  including  the  nature  of  the  advance  payment  facility.  International \ndevelopment organizations that are active in agricultural research may be consulted as required \nduring the methodological research. National statistical offices will be encouraged to collaborate \nwith national research and academic institutions in the methodological research. \n \n22.  The  TA  will  also  finance  2  person-months  (intermittent)  of  international  and \n12 person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  ADB  will  hire  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n                                                \n6  The labor force survey is the household survey that is most frequently conducted. \n ", "  5 \n \n23.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The procurement of \nequipment, if any, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n24.
