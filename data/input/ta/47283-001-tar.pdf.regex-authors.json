This capacity development technical assistance (TA) will prepare the business strategy \nfor port development at Mal\u00e9. It will develop the overall implementation and financing strategy \nfor shifting the existing port operations onto Thilafushi island, and redeveloping the existing \nMal\u00e9 Commercial Harbour (MCH) site for higher-value-added activities with potential integration \nwith an international cruise ferry terminal. A key component of this TA is to undertake robust \nanalyses of the business and financing strategy\u2014facilitating the government\u2019s engagement with \nindustry and potential cofinanciers to develop a viable financing and implementation strategy, \ntaking into consideration phasing of developments and risk allocations.  \n \n2.  The  Maldives  country  operations  business  plan  (2013\u20132015)1 included  a  project \npreparatory TA for a transport project to be processed in 2013. During the country programming \nmission  in  July  2013,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  (MOFT)  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to use the project preparatory TA resources to develop Thilafushi \nPort and redevelop MCH. The scope of the TA was discussed and agreed during the mission. A \nmemorandum of understanding between ADB and the government was signed in July 2013, \nwhere it was agreed that the Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) would be the \nimplementing agency for the TA, the government would provide counterpart funding support of \nup to $1 million for technical surveys to support the TA, and permanent and technical staff \nwould be identified and maintained to oversee and coordinate the TA.  \n \n3.  In September 2013, ADB and MOFT agreed to utilize the resources for a capacity \ndevelopment TA rather than project preparatory TA to reflect the need to assist the government \nin developing a strategic business and financial model for the overall port development concept, \nbefore undertaking specific project preparatory studies.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Maritime  transport  is  the  economic  lifeline  of  the  Maldives  and  the  majority  of \ninternational trade occurs through MCH. The most recent physical upgrade of the port was in \n1998, when ADB assisted in the reclamation and expansion of the port as part of the Second \nMal\u00e9 Port Project.2 In December 2011, expansion of the adjacent domestic harbor\u2014Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbour\u2014was  completed  under  the  Domestic  Maritime  Transport  Project.3 From  previous \nproject  experience,  the  key  challenges  faced  in  the  Maldives  transport  sector  include \nimplementation delays, limited resources and/or funding, lack of complementary efforts with \nother sectors, and ad-hoc development of infrastructure. This TA is designed to tackle these \nchallenges and incorporate these lessons learned.  \n \n5.  The  ongoing  Maldives  Maritime  Transport  Masterplan  Project  (MTMP) 4  recently \nundertook a holistic review of the country\u2019s overall passenger and cargo infrastructure needs. In \nterms of cargo transport, the study revealed that cargo demand would increase by more than \nthree times over the next 20 years, up to 2032. However, MCH is already operating at capacity \nand congestion around Mal\u00e9 is becoming chronic. This has resulted in long passenger travel \ntimes and high cargo distribution and logistics costs. Moreover, land is very scarce on Mal\u00e9 and \nfurther physical expansion of port operations at MCH is not feasible. To meet the growing \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Maldives, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n2  ADB. 1993.

Manila. \n ", "2  \ndemand, it was recommended to shift the existing port operations onto Thilafushi island, which \nis zoned and planned for industrial development. The new location on Thilafushi also provides \nample space for port expansion plans in the longer term. Shifting the port operations from Mal\u00e9 \nto Thilafushi would also reduce conflicting movements between passenger and cargo vessels, \nimproving the passenger travel time and quality to and from Mal\u00e9. Moreover, this proposal \nwould free up prime land at the existing MCH site for redevelopment for higher-value-added \neconomic activities such as commercial development and international cruise ferry terminal \nfacilities. The proposed international cruise ferry terminal is in line with the recommendations of \nan ongoing study on the Feasibility Study of the Indian Ocean Cargo and Passenger Ferry \nService initiated by the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation.5  \n \n6.  Following the recommendations of the MTMP, this TA will develop the overall port \ndevelopment business strategy. In particular, it will conduct technical pre-feasibility studies and \ndevelop the overall financing strategy and implementation plan of the new Thilafushi port, as \nwell as redevelopment of MCH. The analyses on risk allocations and financing strategy will \nfacilitate the government\u2019s engagement with cofinanciers and potentially the private sector for \ncofinancing opportunities. During the course of the TA, the existing institutional and regulatory \nframeworks  would  also  be  reviewed  and  strengthened  to  enhance  project  readiness  for \nimplementing future projects.  \n \n7.  As a port development initiative, the TA also contributes significantly to the Regional \nCooperation Strategy in South Asia, 2011\u201320156 by strengthening connectivity and economic \nintegration  between  the  Maldives  and  the  rest  of  South  Asia.  The  objective  of  improving \nsubregional connectivity and promoting intraregional trade in South Asia is aligned with the \nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation objectives of promoting greater interactions \nbetween peoples, and facilitating enhanced investment and trade in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be an enabling environment for strong partnership among the \ngovernment, private sector, and cofinanciers in ports development. The outcome of the TA will \nbe a port development plan for Mal\u00e9 and Thilafushi approved. This will include the indicative \nterm sheets of legal agreements between the government and developers. The target will be to \nobtain official approval and commitment from the government by 2015 to implement the port \ndevelopment plan.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  A key feature of the TA is to assist the government in developing the port development \nplan in consultation with developers, including potential cofinanciers and the private sector. \nInvolving these delivery partners at the outset would ensure that the business and financing \nstrategy  is  robust  and  realistic.  The  engagement  of  these  stakeholders  in  developing  the \nimplementation plan will ensure feasible phasing of the developments, and more accurate and \nappropriate risk allocation in future commercial contracts to implement the project components.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2011.

During  the  TA  implementation,  financial  management  assessments  will  also  be \nconducted  on  potential  delivery  partners.  This  will  ensure  that  the  necessary  support  for \ninstitutional and capacity strengthening is put in place to enhance readiness for future projects.   \n \n11.  Estimates for constructing a new port on Thilafushi island were developed from the \nMTMP. This TA will refine the cost estimates based on initial bathymetric, geotechnical, and \nenvironmental surveys to be funded by the government during the course of the TA.  \n \n12.  Given the environmentally sensitive nature of the marine biodiversity around the overall \nport development site, the TA will undertake an initial scoping study of potential environmental \nimpacts to assess the impact of port development on the marine environment, as well as \nexisting environmental problems on the island that may affect the proposed port project. In \nparticular, the TA will also assess the suitability of operating the new port adjacent to the \nexisting landfill site on Thilafushi.  \n \n13.  Initial climate  risk  screening  for  the  port  development  sites  on  Mal\u00e9  and  Thilafushi \nrevealed that the proposed sites are susceptible to rising sea level and risk of tsunami. These \nrisks will be taken into account in the pre-feasibility design and cost estimates will be developed \nduring the course of the TA.    \n        \n14.  The TA outputs and their respective key activities are listed below. \n \n15.  Output 1: Business and financial model for overall port development completed. \nThis output will (i) identify redevelopment options for the existing MCH; (ii) undertake market \nanalyses  (including  international  cargo  demand,  cruise  passenger,  and  future  commercial \ndemand) to create a business model for overall port development; (iii) assist the government in \nexploring  alternative  and  sustainable  financing  strategies  with  industry  and  potential \ncofinanciers to develop a viable financing strategy; and (iv) develop cost estimates of each \nproject component. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Implementation  and  financing  strategy  completed. This output will (i) \nassess the economic and financial viability of incremental development phases for the overall \nport development project; (ii) conduct stakeholder analysis and engagement workshops with the \ngovernment and delivery partners to develop feasible implementation phases; (iii) undertake \nfinancial management assessments of key delivery partners, and propose capacity building \nmeasures to strengthen financial management, anticorruption, and procurement processes to \nimplement proposals; (iv) assess the legal and institutional framework of relevant stakeholders \nand develop and implement a program to strengthen the legal and institutional framework; \n(v) for  project  components  within  the  overall  port  development  plan,  undertake  initial \nassessment of the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people safeguards \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  government  policies;  and  (vi) \ndevelop phasing of project components. \n \n17.  Output 3: Pre-feasibility study of constructing a new port on Thilafushi island \ncompleted. This output will (i) undertake technical pre-feasibility design for Thilafushi port; (ii) \ndevelop preliminary cost estimates using least-cost analysis and risk analysis; and (iii) identify \nrisk management measures for climate change and environmental impacts that need to be \nconsidered during implementation.  \n \n ", "4  \n18.  The  critical  assumptions  are  (i)  continued  commitment  by  government  to  improve \nmaritime infrastructure, (ii) MOFT and MOTC make timely decisions regarding implementation, \nand (iii) counterpart staff are fully involved and share ownership of the TA outputs.  \n \n19.  Key deliverables include the port development business plan; implementation plan for \nport development; and reports on stakeholder analysis and pre-feasibility for priority investment, \nsafeguard documents, and climate change assessment. At least two workshops will be held \nduring the TA, and the firm will submit inception, midterm, and final reports.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost up to $1,750,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-V).  The  government  will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  technical  surveys,  office  space,  domestic \ntransportation,  communications  and  logistic  support  to  the  TA  team,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.  Equipment  and  assets  purchased  under  the  work  will  adhere  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Upon completion of the project, \nthe assets will be turned over to the implementing agency. The detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n21.  During  the  Country  Programming  Mission  (CPM)  in  July  2013,  a  Memorandum  of \nUnderstanding  was  signed  between  the  government  and  ADB,  where  the  government \ncommitted  to  finance  and  undertake  initial  technical  surveys  \u2013  including  bathymetry, \ngeotechnical and environmental - in support for this TA.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  MOFT will be the executing agency and the MOTC will be the implementing agency. A \nfull-time project director from the MOTC will be assigned to oversee day-to-day implementation \nof the TA. Satisfying the commitment in the memorandum of understanding to put in place \npermanent  technical  staff,  the  government  has  established  a  new  team\u2014the  Policy  and \nPlanning Section\u2014under the MOTC to oversee implementation of this TA from inception to \ncompletion. The MOTC is preparing for mobilization of technical surveys by February 2014. To \nensure close coordination on cross-agency issues, the project director will form a technical \ncommittee consisting of key stakeholders, including state-owned enterprises such as Thilafushi \nCorporation Limited (TCL) and Maldives Ports Limited (MPL). TCL is responsible for developing \nThilafushi island, and MPL is the port operator for the existing MCH. Under the TA, the financial \nmanagement capacities of the potential agencies involved in implementing the components \nwithin the port development plan would be assessed.  \n \n23.  The TA consultants will be mobilized from March 2014 to February 2015. The firm will \nhave extensive experience in successfully developing and implementing similar large-scale \nmaritime  infrastructure,  and  will  provide  technical  expertise  in  maritime  infrastructure \ndevelopment, finance, institutional development, transport economics, environment, and social \nsafeguards, as well as climate change. Nine experts will provide an estimated 37.4 person-\nmonths of consultancy (20.4 international and 17 national) over 12 months. The outline terms of \nreference for the international firm are in Appendix 3.   \n \n24.  ADB will engage the international firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using quality-and cost-based selection and a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. This is necessary to engage a good quality firm to deliver a viable \n ", "  5\nbusiness  strategy  and  implementation  plan  for  this  large-scale  and  complex  maritime \ninfrastructure investment in the Maldives.
