INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Dialogue between the Government of Viet Nam and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nhas highlighted the importance of providing timely and continued support to the government to \nimprove project financial management under decentralization. During the country programming \nconfirmation  mission  in  February  2012,  the  government  confirmed  its  request  for  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  ADB  for  the  Supporting  Project  Financial \nManagement Decentralization (Phase 3).1 The concept paper for the TA was approved on 12 \nMarch 2012. An ADB fact-finding mission fielded from 21 March to 2 April 2012 to prepare the \nTA  reached  an  understanding  with  the  government  on  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Since Viet Nam\u2019s attainment of the status of a middle-income country in 2010, its access \nto traditional concessional official development assistance (ODA) has diminished. ADB and the \ngovernment  recognize,  however,  that  continued  growth  and  poverty  reduction  through  the \nsuccessful implementation of the 5-year Socio-Economic Development Plan, 2011\u20132015 will \nrequire costly structural reform and significant infrastructure investments to address bottlenecks. \nFaced with the increasing cost of finance and growing investment needs, the government must \nimprove the efficiency of externally financed public investments. This will entail improvements to \nthe project financial management in the central government and local governments alike and \nenhanced external debt management that mitigates the risks of external borrowing. \n \n3.  Increasing the economic and social returns on public investments requires building the \ncapacity of government officials responsible for the financial appraisal of investment projects.  \nCurrently, central and local government officials lack the capacity to conduct by themselves \neffective project financial analysis. To strengthen their ownership of projects and programs, they \nneed  to  improve  their  knowledge  and  skills  regarding  project  financial  analysis,  especially \ntoward  improving  the  efficiency  and  viability  of  proposed  investments.  Improving  such \nknowledge and skills is also critical for government officials responsible for appraising and \napproving projects.  Additionally, the lack of clear guidelines on project financial preparation and \nappraisal,  and  the  fragmented  legal  framework  for  financial  management  during  project \nimplementation, further made it difficult for staff to properly and consistently conduct project \nfinancial management. \n \n4.  Under new conditions as a middle-income country, the Government of Viet Nam is \ncommitted to the continued improvement of the legal and institutional framework for effectively \nmanaging external borrowings in line with the Law on Public Debt Management, which was \ndeclared effective on 1 January 2010. The Prime Minister issued Decision 106/QD-TTg of 19 \nJanuary 2012 on Approval of the Strategic Framework for Attracting, Managing, and Utilizing \nODA and Other Concessional Sources from 2011 to 2015.3 In line with Decision 106/QD-TTg, \n                                                \n1  The TA is the third in a series of TA supporting project financial management through decentralization. The first TA \nis for Improving Project Financial Management through Decentralization. ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for Improving Project Financial Management through Decentralization. Manila (TA \n3722-VIE). The second TA is for Supporting Financial Management Decentralization. ADB. 2007. Technical \nAssistance to Viet Nam for Supporting Financial Management Decentralization. Manila (TA 7051-VIE).  \n2  The TA first appeared in the Business Opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 September 2012 \n3  Decision  106/QD-TTg  guides  the  mobilization,  utilization,  and  management  of  ODA  that  is  conventionally \nconcessional, like that of the Asian Development Fund and the International Development Association, and \n ", "2  \nthe  government  plans  to  amend  various  decrees,  circulars,  and  regulations,  which  will \nsignificantly affect the mobilization and management of ODA and other, less-concessional funds. \nSpecifically,  the  government  is  currently  amending  Decree  131/2006/ND/CP,  on  ODA \nmanagement and utilization, to cover both ODA and less-concessional funds and incorporate \nrecent recommendations toward improving the management and utilization of ODA and less-\nconcessional funds. Recent improvements to the legal and regulatory framework for ODA and \nless-concessional funds require further refinements to the legal framework and procedures for \nproject financial management.  \n \n5.  Since 2000, ADB had provided assistance to the government through TA for Improving \nProject Financial Management through Decentralization (footnote 1) and TA for Supporting \nFinancial Management Decentralization (footnote 1). The government greatly appreciated the \nmanual  on  financial  issues  of  ODA  projects  developed  under  the  earlier  TA  and  several \nrecommendations made under the latter TA. Nevertheless, changes in circumstances require \nthat the manual be updated and improved in line with the government\u2019s latest regulations on \nODA  and  less-concessional  borrowing.  Additionally,  the  government\u2019s  fragmented  legal \ndocuments  governing  the  financial  management  of  ODA  and  less-concessional  borrowing \nrequire refinement and consolidation.  \n \n6.  The country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 confirms the need to respond to the \nchanging requirements of the country\u2019s long-term growth and development and to strengthen \nportfolio performance.4  ADB\u2019s newly approved country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 cites \nthe strategic thrust to support Viet Nam\u2019s transition to status as an upper-middle-income country \nthrough three pillars: inclusive growth, environmental sustainability, and improved efficiency.5  In \nline with the country operations business plan and the country partnership strategy, the TA will \nhelp the government enhance the efficiency of externally financed public investments and, in \nparticular, strengthen the government\u2019s effective mobilization and utilization of ADB resources \nby (i) enhancing the capacity of government staff involved in project financial management, \nspecifically in the financial preparation and appraisal of projects to optimize the utilization of \nborrowed funds and ensure debt repayment, and (ii) helping the government develop a manual \non the financial management of ODA and less-concessional borrowing, as well as sector-\nspecific guidelines on the financial preparation and appraisal of ADB-funded investment projects. \nSupport from ADB is critical to the government\u2019s effective and sustainable use of overseas \nborrowings in general and ADB assistance in particular. It fully aligns with an evaluation study \nrecommendation to provide project-level capacity-building support in the sectors and subsectors \nwhere  project  preparation  and  implementation  are  decentralized.6 The  TA  is  necessary  to \nprovide continuity in ADB\u2019s support to the government in project financial management under \nViet Nam\u2019s new circumstances. The TA will build on the results achieved in previous TA projects, \nfurther institutionalize and mainstream procedures for managing project finances, and develop \ntools and provide the necessary capacity building for better project financial management.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nsources that are less concessional but still concessional by the government\u2019s definition, such as ADB ordinary \ncapital resources and the International Bank of Reconstruction and Development. \n4  ADB. 2011.

The impact of the TA will be the more effective utilization of ADB resources by the \nGovernment of Viet Nam. The outcome of the TA will be improved financial preparation and \nmanagement of ADB-funded projects in Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities   \n8.  To achieve the expected outcome, the TA will deliver three outputs: (i) sector-specific \nguidelines on project financial preparation and appraisal for ADB-funded investment projects, \n(ii) a well-defined and streamlined manual on financial management issues of ODA and less-\nconcessional borrowing, and (iii) skills and knowledge of government staff on project financial \nmanagement enhanced, particularly regarding project financial preparation and appraisal. By \nfocusing on improving the financial preparation and management of ADB-funded projects, the \nTA will complement TA for Support to Improve Portfolio Performance and Aid Effectiveness, \nfocusing on improving the performance of ADB-funded projects in Viet Nam.7  \n9.  The TA will undertake a series of workshops and seminars for consultation and to \ndisseminate TA-generated products. To facilitate the issuance of the guidelines and manual \nunder outputs 1 and 2, and to support capacity building under output 3, consultation workshops \nwill be conducted with key stakeholders and development partners to discuss the draft TA \nproducts  and related training  materials.  Meetings  with  line  agencies,  local  authorities,  and \nproject management units at different levels will be organized for the consultants and the \nworking group in the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to ensure a practical approach to generating TA \nproducts. Capacity building is an important component of the TA. To ensure the sustainability of \nthe project, trainers will be trained and the MOF will regularly update digital files of the TA \nproducts and advise stakeholders of the updates. TA outputs and main activities to achieve \neach output are provided below. \n10.  Output 1: Sector-specific guidelines on financial preparation and appraisal for \nADB-funded  investment  projects  developed.  Guidelines  on  financial  preparation  and \nappraisal for ADB-funded investment projects will be developed under the TA and based on a \nreview of government\u2019s regulations and procedures on project financial analysis and appraisal, \nADB guidelines on Financial Management and Analysis of Projects,8 and hands-on experience \nin selecting and preparing ADB-funded investment projects in Viet Nam and in other lower-\nmiddle-income  countries.  It  will  provide  the  basic  concepts,  indicators,  principles,  and \nprocedures of the financial analysis of ADB-funded investment projects including project cost \nestimates, financial planning, and financial cost\u2013benefit analyses. As investments in each sector \nwill  have  different  objectives,  designs,  and  implementation  approaches,  the  guidelines  will \n                                                \n7  ADB.  2011.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Socialist  Republic  of  Viet  Nam  for  Support  to  Improve  Portfolio \nPerformance and Aid Effectiveness. Manila (TA 8034-VIE). The TA was approved in December 2011. ADB is \ncurrently processing a TA loan to Viet Nam for a project preparation and startup support facility (PPSSF) to enable \nthe Government of Viet Nam and its ministries and agencies to better prepare, start up, and implement projects, \ntoward the improved effectiveness of ODA-funded projects in Viet Nam. The PPSSF will provide financial and \ncapacity-building support to fast-track the preparation and implementation of ADB-funded projects in Viet Nam. \nThis TA will focus on improving the financial preparation and management of ADB-funded projects. ADB will \ncoordinate the implementation of this TA, TA for improved portfolio performance and aid effectiveness, and the \nPPSSF to ensure that capacity building in central government ministries and local governments is complementary \nand effective. \n8  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila \n ", "4  \nprovide examples specific to sectors. The guidelines will be a reference for government officials \ninvolved  in  preparing  and  appraising  ADB-funded  projects,  helping  them  to  analyze  more \nproactively,  independently,  and  effectively  the  financial  aspects  of  ADB-funded  investment \nprojects  and  optimally  select  them.  Additionally,  the  guidelines  will  provide  checklists  for \nfinancial analyses and appraisals, including summaries of financial analysis and review steps \nand benchmarks on financial indicators that government staff can refer to for demonstrating and \nensuring the financial viability of the projects. Financial indicators are to be reviewed and \nupdated as necessary throughout the project cycle to ensure early warning of project problems \nand timely corrective action. TA consultants will help develop the guidelines in consultation with \nstakeholders. \n \n11.  Output 2: A well-defined and streamlined manual on financial management issues \nof ODA and less-concessional borrowing developed. The manual on financial management \nissues generated under the TA will cover financial issues at different stages of the project cycle, \nincluding budget planning, disbursement, expenditure control, project accounting and auditing, \nprocessing  changes  in  financial  allocations  during  project  implementation,  preparing  final \naccounts,  project  asset  management,  and  taxation  and  related  issues.  It  will  update  and \nimprove  the manual generated  under the TA for  Improving  Project  Financial  Management \nthrough Decentralization (footnote 1) and incorporate recommendations made under the TA for \nSupporting Financial Management Decentralization (footnote 1). TA consultants will help review \nand incorporate updated regulations and procedures from the government and development \npartners alike. The manual will be a reference clarifying various procedures and processes in \nproject financial management that government staff will be able to use toward the consistent \nand sound financial management of ODA and less-concessional borrowing.  \n12.  Output  3:  Skills  and  knowledge  of  government  staff  on  project  financial \nmanagement  enhanced,  particularly  regarding  project  financial  preparation  and \nappraisal. Under this output, the TA will support the training of at least 350 government staffers. \nTraining materials will be developed using the guidelines and manual generated under outputs 1 \nand 2. Trainers will be trained to ensure the sustainability of the project. The first batch of \ncourses will target central and local government staff involved in preparing and appraising ADB-\nfunded projects. The second batch of courses will be conducted for government staff in project \nfinancial management in general. Piloted training courses in project financial management will \nbe conducted for the staff of ADB-funded projects in selected sectors.  \n13.  As the executing agency, MOF will work closely with line ministries, local authorities, and \nproject management units to nominate staff to participate in the training-of-trainers courses and \nensure that the trained staff efficiently disseminate the skills and knowledge acquired through \ntrainings. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, of which $580,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide in-\nkind counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation, \nand administrative and logistic support. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix \n2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n ", "  5\n15.  MOF will, as the executing agency, assign a vice minister to guide implementation and \nestablish a project management unit to oversee implementation. The representative of the \nExternal Finance & Debt Management Department will be the director of project management \nunit and focal point for coordinating TA activities. A working group of officials from MOF will be \nestablished to work with the TA consultants during implementation. The working group will meet \nquarterly or as required to monitor TA implementation progress and ensure that TA objectives \nare achieved. ADB representatives will be invited to the meetings if necessary.  \n16.  The TA will require 6 person-months of international consultant inputs and 20 person-\nmonths of national consultant inputs. An international consultant will be required for project \nfinancial management including project financial preparation, financial analysis and appraisal, \nand developing models for effective project financial management. Two national consultants will \nbe required. Consultants will be engaged individually in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will prepare and submit the following reports and \ndocuments to MOF and ADB: (i) an inception report 1 month after fielding, (ii) an interim report \n3\u20134 months after fielding, and (iii) draft and final completion reports upon TA completion, \ncovering TA implementation and impact.  \n17.  The disbursement of TA proceeds will be managed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time) using an advance \npayment facility.
