I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment in ShoreCap II Limited (the fund) of up to $10 million, not to exceed 25% of \nthe fund\u2019s total capital commitments, whichever is less, and not resulting in ADB being the \nsingle largest investor in the fund. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Economic and Sector Background1 \n2.  Emerging market financial institutions are growing at a rapid rate. However, this rate of \ngrowth is not sufficient to accommodate the demand for capital and banking products, which is \ngrowing at a far greater rate throughout developing markets. Asian and African microfinance \ninstitutions (MFIs) and small business banks (SBBs) that are able to attract investment capital \ncommensurate with their potential size can increase their assets, expand their product lines, \nand  improve  their  operational  efficiency  and  management  capabilities  to  capitalize  on  the \ndevelopment that is taking place around them. The fund is being established to invest in MFIs \nand SBBs that lend to poor and under-banked populations in the developing markets of Asia \nand Africa.  \n \n3.  Microfinance institutions. MFIs provide financial services (loans, savings accounts, \ninsurance, etc.) to poor and underserved or under-banked populations in developing economies. \nOne of the most popular microfinance products has been \u2015microcredit,\u2016 or relatively small loans \nthat range from as little as $50 to several thousand dollars, and can even include amounts that \nare substantially higher. The borrowers are microenterprises that use the funds to establish or \nexpand  small-scale  businesses.  The  microlending  modality  has  been  highly  successful  in \nextending finance to previously economically disenfranchised people.2 According to the State of \nthe  Microcredit  Summit  Campaign  Report  2009,  3,552  MFIs  reported  reaching  more  than \n154 million  clients  worldwide  at  the  end  of  2007.3   However,  the  target  population  for \nmicrofinance services (individuals living on less than $2 per day and generally operating in the \ninformal economy) is estimated at about 500 million families (nearly 3 billion people). The \nsupply\u2013demand gap for microfinance is thus still huge.4  \n \n4.  Asian microfinance institutions. Asian MFIs, leveraging high staff productivity and \noperating  in  densely  populated  regions,  dominate  the  global  market  in  scale  and  reach. \nBangladesh, in particular, has managed to reach 35% of the country\u2019s poor, while MFIs in Sri \nLanka and Viet Nam serve 25% of those countries' poor.5 In 2006, Asian MFIs served more \nthan 35 million borrowers and took savings from 47 million depositors. Several individual Asian \nMFIs serve several million clients each. However, many potential microfinance clients continue \nto lack access to basic financial services. Even in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam, which \nhave some of the highest microfinance penetration rates among the poor, 65% of the poor \n                                                \n1  Unless otherwise noted, market information (particularly on the small business banking sector) is derived from fund \nmanager's information memorandum.

Private Placement Memorandum: Investing in \nFinancial Institutions Supporting Small Businesses and Microenterprises in Developing Transitional Economies. \nChicago.  \n2  Non-credit services provided by MFIs, such as savings accounts and insurance also have powerful potential to \nenhance low-income persons' social and economic security by helping them build assets and protect against \nunforeseen crises.  \n3  Microcredit  Summit  Campaign.  2009.  State  of  the  Microcredit  Campaign  Report  2009.  https://promujer.org/ \nespanol/dynamic/our_publications_5_Pdf_EN_SOCR2009%20English.pdf \n4  CGAP. Global Estimates. http://www.cgap.org/p/site/c/template.rc/1.11.1792/  \n5  It should be noted that microfinance penetration can be measured in several ways; this statistic is specific to the \npercentage of poor people served, rather than the percentage of the overall population served. \n ", "2     \n \npopulation in Bangladesh and 75% of the poor population in Sri Lanka and Viet Nam are left \nunserved. In Cambodia and Indonesia, MFIs have reached only 10% of potential clients, while \nin Afghanistan, India, and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), the number is significantly \nsmaller.6 The highly concentrated nature of microfinance in Asia underscores this point. Of the \ntotal  number  of  borrowers  of  the  more  than  300  MFIs  worldwide  that  reported  to  the \nMicroFinance  Information  eXchange  in  2005,  more  than  50%  belonged  to  three  giants  of \nmicrofinance\u2014Bank  Rakyat  Indonesia,  BRAC  Bank,  and  ASA.7 Demand  for  microfinance \nproducts in Asia continues to far outstrip supply, pointing to a need for more and larger MFIs.  \n \n5.  Funding for Asian microfinance institutions. Asian MFIs tend to use substantial debt \n(primarily commercial debt) to fund their businesses. Debt\u2013equity ratios in the region average \nabout  4.9:1;  the  global  median  is  3.2:1.  As  noted  in  the  Asia  Microfinance  Analysis  and \nBenchmarking Report 2008, \u2015while the global norm for microfinance is the highly capitalized \nMFI, the median Asian MFI held capital equivalent to just 15.2% of its asset base. This small \ncapital cushion was 40% smaller than that of MFIs in Africa, Eastern Europe/Central Asia and \nLatin America and the Caribbean, where institutional capital backs a quarter of total assets.\u20168 \nThis indicates that many institutions have thin capital bases and will need additional equity to \nbolster profit margins and increase retained earnings. \n \n6.  In its 2008 report, the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) stated that total \nfunding commitments to microfinance were $14.8 billion, with $3.65 billion allocated to South \nAsia and $1.1 billion to East Asia and the Pacific. Nearly two-thirds of this total was in the form \nof debt, with grants comprising 17%; equity represented only 11% of the total.9 The percentages \nof equity financing in South Asia and East Asia were lower still, with only 1% of South Asian \nfinancing and 10% of East Asian financing coming in the form of equity commitments.10 Indeed, \nthe  CGAP  noted  wide  variation  in  how  much  private  sector  foreign  investment  flows  into \nmicrofinance in different parts of the world. It further noted that \u2015the reality is that the bulk of \nforeign investment is going to the top 150 MFIs in about 30 countries and two regions: Latin \nAmerica and Eastern Europe and Central Asia account for 75% of cross-border [private sector] \ncapital flows. Africa and Asia, where poverty and potential microfinance demand is highest, \nreceive only 6% and 7% of foreign investment, respectively.\u201611  \n \n7.  Investment  opportunity.  The  huge  need  for  microfinance  services  described  in \nparas. 2\u20136, combined with the prevailing lack of equity capital available to MFIs, creates an \ninvestment niche for the fund. At least 40% of the \u2015investment-ready\u2016 MFIs are believed to be in \nthe fund's target regions,12 with the number of target investment opportunities expected to grow \nas more nongovernment organizations transition into commercial banks. The most attractive \ninvestment opportunities for the fund in the MFI space are (i) potential consolidation among one \nor more MFIs in rapidly growing markets; (ii) increased capital needs for branch expansion or \nregulatory compliance; (iii) transformation of nongovernment organizations and rural banks into \n                                                \n6  International Finance Corporation.

", "  3 \ncommercial banks; and (iv) downscaling within the commercial banking sector through creation \nof separate microfinance departments or business units. \n \n8.  Small and medium-sized enterprises. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \naccount for a large percentage of all economic activity in developing economies and are a major \nsource of non-farm income and employment. According to the World Bank Institute, \u2015in low-\nincome countries with GDP per capita between $100 and $500, SMEs account for more than \n60% of GDP and 70% of total employment; in middle-income countries they produce close to \n70%  of  GDP  and  95%  of  total  employment.  Even  within  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-\noperation  and  Development  (OECD)  countries,  SMEs  comprise  the  majority  of  firms  and \ncontribute over 55% of GDP and 65% of total employment.\u2016 For any firm\u2014from the smallest \nmicroenterprise to the largest corporation\u2014to thrive, it needs a functional business environment, \nwith  low  legal  and  regulatory  burdens,  a  liberal  banking  and  financial  sector,  and  stable \nmacroeconomic conditions. However, key to growth for SMEs, which are generally more credit-\nconstrained than larger firms, is access to credit. According to the World Bank Institute, \u2015the \nWorld Development Report 2005 indicates that small firms obtain only 19% of their financing \nfrom external sources while large firms meet up to 44% of their financing needs through external \nsources.\u201613  \n \n9.  Small business banks. As the most successful microenterprises expand, they require \ngrowth capital beyond what MFIs and microfinance programs can provide. (For the fund\u2019s \npurposes, the small business segment includes enterprises that are too large for traditional \nMFIs, but too small to be eligible for conventional bank financing.) In many developing countries, \nsmall firms have even less access to medium- and long-term loans and other financial services \nthan microenterprises and self-employed individuals do. The fund manager, Equator Capital \nPartners (ECP, paras. 20 and 22), believes that this capital gap is partially caused by too few \nlending institutions targeting small businesses. \n \n10.  Fortunately, the number of specialized small business financial institutions is on the rise \nas small business financing becomes more of a priority for governments desiring a strong \nbuilding  block  for  their  countries\u2019  economic  expansion,  and  for  banks  seeking  bottom-line \nimprovements  via  the  higher  returns  on  assets  generated  by  SME  portfolios.  No  source \nprovides frequently updated data on the number of existing SBBs, but estimates indicate that at \nleast 500 SBBs operate in the fund's target regions. Based on the fund manager\u2019s experience in \nAfrica and Asia, SBBs' demand for equity capital far outstrips the supply. Banks that have small \nbusiness lending operations will need equity to expand their business lines, while banks that \nlack this product will require substantial equity to launch competitive small business banking \nunits. The fund will be well-positioned to fill the emerging demand for equity among SBBs.  \n \n11.  Competitive  landscape.  Worldwide,  at  least  100  investment  vehicles  specialize  in \nmicrofinance.14 A number of these are relatively small (less than $25 million), and the majority \nare concentrated in Latin America, Central Asia, and Eastern Europe.15 The fund manager \nbelieves that investment opportunities still abound in microfinance, especially in sub-Saharan \nAfrica and Asia, where microfinance investment vehicles dedicate only 8% (in sub-Saharan \nAfrica)  and  7%  (in  Asia)  of  their  portfolio  investments.16 Indeed,  of  the  101  microfinance \ninvestment funds that exist globally, only about 10 funds would directly compete with the fund. \nThe fund manager's experience, track record, and integrated capacity-building approach to \n                                                \n13  World Bank.

Investment Identification and Description \n12.  In 2004, ADB made a $2.5 million investment in ShoreCap International (ShoreCap I\u2014\nthe fund manager's first fund).17 In June 2007, ADB provided ShoreCap Exchange (SCE), the \nfund's  nonprofit capacity-building  affiliate,  with a technical  assistance  grant  of $300,000 to \nsupport its ongoing activities.18 ADB has supported the fund manager since its 2004 investment \nin ShoreCap I and maintains a close relationship with its management through both ShoreCap I \nand SCE, and thus was a natural prospective investor in the new fund. Other microfinance \nequity funds might also be worthy investment targets, but based on the positive economic and \ndevelopment outcomes of the ShoreCap I investment, ADB feels confident providing ongoing \nsupport to the fund manager. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n13.  Alignment  with  Strategy  2020.  ADB's  Strategy  2020 19  identifies  private  sector \ndevelopment as a key driver of change in Asia, and financial sector development as one of five \ncore specializations that support the bank's agenda. Strategy 2020 states that \"development of \nthe finance sector is essential to ensuring sustainable private sector-led economic growth.\"20 \nThe document also clearly identifies key constraints to developing DMC capital markets and \nfinancial systems. \"[The real economy of the region] is led by the private entities, which need \nrisk capital, particularly for start-up companies and small and medium-sized enterprises. The \nunderdeveloped capital market limits investment for projects with long gestation periods\u2026\"21 \nStrategy  2020  thus  highlights  the  absence  of  risk  capital  as  a  constraint  to  the  balanced \ndevelopment of capital markets and financial systems in the region. By supporting this fund, \nADB will be supporting the vision enshrined in Strategy 2020 of developing financial systems \nthroughout the region. \n \n14.  Alignment with the Poverty Reduction Strategy. ADB's central mission of reducing \npoverty includes implementation of strategies to (i) promote microfinance, (ii) support SMEs, (iii) \nenhance financial markets, and (iv) encourage private-sector-led initiatives to address these \ngoals. This project will directly address all three key elements of ADB's Poverty Reduction \nStrategy:  (i)  pro-poor,  sustainable  economic  growth  (through  loans  to  micro  and  small \nenterprises provided by the fund's investee MFIs and SBBs; (ii) social development (by ensuring \nthat investee institutions reach out to poor and underserved areas of their economies and \nembrace  socially  sound  practices);  and  (iii)  good  governance  (a  core  part  of  the  fund\u2019s \ninvestment strategy is that it will take an active role in promoting good governance within \ninvestee institutions). \n \n15.  Alignment with microfinance sector strategy and activities. In 2000, ADB approved \nthe Microfinance Development Strategy,22 which provides a comprehensive framework to guide \nADB's microfinance operations. The strategy states that \"strong retail institutions committed to \noutreach and sustainability are essential for extending the permanent reach of financial services \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2004.

Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. ", "  5 \nand to have a significant impact on poverty reduction. Thus, building the capacity of institutions \nwith a commitment to reach the poor is vital.\" The fund's objectives of investing in strong retail \nMFIs and SBBs, and building capacity through the activities of SCE (para. 39) are fully aligned \nwith the Microfinance Development Strategy. The themes articulated in ADB's Private Sector \nDevelopment Strategy23 are similarly consistent with the fund's activities; the strategy prioritizes \nthe promotion of efficient financial markets\u2014particularly sound financial intermediaries such as \nbanks. Related to this effort, and as part of its Poverty Reduction Strategy, ADB seeks to \npromote \"sound and efficient banking systems and capital markets,\" since these are seen as \n\"indispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and ensuring availability of long-\nterm financing, as essential requirements for pro-poor growth.\" This project aligns well with \nADB's prior investment with the fund manager to promote microfinance and SME lending, and \nthe above-mentioned ADB sector strategies, and represents a good fit for ADB's involvement. \nThe proposed investment is also complementary to a proposed microfinance risk participation \nprogram  currently  under  processing.  Under  this  program,  ADB  further  seeks  to  promote \ndevelopment through the expansion of commercial bank lending to MFIs in ADB's DMCs, in turn \nproviding an increase in provision of financial services to the underserved poor population \nsegment.  \n \nD.  Development Impact \n \n16.  ADB's  mission  is  to reduce  poverty  in  DMCs,  and  each  intervention  that  the  bank \nundertakes should relate\u2014directly or indirectly, immediately or over the long-term\u2014to achieving \nthat mission. In this transaction, ADB's investment in the fund is ultimately intended to help \nincrease the economic contribution of microfinance clients and small businesses to growth in \nthe region, to increase access to finance by women entrepreneurs, and to improve corporate \ngovernance at SBBs and MFIs. As detailed in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix \n1), the project will link to these goals as follows: \n \n(i)  Impact. The impacts of the project will be increased economic contribution to \nAsia and the Pacific by MFIs and SBBs; greater reach to underserved clients \n(i.e., women and rural clients); and improved corporate governance at SBBs and \nMFIs.  \n(ii)  Outcome. The outcome will be expanded and improved access to finance for \nMFIs and SBBs in DMCs.  \n(iii)  Output. The project output will be the establishment of the fund and its policies \nas outlined in this proposal.  \n \n17.  Specifically, the proposed equity investment will promote development in several ways, \nincluding (i) providing equity support for SBBs and MFIs, which will help leverage more funds \nfrom the commercial market; (ii) building capacity at investee institutions (via SCE, described \nbelow)  to  better  service  SMEs  and  microenterprises  in  DMCs,  thereby  contributing  to  the \ndevelopment of robust financial institutions and promoting good corporate governance at SBBs \nand MFIs; and (iii) providing ADB with opportunities to learn valuable lessons from the fund's \ninvestments in similar projects in Africa.  \nIII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Sponsor and Ownership \n18.  Sponsor. The fund\u2019s original sponsor was ShoreBank Corporation (SBK). Founded in \n1973 and headquartered in Chicago,  SBK is a regulated bank holding company with four \n                                                \n23 ADB. 2000. Private Sector Development Strategy. Manila \n ", "6     \n \nsubsidiaries  including  ShoreBank  (ShoreBank  Midwest,  their  mission-driven  Midwestern \nregional community development bank serving underprivileged markets in Chicago, Detroit, and \nCleveland),  and  ShoreCap  Management  (SCM,  the  fund  manager).    Already  operating  in \nunderprivileged  parts  of  the  United  States  (US),  ShoreBank  Midwest  experienced  serious \ndifficulties  during  the  2008\u20132009  financial  crisis,  and  was  ultimately  closed  by  the  Illinois \nDepartment  of  Financial  &  Professional  Regulation  in  August  2010.    In  response  to  the \ndifficulties faced by its parent, SCM established a new and independent fund management \nentity.  SCM  has  thus  been  replaced  by  Equator  Capital  Partners (ECP),  a  newly  created \nindependent fund management company 100% owned by its management. \n \nB.  Governance Structure \n1.  Management  \n19.  ECP's  dedicated  fund  management  team  manages  this  fund  and  the  remaining \ndivestments of ShoreCap I, the fund manager\u2019s first fund. The fund management team consists \nof (i) Frank Kennedy (president); (ii) Davis Golding (chief investment officer); (iii) Kenny Nwosu \n(director of Africa  investments); (iv) Teerawut Pangviroonrug (director of Asia  investments, \nbased in Thailand); (v) Nathalie Gabala (director of African investments, based in South Africa); \n(vi) Leslie Davis (director of portfolio management); (vii) Steve Brown (director of finance and \nadministration);  and  (viii)  Lynn  Pikholz  (director  of  capacity-building  investments).  Although \nprimarily based in ECP\u2019s head office in Chicago, the fund manager has deep local knowledge of \nboth  Asia  and  Africa  as  a  result  of  the  ECP  management  team's  extensive  network  and \nexperience in the region.  \n  \n2.  Corporate Governance \n20.  The fund has a board of directors (consisting of five members), and the fund manager \nalso has a board of directors (consisting of seven members).  The fund will have an advisory \nboard of up to six members, comprising representatives of the fund\u2019s investors. ADB will have a \nseat on the advisory board. The advisory board will represent the interests of the investors, and \nadvise  and  provide  guidance  to  the  fund  manager  on  matters  related  to  fund  operations, \ngovernance, valuations of portfolio investments, and conflicts of interest.  \n \n3.  Risk Management \n21.  The fund manager will manage risk through its investment process,  which involves \nseveral  layers  of  approval,  and  through  its  investment  committee,  which  is  comprised  of \nmembers of the fund management team with one independent member.   \n \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n22.  The fund will invest in the equity or quasi-equity of regulated MFIs and SBBs with \nsignificant growth and return potential based on a demonstrated business strategy of expanding \nfinancial services to underserved markets in Africa and Asia. The fund manager will target \nmostly regulated MFIs and SBBs for investments by the fund, and will focus on institutions with \nstrong local roots and leadership. In particular, the fund manager will target high-growth, early-\nstage regulated institutions; underperforming regulated banks capable of transformation; and \nregulated institutions looking at significant geographic expansion opportunities. \n ", "  7 \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n23.  ADB proposes making an equity investment of up to $10 million in the fund, not to \nexceed 25% of the fund\u2019s total capital commitments, whichever is less, and not resulting in ADB \nbeing the single largest investor in the fund. ADB's equity contribution to the fund will be used \nexclusively for investments in DMCs, and the return on such contribution will be based solely on \nthe performance of the fund's investments in Asia. To achieve this segregation, ADB will have \nan excuse right to allow its money not to be drawn for non-DMC investments.  \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n24.  ADB's assistance through equity participation in the fund is justified by the development \nimpact (as described above) that the fund will have in the targeted DMCs, particularly with \nregard to poverty reduction and economic development. This project will add additional value by \n(i)  demonstrating  the  viability  of  a  fund  that  serves  SMEs  and  microenterprises  through \ninvestments in financial intermediaries in DMCs, and (ii) continuing to support a fund manager \nthat has already been successful in microfinance and SME lending in Asia. ADB's investment \nwill allow the fund to reach its target level of capitalization and effectively carry out its planned \noperations. In the absence of ADB support, it would be very difficult for the fund manager to \nachieve the target size for the fund and for the fund to be financially sustainable.  \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n25.  ADB\u2019s investment in the fund is classified as category FI24 under ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009). The fund will finance micro and small enterprises that are not expected \nto  entail  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  or  affect  any  indigenous  peoples.  The  fund \nmanager has already established a social and environmental management system (SEMS) \ncompliant with IFC\u2019s performance standards and has adopted a microfinance exclusion list. As \nrequired under the SEMS, due diligence reports prepared by ECP investment officers for the \ninvestment committee also include specific reporting on a prospective  investee institution's \nbusiness  principles  as  they  relate  to  environmental,  social,  labor,  health,  and  safety \nconsiderations in operations. If needed, the fund\u2019s SEMS will be upgraded to meet ADB\u2019s \nrequirements under the Safeguard Policy Statement. ADB will coordinate with the fund manager \nto ensure that all changes to the SEMS (if required) are made before ADB\u2019s first disbursement \nto the fund. \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n26.  The fund manager was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and policy relating to the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n(2003). Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, \nADB will require the fund to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls \nfollowing international best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism,  and  covenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from \nengaging in such activities. The investment documentation between ADB and the fund will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \n                                                \n24 FI stands for financial intermediary. \n ", "8     \n \n27.  As mentioned in para. 27, the fund is a limited liability company registered in Mauritius\u2014\nan offshore financial center and common location of incorporation for funds and fund managers. \nIncorporation in an offshore financial center allows the fund and its investors to avoid double \ntaxation, as a result of the country\u2019s own tax regulations and the tax treaties that it has with \nother countries. Having undertaken its own due diligence of this matter, the project team is \nsatisfied that the fund will not be used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or the \nfinancing of terrorism. \nC.  Investment Limitations \n28.  The proposed transaction, once approved and signed, will increase ADB's projected \nnonsovereign exposure by the end of June 2011 to $5.7 billion. Additionally, the proposed \ntransaction will increase nonsovereign exposure to the PRC (to $1.31 billion or 22.8% of total \nnonsovereign exposure) and to India (to $1.36 billion or 23.6%). Total nonsovereign exposure to \nprivate  equity  funds  will  also  increase  to  $709.5  million  or  12.35%  of  total  nonsovereign \nexposure. The proposed financing is within ADB\u2019s approved medium-term limit, country limit for \nany country within Asia, and industry and group exposure limits for nonsovereign operations. As \nfor the obligor limit in an equity fund, it complies with the policy limit, although ADB's investment \nreturns are tied only to the portion of the fund to be invested in ADB DMCs.  \nD.  Assurances \n29.  Following approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, ADB will \nenter into suitable documentation, in a form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n30.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to $10,000,000 in ShoreCap II Limited from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, on such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth \nin this report and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n17 November 2010 ", "Appendix 1  9 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nIncreased economic  By the time of the  Fund's quarterly and  Stable or increased \ncontribution to Asia and  fund\u2019s exit, investee  annual reports  economic development \nthe Pacific by MFIs and  MFIs and SBBs    in DMCs \nSBBs  increase net income by     \n  50% and increase     \n  taxes paid by 50% over     \n  levels at the time of     \n  investment     \n       \nGreater reach to  By the time of the  Fund's quarterly and  Continued commitment \nunderserved clients  fund\u2019s exit, the number  annual reports  of MFIs and SBBs to \n(women and rural  of loans made by MFIs    reach underserved \nclients)  and SBBs to women    populations \n  and rural clients     \n  increased by 30%     \n  compared with levels at     \n  the time of investment     \n       \nImproved corporate  International standards  Fund's quarterly and  Continued commitment \ngovernance in MFIs  for financial reporting  annual reports  of fund investee \nand SBBs  and corporate    institutions to adopt \ngovernance established  and maintain \nin fund's MFI and SBB  international standards \ninvestment companies  for financial reporting \nby 2019  and corporate \ngovernance \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nExpanded and  Investors' committed  Fund\u2019s capital account  No adverse macro \nimproved access to  capital is fully drawn  statements to ADB  changes that will have \nfinance for MFIs and  down by 2015    a negative impact on \nSBBs in ADB DMCs.      banking or \n    microfinance \n    development \n     \nFund invests in at least  Fund's quarterly and  Adequate demand \n11 MFIs and SBBs in  annual reports  exists from MFIs and \nADB DMCs by 2015    SBBs for financing \n     \nBy time of fund\u2019s exit,  Fund's quarterly and  The fund manager \ninvestee MFIs and  annual reports  finds attractive \nSBBs increase assets    investment \nby 80% and loan    opportunities  \nportfolios by 80%     \n    The fund manager can \nInvestee institutions are  Fund\u2019s annual  influence investees to \ncompliant with ADB's  environmental and social  comply with \nSafeguard Policy  compliance report to ADB  environmental and \nStatement (2009)  social compliance \nrequirements  \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nOutputs      Assumptions \nEstablishment of the  The fund raises  Quarterly reports on  Prevailing market \nfund and its policies  $75 million by the final  investment status and  conditions are stable \n  closing in 2011  annual financial  and there is continued \n    statements of the fund  interest in SBBs and \n    MFIs in targeted DMCs \nAn environmental and  An ESMS document \n \nsocial management  satisfactory to ADB is \n \nsystem (ESMS) is  approved by the fund and \n \nestablished and  submitted to ADB \nimplemented by 2011  \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \na.
