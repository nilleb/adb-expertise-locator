INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  support  to  the  Government  of \nMongolia (the Government) for urban sector development since 1998. The Mongolia country \noperations business plan 2008\u20132010 includes the Urban Transport Development Project in the \n2009  pipeline.1 A  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  was  included  in  the  ADB \nassistance program for 2008 to help the Government prepare the Project.  In May 2008, ADB \nfielded a fact-finding mission for the TA, which reached agreement with the Government on the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, methodology and key activities, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates, financing plan, and outline terms of reference for consulting services of the TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the last decade, Mongolia has experienced rapid and intensive urbanization. As a \nresult of in-migration from rural areas and provincial centers, the population of Mongolia\u2019s \ncapital city, Ulaanbaatar, has doubled. Today, more than 1 million people reside in Ulaanbaatar, \nwhich  is  facing  serious  urban  development  challenges,  including  insufficient  transport \ninfrastructure and poor quality of public transport services. Investments in urban transport, traffic \nmanagement,  and  road  safety  have  significantly  lagged  behind  the  pace  of  urbanization. \nCoordination among relevant agencies is lacking, and the institutions responsible for regulating \npublic transport service provision are weak.   \n \n3.  Transport infrastructure and services in Ulaanbaatar are suffering from increasing road \ncongestion, insufficient traffic management, poor safety conditions, and a weak public transport \nsystem.3 These  factors  contribute  to  economic  inefficiency  due  to  increased  trip  times, \nexcessive fuel use, and poor air quality, which all serve to reduce residents\u2019 quality of life and \nact as a bottleneck to growth. According to estimates of the city\u2019s traffic police, about 50,000 \nvehicles, most of which are secondhand and of poor quality, are added to the city\u2019s roads \nannually, representing an increase of about 25% per year\u2014one of the highest urban private \nvehicle growth rates in the world. While technical and environmental standards for vehicle safety \nand emissions have been put in place, they are not sufficiently enforced.  \n \n4.  The  public  transport  system  is  struggling  with  technical,  financial,  and  institutional \nchallenges. Bus tariffs have not been increased since 1999, while fuel costs have increased \nmore than 5 times in the same period. The municipal budget subsidizes about 42% of the bus \ncompanies\u2019 annual costs, but the mechanism for allocating subsidies lacks transparency and is \nperceived as inequitable. Bus operators lack financial resources to renew and expand their bus \nfleet and provide adequate transportation services. Interaction among the different modes of \npublic transport is far from optimal. Instead of feeding higher-capacity bus routes, minibuses \ntend to compete with the higher-capacity buses, thereby adding to road congestion. Bus and \nminibus routes are not designed as part of a feeder-and-main-line system, and the system for \nallocating routes needs updating.  \n \n5.  The road network is well developed in the central area of Ulaanbaatar, but in outlying \nresidential areas, where many low income families live, ill-maintained primary feeder roads and \nun-surfaced connector roads are the norm. Budgetary allocations for new roads have increased \nsignificantly with help from the Mongolian Development Fund, and investment levels in roads far \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan (2008\u20132010): Mongolia. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 May 2008. \n3  Public transport refers to systems and infrastructure used to transport members of the general public at set fares. \n ", "2   \noutweigh those in public transport.4 However, the efficacy of this investment is threatened due to \nthe lack of a systematic road maintenance program and budgeting mechanism. While the \nmunicipal government of Ulaanbaatar (MGU) has a road fund that finances construction and \nmaintenance works, allocations for maintenance are ad hoc and insufficient. The following areas \nof MGU\u2019s capacity require considerable improvement: (i) development, implementation, and \nenforcement of the urban transport policy and strategy; (ii) long-term investment planning, \ncapital  budgeting,  and  financial  management;  and  (iii)  design  and  management  of  urban \ntransport projects financed by international development partners.  \n \n6.  Traffic  congestion  is  aggravated  by  insufficient  enforcement  of  parking  control, \ndesignated parking spaces, pedestrians, lack of driver discipline, inadequate signaling, and \ninsufficient traffic control. Traffic accidents are common due to poor traffic management and the \nuncontrolled interaction of pedestrians and vehicles.5 Encroachment on roads and sidewalks by \nparked vehicles worsens the traffic situation. Planning and budgeting for pedestrian and parking \ninfrastructure are lacking. \n \n7.  Given the rapid growth in private vehicles, road improvements will only make limited and \ntemporary improvements. Strong institutions with clear mandates are required to implement \ninvestments, attract financing, coordinate among stakeholders, and regulate service providers. \nMultiple institutions at the central and local levels are involved in urban transport services and \nclarifying their roles and enhancing coordination among them should be prioritized. Without a \nviable system of public transport, Ulaanbaatar will soon experience serious traffic congestion \nwith negative impacts on economic vitality and quality of life. Improvements in traffic and parking \ncontrol, driving behavior, and enforcement are also critical for addressing the city\u2019s transport \nneeds.   \n \n8.  The  urban  poor  suffer  disproportionately  from  an  inadequate  transport  system. \nUnderinvestment in public transportation raises the cost of commuting and restricts access to \njobs and services. The poor tend to be more exposed to risks associated with externalities in \ntransport. For example, they lack adequate means to avoid exposure to polluted air, face higher \ncommuting distances and costs, and are particularly affected when there is a lack of provisions \nfor pedestrians. The poor stand to benefit significantly from improved transportation services.  \n \n9.  Development partner engagement in the urban transport sector has been limited, but \ncould soon increase. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is assisting MGU to update \nthe city master plan and expects to produce a midterm report in December 2008. Several \nproposals related to the transport sector are emerging from this effort, such as flyovers at key \njunctions and an underground rapid transit system. The European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment has offered assistance to one of the municipally-owned bus companies, but this \nproject is currently stalled. The Export\u2013Import Bank of Korea is financing an intelligent transport \nsystem project, at an estimated cost of $17 million, to reduce road congestion with improved \ntraffic signals at 79 intersections that will be integrated and coordinated through a central control \ncenter. One of the goals of ADB\u2019s ongoing Urban Development Sector Project6 is to improve \nroad access of ger7 areas to the central areas of Ulaanbaatar. ADB is coordinating its activities \nwith other international financial institutions and bilateral agencies to strengthen policy dialogue \nwith  the  Government  on  introducing  a  financially-sustainable  and  environmentally-friendly \n                                                 \n4  For 2008, the municipal government of Ulaanbaatar (MGU) earmarked about $20 million from budget resources, \nand under ADB\u2019s Urban Development Sector Project $10 million was allocated for ger area road improvements \n(footnote 6).  \n5 WHO estimates that Mongolia has the 18th worst traffic accident incidence in the world.  \n6  ADB. 2006.

The TA aims to assist MGU in \nformulating an urban transport road map and investment program, and preparing an investment \nproject for potential ADB financing. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA is improved urban transport infrastructure and management in \nUlaanbaatar. The outcome of the TA is a project design for an investment project suitable for \nADB financing. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will (i) analyze the current status of urban transport in Ulaanbaatar and identify \nthe main problems and bottlenecks in the system; (ii) develop a comprehensive road map and \ninvestment program to improve urban transport management, infrastructure, and service quality; \n(iii) develop and prepare an integrated public transport and rapid transit plan and program; and \n(iv) prepare an investment project for potential ADB financing. Specifically, the TA components \nwill (i) identify and achieve agreement with the Government on priority investment needs; (ii) \ndevelop the urban transport road map; (iii) based on the road map, prepare estimated financing \nrequirements  and  develop  an  investment  program;  (iv)  prepare  pre-feasibility  studies  and \nconduct due diligence for a package of physical investments to be supported by an ADB loan \nand other financing sources; (v) develop a package of technical assistance for institutional \ncoordination and strengthening, behavioral change and enforcement, public awareness and \noutreach, and project implementation and monitoring; and (vi) provide transaction advice for a \npublic\u2013private partnership (PPP) in the operation of public transport and rapid transit services. \nThe TA will conduct detailed analysis of PPP options\u2014including management contract, leasing, \nand concession\u2014and advise the most suitable PPP modes for the public transport and rapid \ntransit services.   \n \n12.  The Ulaanbaatar sustainable urban transport road map and investment plan will set out \ngoals for transport services over the next 10\u201315 years and establish a plan of investments \nneeded to achieve these goals. An assessment of current conditions will be undertaken and will \ntake into account the country urban transport findings and recommendations from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency-assisted Study on City Master Plan and Urban Development \nProgram of Ulaanbaatar City, and the projects and programs of other domestic and international \nfinancial institutions. A road map will be developed based on consultations with MGU and other \nstakeholders. It will establish clear goals for urban transport and mobility, with measurable \ntargets that allow the regular monitoring of progress. Together, the road map and investment \nplan will prioritize financially- and environmentally-sustainable modes of transport, and address \nrequisite  institutional  arrangements  and  policies,  including  provision  of  access  to  public \ntransport  services  of  low-income  passengers.  The  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n13.  Preparation of an investment project for public transport and rapid transit development \nwill include a review of the current conditions within the city, identify improvements to public \ntransport that are needed to address these, and prepare a pre-feasibility study for the first rapid \ntransit corridor.8  The review of current conditions will examine public transport routes and \npassenger demand, fare structures, ticketing systems, fleet conditions, subsidies and financial \nviability, and operational service standards. Following consultations with MGU, the Government, \n                                                 \n8  \u201cRapid transit\u201d refers here to high-capacity rail and bus-based technologies. \n ", "4   \nand other stakeholders, proposals will be made for improvements to public transport including \nidentification of priority rapid transit corridors and appropriate technology, rationalization of bus \nroutes  to  increase  efficiency,  regulatory  systems  and  institutional  capacity,  physical \ninfrastructure investments, and institutional arrangements and capacity development.9 The pre-\nfeasibility study of physical and institutional investments required to establish the first corridor of \na rapid transit system will comprise concept design, institutional structure and management, \noperational  plans,  preliminary  financial  and  economic  analysis,  options  for  financing  and \nfinancial structuring, and safeguard analysis (social, resettlement, and environment). The pre-\nfeasibility study will be used as the basis for investments to be financed under a proposed ADB \nloan project for urban transport in Ulaanbaatar. \n \n14.  Developing a traffic management and road safety program under the Project will include \nreview of the current conditions within the central business district and, in consultation with \nMGU, development of an investment program for traffic and mobility improvement. The work will \nbegin with the development of an area traffic model using existing traffic and public transport \ndata, augmented by surveys including a screen-line survey of the inner ring road.10 On this \nbasis,  and  in  consultation  with  MGU,  priority  improvements  in  traffic  management,  public \ntransport services, and pedestrian services will be identified and developed into an investment \nprogram for traffic management and road safety. The program will include a circulation plan for \nvehicle traffic that takes into account motorized vehicles\u2019 interaction with pedestrians and non-\nmotorized  vehicles,  and  considers  one-way  and  pedestrian-only  areas.  It  will  also  cover \ninstitutional arrangements required to coordinate activities and regulate services. This work will \nbe closely coordinated with the ongoing intelligent transport system project being considered by \nMGU and the Government (para.9).11 The investment program will be used as the basis for \ninvestments  to  be  financed  under  a  proposed  ADB  loan  project  for  urban  transport  in \nUlaanbaatar. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $1.4  million.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $1.2 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the balance of \ncosts,  equivalent  to  $200,000,  through  in-kind  contributions  of  office  space,  furniture, \nadministrative support services, logistics, and salaries of counterpart staff. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MGU will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. The Government will form a steering \ncommittee that will be chaired by the mayor of Ulaanbaatar, and will comprise representatives of \nthe Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Road, Transportation and Urban Development; and traffic \npolice. The TA project management unit will be established in, and will report to, the EA.  \n \n17.  The total consultants\u2019 input is estimated at 87 person-months\u201434 international and 53 \nnational. The consultants will be engaged through a firm and as individuals in accordance with \n                                                 \n9  The selection of a suitable technology for rapid transit should be based on the economic rate of return of the \ninvestment, fiscal implications, and consideration of long-term investment plans and policies concerning allocation \nof road space to private vehicles. The economic rate of return of rapid transit investments are known to be \nsensitive to passenger demand and willingness to pay. \n10 Screen lines divide the area into large natural zones (e.g., at both sides of a river or motorway), with few crossing \npoints between them. The data serves to validate and fill in gaps in household surveys. \n11 Total  project  cost  is  $17.0  million,  of  which  $12.8  million  will  be  financed  by  the  Economic  Development \nCooperation Fund of the Republic of Korea, and $4.2 million will be financed by the Government of Mongolia.   \n ", "  5\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultants will have expertise in public transport engineering and management, financial and \neconomic analysis of investment projects, institutional development, social analysis, poverty \nimpact  assessment,  and  environmental  impact  analysis.  The  international  consultants  will \nprovide  expertise  in  transport  planning  and  policy  (7  person-months),  institutional  reform \n(5 person-months),  rapid  transit  planning  (6  person-months),  traffic  engineering  (6  person-\nmonths),  financial  management  and  structuring  (5  person-months),  economic  analysis \n(1 person-month), environmental engineering (2 person-months), and resettlement and social \ndevelopment (2 person-months). The national consultants will provide expertise in transport \nplanning (7 person-months), institutional reform (6 person-months), traffic survey (4 person-\nmonths), traffic engineering (6 person-months), civil engineering and cost analysis (4 person-\nmonths), financial management and financial structuring (6 person-months), economic analysis \n(2  person-months),  environmental  engineering  (2  person-months),  resettlement  and  social \ndevelopment (2 person-months), and engineering drafting (14 person-months). The consultants\u2019 \noutline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. For consultants to be engaged through a firm, ADB \nwill select and engage them on the basis of the quality of the proposal (80%) and the cost (20%) \nof the services to be provided (the standard quality- and cost-based selection method), using \nsimplified  technical  proposal  procedures.  The  consultants  selected as  individuals  will  have \nexpertise in (i) monitoring and evaluation of infrastructure investment projects, and (ii) project \nfinancing and capital budgeting to assess and provide advice on PPP opportunities for public \ntransport and rapid transit services. The Government will provide the TA consultants with a \nsuitably-furnished office with utilities, telecommunication access, materials, maps, data, and all \nrelated documents required by the TA. The TA equipment will be procured by the consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and \ntransferred to MGU upon TA completion.12 \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from January 2009 to the end of June 2009.  \nThe consultants\u2019 team will submit to ADB and EA separate inception, interim, draft final, and \nfinal reports. All the reports will be submitted in the English and Mongolian languages. The \ninception report will be submitted to ADB and EA within 1 month from the TA commencement \ndate. The interim report with detailed assessment of the priority investment, capacity-building \nand institutional-development needs, and policy issues will be submitted to ADB and EA within \n3 months of TA commencement. For the purpose of discussing the interim report and providing \nguidance  to  the  project  design,  a  workshop  with  participation  from  representatives  of  the \nGovernment, MGU, and other stakeholders will be held 3 months after TA commencement. A \ndraft final report with a detailed description of the investment project, including the institutional \ndevelopment  and  capacity-building  program,  and  other  relevant  recommendations  will  be \nsubmitted within 5 months of TA commencement.   \n \n19.  The following tripartite meetings will be held during the TA implementation period: (i) a \nfirst meeting will immediately follow the stakeholder workshop, and (ii) a second meeting will \nfollow submission of the draft final report. The final report incorporating the comments will be \nsubmitted 2 weeks after the second tripartite meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of TA not exceeding the equivalent of $1.2 million on a grant basis to the Government \nof Mongolia for Preparing the Urban Transport Development Project, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                 \n12 The TA equipment will include personal computers and printers, and a copier, scanner, and fax machine.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n  Mechanisms  \nImpact  By 2014:   Annual  Assumption \nImproved urban    socioeconomic  \u2022  Effective traffic \ntransport  Improved health indicators   surveys undertaken  enforcement \ninfrastructure and    as part of the PPMS  \nmanagement in  Improved air quality in the city    Risk \nUlaanbaatar    The municipal  \u2022  Costs are higher than \n  Reduced incidence of traffic  government of  planned \ncongestion, delays, and  Ulaanbaatar and   \naccidents by 30%  police records and \n  statistics \nReduced travel time by 30%   \n  Air quality data of \n  the Ministry of \nHealth \n \nOutcome  Memorandum of understanding  Memorandum of  Assumptions \nProject design,  signed by the Government and  understanding  \u2022  Strong government \nfeasibility study, and  ADB at final tripartite meeting in    commitment to \nrelated project  June 2009  develop a sustainable \nreports completed  transport system \nand agreed upon by   \nthe Government and  \u2022  Acceptance by the \nADB, and suitable  Government of \nfor ADB financing  proposed solutions \n  and plans \n   \n\u2022  Government\u2019s \ncapacity \nstrengthened  \n \nRisk \n\u2022  Lack of effective \ngovernment support \nand coordination \namong agencies  \n \nOutputs  Analysis of the current urban  Inception report and  Assumptions \n1.

Overall Scope of Work \n \n1.  The  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  formulate  a  program  of  urban \ntransport and transportation improvements for Ulaanbaatar and prepare a package of priority \nproject investments suitable for funding by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The main \nelements of the TA, listed below, will be carried out simultaneously.  \n \n2.  Ulaanbaatar Urban Transport Road Map and Investment Program. The road map \nwill identify and set out an investment program and associated policy; and an institutional, \nlegislative, regulatory, and enforcement framework, elements of which will be detailed in paras. \n7-8 of this scope of work for consulting services. Prior to finalization of the road map and the \nassociated investment program, the Government and other stakeholders will be consulted on \nthe output of this phase of the TA through a workshop. \n \n3.  Integrated Public Transport Improvements and Rapid Transit Development. The \nmodern  public  transport  and  rapid  transit  plan  will  be  prepared  based  on  the  investment \nprogram outlined in the road map. The TA will include a review of current conditions within the \ncity, assessment of future urban transportation needs, identification of improvements to public \ntransport needed to address these needs, and preparation of a pre-feasibility study for an initial \nrapid transit corridor.1   \n \n4.  Traffic Management and Road Safety Component. The traffic management and road \nsafety component will review all aspects of mobility within the central business district and, in \naccordance with the sector road map and in consultation with the municipal government of \nUlaanbaatar (MGU), develop an investment program for traffic and mobility improvements. The \nproposals will be based on a traffic model of the central area network under current and future \nconditions that will be developed using existing traffic and public transport data, and augmented \nas necessary by traffic surveys, including a screen-line survey and projected travel demand \ncharacteristics in 2015.  \n \n5.  Institutional and Financial Framework. The TA will assess the current institutional \nframework under which public transport, road infrastructure, and services are planned, provided, \noperated, and maintained, and through which traffic is managed in Ulaanbaatar; identify issues, \nproblems, and constraints; and develop solutions as part of the road map preparation. An \ninstitutional and financial reform program will be developed to support the investment program \nbased  on  (i)  the  policy,  institutional,  legislative,  regulatory,  and  enforcement  framework \ndeveloped as part of the sector road map; and (ii) the operational, institutional, and financial \nstructuring proposals made to support the mass transit and traffic management and road safety \ncomponents. The reform program will identify key roles for the public and private sector in the \nestablishment of viable institutional arrangements necessary to (i) coordinate government inputs \nto system design and transaction advice, (ii) regulate and operate the eventual rapid transit \nsystem, (iii) regulate public buses and bus routes, (iv) enforce traffic management and parking, \nand  (v)  set  up  necessary  mechanisms  and  capacity  for  road  investment  planning  and \nprogramming, and road maintenance actions based on a clearly-defined set of measurable \nindicators and criteria. \n \n                                                 \n1 \u201cRapid transit\u201d refers to high-capacity modes, including technologies based on rail and bus (e.g., bus rapid transit). \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \n6.
