INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Republic of Azerbaijan is transitioning to a diversified, knowledge-based economy \nthat bolsters sustainable non-oil economic growth. The energy sector (power, oil, and gas) plays \na leading role in Azerbaijan\u2019s socioeconomic growth. The Government of Azerbaijan owns and \nmanages the energy sector in Azerbaijan, and is committed to sector reform with the aim of \nimproving system efficiency, supply reliability, and transparency. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) is committed to collaborate with the government in promoting power sector reform, \nefficiency  improvement,  capacity  building,  and  good  governance.  ADB  is  considering  a \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  for  the  Power  Distribution  Enhancement  Investment \nProgram to support energy efficiency improvement.1 As a part of the sector road map under the \nMFF, the government has undertaken to achieve full cost recovery tariff by 2022 through \npursuing  tariff  reform.  The  government  requested  assistance  from  ADB  to  support  the \npreparation  and  implementation  of  a  power  sector  financial  recovery  plan  to  achieve  the \ncommitted targets. \n \n2.  ADB undertook a consultation mission in March 2016, during which the government \nconcurred with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA) \nconcept paper was approved on 2 June 2016.2 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Sector overview. Azerbaijan\u2019s total electricity production in 2014 reached 22.70 billion \nkilowatt-hours  (kWh),  of  which  94%  was  generated  from  thermal  power  and  6%  from \nhydropower.3 The total installed generation capacity by end of 2014 is 6.23 gigawatts, including \ngas-fired thermal power plant capacity of 5.13 gigawatts (82.3%) and hydropower plant capacity \nof 1.10 gigawatts (17.7%). The electricity production is sufficient to cover domestic demand, \nwith  the  surplus  being  exported  to  neighboring  countries,  taking  advantage  of  regional \nsynergies.4 Though Azerbaijan is presently going through an economic downturn, recovery is \nprojected in 2018 and beyond. Domestic electricity sales are expected to grow due to economic \nrecovery and improved reliability of the power supply. \n \n4.  Based on the energy sector assessment (footnote 1), key challenges facing the power \nsector are (i) improving operational and financial efficiency, (ii) restoring and maintaining high \nlevels of services throughout the country, and (iii) establishing a sustainable cost-recovery \nfinancing  mechanism  (footnote  1).  Though  significant  investments  have  been  made  in \ngeneration and transmission facilities since 2005, relatively little investment has been made in \nthe distribution network because of budgetary constraints. The distribution network, particularly \nin rural areas, is the bottleneck of the power supply chain with high losses,5 and requires a $4.6 \nbillion investment during 2013\u20132025.6 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

Update of the Energy Sector Master Plan of Azerbaijan, 2013\u20132025: Final Report. Manila. \n ", "2      \n5.   Reform progress. The power sector reform in Azerbaijan began in 2006 when the \ngovernment took steps to partially unbundle the sector, strengthen the regulatory framework, \nand encourage private sector involvement in power generation. However, private participation in \npower generation and separation of several distribution areas from the vertically integrated \nmonopoly did not deliver the desired results. The overall tariff levels and the limited margins \nprovided to the distribution companies, coupled with low collection rates, were the main barriers. \n \n6.  However,  there  were  positive  outcomes,  and  the  Joint  Stock  Company \nBakielektrikshebeke (i.e. Baku area electricity distribution company) was successful in reducing \nlosses from 18% to 8% and increasing collection rate from 70% to 95% over the last 10 years. \nBased  on  this  success,  the  government  initiated  new  reforms  in  February  2015  involving \nseparation of the distribution subsector entirely from the vertically integrated power monopoly.7 \nThrough  unbundling,  the  government  aims  to  improve  operational  transparency,  and \naccountability for losses and costs. Further unbundling is expected to be accelerated if the \ndistribution company is successful in improving performance. Also, private sector participation in \ngeneration would be made possible through the new sector structure and more robust cash \nflows from the distribution subsector. \n \n7.  Existing tariff. Electricity tariffs (wholesale and retail) are set by Azerbaijan\u2019s Tariff \nCouncil  comprised  of  representatives  from  line  ministries.  Electricity  tariffs  were  recently \nincreased in July 2016 by 16.67%. This is the first adjustment since 2007. All customers receive \na universal tariff of AZN0.07 per kWh (AZN0.059 per kWh exclusive of value-added tax) and \nAzerishiq  Open  Joint-Stock  Company  (OJSC)  pays  Azerenerji  OJSC  a  universal  tariff  of \nAZN0.043  per  kWh  (AZN0.036  per  kWh  exclusive  of  value-added  tax)  for  all  wholesale \npurchases.8 While  the  margin  between  the  end-use  tariff  and  electricity  purchase  price \n(AZN0.023 per kWh) for Azerishiq OJSC is considered sufficient to cover the current level of \noperation costs, further study is needed to determine the tariff level that fully recovers all costs \nincluding necessary capital investments to meet electricity demand and quality of supply. \n \n8.  Compared  with  prevailing  international  practice,  a  universal  electricity  tariff  for  all \nconsumers is unusual. Typically, tariffs are differentiated by categories of customers (e.g., \nresidential,  commercial,  industry,  agriculture,  etc.),  and  composed  of  a  fixed  component \n(charged as either a daily rate or a rate based on customers\u2019 peak demand) and an energy \ncomponent (which is sometimes further decomposed into peak and off-peak prices). From a \nfinancial  point  of  view,  the  implications  of  an  energy-only  tariff  are  that  Azerishiq  OJSC\u2019s \nrevenue and profitability are very sensitive to sales volume which is undesirable since fixed \ncosts (network  operations  and maintenance,  interest  costs,  and  depreciation)  are  not fully \naccounted for.  \n \n9.  Government sector strategy and road map. Power sector reform in Azerbaijan is \nbeing propelled forward by the government, together with a road map and time-bound action \nplan for achieving results. A further impetus for reform has been the external shock to the \neconomy mainly attributed to a substantial decline in oil export revenue caused by the falling oil \nprices since mid-2014. The government is embarking on broad structural reforms that include \n                                                \n7  All power distribution assets and functions were entirely transferred from Azerenerji Open Joint-Stock Company \n(OJSC) to Azerishiq OJSC (formerly Joint Stock Company Bakielektrikshebeke).  \n8  Azerishiq OJSC is the state-owned national distribution company and Azerenerji OJSC is the state-owned national \ngeneration and transmission company. Currently Azerenerji OJSC owns generation and transmission assets and \nfunctions, and there are no separated cost centers. The consolidated tariff for generation and transmission is \nAZN0.041 per kWh. It is expected that real costs for generation, transmission, and distribution will be assessed \nunder the TA. \n ", "         3           \nthe power sector. Key measures include enhancing operating efficiency, providing full coverage \nof the electricity supply, undertaking sector reconstruction and commercialization, implementing \nfull  recovery  of  all  costs  associated  with  electricity  supply,  encouraging  private  sector \ninvestment, and implementing full collection of electricity bills. In March 2016, the government \napproved a \u201cBasic Directions of the Strategic Roadmap on the National Economy and Main \nEconomic  Sectors\u201d9 and  an  action  plan for  2016\u20132020 for  developing  specific road maps, \nincluding on the privatization program, state policy on tariff, and restructuring of the power \nsector. \n \n10.  The government recognizes that  supporting the financial sustainability of the power \nsector and establishment of a full cost recovery mechanism  are critical factors that would \npromote sustainable development of the power sector. The government needs to (i) have a \nclear understanding on the financial performance of power utilities and identify improvement \nmeasures, (ii) obtain the best possible international experience and capacity in tariff setting and \nregulation, (iii) develop a strategic road map in achieving the target of full cost recovery, and (iv) \ndevelop  an  institutionalized  and  transparent  mechanism  of  periodic  tariff  determination. \nSubsidies  will  be  targeted  to  cushion  the  impact  on  poor  and  vulnerable  sections  of  the \npopulation, and may also include some portion toward compensating the power distribution \ncompany  for  the  higher  cost  of  service  to  rural  areas,  which  would  also  fulfill  the  social \nresponsibility of the government to promote equity. \n \n11.  The tariff reform and improvement of financial sustainability provide an opportunity for \nADB to help support the design and implementation of the reforms. The TA aims to develop a \nfinancial recovery plan, and to establish a cost recovery tariff and optimize tariff structure, which \nwill help the government meet the financial needs to run the power sector utilities independently \nand efficiently. Supporting the government\u2019s efforts on tariff reform and financial sustainability is \nin line with the country partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Azerbaijan and ADB\u2019s Energy \nPolicy.10 Through implementation of the proposed TA, ADB would also assist the government to \ndevelop an institutionalized and transparent mechanism of periodic tariff determination to avoid \npoliticization of tariffs. \n \n12.  The  tariff  reform  progress  will  be  closely  linked  with  the  proposed  MFF  for  Power \nDistribution  Enhancement  Investment  Program  (footnote  1).  Adoption  and  phased \nimplementation of full-cost recovery tariffs and implementation of a sector financial recovery \nplan are part of the MFF road map to improve financial sustainability. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact will be improved financial performance and sustainability of the power sector \nof Azerbaijan. The outcome will be the development of a power sector financial recovery plan. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The main objective of the TA is to establish an appropriate electricity tariff mechanism \nalong with supportive policies, rules, and regulations to help the power sector achieves full cost \nrecovery by 2022. The full cost recovery tariff shall be a dynamic mechanism with a clear \n                                                \n9  Order of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, 16 March 2016. \n10 ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Azerbaijan, 2014\u20132018. Manila; ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n ", "4      \nstructure of tariffs for the generation, transmission, and distribution subsectors. Such a full cost \nrecovery  tariff  will  take  into  account  the  (i)  recovery  of  power  production  costs  (including \noperation and maintenance costs, and capital costs); (ii) efficient signaling of future power \nproduction costs; (iii) affordability to low-income households; and (iv) distributional equity of \npower supply services. The tariffs will also be subject to the country\u2019s macroeconomic factors, \nincluding domestic price inflation, currency depreciation, taxes and levies. \n \n15.  The TA is structured with a sequential program of phases. The TA includes two phases. \nPhase 1 covers two outputs: (i) calculating the real cost of electricity supply (power generation, \ntransmission, and distribution); and (ii) designing a new tariff structure for power generation,11 \ntransmission, and distribution, with differentiating tariffs for different customers and different \ngeneration sources (hydro, solar, water, gas) in existence and in development, to replace the \ncurrent single tariff for all customers and thereby allow cross-subsidization between customer \nclasses Phase 2 covers two outputs: (i) developing a financial recovery road map for gradual \nincrease in tariff, to achieve a full cost recovery level by 2022; and (ii) undertaking a public \ninformation campaign on tariff reform, case studies of good practices in other countries, and \ninstitutional  strengthening.  Such  a  road  map  will  take  into  consideration  an  increase  in \noperational efficiency, targeting subsidies from the government to benefit poorer segment of \nconsumers selected using a suitable rationale. In parallel, a detailed review of the existing \npolicy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  will  be  undertaken  and  recommendations  will  be \nprovided to the government for consideration. The TA will refer to international best practice in \ncost recovery tariff design in the power sector, and assess the potential application and benefits \nspecific to Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector.  \n \n16.  It  is  assumed  that  the  government  will  remain  committed  to  sector  reform.  Risks \nassociated with this TA include (i) political influences preventing broad government support for \nthe recommendations, (ii) negative public reaction about tariff reform, (iii) weak institutional \ncapacity  in  inter-ministerial  coordination  and  lack  of  accountability,  and  (iv)  delays  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s review and approval of the consultant\u2019s reports. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n18.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, meeting \nfacilitation, access to country data, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for the TA. A working group, led by \nthe  Ministry  of  Finance  with  representatives  from  various  ministries  and  institutional \nstakeholders (e.g., Ministry of Economic Development and Industry, Ministry of Energy, Tariff \nCouncil, Azerishiq OJSC, Azerenerji OJSC) will also be established after TA approval. \n \n20.  The TA will require the services of a consulting firm that will provide international experts \nwith experience and a track record in tariff regulatory policy and financial assessment for the \npower  sector.  The  consulting  firm  will  also  provide  national  experts  who  will  support  the \n                                                \n11  Includes exploring options for carbon pricing for thermal generation. \n ", "         5           \ninternational  experts.    A  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  through  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection using the 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio, and a simplified technical proposal will be required. \nAll consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  In addition, one individual national expert will be hired for 16 person-months as TA \ncoordinator to support the policy and advisory TA team in gathering local knowledge and data, \nand to coordinate with the different government departments. \n \n22.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  The TA is expected to be implemented over 34 months (September 2016\u2013June 2019). \nThe  progress  of  the  TA  will  be  monitored  through  the  minutes  of  bimonthly  coordination \nmeetings  of the TA  working group. The  consultants  will  prepare  regular monthly  progress \nreports to be used for project monitoring. All working group meeting minutes and consultant \nreports, including regular progress reports, will be provided to all key stakeholders. In addition, a \ncommunication and stakeholder management plan will be prepared by the consultants during \nthe initial stages of the TA to facilitate the participation of stakeholders and dissemination of \nknowledge. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,200,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Azerbaijan for Preparing a Power Sector Financial Recovery Plan, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n ", "6     Appendix 1                                                                                                            \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with: \nImproved financial performance and sustainability of the power sector of Azerbaijan (Azerbaijan 2020: Look \ninto the Future, the Government of Azerbaijan, 2012)a \n   Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nPower sector  a.

Objectives \n1.  The  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  assist  the  government \ndevelop a financial recovery plan, establish a cost recovery tariff, and optimize tariff structure, \nwhich will help government meet the financial needs for independently and efficiently running \nthe power sector utilities. \n \nB.  Scope of Services \n \n2.  A consulting firm will provide a team of international and national consultants to deliver \nthe TA outputs. The consultant team should propose and adopt appropriate methodologies and \napproaches in delivering the expected outputs. \n \n3.  Output 1. Calculate the real cost of electricity supply (power generation, transmission, \nand distribution). The consultant team will perform the following tasks in meeting this output: \n(i)   Identify issues concerning (a) administration and finance; (b) operation of sector \nfacilities;  (c)  engineering,  infrastructure,  and  maintenance;  (d)  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution; and (e) marketing and public relations. \n(ii)  Conduct  a  comprehensive  assessment  and  clearly  outline  the  investment \nrequirements, taking into consideration both public and private sector contribution, \nand assess the real costs in the generation, transmission, and distribution subsectors. \n(iii)  Review the current tariff policies including generation, transmission, and distribution \ncharges. Compare the approach and methodology used to internationally acceptable \nstandards. \n(iv)  Establish and examine relevant data for the current pricing and tariff policies used by \nthe different service providers, and validate their objectives against the government \npolicy and the transparency of the methods used. \n(v)  Prepare profit and loss, cash flow, and balance sheet projections for the period of \n2016\u20132025 that show the ability (or the inability) to meet operating costs, investment \nreplacement, and the supply of future power needs. \n \n4.  Output 2. Design new tariff structure for power generation (including options for carbon \npricing  for  thermal  generation),  transmission,  and  distribution,  with  differentiating  tariffs  for \ndifferent customers and different generation sources. The consultant team will perform the \nfollowing tasks in meeting this output: \n(i)  On  the  basis  of  the  financing  needs  identified  in  Output  1,  complete  a  detailed \nanalysis on the revenue and efficiency requirements to be achieved to meet the future \nneeds  for  reliable  electricity  supply.  Identify  any  regulatory  impediments  that  will \nimpact the use of different tariff arrangements and propose changes required. \n(ii)  Based on a study of different tariff models in use in comparable countries, propose one \nor more tariff models that can be adopted in Azerbaijan for each of the three functions: \ngeneration, transmission, and distribution of electricity. At the very least, the tariff \nshould ensure full cost recovery for all sector participants and a fair return on invested \ncapital.  In  particular,  the  tariffs  fixation  mechanism  should  be  flexible  and  allow \nvariable items of cost such as exchange rate fluctuations, interest rate or fuel, and the \nimpact of inflation on costs to be passed through to customers in a timely manner. The \ntariff should allow for differentiation between different classes of customers to help the \ngovernment target its subsidies to poor and vulnerable people. \n(iii)  Propose a set of options for gradual increase in tariff to the full cost recovery level by \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \n2022, and estimate the budgetary subsidies that will be required until the full cost \nrecovery level is attained.  \n(vi)  Calculate the full cost recovery tariff level using various stepped tariff structure options, \ndescribe  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  each  approach,  and  provide \nrecommendations. \n(vii)  Recommend  cost  recovery  policies  that  promote  sector  viability  and  sustainable \nfinancial conditions. \n(viii)  Review, identify, and propose enabling policy, legal, and regulatory changes required \nfor the power sector to be financially viable without ongoing budget support from the \ngovernment for any investment requirements.  \n \n5.  Output 3. Develop a financial recovery road map for gradual increase in tariff, to achieve \nfull cost recovery by 2022. The consultant team will perform the following tasks in meeting this \noutput: \n(i)  Define a set of prudential financial sustainability benchmarks for the power generation, \ntransmission, and distribution companies, such as a capital gearing ratio, debt service \ncoverage ratio, current ratio, self-financing ratio, accounts receivable in number of \ndays, accounts payable in number of days, etc. \n(ii)  Develop a financial recovery road map on tariff reform, to help the sector entities \nachieve the prudential financial sustainability benchmarks. Propose various options \nsuch as conversion of debt owed to the government into equity, debt forgiveness by \nthe government, reduction in interest rates by the government, restructuring of debt \nrepayment schedules on debt owed to the government, fresh equity injection, write-off \nof bad debts, accumulated losses, etc. The plan should (a) include a timeline for \ngradually achieving key benchmarks; and (b) identify the budgetary subsidy to be \nprovided by the government (for each option chosen) until the sector entities become \nfinancially sustainable (i.e., they no longer require external financial support) due to the \napplication of the cost recovery tariff and the improved financial structure. \n(iii)  Prepare  implementation  schedules  and  action  programs  for  implementing  the \nfinancial  recovery  road  map.  Assess  the  capacity  of  government  implementing \nagency in light of the project management and contract administration responsibilities \nunder the proposed implementation arrangements. \n(iv)  The  financial  recovery  road  map  shall  include  relevant  examples  of  successful \nimplementation,  conditions  required  for  the  successful  implementation,  benefits \nderived, and lessons from both successful and unsuccessful experiences from other \ncountries.  \n \n6.

The  consultant  team  will \nperform the following tasks in meeting this output: \n(i)  Prepare case studies of good practices in tariff reforms in other countries, and conduct \nworkshop to the government and disseminate the recommendations. \n(ii)  Design and organize a training and study tour for 5 to 10 staff of the key stakeholders \nin at least one other country to learn of the approach taken to implement tariff reforms \nand the impact these had on cost and service delivery structures. \n(iii)  Facilitate the executing agency, the Ministry of Finance, and other stakeholders in \nproject administration for effective project implementation. Provide on-the-job training \nfor key staff of the stakeholders. \n(iv)  Develop  simple  and  comprehensible  media  products  (e.g.,  infographics,  social \nadvertisements)  covering  the  critical  questions  of  the  public.  Develop  appropriate \npublic  information dissemination  programs,  including surveys, consultations, public \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \nhearings, and media interviews to enhance the public\u2019s understanding of energy sector \nand tariff reform, and encourage public engagement. \n \nC.
