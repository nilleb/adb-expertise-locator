During the Country Program Mission in April 2005, the Government of Bhutan (the \nGovernment)  requested  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to develop a program for enhancing the financing of small- and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  under  the  proposed  SME/Microenterprise  Development \nProgram: Financing Component.1 The request is consistent with the Government\u2019s efforts to \ndevelop the country\u2019s private sector. The TA was included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram 2006\u20132010 for Bhutan.2  \n \n2.  A fact-finding mission visited Thimphu, Bhutan from 21 March to 1 April 2006 and \nreached  an  understanding  on  the  objective,  scope,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA with the Government. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bhutan\u2019s  formal  private  sector  is  categorized  into  large,  medium,  small,  and \nmicro/cottage enterprises, based on the initial capital investment category.4 Only a handful of \nmedium-sized companies (i.e., 100 employees or more) dominate the formal private sector. \nMost enterprises (i.e., 97% of all Bhutanese businesses) are micro- and small enterprises with \nfewer than 10 employees and invested capital of less than Nu5 million. The recent ADB-funded \nTA  for  SME  development  (footnote  1),  which  assisted  the  Government  in  conducting  a \ncomprehensive sector assessment to foster private sector development, found that the majority \nof microenterprises and SMEs face various constraints in their business operations. Limited \naccess to finance is one of the main constraints that hinder the financing of micro- and small \nenterprise (MSE) development.5\n \n4.  The financial sector in Bhutan is very small and provides limited financial products and \nservices. There are only two commercial banks\u2014Bhutan National Bank (BNB) and Bank of \nBhutan  (BOB),  and  two  nonbank  financial  institutions\u2014Bhutan  Development  Finance \nCorporation (BDFC) and Royal Insurance Corporation of Bhutan (RICB). The two commercial \nbanks dominate the financial sector with a market share of 88% in total assets and 76% in total \nlending. However, BOB lends mainly to government enterprises and BNB mainly to medium and \nlarge enterprises or individuals who meet collateral criteria. RICB and BDFC have a combined \nmarket share of 24% of total lending operations.  \n \n5.  Bhutan  Development  Finance  Corporation.  BDFC  was  established  in  1988  with \nassistance  from  ADB,  and  equity  participation  from  the  Government  and  other  financial \ninstitutions (paragraph 7). BDFC is the only development finance institution in Bhutan, and is \nmandated to provide credit to small- and medium-scale industrial and agricultural activities\u2014\nparticularly in rural areas. As a result, BDFC has (i) the most extensive branch network in the \n                                                 \n1  The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is complementary to ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the \nKingdom of Bhutan for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Development. Manila (TA 4412-BHU). \n2  ADB. 2005. Bhutan: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132010). Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 April 2006. \n4  Large enterprises are classified as business investments of more than Nu10 million; medium between Nu5 and \nNu10 million; small between Nu1 and Nu5 million; and microenterprises less than Nu1 million.  \n5  Other  constraints  that  hindered  business  development  include  (i)  cumbersome  business  start-up  process, \n(ii) limited instruments and capacity to formulate and implement a SME development policy, (iii) lack of capacity of \nbusiness development services providers, and (iv) inadequate infrastructure. \n ", "2   \ncountry except BOB; and (ii) 14,764 active clients in rural areas (17.2% of the total rural \nhouseholds), accounting for over 90% of rural lending in Bhutan (end of 2005). BDFC is the only \nfinancial institution with an active role in both rural and MSE lending. According to the 9th Five-\nYear  Plan  (2002\u20132007),  Bhutan\u2019s  overall  economic  development  activities  are  largely \ndependent on the growth of SMEs and microenterprises, particularly those that are rural-based. \nTherefore,  BDFC  is  expected  to  continue  to  play  an  important  role  in  financing  Bhutan\u2019s \ndevelopment activities and bringing financial services to rural areas. In addition, there is a \nconsistent review on the role of BDFC in recent reports.6 BDFC is not yet able to fully fulfill its \nrole as a development bank. Its weaknesses, which have resulted in limited expansion in the \nrural and MSE lending markets, are detailed below. \n \n6.  Resource Mobilization. As a nonbank financial institution, BDFC was not allowed to \nmobilize savings from the public. However, since 2005, it has been entitled to mobilize rural \nsavings on a pilot basis to encourage rural savings. Nonetheless, the main sources of funds are \nexternal concessional loans and grants from international agencies such as ADB, International \nFund for Agricultural Development, and Kuwait Fund for Arab and Economic Development. \nRecently, BDFC received a loan of Nu500 million with a 10-year tenor from BOB. Despite this, \nBDFC\u2019s loan portfolio growth projections for the next 5 years already exceed the organization\u2019s \ncurrent  funding  resources.  Therefore,  the  recent  TA  for  SME  Development  (footnote  1) \nrecommended a credit line approach to address the lack of medium- to long-term funds\u2014along \nwith preparation and implementation of a new strategy and business plan in which BDFC will be \naccountable  for  its  performance  as  a  development  bank.  Furthermore,  the  TA  for  SME \nDevelopment recommended that the new strategy consider expansion of the pilot rural saving \nscheme to ensure its sustainability and integrate the rural economy into the formal financial \nsystem.  The  proposed  interventions  are  in line  with  recommendations  discussed  in earlier \nreports (footnote 6).  \n \n7.  Ownership and Management. BDFC\u2019s initial capital structure consists of Nu100 million \npaid-up  equity  shares,  of  which  the  Government  holds  87%,  BOB  7.5%,  RICB  3%  and \nBNB 2.5%. BDFC is governed by a board of directors and chaired by the secretary of finance. \nThe  board  comprises  representatives  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Trade  and \nIndustry, Ministry of Agriculture, Planning Commission, and a representative from a dzongkhag \n(i.e., district) and a gewog (i.e., block made of several villages). From the standpoint of good \ngovernance, the present structure could benefit from private sector representation. Management \nconsists of (i) the managing director, who is appointed by the Government; and (ii) four general \nmanagers, who are responsible for finance, credit operations, branch operations, and central \nsupport. In 2003, BDFC revised its strategy with ADB assistance7 and developed the 9th five-\nyear business plan (2003\u20132007). However, the business plan has not been fully implemented or \nrevised during the last 3 years to consider new developments, so it is outdated. \n \n8.  Human  Resources.  BDFC  has  high  staff  turnover  because  of  its  limited  benefit \nstructure and inadequate human resources (HR) planning and management. An appropriate \nbenefit and incentive structure should be provided to retain qualified personnel and ensure good \nstaff performance. A human resources development (HRD) division was established in 2003 to \nobtain and secure sufficient staff through adequate HR management. However, the division has \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Bhutan. Manila; ADB. 2001.

Manila (TA 3910-BHU). \n ", "  3\nlimited authority and primarily provides administrative support while the management committee \ntakes all HR and training decisions. \n \n9.  Operational Policies and Procedures. There is no formal policy for offering differential \ninterest rates based on the client\u2019s credit rating, term, or type of lending. BDFC provides term \nloans with different maximum maturities depending on the sector (e.g., manufacturing for up to \n10 years, handicraft/cottage up to 5 years), at an average term of 3.16 years and an average \nsize of about Nu100,000. Branch offices have loan approval authority up to Nu50,000 and \nregional  offices  may  approve  up  to  Nu100,000;  headquarters  approves  all  loans  above \nNu100,000. Loans are primarily approved on the basis of collateral. Loan officers who are \nresponsible for loan processing lack the relevant skills needed for better management of MSEs \nand evaluation of MSE risks. As a result, BDFC\u2019s provision for nonperforming assets are higher \nthan those of other banks, and its portfolio quality has been affected by (i) weak loan appraisal \nand monitoring systems, (ii) weak credit risk management, and (iii) inadequate internal control \nand audit. The portfolio quality will not improve significantly unless a significant change is \nintroduced in these areas.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  overall  TA  objective  is  to  (i)  improve  access  to  finance,  (ii)  generate  income \nopportunities, and (iii) create jobs for the microenterprise and SME sector\u2014through BDFC\u2019s \nimproved performance and greater outreach to MSEs. The TA will support BDFC in enhancing \nits governance, increasing operational efficiency, and raising institutional capacity with a view to \nensuring its sound and stable operation. The TA outcome is an agreed design under the \nproposed  SME/Microenterprises  Development  Program 8   focusing  on  improving  BDFC\u2019s \noperations and business development.  \n \n11.  TA  outputs  include  (i)  an  improved  governance  structure;  (ii)  the  design  of  a  new \nstrategy and business plan (2007\u20132011) for BDFC to ensure that it represents a credible basis \nfor establishing and guiding BDFC\u2019s MSE lending operations; and (iii) capacity building support \nto enable BDFC to implement its business plan, focusing on human resources development, \nMSE  lending  techniques,  development  of  demand-oriented  products,  and  other  areas  as \nrelevant.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will include the following key activities. \n \n13.  Activity 1: Improve Corporate Governance Structure and Operational Policies and \nProcedures.  The  TA  will  (i)  ensure  the  introduction  of  private  sector  representation  and \nimplementation  of  corporate  governance  as  described  in  the  Royal  Monetary  Authority \nPrudential Regulations (2002), and (ii) develop appropriate internal control systems at all levels \nand business areas. The TA will further develop and/or improve policies and procedures, such \nas general risk management, credit risk management, funding and asset liability management, \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004. The draft final report of TA 4412-BHU for SME Development (i) identified the need for a credit line for \nmicroenterprise and SME lending, and further recommended that such an intervention should focus on BDFC; and \n(ii) identified other assistance to further support business development services, formalize the SME development \nstrategy, and strengthen the legal and regulatory framework.   \n ", "4   \nfinancial policies including budgeting and internal control, and overall management information \nsystem procedures. \n \n14.  Activity 2: Develop a New Strategy and Business Plan. The TA will develop a new \nstrategy  and  5-year  business  plan  (2007\u20132011)  for  BDFC,  setting  out  strategic  objectives \nincluding clear financial and operational performance targets, increased coverage and outreach \nfor MSEs, and an outline of how these should be achieved in a cost-effective way. Additional \nattention will be brought to the possible expansion of the rural saving scheme to address the \nexternal  funding  issue.  The  business  plan  should  also  include  (i) analysis  of  the  external \nbusiness environment and BDFC\u2019s internal capabilities, and (ii) a description of BDFC\u2019s key \nproduct and services, competition, and potential comparative advantages, using a strengths, \nopportunities, weakness, and threats (SWOT) analysis. The quality and content of the business \nplan should make it the key reference for justifying and recommending appropriate measures to \nthe board of directors for better performance of BDFC as a development bank. \n \n15.  Activity 3: Provide Capacity Building to Ensure Implementation of Business Plan. \nThe TA will provide training to ensure that BDFC has the capability to follow its mandate as \nspecified in its business plan. Capacity building training will be carried out in areas of HR \ndevelopment, MSE lending policies and techniques, product development, and other areas as \nrelevant. The TA will ensure the implementation of the outputs developed and improved under \nactivities 1 and 2. \n \n(i)  HR development. The TA will upgrade BDFC\u2019s current HR infrastructure and \npractices and deliver a revised HR function including policies, procedures, and \nsystems. Activities will include: (a) development and/or revision of current HR \nmanagement  practices  (e.g.,  staff  recruitment,  HR  planning,  career  path \nmanagement, rewards, and incentives); (b) development of cost-effective and \nsystematic  training  programs  for  all  staff;  and  (c)  a  detailed  HR  functional \ndescription,  including  objectives,  mission,  relationships  within  the  overall \norganization,  key  performance  indicators,  and  policies  governing  the  HR \nactivities in general and each function in particular. \n \n(ii)  Product development. The TA will support the (a) development of demand-\noriented financial products for MSEs, (b) product pricing, and (c) development \nand implementation of marketing activities. \n \n(iii)  MSE lending techniques. MSE lending policies, procedures, and operational \nguidelines will be developed and implemented, including the introduction of cash \nflow based MSE lending techniques, and overall control and monitoring systems. \nTraining materials will be developed and training of trainers will be conducted \nduring  the  TA  implementation  period.  These  activities  will  enhance  BDFC\u2019s \ncapability and enable it to tap into the new potential MSE market. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $590,000, of which $500,000 \nwill  be  financed  by  ADB  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan, and the Government will contribute the remaining $90,000 equivalent in \nkind as office space and facilities, counterpart staff, and administrative and clerical support. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.   The Department of Aid and Debt Management (DADM) at Ministry of Finance will be the \nExecuting  Agency.  BDFC  will  be  the  Implementing  Agency.  A  project  steering  committee \nconsisting  of  representatives  from  DADM,  Ministry  of  Trade  and  Industry,  Royal  Monetary \nAuthority, and BDFC will be established and meet on a quarterly basis to facilitate project \ncoordination.  The  project  preparatory  TA  will  be  implemented  during  an  18-month  period \nstarting in October 2006 and ending in March 2008. Counterpart staff will be nominated from \nDADM and BDFC, and will work closely with TA consultants to ensure timely and effective TA \nimplementation. \n18.  ADB will engage three international consultants for a total of 15 person-months and one \nnational consultant for a total of 12 person-months to provide the required consulting services. \nConsulting services will be delivered intermittently over 18 months. An international consulting \nfirm will be engaged by ADB, using simplified technical proposals under the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nidentified  consultants will  have  experience  working  in  the  above-mentioned  areas  in  small \neconomies, with exposure in the South Asia region. The international consultant team will \ncomprise  a  development  banking/MSE  specialist/team  leader  (8  person-months),  HR \ndevelopment expert (2 person-months), and MSE lending specialist (5 person-months). The \nnational consultant will be a MSE lending/training specialist (12 person-months). The consultant \nteam will be responsible for organizing workshops and providing training to counterpart staff as \nrequired. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n19.  The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report within 21 days of their fielding; (ii) a \nnew strategy and business plan (2007\u20132011) for BDFC 3 months after fielding (i.e., by January \n2007); (iii) a first progress report 6 months after fielding; (iv) a second progress report 12 \nmonths after fielding; (v) a draft final report to be submitted 3 weeks before the end of the \nconsulting term; and (vi) a final report at the end of the consulting assignment.  \n \n20.  At least two tripartite meetings will be held to discuss the strategy and business plan \n(2007\u20132011) for BDFC and other relevant project reports. All reports will be submitted (in hard \nand  soft  copies)  to  the  Government  and  ADB  for  review  and  comments.  Consultants  will \nincorporate the comments received while finalizing the reports. The reports shall be made \navailable 2 weeks from the date of the tripartite meetings and/or receipt of comments. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bhutan  for  preparing  the  SME/Microenterprise  Development  Program: \nFinancing Component, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \n  Mechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved access to  Increased share of  Royal Monetary  \u2022  Program is \nfinance, better income- MSE lending via  Authority annual reports implemented \ngenerating  Bhutan Development     \nopportunities, and  Finance Corporation  BDFC annual reports  \u2022  The Government and \ngreater job creation for  (BDFC)     ADB sign the loan \nmicro- and small    Asian Development  agreement on the \nenterprises (MSEs)  Improved operations  Bank (ADB) review  Small- and Medium-\n  and capacity of BDFC  mission  Sized Enterprise \nto reach out to rural    (SME)/Microenterprise \nareas  ADB reports and  Program  \n  documents   \nBetter and more  Risk \ndemand-oriented  \u2022  Lack of specific \nproducts suitable for  mechanism for \nMSEs  monitoring program \neffectiveness \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nThe agreed design for  Level of disbursement   Memorandum of  \u2022  Full cooperation and \nthe financing  of credit facility to target  understanding signed  participation by the \ncomponent of the SME/  MSEs  by the Government  Government, BDFC, \nMicroenterprise  during appraisal  and other relevant \nDevelopment Program,  mission for sector  stakeholders during \nfocusing on enhancing  development program  project preparatory \nBDFC\u2019s capability in  loan in March 2007  stage \nMSE lending   \n  \u2022  The Government \nagrees on program \ndesign \n \nRisks \n\u2022  Low commitment by \nthe Government and \nrelevant \nstakeholders, \nincluding BDFC, to \nreform \n \n\u2022  Insufficient financial \nresources for policy \nimplementation \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

However, the SME/private sector has not yet become the engine of economic \ngrowth  or  poverty  reduction  in  Bhutan  because  of  (i)  small-sized  domestic  markets,  (ii)  lack  of  labor, \n(iii) underdeveloped infrastructure, and (iv) lack of adequate access to finance. The Government recognized the \nurgent need to further promote private sector development and increase SME business opportunities.  \n \nIt is estimated that 70,000 new graduates will enter the labor market each year. While public sector employment \nopportunities are limited, the private sector\u2014particularly SMEs\u2014is expected to play a greater role in absorbing the \ngrowing youth and educated population in Bhutan. The program will support the Government\u2019s strategy in promoting \nprivate sector/SME development through increasing financial access, providing business development services, and \nenhancing SME policy formulation and relevant legal and regulation framework. It is expected that market-based \nfinance and better business support services will be provided to the private sector, resulting in an increase of private \nsector credits as a percentage of total financial assets to more than the current 20% level; and a growth in private \nsector contribution (in the manufacturing, trade and commerce, and services sectors) as a percentage of gross \ndomestic product from the current 34% level. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThere is an increasing number of new entrants to the labor market but the expansion of the industrial sector is \ncurrently insufficient to absorb the labor force. As such, the importance of developing the private sector, particularly \nmicroenterprises and SMEs, is increasing in terms of job creation and further economic growth by transforming \nBhutan\u2019s economy from a subsistence-based to a more modern and productive one. Most microenterprises and SMEs \nare located in rural areas. The social and poverty impact of developing the private sector will be analyzed while \nrecommending the policy and reform program for SME/microenterprise development.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nFull consultation will be held among relevant stakeholders, including the Bhutan Development Finance Corporation \n(BDFC), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Trade and Industry, Royal Monetary Authority, and other relevant \nmultilateral and bilateral organizations. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nDuring implementation of the technical assistance (TA), there will be two or more workshops and training sessions. \nThe workshops and training will ensure active participation and full communication of key players in further developing \nthe private sector. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " 10  Appendix 2 \nD.
