Nepal\u2019s  10th  five-year  plan  (2002\u20132007),  which  is  also  the  Government\u2019s  poverty \nreduction strategy paper, ends in July 2007. Given the political transition, which is expected to \nlast 2\u20133 years, and the urgency of delivering development results in terms of peace dividends, \nthe  Government  of  Nepal  (the  Government)  has  decided  to  prepare  a  3-year  interim \ndevelopment plan instead of a regular 5-year development plan, following the conclusion of the \n10th plan. In this context, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  preparation  of  the  proposed  3-year  interim \ndevelopment  plan  during  the  2006  Country  Programming  Mission.  The  vice  president \n(Operations 1) approved the TA concept paper on 31 October 2006.1 ADB fielded the TA Fact-\nFinding Mission2 during 8\u201317 November 2006. The Mission\u2019s main objectives were to identify \nthe Government\u2019s needs and priorities and to consult with relevant government agencies and \nother  stakeholders  on  the  scope  and  design  of  the  proposed  TA.  The  Mission  reached \nunderstanding with the Government on the TA\u2019s objective, scope, costs and financing, tentative \nimplementation arrangements, and counterpart support.3 Appendix 1 presents the design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A decade-long conflict has affected Nepal\u2019s social, economic, and political landscape. \nPhysical infrastructure has been destroyed, thousands of people have been internally displaced, \nand development activities have been adversely affected. The average growth rate of Nepal\u2019s \ngross domestic product declined from about 5% during the 1990s to less than 2.6% after 2001. \nFollowing dramatic political developments in April 2006, the Government and the Communist \nParty of Nepal, Maoists (CPN/M) initiated a peace process that led to the signing of a peace \nagreement between the two parties on 21 November 2006 and paved the way for lasting peace \nand stability. These achievements hold promise for ending the insurgency and establishing a \nnew political order conducive to peace and prosperity. However, the transitional period presents \nsignificant challenges, including establishing a democratically elected government and reviving \nNepal\u2019s development activities.  \n \n3.  While the ongoing peace process is a key priority, maintaining a focus on development \nis necessary to address the root causes of conflict, such as poverty and social exclusion. Peace \nis vital, but a lasting peace will need to be supported by accelerated economic growth that \neffectively  reaches  all  areas  and  sections  of  the  population  and  ensures  that  people\u2019s \nsocioeconomic aspirations are adequately met. In view of the conclusion of the 10th plan, \nNepal\u2019s investment and development priorities need to be reviewed and planning is needed for \npost-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation in the changed political and development context. \n \n4.  The current Government is in a transitional phase and is focusing primarily on the peace \nprocess. Understanding that the political transition will require time, the Government is initiating \npreparation of a 3-year interim development plan that recognizes the need for formulating a \ndevelopment framework to guide Nepal\u2019s development activities during the interim period. The \n3-year interim development plan will focus on rapid delivery of public services. While the interim \nplan will reflect and continue the strategic reforms and development priorities of the 10th plan \n                                                 \n1 The TA was included in the 2006 country operations business plan to supplement an ongoing TA (ADB. 2003.  \nTechnical Assistance to the Government of Nepal for Establishing Economic Policy Network. Manila). \n2 The Mission comprised Paolo Spantigati (mission leader), senior country programs specialist and Md. Shahid \nParwez, programs/project implementation officer, Nepal Resident Mission.  \n3 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 November 2006. \n ", "2   \nand will be aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), it will be action \noriented and its scope will be broadened to reflect Nepal\u2019s development needs and challenges \nin the changed political context.  \n \n5.  A centralized approach compounded by a lack of adequate prioritization undermines \nNepal\u2019s approach to planning. The country needs to plan its public resources use carefully to \nfocus on poverty reduction and address the root causes of conflict. The interim development \nplan requires innovative approaches and a results-oriented priority investment program to cater \nto the needs of the poor and the disadvantaged. Another area of concern in relation to achieving \ndevelopment effectiveness is weak implementation and monitoring of past development plans.  \n \n6.  The Government faces a number of challenges in the current political and security \nenvironment.  Key  challenges  in  relation  to  preparing  the  3-year  interim  development  plan \ninclude (i) the need to adopt a participatory planning process, (ii) the need to accommodate \nlocal priorities and capacities, and (iii) the need to accommodate and ensure consistency with \nother policies and public priorities. The interim development plan will need to be results based \nwith clearly identified outcomes, outputs, and interventions that would help achieve them. It \nshould  also  be  linked  to  the  Government\u2019s  short,  medium,  and  long-term  development \nstrategies aimed at meeting the MDGs. To this end, the 3-year interim development plan will \nserve as a building block of Nepal\u2019s long-term development vision. \n \n7.  Priority setting is a crucial aspect of effective planning that requires detailed information, \nsound analysis, and good judgment, along with social consensus and ownership. The National \nPlanning Commission (NPC) needs support with regard to the technical aspects of the plan \npreparation  and  the  participatory  processes needed  to  secure  stakeholder  consensus.  For \npreparing the 3-year interim development plan, the Government will build on work already \nundertaken,  and  in  particular  on  ADB-assisted  TAs  such as  economic  policy  network,  the \nregional development strategy, and the operationalization of managing for development results.4 \nThe plan will support institutionalizing poverty-focused participatory approaches and informed \npolicy-making  processes  in  the  Government.  A  results-based  monitoring  and  evaluation \nmechanism will also be required to track the progress of implementation and provide necessary \nfeedback. \n \n8.  The  Government  has  committed  through  the  FY2007  budget  to  hold  the  Nepal \nDevelopment Forum (NDF) in the third quarter of FY2007. The Government has also indicated \nthat it will prepare a longer-term vision with a more defined, 15 \u2013 20 years strategy and set \ngoals and targets in relation to the country\u2019s socioeconomic development. However, these \nexercises  must  build  on  each  other  and  share  experiences  to  achieve  uniformity  and \ncohesiveness among various policy issues and documents. The timing presents opportunities \nfor the interim development plan, the NDF, and the preparatory work for the long-term vision to \nsupplement and complement each other, which is required in order to better allocate resources, \nenhance  the  implementation  progress,  and  facilitate  program  monitoring  and  evaluation. \nFormulation of a prioritized public investment plan requires preparing a public expenditure \nframework,  improving  service  delivery,  and aid  harmonization.  The NDF  could serve  as  a \nplatform for sharing the major findings of the proposed TA with all development partners in \nrelation to the prioritized public investment plan. The 3-year interim development plan supported \n                                                 \n4 TA4288-NEP: Establishing Economic Policy Network approved in 2003; TA4752-NEP: Regional Development \nStrategy approved in 2005; and TA4765-NEP: Operationalization of Managing for Development Results approved \nin 2006.  \n ", "  3\nby the TA will be a key element to be presented and discussed during NDF. The TA support will \nalso lay the groundwork for the Government\u2019s long-term vision. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will help revive development activities based on the priorities agreed upon in the \npeace accord signed on 21 November 2006 and will address the structural causes of conflict \nand poverty. The outcome of the TA will consist of (i) support for the preparation of a 3-year \ninterim development plan, (ii) facilitation of the NDF, and (iii) initial surveys and strategies \nneeded for preparation of the country\u2019s long-term vision. The TA is fully consistent with the \noperational priorities of the 2004 country strategy and program and the 2006 country operations \nbusiness plan 2006,5 which underline the provision of support to the Government to strengthen \nits capacity to formulate national development plans. The TA will ensure that the 3-year interim \ndevelopment plan follows managing for development results approaches, which are a key \nelement of ADB operations in and support for Nepal. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The 3-year interim development plan will be based on a review and assessment of \nvarious strategic documents prepared by the Government, development partners, and other \nstakeholders. These documents will include the poverty reduction strategy paper, the agriculture \nperspective plan, MDG progress reports, the MDG needs assessment, the water resources \nstrategy, national water plan 2005, roads sector master plan, tourism master plan, health sector \nstrategy,  the  decentralization  implementation  plan,  local  infrastructure  policy,  national  rural \nwater supply and sanitation sector strategy, Nepal living standard survey, and other published \nand unpublished reports.  \n \n11.  Based on the current economic environment and future prospects, a wide range of \nthemes have been identified for the 3-year interim development plan that are directly relevant to \npoverty  reduction,  higher  economic  growth,  and  rehabilitation  and  reconstruction  activities. \nGiven the support other development partners are to provide based on their specific expertise, \nthe  areas  of  support  under  this  TA  include  (i)  employment,  labor,  and  human  resource \ndevelopment; (ii) rural infrastructure development; (iii) private sector development; (iv) social \ninclusion; (v) governance and decentralization; (vi) reconstruction and rehabilitation (short-term \nissue); (vii) agriculture; (viii) participatory management; and (ix) management for development \nresults. The selected areas are consistent with ADB operations in Nepal. Given the evolving \nsituation,  other  themes  and  issues  may  be  identified  for  inclusion  under  the  TA  during \npreparation of the 3-year interim development plan. \n \n12.  The interim development plan will incorporate the essential components of results-based \ndevelopment  planning  with  defined  targets  and  indicators  to  ensure  the  achievement  of \ndevelopment  objectives.  It  will  guide  effective  implementation  of  the  development  agenda, \naddressing the underlying causes of the conflict, gaining the support and confidence of all \nstakeholders, and pursuing approaches for building a lasting peace. A results-based framework \nfor the interim development plan will be prepared to guide program development, resource \nallocation, implementation, and monitoring of progress and to provide feedback for decision \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2004.

A detailed monitoring and evaluation action plan will also be prepared for results-based \nmonitoring and evaluation. \n \n13.  The objectives of the TA will be realized through active participation by senior policy \nmakers, entrepreneurs, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), individual experts, and other key \nstakeholders. The formulation of the development framework and the preparation of documents \nwill adopt a participatory and bottom-up approach. Consultations will be undertaken both at the \nnational and regional levels with local communities and grassroots organizations to identify local \nneeds, strengthen ownership of the outputs. The participatory approach will help ensure the \nsuccessful implementation of the 3-year interim development plan. Special consideration will be \ngiven to participation by disadvantaged communities and related organizations. NPC members \nand line ministry secretaries will play a key role in guiding the preparation of technical papers. A \nnational seminar will be held with various stakeholders to help operationalize implementation of \nthe  recommendations.  Similar  participatory  approaches  will  be  adopted  for  laying  the \ngroundwork for the vision document under the guidance of the Government agency responsible \nfor preparing it.  \n \n14.  The  TA  activities  include  (i)  providing  support  to  the  structures  established  by  the \nGovernment for preparing the 3-year interim development plan, namely, the Steering Committee \n(chaired by the vice chair of the NPC and consisting of representatives of various Government \nagencies) and the NPC\u2019s focal unit; (ii) holding consultative meetings, seminars, and workshops \nto strengthen the participatory approach and ownership of the process for formulating the \ndevelopment strategy; and (iii) facilitating the NDF and supporting the groundwork for preparing \nthe vision document. The NPC\u2019s focal unit will monitor and supervise the work of the TA \nconsultants. The Steering Committee will meet periodically to develop the agenda for document \npreparation and to evaluate progress. The TA activities will encompass the preparation of \ntechnical papers that will be discussed at technical workshops.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $355,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $300,000 on a grant \nbasis. ADB will finance the recruitment of the TA consultants and a major part of the costs of the \nstudies, workshops, and seminars, as well as the costs incurred by the NPC\u2019s focal unit. The \nGovernment will provide office accommodation, counterpart staff, facilities for seminars and \nmeetings, and administrative expenses. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The NPC will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for providing the strategic \ndirection, developing appropriate modalities for overall implementation of the TA, and identifying \nappropriate  activities.  The  Steering  Committee  will  provide  leadership  and  guidance  for \npreparation  of  the  3-year  interim  development  plan  and  related  documents.  The  Steering \nCommittee will meet as necessary, but at least (i) before finalization of the inception report, (ii) \nfor preparation of an outline of the 3-year interim development plan for the NDF, and (iii) for \nfinalization of the TA report. The subcommittees established by the Steering Committee will \nclosely work with the TA consultants on relevant themes. Working committees on cross-cutting \nthemes, which have been established at the NPC with the active participation of pertinent \nstakeholders (including the private sector and NGOs), will be the interlocutors of TA consultants. \nThe NPC focal unit will facilitate, guide, and monitor day-to-day TA activities. The Ministry of \n ", "  5\nFinance, the Government agency responsible for leading preparation of the NDF, will provide \nguidance to the NPC\u2019s focal unit in relation to support for facilitating the NDF and the ministry \nwill have flexible use of funds intended for preparation of the NDF.  \n \n17.  A national consulting firm will be recruited to undertake the TA activities. Only national \nconsultants will be recruited because of the need for an in-depth understanding of the very \nunique local situation, and since participatory planning expertise is available in the country. The \nuse  of  national  consultants  will  help  facilitate  ownership  by  an  honest  interaction  among \nstakeholders. Given the urgent need for TA support and considering that an outline of the draft \n3-year interim development plan is to be prepared by February 2007, the single source selection \nmethod will be used to recruit the consultants. New Era, a national firm, has been identified for \nrecruitment to provide the consulting services. The firm possesses the necessary expertise in \nrequired areas and has provided satisfactorily consulting services to ADB in the past. The \nidentified consulting firm will be recruited in line with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nADB and its Borrowers (2006, as amended from time to time). The sectoral and thematic \nstudies, as well as the interim development plan, will be prepared by soliciting inputs through \nactive  participation  by  all  stakeholders:  civil  society,  political  parties,  NGOs,  and  other \ndevelopment partners at the local, regional and national levels. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months from January to August 2007. A \ntotal of 48 person-months of national consulting services will be required. Appendix 3 presents \nthe terms of reference for the consultants. The TA will provide limited computer equipment and \nmotorcycles, which will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, \nas amended from time to time) and will be handed over to the agencies concerned upon \ncompletion of the TA. Tripartite meetings between the Government, the consultants, and ADB \nwill  be  chaired  by  the  NPC  and  held  regularly  to  review  TA  activities.  By  July  2007,  the \nconsultants will prepare a draft final report that will include (i) TA\u2019s contribution to the 3-year \ninterim development plan, (ii) a description of the use of TA funds, including the NDF, facilitation \nof the vision document and related outputs, (iii) recommendations for the use of remaining TA \nfunds. \n \n19.  The team leader will coordinate TA activities; submit consolidated progress reports to \nthe Steering Committee and the focal unit; and coordinate support to NPC\u2019s focal unit and \ndisburse funds in accordance with ADB regulations. The NPC\u2019s focal unit will keep the Steering \nCommittee informed about TA progress \u2013 and facilitate Steering Committee meetings. The team \nleader  will  prepare  an  inception  report  within  1  month  of  consultant  mobilization  and \nconsolidated  quarterly  progress  reports  on  TA  activities.  An  outline  of  the  3-year  interim \ndevelopment plan will be prepared for the NDF. The TA will also include required outputs for the \nvision document. A draft final report will be prepared no later than 1 month before completion of \nthe TA and the final TA report will incorporate comments on the draft final report and will be \ncompleted by the end of the TA. Three copies of all reports will be submitted to the focal unit, to \nthe Steering Committee, and to ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
