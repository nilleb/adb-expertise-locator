A summary of the environmental impact assessment was \nAssessment  circulated to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Board along with the \nenvironmental management plan on 2 August 2006, and uploaded onto \nthe ADB website on 3 August 2006. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is a key urban infrastructure initiative of the Nanjing municipal \ngovernment (NMG). It is classified as a targeted intervention because it \ncontributes to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7, target 10, which \ncalls for halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to safe \ndrinking water and improved sanitation. The Project will help Nanjing, the \ncapital  city  of  Jiangsu  Province,  in  (i)  reducing  water  pollution;  (ii) \nprotecting water resources; (iii) reducing economic losses and disruption \nto livelihoods from frequent localized flooding; (iv) promoting sustainable \neconomic development; (v) improving the environment, living conditions, \nand public health standards; (vi) developing an integrated wastewater and \nsludge management system; and (vii) improving service efficiency through \nincreased competition and private sector participation.  \n \nThe Project includes 10 major activities grouped into six components: (i) \nInner  Qinhuai  River  sewerage  and  water  replenishment, (ii)  City  East \nwastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and sewerage system, (iii) North He \nXi District sewerage, river improvement, and water replenishment, (iv) \nstormwater drainage, (v) sludge treatment and disposal component, and \n(vi) institutional development. All components of the Project contribute to \nsignificantly improving water quality of the Qinhuai River, which empties \ninto the Yangtze River. The Project supports the Government\u2019s 11th Five-\nYear Plan, which includes goals of improving living conditions and health \nin cities and promoting their sustainable economic development. \n \nThe  Project  represents  a  comprehensive  approach  including  close \ncooperation with ADB\u2019s private sector operations to support NMG\u2019s 11th \nFive-Year  Plan,  which  includes  expansion  of  the  city\u2019s  water  and \nwastewater treatment capacity. NMG is planning to issue a water bond, \none of the first in the PRC. In support, ADB is implementing a technical \nassistance (TA) for Nanjing Water Utility Long-Term Capital Finance in \nCommercial  Markets.  It  is  also  processing  the  Nanjing  Water  Utility \nDevelopment Project, which will provide a partial credit guarantee for up \nto 50% of a bond issue by Nanjing Public Utilities Company, a subsidiary \nof Nanjing Construction Investment Company Limited (NCIC). NCIC is the ", "vi   \nImplementing Agency (IA) for the wastewater treatment component under \nthe proposed Project. Significant synergies have been derived from the \npublic-private approach to improving Nanjing\u2019s urban environment. Policy \ndialogue and promotion of wastewater tariff reforms, rigorous assessment \nof safeguard issues, and capacity-building measures to be undertaken \nthrough  the  proposed  Project  will  support  the  Nanjing  Water  Utility \nDevelopment  Project.  The  two  projects  are  autonomous  and  not \ninterdependent.  The  public-private  sector  approach  to  the  wastewater \ntreatment sector could be replicated elsewhere in the PRC, and in other \ndeveloping member countries.  \n   \nRationale  Nanjing  comprises  11  districts  and  two  counties  and  is  strategically \nlocated at the confluence of the Qinhuai and Changjiang rivers or Yangtze \nRiver basin (YRB), in eastern PRC. Nanjing municipality has a population \nof  6.4  million,  and  an  urban  center  population  of  4.5  million.  Rapid \neconomic growth in Nanjing over the past 20 years has placed increased \npressure on the environment and city infrastructure. The Qinhuai River is \n110 kilometers (km) long and flows through the urban districts of Nanjing \nbefore joining the YRB. Water quality in the lower 34 km of the Qinhuai \nRiver has deteriorated significantly in the past 10 years mainly due to \nwastewater discharge from the city; it currently fails to achieve class V of \nthe PRC water quality standards.  \n \n  The lack of sufficient wastewater collection and treatment facilities and the \nincreasingly  severe  problems  related  to  water  pollution  and  urban \ndrainage have resulted in serious water quality problems in the Qinhuai \nRiver. This has resulted in significant deterioration of water quality in the \nNanjing section of the YRB. NMG is implementing the city\u2019s strategic \nwastewater  master  plan  to  meet  national  environmental  targets  and \nachieve  a  wastewater  treatment  rate  of  85%  by  2010.  The  proposed \nProject is an integrated part of the basin-wide Yangtze water resources \nmanagement  initiative,  the  Nanjing  city  urban  development  plan,  the \nNanjing municipal wastewater master plan, and the Nanjing stormwater \ndrainage master plan. The Project will provide the 10% additional capacity \ncritical  to  achieving  the  city\u2019s  target  for  2010  of  treating  85%  of  the \nwastewater generated compared with the current rate of 75%.  \n \nThe high intensity of rainfall in Nanjing places the urban drainage system \nunder  stress;  sewers  overflow  and  become  major  sources  of  water \npollution.  Flooding  in  urban  areas  is  often  serious  because  of  the \ninadequately  maintained  drainage  network  and  pumping  stations  with \ninsufficient capacity. Nanjing does not have a consistent sludge treatment \nand disposal scheme. Historically, the Qinhuai River\u2019s tributaries were \ninterconnected  with  sufficient  flow  capacity,  but  siltation  has  greatly \nreduced flows from these waterways. At some locations flow is completely \nblocked, aggravating flooding and water pollution. Augmentation of river \nflow, and improved flood control and water quality are urgently needed \nthrough (i) river dredging, (ii) river bank stabilization and erosion control, \n(iii) river water diversion and replenishment, and (iv) restoration of the \ndegraded urban wetland area. By significantly improving the water quality \nin the Qinhuai River from the current class V to class IV by 2011, the ", "  vii\nProject will complement the Wuhan Wastewater Management Project, \nWuhan Wastewater and Stormwater Management Project, and Suzhou \nCreek Rehabilitation Project, which all contribute to reducing pollution in \nthe YRB. Since the drinking water intakes of Nanjing and other major \ncities  downstream  are  from  the  Yangtze  River,  the  Project  will  also \ncontribute to protecting the drinking water source.  \n   \nImpact and  The impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment, public \nOutcome  health, and quality of life of urban residents and businesses in Nanjing \nCity. The outcome of the Project is improved management of surface \nwater resources in Nanjing.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $236.1 million, including \ntaxes and duties. \n   \nFinancing Plan   \n  Amount   \n   \nSource  ($ million)  Percent \n \nAsian Development Bank  100.0  42 \n \nNanjing Municipal Government  81.2  35   \nCofinancing: China Development Bank  54.9  23   \n  Total  236.1  100   \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nA  loan  of  $100  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)\u2013based \nlending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nThe ADB loan will finance 42% of the project cost. NMG will finance 58% \nthrough a combination of wastewater tariffs ($20 million), NMG budget \nsources, and a domestic loan from the China Development Bank. \n   \nAllocation and  The  PRC  Government  will  relend  the  loan  proceeds  to  the  Jiangsu \nRelending Terms  provincial government, which will onlend the loan proceeds to NMG, the \nExecuting Agency, on the same principle terms and conditions as those of \nthe ADB loan, including the interest rate, tenor, and grace period. Part of \nthe loan proceeds will be onlent to NCIC, the IA for the City East river \nimprovement, wastewater treatment, and sewerage activities on the same \nterms and conditions as those of the ADB loan. The balance of the loan \nwill  be  applied  directly,  on  behalf  of  NMG,  by  Nanjing  Drainage \nManagement Department (NDMD), the IA for the stormwater activities, \nand Nanjing Municipal Engineering Construction Department (NMECD), \nthe IA for Inner Qinhuai River sewerage and water replenishment, North \nHe Xi District sewerage, river improvement and water replenishment, and \nthe  sludge  treatment  activities.  The  end-borrower  for  the  revenue-\ngenerating  components  and  NMG  for  the  non-revenue-generating \ncomponents will assume the foreign exchange and interest rate variation \nrisks of the ADB loan. \n   \n ", "viii  \nPeriod of  Until 30 June 2012  \nUtilization \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2011 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project leading group has been established, headed by the vice mayor \nArrangements  of NMG and with representatives from Nanjing\u2019s Municipal Development \nand  Reform  Commission,  Construction  Commission,  Finance  Bureau, \nPlanning  Bureau,  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  Public  Utilities \nBureau, and Urban Construction Investment Holding (Group) Company. \nThe project leading group will provide overall policy guidance, facilitate \ninteragency  coordination,  and  resolve  institutional  problems  that  could \naffect project implementation. A fully staffed Nanjing project management \noffice, established for the Project, will act as the secretariat of the project \nleading group, and coordinate and monitor implementation activities of the \nthree IAs.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Nanjing Municipal Government \n   \nProcurement  ADB-financed equipment, materials and goods, works, and services will \nbe procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006), as \namended  from  time  to  time.  Procurement  will  be  coursed  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  national  competitive  bidding,  or \nshopping procedures as determined by the particular circumstances of \neach  contract  package.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines,  foreign  contractors  may  participate  in  bidding  for  national \ncompetitive bidding contracts. \n   \nConsulting  About  31  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  100  person-\nServices  months of national consulting, to be funded under the Project, will be \nrequired  to  support  the  project  management  office  and  IAs  in  project \nimplementation and capacity building. Consulting services will be provided \nin the following specific areas: (i) development of a sludge management \nstrategy for Nanjing, (ii) investigation and control of inflow and infiltration \ninto the wastewater collection network, (iii) construction supervision and \nquality  control,  (iv)  financial  management,  and  (v)  operation  and \nmaintenance  improvements.  The  international  consultants  will  also \nprovide training and capacity building in wastewater management and \ntreatment  planning,  water  quality  management,  financial management, \nand environmental monitoring and management. Consultant recruitment \nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006),  as \namended from time to time.  \n   \nProject Benefits  The  Project  will  benefit  about  2.7  million  urban  residents  of  Nanjing, \nand Beneficiaries  whose living conditions and public health standards will improve as a \nresult of (i) reduced pollution of Nanjing\u2019s surface water, (ii) protection \nfrom flooding and elimination of hazards associated with poor drainage, \nand (iii) reduction in the incidence of waterborne infectious diseases to \nbelow the 2005/06 level of 43 per 1,000 people. The Project will improve \nthe management of surface water resources in Nanjing by (i) achieving ", "  ix\ntreatment  of  85%  of  wastewater  generated  by  2010  and  significantly \nreducing annual pollution loads in the Qinhuai River and thereby in the \nYRB; (ii) significantly reducing flooding in urban areas; (iii) increasing the \nefficiency and management capacity of the IAs; and (iv) improving cost \nrecovery  through  a  better  tariff  structure,  with  gradual  increases  to \nachieve full cost recovery. The water quality improvements in the Qinhuai \nRiver and subsequently in the Nanjing section of the YRB will contribute \nto integrated water resource management and pollution control, basin \nmanagement, and transboundary pollution prevention and control. The \nstormwater management component will improve flood control in urban \nareas by (i) improving the drainage-sewerage network; and (ii) separating \nstormwater and wastewater flows into different systems, and rehabilitating \ndefective pipes. This will minimize waterborne disease; accidents; injuries \nand loss of life; and damage to property, agriculture, and infrastructure. \n \nThe Project will create at least 450 full-time permanent jobs with NCIC, \nNDMD, and NMECD for the operation of the facilities; and 6,000 person-\nyears of work during the 5 years of construction. More than 40% of the \nconstruction jobs are expected to be filled by the poor and vulnerable, \nincluding  the  unemployed,  rural  migrants,  and  women.  Public  health \nbenefits  will  accrue  through  an  estimated  reduction  in  medical  costs \nincurred  as  a  result  of  decreasing  waterborne  diseases,  amounting  to \napproximately CNY142 per person per year. The financing of wastewater \ntreatment infrastructure directly from wastewater tariff increases will have \na demonstration impact on wastewater tariff reform in both the PRC and \nelsewhere  in  Asia.  The  Project  is  technically  sound,  affordable  to \nbeneficiaries, and financially and economically viable.  \n \nRisks  Potential  institutional,  financial,  and  policy  risks  related  to  the  Project \nand Assumptions  include  failure  of  NMG  to  (i)  implement  institutional  strengthening  for \neffective project management, (ii) increase water and wastewater tariffs to \nmeet  cost-recovery  targets,  and  (iii)  meet  the  equity  requirements  to \nimplement the Project. These risks have been mitigated by (i) obtaining \nassurances from the Jiangsu provincial government and NMG on the \nfinancial  and  managerial  autonomy  of  the  IAs,  and  institutional \nstrengthening of the IAs; (ii) periodic water tariff reviews and adjustments \nfollowing the national guidelines; and (iii) provision of counterpart funding. \nADB  review  missions  will  monitor  compliance  with  the  financial  and \noperational covenants to ensure the IAs are financially sustainable. \n \nThe Project does not have any unusual technical risks. The components \nwill use standard technology that  conforms to international standards. \nSpecific construction risks will be mitigated by the use of experienced \nconsultants to prepare designs and monitor project implementation.  \n \n ", "118o  00\u2019E 121o  00\u2019E 110o  00\u2019E 120o  00\u2019E JILIN\nINNER  MONGOLIA\nTieling\nS H A N D O N G Y e l l o w     S e a Shenyang\nGanyu LIAONING\nJingzhou Dandong\nFeng Xian Pei Xian Lianyungang Jining Zhangjiakou Yingkou 40 o 00\u2019N\nLianyungang Hohhot Shanhaiguan\nBohai\n40 o 00\u2019N BEIJING TangshanSea Dalian\nTianjin TIANJIN\nChia Wang Yinchuan HEBEI\nHENAN Xinyi Guanyun Taiyuan Shijiazhuang Yantai\nPei Xian Liulin\nXuzhou Xiangshui Shuyang Qingdao\nSHAANXI Jinan\n34 o 00\u2019N Shuyang 34 o 00\u2019N NINGXIA SHANXXiInxian SHANDONG LianYyeunllgoawng  Sea  \nBinhai\nSuqian\nFuning Weinan SanmLueonyxaiang Zhangzhou Xuzhou JIANGSU\nSiyang Sheyang Baoji Xi'an HENAN\nHuaiyin Hefei Shanghai\nA N H U I Qingjiang NanjingSHANGHAI\nHuai\u2019an Jianhu Nanchang HUBEI ANHUI 30 o 00\u2019N\nSihong Wuhan Anqing\nHangzhou Ningbo\nLongse Yancheng\nHongze Lake  Baoying Dafeng 30 o 00\u2019CNhongqing Jiujiang JingdezhZeHnEJIANG\nCHONGQING Nanchang\n110o  00\u2019EHUNAN 120o  00\u2019E\nXuyi Xinghua\nDongtai\nNANJING QINHUAI\nGaoyu Lake Gaoyou J I A N G S U\nRIVER ENVIRONMENTAL\nTai Xian Hai\u2019an IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nTaizhou\nN Luhe Yangzhou Jiangdu Rugoo Rudong IN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\nZhenjiang\n32 o 00\u2019N 0 20Kilom40eters60 80 Jiangpu NANJING Daiyang YangtzeJRiinvgerjiaJniagngyinNantonNgantongHainen 32 o 00\u2019N\nJiangning Jurong Zhangjiagang\nNational Capital Qidong\nPROJECT AREA Jintan Changzhou\nProvincial Capital\nChangsu\nCNOiatthytie/oTrn oRawlo nRadoad A N H U I Lishui Liyang Wuxi KunshaTnaicang Yangtze River\nYixing\nRailway\nGaochun Suzhou\nRiver\nTai Lake\nWujiang\nProvincial Boundary SHANGHAI\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n0\n6\n-3 M\n2\n02a H 118o  00\u2019E Z H E J I A N G 121o  00\u2019E ap \nR 1", "NANJING QINHUAI RIVER\nENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT\nIN THE\nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA River I.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Nanjing Qinhuai River Environmental Improvement \nProject.  In  line  with  its  long-term  goals  for  the  urban  sector  of  improving  living  conditions, \nminimizing flooding incidents, protecting water resources, and enhancing wastewater treatment \ncoverage,  the  PRC  Government  asked  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  in \nimplementing wastewater, stormwater, and sludge management, and river improvement projects \nin Nanjing. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy1 and will help the PRC achieve \nMillennium Development Goal 7, target 10, which calls for halving, by 2015, the proportion of \npeople without access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation. This report is based on the \nloan  Appraisal  Mission  and  discussions  with  the  central  and  local  governments,  relevant \nagencies, and community organizations. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Annual economic growth in the PRC, which averaged 9% over the last 20 years, is \nprojected to average 7% over the next 5 years. The urban population has grown from about 190 \nmillion in 1980 to about 543 million in 2004, about 42% of the total population, and is expected to \nincrease to 700 million or 50% by 2030. The Government\u2019s Agenda for Economic Reform and \nSocial Development in the New Century2 aims to accelerate urbanization and the development of \nlarge, medium, and small cities and small towns. This urbanization process will continue to \nincrease the demand for all urban services. In particular, it will place a strain on the physical and \nfinancial capacity of most cities to provide adequate urban infrastructure such as wastewater and \nsludge management, and stormwater facilities. Without significant infrastructure investment, the \nquality of life for urban residents and the urban environment will deteriorate, and economic \ndevelopment will be inefficient. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s urban areas face environmental threats from pollution of rivers, lakes, and \nunderground aquifers from untreated water. In 2004, about 48.2 billion cubic meters (m3) of \nwastewater were generated: about 54% from municipal sources and 46% from industrial sources. \nCurrently, about 90% of industrial wastewater is treated before discharge to a municipal sewer. \nMunicipal wastewater is a major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes. As of 2004, \nonly about 45.2% (34% in 1999) of urban wastewater was treated; the rest was discharged \nuntreated to rivers and lakes. About 41.8% of the water in the seven major river basins3 does not \nmeet the class III4 national water quality standard. Surface water sources serving municipal water \nsupply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under water quality standards. To address the \npollution  of  lakes  and  rivers,  the  following  actions  are  needed:  (i)  strengthen  laws  and \nenforcement, regulations, and institutions to address transjurisdictional pollution; (ii) adopt river \nbasin management approaches for water resource management; (iii) reduce nonpoint source \npollution; (iv) continue investment in municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), sludge \nmanagement,  and  stormwater  drainage  systems  to  mitigate  the  polluting  effects  of  rapidly \nincreasing urbanization; (v) diversify financing sources for environmental investments; and (vi) \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  The Government\u2019s long-term vision for development was set out during the 16th Party Congress in November 2000 \nand reiterated during the 10th National People\u2019s Congress in March 2003.  \n3  Changjiang (Yangtze River), Haihe, Huaihe, Huanghe Liaohe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang.  \n4  The PRC water quality standards have five classes of quality covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is \npristine, while class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal \nwater supply. ", "2   \ncontinue  with  institutional  and  financial  reforms  to  facilitate  balanced  economic  growth  and \nenvironmental  sustainability.  Significant  investments  are  needed  nationally  to  solve  water \nshortage problems, supply clean drinking water, expand wastewater treatment capacity, and \nreduce flooding.  \n \n4.  Recognizing that adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are essential \nfor sustainable economic growth, the Government incorporated environmental protection as a \nnational priority in its development strategy. In addition to enacting environmental protection laws \nand implementing regulations that emphasize preventive measures, the polluter pays principle, \nand decentralized environmental management, the Government has also undertaken numerous \nprograms  including  those  for  wastewater  management.5 Industries  were  ordered  to  treat \nwastewater to national wastewater discharge standards by the end of 2000; municipalities have \nbeen required under successive 5-year plans to address wastewater collection, treatment and \ndisposal; and pollution control plans have been developed and partially implemented for the key \nriver  basins.  Government  policies  require  that  urban  environmental  pollution  and  ecological \ndamage be controlled by 2010; and recent state guidelines require that major cities, such as \nprovincial capitals, have wastewater treatment rates of at least 80% by 2010 (Nanjing\u2019s target is \n85%).6 The State Environmental Protection Administration requires that all new WWTPs provide \nat least secondary wastewater treatment. The treatment level required is also dependent on the \nwater quality class of the receiving water. \n \n5.  The  Government  has  accorded  priority  in  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  to \naddressing  wastewater  treatment  issues  through  policy  reform,  increased  investment,  and \nimproved urban infrastructure management. The Government\u2019s strategy focuses on (i) protecting \ndrinking water sources by controlling industrial and other pollution in urban areas; (ii) introducing \nwater efficient technologies and operations; and (iii) using appropriate pricing mechanisms to \nencourage  conservation  and  generate  necessary  funds  for  operation,  maintenance,  and \ninvestment. The Government\u2019s ongoing economic and enterprise reform programs require that all \nwastewater projects be financially sustainable and capable of cost recovery. The sector analysis \nis given in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n6.  Traditional urban wastewater management practice in the PRC was based on the use of \nseptic tanks. Rapidly increasing urbanization makes such an approach inadequate. Over the past \ndecade a fundamental shift has been to an integrated approach to urban water management and \nuse of centralized municipal wastewater treatment. Although much improvement has been made, \nthe current status of wastewater management still provides numerous opportunities to reduce \nwater pollution, protect water resources, and improve the living conditions and public health of \nurban and suburban residents. Key problems and opportunities in Nanjing include (i) worsening \nsurface  water  quality,  (ii)  inadequate  wastewater  treatment  capacity,  (iii)  lack  of  a  sludge \ntreatment facility and disposal site, (iv) inadequate stormwater discharge capacity resulting in \nfrequent urban flooding, (v) high river siltation contributing to formation of organic substances that \npollute rivers, and (vi) the need for ongoing financial and institutional reforms to make urban \nservices sustainable. \n \n                                                 \n5  The PRC Law on Prevention and Control of Water Pollution was first adopted in 1984 and amended in 1996. The law \nwas enacted to prevent and control water pollution, protect and improve the environment, safeguard human health, \nand ensure effective utilization of water resources.  \n6  The national guidelines for construction of municipal wastewater treatment facilities require that all major cities have \na wastewater treatment rate of at least 80% by 2010. National Development and Reform Commission, State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Construction. 2005.  ", "3 \n7.  Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province, is a rapidly developing city with a population of \n6.4 million, of which 4.5 million is urban. Nanjing City comprises 11 districts and two counties that \nstraddle the Yangtze River. It is located in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, about 270 \nkilometers (km) to the northwest of Shanghai. Nanjing is the PRC pilot city for the ADB and \nUnited Nations-HABITAT jointly sponsored Water for Asian Cities program.7 Program initiatives \npiloted with success in Nanjing include (i) capacity building and institutional strengthening to \nimprove  service  efficiency,  and  (ii)  water  education  and  awareness  creation  that  could  be \nreplicable  in  other  PRC  cities.  While  the  design  of  the  proposed  Project  complements  the \nobjectives  and  initiatives  of  the  Water  for  Asian  Cities  program,  the  initiatives  will  not  be \ninterdependent.  \n \n8.  Water Quality in the Yangtze River Basin. The Yangtze River basin (YRB) is the largest \nriver basin in the PRC. The Changjiang Water Resources Commission, which reports to the \nMinistry of Water Resources, has overall responsibility for managing water resources within the \nYRB. The commission has developed a basin management plan that provides a framework for \nmanaging water resources within the YRB. The plan cites the deteriorating water quality of \nYangtze River, and sets out a number of general pollution control targets with specific targets to \nbe developed by individual provinces and cities.  \n \n9.  Project  Rationale. Of the seven major rivers in the PRC, YRB receives the highest \nvolume of total wastewater as it has several major cities along its riverbanks. Effects are felt \nthroughout the downstream reaches and in the East China Sea. Despite the abundant water \nresources, rapid economic growth and continuing urbanization over the last 20 years in Nanjing \nhave resulted in inadequate urban infrastructure, and placed pressure on overloaded facilities.  \n \n10.  The Qinhuai River, referred to as the mother river of Nanjing, is 110 km long and flows \nthrough the urban districts of Nanjing before joining the YRB. Water quality in the lower 34 km of \nthe Qinhuai River has deteriorated significantly in the past 10 years mainly due to wastewater \ndischarge from the city, and currently fails to achieve class V of the PRC water quality standards. \nIn 2004, the city generated  2.46 million m3/day of wastewater, including 1.29 million m3/day of \nindustrial wastewater. The lack of sufficient wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and the \nincreasingly severe problems related to water pollution and urban drainage have resulted in \nserious water quality problems in the Qinhuai River. This has resulted in significant deterioration \nof water quality in the Nanjing section of the YRB. Accordingly, NMG is implementing the city\u2019s \nstrategic  wastewater  master  plan  to  meet  national  environmental  targets  and  achieve  a \nwastewater treatment rate of 85% by 2010.  \n \n11.  The  proposed  Project  is  an  integrated  part  of  the  Yangtze  Basin  water  resources \nmanagement initiative being implemented by the Changjiang Water Resources Commission, \nNanjing City urban development plan, Nanjing municipal wastewater master plan, and Nanjing \nstormwater drainage master plan. Accordingly, the Project is consistent with the thrusts of ADB\u2019s \nwater policy and Urban Sector Strategy.8 The Project will provide the 10% additional capacity \ncritical to achieving the city\u2019s target treating 85% of wastewater generated by 2010, compared \nwith the current rate of 75%. The high intensity of rainfall in Nanjing places the urban drainage \nsystem under stress. Sewers overflow and become major sources of water pollution, and flooding \nin urban areas is often serious because of the inadequately maintained drainage network and \ninadequate capacity of pumping stations. Nanjing does not presently have a consistent sludge \ntreatment and disposal scheme. Consequently, a sludge treatment and disposal facility is urgently \n                                                 \n7  The  program  was  launched  at  the Third  World  Water  Forum  on  18  March  2003,  when  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding was signed between ADB and United Nations-Habitat.   \n8  ADB. 1999. Urban Sector Strategy. Manila. \n ", "4   \nneeded to eliminate the potential of secondary pollution to the environment becoming even more \nserious.  Historically,  the  Qinhuai  River\u2019s  tributaries  were  interconnected  with  sufficient  flow \ncapacity; but siltation has greatly reduced flows from these waterways. At some locations the \nflows are completely blocked, aggravating flooding and water pollution. River flow augmentation, \nflood control, and improved water quality are urgently needed through (i) river dredging, (ii) river \nbank stabilization and erosion control, (iii) river water diversion and replenishment, and (iv) \nrestoration of the degraded urban wetland area. By significantly improving the water quality in the \nQinhuai River from the current class V to class IV by 2011, the Project will complement the two \nongoing Wuhan projects,9 and the completed Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project,10 which all \ncontribute to reducing pollution in the YRB. Since the drinking water intakes of Nanjing and other \nmajor downstream cities are from the Yangtze River, the Project also contributes to protection of \nthe vital drinking water source.  \n \n12.  Policy  Dialogue.  The  Project  supports  and  strengthens  ADB  policy  dialogue  and \ninitiatives  with  NMG  in  several  key  areas  including  (i)  cost  recovery  and  tariff  reform,  (ii) \nwastewater  management,  (iii)  water  conservation,  (iv)  corporate  governance  and  enterprise \nreform,  (v)  safe  and  reliable  arrangements  for  sludge  disposal,  (vi)  transboundary  pollution \nprevention  and  control,  (vii)  stormwater  management  arrangements,  and  (viii)  private  sector \nparticipation. ADB has supported the water tariff reform process through two water tariff study \ntechnical assistance (TA) projects11 with the Ministry of Construction under which the market-\noriented National Guidelines on Water Tariffs were developed, promulgated, and implemented. \nThe  water  tariff  TAs  (i)  strengthened  the  financial  sustainability  of  municipal  water  supply \ncompanies; (ii) piloted implementation of the national guidelines in the selected case study cities \nof Chengdu, Fuzhou, and Zhangjiakou; and (iii) recommended financial regulations for water \nsupply  companies  and  designed  nationwide  training  programs.  The  guidelines  are  being \nimplemented  nationally.  Further,  the  ADB  wastewater  tariff  study  TAs 12  developed  and \nrecommended national guidelines for wastewater tariffs, including tariff calculation methodologies \nthat allow for full cost recovery taking into consideration affordability and social constraints. \nNanjing Price Bureau performed a cost audit of the current and projected water, wastewater, and \nwater  resource  expenses;  and  held  public  hearing  meetings  on  28  August  2006  to  obtain \nendorsement for wastewater tariff increases from the current CNY1.05 per m3, to CNY1.40 per m3 \nby December 2006, and CNY1.60 per m3 by 2010. This indicates Nanjing\u2019s progressiveness in \nadopting tariff reforms. The policy dialogue is in Appendix 3. \n \n13.  External Assistance. Since 1993, ADB has provided 15 loans (Appendix 4) totaling \napproximately $1.5 billion for urban wastewater management and water supply projects. ADB has \nalso provided about $30 million for 42 TA studies to prepare these projects; and to review and \nstudy key issues in water resources, urban water supply, wastewater treatment, and pollution \ncontrol. To help NMG develop and implement its strategic wastewater master plan, external \nassistance to date has been provided by ADB, World Bank, and the governments of Finland and \nPoland.  ADB,  World  Bank,  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation,  and  several  bilateral \ndevelopment partners have provided financial and TA to the PRC Government in the urban \nenvironmental protection and management subsector. The World Bank has provided financial \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2003.

ADB\u2019s water supply loan projects in the PRC have generally been implemented \nwell.13 The  lessons  identified  from  ADB\u2019s  post-evaluation  experience  in  water  supply  and \nsanitation highlight the importance of integrating both supply and demand concerns into project \ndesign.  Encouraging  broad  reforms,  such  as  commercial  management,  and  introducing \ncompetition  will  promote  efficient  and  responsive  delivery  of  water  supply  and  wastewater \nservices. Appropriate pricing policies for water and sanitation services are also required. Other \nlessons include the need to (i) review technical designs thoroughly; (ii) consider local conditions \nand constraints; (iii) support financial reform, particularly in establishing autonomous wastewater \nentities and tariff increases to ensure sustainability; (iv) strengthen institutions, particularly by \ngiving them managerial autonomy; (v) educate the public in environmental improvement; (vi) \nconsult the public and involve the community; (vii) address resettlement issues early; and (viii) \nsupport public-private partnerships in water supply and wastewater treatment. A performance \nportfolio  review  of  the  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  waste  management  sector,  recently \ncompleted  by  the  PRC,  identified  successes  and  deficiencies,  and  lessons  from  portfolio \nperformance.14 Among the major issues identified were (i) delays in the start-up of projects and in \nprocurement,  (ii)  weak  institutional  arrangements  for  project  implementation  and  sustainable \noperations,  and  (iii)  a  low  proportion  of  civil  works  financing  resulting  in  loan  savings  and \ncancellation  of  surplus  loan  amounts.  These  issues  were  reviewed  in  detail  during  project \nprocessing and the relevant lessons were incorporated in the project design. Lessons from the \nSuzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project include the need to (i) carefully design and establish project \nimplementation arrangements to allow effective coordination with related agencies, (ii) assess \ncapacity to implement resettlement activities, (iii) exercise caution in estimating water supply \nsales and forecasts, and (iv) increase flexibility in the percentage of ADB financing for civil works \nto prevent potential loan cancellations. These lessons have been incorporated in the design of \nthe proposed Project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n15.  The impact of the Project is to improve the urban environment, public health, and quality \nof life of urban residents and businesses in Nanjing City. The outcome of the Project is improved \nmanagement of surface water resources in Nanjing.   \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n16.  The Project outputs include (i) improved and expanded wastewater services and sludge \nmanagement in the urban area of Nanjing; (ii) improved water quality in the Qinhuai River and \ndownstream  reaches  of  the  YRB;  (iii)  improved  river  management  and  reduced  flooding  in \nstormwater drainage areas in Bai Xia, Gulou, Qinhuai, Xiaguan, and Xuanwu in Nanjing; and (iv) \nmore efficient and better managed implementing agencies (IAs). These outputs will be delivered \nthrough six components: (i) Inner Qinhuai River sewerage and water replenishment, (ii) City East \nWWTP and sewerage system, (iii) North He Xi District sewerage, river improvement, and water \n                                                 \n13  In the project completion reports, the Dalian Water Supply Project was rated as generally successful; and the Anhui \nEnvironmental Improvement Project, Fuzhou Water Supply and Wastewater Treatment Project, and Suzhou Creek \nRehabilitation Project were all rated as highly successful.

Final Report. \nManila.  \n ", "6   \nreplenishment, (iv) stormwater drainage, (v) sludge treatment and disposal component, and (vi) \ninstitutional  development.  All  the  components  will  contribute  to  significantly  improving  water \nquality in the Qinhuai River from the current class V and below, to at least class IV by 2011; and \nreducing pollution in the YRB. A detailed description of project components is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n17.  Inner  Qinhuai  River  Sewerage  and  Water  Replenishment.  This component will (i) \nupgrade the Da Zhong Qiao pumping station and construct 9.6 km of sewer interceptors in the \ncentral  and  southern  areas  of  the  Inner  Qinhuai  River;  and  (ii)  conduct  river  dredging, \nembankment works, and river water diversion and replenishment to improve the inner Qinhuai \nRiver and its tributaries. In addition to improving wastewater interception, this component will \naugment the river flow, improve water quality through flushing, and remove silt through dredging, \nthereby increasing the flood storage capacity of the Qinhuai River and its tributaries.   \n  \n18.  City East Wastewater Treatment Plant and Sewerage System. This component will (i) \nconstruct 23.2 km of sewer pipelines in the south and north districts of the Qinhuai River; (ii) add \nadditional  treatment  capacity  of  100,000  m3/day  to  the  existing  WWTP  including  a  sludge \ndewatering  facility,  tertiary  filtration  and  ultraviolet  disinfection,  and  outlet  pumping  station \nequipment; (iii) improve the Upper Qinhuai River (18 km), a tributary of Qinhuai River, from Xi Bei \nvillage to the Yunliang River by strengthening the embankment foundation and water proofing, \ndredging, and providing water and soil conservation; (iv) improve the South River (9.8 km), a \ntributary of the Qinhuai River, by strengthening and waterproofing the embankment foundation, \nand dredging; and (iv) restore the ecology of 1.5 km of the embankment for the Yunliang River, \nand construct an ecological wetland park (33 ha) at the confluence of the Yunliang and Outer \nQinhuai rivers. This component will help to achieve Nanjing\u2019s wastewater treatment rate target of \n85% by 2010. Further, it will improve the flushing, water quality, and flood storage capacity of the \nQinhuai River and its tributaries. The wetland park subcomponent will restore a derelict site into a \nlowland wetland that was functional some 30 years ago. The wetland park (i) is part of Nanjing \nCity\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan targets for green space; (ii) reduces the adverse impacts of existing \nland  use  and  would  contribute  to  improvement  of  water  quality,  flood  storage,  and  habitat \nconservation;  and  (iii)  provides  recreational  and  educational  opportunities  to  demonstrate \nemerging conservation technologies.   \n \n19.  North He Xi District Sewerage, River Improvement, and Water Replenishment. This \ncomponent will (i) construct 28.7 km of sewer pipelines in the northern area of North He Xi; (ii) \nimprove the Long Jiang River and Qing Jiang North Aqueduct by dredging and constructing 450 \nmeters  (m)  of  box  culvert;  (iii)  improve  the  water  balance  in  the  Long  Jiang  area  by  (a) \nconstructing diversion pipelines and two new gates on Zhong Bao River, and (b) upgrading \ngravity culverts for the Xiao Dou Men and Li Wei pumping stations; and (iv) replenish the central \nand south regions of North He Xi District by constructing a new South River pumping station with \nultimate capacity of 5 m3 per second. This component will help achieve Nanjing\u2019s wastewater \ntreatment rate target of 85% by 2010 and improve the flushing, water quality, and flood storage \ncapacity of the Qinhuai River and its tributaries. For the above three components, as a result of \nincreasing  the  wastewater  treatment  and  collection  capacity,  adequate  flushing  and  water \nexchange, strengthening the river embankment foundations, improving the river, and providing \nbenefits of flood protection, significant improvement of water quality and ecological landscape will \nbe achieved. \n \n20.  Stormwater Drainage System. This component will construct 29 storm drain outlets and \n25 km of drainage pipelines, in the districts of Bai Xia, Gulou, Qinhuai, Xia Guan, and Xuanwu; \nthus contributing to Nanjing\u2019s stormwater master plan. The stormwater component will enhance \nthe performance of the drainage system in flooded areas, reduce overflows from the combined ", "7 \nsewer network and polluted runoff into rivers, and significantly improve flood control in several \nurban areas of Nanjing.  \n \n21.  Sludge Treatment and Disposal. This component will provide treatment and disposal of \nsewage  sludge  and  municipal  sludge  from  river  dredging  and  maintenance  of  the  pipeline \nnetwork. It will construct the (i) Jiang Xin Zhou WWTP sludge treatment facility with a capacity of \n80 tons/day (dry solid), and (ii) Mount Feng Huang sludge disposal facility with a capacity of 840 \nm3/day and the leachate collection and treatment system. Without this component, secondary \npollution to the environment would become very serious.  \n \n22.  Institutional  Development.  This  component  will  (i)  carry  out  a  sludge  management \nstudy; (ii) provide training to strengthen organizational structure and staff resources to implement, \noperate, and maintain the project components; (iii) strengthen management practices in human \nresources, finance, and corporate planning; and (iv) provide training programs for managers and \nstaff  responsible  for  service  delivery  to  ensure  efficient  implementation  and  sustainability  of \nproject benefits. The Project will strengthen institutional capacity to facilitate the adoption of an \nintegrated approach to water resource management including pollution and flood control.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n23.  Public-Private  Participation. The Project takes a comprehensive approach including \nclose cooperation with ADB\u2019s private sector operations to support NMG\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan for \nexpansion of the city\u2019s water and wastewater treatment capacity. NMG is planning to issue a \nwater bond, one of the first in the PRC. In support, ADB is implementing an advisory TA for \nNanjing Water Utility Long-Term Capital Finance in Commercial Markets, and processing the \nNanjing Water Utility Development Project, which will provide a partial credit guarantee15 for up to \n50% of a bond issue by Nanjing Public Utilities Company (NPUC),16 a subsidiary of Nanjing \nConstruction Investment Company (NCIC) (the IA for the wastewater treatment component under \nthe proposed Project). The advisory TA supported NCIC and NPUC by (i) building capacity, \nincluding  management  structuring,  and  developing  corporate  governance  best  practices;  (ii) \ndeveloping accounting and auditing practice in line with best international practices; (iii) preparing \nthe bond application; and (iv) providing a shadow bond rating and issuer rating exercise. NPUC \nplans to use the proceeds from the bond issue for capital expenditure requirements for seven \nnew water and wastewater treatment projects in Nanjing. The structure, mechanics, and details of \nADB\u2019s  partial  credit  guarantee  will  be  determined  during  the  due  diligence  expected  to  be \ncompleted in November 2006, to be followed by the Credit Committee meeting scheduled for \nDecember 2006. The proposed partial credit guarantee is expected to be submitted to the ADB \nBoard for consideration within the first quarter of 2007. \n \n24.  Significant  synergies  have  been  derived  from  the  public-private  approach  to \ncomprehensively improving the urban environment in Nanjing. The successful policy dialogue on \nwastewater  tariff  reforms,  thorough  examination  of  safeguard  issues  and  compliance \nrequirements, and capacity-building measures undertaken by the proposed Project will support \nthe Nanjing Water Utility Development Project. NMG has confirmed the counterpart financing \nsources for the Project. However, NMG during implementation would have the option to replace \nsome of the committed counterpart funds for the Project with funds generated from the potential \nbond  issue.  The  Nanjing  Water  Utility  Development  Project  and  the  proposed  Project  are \nautonomous but mutually supportive. The public-private approach in Nanjing could be replicated \n                                                 \n15  The concept paper for the project was approved by Management on 9 October 2006. \n16  Currently, the application for bond issuance is pending with the National Development and Reform Commission.  \n ", "8   \nin the upcoming Jilin Urban Infrastructure Project17 in Jilin Province and elsewhere in the PRC. \nThe bond issue represents a new avenue of financing, facilitated through the bond guarantee \nprovided by the private sector, ensuring that the water utilities sector in the PRC will have access \nto finance the significant demand in water and wastewater treatment infrastructure investment \nneeds. \n \n25.  Tariff  Reform.  NMG  has  committed  to  generate  funds  to  finance  the  wastewater \ncomponents of the Project from wastewater tariff increases estimated at $20 million. This is a \nmajor reform in line with ADB\u2019s Water Policy (2001). NMG held public hearing meetings on 28 \nAugust 2006 to obtain endorsement for wastewater tariff increases, from the current CNY1.05 per \nm3, to CNY1.40 per m3 by December 2006, and CNY1.60 per m3 by 2010. These significant tariff \nreforms contribute to sustainability of the Project and to private sector participation initiatives.   \n \n26.  Environmental  Aspects.  The  Project  includes  (i)  training  in  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of wastewater and stormwater facilities to ensure effective operation; (ii) \nmonitoring of future performance of O&M of the wastewater and stormwater facilities using a \nnumber of indicators outlined in the design and monitoring framework; (iii) demonstration of the \npotential economic benefits of an integrated and strategic long-term approach to planning of \nwastewater, sludge treatment, and stormwater infrastructure facilities; and (iv) assistance in the \ndevelopment of Qinhuai River water quality modeling including ambient water monitoring to \nprotect water resources, promote sustainable economic development, and improve the living \nconditions and public health of urban residents.  \n \n27.  Governance  and  Anticorruption.  The  additional  governance  and  anticorruption \nmeasures, including the requirement to enhance and develop the project website to contain \ninformation  on  project  audited  financial  statements,  the  status  of  procurement  and  contract \nawards, tariff increases, and a schedule for public hearings, will contribute to the principle of \ntransparency, accountability, and zero-tolerance for corruption. There are also obligations to \nconduct  performance  audits,  and  various  forms  of  public  disclosure,  public  hearing,  and \nrequirements to give reasons for administrative decisions. \n \n28.  Pro-Poor Features. NMG has agreed that prior to implementing any tariff increases, it will \nreview and conduct research to determine the number of poor people likely to be affected by the \nwastewater tariff increases, and prepare a plan or scheme including price subsidies and lifeline \ntariffs to contribute to cushioning the impact of tariff increases on the poor. NMG will issue this as \na decree.  \n \n29.  Optimum Design. Through rigorous least-cost analysis and engineering consulting, the \ntechnical design of the Project was optimized. Consequently, the resettlement impact of the \nProject was reduced by 30%, resulting in a reduction of the resettlement cost. \n \n30.  Employment, Labor, and Health. The Project reflects assurances that the Government \nwill  ensure  that  (i)  equal  employment  opportunities  be  provided  for  men  and  women,  (ii) \ninformation be given to employees on sexually transmitted diseases and HIV/Aids, (iii) awareness \nis increased on the health impacts of wastewater, and (iv) child labor be prohibited.   \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n17  The TA (ADB. 2006.

Financing Plan \n \n32.  The Government has requested a loan of $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility for US dollar loans, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  agreement.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication \nor advice from ADB.  \n \n33.  The ADB loan will finance 42% of the project cost. NMG will finance the contingencies \nand interest during construction. Local costs will be financed from wastewater treatment fees, \n(estimated at $20 million), urban construction fees, and domestic loans from PRC banks. NMG \n ", "10   \nhas issued a commitment letter confirming the counterpart funds including the equity injection. \nFurther, the China Development Bank provided a commitment letter for the domestic bank loan \ncofinancing.

The Government will relend the funds to the Jiangsu Provincial Government (JPG) and \nthen to NMG. NMG will onlend a portion of the loan proceeds to NCIC, which will implement the \nCity East river improvement, wastewater treatment, and sewerage component. NMG will onlend \nthe balance of the loan proceeds to Nanjing Drainage Management Department (NDMD) and \nNanjing Municipal Engineering Construction Department (NMECD), which will implement the \nsludge management, stormwater management, and river replenishment components. NMG will \nassume full financial responsibility for all the non-revenue-generating components. All onlending \nwill be on the same terms and conditions as the ADB loan. The end-borrower for the revenue-\ngenerating components and NMG for the non-revenue-generating components will assume the \nforeign  exchange  and  interest  rate  variation  risks  of  the  ADB  loan.  The  flow  of  funds  and \nonlending arrangements are in Appendix 6.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n35.  NMG will be the Executing Agency. A project leading group has been established, headed \nby the vice mayor of NMG and comprising representatives from Nanjing Municipal Construction \nCommission,  Municipal  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Planning  Bureau,  Finance \nBureau,  Environmental  Protection  Bureau,  Public  Utilities  Bureau,  and  Urban  Construction \nInvestment Holding (Group) Co Ltd. The group will provide overall policy guidance, facilitate \ninteragency coordination, and resolve any institutional problems affecting project implementation. \nA fully staffed Nanjing project management office (PMO) has been established for the Project. \nThe PMO will also be the secretariat of the project leading group. The three IAs are  \n \n(i)  NCIC for the City East WWTP and sewerage component which includes sewer \npipelines, wastewater treatment plant, and river improvement;  \n(ii)  NDMD for the stormwater drainage component and  \n(iii)  NMECD  for  the  Inner  Qinhuai  River  sewerage  and  water  replenishment \ncomponent;  North  He  Xi  District  sewerage,  river  improvement,  and  water \nreplenishment component; and sludge treatment and disposal component.  \n \n36.  On completion of the Project, NCIC will be responsible for O&M of the City East river \nimprovement  works  and  wastewater  treatment  plant.  The  Municipal  Facilities  Management \nDepartment (Municipal Public Utilities Bureau) will be responsible for O&M of all other facilities.  \n \n37.  The financial, technical, and institutional capacity of the three IAs was assessed. NCIC \nhas received capacity-building support from the ADB private sector TA. NDMD and NMECD will \nneed some training in relevant ADB procedures during project implementation. NCIC will directly ", "11 \nmanage construction, NDMD and NMECD will outsource this activity to an experienced and \nqualified construction management company. Once the stormwater facilities are built, NDMD will \npass them on to the district water bureau for O&M. The IAs will retain the services of design \ninstitutes and specialist procurement agencies to help with implementation. With the help of \ninternational consultants, the Nanjing PMO and the IAs will develop expertise in (i) efficient \noperation of the wastewater, stormwater, and sludge management facilities; and (ii) functional \nareas  of  administration,  finance,  accounting,  and  business  planning.  The  institutional  and \ncapacity-building measures are detailed in Supplementary Appendix C. NCIC\u2019s internal controls \nand  accounting  and  auditing  procedures  were  reviewed  through  a  financial  management \nassessment  (Appendix  7).  This  assessment  confirms  the  adequacy  of  NCIC\u2019s  financial \nmanagement  practices  for  both  the  construction  and  operational  phase  of  the  Project.  But \ndiscussions  concerning  the  financial  management  of  stormwater  and  sludge  management \nservices indicate a need for improvement. On the basis of assessment of the IAs\u2019 financial and \nmanagerial capabilities, the Project is deemed sustainable as indicated in Appendix 8. The IAs\u2019 \ntechnical  and  institutional  capacities  were  assessed  and  found  to  be  adequate  for  project \nimplementation.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n38.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, from 2007 to 2011 (Appendix 9). This \nschedule is considered realistic as the project implementation structure is already in place, and \npreparatory works are under way. ADB\u2019s successful experience with similar projects in the PRC \nand  NMG,  and  the  IAs\u2019  in-depth  knowledge  and  experience  in  stormwater  and  wastewater \nindicate that this schedule is achievable. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n39.  Equipment, materials and goods, civil works, and services financed under the loan will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time \nto time). Equipment, materials, goods, and services will follow ADB procedures for international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) for packages each with a value greater than $1 million. Equipment, \nmaterials, and goods with estimated contract value of $100,000 or less will be procured using \nshopping procedures. Civil works contracts costing more than $10 million will be procured using \nICB. Civil works contracts valued at the equivalent of $10 million or less can be procured using \nnational competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the PRC\u2019s Tendering and Bidding \nLaw (1999), subject to clarifications to the law that have been agreed with ADB for the purposes \nof ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.18 The selection and engagement of contractors will be subject \nto ADB approval.19 The procurement plan is in Appendix 10. Major equipment will be purchased \nthrough ICB procedures and financed by the ADB loan. The internationally tendered equipment \npackages will include the necessary technical support for ensuring proper installation, testing, \ncommissioning, and training of operations staff as part of the related contracts. In accordance \nwith ADB requirements, foreign contractors may participate in bidding for national competitive \nbidding contracts.  \n \n                                                 \n18  ADB. 1997.

Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor Implementation of the Tendering and Bidding Law and Related Regulations. Manila. Schedule 4 of the Loan \nAgreement. \n19  ADB will require the PMO to use ADB-approved standard bidding documents (to be developed as necessary) to \nensure high quality and consistency of the documents; this will facilitate ADB review. A draft project administration \nmemorandum to this effect has been prepared and was discussed at loan appraisal. \n ", "12   \n4.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n40.  ADB  approved  the  Government\u2019s  request  for  advance  contracting,  which  includes \nrecruitment  of  consultants,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  civil  works;  and  the  request  for \nretroactive financing of eligible expenditures up to $20 million (equivalent to 20% of the ADB loan), \nincurred prior to loan effectiveness but not earlier than a maximum of 12 months before the \nsigning of the loan.20 Advance contracting will include (i) tendering and bid evaluation for civil \nworks contract packages; (ii) preparation of tender documents for the procurement of materials, \nplant, equipment, and vehicles; (iii) award of contracts; and (iv) recruitment of consultants. The \nissuance of invitations to bid under advance procurement action will be subject to ADB approval. \nAll advance procurement actions will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time).  \nNMG has requested retroactive financing for civil works and equipment for part of the Inner \nQinhuai River water replenishment component, City East river improvement component, and \nNorth He Xi water replenishment and river improvement component. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the Project. Contracts proposed for retroactive financing will be undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n41.  Provision has been made for 31 person-months of international and 100 person-months of \nnational consulting services to be funded under the Project to support the Nanjing PMO and IAs \nin project implementation and capacity building. A consulting firm will be recruited in accordance \nwith Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the quality- and cost-based selection method \nand  requesting  full  technical  proposals.  The  scope  and  extent  of  consulting  services  takes \naccount of the consulting support incorporated into the Nanjing Water Utility Long-Term Capital \nFinance  in  Commercial  Markets  TA  for  strengthening  NCIC  and  the  United  Nations-Habitat \ncapacity-building measures under the Water for Asian Cities program. Consulting services are \nrequired for (i) developing a sludge management strategy for Nanjing; (ii) investigating and \ncontrolling  inflow  and  infiltration  into  the  wastewater  collection  network;  (iii)  supervising \nconstruction, quality control, and related monitoring of progress during project implementation; \n(iv) monitoring resettlement; (v) improving stormwater and sewerage management; (vi) improving \nflood protection systems; (vii) helping with private sector participation initiatives; (viii) supporting \nfinancial management; and (ix) improving O&M. Capacity building for the IAs will be achieved \nthrough consultant inputs, hands-on training, and domestic and international training financed \nfrom the loan. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services and indicative budget is \nin Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n42.  To facilitate funds flow and project implementation, Jiangsu Provincial Finance Bureau will \nestablish an imprest account once the loan becomes effective, in accordance with the provisions \nof ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook as amended from time to time. Disbursements from the \nimprest  account  must  be  supported  by  an  appropriate  withdrawal  application  and  related \ndocumentation. The documentation will demonstrate that the goods or services (i) were produced \nin and procured from ADB member countries, and (ii) are eligible for ADB financing. The initial \namount  to  be  deposited  in  the  imprest  account  will  not  exceed  6  months  of  estimated \n                                                 \n20  The  advance  action  for  the  procurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants,  and  the  uploading  of  the  general \nprocurement notice on the ADB website, will facilitate the start of the advance action process. ADB Management \napproved advanced contracting and retroactive financing on 26 September 2006.  ", "13 \nexpenditures for the Project or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The statement of \nexpenditure procedure may be used for reimbursement or liquidation of eligible expenditures. \nIndividual payments under the statement of expenditure procedure should not exceed $200,000.21 \nDirect payment procedures will be used for large contracts. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n43.  The PMO will prepare semiannual progress reports indicating progress made, problems \nencountered during the period under review, steps taken or proposed to remedy the problems, \nproposed program of activities, and progress expected in the next half year. The IAs will keep \nrecords to identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds, and follow accounting \nprinciples and practices prescribed by the PRC\u2019s Accounting Law. The law requires enterprises to \nprepare financial statements and generally follow internationally accepted accounting standards. \nThe IAs will maintain separate project accounts and records. The financial statements of the \nproject accounts and the annual corporate financial statements for the IAs will be subject to \nexternal audit by the NMG Audit Bureau, Jiangsu Provincial Audit Bureau, and State Audit \nAdministration. The audits will be carried out in accordance with regulations for auditing approved \nby the State Council and will meet ADB requirements. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of \nthe imprest account and statement of expenditure will be part of the audit reports. The IAs\u2019 annual \naudited financial statements and audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB no later than \n6  months  after  the  end  of  the  fiscal  year  for  the  entire  implementation  period.22 The  PRC \nGovernment, JPG, and NMG were informed of ADB\u2019s policy requiring the submission of audited \nfinancial statements on time. JPG, NMG, and the IAs will submit reports and information to ADB \nconcerning the use of the loan proceeds, project implementation, and IA performance. These \nreports will include (i) semiannual progress reports on project implementation; (ii) annual reports; \nand (iii) a project completion report, not later than 12 months after the completion of the project \nfacilities.  \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation  \n \n44.  The project performance monitoring system (PPMS) indicators include (i) service levels, \n(ii) treated wastewater quality and other measures of operational performance, (iii) percentage of \nwastewater collected and treated, (iv) composite incidence of infectious waterborne diseases, (v) \nuser satisfaction with the urban environment, and (vi) relevant economic and health data to \nmonitor project impact. The relevance and practicability of data collection for the indicators was \nconfirmed with the PMO.  \n \n45.  At  the  start  of  project  implementation,  the  PMO  and  IAs,  with  the  assistance  of \nconsultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS procedures to systematically generate data on \nthe  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  project  components;  and  the  socioeconomic,  health,  and \nenvironmental  indicators  to  be  used  to  measure  project  impact.  A  set  of  indicators  for  the \nmonitoring of the future performance of the WWTPs will be designed by the loan implementation \nconsultants before the start of operations. The PMO and IAs will refine the PPMS, confirm \nachievable targets, finalize monitoring and recording arrangements, and establish systems and \nprocedures no later than 6 months after project inception. Under the design and monitoring \nframework, baseline and progress data will be reported at the requisite time intervals, including \nsemiannual reporting provided for in the environmental management plan. The PMO will be \nresponsible for analyzing and consolidating the data through its management information system. \n                                                 \n21 The limits for the imprest account and the statement of expenditure are in accordance with the recent review of \nADB\u2019s PRC portfolio and were set to improve efficiency in loan disbursement. \n22 The IAs now have three tiers of audit including (i) internal audit, (ii) municipal government audit, and (iii) provincial \nand state government audit. \n ", "14   \nThe PPMS will be designed to permit adequate flexibility to adopt remedial action regarding \nproject design, schedules, activities, and development impact. The PMO, with the assistance of \nthe consultants, will monitor and assess activities, and provide semiannual reports to ADB on the \nphysical implementation and financial aspects of the Project to ensure that its impact is monitored \nand reported in line with ADB requirements. \n \n9.  Governance and Anticorruption Measures \n \n46.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998), as amended to date was explained to and discussed \nwith NMG and the IAs, including the recent harmonized definitions of corrupt and fraudulent \npractices.23 ADB\u2019s approval of the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan was also \nindicated and discussed. The Project includes anticorruption and governance assurances in \nsupport  of  the  principles  of  transparency,  participation,  accountability,  zero-tolerance  for \ncorruption  (para.  28  of  the  RRP),  and  requirement  for  performance  audit.  As  part  of  its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations, the loan and project agreements, and \nthe bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project will include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of NMG and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders  as  they  relate  to  the  Project.  For  the  Project,  NMG  will  undertake  the  following \nanticorruption actions: (i) involve full-time officials from Nanjing Discipline Investigation Bureau in \nbidding and construction; (ii) introduce a dual-signing system, in which the civil works contract \nwinner also signs an anticorruption contract with the employer; and (iii) periodically inspect fund \nwithdrawals and settlements by the contractor.   \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n47.  In addition to joint project reviews carried out at least once a year, ADB, the JPG, and \nNMG will undertake a comprehensive midterm review one to 2 years after the start of project \nimplementation.  The  review  will  include  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope,  implementation \narrangements, resettlement, achievement of scheduled targets, and progress on the agenda for \npolicy  reform  and  capacity  building  measures.  Feedback  from  the  PPMS  activities  will  be \nanalyzed.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n48.  By 2010, the Project will benefit about 2.7 million urban residents in Nanjing whose living \nconditions and public health standards will improve as a result of (i) reduced pollution in Nanjing\u2019s \nsurface water following the improvement of wastewater collection and the wastewater treatment \nrate, better sludge management, and renewal of degraded urban wetland; (ii) protection from \nflooding and elimination of hazards associated with inadequate stormwater drainage; and (iii) \nreduction of the incidence of waterborne infectious diseases below the 2005/06 level of 43 cases \nper 1,000 people. By 2010, the Project will improve the management of surface water resources \nin Nanjing by (i) achieving the goal of 85% wastewater treatment rate in Nanjing; (ii) reducing the \nannual pollution load in the Qinhuai River by 5,000 tons biochemical oxygen demand, 9,000 tons \nchemical oxygen demand, 6,800 tons suspended solids, 950 tons ammonia nitrogen, and 110 \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2006. Anticorruption Policy: Harmonized Definitions of Corrupt and Fraudulent Practices. Manila. ", "15 \ntons  total  phosphorus; (iii)  significantly  reducing  flooding  in  urban  areas;  (iv)  increasing  the \nefficiency and management capacity of the IAs; and (v) improving cost recovery through a better \ntariff structure, with gradual increases to achieve cost recovery.  \n \n49.  To achieve national wastewater treatment targets, NMG will build a new WWTP. Upon \nproject completion, 100,000 m3/day treatment capacity will be added, and the four WWTPs will \nprovide a total of 1,145,000 m3/day secondary treatment to the received wastewater to reach \nlocal standards of an 85% wastewater treatment rate by 2010. The Project will help increase the \nwastewater treatment rate in the main city of Nanjing from 75% to 85% by 2010. Associated \nsewer networks and pumping stations will be built to accommodate the growth in wastewater \nflows to year 2015 in the project areas. The significant water quality improvements in the Qinhuai \nRiver and in turn in the Nanjing section of the YRB will contribute to integrated water resource \nmanagement and pollution control, basin management, and transboundary pollution prevention \nand control.  \n \n50.  The stormwater management component will add 27 km to the 1,153 km of storm drain \nand combined system. To enhance flood control in the urban areas of Nanjing, this component \nwill improve the drainage-sewerage network by separating stormwater and wastewater flows into \ndifferent systems and rehabilitating defective pipes. Waterborne diseases; accidents; injuries and \nloss of life; and damage to property, agriculture, and infrastructure will be minimized. \n \nB.  Social Dimensions \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n51.  Land acquisition and resettlement will involve people affected by (i) permanent acquisition \nof land for the wetland park, sludge disposal facility, and pumping stations; (ii) temporary use of \nland for rehabilitating river banks and installing trunk sewer pipelines; and (iii) demolition of \nhouses  or  buildings.  The  resettlement  requirements  have  been  carefully  considered  and \nincorporated  into  the  project  design.  Through  the  optimum  engineering  project  design,  the \nresettlement  impacts  were  minimized.  As  a  result,  only  one  of  the  components  will  have \nsignificant land acquisition and resettlement impacts.  \n \n52.  In total, the Project will require (i) the permanent acquisition of 63.5 hectares (ha), of \nwhich 33.5 ha is rural collective land; (ii) the temporary acquisition of 97.6 ha, of which 12 ha is \nclassified  as  rural  collective  land;  and  (iii)  the  demolition  of  50,899  square  meters  (m2)  of \nresidential housing and 48,895 m2 of enterprises and shops. Accordingly, 803 people will be \naffected, of which 339 will be affected by permanent land acquisition, and 455 residents and 272 \nstaff of enterprises and shops will be affected by house/building demolition. No indigenous people \nor  ethnic  minorities  will  be  adversely  affected  by  any  of  the  project  components.  The  cost \nestimate for land acquisition and resettlement is $50.45 million, equivalent to CNY409.09 million, \nincluding contingencies, taxes, and fees for resettlement administration. All the land acquisition \nand resettlement costs will be included in the project cost. \n \n53.  Individual resettlement plans were prepared for the five components in accordance with \nPRC Land Administration Law (1998), State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly \nEnforce  Land  Administration  (2004),  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995),  and \nassociated operational procedures. The resettlement plans provide a socioeconomic profile of the \npeople  affected  and  scope  of  impacts;  and  address  issues  related  to  their  entitlements  for \ncompensation,  legal  framework,  public  consultations,  grievance  procedures,  rehabilitation \nmeasures,  budget,  and  implementation  milestones.  The  summary  resettlement  plan  is  in \nAppendix 11. NMG and the IAs have implemented ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005), \n ", "16   \nwhich  requires  full  disclosure  for  the  resettlement  activities  by  (i)  distributing  copies  of  the \nresettlement information booklet to affected households and village offices on 1 September 2006, \n(ii) posting the draft resettlement plans in village offices or resident committees on 1 September \n2006, and (iii) posting English versions of the draft resettlement plans on the ADB website \nfollowing their endorsement by NMG and Environment and Social Safeguard Division (RSES) on \n26 September 2006.24 The final RPs were uploaded onto the ADB website on 13 November 2006. \n \n54.  All those affected will be compensated and resettled in a timely and adequate manner in \naccordance with the resettlement plans so that they will be at least as well off as they would have \nbeen  without  the  Project.  To  ensure  that  they  have  been  adequately  compensated  and \nrehabilitated, the PMO and IAs will (i) keep ADB informed of resettlement plan implementation \nthrough semiannual progress reports until resettlement is complete, and (ii) prepare resettlement \ncompletion reports and submit them to ADB.  \n \n2.  Resettlement Monitoring \n \n55.  ADB requires internal and external monitoring of the implementation of land acquisition \nand  resettlement  for  the  Project.  The  PMO  and  IAs  will  recruit  an  independent  agency  for \nsemiannual monitoring and annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 years \nafter the completion of land acquisition and resettlement. An international social specialist under \nconsulting services will help the PMO and IAs to facilitate internal monitoring and evaluation of \nresettlement, and prepare the progress reports. The monitors will conduct site visits, review \nresettlement progress, implement policy and income restoration for those affected, support the \ntraining programs, and make recommendations to resolve any issues. Monitoring and evaluation \nreports will be prepared and simultaneously submitted to ADB, PMO, and IAs. These reports will \nbe uploaded onto the ADB website. In addition to the electronic copies, the monitors will provide \nhard copies of the report (both in English and Chinese). ADB requires three English copies and \ntwo Chinese copies.  \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction \n \n56.  A poverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with ADB guidelines to collect \ndetailed social information to inform project design; and identify poverty reduction and social \ndevelopment  objectives,  outcomes,  and  indicators.  In  addition  to  the  socioeconomic  survey, \npublic consultations were conducted with different groups of stakeholders including consumer \ngroups, business communities, government agencies, people affected by the Project, and civil \nsociety organizations. A participatory approach was adopted for project design and will continue \nduring project implementation. The poverty and social analysis identified vulnerable groups and \nopportunities  for  pro-poor  interventions;  and  recommended  social  action  measures,  and \nparticipation  and  mitigation  plans  to  achieve  positive  social  benefits.  The  summary  poverty \nreduction and social development strategy is in Appendix 12.  \n \n57.  The Project will contribute to achieving Millennium Development Goal 7 and target 1025 \nthrough improved quality of life for approximately 2.7 million people by reducing the incidence of \nwaterborne diseases and flood risk in urban Nanjing, and providing employment opportunities \n                                                 \n24  RPs were prepared for all five components. Based on subsequent review by RSES, it was decided that only three \ncomponents  required  RPs,  since  two  components  had  no  impacts  on  people.  The  three  components  with \nresettlement impacts included the (i) Inner Qinhuai River Sewerage and Water Replenishment, (ii) City East \nWastewater Treatment Plant, and (iii) Sludge Treatment. These will be monitored for compliance with ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n25  This calls for halving, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and improved \nsanitation.  ", "17 \nduring construction and operation of project facilities, with anticipated flow on effects to economic \ndevelopment. The poor,26 who comprise 5% of total population, will disproportionately benefit \nfrom  the  Project  through  reductions  in  medical  costs  incurred  as  a  result  of  contracting \nwaterborne diseases valued at approximately CNY142 per person per year. Health benefits are \nexpected  to  be  felt  disproportionately  by  women,  who  are  more  vulnerable  to  waterborne \ndiseases due to higher contact with water from household responsibilities (especially cooking \nand washing), and are mainly responsible for care of the young and old when they are sick. A \nhealth impact analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n58.  The  Project  will  create  a  minimum  of  6,000  full-time  jobs  during  the  5  years  of \nconstruction. The poor and women will fill about 50% of these jobs. Those temporarily employed \nin construction will benefit from additional training and experience that will provide them with \nopportunities in future planned infrastructure projects. The associated wages for workers translate \nto CNY543 million of project costs that will return to the local economy. Project operations will \ncreate 450 full-time permanent jobs directly and another 710 jobs through multiplier effects, \ncorresponding  to  approximately  CNY42  million  in  wages  per  year.  The  Project  will  provide \nemployment opportunities to the floating population of migrant workers by assisting them to apply \nfor temporary residence registration. In addition, the Project will require that all IAs comply with \nnational and local labor laws and regulations for wages, and occupational and health safety. \n \nC.  Financial Aspects \n \n59.  The financial evaluation of the Project was undertaken in real terms using constant 2006 \nprices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were converted to \nreal terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation and currency \nfluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial position of the \nIAs under the with- and without- project scenarios. The financial internal rate of return for the \nProject  was  computed  on  an  after-tax  basis  of  6.20%,  which  compares  favorably  with  the \nweighted average cost of capital in real terms of 2.79%. The financial analysis and projections are \nin Appendix 13.  \n \n60.  The sensitivity analysis includes an examination of the risk that project costs will increase \nby 10%, or that revenues are delayed by 1 year; the resulting financial internal rates of return are \n4.60% and 5.95%, respectively. A verification of the local financing plan reveals that the equity \ncontributions from NMG are less than 1.5% of its annual revenue, indicating minimal risk. NMG \nhas the financial resources to guarantee the loan repayments, and has provided assurances that \nit accepts this risk. An affordability analysis, based on proposed tariffs and household income \ndata from the social survey, has been undertaken. Tariffs under the Project are considered \naffordable if the combined average water and wastewater charges are less than 5% of household \nincome. The estimated tariffs on this basis are affordable to the average household (2.5% of \nincome), and also affordable to the poorest 10% of households (less than 3.5%). NMG has a \npolicy measure to decrease the impact of tariff increases on poor families through the Minimum \nLiving Standard Scheme.27 In addition, the Project includes pro-poor assurances that will protect \nthe poor from wastewater tariff increases. The revenue-generating IA, NCIC, has agreed to \nminimum levels of financial performance, and these will be included as loan covenants covering \ncapital structure (debt to equity ratio), debt service coverage ratio, and liquidity ratio. Financial \nprojections estimate the tariffs required for an appropriate level of financial performance. Periodic \ntariff reviews will be required to overcome the risk of poor financial performance or of unexpected \nchanges in tariff income. The Project is considered both financially viable and sustainable.  \n \n                                                 \n26  The poverty line in Nanjing (urban) is CNY260 per capita per month. \n27  The households eligible for the Minimum Living Standard Scheme are cushioned from the increases in the cost of \nessential public services via a subsidy. In 2004, eligible families received CNY5 per month for 1 year to reflect \nincreased water tariffs, and in 2005 received CNY70 as cushion for another increase in water tariffs.  \n ", "18   \nD.  Economic Aspects \n \n61.  The  Project  is  an  integral  part  of  the  ongoing  provincial,  municipal,  and  river  basin \nenvironmental programs, contributing significantly to pollution control in the Qinhuai River and in \nturn to the environmental protection of the YRB. Public perceptions and preferences were also \nevaluated  using  household  and  business  surveys.  The  analysis  demonstrate  that,  when \ncompared with a range of other public services, wastewater management, waterborne disease \nprevention, river cleaning, and flood damage control improvements rank highest in priority. A \nquantitative  economic  analysis  also  demonstrates  the  value  of  the  Project.  The  economic \nanalysis was conducted for 25 years including project construction, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Project benefits and costs were estimated on a \nwith- and without- project basis. Costs were divided into tradable and nontradable costs, and \nbenefits  were  adjusted  to  account  for  nonincremental  and  incremental  benefits.  Incremental \neconomic benefits were valued on the basis of willingness to pay; and in the case of flood \nprevention, the damages avoided. The economic internal rate of return for the components \nranges from 15.1% to 28.2%, and for the whole Project 21.6%, which exceeds the economic \nopportunity cost of capital, assumed at 12%. The economic analysis is in Appendix 14.  \n \nE.  Environmental Aspects \n \n62.  Extensive  public  consultations  involving  meetings  with  stakeholders,  focus  group \ndiscussions,  and  surveys  were  undertaken  twice  during  preparation  of  the  domestic \nenvironmental  impact  assessments  (EIAs).  The  EIA  summarizes  the  environmental  impacts, \nmitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  plans.  The  environmental  management  plan  (EMP), \nprepared as part of the EIA, will guide environmental mitigation and monitoring under the Project. \nThe summary EIA was circulated to the ADB Board and posted on the ADB website on 3 August \n2006. The Project will improve the urban environment and surface water quality in Nanjing and in \nthe YRB. A major positive impact and environmental benefit is pollutant reduction (para. 48 of the \nRRP).  The  project  preparatory  TA  consultants,  based  on  detailed  assessment,  proposed \ninnovative value-added engineering solutions (Supplementary Appendix F), which have been \ndiscussed with the design institutes for consideration and incorporation into the feasibility study \nreports. \n \n63.  The  stormwater  component  will  bring  the  stormwater  network  up-to-date  to  provide \nadequate capacity for flood control. The river improvement and replenishment component, by \nimproving the flushing capacity of the watercourses, will improve the water quality and flood \nstorage  capacity  in  these  rivers.  The  sludge  management  component  will  provide  proper \ntreatment and disposal for sewage sludge from five WWTPs, dredged materials from the rivers, \nand sludge from maintenance of the pipeline network. This will prevent secondary pollution of the \nNanjing environment. The wetland park subcomponent will remove a degraded urban site from \nthe city, and restore it into a wetland park with functions for outdoor recreation, water quality \npolishing,  flood  storage,  wildlife  habitats,  and  conservation  education.  All  these  will  bring \nsecondary public health and socioeconomic benefits to Nanjing and its citizens. Improvements of \nthe water quality and the riverbanks will improve the living conditions of people along these rivers, \nbeautify the culturally important Qinhuai River, and promote tourism and property development \nthat  will  bring  employment  and  other  socioeconomic  benefits.  The  Project  will  have  an \noverwhelming positive environmental impact, and any environmental risks during construction \nand the life of the Project will be mitigated by implementing the measures identified by the EIA \nand the environmental management plan.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n64.  Potential institutional, financial, and policy risks related to the Project include failure of \nNMG to (i) implement institutional strengthening for effective project management, (ii) increase \nwater and wastewater tariffs to meet cost-recovery targets, and (iii) meet the equity requirements ", "19 \nto implement the Project. These risks have been mitigated by (i) obtaining assurances from JPG \nand NMG on the financial and managerial autonomy of the IAs, and institutional strengthening of \nthe IAs; (ii) periodic water tariff reviews and adjustments following the national guidelines; and (iii) \nassurances from JPG and NMG that guarantee provision of counterpart funding for construction \nand O&M of the non-revenue generating project components. ADB review missions will monitor \ncompliance  with  the  financial  and  operational  covenants  to  ensure  the  IAs  are  financially \nsustainable. The Project does not have any unusual technical risks. The stormwater, wastewater, \nand sludge management subcomponents under the Project use conventional engineering design \nand treatment processes that are robust and have proven records of reliable performance. The \nequipment packages to be procured through ICB will include technical support for installing, \ntesting,  and  commissioning  mechanical  and  electrical  plant  as  recommended  by  the \nmanufacturer.  Given  the  performance  of  ADB\u2019s  PRC  portfolio,  cost  overruns  and  major \nimplementation delays are not expected. Further, other risks including corruption and impact on \nthe affordability of the very poor from rapid wastewater tariff increases are mitigated through \nappropriate assurances. Regarding affordability, subsidies provided by NMG under its Minimum \nLiving Standard Scheme for the poor will also be a significant mitigating factor.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n65.  In  addition to  the  standard  assurances,28 the  Government  and  NMG  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  NMG will ensure that the wastewater fees charged are set at a level that ensures \nfull cost recovery of O&M, depreciation and financial costs including debt service \nobligations, and a reasonable profit margin for wastewater treatment.  \n \n(ii)  NMG will ensure that prior to the implementation of any tariff increases, Nanjing \nMunicipal Price Bureau will (a) review and conduct research to determine the \nnumber of poor people, including those living at or below the poverty line, who \nwould be affected by such tariff increase, and the impact of such wastewater \nadjustments on the poor; (b) prepare a plan or scheme to be provided to ADB for \nreview, which may include price subsidies or other measures such as lifeline \ntariffs, to ensure that the livelihood or standard of living of the people affected \nallows them to be at least as well-off as before the tariff increase; (c) issue a \ndecree before such tariff increase takes effect to ensure that all those affected are \nprovided  such  subsidy  or  measures;  and  (d)  monitor  the  effectiveness  of  the \nsubsidy or other measures.  \n \n(iii)  In furtherance of the principles of transparency, participation, accountability, and \nzero-tolerance for corruption, NMG will establish a project website to provide the \npublic with information on the Project  including (a) a summary of the audited \nfinancial statements of the Project, (b) tracking of procurement contract awards, (c) \nany  proposed  tariff  increases  and  associated  scheduled  public  hearings,  (d) \nrelevant  laws  and  regulations,  and  (e)  any  information  relating  to  pro-poor \nsubsidies or lifeline tariffs. NMG will periodically make such information available \non radio and in newspapers.  \n \n(iv)  NMG  shall  ensure  that  qualified  and  independent  auditors  shall  conduct \nperformance/\u2018\u2019value for money\u2019\u2019 audits during project implementation to determine \nthe degree to which Project funds have been effectively and efficiently utilized to \nimplement the Project, and achieve its objectives, outcomes and its performance \nindicators. Such performance audits may be conducted together with the financial \n                                                 \n28  The full list of assurances is included in the Loan Agreement and Project Agreement.  \n ", "20   \naudit as part of the overall annual project audit, in accordance with the applicable \nGovernment\u2019s audit law, regulations and policy.  \n \nVI.

Increased municipal and industrial wastewater has become a major contributor to river \nand lake pollution in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Surface and groundwater sources \nfor urban water supply are frequently polluted to unacceptable levels. An important strategy in \nthe Government\u2019s plan to control and reduce pollution is to focus on river basin activities, \nespecially in the management of surface water quality. Currently Nanjing City has treatment \nworks  capacity  in  excess  of  60%  of  the  municipal  wastewater  (domestic  and  industrial) \ngenerated. The proportion of domestic wastewater is set to increase marginally as a result of \nincreasing urbanization, reduced urban density, and improved efficiency in water use on the part \nof PRC industries. Government policy now requires that cost-recovery tariffs be adopted for the \nprovision  of  wastewater  treatment.  In  contrast,  flood  control  and  stormwater  drainage  is \nconsidered a non-revenue-generating activity, to be financed from local government revenues.  \n \nA.  Basin Focus \n \n2.  This sector analysis is conducted in a river basin context. The water policy1 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) calls for ADB to support integrated water resource management; in \nthis  context,  coordinated  river  basin  activities  to  manage  surface  water  quality.  A  sector \nperspective for the Project must relate to basin plans to manage surface water quality, evaluate \nplan implementation, and assess progress in managing water quality. Nanjing is located in the \nlower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (YRB), the largest river basin in the PRC covering a \nlarge part of the country. The Yangtze River is about 6,380 kilometers (km) long with a drainage \nbasin of 1.2 million square kilometers (km2). The main trunk of the Yangtze flows in an easterly \ndirection and eventually enters the East China Sea at Shanghai.  \n \n3.  The YRB Commission, which the central Government established to manage YRB water \nresources,  prepared  the  Yangtze  River  Water  Resources  Protection  Plan  (2002),  which \nprovides  a  broad  framework  for  managing  YRB  water  resources.  In  April  2005,  the  YRB \nCommission sponsored the First Yangtze Forum in Wuhan. The forum issued a formal Yangtze \nDeclaration  on  Protection  and  Development,  which  calls  \u201c\u2026for  active  participation  of  all \nstakeholders in collaborative efforts to concurrently protect and develop the Yangtze River and \nensure a healthy Yangtze for our future generations.\u201d The declaration highlights the importance \nof integrated river basin management.  \n \nB.  Country Strategy and Program \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (CSPU)2 for the PRC aims to promote \ncontinued  economic  growth  in  the  country  as  a  primary  means  of  reducing  poverty.  It \nrecognizes,  however,  that  the  PRC\u2019s  economic  growth  has  come  at  the  cost  of  serious \nenvironmental  degradation,  particularly  increased  water  and  air  pollution.  Environmental \ndegradation threatens the prospect of sustaining the economic growth. Improving environmental \nprotection is therefore a main strategic issue and one of the main thematic priorities of the \nCSPU. A complementary objective and a main focus of the CSPU is promoting the provision of \nadequate  urban  infrastructure  to  improve  the  livelihood  of  the  rapidly  increasing  urban \npopulation.  The  Project  is  fully  consistent  with  the  CSPU,  which  calls  for  market-oriented \nreforms and attention to urban environmental problems. The market-oriented reforms include \nthe principle of cost recovery through user charges, which is an important feature of the Project.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Manila. \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nC.  Nanjing Water Environment Improvement \n \n5.   In 2004, Nanjing Municipal Public Utilities Bureau arranged the preparation of a study \nand report: Nanjing City Water Environment Improvement Works Construction. This planning \ndocument contains medium-term targets to improve the quality of water bodies in and around \nNanjing City given national legislation, guidelines on water quality, and the situation within \nNanjing.  After  extensive  consultations  with  all  key  stakeholders,  the  Nanjing  municipal \ngovernment (NMG) approved the planning document in early 2005; it has become the official \nguide for the planning and design of environmental improvement projects in Nanjing. In addition, \ntwo other documents provide supplementary targets: Flood Control Planning for Qinhuai River \nBasin, and Jiangsu Province Surface Water (Environment) Beneficial Use Classification. \n \n6.  The planning targets for major water bodies, flood control, and wastewater treatment are \nsummarized as follows: \n \n(i)  water quality of major rivers and lakes in Jiangsu: from worse than class V to class \nV in 2007, and improved to class IV in 2010; \n(ii)  flood frequency of major tributaries of the Qinhuai River reduced to 1 in 100 years; \n(iii)  local flooding frequency: from less than 1 in 1 year to 1 in 2 years; and    \n(iv)  wastewater treatment rate increased to 85% for major cities like Nanjing. \n \nD.  Nanjing Municipality and Qinhuai River Basin Flood Control Planning \n \n7.  In  terms  of  river  drainage,  the  Outer  Qinhuai  River  is  a  right-bank  tributary  of  the \nYangtze River, originating at Lishui and Jurong conurbations. It is known as the Outer Qinhuai \nRiver because it lies outside the ancient city wall surrounding Nanjing City. The Outer Qinhuai \nRiver flows toward the Nanjing urban area via Dongshan town of Jiangning District. Its total \nlength is 110 km and the catchment area is 2,631 km2. Niushoushan, South, Xiangshui, Youyi, \nYunliang, and Yuntaishan rivers join it on its path to the confluence of the Yangtze River at San \nCha gate. Much of the city sits below the 100-year flood level of the Yangtze River predicted as \n10.63 meters above datum and is therefore subject to flooding during the rainy season (April to \nSeptember).   \n \n8.  The lower 34 km of the river lies within Nanjing\u2019s main urban districts. Water quality in \nthe  lower  Qinhuai  River  has  deteriorated  significantly  in  the  past  15  years  mainly  due  to \nwastewater discharge from the city, and currently fails to achieve class V of the PRC water \nquality standards. All seven rivers and three lakes in the Nanjing built-up area are polluted. The \nmunicipality is served by a mixture of wastewater, stormwater, and combined sewer networks. \nDue  to  lack  of  sufficient  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  facilities,  increasingly  severe \nproblems related to water pollution and urban drainage have resulted in serious water quality \nproblems  in  the  Qinhuai  River  within  Nanjing.  When  the  wastewater  interception  and \nwastewater treatment facilities under this Project are complete, Qinhuai River water quality is \nexpected to be improved from below class V to class IV in line with the planning targets. \n \n9.  The  main  problems  with  Nanjing\u2019s  stormwater  drainage  system  are  (i)  continuing \nurbanization  and  new  developments  in  the  limited  open  space  remaining  within  already \ncongested  areas,  (ii)  inadequate  network  coverage,  (iii)  old  infrastructure  with  inadequate \ndesign standards, (iv) limitations of the combined drainage systems leading to wastewater \noverflows during storm and flood events, and (v) inadequate maintenance of the drainage \nnetwork.  The  Project  addresses  these  issues  by  providing  storm-drain  network  extensions \ndesigned to new standards, and achieving better separation of the storm and sewage networks.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \nE.  Nanjing Municipality: Wastewater \n \n10.  The key references for the master planning of wastewater infrastructure in Nanjing are (i) \nNanjing City Water Environment Improvement Works Construction Planning (para. 5) (2004) \nand Nanjing City Trunk Sewers Planning (2005). These two wastewater master plans define the \nwastewater  catchment  boundaries,  the  strategic  locations  of  wastewater  treatment  works, \ndesign assumptions, layout, and sizes of major sewers for Nanjing City. \n \n11.  In 2004, industrial sources were responsible for 52% of the 2.46 million cubic meters per \nday (m3/day) of wastewater produced by greater Nanjing. Nanjing Main City generated about \n1.34 million m3/day of wastewater, including 0.17 million m3/day of industrial wastewater. Within \nNanjing Main City, the four existing wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have capacity to \ntreat about 70% of the domestic wastewater. NMG is currently implementing its wastewater \nmaster plan and will install additional WWTPs to raise the wastewater treatment rate to the \nrequired 85% target by 2010 as required by the state guidelines. The wastewater master plan \nincludes phased and well-coordinated construction of WWTPs and sewer networks using local \nfunds and assistance from ADB and other sources. To ensure that the WWTPs\u2019 expanded \ncapacity is fully utilized, sewers leading to the WWTPs must be constructed and in service \nbefore 2010.  \n \n12.  The  wastewater  interception  works,  additional  sewerage  network,  and  additional \ntreatment capacity to be provided under the Project will reduce the pollution load discharged \ninto the Qinhuai tributaries, and this in turn reduces pollution in the Qinhuai River itself as well \nas the Yangtze River, thus contributing to achievement of river quality targets. \n \nF.  Conclusions  \n \n13.  Nanjing municipality has a well-constructed set of policies, targets, and plans for the \nwastewater and drainage sector. These instruments are themselves compatible with national \npolicies and regulations. The relevant Nanjing sector plans are compatible with the overall \ndevelopment plan for the city and with the YRB water resources protection plan. The Project is \n \npart of the ongoing implementation of existing sector plans.\n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nPOLICY DIALOGUE \n \nA.  Overall Policy Framework  \n \n1.  Discussions with the Nanjing project management office (PMO) and relevant municipal \nagencies, and reference to specific national policy documents of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), reveal government policies in support of the Project and the establishment of institutional \narrangements for project sustainability. These policies include (i) corporatization, instead of direct \ngovernment provision, of public services; (ii) Government\u2019s role as enabler and regulator of \nservices; (iii) separation between government and enterprise management; (iv) financing of utility \nservices from user charges, with tariffs set in accordance with full cost-recovery principles; (v) \njoint  billing  of  water  and  wastewater  charges  under  the  \u201cone  bill,  two  items\u201d  system; \n(vi) encouragement of appropriate competition and private sector participation for investment in \ninfrastructure construction and operation and maintenance; (vii) adoption of the polluter pays \nprinciple; and (viii) promotion of social stability through poverty reduction and equal opportunities. \n \nB.  Cost Recovery and Tariff Reform \n \n2.  The  Project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  ongoing  economic  and  enterprise  reform \nprograms that require all wastewater management projects to be financially sustainable and \ncapable  of  cost  recovery.  Drainage  companies  are  required  to  improve  their  cost-recovery \ncapability. Appropriate mechanisms for tariff setting are a critical factor in attracting the needed \ninvestment in the sector, ending drainage companies\u2019 reliance on government subsidies, and \nproviding incentives to users to conserve water resources. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is \nactively encouraging this transition in its policy dialogue and lending operations. \n \n3.  ADB has funded two water tariff studies and one wastewater tariff study in support of the \nGovernment\u2019s initiatives. The National Guidelines on Water Tariffs, prepared during the first water \ntariff study,1 were promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission and the \nMinistry of Construction in September 1998. Major features in the guidelines that reflect specific \ntechnical assistance (TA) recommendations include (i) selecting a tariff structure based on local \nconditions and priorities; (ii) adopting full cost recovery as the main objective in setting and \napproving tariffs; (iii) using public hearings to disseminate tariff increase plans to the public and \nobtain their feedback; (iv) adopting a simplified process for tariff regulation, requiring evaluation \nand approval by the municipal government, and supported by provincial and national review and \nmonitoring; and (v) introducing lifeline tariffs for the poor. The guidelines improved the long-term \nfinancial viability of water supply companies and provided for operation and maintenance and \nservice expansion to help increase private sector participation in the water and wastewater sector. \nNMG confirmed implementation of the guidelines. ADB\u2019s wastewater tariff study TA,2 carried out \nbetween 2002 and 2003, contributed to wastewater tariff reform. Circular 1,192 of September \n1999, amending the policy guidance on wastewater tariff setting, requires wastewater tariffs to be \nbased on the principle of cost recovery but allows local governments flexibility in deciding when to \nimplement the circular. NMG has been increasing water and wastewater tariffs in keeping with the \nstate policy. Stormwater and sludge management, and river improvement are, however, viewed \nas a non-revenue-generating activity in the PRC.  \n \n4.   The  project  financial  analysis  assumes  that  the  wastewater  tariffs  are  based  on  the \nprinciple  of  full  cost  recovery.  Wastewater  tariffs  levied  in  the  main  urban  area  of  Nanjing \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Water Supply Tariff Study. Manila. \n2  ADB.  2001.

Manila. \n ", "  Appendix 3  31 \n(currently CNY1.05 per cubic meter [m3]) are already higher than those in other cities in the PRC. \nAfter conducting a cost audit of the current and projected water, wastewater, and water resource \nexpenses, Nanjing Price Bureau proposes to increase the average wastewater tariff in Nanjing \nfrom the current CNY1.05/m3, to CNY1.40/m3 by 2006, and CNY1.60/m3 by 2010, exceeding the \nestimated full cost-recovery requirements of CNY1.57/m3 in 2010. These water and wastewater \ntariff increases, initiated through extensive consultation by the Nanjing Price Bureau, are highly \nencouraging and will contribute significantly to financial sustainability of the water and wastewater \ncompanies. In Nanjing, the local water supply company collects water and wastewater tariffs \nthrough the \u201cone bill, two items\u201d approach, which has been shown in other countries to be the \nmost effective way of collecting wastewater charges. Improved public awareness of the benefits \nof  effective  wastewater  drainage  and  treatment  can  make  them  much  more  willing  to  pay \nwastewater charges. Socioeconomic surveys done during the project preparatory TA indicate a \nsignificantly high public willingness to pay, which is a very positive indicator of public support for \nthe proposed project investments.  \n \nC.  Private Sector Participation \n \n5.  The Project will demonstrate ADB\u2019s comprehensive approach to addressing wastewater \ninfrastructure needs, through its public and private sector operations. Implementation of the \nPrivate Sector Operations Department advisory TA3 in Nanjing, and the subsequent processing of \nthe Nanjing Water Utility Development Project (NWUDP) is proceeding in parallel with the Nanjing \nQinhuai River Environmental Improvement Project. The proposed assistance for the NWUDP is a \npartial credit guarantee for up to 50% of a CNY2 billion bond issue (with a duration of up to 15 \nyears) by Nanjing Public Utilities Company, a subsidiary of Nanjing Construction Investment \nCompany, which is the implementing agency for the wastewater treatment component under the \nproposed  Project.  While  the  NWUDP  and  the  proposed  Project  are  autonomous  and  not \ndependent  on  each  other,  significant  synergies  have  been  derived  from  the  public-private \napproach to addressing water pollution and improving the urban environment in Nanjing. The \nsuccessful policy dialogue on wastewater tariff reforms and the rigorous safeguards assessment \nfor compliance undertaken through the proposed Project will support the NWUDP. Further, the \nprocessing and approval of the proposed Project will act as a catalyst for the NWUDP and further \nprivate sector initiatives. If the NWUDP is successful, it will through the guarantee of the bond \nissue ensure that the water utilities in the PRC have access to private sector funds to finance the \nenormous demand for water and wastewater infrastructure expenditures. The bond issue will also \npromote international standards of accounting, corporate governance, and public disclosure. The \nestimated timetable for the NWUDP is (i) due diligence in November 2006, (ii) Credit Committee \nmeeting in December 2006, and (iii) Board consideration in the first quarter of 2007. \n \nD.  Water Quality in the Yangtze and Qinhuai River Basins \n \n6.  The Yangtze River basin (YRB) is the largest river basin in the PRC. The Changjiang \nWater Resources Commission, with overall responsibility for managing water resources within the \nYRB, has developed a basin management plan with a framework for managing YRB water \nresources. The plan cites the deteriorating water quality of the Yangtze River. Though the river is \noften seen as having high assimilative capacity, the cumulative effect of the numerous point and \nnonpoint discharges is deteriorating its water quality. Effects are felt throughout the downstream \nreaches and the East China Sea. The plan sets out several general pollution control targets with \nspecific targets to be developed by individual provinces and cities.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Nanjing Water Utility Long-Term Capital \nFinance in Commercial Markets. Manila. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \n7.  The Qinhuai River flows through the urban area before it joins the Yangtze River. The \nofficial water quality target for the lower Qinhuai River is class V, but currently the river fails to \nachieve that target by a significant margin. When the Project is completed, the river water quality \nwill be improved to class IV. City East WWTP expansion alone will reduce chemical oxygen \ndemand discharge by more than 90,000 tons per year once fully operational. This component \ntogether with others within this Project and being undertaken separately by NMG will contribute \nsignificantly to pollution control in the YRB. In addition, the ADB-funded Wuhan Wastewater \nManagement Project (2003) and Wuhan Wastewater and Stormwater Management Project (June \n2006) will contribute to pollution control in the YRB; as does the successfully completed ADB-\nsupported Suzhou Creek Rehabilitation Project.  \n \nE.  Regulatory Enforcement and Monitoring for Environmental Management \n \n8.  To build the necessary capacity for sound environmental management and strengthen the \nlegal  framework,  ADB  helped  train  staff  of  the  Environment  Protection  Commission,  and  is \nassisting in drafting and revising some of the PRC\u2019s environmental laws.4 ADB is helping to \npromote a more effective legal and regulatory framework for environmental protection in light of \nthe PRC\u2019s transition to a market economy and its adherence to international environmental \nprotection agreements. ADB helped to upgrade the knowledge and skills of provincial legislative \ndrafters in the review, amendment, and formulation of local legislation related to the protection \nand  conservation  of  the  environment  and  natural  resources.5 In  addition,  ADB  provided \nassistance in environmental management by improving the institutional capacity of the State \nEnvironment Protection Administration, and the local and provincial environmental protection \nbureaus to strengthen environmental standards and enforce environmental laws and policies.6 \n \n9.  The Jiangsu Provincial Government and NMG have acknowledged their responsibilities to \nensure that commitments given in the environmental impact assessment documentation are \nadhered  to  during  project  implementation.  This  responsibility  will  be  discharged  by  the \nimplementing  agencies  in  conjunction  with  relevant  NMG  departments  and  a  specific  staff \nmember will be designated to undertake a monitoring and coordination role. Establishment of \nappropriate monitoring procedures will be included in the implementation consulting services \ncontract. \n \nF.  Wastewater Management and Urban Environmental Improvement \n \n10.  Policy  dialogue  on  wastewater  management  focuses  on  integrated  management  of \nindustrial and domestic wastewater including on-site treatment and public sewer connections. \nADB  has  supported  the  Government's  policies  for  wastewater  management  by  providing  a \nnumber of related environmental loans that include wastewater treatment components in Beijing, \nChaohu, Chengde, Fuzhou, Hefei, Qingdao, Shanghai, Tangshan, Tianjin, Wuhan, Changchun \nand along the Hai River system. The importance of wastewater treatment was also addressed \nunder  the  Urban  Environmental  Improvement  Planning  Study7 that  strengthened  institutions \nresponsible  for  environmental  improvement  in  a  number  of  cities,  and  identified  future \ninfrastructure requirements. The national guidelines drafted under the Urban Wastewater Tariffs \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

These ADB projects and related initiatives provide a solid \nbasis for ongoing policy dialogue in wastewater management.  \n \n11.  Discussions were held with NMG on the need to identify overall investment plans for the \nsector that will be in line with Nanjing\u2019s urban development and wastewater master plans. The \nincremental wastewater treatment capacity that will be added will exceed the incremental water \nsupply in the project area.  \n \n12.  NMG  has  almost  completed  its  major  investment  in  the  lower  reaches  of  the  Outer \nQinhuai River and provided both flood protection and riverine parkland. In conjunction with this is \na stated policy to improve the urban environment within the Inner Qinhuai River system through \nwater replenishment and dredging in accordance with the short-term construction plan for Nanjing \nCity main town water environment improvement. \n \nG.  Flood and Stormwater Drainage Management: \n \n13.  The Project includes works to improve the upper reaches of the Qinhuai River (Yunliang \nconfluence to Xibei village) to bring the existing embankments in line with national standards and \nprovide flood protection levels as set out in Flood Control Planning for Qinhuai River Basin. \nSimilar work is proposed for the South River to bring its service level in line with the city standard \nof flood protection for rivers of 1/100 year flood return event. \n \n14.  The existing stormwater drainage pipelines for Nanjing City (inclusive of the pipelines of \nthe combined system) total 1,153.4 km. Since reconstruction has not been carried out in the \nwhole zone, some built-up areas cannot meet the flood protection standard, and the pipe network \nis not yet complete. Some regions have below standard infrastructure, undersized pipes, and \ninadequate outlet arrangements. Some urban areas still have the combined system of sewage \nand rainwater. In many areas rainwater is drained through open channels; overflows result in \nserious river pollution. Therefore, reconstructing the stormwater drainage pipelines, upgrading the \nsystem standard, and thereby preventing further flooding problems are required. \n \n15.  One of the prime objectives of the Project is to improve stormwater drainage management \nin urban areas of Nanjing and to alleviate localized urban flooding due to the high intensity of \nrainfall during the short rainy season of June to August. NMG has prepared and approved a \nwastewater master plan and water environmental improvement plans that provide a strategy for \nseparating wastewater and stormwater drainage. The proposed stormwater drainage pipeline \nworks accords with the overall objectives of the water environment improvement determined in \nthe short-term construction plan for Nanjing City main town water environment improvement. \nCompletion of separation systems will help reduce the health risks created by urban flooding and \nalso protect the WWTPs from hydraulic overload. \n \nH.  Urban Parkland Development Strategy \n \n16.  NMG\u2019s urban greening policy seeks to ensure a prescribed proportion of the developed \nurban  area  is  urban  parkland  or  areas  under  some  form  of  plant  cultivation.  This  was \ndemonstrated  by  previous  projects,  which  established  a  riverine  park  along  12.5  km  of  the \nQinhuai River corridor through Nanjing City. Under the proposed Project, a 33 hectare (ha) park \n(Yunliang River park) at the confluence of the Yunliang and Outer Qinhuai rivers is proposed with \ndesign themes for recreation and conservation education. This park will meet the urgent need to \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nincrease green space in Nanjing City. By reducing impermeable areas, stormwater runoff is \nreduced as well. \n \nI.  Sludge Management Strategy \n \n17.  Policy dialogue on sludge management focuses on integrated management of sludge \ngenerated from water treatment plants, wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), and municipal \nsludge comprising river dredging and cleansing of drainage pipelines. NMG recognizes that \nprovision of increased water supply leads to an increase in the volume of wastewater generated \nand consequently an increase in sludge produced from both water treatment plants and WWTPs. \nProvision of adequate sludge handling, treatment, and disposal facilities is essential to public \nhealth. This must be taken in phases because of high costs involved. The success of sludge \nmanagement policy will impact the sector objective of secondary pollution reduction and also the \ncost-effectiveness of sludge management and operation. An overall sludge management strategy \nincluding an action plan will be prepared as part of the Project.  \n \nJ.  Corporate Governance and Enterprise Reform \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s urban infrastructure projects are aimed to address various aspects of corporate \ngovernance reform: (i) structuring the utility companies along commercial lines, (ii) assisting these \nutilities to prepare business plans, (iii) strengthening the operation of the boards of directors for \nthe companies, and (iv) implementing external and internal audit arrangements.

NCIC  received  capacity-building  assistance,  including \ninstitutional  and  financial  management  strengthening,  and  accounting  system  strenthening \nunder  the  advisory  TA,  Nanjing  Water  Utility  Long-Term  Capital  Finance  in  Commercial \n ", "Appendix 8       43 \nMarkets. NCIC is improving its oversight and control of operations through capacity building and \nADB\u2019s own supervision of the Project. NCIC is competent in project implementation but will \nbenefit from assistance in certain aspects of wastewater operations, such as the management \nof sewer connections, detection and prevention of water inflow and infiltration into wastewater \ncollectors, and sludge management.  \n \n7.  Future Financial Performance. Consolidated pro-forma financial statements for NCIC \nare given in Supplementary Appendix G. The cost-recovery ratio exceeds 1.0 throughout the \nprojection period and a debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 can be reached by 2012. These are \nsatisfactory results. The planned increase of wastewater traiffs from the current CNY1.05/m3, to \nCNY1.40/m3 by December 2006, and CNY1.60/m3 by 2010, exceeding the estimated full cost-\nrecovery  requirements  of  CNY1.57/m3  in  2010,  will  contribute  significantly  to  the  financial \nsustainability of NCIC and the Project.  \n  \nB.  Nanjing Municipal Engineering Construction Department  \n \n8.  Nanjing Municipal Engineering Construction Department (NMECD) is the IA for three \ncomponents: (i) Inner Qinhuai River sewerage and water replenishment; (ii) North He Xi District \nsewerage, river improvement, and water replenishment; and (iii) sludge treatment and disposal. \nNMECD is a government agency that implements public sector construction projects that are \nnot commercially viable. \n \n9.  Construction  Project  Management  Capacity.  NMECD\u2019s  main  responsibility  is  to \ncontruct and recontruct municipal infrastructure including roads and bridges, lake and river \nenvironmental improvement, water replenishment schemes, and wastewater networks. NMECD \nhas successfully completed construction of projects for a total of CNY3.0 billion.    \n \n10.  Operational Management Capacity. NMECD will not be involved in future operation \nand maintenance. The new assets, once commissioned, will be handed over to the Municipal \nFacilities Management Department of the Municpal Public Utilities Bureau, which is responsible \nfor providing operation and mainatenance for these facilities.  \n \n11.  Financial Management Capacity. Overall, the financial management arrangements of \nNMECD are satisfactory and can be relied on to support effective project management. Key \nfeatures  of  the  current  arrangements  are  (i)  use  of  an  accrual  basis  of  accounting  and \nadherence to relevant national accounting standards, (ii) use of appropriate internal controls, \n(iii)  adequately trained and qualified staff, (iv) use of computerized accounting records, and \n(v) use  of  internal  auditors  reporting  to  the  NMECD  director  general.  Current  audit \narrangements,  including  internal  audit  and  external  government  audit,  meet  ADB\u2019s  audit \nrequirements. NMECD staff will be trained in ADB loan processing policies and procedures. \n \n12.  Capacity-Building  Support.  The  capacity-building  initiatives  for  NMECD  under  the \nProject will focus on (i) training in relevant ADB project funding procedures; and (ii) review of \norganizational structure, operation, and maintenance to identify ways to improve efficiency. \n \n13.  Future Financial Performance. NMECD is is a non-revenue-generating legal entity and \na government department within Nanjing Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. NMG provides the \nfunds for constructing the approved projects; the service is funded from the local government \nbudget. Annual operation and maintenance costs for the Project are much less than 1% of \ngovernment revenues. Funding has therefore been generally adequate and should continue to \nbe adequate to assure sustainable benefits from project improvements.  \n   ", "44  Appendix 8 \nC.  Nanjing Drainage Management Department  \n \n14.  Nanjing  Drainage  Management  Department  (NDMD)  is  the  IA  for  the  stormwater \ndrainage component.  \n \n15.  Construction  Project  Management  Capacity. NDMD\u2019s main responsibilities are to \nconstruct drainage engineering works, and operate and maintain drainage facilities and flood \npumping stations within Nanjing. NDMD has considerable expertise in drainage engineering, \nmaintenance of drainage networks including puming stations, and water and effluents testing. \n \n16.  Operational  Management  Capacity. Currently, NDMD\u2019s Network Management Unit \nmaintains 193 km of sewers (of 1,100 km in Nanjing), 495 km of combined storm drains (of \n1,700  km  in  Nanjing),  and  28  km  of  intercepting  channels.  Its  experience  is  adequate  to \nmaintain the additional stormwater network.  \n \n17.  Financial Management Capacity. Overall, the financial management arrangements of \nNDMD are satisfactory and can be relied on to support effective project management. Key \nfeatures  of  the  current  arrangements  are  (i)  use  of  an  accrual  basis  of  accounting  and \nadherence to relevant national accounting standards, (ii) use of appropriate internal controls, \n(iii)  adequately trained and qualified staff, (iv) use of computerized accounting records, and \n(v) use of internal auditors reporting to the NDMD director general. Current audit arrangements, \nincluding internal audit and external government audit, meet ADB\u2019s audit requirements. NDMD \nstaff will be trained in ADB loan processing policies and procedures. \n \n18.  Capacity-Building  Support.  The  capacity-building  initiatives  for  NDMD  under  the \nProject will focus on (i) training in relevant ADB project funding procedures; and (ii) review of \norganizational structure, and operations and maintenance to identify ways to improve efficiency. \n \n19.  Future Financial Performance. NDMD is a non-revenue-generating legal entity and a \ngovernment department within Nanjing Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. NMG provides the \nfunds for constructing approved projects. The service is funded from the local government \nbudget. Annual operation and maintenance costs for the Project are much less than 1% of \ngovernment revenues. Funding has therefore been generally adequate and should continue to \nbe adequate to assure sustainable benefits from project improvements.  \n \nD.  Conclusion  \n \n20.  The assessment of sustainability covers both the construction and operational phases of \nthe Project and considers financial and managerial capabilities. In light of the resources and \nexperience of the IAs and the arrangements planned for project construction and operation, the \nProject is considered likely to be sustainable. Certain deficiencies and risks have been identified \nand  mitigation  measures  for  these  are  in  place  or  are  proposed  in  the  form  of  project \nassurances  and  provisions  for  capacity  building.  The  tariff  reforms  undertaken  by  NMG, \nincluding the generation of project construction funds ($20.0 million) directly from wastewater \ntariffs, will contribute significantly to project sustainability. Further, the tariff reforms (para. 7) \ndemonstrate that NMG is highly progressive in adopting tariff reforms. \n \n ", "   \nIMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE \n \nComponents  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011 \n   1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4 \nInner Qinhuai River Sewerage and Water Replenishment Component                                                 \nA.

The  Project  comprises  five  components.  The  individual  resettlement  plans  of  five \nsubprojects have been prepared in accordance with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Land \nAdministration Law and involuntary resettlement policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe resettlement plans provide a  socioeconomic profile of the people affected and scope of \nimpacts,  and  address  issues  related  to  entitlements:  compensation,  legal  framework,  public \nconsultations,  grievance  procedures,  rehabilitation  measures,  budget,  and  implementation \nmilestones.  Resettlement  planning  and  implementation  is  designed  to  ensure  that  all  those \naffected will be better-off or at least not worse-off as a result of the Project. \n \nA.  Resettlement Impacts \n \n2.  Impacts  related  to  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  include  people  affected  by  (i) \npermanent acquisition of land for the wetland park, sludge disposal facility, and pumping stations; \n(ii) temporary use of land for the rehabilitation of river banks and installation of trunk sewer \npipelines, and (iii) demolition of houses or buildings. The resettlement requirements have been \ncarefully  considered  and  incorporated  into  project  design.  Through  the  optimum  engineering \nproject  design,  the  resettlement  impacts  were  significantly  reduced.  As  a  result,  only  one \ncomponent will have significant land acquisition and resettlement impacts. \n \n3.  In total, the Project will require (i) permanent acquisition of 63.5 hectares (ha) of land, of \nwhich 33.5 ha is rural collective land; (ii) temporary acquisition of 97.6 ha, of which 12 ha is \nclassified as rural collective land; and (iii) demolition of 50,899 square meters (m2) of residential \nhousing and 48,895 m2 of enterprises and shops. Accordingly, 803 people will be affected, of which \n339 will be affected by permanent land acquisition, and 455 residents and 272 staff of enterprises \nand shops affected by house/building demolition. In addition, some public infrastructures and \nfacilities will be affected, including roads, culverts, fiber cables, electric poles, and transformers. No \nindigenous  people  or  ethnic  minorities  will  be  adversely  affected  by  the  Project.  The  project \nimpacts of the five components are summarized in Table A11.1.  \n \nB.  Policy and Legal Framework \n \n4.  As well as complying with the laws and regulations of the PRC and ADB\u2019s involuntary \nresettlement policy, the resettlement plans are based on the provisions of the Land Administrative \nLaw of the PRC (1999), and the State Council Decision to Deepen Reform and Strictly Enforce \nLand Administration (2004). In addition, the following associated laws and regulations are applied \nto resettlement under the Project: (i) Jiangsu Provincial Land Administration Regulation (2001), (ii) \nNanjing Municipal Land Acquisition and House Demolition Administration Regulation (2004), and \n(iii) Nanjing Municipal Land Expropriated Farmers\u2019 Basic Living Security Regulation (2004). \n \nTable A11.1:  Summary of Land Acquisition and Resettlement Impacts \nItem  Unit  C01a  C02  C03  C04  C05  Total \nA.

Based on consultations with local governments, those affected, and replacement cost, a set \nof  compensation  standards  will  be  adopted  by  the  project  implementing  agencies  (IAs).  The \nresettlement  principles  established  for  the  Project  are  (i)  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement should be avoided or minimized where feasible by developing and comparing a series \nof design alternatives; (ii) compensation and entitlements provided are based on market value or \nreplacement value and must be adequate to allow those affected to at least maintain their pre-\nproject standard of living with the prospect of improvement; (iii) land temporarily occupied should \nbe adequately compensated for and periods of disruption are to be kept to a minimum; (iv) farmers \nlosing working opportunities on the land have their registration changed to take advantage of \nregistration as urban residents; (v) a preferential policy will be provided to vulnerable groups in \nsuch  things  as  compensation,  housing  assignment,  transfer,  and  employment;  (vi)  all  those \naffected will be adequately informed about eligibility, compensation rates and standards, livelihood \nand income restoration plans, and project timing; and (vii) close monitoring and timely actions will \nbe carried out to identify and resolve any problems. \n \n6.  Seventy percent of the land compensation fee and entire resettlement subsidy will be \ndisbursed directly to the personal account of those affected to join a special pension system (Land \nExpropriated Farmers\u2019 Basic Living Security), which was established for land loss farmers with the \nsubsidy from the Nanjing municipal government. The remaining 30% of land compensation will be \nmanaged by the village committee for pubic purposes. For residential houses, enterprises, and \ncommercial shops, compensation will be paid to owners directly. The payment will be made in cash \naccording to the replaced value of the property. Households that have to relocate will also receive \na special subsidy for purchasing a new apartment, and a transfer and transportation allowance. \nCompensation for standing crops, auxiliaries, and other assets will be paid directly to affected \nfarmers. All infrastructure, facilities, and other assets will be compensated at replacement rates to \nallow full reconstruction by the owners. \n \nC.  Resettlement and Rehabilitation  \n \n7.  The resettlement strategy encompasses the restoration of livelihood and income. People \nlosing housing in rural areas have two resettlement options: receive cash compensation or apply \nfor economical affordable housing provided by the NMG. The new apartment housing will have \nbetter infrastructure, e.g., water, sewer, road, sanitary facilities, school, and supermarkets. The \nrespective  IAs  and  local  governments  will  provide  necessary  assistance  for  relocation  during \nresettlement and implementation.  \n \n ", "Appendix 11       53 \n8.  The economic rehabilitation measures include (i) provision of employment opportunities \nduring the project construction and operation phases; (ii) arrangements for those affected to benefit \nfrom  Land  Expropriated  Farmers\u2019  Basic  Living  Security,  and  the  individuals  can  choose  the \nstandard payment of basic living security; (iii) provision of skill training and employment information; \n(iv) provision of monthly living subsidy for affected farmers who are unemployed for a fixed time; (v) \nprovision of microcredit loans for business, subsidy for social insurance, and other preferential \nemployment policies; (vi) provision of the information of the vacant workshop or shop sites for \naffected enterprises or shops. \n \n9.  To ensure maximum protection of vulnerable households during the land acquisition and \nresettlement process, the following special provisions are made. First, vulnerable groups will be \ngiven priority for employment opportunities with the Project. Second, incorporation of the needs \nand interests of vulnerable groups in resettlement planning and implementation will be ensured \nthrough focused consultation and participation programs. Third, vulnerable groups living below the \nmunicipal poverty line can benefit from the minimum standard of living system for rural residents \nand get some allowance each month.  \n \nD.  Resettlement Cost and Fund Management  \n \n10.  The cost estimate for land acquisition and resettlement is CNY409.09 million, equivalent to \n$50.45 million, including contingencies, taxes, and fees for resettlement administration. This cost \nwill be included in the total project cost. According to the compensation policies and standards \ndefined in the resettlement plan, the payment and use of resettlement funds will be carried out \nunder the supervision of internal monitors with regular review by the external monitoring agency.  \n \nE.  Information Disclosure, Participation, and Grievance \n \n11.  People affected were notified about the key elements of the resettlement plans prior to ADB \nloan appraisal. On various occasions during meetings, interviews, focus group discussions, public \nconsultation  workshops,  and  community  consultation  meetings,  local  representatives  have \nparticipated in the planning, and concerns have been integrated into the resettlement plans. The \nresettlement information booklets or the draft resettlement plans were disseminated to affected \nhouseholds  and  village  offices  on  1  September  2006.  The  information  booklet  contains  the \nresettlement scope, project schedule, compensation rates for land and other assets, relocation and \neconomic rehabilitation strategies, and grievance redress mechanisms. The draft resettlement \nplans were uploaded onto the ADB website on 26 September 2006.2 The final resettlement plans \nwere uploaded onto the ADB website on 13 November 2006. The respective project IAs will \nestablish project resettlement units for supervising implementation, continuing public consultation, \nmonitoring progress, and responding to grievances. \n \nF.  Institutional Responsibilities  \n \n12.  The Nanjing project management office will coordinate the overall planning, implementation, \ninternal monitoring and evaluation, financing, and reporting of land acquisition and resettlement. \nEach IA will have concerned full-time staff responsible for land acquisition and resettlement. They \nwill work closely with relevant municipal and district land administration bureaus, house demolition \n                                                 \n2  Resettlement plans (RP) were prepared for all five components. Based on subsequent review by Environment and \nSocial Safeguard Division (RSES), it was decided that only three components required RPs, since two components \nhad no impacts on people. The three components with resettlement impacts included the (i) Inner Qinhuai River \nSewerage and Water Replenishment, (ii) City East Wastewater Treatment Plant, and (iii) Sludge Treatment. These will \nbe monitored for compliance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). \n   ", "54  Appendix 11 \noffices, and village/street officials; and will be responsible for delivering entitlements, distributing \neconomical affordable housing, and implementing the economic measures for those affected.  \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  The Nanjing municipal government and the IAs will take full responsibility for the internal \nmonitoring to ensure that the Project complies with requirements described in the resettlement \nplans. The project management office and IAs will engage an independent agency for semiannual \nmonitoring and annual evaluation of land acquisition and resettlement until 2 years after  the \ncompletion of land acquisition and resettlement. External monitoring reports will be submitted \ndirectly to both the project management office and ADB.   \n \nH.  Resettlement Implementation \n \n14.  Resettlement implementation will be scheduled to precede subproject construction. Given the \nasynchronous schedule for different components, land acquisition and resettlement activities will \ncommence from December 2006 to August 2008. Construction will not take place before those \naffected are fully compensated. Detailed measurement surveys will be conducted in each village, \nneighborhood, and enterprise; and the compensation contacts will be negotiated and signed with \nvillage committees, households, and enterprises. \n \n ", "Appendix 12       55 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC): \n \nThe Nanjing Qinhuai River Environmental Improvement Project has potential to benefit 2.9 million inhabitants through \nimprovements to the disposal of wastewater and flushing of the canal system. The Project will contribute to poverty \nreduction through increased quality of life by reducing the incidence of waterborne disease and flood risk in urban \nNanjing, and providing employment opportunities during construction and operation of the project facilities, with \nanticipated effects on economic development. \n \nThe Project will assist with the country\u2019s progress in meeting Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7, target 10 to \nhalve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation by increasing coverage of the Nanjing \nwastewater system to serve an additional 2.7 million people by 2010. It will contribute to estimated reductions in \nmedical costs incurred as a result of contracting waterborne disease in Nanjing amounting to approximately CNY142 \nper person, or CNY824 million total. Health benefits are expected to be felt disproportionately by women since they \nare more vulnerable to waterborne diseases due to greater contact with water from household responsibilities \n(especially cooking and washing), and are most responsible for care of the young and old when they are sick. \n \nThe Project will create approximately 60,000 person-years of work or an average of about 30,000 full-time equivalent \njobs during construction. Follow-on multiplier effects are expected to create an additional 78,000 full-time jobs. Three \nquarters of the construction jobs are assumed to be unskilled and are likely to be filled by the currently unemployed. \nSince unemployment is a cause of poverty in the project area, the poor will benefit disproportionately from this job \ncreation. Those temporarily employed in construction will benefit from additional training and experience that will \nprovide them with opportunities in future planned infrastructure projects. The associated wages for workers translate \nto CNY543 million of project costs that will return to the local economy. Project operations will create 450 full-time \npermanent jobs directly and another 710 jobs through multiplier effects, corresponding to approximately CNY42 million \nin wages per year. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                            Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention    \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA poverty and social analysis was undertaken in line with Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines to collect \ndetailed social information necessary to inform project design, and identify poverty reduction and social development \nobjectives,  outcomes,  and  indicators.  The  analysis  identifies  vulnerable  groups  and  opportunities  for  pro-poor \ninterventions; and recommends social action measures, participation, and mitigation plans to achieve positive social \nbenefits. \nNanjing City has a population of 6.24 million people or 1.912 million households. Approximately 5% of households \nlive in poverty. The poverty line in Nanjing (urban) is CNY260 per capita per month. The project socioeconomic \nanalysis identified that Nanjing\u2019s poor, defined as those living at or only just above the poverty line are 100% Han \nChinese and have an average age of 47. Most are retired (22.6%), casual laborers (17%), own their own business \n(16%), or unemployed (15%). They are most likely to live in a family of two people, in Bai Xia or Gulou districts in an \napartment (most likely ground floor or above the 7th floor) of one or two rooms, with a living area of 24.5 square \nmeters per person. Fifty-two percent of the poor own their dwelling. One third of the poor are either illiterate or have \nonly a primary education. Twenty-one percent of the poor have one child, and a further 6% have two children. Almost \nhalf (47%) of the poor are unmarried/widowed or live without a partner (61% female, 39% male\u2014the difference \nattributable to many more female senior citizens). Of these poor single adult households, 48% of households headed \nby women are in the 25\u201360 year age group (prime working and most likely married age group), and 42% of \nhouseholds headed by men are in the same age group. Twenty-three percent of poor single adult families are \nsupporting a child (78% female, 22% male). \n \nThe average poor household uses 7.8 tons of water per month based on their last water bill, 5 tons per month less \nthan the average Nanjing household. Seventy-one percent of the poor pay the tap water company for their water and \nwastewater, 2% pay a factory, 2% pay a neighbor, and 7% do not pay at all. Ninety-one percent of the poor are \n   ", "56  Appendix 12 \nconnected to the public sewer for disposal of wastewater, a further 4% discharge to an open drain, and 5% to a \nseptic tank. The poor are disproportionately affected by wastewater system constraints. Forty-one percent of the \npoor reported a major problem with wastewater overflows in their neighborhood (compared with 26% for the nonpoor), \nand 34% reported a major problem with bad smells from the wastewater system (compared with 27% for the \nnonpoor). The poor are also more likely to suffer from problems associated with stormwater drainage (42% compared \nwith 29% for the nonpoor) and surface flooding occurring two or more times a year (49% compared with 17% for the \nnonpoor). Despite this however, the poor and nonpoor have no significant differences with regard to incidence of \ndisease  linked  with  a  poor  sanitary  environment  and  others.  Apart  from  the  elderly,  the  other  two  groups \noverrepresented among the poor are those with relatively low education and the unemployed. Both these groups will \nbenefit from employment opportunities generated by the Project, where approximately two thirds of jobs are low- or \nunskilled. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe poverty and social assessment utilized a number of participation processes to solicit the input of a cross section \nof stakeholders. In addition to the socioeconomic survey of 655 households, a range of community meetings were held \nwith both women and men in different parts of the city to discuss, in an open-ended manner, topics related to the \nProject but not specifically covered in the socioeconomic survey. A number of key informant interviews were held \nwith  various  bureaus,  nongovernment  organizations,  women\u2019s  federation,  past  and  ongoing  projects  in \ncomplementary areas, etc. to inform project design. Formulation of resettlement plans used separate socioeconomic \nsurveys, community meetings, opinion surveys, and impact studies from April to June 2006, involving more than 500 \npeople.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nTargeted analysis reveals that public awareness of the Project is high and generally very positive. Development of \nthe environmental management plan and environmental impact assessment involved two rounds of public consultations \nin late May and early June 2006, shortly after beginning environmental impact assessment preparation. The purpose \nwas to introduce the Project and the relevant components and subcomponents to a range of stakeholders, and to \nsolicit their views on the Project and its potential environmental implications, so that the environmental impact \nassessment could take these into account. Most stakeholders already had good knowledge of the Project due to the \npreparation work undertaken by design institutes and the project management office (PMO). Both the resettlement \nplan and environmental management plan set out detailed ongoing public participation plans. Public participation is \nalso planned for project monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \n An assurance is included that men and women will have equal employment opportunity in the operation and \nmaintenance of infrastructure. Men stand to benefit more than women from the unskilled construction jobs that will be \ncreated through the Project, due to the requirement for physically demanding labor. However women\u2019s participation \nin the skilled operation and maintenance work will be encouraged as a number of women are already working in \nthese sectors and an equal number of male and female graduates have technical qualifications. Consultation with \nwomen will be required for the resettlement plans. The socioeconomic analysis shows that women are equally likely \nto be living in poverty as men, however are slightly overrepresented among the elderly poor, who are more likely to be \nfemale than male, and assumed to be a product of longer female life expectancy. Women in focus groups noted that \nthe improvement to riverside areas would benefit them disproportionately, providing safe, clean, well-lit areas for \nthem to walk and meet friends. Older women in recently improved areas reported much use of improved urban areas \nin their neighborhoods for exercise and recreation.  \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Financial Management Assessment. By May 2006, financial management assessment \nquestionnaires provided to the three IAs were complete. The project team met with the IAs\u2019 \naccounting  divisions  to  review  the  responses,  and  found  that  the  IAs  have  experience \nimplementing projects of a similar size to the proposed Project and their financial management \nis capable of properly handling the Project. \n \n3.  Financial Performance Assessment. The financial performance assessment is based \non  an  analysis  of  standard  financial  performance  ratios.  Nanjing  Municipal  Engineering \nConstruction Department (NMECD) and Nanjing Municipal Drainage Department (NDMD) are \nlegal entities within Nanjing Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, which is a part of the Nanjing \nmunicipal  government.  The  financial  performance  assessment  for  Nanjing  Construction \nInvestment Company (NCIC) is based on the financial ratios calculated from the company\u2019s \n2003, 2004, and 2005 audited financial statements.   \n \n4.  The financial performance assessment of NCIC is based on annual pro-forma financial \nstatements  encompassing  20  years,  commencing  with  the  commissioning  of  the  project \ncomponents  (Supplementary  Appendix  G).  NCIC  is  expected  to  achieve  the  covenanted \nfinancial and capital structure ratios once project operation commences.   \n \n5.  Financial Assessment of Project Subcomponents. The FIRR calculations of the six \nrevenue-generating  subcomponents  are  based  on  constant  2006  prices  using  incremental \nannual cash flows over 20 years of operations following commissioning of the civil works. \n ", "Appendix 13       59 \n6.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is \ncalculated in real terms for all project components based on nominal interest rates, income tax \nrate of 33%, and international and domestic rates of inflation (Table A13.2). \n  \nTable A13.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n  Financing Component \n  ADB  Domestic  NMG Funds  Total \nItem  Loan  Bank Loan \nA.

Financial  Internal  Rate  of  Return.  The  FIRR  is  calculated  for  each  project \nsubcomponent and ranges from 5.13% to 8.11%. The after-tax FIRR for the overall Project is \nestimated to be 6.20% for the base case scenario. These results compare favorably with the \nWACC of 2.79%. \n \n8.  Sensitivity  Analysis.  The  project  team  tested  the  following  four  scenarios  in  the \nsensitivity analysis, in addition to the base case: \n \n(i)  project investment cost increases by 10%, \n(ii)  project operating costs increase by 10%, \n(iii)  currency exchange rate increases by 10%, and \n(iv)  construction delayed by 1 year for wastewater projects. \n \n9.   Conclusion.  The  sensitivity  analysis  shows  robust  results.  Even  if  the  worse  case \nsituations occur, the FIRR exceeds the real WACC. Therefore, the Project is financially viable \nand sustainable. Nanjing municipal government is highly progressive on tariff reforms and has \ncommitted to raise CNY162 million ($20.0 million) directly from wastewater tariff increases for \nthe Project. Nanjing Price Bureau successfully held public hearing meetings on 28 August 2006 \nto discuss and seek public support for the proposed wastewater tariff increase from the current \nlevel of CNY1.05/m3 to CNY1.40/m3 by December 2006 and CNY1.60/m3 by 2010, exceeding \nthe estimated full cost-recovery requirement of CNY1.57/m3 in 2010. The water and wastewater \ntariff reforms in Nanjing will contribute significantly to the financial sustainability of the Project. \n \n \n   ", "60  Appendix 14 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \n1.  This  economic  analysis  of  the  proposed  Nanjing  Qinhuai  River  Environmental \nImprovement  Project  covers  project  justification,  general  parameters  for  economic  analysis, \nbenefits and costs, least-cost analysis, and calculations of the economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR).

Project Justification \n \n2.  The review of policy and planning documents and regulations shows that the Project is \nconsistent with the municipal pollution control and water management plans, and also with local \ninfrastructure development plans. Public perceptions and preferences were evaluated using a \nhousehold survey. The results demonstrate that the public gives high priority to wastewater \nmanagement,  waterborne  disease prevention,  river  cleaning,  and  flood-damage  control.  The \nProject will benefit more than 2.7 million urban residents of Nanjing whose living conditions and \npublic health standards will be improved. In addition, another 0.7 million unregistered floating \npeople (temporary rural-to-urban migrants) will benefit from the Project. \n \n ", "Appendix 14         61 \nB.   General Parameters \n \n3.  The economic analysis was conducted by comparing situations with- and without-Project. \nThe study period covers 25 years including 5 years of construction from 2007 to 2011. Economic \nbenefits and costs are denominated in domestic price numeraire and expressed in constant 2006 \nprices. Tradable components are converted to economic prices using a shadow exchange rate \nfactor of 1.013, and nontraded components are valued at domestic market prices. A shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.67 was applied to the wage of unskilled labor to account for unemployment \nand underemployment.  \n \nC.   Costs \n \n4.  Project costs include capital investment costs and operation and maintenance costs. \nCosts were allocated to tradable, nontradable, skilled, and unskilled labor. Appropriate conversion \nfactors, e.g., shadow exchange rate and shadow wage rate, were applied accordingly. Transfer \npayments, including taxes and interests, are excluded from the economic costs, while physical \ncontingencies are included.  \n \nD.   Benefits \n \n5.  Floods affect, on average, about 7% of the population in the project area each year. The \nfour subcomponents with a flood-reduction impact (I.2+3+4; II.3+4+5; III.2+3; IV.1) will have direct \nbenefits for 100,000 households, equivalent to about 281,000 people. According to the household \naurvey, as the Project is expected to reduce the probability of flooding in the project area by 90%, \nthe value of annual flood losses avoided would be CNY523 per household likely to experience a \nflood loss. The total benefits to the 100,000 households would thus be around CNY52.3 million. \nSuch benefits, however, only account for direct losses of the households without considering \ndirect losses and indirect losses to other sectors in the economy. To address this issue, an area-\nbased total flood damage estimate was used to make the benefit forecast. According to the \nDartmouth College flood database, which is based on the historical data in the project province \nfrom 1989 to 2005, a typical flood in the project area causes total damage of $91,042 per square \nkilometer (km2), which includes direct, indirect, and induced economic losses to households, \ncommerce, industry, and agriculture. Applying such an area-based estimate to the Project is a \nconservative estimate because it is an average over a combined urban and rural area, and actual \nlosses of agricultural production in rural areas are lower than losses experienced by commerce \nand industry in urban areas on a per km2 basis. The Project is expected to reduce flood damage \nby 90% in a total area of about 311.05 km2.  \n \n6.   Wastewater management subcomponents (II.2; V.1) include a new wastewater treatment \nfacility with a capacity of 100,000 cubic meters (m3) per day (i.e., 36.5 million m3 per year) at the \nCity East site, and a new sludge treatment facility with a capacity of 50,000 tons at the Jiang Xin \nZhou site, which currently has a wastewater treatment capacity of 233.6 million m3 per year. \nAccording to the household survey, which was based on the previous projects\u2019 successful survey \nmethodology and questionnaire design, an average household in the project area is willing to pay \nCNY0.164 per ton of water consumed for the increased wastewater treatment capacity. A recent \nstudy sponsored by the United Nations indicates that the unit cost for small- to medium-sized \nindustrial plants to treat industrial wastewater is CNY1.46 per m3. Given that the Project will \nincrease the city\u2019s wastewater treatment ratio from 75% to 85%, the industrial willingness to pay \n(WTP) for the Project is assumed to be 10% of the unit cost of industrial wastewater treatment, \ni.e., CNY0.146 per m3. Water consumption data were collected from the Public Utility Bureau. \nGiven the competing forces of the increased population (including rural in-migrants) that will \n   ", "62  Appendix 14 \nincrease the water demand versus the increased water tariff that may lower the demand, the \nfuture water consumption was forecast by assuming a minor annual growth rate of 0.5%.   \n \n7.   The lack of proper sewers and stagnant waters in clogged drains, canals, and moats are \nbelieved to be a major cause of waterborne disease. Six subcomponents (I.1, I.2+3+4; II.1; III.1; \nIII.2+3; V.2) will have a health cost-reduction benefit: (i) Inner Qinhuai River sewer interceptors \nwith a capacity of processing 149 million m3 of wastewater per year, (ii) Inner Qinhuai River water \nreplenishment, (iii) City East 23 km of new sewers, (iv) North He Xi District 28.7 km of new \nsewers, (v) Hexi District river improvement and (vi) sludge disposal facility at Mount Fenghuang. \nThe health cost reductions will directly benefit 19.9% of the households living in the project area, \nwhich has a total of 112,000 beneficiary households (about 314,720 people). The economic value \nof the annual health cost savings (40% reduction in annual costs) is expected to be CNY400 per \nhousehold.  Thus,  the  total  benefits  to  the  112,000  beneficiary  households  will  be  CNY44.8 \nmillion. If the WTP is used, health benefits should be removed from the benefits part to avoid \ndouble counting, unless the WTP does not cover positive externality effects of the health benefits. \nTo be conservative, this analysis did not include health benefits because the WTP was used in all \nthe components whenever it is applicable.  \n \n8.  In addition, the Project is likely to improve tourism and increase property values in the \nproject area. Also, the public-private partnership used in this Project will provide a practical model \nfor future urban infrastructure financing and have the potential to improve the efficiency of the \npublic capital market.  To avoid double counting and be conservative in the analysis, these \npotential benefits were not included in the benefit-cost analysis. Also, the benefits from the \nProject\u2019s economic multiplier effects were not considered as they are difficult to quantify.  \n \nE.  Distribution of Project Costs and Benefits \n \n9.  The direct beneficiaries include the estimated 87,000 registered residents living below the \nofficial poverty line and many of the approximately 700,000 nonregistered migrants in search of \nwork in the city. The urban poor will derive disproportionately greater benefits from the Project \nsince they generally live in poorly served neighborhoods; while project costs are relatively heavier \non enterprises and the better-off households given government\u2019s progressive taxation, user fees, \nand poverty reduction policies.  \n \nF.   Least-Cost Analysis \n \n10.   The  least-cost  analysis  of  alternative  technologies  and  materials  to  be  used  in \nsubcomponents was based on the incremental economic costs over the alternatives\u2019 economic \nlives. A discount rate of 12% was used to calculate the present value of economic costs and \naverage incremental economic costs. The present value of economic cost approach was adopted \nfor the sewerage network subproject and river improvement subproject where a measurable \noutput  is  not  available.  The  average  incremental  economic  cost  approach  was  used  for \ncomponents  with  a  measurable  output,  such  as  the  City  East  wastewater  treatment  plant \n(WWTP). All costs and outputs are estimated by comparing situations with and without the \nProject.  \n \n(i)  For the sewerage network, using high density polyethylene pipes was found to be \ncost-effective compared to using reinforced concrete (RC) pipes.  \n(ii)  For the WWTP, using the anaerobic anoxic oxidation (A2O) process was found to \nbe less costly than using the Orbal oxidation process.   \n ", "Appendix 14         63 \n(iii)  For the river improvement components, using lump stone for lining of river banks \nwas found to be less costly than using reinforced concrete.  \n \nG.   Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n11.   The expected EIRR of the four subcomponents with flood-reduction benefits (Table A14.2) \nranges from 15.1% for the North He Xi District river improvement subcomponent, to 28.2% for the \nCity East Upper Qinhuai River improvement subcomponent. The EIRR of the six subcomponents \nwith health cost-reduction benefits ranges from 15.1% for the City East new sewer pipelines \nsubcomponent to 16.5% for the Inner Qinhuai sewer interceptors subcomponent (Table A14.3). \nThe EIRR of the two subcomponents with wastewater and sludge treatment are 16.3% for the \nnew City East 100,000 m3 per day WWTP and 16.7% for the Jiang Xin Zhou sludge treatment \nplant (Table A14.4). The EIRR for the whole Project, including all 10 subcomponents or activities, \nis 21.6%; the Project\u2019s economic net present value discounted at 12% is CNY855.6 million. The \nsensitivity  analysis  shows  that  increasing  capital  investment  costs  by  15%,  or  increasing \noperation and maintenance costs by 20%, or delaying total benefits by 1 year will not result in an \nEIRR lower than the cutoff rate of 12%. Thus, the results of the economic analysis are robust and \nthe Project is economically viable.   \n \nTable A14. 2.
