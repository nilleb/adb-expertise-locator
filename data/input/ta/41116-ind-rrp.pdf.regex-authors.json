An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  was \nalso  prepared  to  guide  the  environmental  assessment  of \nsubprojects in future loans, including those that may be classified \nas category A. The Summary IEE of Project 1 and the EARF of \nthe program have been disclosed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \u201c120 \ndays\u201d rule . \n   \nSector Investment  The proposed Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Development \nProgram  Investment Program (the Program) will foster economic growth in \nthe state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K). It involves the expansion \nof  basic  services,  such  as  water  supply,  sanitation,  waste \nmanagement, urban transport, and other municipal functions, in \nJammu,  Srinagar,  and  other  important  towns  and  commercial \ncenters. The investment program will also strengthen the service \ndelivery  capacity  of  the  responsible  state  urban  agencies  and \nurban local bodies (ULBs) through management reforms, capacity \nbuilding, and training.  \n \nMultitranche Financing  The  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF,  or  the  Facility)  will \nFacility  finance  projects  under  the  investment  program,  provided  the \nGovernment of India and the government of J&K comply with the \nassurances to ADB and the constituent projects are in line with \nthose assurances and with the criteria set out in the Framework \nFinancing Agreement (FFA). \n \n  ADB will provide loans to finance projects under the Facility as \nsoon as the projects are ready for financing upon submission of \nsatisfactory  related  periodic  financing  request.  Each  loan  will \nconstitute  a  tranche  and  may  carry  terms  different  from  the \nfinancing terms of previous or later loans. The choice of financing \nterms will depend on the project and ADB\u2019s financing policies at \nthe time the loan is documented in a legal document. Tranches \nmay be provided in sequence or simultaneously, and may overlap. \n \n ", "ii   \n   \nRationale  Apart from the national priority of planned development of major \nurban centers in India, the proposed investment program will also \nfoster economic revival in J&K, where trade, services, and tourism \nare the principal drivers of the economy. Low investment in asset \ncreation and in operation and maintenance (O&M) and lack of \nstructured institutional systems constrain growth in J&K. The state \ngovernment intends to promote economic growth through better \nservice, public health, and environmental conditions by investing \nin urban infrastructure and improving the management capabilities \nof its line agencies and the participating cities and towns. \n \n  The core strategy is to provide investment funds in a prioritized \nmanner, building on the infrastructure rehabilitation being carried \nout  under  the  ongoing  loan  (2151-IND:  Multisector  Project  for \nInfrastructure Rehabilitation in J&K), with planned expansion in \ntandem with urban governance improvements and reforms. The \nstate needs to balance progress on reforms, priority infrastructure \ninvestments, and private sector investment particularly in trade \nand tourism. A sector loan with an MFF offers the borrower the \nflexibility  of  basing  investment  decisions  on  priorities  and \nconstraints defined in the sector policy and master plans. The \nsubsector master plans being developed as part of the ongoing \nloan will form the basis for investments made under the Facility. \n \n  Subsector master plans and growth trends indicate a need for \nabout  $2  billion  equivalent  in  longer-term  (up  to  2026) \ninfrastructure  investments  in  the  principal  centers.  The  state \nproposes to obtain about $1.29 billion of this amount for the most \nurgent requirements from various funding sources including the \nproposed Program and the ongoing Jawaharlal Nehru National \nUrban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  the  urban  reform  and \ninvestment program supported by the Government. \n   \n ", "  iii\nImpact and Outcome  The  Program  is  expected  to  sustain  economic  growth  by \nimproving urban infrastructure services and urban management in \nJammu and Srinagar, and selected towns and commercial centers \nin the state. The priorities and constraints are addressed in the \nsector policy and master plan. The subsector master plans, which \nare being updated as part of the ongoing loan, will form the basis \nfor later investments. \n \nThe proposed investment program will improve public health, the \nliving  environment,  and  employment  opportunities  for  the  2.4 \nmillion people living in Srinagar, Jammu, and other participating \ntowns of commercial importance. It will also improve the capacity \nof  participating  institutions,  particularly  the  new  municipal \ncorporations of Jammu and Srinagar, to manage sector reforms \nand deliver services.  \n \nThe investment program will not hinder or adversely affect any \nethnic groups or indigenous peoples. On the other hand, it will \nbenefit everyone in the investment program area. \n   \nProgram Investment Plan   India  has  requested  ADB  to  finance  the  investment  program \nthrough  an  MFF.  The  total  cost  of  the  investment  program  is \nestimated at $485 million, including $44.3 million in taxes and \nduties. \n   \n   \nFinancing Plan  Total Cost  Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank  300  62 \nGovernment of Jammu and  185  38 \nKashmir \n   Total   485  100 \n   \nFacility Amount and  A facility of up to $300 million from the ordinary capital resources \nTerms  of ADB will be provided to India under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)\u2013based lending facility.  \n \nThe Government of India will cause the state government of J&K \nto use the proceeds of each tranche for the expenditures of the \ninvestment program, according to the conditions set forth in the \nFFA and the legal agreements for each tranche.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA), Jammu and Kashmir \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The  Government  of  India,  according  to  its  current  policy,  will \nTerms  relend 90% of the first loan as a grant and 10% as a loan to the \nstate government of J&K. The latter, in turn, will transfer all the \nfunds as a grant to the Executing Agency. \n ", "iv   \n  The  Government  will  assume  the  foreign  exchange  and \ninterest-rate risks for the loans under the Facility.  \n \nThe Government will provide the proceeds of future loans under \nthe  Facility  to  the  J&K  government  on  terms  and  conditions \napplicable to the Government\u2019s own lending at the time the loan is \ndocumented in a legal document. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The investment program resources will tentatively be available in \nfour tranches until December 2015 (the last periodic financing \nrequest  is  expected  to  be  submitted  by  31  August  2013). \nDepending on the speed of reforms, the development of ERA\u2019s \ncapacity,  and  demand,  the  proposed  four  tranches  could  be \nconverted to five or six tranches.  \n   \nEstimated Program  30 June  2015 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  ERA,  under  its  chief  executive  officer  (CEO),  will  be  the \nArrangements  Executing  Agency  (EA)  of  the  investment  program.  Policy \ndirection and strategic oversight will be provided by a governing \nbody chaired by the J&K minister for planning and with the chief \nsecretary  and  principal  secretaries  of  responsible  line \ndepartments as members. An executive committee established by \nthe State, shall be responsible to guide ERA on matters related to \nProject activities. For day to day administration, the CEO shall be \nguided by the Executive Committee. It consists of the department \nheads of the state line agencies and is headed by the CEO of the \nERA. \n \nTwo  project  management  units  (PMUs)  have  already  been \ncreated under the ERA for the implementation of the ongoing \nLoan  2151-IND  and  for  the  proposed  investment  program  in \nSrinagar and Jammu. Each PMU is headed by a full-time project \ndirector,  reporting  to  the  CEO,  ERA.  The  PMUs  will  identify, \nappraise, formulate, and implement all subprojects and ensure \ncompliance with the social and environmental safeguard policies \nof the state, the country, and ADB. City and towns based local \nsteering  committees  will  be  formed  to  facilitate  interaction \nbetween the ERA and the ULBs and line agencies, lead urban \nmanagement programs, and disseminate information. \n   \nCommunity Participation  Community priorities expressed during participatory planning will \nbe considered in the planning and design of facilities, particularly \nthose in low-income areas. The ERA, which has two community \nparticipation/public relations officers, will be further strengthened \nby the addition of community participation consultants.  \n   \n ", "  v\nProcurement  Procurement financed from the ADB loans under the MFF will \nconform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended \nfrom time to time). Civil works contracts of at least $10 million will \nbe  through  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB),  and  those \ncosting less than $10 million will be under national competitive \nbidding  (NCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Single-stage, \ntwo-envelope bidding with post-qualification will be adopted for all \nNCB and ICB civil works contracts under the investment program. \nSpecialized  and  small  community  works  costing  less  than \n$100,000 may be directly contracted, as approved by ADB on a \ncase by case basis.   \n \nIn the procurement of goods and related services, ICB will be \nused for contracts of at least $1 million and NCB for contracts of \nless  than  $1  million.  For  specialized  equipment,  proprietary \nsoftware  and  small  materials  contracts  valued  at  less  than \n$100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping procedures may be followed. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  hired  for  project  management,  design  and \nconstruction supervision, institutional development and capacity \nbuilding, and benefit monitoring. Agencies or institutions [that may \ninclude  established  registered  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)]  will  also  be  hired  to  carry  out  public  awareness  and \ncommunity participation programs and to facilitate and monitor \nresettlement implementation. All consultants and NGOs will be \nhired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2006, as amended from time to time).  \n   \nBenefits and Beneficiaries  The  investment  program  will  promote  economic  growth  and \ndevelopment, and the overall socioeconomic status and quality of \nlife of beneficiaries in the project cities, by improving water supply, \nsewerage,  and  solid  waste  disposal  facilities,  urban  roads, \ntransport and connectivity, and other urban services, and building \ncapacity for responsive urban governance. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The key risks relate to (i) the commitment of the J&K government \n  to reforms including devolution of powers to ULBs, (iii) acquisition \nof land for subprojects, (iv) transfer of resources and counterpart \nfunds  for  the  investment  program,  (iv)  timely  selection  of \nconsultants  and  contractors,  and  (v)  adequate  staffing  of  the \nPMUs. These risks are covered by mitigation measures included \nin the design.  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  India  for  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Urban  Sector \nDevelopment Investment Program (the Program).1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis of the Urban Sector in Jammu and Kashmir \n2.  The state of Jammu and Kashmir\u2019s (J&K) economy depends mainly on agriculture, \ntourism, services and handicrafts. The basic urban services in the main towns are dilapidated \nand grossly undersized due in part to in-migration from the rural areas and partly due to a lack \nof investment. However, economic activity is improving and the service sector which has grown \nover the last 5 years now contributes more than 50% of the state\u2019s gross domestic product. The \nplanned and sustainable growth of the urban centers, particularly the two principal cities of \nSrinagar and Jammu, where the bulk of trade and commerce takes place, is an essential part of \nJ&K\u2019s economic strategy, as stated in its 11th Five Year Plan (2007\u20132012). \n \n3.  J&K, spread over an area of 222,236 square kilometers (km2), comprises three distinct \nregions\u2014Jammu,  Kashmir,  and  Ladakh\u2014divided  into  14  districts,  with  a  population  of \n10.14 million (2001 census). The population is mostly rural, the urban population being less than \n25% (24.81%). The urban population of 2.52 million (2001 census) is distributed over 75 census \ntowns, but about 63% live in Jammu and Srinagar. Jammu and Srinagar are important trading \ncenters for the surrounding predominantly rural areas. Some district centers are growing tourist \ndestinations, which also require support with planning, developmental controls and financing of \nbasic infrastructure to encourage and support private sector investments. \n \n4.  In Jammu and Srinagar only 40% of the population has access to safe drinking water \nand more than 32% of the urban population lives in slums where basic amenities are lacking. \nThe new settlements in Srinagar and Jammu, swelled with 600,000 migrants from the rural \nareas,  lack  piped  water,  proper  sanitation,  and  proper  road  access.  Improving  literacy  is \nincreasing the aspirations of the younger urban population for better economic opportunities, \npublic health, cleaner environment and better quality of life. Public demand for improvements \nhas increased since the first municipal elections in Jammu and Srinagar were held in 2005.     \n   \n5.  Tens of thousands of pilgrims visit religious shrines in the area for various festivals and \nalong with the increasing tourists, both domestic and foreign, require better facilities to protect \nthe fragile environment. Srinagar in particular has a large tourist population in the summer \nmonths, drawn by the world-famous Dal Lake and the tourist areas in Kashmir, including the \nregional towns and pristine mountain areas, to which the city is the gateway.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  The 2001 populations in Srinagar and Jammu2 were 971,357 and 607,642, respectively. \nThe outdated and undersized urban facilities suffer weak operation and management. More \nthan 96% of the households in both cities have access to piped water, but with more than 50% \nsystem losses due to leaks, illegal connections, and poor records. Ad hoc and partial extension \nof the distribution network to provide basic services to the migrant areas has led to low levels of \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework for the investment program is in Appendix 1.  \n2  Only the municipal area and not the surrounding urban agglomeration. \n ", "2   \nsupply, particularly in Jammu, where some areas receive only 1\u20132 hours of water per day. \nWater supply operations in both cities suffer acutely from frequent and extended electric supply \nshortages, low voltage, and low pressure at higher points and ends of the distribution systems. \nTo address the most urgent needs, ADB provided Loan 2151-IND3 (the ongoing project) to \nrehabilitate the water supply systems including pumping machinery, treatment plants, and the \ntransmission and distribution network. Water supply in the key towns and commercial centers \nrequires expansion, and new sewerage systems and improved solid waste management are \nneeded to protect public health and the environment. \n \n7.  Srinagar  and  Jammu  lack  piped  systems  for  sewage  collection  and  requires  more \ntreatment capacity. While many houses in the less densely populated areas of Jammu have \nseptic tanks, most houses in the more congested parts of Jammu and Srinagar discharge their \nwastes into open surface drains endangering public health and water quality in local streams, \nrivers, and lakes. In the older sections of both cities night soil is commonly collected manually \nand improperly disposed into local drains and solid waste containers. The regional towns and \ncommercial centers have no sewage collection and disposal facilities. Most dwellings rely on pit \nlatrines and commercial developments use septic tanks. \n \n8.  In Srinagar, the fragile ecosystem of lakes and water bodies is seriously endangered by \nthe discharge of untreated municipal sewage and dumping of solid wastes. Lakes and other \nwater bodies are becoming increasingly polluted by sewage from surrounding residential and \ncommercial developments, and the hundreds of houseboats on the lakes which are popular with \ntourists, causing eutrophic conditions with heavy weed and algal growth. Unless the pollution is \nintercepted,  the  water  quality  will  continue  to  deteriorate  damaging  the  environment  and \ndiscouraging tourism. Under a program sponsored by the Government, sewage collection and \ntreatment facilities are being built to intercept and treat sewage from the areas around Dal Lake. \nBut additional funding is needed to connect properties to the street lines and to extend the \nsewage  networks.  The  ongoing  project  is  rehabilitating  sewerage  and  drainage  pumping \nstations and updating integrated sewerage and drainage master plans to guide the additional \ninvestments in cities and towns participating in the Program. \n \n9.  Less than half of the municipal solid waste (MSW) in Srinagar and Jammu is collected. \nMSW in Srinagar goes to a designated dump site, but this operation is unscientific and receives \nbiomedical wastes and night soil. The site threatens the quality of groundwater, emits odors, \nattracts flies and other vectors and requires upgrading or closure. Jammu has no designated \ndisposal  area  and  solid  waste  is  indiscriminately  dumped  in  drains  and  along  riverbanks, \ncausing grave risk to water quality, the environment and health of downstream users. In the \nsmaller district towns and tourist areas, collection is not organized and indiscriminate dumping is \nthreatening not only the health of local citizens but also the environment. \n \n10.  Traffic congestion caused by security operations, lack of regulation, and the growing \nnumbers of personal vehicles is not only costing productive time and wasted fuel but also \ncausing air pollution in both cities. While the ongoing project is rehabilitating roads and some \nbridges, it will not build new facilities. City growth strategies and updated master plans are being \ndeveloped to guide investments under the Program. \n \n11.  The  earthquake  on  8  October  2005,  which  devastated  large  areas  in  neighboring \nPakistan and caused extensive damage in northwest areas of J&K, underscored the need for \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2004.

Manila (Loan 2151-IND, for $250 \nmillion, approved on 22 December 2004).  \n ", "  3   \ndisaster mitigation measures. As most of the state is in earthquake zone 5 (severe risk) new \nand existing building will need to be strengthened against earthquakes. \n \n12.  Urban Planning and Governance. J&K has special status within the Indian Union and \nis  not  required  to  follow  the  provisions  of  the  74th  Constitutional  Amendment  Act,  which \nempowers local city governments. But the state introduced the revised Municipal Act in 2000 \nand held elections in Jammu and Srinagar in 2005. However, effective urban management is \nconstrained by the multiplicity of institutions with overlapping responsibilities and lack of funds. \nThe functions of the municipal corporations of Jammu and Srinagar are confined to public health \nservices such as SWM, food quality, vital statistics, vector control, building regulation and other \nbasic  development  management  functions.  Water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  drainage  are \nrespectively provided by the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) and the Urban \nEnvironmental Engineering Department (UEED) of the state. Local authorities are responsible \nfor town planning and land development but do not have the capacity to make or enforce plans. \nAs a result ad hoc and unplanned building activity, sale of public lands, and unregulated urban \nexpansion have resulted. \n \n13.  Institutional Finances. All cities and towns rely on the state for about 80% of their \nbudget. Their local revenues are limited to rentals from commercial establishments and building \npermit fees, which have not kept up with the market. Property tax as provided for under the \nMunicipal  Act  is  not  implemented  by  the  cities.  Less  than  50%  of  water  consumers  are \nregistered and billed, and PHED only charges 50% of the cost of providing the water supply \nservices. Moreover, it collects from only about half of those billed, so the revenues only account \nfor about 11% of the actual costs. Power supply, the most significant cost of water supply, \nparticularly in Jammu, are directly paid by the state and are not recovered from users by PHED.     \n \n14.  Revenue generation and budgeting by the cities is hampered by the lack of their own \nrevenue sources, irregular fund transfers from the state to PHED and UEED, and outdated \naccounting practices. The bulk of financial resources are spent on salaries and administration \nexpenses, leaving limited resources for operation and maintenance (O&M). J&K is committed to \nmaking services more efficient and service providers more accountable to citizens. The state is \na signatory to the Urban Reforms Initiative Fund Program of the Government, under which \nstates must show their commitment to accounting and cost recovery reforms to gain access to \ngrants under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM). JNNURM is a \ncentral government initiative to assist 63 major cities of India with their urban infrastructure \nprojects on the basis of comprehensive development plans and commitment to a range of urban \nsector reforms. The conditions for JNNURM grant funds are basically the same as those of \nADB.  As  part  of  its  urban  road  map,  the  state  is  incorporating  JNNURM  funds  for  the \ndevelopment of Srinagar and Jammu.   \n \n15.  External Assistance. The ongoing project is the first major external assistance to J&K \nin the past 20 years. Appendix 2 gives details of external support to the urban sector in India \nand shows that since 1993, ADB has provided 31 technical assistance (TA) grants and 12 loans \namounting to $17 million and $2.9 billion, respectively. The assistance has been aimed at \npoverty reduction through shared growth, social development, and good governance. These \nobjectives have been translated into action through integrated urban infrastructure projects. \nADB provided a project preparation technical assistance (PPTA) 4515-IND4 for the Program. \n \n16.   Ongoing Project. The ongoing project has been under implementation for the past 24 \nmonths. Contracts worth $80 million in ADB financing have already been awarded and $10 \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Proposed JKUSDP. Manila (PPTA 4515-IND for \n$500,000, approved on 22 December 2004).  \n ", "4   \nmillion have been disbursed. At the current rate of progress, the detailed design and tendering \nof  all  civil  works  packages  under  the  project  will  be  completed  by  September  2007.  The \nprogress is generally satisfactory, especially given the special circumstances in J&K. \n \n18.  Lessons. ADB\u2019s experience in the urban sector in India as summarized in the recently \ncompleted urban sector study5 shows that urban sector projects are inherently complex and \ntheir implementation requires close coordination between several agencies, experienced staff \nand strong support from senior levels of the state government. Institutional reforms such as \nincreases in water supply and sewerage tariffs are needed but are not acceptable unless \npreceded  by  infrastructure  expansion,  improvement  of  services  and  extensive  stakeholder \nconsultation. Even modest increases in property tax, tariff structures and reforms in municipal \nmanagement are difficult. Land acquisition, resettlement and statutory clearances from central \nand state agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India, state pollution control \nboards, railways and forest departments need to be taken into account at the design stage.  \n \n19.  Implementation of urban projects is slow mainly due to a lack of experience with major \ninvestment  programs.  Experienced  dynamic  high-level  project  leadership  by  the  executing \nagency (EA) and adequately trained and experienced staff are prerequisites. These are lacking \nwith  state  agencies  and  cities,  especially  when  it  is  their  first  externally  aided  project. \nCompliance with the safeguards and guidelines of the state, India and ADB requires provision of \nsupport and training. The lack of experienced consultants and contractors in the urban sector is \na  major  cause  of  delays,  exacerbated  by  the  booming  economy.  These  human  resource \nconstraints are slowing planning, design, procurement and construction activities on all projects \nincluding the ongoing one in J&K. Contracts, particularly for sewerage works often have to be \nextended to more than twice the contracted period. The ongoing project in J&K indicates that \ncapable contractors are more likely to bid for larger rather than smaller packages. \n  \n20.  Another  reason  for  slow  implementation  in  the  past  has  been  lack  of  project \npreparedness by the EAs resulting in more than 2 years of time lost while the EA was being \nstaffed and consultants were recruited. Lack of data and information during project preparation \nimpedes project planning, substantially delays design and implementation, leads to changes in \nscope and time overruns. The average time to complete urban projects in India is 8 years.  \n \n21.  These  lessons  were  incorporated  in  the  formulation  of  the  proposed  Program.  The \ncomponents of the project were selected after extensive consultation with various stakeholders \ntaking their priorities and demands into account in the design. The institutional development \ncomponent is designed to ensure the availability of adequate financial resources for O&M \nthrough well-defined, regular, and targeted fund transfers from the state to the responsible \ninstitutions in the near to mid term, enhancement of staff capacities through structured training \nand skill upgrading programs, and gradual transformation of user departments toward more \nbusiness-oriented operations. Further, the priority investments are linked to incremental reforms \nwith substantive support for reforms and capacity building as part of the first tranche. Capacity-\nbuilding activities in the road map include support for the transition to modern accounting \nsystems in the municipal corporations, business process improvements through e-governance, \nlegislative changes and other institutional development activities, hands-on training in project \nimplementation, and support for knowledge management. \n \n22.  Program Rationale. The rationale for the Program includes the Government\u2019s priority to \nimprove planning and development of major urban centers, and the economic revival of J&K. \nThe state intends to promote economic growth by improving service levels, public health and \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2006. Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations. Manila (June).  \n ", "  5   \nenvironmental conditions, and management capabilities in state line departments and in the \nparticipating cities. The core strategy is to provide investment funds in a prioritized manner, \nbuilding on the rehabilitation of essential infrastructure under the ongoing loan with planned \nexpansion in tandem with improvements and reforms in urban governance in the participating \ncities. The Government\u2019s JNNURM proposals have been incorporated in the design of the \nProgram and the sector loan format provides the flexibility to balance physical expansion with \nurban reforms and capacity development over the 8 year Program period. The master plans \nbeing updated under the current loan will form the basis for later investments in the Program.  \n \n23.  The master plans and projected urban growth patterns have been used to develop a \nroad map for about $2 billion of investments in urban related infrastructure through 2026 in the \nJammu, Srinagar and key towns and commercial centers in J&K. The state proposes to obtain \nfunding for the most urgent works required over the next 10 years estimated to cost $1.26 billion \nas  follows;  $110  million  from  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  project,  about  $200  million  from \nongoing planned expenditures, $500 million from JNNURM and $454 million under the Program. \nThe remaining $740 million required in the latter part of the 20-year period would be raised \nthrough a combination of state and Government support, commercial borrowings, and public-\nprivate partnership arrangements, which should evolve as the two cities improve their financial \nsituation over the next 10\u201315 years. \n \n24.   The road map for the Program includes extensive support for institutional development. \nThe principal reforms include: (i) cost-reflective and volume based tariffs for water supply and \nsewerage services, (ii) property tax, (iii) transfer of responsibility for water supply and sewerage \nservices in Srinagar and Jammu to semiautonomous water and sewerage boards, (iv) locally \ndriven  urban  planning  and  control,  and  (vi)  development  of  public-private  partnerships  in \nprovision of services. Legislation already is in place for volume based charges for water and \nsewage,  and  for  property  tax.  Further  legislation  to  strengthen  the  fledgling  municipal \ncorporations may be required to transfer the responsibility for provision water and sewage to the \ncities  from  the  current  state  departments.  Capacity  building  includes  transition  to  modern \naccounting  systems  in  the  municipal  corporations,  computerization,  business  process \nimprovements  through  e-governance,  hands-on  training  in  project  planning,  design  and \nimplementation, and support for knowledge management activities. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n25.  The proposed Program will improve urban services to Indian standards in the main \nurban areas of J&K, promote commerce, improve service access by the poor and generally \nsupport the reviving economy of the state. It will improve public health, the urban environment \nand living conditions for the 2 million people projected to live in the two principal cities of \nSrinagar and Jammu and the participating towns, as well as for the growing numbers of tourists.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n26.  The outputs of the investment program are grouped into two parts. Part A will improve \n(i) water supply systems, by rehabilitating and expanding distribution networks and setting up \nnew supply systems; (ii) sewerage and sanitation, by extending existing systems, constructing \nnew ones, and supplying sanitation maintenance equipment; (iii) MSW collection, processing, \ntreatment,  and  disposal  through  sanitary  landfills;  (iv)  road  and  intersection  capacity,  road \nsafety, and pedestrian overpasses; and (v) other municipal facilities that may be prioritized as \nthe master plans are updated and finalized in the participating towns and cities. Part B covers \n ", "6   \nmanagement and implementation support required to implement the physical works and a \ncomprehensive capacity-building and institutional development program that will result in a more \nresponsive state system, empowered local governments, a separate entity for managing water \nsupply and sewerage services on modern business principles, improved financial performance \nof the local bodies and service providers, and overall improved levels of service to citizens.  \n \n1.  Part A: Urban Infrastructure and Services Improvement \n \n27.  Water  Supply. With the rehabilitation of the water supply systems in Srinagar and \nJammu under the ongoing project, adequate water supply production, treatment, transmission, \nand distribution capacity is expected to be available by 2009 to meet the water supply needs of \nthe  projected  population  in  both  cities  until  2020  and  capacity  expansion  will  be  limited. \nHowever, there will be a strong focus on better management of water supply operations through \na demand management and metering plan. Works will be selected according to the master plan \npriorities and the outcome of the leakage detection and hydraulic modeling studies done under \nthe ongoing project. Combined with the ongoing project, the Program will provide water of good \nquality and adequate pressure, commensurate with Indian standards of 135 liters per capita per \nday, in all areas of the two principal cities by 2012. The Program will also rehabilitate and \nexpand water supply systems in Pahalgam, Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Patnitop, and other towns \nselected for their economic importance to the state. \n \n28.  Sewerage and Drainage. Consistent with government policy, sewerage investments will \nfocus on high density areas where piped underground sewerage is the best alternative for \nimproving sanitation and public health. Separate collection systems will be installed in the more \nrecently developed areas of the cities and district towns where road carriageways are wide \nenough.  But  in  the  old  city  core  areas  where  streets  are  narrow  a  combined  system  for \ncollecting sewage and storm water, with treatment of the dry weather flow will be provided. In \ncongested areas where there may be no room to install conventional systems, community/public \nsanitation facilities connected to the water and sewerage networks will be set up. The Program \nwill provide sewage collection and treatment for 75% and 30% respectively of the urban areas \nof Srinagar and Jammu, with the remainder being provided by JNNURM as required. Drainage \nrehabilitation works in the ongoing project are addressing the most urgent problems and the \nmaster plans being prepared will identify further works under the Program.  \n \n29.  Solid Waste Management (SWM).6 The SWM works aim to increase service coverage \nto 100% in both cities and participating district towns. The feasibility of linking the Program with \nthe Carbon Market Initiative7 and the Clean Development Mechanism8 will be explored as part \nof detailed planning. The state will ensure that biomedical waste from private hospitals and \nclinics  is  disposed  of  as  legislated.  But  facilities  for  collecting  and  properly  disposing  of \nbiomedical wastes from public hospitals will be incorporated in the Program.   \n                                                 \n6 Due to recent ongoing discussion between Srinagar Municipal Corporation and the local residents, the SWM \nsubproject appraised under Project 1 maybe shifted from the existing to a new site. ADB may consider this change \nif it becomes necessary subject to compliance by the State and ERA of all requirements of the Loan Agreement \nand applicable policies and procedures of ADB, India and the state; in which case loan funds may be available for \nthe subproject in the new site subject to compliances with all requirements under the Loan Agreement.. Additionally \nif the site is to be relocated the loan funds may also be used to finance proper closure of the existing site.    \n7  The Carbon  Market Initiative (CMI)  was  established by ADB (following the Kyoto Protocol) to  support the \nsustainable development goals of developing member countries, address concerns related to global climate \nchange, and assist developed countries in meeting their emission reduction commitments. CMI will provide for \neligible projects and their development a project cofinancing facility, carbon credit marketing program, and \ntechnical support for project preparation and implementation of Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). \n8  An arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol allowing industrialized countries with a greenhouse gas reduction \ncommitment  to  invest  in  projects  ensuring  emission  reduction  and  sustainable  development  in  developing \ncountries. \n ", "  7   \n \n30.  Urban Transportation. The Program will improve or provide (i) connectivity through \nexpansion of transportation facilities to major activity centers and towns (ii) facilities for off-street \nparking; (iii) pedestrian safety through subways and overpasses; (iv) street lighting; and (v) \nbridges and grade-separator flyovers or underpasses to decongest traffic, reduce pollution, and \nimprove the efficiency of public transport systems.  \n \n31.  Other Municipal and Urban Infrastructure. This component could include preservation \nof heritage, park and lake improvement, and other public facilities that may be identified in the \nmaster  plans  and  economic  opportunity  development  plans  (EODPs)  for  the  economically \nimportant  towns.  Selected  public  buildings  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu  such  as  schools  and \nhospitals may also be retrofitted to reduce earthquake damage. \n \n32.  Under the first project of the Facility (Project 1) 4 subprojects, representative of the type \nof infrastructure investments envisioned under the Program, have been identified and prepared \nfor the water supply, sewerage, SWM and urban transportation subsectors. These subprojects \ninclude the environmentally sensitive SWM component in Srinagar and the Bannihal Cart road \nexpansion in Jammu, for which a full resettlement plan has been prepared (Supplementary \nAppendix G). The process of identifying and appraising the technical, economical, financial, \nsocial, and environmental aspects of these subprojects will be adopted for all subsequent \nsubprojects. Detailed design and tender documents of these 4 subprojects have been finalized.  \n \n2.  Part  B:  Capacity  Building,  Institutional  Development,  Governance,  and \nInvestment Program Management \n \n33.  The capacity-building program will support the state\u2019s urban institutional and financial \nreform agenda with particular emphasis on developing the fledgling municipal corporations of \nSrinagar and Jammu into viable entities by 2015. The institutional development will develop \nmunicipal management capability including planning, budgeting, accounting, computerization, \nrevenue enhancement and e-governance. The key actions to be supported are as follows:   \n(i)  Strengthening the urban development and environmental policy framework for \nland  use  and  zoning,  slum  improvements  and  provision  of  basic  services, \nincluding human resource requirement. The outputs will clarify institutional roles \nand responsibilities, need for legislative amendments or bylaws, administrative \norders, and a framework for state-level capacity building, including support for \ntraining in municipal management and the formulation of options for reorganizing \nthe water supply and sewerage operations in the state; \n(ii)  Instituting  capacity  related  to  property  taxation,  including  the  amendment  or \npreparation of bylaws, a property tax cadastre, and application software as part \nof revenue management measures. Other actions include the empowerment of \nthe municipal corporations to revise property tax rates and tariffs, billing and \ncollection, and fund-based computerized accounting and audits;   \n(iii)  Strengthening  the  capacity  of  engineers  in  line  agencies  through  training. \nTraining  would  be  provided  through  the  Institute  of  Public  Management  and \nAdministration or similar local institution with the requisite skills, which would also \nbe strengthened with support from the Program; and \n(iv)  Mainstreaming  the  involvement  of  the  public  through  consultations  and \ndisclosure through seminars, workshops, and documentation of case studies, \nplus the use of local print media and web- and non-web-based newsletters.  \n \n ", "8   \n34.  Capacity-Building Assistance for More Efficient Service Delivery. For water and \nsewerage  this  will  include  assistance  in  creating,  in  each  of  the  two  main  cities,  a \nsemiautonomous entity or board equipped with modern operating and financial management \ntools and skills. The entities will be established as efficient, self-sufficient, and commercially run \nservice providers working under the overall policy direction of the municipal corporations, but \nindependent in their day-to-day administration from the corporations and the state line agencies. \nSupport will also be provided in exploring and developing options for introducing private sector \nparticipation in the delivery of services.  \n \n35.  Management  of  the  Investment  Program.  This  component  will  provide  funds  for \nimplementing the Program, development and updating of various master plans, incremental \nadministration  costs,  consulting  services  for  design  and  construction  supervision,  project \nmanagement and quality control, information dissemination, and the planning, appraisal, survey, \nand detailed design of the subprojects for the next tranche. The acquisition of office equipment, \nincluding  vehicles,  computers,  and  special  design  tools  and  software  for  design  and \nconstruction management, is included.   \n \nC.  Special Features \n36.  Urban  Sector  Governance  and  Reforms.  The  brand-new  status  of  the  municipal \ncorporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar,  the  first  elections  were  held  in  2005,  provides  an \nopportunity to develop the new municipal corporations properly from the ground up, thereby \navoiding some of the poor practices inherent in long-established corporations. The Program \ncombines physical infrastructure improvements with gradual reforms and capacity building. An \n8-10 year time frame is expected to be required before the municipal corporations can become \nautonomous.  This  long  term  approach  lends  itself  to  the  sector  loan  modality  and  the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) as requested by the state and the Borrower. \n \n37.  MFF (or the Facility): The Program will be an essential component of the larger road \nmap for the urban sector. Under the Facility, up to $300 million in loan funds will be made \navailable to J&K in tranches on a demand basis. Succeeding loans under the MFF will only be \nmade when proposed improvements have been properly appraised, designed and are ready for \nimplementation.  The  Facility  provides  flexibility  in  the  choice  of  the  eventual  components, \nenabling the state to mix and match funds from various sources with the demand, considering \nthe capacity of the responsible agencies to carry out O&M of the new facilities. Also, since the \nstate is new to major projects, the 8-year MFF approach gives the state time to develop the \ncapacity of the responsible institutions as well as to plan and prepare succeeding subprojects. \nMoreover, the Facility will allow the design and implementation of different tranches and the \nongoing loan to be appropriately staged so that overlapping of activities is minimized. The EA \ncan thus make the best possible use of its limited staff resources. The Facility also provides the \nflexibility of developing the towns as demand opportunity arises.  \n \nD.  Program Investment Plan \n38.  The cost of the Program is estimated at $485 million, including taxes and duties of $44.3 \nmillion. ADB will finance up to 62% of the total. Table 1 summarizes the cost by subsector. The \ndetails are in Appendix 3.  \n \n ", "  9   \nE.  Financing Plan  \n39.  To finance the Program, the Government has requested finacing of up to $300 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources through the Facility in accordance with ADB Policy9 The \nFacility will extend several loans to finance the projects under the investment program, subject \nto the submission of the related periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and the \nexecution of the related loan and project agreements. The Government has entered into a \nframework financing agreement (FFA) with ADB, which satisfies the requirements set forth in \nAppendix 4 of the ADB policy (please refer to footnote 8).   \n \nTable 1: Estimated Cost of the Investment Program \n \nTotal  ADB \nCost  ADB  Loan  J&K  J&K \nCategory   ($ million)  (%)  ($ million)  (%)  ($ million) \nI.

The specific terms of \neach loan will be based on the related PFR, with interest to be determined according to ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility. The Government has provided (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that it made the \nchoice independently of any communication or advice from ADB. The Government may request, \nand ADB may agree to provide, loans under the Facility through the submission of a PFR, \nsubject to compliance with the related policy and procedures described in the FFA. Each PFR \nwill be submitted by the Government in the agreed format. The Government will inform ADB of a \nforthcoming PFR at least 15 days before its submission. A PFR may cover several subprojects \nand  related  consulting  service  packages.  ADB  will  review  the  PFRs  and,  if  it  finds  them \nsatisfactory, prepare the related loan and project agreements. The Government has submitted \nto ADB the first PFR for an amount of $42.2 million. Succeeding PFRs will be for at least $40 \nmillion. \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2005. Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. Manila. \n ", "10  \n \n41.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Program Management \n43.  The Economic Reconstruction Agency (ERA) will be the EA of the Program. The ERA, \nas mandated by the government of J&K, is responsible for all externally aided projects. Policy \ndirection and strategic oversight will be provided by a governing body under the minister for \nplanning.  The  chief  secretary  of  the  government  of  J&K,  the  principal  secretary  for  state \nplanning and development, the commissioner/secretary of finance of the state, three sitting \nmembers of the state legislative assembly, and the chief executive officer (CEO) of the ERA  \nare the other members of the governing body. An executive committee established by the State \nshall be responsible to guide ERA on matters related to project activities. With the CEO of the \nERA as chair, the executive committee comprise of the following officials as members: the \nprincipal secretary for tourism, the public works commissioner/secretary, the housing and urban \ndevelopment commissioner/secretary, the secretary to government for public health engineering \nand  irrigation,  the  secretary  to  government  for  planning  and  development.  The  executive \ncommittee will make decisions according to the authority delegated by the governing body and \nwill provide day-to-day administrative guidance to the CEO of the ERA. Local level steering \ncommittees will be created in each city with representatives of the various line departments to \nfacilitate interaction between the ERA and the participating agencies, to select subprojects and \nreview  their  scope  and  design,  to  monitor  implementation  and  institutional  reforms  to \ndisseminate information, and to coordinate approvals and clearances among agencies. \n \n44.  PMUs in each of Jammu and Srinagar have already been established under the ERA for \nthe implementation of the ongoing project and the Program will follow the same procedures. \nEach PMU is headed by a full-time project director, reporting to the CEO. The project directors \nwill be supported by PMU staff comprising water supply, sewerage, solid waste management, \nurban  transportation,  financial  and  economic  analyst,  procurement,  social  development, \nenvironmental, and procurement specialists and project advisory consultants. A senior officer \nreporting directly to the CEO will be responsible for institutional development and capacity-\nbuilding activities. Another senior officer also reporting directly to the CEO will be appointed to \nensure compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies. Each PMU will have a \ndedicated financial and accounts officer to look after the project accounts and processing of \nclaims. The PMUs will be responsible for identifying, formulating, appraising, designing, and \nimplementing  all  subprojects,  including  compliance  with  state  and  national  statutory \nenvironmental regulations and ADB\u2019s social and environmental safeguard policies. Community \nconsultation will be an integral part of the operating procedure of the project. A total complement \nof 60 professional staff is estimated to be required in the two PMUs for the implementation of \nProject 1. The implementation and  tranche schedules are in Appendix 4, while the organization \nchart is in Appendix 5.   \n \n2.  Subproject Selection Criteria   \n \n45.  Only the 4 subprojects in Project 1 have been appraised. The other 20 or so subprojects \nenvisaged in the Program are indicative in nature. These will be finalized as the needs and \npriorities identified in the updated master plans for water supply, sewerage, drainage, solid \nwaste  management,  urban  transportation,  and  tourism  become  available.  The  eligibility \nrequirements for subprojects as detailed in Appendix 5 are summarized below: \n \n(i)  water supply, sewerage and drainage, urban transportation, and municipal solid \nwaste management subprojects in the master plan for the respective subsectors; \n ", "12  \n(ii)  designs and specifications incorporating earthquake strengthening for zone 4 or \n5, as applicable, and ready for tender;   \n(iii)  the subprojects will be economically feasible and financially sustainable; \n(iv)  the subprojects will conform to all national and state environmental regulations \nand be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002); \n(v)  the subprojects will include measures to mitigate any possible social impacts, \nincluding resettlement impact and impact on indigenous peoples, following ADB\u2019s \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998);  \n(vi)  all necessary national and state approvals and clearances are in place; and \n(vii)  ERA  and  the  asset-owning  agency  have  agreed  on  a  concept  plan  for  the \noperation and maintenance of the assets to be created under the subprojects. \n \n3.  Approval Procedure for Projects and Subprojects \n \n46.  Four subprojects have been selected and appraised under ADB\u2019s PPTA for Project 1. \nOther subprojects under the investment program will be prepared and processed as follows: \n \n(i)  ERA  will  prepare  preliminary  designs  and  cost  estimates  for  all  subprojects \nproposed under the respective tranches. ERA will prepare initial poverty and \nsocial assessments and checklists for (a) involuntary resettlement, (b) indigenous \npeoples, and (c) rapid environmental assessment, following ADB\u2019s Involuntary \nResettlement Policy, Policy on Indigenous Peoples, and Environment Policy, and \nsubmit to ADB for review and social and environmental categorization; \n(ii)  On the basis of the categorization, the ERA will prepare appraisal reports for all \nsubprojects,  including  an  appropriate  resettlement  plan  and  an  indigenous \npeoples  development  plan  or  integration  of  specific  actions  in  favor  of  the \nindigenous people in the resettlement plans following the respective frameworks, \nif required, and initial environmental examination (IEE) reports or environmental \nimpact  assessment  (EIA)  reports  as  applicable,  following  the  environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  developed  for  the  investment \nprogram, and submit these reports, along with the PFR, to ADB for approval, with \nthe endorsement of the Government. However, for subprojects categorized as \nenvironment category B\u2013sensitive or category A, ADB\u2019s 120-day requirement for \npublic disclosure will apply before the submission of the PFR; and, \n(iii)  The ERA and ADB will consult on PFRs before their submission to ADB. \n47.  The PFRs should (i) state the required loan amount; (ii) list the subprojects and related \nconsultancy support to be financed under the tranche; (iii) be accompanied by the appraisal \nreports  for  the  listed  subprojects,  including  the  environmental  assessment  report10 and \nappropriate resettlement plan and indigenous peoples plan, if any; (iv) give cost estimates and \ndetail  the  financing  plan;  (v)  spell  out  the  implementation  arrangements;  (vi)  confirm  the \ncontinuing validity and adherence to the provisions of the FFA; (vii) confirm compliance with the \nprovisions under previous loan agreements and the project agreement as appropriate; and \n(viii) provide other information required under the facility administration memorandum to be \nprepared and agreed upon between ADB, the Government and the government of J&K  to \nfacilitate the implementation and processing of the Facility. \n \n                                                 \n10 For subprojects categorized as environment category B\u2013sensitive or category A\u2013sensitive, ADB\u2019s 120-day rule for \nthe submission of the PFR will apply. \n ", "  13   \n4.  Implementation Period \n \n48.  The MFF will be implemented over 8 years as shown in Appendix 4 as an essential \ncomponent of the larger road map for the sector, through 4 tranches.11 The 4 subprojects in the \nfirst loan were selected because they are ready for implementation and are representative of the \ncomponents of the Program. The institutional and capacity-building activities in the ongoing \nproject, including the ADB funded specialist consultants will continue. The subprojects in the \nsecond  and  third  tranches  will  be  based  on  the  updated  master  plans  for  water  supply, \nsewerage, drainage, and SWM improvements and as land is acquired for new subprojects. The \nfourth and other subsequent tranches (if required) will focus on other municipal infrastructure, \nincluding components that will facilitate investment in important service sectors and industries \nbased on the economic development plans and capacity are developed in the regional towns \nand commercial centers. \n \n5.  Procurement \n \n49.  Procurement  financed  from  the  ADB  loans  under  the  Facility  will  be  carried  out \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). International \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) will be followed for civil works contracts costing $10 million or more. \nCivil works contracts costing less than $10 million will be procured through national competitive \nbidding (NCB).12 Single-stage, two-envelope bidding with post-qualification will be adopted for \nall ICB and NCB civil works contracts under the investment program. Works related to low-cost \nsanitation, public toilets, and restoration of structures with historical and tourism importance, \nand estimated to cost less than $100,000, will be evaluated individually for the feasibility of \ndirect contracting. Force-account procedures will be followed for specialized facilities (electricity \nconnections, railway and national highway crossings) by state and Government agencies.  \n \n50.  Water supply, sewerage, and drainage contracts may involve civil works combined with \nthe supply and installation of equipment or goods and will be considered as civil works contracts \nregardless of the proportion of costs associated with the equipment or goods. ADB\u2019s standard \ndocuments for procurement of plant will be used for such contracts. In procuring goods and \nrelated services, ICB procedures will be used if the estimated cost is at least $1 million and NCB \nprocedures if the cost is less than $1 million. For contracts involving specialized equipment, \nsuch as proprietary software and small materials, valued at less than $100,000, ADB\u2019s shopping \nprocedures may be followed. \n \n51.  NCB for civil works will use the standard documents for local (national) competitive \nbidding (civil works) and supply contracts will use the documents for international shopping \n(goods) already used in the ongoing project, as amended and approved by ERA and ADB. For \nsmall community works not exceeding $100,000 in value the option of community participation \nin  procurement  will  be  considered  as  per  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  The  contract \npackaging in the procurement plan was prepared on the basis of experience gained in the \nongoing project, which resulted in good competition. An indicative procurement plan for the \nProgram and a detailed procurement plan for Project 1 are in Appendix 6.  \n \n6.  Consulting Services \n \n53.  Consultants will be hired for project management, design and construction supervision, \ninstitutional development, and capacity building. In addition, independent agencies, institutions \n                                                 \n11 Depending on actual progress, up to 6 tranches may be required. \n12  The  state\u2019s  standard  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  being  followed  under  the  ongoing \nLoan 2151-IND will be used in NCB for civil works and supply contracts. \n ", "14  \nor  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  will  be  hired  to  carry  out  public  awareness  and \ncommunity participation programs and to facilitate and monitor resettlement. All consultants and \nNGOs  will  be  hired  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as \namended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for the consultancy services are in \nSupplementary Appendix A. \n \n7.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n54.  ADB Management has approved advance contracting for consultant recruitment and \nprocurement of goods and civil works, and retroactive financing for the Project 1 under the MFF. \nFor subsequent loans, ADB may agree to the request for advance contracting and retroactive \nfinancing of civil works and equipment and materials, and recruitment of consulting services, \nsubject to these being requested under the following PFRs and subject to being eligible in \naccordance with the agreed procedures and guidelines on a project by project basis. These \narrangements will facilitate the readiness of projects under the Program and will be considered \nfor subsequent projects during the processing of individual PFRs. Total eligible expenditure \nunder retroactive financing will not exceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan, \nand must have been incurred not more than 12 months before the signing of the related legal \nagreements. However, approval of advance action and retroactive financing does not commit \nADB to finance the projects being developed under the Program. \n \n8.  Governance and Anticorruption Efforts \n55.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended from time to time) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the ERA. ADB has assessed the financial management policies of the ERA \n(Supplementary Appendix B) and agreed on measures to improve governance, accountability, \nand transparency with ERA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, \nand transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any \nalleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support \nthese efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy will be included in all bidding \ndocuments. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Program shall \nspecify the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Program.  \n \n56.  In parallel with the physical investment, the investment program is also designed to \nsupport a number of initiatives to strengthen urban governance in the project cities. These will \ninclude (i) land use planning and formulation of an environmental policy framework; (ii) human \nresource  development;  (iii)  capacity  enhancement  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  municipal \ncorporations; and (iv) creation of a separate semiautonomous, self-sufficient, and commercially \nrun entity for water and wastewater services in each of the two main cities, equipped with \nmodern operation and financial management tools and skills.  \n \n57.  The ERA will ensure compliance with the specific anticorruption and governance risk \nmitigation measures, which are identified in Table 4. \n ", "  15   \n \nTable 4: Anticorruption and Good Governance Measures  \n \nGood Governance \nArea  Measures \nInstitutional  \u2022  deciding on any future investment in water, wastewater, and \nDevelopment  SWM sector on the basis of the priorities in the respective \n  master plans \n\u2022  regulating  building  activities  through  an  updated  land  use \npolicy and building regulations \n\u2022  establishing a separate semiautonomous, self-sufficient, and \ncommercially  operated  entity  for  water  and  wastewater \nservices in each of the two main cities \n\u2022  establishing an independent commission to set tariff structures \nfor water, sewage, and SWM \n\u2022  enhancing  the  capacity  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  municipal \ncorporations by: \n1.  computerizing their records and billing systems \n2.  converting their single-entry accounting systems to \ndouble-entry systems \n3.  imposing property tax  \n4.  expanding the tax network \n5.  improving collection efficiency \n6.  developing human resources \n\u2022  promoting  private  sector  participation  and  public-private \npartnership where feasible \nTransparency and  \u2022  regularly disclosing to the public physical and financial details \nDissemination of  and progress of the project  \nInformation  \u2022  awarding contracts and paying contractors on time \n  \u2022  undertaking extensive stakeholder consultation before \nimposing any new tax or revising any tariff rates \n\u2022  forming a public grievance redress cell within the ERA  \n\u2022  separating social and environmental compliance and \nmonitoring  from regular project implementation activities \nProcurement  \u2022  complying with ADB\u2019s guidelines on procurement and \n  consultancy services \n\u2022  using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and standard \nrequest-for-proposal documents \n\u2022  ensuring nonrestrictive bid specifications \n\u2022  ensuring maximum competition in bidding \n\u2022  advertising all tenders adequately \n\u2022  disclosing the results of tenders to the public \n\u2022  notifying the public about contract awards, costs, and \nimplementation details \nAudit and Quality  \u2022  having financial statements audited by external auditors \nControl  acceptable to ADB  \n  \u2022  stipulating, in all contracts financed by ADB for the project, \nADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nthe contractor \n\u2022  preparing a quality control manual for the project \n\u2022  preparing all technical specifications according to international \n ", "16  \nGood Governance \nArea  Measures \nbest practices and Indian standards  \n\u2022  adhering strictly to the bid specifications in implementing all \ncivil works  \n\u2022  adopting third-party inspection for quality control in all supply \nand works contracts \nERA= Economic Reconstruction Agency, SWM= solid waste management. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n9.  Disbursement Arrangements \n58.  Loan proceeds will be disbursed according to ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). To facilitate the implementation of the Program, the \nBorrower will establish an imprest account for each loan with the Reserve Bank of India. The \nERA may establish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) for each loan with in a current \naccount in a commercial bank acceptable to both ADB and the Borrower. The imprest accounts \nwill be established, managed, replenished, and liquidated according to the handbook. The funds \nfrom the imprest account will be transferred to the SGIA. The Government has assured ADB \nthat all transfers from the imprest account to the SGIA will be made within 30 calendar days of \nthe receipt of the advance or replenishment.  \n \n59.  The initial and all subsequent amounts to be deposited into the imprest account and into \nthe SGIA will be determined by ADB in consultation with the Government and the ERA, with \nparticular reference to the pipeline of awarded contracts. The drawdown will not exceed the \nequivalent of 3 months of projected expenditures or 10% of the total loan amount, whichever is \nless, and will be based on disbursements expected under contracts within the next 3 months. \nThe ERA will maintain each SGIA advance or replenishment in the separate commercial bank \naccount established for the SGIA, and draw from it only the portion of expenditures eligible for \nADB financing. Counterpart funds will be required for each such expenditure. ADB will provide \nguidance in the establishment of accounts for the Program during the loan inception mission. \nThe statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used in reimbursing and liquidating the \nSGIA  for  eligible  expenditures  not  exceeding  $50,000  per  payment,  except  as  ADB  may \notherwise agree during the implementation of the Program. \n \n10.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n60.  The ERA, through the PMUs, will establish and maintain separate records for works, \ngoods, and services financed out of loan proceeds. Also through the PMUs, the ERA will \nmaintain separate project accounts according to generally accepted accounting principles for all \nexpenditures incurred under the Facility and the subprojects, whether out of loan proceeds or \nfrom other sources.  The ERA will record in a transparent manner all funds received from the \nState, ADB, and other sources. \n  \n61.  Detailed consolidated annual project accounts, as maintained by the ERA through the \nPMU, will be audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of \nreference are acceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 9 months of the end of \nthe fiscal year. The annual audit report will include the audit of the imprest account, the SGIA, \nand the SOE procedure, and will specifically include a separate audit opinion on the use of loan \nproceeds, the operation of the SGIA, and compliance with SOE procedures and loan covenants. \nThe ERA has been made aware of ADB\u2019s policy regarding the delayed submission of audits and \nthe requirements for a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts. \n ", "  17   \n11.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n62.  The  ERA  will  be  responsible  for  establishing  an  investment  program  performance \nmonitoring system (IPPMS) acceptable to ADB within 3 months of the date the first loan under \nthe Facility takes effect. For the IPPMS, the ERA will first select a set of clearly measurable \nperformance  monitoring  indicators  relating  to  implementation  and  improvements,  and \ninstitutional development and capacity-building milestones including those in the design and \nmonitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  ERA  will  establish  baseline  data  for  each  of  the \nselected indicators within 6 months of the date the first loan under the MFF takes effect. After \nthat, the ERA will conduct annual surveys and will update ADB on the progress against each \nindicator. The EA will also submit quarterly progress reports in the format to be attached to the \nfacility  administration  memorandum.  The  ERA  will  submit  to  ADB  an  individual  project \ncompletion report and a facility completion report within 3 months of the completion of all ADB-\nsupported activities and subprojects.  \n \n12.  Investment Program Review \n63.  The Program\u2019s performance will be reviewed monthly at three levels by the ERA through \nthe PMUs, and quarterly by the governing council of the ERA and by ADB. The review of \nperformance for each month by the PMUs and the local steering committees will be completed \nby the 10th day of the next month. The ERA will review the performance every quarter and will \nforward the quarterly progress reports to ADB by the 10th day of the month after the quarter \nreviewed. ADB will review the quarterly progress reports during the review missions to be \ncarried out at least twice a year, and during the tripartite reviews chaired by the Government. \nADB will also carry out annual environmental reviews of the Program. In addition, a midterm \nreview of the investment program will be conducted in June 2012. The review will cover contract \nawards  and  disbursement,  implementation  progress  including  progress  against  institutional \ndevelopment  and  capacity-building  milestones,  social  and  environmental  aspects,  and  the \nstatus  of  the  IPPMS.  The  midterm  review  will  identify  problems  or  weaknesses  in \nimplementation  arrangements,  nominal  changes  in  scope,  outputs,  and  due  diligence,  and \ngenerate agreement on any changes that may be needed. \n \n13.  Project Readiness  \n64.  Recognizing that start-up delays have been a major cause of concern for urban sector \nprojects with new agencies, ADB approved an advisory technical assistance (ADTA) to support \nthe  ERA  in  implementing  the  first  tranche  of  the  Program  and  to  help  ERA  meet  ADB\u2019s \nrequirement for appraisal and preparation of the next tranche. The specific outputs of the TA \nare; a project management system, implementation support to the ERA, capacity building and \ntraining, improved urban planning, engineering designs and contract packaging, an operation \nand maintenance plan for Jammu and Srinagar, and improved public awareness. The TA has a \nbudget of $500,000, including $400,000 from ADB. The TA is not attached to the Program.   \n \n65.  ERA  has  also  requested  support  from  the  newly  approved  umbrella  TA  cluster13 \ndeveloped to improve project preparedness for new projects in India. The TA cluster provides \nsupport in planning, appraisal, and preparation of tender documents to ensure that a substantial \nportion of the works are ready for tender and award when the loan takes effect. A component \nTA has been provided to help ERA with project management, master plans for water and \nsewerage works, appraisal of the already identified 8-10 subprojects for the second project \n                                                 \n13  ADB. 2006.

Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n66.  The cost-benefit analysis of the 4 subprojects in Project 1 confirmed they are a logical \nsubset of the portion of the sector road map to be financed through the MFF. In addition to the \nphysical  investments,  the  policy  and  organizational  changes,  capacity-building  and  other \ninstitutional changes, were analyzed to develop a plan for adequate revenues to meet the O&M \ncosts in the mid term and operating cost in the longer term. These policies are as important as \nthe physical investments.14 Thus the economic analysis confirmed; (i) rationale for government \ninvolvement,  (ii) goals  of  the  plan,  (iii)  sector  development  plan,  (iv) associated  economic \npolicies,  (v) government  capacity,  (vi)  fiscal  impacts,  (vii) economic  risks,  (viii)  government \ncommitment, (ix) coordination of foreign aid, and (x) conditions attached to the loan. Details of \nthis analysis are in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n67.  The economic rationale for the Government\u2019s intervention is sound, as the Program \nsupports  local  government  functions.  These  primarily  deal  with  basic  public  services \ncharacterized by monopolistic conditions, management of externalities, and protection of the \npublic good. Subprojects are selected with the help of cost-benefit analysis/least-cost approach \nwhile still meeting technical and safeguard requirements. A comparison between the baseline \nscenario and the alternative scenario over the period from 2007\u20132008 to 2015\u20132016 shows that \nthe total fiscal burden in terms of the higher fiscal deficit that is attributed to ADB\u2019s project varies \nbetween 0.1% in 2007\u20132008 and 0.6% in 2011\u20132012 (Supplementary Appendix B). Despite \nassistance from the center, the state\u2019s fiscal position remains weak. \n \n68.  With limited tax instruments, an inadequate tax base, and unutilized non-tax sources \nmunicipal  corporations  are  highly  dependent  on  fiscal  transfers  from  the  state.  Funds  are \nprimarily transferred through the devolution of the net tax revenue of the state and grants. The \ndevolution of the state\u2019s net tax revenue to local bodies is a constitutional requirement (74th \nconstitutional amendment), and its magnitude depends on the recommendation of the State \nFinance Commission. As recommended by the first State Finance Commission, the government \nof J&K shares 10% of net tax revenue with local governments through block grants for general \nor specified purposes. Given the fragile financial status of municipal corporations, revenue-\ngenerating subprojects can only achieve financial viability over the medium term. Water charges \nare low and often uncollected and a property tax system does not exist, so resistance to sharp \nhikes in user charges and introduction of property taxes is expected, and the delivery of public \nutilities and services will continue to depend on government subsidies. \n \n69.  The financial analysis of sample subprojects incorporates this reality, and that J&K will \nreceive ADB\u2019s loan funds as 90% grant. However, the existing system needs to be reformed \nand the revenue-generating subprojects need to be financially viable against a benchmark cost \nof capital. There is no comparative rate-tenor combination to ADB; the closest market rate for \nmedium-term funds (10\u201315 years) is around 9%. The current rate of inflation is in the region of \n5%, implying a benchmark financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 4% for each subproject.  \nAlternative non-volume-based user charges and taxes have been worked out for the sample \nsubprojects on this assumption (Supplementary Appendix A). For example, at least a sevenfold \n                                                 \n14 David Dole. 2005. Assessing Aid for a Sector Development Plan: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan. ERD \nTechnical Note, No. 14. Manila: ADB.   \n ", "  19   \nincrease in the current domestic water supply charges will be needed to achieve the target \nFIRR. However, setting user charges or taxes at such high levels is not feasible at this juncture. \nThe strategy is to improve the recovery of O&M cost gradually by improving the coverage of \nhouseholds, changing illegal users to bill-paying customers, gradual increase of user charges, \nbilling and collecting from all consumers, reducing physical and administrative losses and make \nthe physical system more efficient, to enable recovery of O&M cost by the end of the Program.  \n \n70.  A set of feasible user charges and taxes has been proposed to cover 50% of the O&M \ncosts of a sample subproject by 2010-11. Key actions required to meet these levels of cost \nrecovery will include public awareness programs, detailed enumeration of consumers, creation \nof a property registry, computerization, establishment of a regulatory commission, and capacity \nbuilding of the municipal corporations. However, even with the levy of user charges as proposed \nand other arrangements to improve management of services and reduce losses, subprojects will \ncontinue to depend on government subsidies for O&M until cost recovery can be achieved \ntowards the end of the Program. \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact \n \n71.  According  to  statistics  from  the  Government  and  the  state,  the  percentage  of  the \npopulation living below the poverty line (BPL) in J&K is one of the lowest15 in the country. \nHowever, in terms of access to basic social services, J&K lags behind most of the other states \nas a result of limited investment and O&M funding. According to the 2001 census of India, \nalmost 30% of the population of Jammu and Srinagar lives in slums with poor levels of services, \nparticularly sanitation. Piped water is available to only about 8% of the populations of Jammu \nand Srinagar. However, the levels of services provided are poor, with only 1\u20132 hours per day in \nmany areas, at low pressure. About 40% of the solid waste in Jammu and 30% in Srinagar \nremains uncollected and is disposed of indiscriminately into local drains, streams, and rivers.  \n \n72.  An initial poverty reduction and social assessment undertaken during the preparation of \nthe investment program in the two cities indicated a considerable range between high- and \nlow-income groups. Of the 2,339 households interviewed, 5% comprised households living \nbelow the poverty line (BPL), earning less than Rs420 a month. The cities of Jammu and \nSrinagar both reflect a near-equal incidence of BPL households. The Program is not intended \nas a poverty reduction intervention, but it will contribute considerably to enhancing the overall \nsocioeconomic status of the BPL households in the participating cities and towns by improving \nand expanding the coverage of urban services, as well as indirect benefits through improved \npublic health, living conditions, quality of life, and economic opportunities. A summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 7. \n \na.  Gender \n \n73.  J&K  ranks  25th  on  the  Gender  Disparity  Index  (GDI)  with  a  value  of  0.740  when \ncompared with the national average.16 There are 900 females for every 1,000 males (2001 \ncensus). The state has a literacy rate of 54.46%\u201465.75% for males and 41.82% for females \n(2001  census).  Women,  particularly  among  the  poor,  and  children  end  up  with  the  main \nresponsibility in the household for fetching, storing, and using water for washing and cooking. \nThey  spend  at  least  1  hour  per  day  collecting  water  and  sometimes  twice  as  long.  A \nfundamental direct beneficiary of the water supply component will be the BPL portion of this \ngender group. The provision of sanitation and drainage facilities will also improve public health \n                                                 \n15 Government of India, Planning Commission, 2001.

HIV/AIDS \n \n74.  The statistics of the National AIDS Control Organization for 2005 show that close to 5.2 \nmillion people, or around 0.4% of the country\u2019s population, are infected with HIV. In November \n2002, there were about 24,000 cases of HIV infection in J&K (0.2% of the state\u2019s population, \naccording to the J&K AIDS Control Society), meaning it is a low-prevalence state with regard to \nthe disease. HIV is commonly found among migrant laborers, truck drivers, and security forces. \nGiven the current level of transmission of the disease in J&K, the AIDS Control Society in the \nstate has made it a priority to increase public awareness of HIV. \n \nc.  Indigenous People \n \n75.  J&K is home to 11 major tribes as well as a number of smaller indigenous groups and \nconstitute a significant proportion of the population in the Rajouri, Udhampur, Poonch, Uri, \nGanderbal, Anantnag, Daksum, and Kandi areas of Jammu. However, since the project is \nmainly urban, only a very limited number of indigenous peoples were noted during the initial \npoverty  and  social  assessments.  The  indigenous  peoples  households  covered  during  the \nsurveys in the project areas were largely assimilated with the local population.  \n \n76.  The  investment  program  will  not  hinder  or  adversely  affect  any  segment  of  the \npopulation of ethnic origin. On the other hand, it will benefit equally all persons in the investment \nprogram area. All subprojects under the Program, particularly those in the towns where there \nmay be some impact in subsequent tranches, will be supported by the indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan prepared according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People (1998) and the \nagreed indigenous people\u2019s development framework (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \nd.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n \n77.  The Program incorporates minimization of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement. \nOf  the  4  subprojects  appraised,  two  subprojects17 entail  land  acquisition  and  involuntary \nresettlement. RPs have been prepared for these subprojects (Supplementary Appendixes C and \nD) on the basis of an agreed entitlement framework in Appendix 8. Any RPs required for future \nsubprojects will be prepared according to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy based on this   \nframework. The ERA will ensure that, for subprojects involving resettlement or land acquisition, \nconstruction activities and relocation of affected people (APs) begin only after all APs have been \ncompensated according to the agreed RPs. If any changes made in the subproject design \nduring implementation affect other persons or alter the impact on previously identified APs, the \nRP will be updated and implemented in a manner satisfactory to ADB. All RPs under the \nProgram will be translated into the local language and distributed among the affected people by \nthe ERA. The RPs will also be posted on the ADB and ERA websites. \n \n78.  To  ensure  the  speedy  acquisition  of  land  under  the  Program,  a  high-powered \ncommittee18 will be formed at the state or ERA level for the independent valuation of land based \non its current market replacement value. The committee will also establish, on the basis of the \nprevailing rates, the transitional allowance and assistance to be provided to APs to restore their \n                                                 \n17 Municipal solid  waste collection and disposal site development in Srinagar, and  Bannihal Cart Road from \nShakuntala Crossing to the Children\u2019s Hospital, including the pedestrian subway, in Jammu. \n18  A similar committee has been constituted (see Government Order No. Rev (LAK) 92 of 2003, dated 24 April 2003) \nfor the acquisition of land for the Qazigund\u2013Baramulla Railway line through private negotiations.   \n ", "  21   \nlivelihoods to pre-project levels. In addition, the committee will directly negotiate19 settlements \nand  compensation  with  the  affected  persons,  wherever  required.  All  negotiations  will  be \nvoluntary and without coercion. The representatives of APs must participate in all negotiations \nto ensure transparency. Minutes of all negotiations, covering the key points of discussion and \noutcomes, will be maintained by the committee. The independent monitoring agency hired by \nthe PMU with ADB\u2019s approval will monitor these negotiations and their minutes. The APs will \nrefer the resolution of any grievance and disputes concerning the negotiations to the grievance \nredress committee created at the subproject level in accordance with the RP. \n \n3.  Environmental Assessment \n \n79.  Following the IEEs of the 4 subprojects and ADB\u2019s review, Project 1 was classified as \nenvironment category B\u2013sensitive, according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The most \nurgently required improvements and their readiness to proceed were considered in the selection \nof the 4 subprojects in Project 1. Based on their IEEs, 3 subprojects are category B, by virtue of \ntheir actual physical impact, but the solid waste disposal site in Srinagar is classified as B-\nsensitive.  \n \n80.  The subprojects in Project 1 will not have any significant adverse environmental impacts.  \nThe  ERA  will  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  PMUs  implement  the  environmental \nmanagement plans (EMP) developed as part of the IEEs are incorporated as line items in the \nrelated tender and contract documents. \n \n81.  Some subprojects in subsequent tranches may be encroaching on wildlife sanctuaries \nand other environmentally sensitive areas and may accordingly be classified as environment \ncategory A. Such subprojects may be developed after the master plans for the respective towns \nare completed and maps for wild life sanctuaries and forest areas are updated and available. In \naddition,  any  works  that  encroach  on  the  sanctuaries  will  require  that  ERA  obtain  all  the \nnecessary statutory clearances. Subprojects that fall under environment category A will be \neligible for financing under the MFF subject to ADB\u2019s prior approval and classification. The \nsummary  EIA  (SEIA)  or  summary  IEE  (SIEE)  for  A  and  B-sensitive  subprojects  must  be \ndisclosed to the public 120 days prior to submission to ADB for approval. No subproject will \nencroach on any national park or its buffer zone. If any changes occur in specific locations or \nalignments of infrastructure or project facilities after the IEE or EIA, or any new information \nbecomes available that have additional environmental impacts, then the IEE or EIA will be \nupdated by ERA and approved by ADB before contracts are awarded. The ERA will submit to \nADB twice-yearly progress reports on the implementation of the EMPs and the environmental \nmonitoring  carried  out  as  a  regular  part  of  project  implementation.  All  documents  on \nenvironmental  issues,  including  EIAs,  SEIAs,  IEEs,  SIEEs,  and  progress  reports,  will  be \nproperly recorded and maintained as part of the Program and made available to the public, \naccording to ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). Future subprojects will conform to the \nenvironmental assessment and review framework (EARF) in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n  4.  Risks  \n \n82.  Policy Risks. The state\u2019s economy is reviving after 2 decades stagnation. The municipal \ncorporations  in  Srinagar  and  Jammu  have  only  recently  been  formed\u2014the  first  municipal \nelections were held in June 2005\u2014and at this stage of their development are reluctant, and do \nnot  yet  have  the  human  resources,  to  accept  the  responsibilities  envisaged  in  the  state\u2019s \ndevolution plan and the related reform agenda. The city residents are used to almost free \n                                                 \n19  According to the procedure described in Government Order (Sadar E. Riyasat) 419 (SRO-419), C: Acquisition by \nPrivate Negotiation, clause 19\u201320.   \n ", "22  \nservices,  albeit  at  poor  levels.  The  newly  elected  councils  may  therefore  be  reluctant  to \nimplement consumption-based water charges and introduce property taxes. Water users may \nresist the charges and also hesitate to connect to the new sewerage network because of the \nhigher water fees that would entail. These risks will be mitigated by extensive awareness and \ncapacity-building programs, and the provision of better services which with an extensive public \nawareness programs should ease concerns. The implementation schedule takes into account \nthe need to first improve the available services before increasing user charges. The 8-year \nProgram will allow enough time to achieve the reforms.  \n \n83.  Location  Risks.  The  ongoing  project  has  experienced  some  problems  due  to  the \nrelative  remote  location  of  the  project  area.  Many  contractors  from  outside  the  state  are \nparticipating in tenders. Most people in the area and the Srinagar valley welcome the project as \na much-needed improvement of basic facilities and promoting economic development, and they \nseem to appreciate the value of ADB\u2019s requirement for transparency, open procurement, quality \ncontrol,  capacity  building,  reporting,  and  audits.  Nevertheless,  the  proposed  Program \nrecognizes  that  there  may  be  special  needs  in  the  State  to  counter  any  incidents  and \ndisruptions.  The  ERA  will  advise  all  consultants  and  contractors  to  provide  good \ncommunications, secure living and working conditions and location allowances to attract and \nkeep experienced personnel. The ERA will follow the quality-based procedure for recruiting \nproject  consultants  to  better  incorporate  such  considerations  in  the  contracts  to  avoid  the \nproblems experienced on the ongoing project. Similarly, the ERA will consult all stakeholders \nwhen planning and appraising new subprojects, issue regular progress reports in local-language \nnewspapers, and hire independent monitors as required to facilitate consultations, disseminate \nproject activities and benefits. The ADB-funded TA consultants will continue to support the ERA.  \n \n84.  Design and Implementation Risks. Experience on the ongoing project indicates that \ncompetent consultants may be better recruited individually rather than through firms and this is \nincorporated in the procedures. Firms may be hired through quality and costs or quality based \nprocedures. To reduce costs and improve efficiency the ERA may allow routine design and \ndrawings to be prepared in the consultants\u2019 offices outside the state.  \n \n85.  J&K  is  in  an  earthquake-prone  region,20 raising  the  risk  of  physical  damage  to \ninfrastructure in a major earthquake. This risk will be mitigated by requiring all engineering \ndesigns to meet Indian standards for earthquake-resistant buildings in earthquake zones 4 and \n5. The Program will also evaluate the viability of retrofitting public buildings such as schools and \nhospitals, to protect the life and property of the inhabitants and users of these buildings, as well \nas to demonstrate good practices in disaster preparedness to private sector builders.  \n \n86.  Safeguards Risks. Environmental and social risks will be mitigated through the use of \nappropriate filters as part of subproject selection and appraisal, as described above. There is a \nhigh degree of awareness of the need to protect the pristine areas and general environment of \nthe state, one of the reasons the State wanted ADB involved. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n87.  In addition to standard assurances, the Government of India and the government of J&K \nhave provided the following specific assurances. These will be incorporated in the FFA as well \nas the individual loan and project agreements as applicable, subject to any amendment to be \nmutually agreed on by the Government, the state of J&K, and ADB.  \n \n                                                 \n20 Seismic zone 4 and 5, according to code 1893 (2002) of the Bureau of Indian Standards, classifying regions on the \nbasis of their susceptibility to earthquake disasters.   \n ", "  23   \n88.  Technical. The master plans for water supply, sewerage and drainage, and solid waste \nmanagement will be finalized by January 2009. Structural designs will meet Indian standards for \nearthquake-resistant  buildings.  All  subprojects  under  the  Facility  will  be  selected  and \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  implementation  arrangements  and  subproject  selection \ncriteria (Appendix 5). \n \n89.  Good Governance and Anticorruption. The Government will ensure that the Program \nfunds are utilized effectively and efficiently to implement the Program and achieve its objectives. \nThe EA will ensure compliance with the specific anticorruption and governance risk mitigation \nmeasures identified in Table 3 and also summarized in below. \n \n1.  Institutional and Sustainability    \n \n90.  The state will commit to urban sector reforms in line with the principles outlined under \nthe JNNURM and the urban institutional reform agenda described in Table 1 under paragraph 5, \nto Schedule 3 of the FFA. The state shall, more particularly, undertake the following specific \nactivities:  \n \n (a)  Within 1 year of the effective date of the first loan, the government of J&K shall  \n(i)  establish a suitable institutional mechanism to review within 1 year of its \nestablishment  water  and  sewerage  costs  and  cost  recovery  options \nincluding the option of allocating a proportion of property tax collection \ntoward water supply and sewerage operations with a view to developing \nfinancial sustainability;    \n(ii)  commence  a GIS-based program  of surveying all properties and water \nsupply connections of Srinagar and Jammu cities, and complete the same \nwithin 3 years of its commencement; \n(iii)  enhance the O&M budget allocation under the State budget to address the \nrequirement of O&M of assets created under the Program; and  \n(iv)  issue  orders  requiring  all  property  owners  to  connect  to  the  sewerage \nsystem. \n (b)  Within 2 years from the effective date of the first loan, the state shall \n(i)  establish  semiautonomous  entities  or  boards  other  suitable  institutional \nmechanism  responsible  for  water  supply,  sewerage,  and  drainage \noperations for Srinagar and Jammu cities; these entities shall operate on \ncommercial principles and have their own independent budget, and perform \ntheir tasks in accordance with a business plan approved initially by the state \nand  the  corporations,  and  later,  when  the  corporations  have  gained \ncapacity, in accordance with budgets developed by the ULBs along with the \nservice levels and the water supply and sewerage charges that they will be \nauthorized to collect and retain;  \n(ii)  empower  the  municipal  corporations  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  to  collect \nproperty tax at rates within a range as laid down by the state in consultation \nwith the corporations; and \n ", "24  \n(iii)  complete a review of the urban planning and land use control functions in \nthe state and put in place policies that clearly demarcate urban land use \nplanning and development control responsibilities delineating institutional \nresponsibilities for development control and enforcement of penalties in \ncase of violations. \n(d)  Within 3 years from the effective date of the first loan the state shall   \n(i)  notify the jurisdiction of the Jammu and Srinagar municipal corporations \nto cover portions of the 2021 master planning area of the cities as they \nare developed and added to the serviced area;  \n(ii)  establish  modern  accrual-based  accounting  systems  in  the  municipal \ncorporations of Jammu and Srinagar; and \n(iii)   through a combination of increased efficiency of billing and collection, \nincreased  user  charges,  reduced  water  losses,  and  allocation  of  a \nproportion  of  property  tax  collections  to  water  supply  and  sewerage \noperations,  recover,  through  the  service  providers  in  Srinagar  and \nJammu, increasing proportions of O&M costs as follows: (i) within 3 years \nfrom the effective date of the first loan, 30% of the O&M costs for water \nsupply will be recovered; (ii) within 3 years from the effective date of the \nsecond loan, 50% of O&M costs for water supply and sewerage will be \nrecovered; and (iii) within 3 years from the effective date of the third loan, \n80% of O&M costs will be recovered. \n \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement and Indigenous Peoples \n \n91.  The  government  of  J&K  and  ERA  will  undertake  the  projects  under  the  MFF  in \naccordance with Government\u2019s and state government\u2019s laws and regulations, including its policy \non resettlement and rehabilitation, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the \nresettlement  framework;  and  will  ensure  to  the  extent  possible  that subprojects  under  the \nFacility  do  not  require  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.  If  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary  resettlement  is  required  for  any  subproject,  including  a  sample  subproject,  the \nGovernment of India, the state, and ERA will ensure that: \n \n(i)  The PMU prepares a resettlement plan for that subproject, acceptable to \nADB, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations of the state , \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy, and the resettlement framework \n(Appendix 8), and submits it to ADB for review and approval before the \naward of any civil contract; and proper consultation with the APs during \nthe preparation of resettlement plans, and disclosure of the resettlement \nplan  including  the  land  acquisition  and  compensation  process  to  the \naffected persons. \n \n(ii)  All  land,  rights-of-way,  and  other  land-related  rights  required  for  the \nsubproject are acquired or otherwise made available to the PMUs.  \n \n(iii)  All APs are compensated in accordance with the agreed land acquisition \nand resettlement plan before the commencement of civil works for the \nrelated subproject including any section-wise handover thereof, strictly in \naccordance  with  the  stipulation  in  the  related  civil  works  contract.  If, \n ", "  25   \nduring detailed design and implementation, any modification or additional \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts are identified, the EA \nwill  prepare  or  modify  the  resettlement  plan  (RP)  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy and the resettlement framework, \nand will seek the prior approval of ADB before the further implementation \nof RPs.  \n \n(iv)  The PMUs will ensure that efficient grievance redresses mechanisms are \nin place to assist APs in resolving their queries and complaints in a timely \nmanner. \n \n(v)  ERA will make available all the necessary funds in a timely manner so \nthat RPs are implemented and full reimbursement for acquired assets is \nmade to the APs well in advance so as to provide them sufficient time to \nmake alternative arrangements before the commencement of civil works. \n \n(vi)  Similarly, any adverse impacts on indigenous people identified during the \nplanning, design, and implementation of any subproject would need an \nindigenous  peoples  development  plan  or  the  integration  of  specific \nactions  in  favor  of  indigenous  peoples  in  the  RP  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples  and  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework, and the plan needs to be (a) approved before \nthe award of civil works and (b) implemented before the commencement \nof civil works. \n \n(vii)  A high-powered committee will be established at the state level within 1 \nmonth of the effectivity of the first loan, to acquire land through direct \nnegotiation  with  the  affected  persons  (Appendix  8:  Resettlement \nFramework). This committee will make independent valuation of land on \nthe basis of its replacement value. Negotiations, if any, will be voluntary \nand devoid of any coercion. The participation or representation of APs or \nother representatives will be mandatory in all negotiations. Minutes of all \nnegotiations covering the key points of discussion and outcomes will be \nmaintained  by  ERA.  In  addition,  the  committee  will  establish  the \ntransitional allowances in accordance with the RP and the assistance to \nbe  provided  to  APs  on  the  basis  of  the  prevailing  rates  to  restore \nlivelihoods to pre-project levels. \n \n(viii)  A  senior  officer  to  be  appointed  by  the  ERA  will  be  responsible  for \nensuring compliance with environmental and social safeguard policies. \nOne resettlement officer at each PMU will also be appointed to supervise \nthe implementation of the resettlement plan and the indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan (if any). \n \n(ix)  An independent agency or institution (that may include established and \nregistered NGO(s)) will be engaged by the ERA to undertake external \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  RP  (including  negotiated \nsettlements, if any) and the indigenous peoples development plan (if any); \nthat will also submit reports semiannually to ADB through ERA for review \nand disclosure in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy. \n ", "26  \n \n3.  HIV/AIDS and Human Trafficking and Labor  \n \n92.  The state through ERA will ensure that the civil works contractors under the Program will \nfollow all applicable labor laws of the Government and the State shall incorporate provisions to \nthe effect that the contractors will (i) carry out HIV/AIDS awareness programs for labor; (ii) not \nemploy or use children as labor; (iii) disseminate information at work sites on the risks of \nsexually transmitted diseases and HIV/AIDS, as part of health and safety measures for those \nemployed during construction; and (iv) follow and implement all statutory provisions on labor \n(including equal pay for equal work), health, safety, welfare, sanitation, and working conditions. \nThe civil works contracts will also provide for termination of the contract by the state or ERA in \ncase of breach of any of the stated provisions by the contractors. \n \n4.  Environment  \n \n93.  With  respect  to  environmental  assessment  and  compliance,  the  Borrower,  the \ngovernment of J&K, and ERA will ensure that: \n \n(i)  The Program is carried out and all project facilities are designed, constructed, \noperated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  compliance  with  the  existing \nenvironmental laws and regulations of the Borrower, the government of J&K, and \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and EARF. \n \n(ii)   Subprojects encroaching any national park or its buffer zone will not be included \nin the Facility; however subprojects encroaching upon wildlife sanctuaries or any \nother environmentally sensitive areas may be allowed, subject to ERA obtaining \nall the statutory clearances. \n \n(iii)   Each  PMU  will  prepare  an  IEE  or  EIA  report  as  required,  including  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) with a budget identifying the cost of its \nimplementation,  with  adequate  public  consultation  for  each  subproject  in \naccordance with the EARF, and submit it to ADB for review and approval before \nthe award of any contract. The EIA or IEE for B-sensitive subprojects will be \nsubject  to  the  120-day  requirement  for  public  disclosure  under  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002). Each PMU shall ensure that: \n \n(a)   all mitigation measures identified in the IEEs and the SIEEs, the EIAs and \nthe SEIAs, and the EMPs prepared for the subprojects, as applicable, are \nincorporated in the subproject designs, and are carried out during their \nconstruction, operation, and maintenance, and disclosed to stakeholders; \nand  \n \n(b)   if  there  are  any  changes  in  specific  locations  or  alignments  of  any \ninfrastructure or project facilities after completion of the process of IEE or \nEIA or any new information is made available during detailed design and \nor implementation that has an impact on the environmental assessment \nprocess carried out thus far, then additional environmental assessment \nwill be carried out by ERA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy \n(2002) and the EARF, and ERA shall take prior approval of ADB before \nfurther physical implementation of the subproject. \n \n ", "  27   \n(iv)   All  environmental  clearances  required  by  all  laws,  acts,  and  regulations  at \nnational, state, and local levels are obtained in a timely manner and prior to the \ncommencement of civil works for the relevant subproject;  \n \n(v)   If  any  future  project  includes  environment  category  A  subprojects,  then  the \nrelated  project  will  be  categorized  as  environment  category  A,  and  related \ncompliances undertaken in accordance with the EARF. \n \n(vi)   ERA will submit to ADB semiannual progress reports on the implementation of \nthe EMPs and measures under the IEE or EIA, and the environmental monitoring \ncarried out as a regular part of project implementation for review and disclosure \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005). \n \n(vii)    Appropriate budgetary allocation (including vehicles, material and equipment, \noperating expenses, environmental experts and other staff) is provided to PMUs \nto    fulfill  their  responsibilities  for  implementation  of  mitigation  measures  and \nmonitoring requirements as outlined in the IEEs, the EIAs, the EMPs, and the \nEARF, as applicable. ERA will design and conduct appropriate training programs \nfor environment specialists and project staff on topics related to their areas of \nresponsibility. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n94.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the ADB and recommend that the Board approve the provision of loans \nfrom  the  multitranche  financing  facility  in  an  aggregate  principal  amount  not  exceeding \n$300,000,000  equivalent  to  India  for  the  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Urban  Sector  Development \nInvestment Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as \nare substantially in accordance with those set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n   President \n9 May 2007 \n ", "28      Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms   \nImpact       \n     \nSustainable \neconomic growth  (cid:131) Increase in per capita real  (cid:131) State and National  Risk \nthough the provision  income in Jammu and  economic statistics  (cid:131) Commitment to urban \nof urban  Srinagar  (cid:131) GoJ&K Economic  sector reforms. \ninfrastructure  (cid:131) Growth in non-primary  Review \nservices and the  sector income in districts  (cid:131) Census 2011 data \npromotion of urban  encompassing Project \nmanagement  cities.   \nimprovement in   \nJammu and  (cid:131) Increase in investments in   \nindustries and trades  \nSrinagar, and \nselected towns with  (cid:131) Increase in tourist inflow. \ntourism potential in  (cid:131) People\u2019s perception of their \nthe state of Jammu &  quality of life improved \nKashmir.  \n \n       \nOutcomes      Assumptions: \nImproved living  By End of Investment  (cid:131) Census Data (2011)  (cid:131) Continued support from \nenvironment and  Program (2015):  (cid:131) The Second State  GoJ&K to devolve more \nemployment    powers to participating \nFinance \nopportunities for the  Increased population  institutions  \nCommission report \n2.4 million people  coverage of infrastructure \nliving in Srinagar,  services:  (cid:131) Municipal  (cid:131) Parallel development will \noccur in other key \nJammu and other    Corporation and \nsectors including power, \nDevelopment \nparticipating towns  (cid:131) 2.2 million people with  and financial \nAuthority Annual \nwith tourism  access to municipal water \nReports  (cid:131) State and municipal \npotential.  supply system.  \n(cid:131) Investment Program  corporation commitment \n  (cid:131) 1.0 million people with  to necessary institutional \nPerformance \nImproved capacities  access to proper sanitation  and financial reforms to \nManagement \nof participating  either through sewerage or  improve service delivery \nSystem (IPPMS) \ninstitutions in  on-site facilities with \nreports  (cid:131) Within 2 years of \nmanaging sector  access to regular septic \nreforms and service  tank / pit desludging.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a    Yes  Is the sector identified as a   Yes \nnational priority in country    national priority in country   \npoverty analysis?        No  poverty partnership    No \n  agreement?     \nContribution of the sector or subsector to the reduction of poverty in India: \nThe Program is primarily designed to improve urban infrastructure and services in the two principal cities of \nJammu and Srinagar and in selected tourist centers in Jammu and Kashmir state. It will also build local \ncapability to run and manage the facilities.  \n \nBoth Jammu and Srinagar have witnessed large-scale migration from rural areas, mostly driven by security \nconcerns over the last decades; consequently, the infrastructure is highly stressed. By providing urban \ninfrastructure and services particularly in underserved areas, the Program will improve access to services \nand contribute to urban development, the overall enhancement of the quality of life, and the reduction of \npoverty in the two cities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                           Targeting Classification:  General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nSample subprojects for project preparation were selected from each of the four major urban components\u2014\nwater supply, sewerage, solid waste management, and urban transport. Two of the four sample subprojects \nare in Jammu and the other two in Srinagar.  \n \nA sample socioeconomic baseline survey was undertaken in the two cities among a representative sample \nof 2,339 households. Eight-five percent of the households considered the Program beneficial and expected \nimprovements in the lives of the local residents. The rest felt that the Program would have limited impact. \nFive percent of the households were below the poverty line (BPL) with a per capita income of Rs420.20 per \nmonth and with limited access to urban services, according to the National Human Development Report \n(2001). This percentage figure is higher than the 1.98% mentioned in state-level urban BPL statistics. The \nincidence of BPL households is almost the same in Jammu and Srinagar. The mean household income of \nBPL households is about Rs2,000 per month. BPL households also considered the Program particularly \nbeneficial to them if implemented. \n \nThe overall direct benefits from the Program will come from improvements in basic service provision in the \nbeneficiary areas. Residents will benefit from improved living conditions, a healthier living environment, and \nthe prospect of improved health.  \n \nIn addition, the selection of subprojects under the Program is based on social and poverty indicators \napplicable in the urban context and on the limited access of the poor to basic urban services. The low-\nincome group with limited access to urban services stands to benefit from better access to better-quality \nservices.   \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes    No \n \nAs part of the initial poverty and social assessment study during Program preparation, discussions were held \nwith Program beneficiaries, namely, local residents, local resident welfare committees, and most importantly \nwomen in the communities. Particular attention was paid to ensuring the participation of socioeconomically \nvulnerable groups and BPL households in the process. Separate focus group discussions were held with \nthese groups to get their views and opinions on the Program.  \n \nAll these discussions were aimed primarily at (i) informing the communities and the people about the \nproposed Program; (ii) getting wider public input and suggestions from stakeholders on the Program, \nparticularly their priority needs with regard to the sector; and (iii) assessing the current role and functions of \nthe local residents\u2019 organizations.  ", "5 8       Appendix 7 \n \nThese discussions and consultations confirmed the need for the Program, with all socioeconomic groups in \nthe community responding positively to it. The key benefits of the Program, according to the stakeholders, \nare : (i) improved cleanliness and hygiene, and reduction in waterborne diseases; (ii) improved health; (iii) \nbetter services and less drudgery involved in collecting water and gaining access to other services, \nparticularly for women; (iv) less likelihood of flooding and, hence, reduced expenditure on repair and \nmaintenance of property; and (v) improved living conditions and a healthier living environment.  \n \nA community participation strategy (Supplementary Appendix F) has been prepared for the Program to \nensure the participation of the community (including women) in Program planning and implementation.  \nD.  Gender and Development \nAn attempt was made during the IPSA to understand gender-specific roles, status, needs, and problems in \nthe two cities through gender analysis. Attempts were also made to ascertain the gender impacts of the \nProgram  through  focus  group  discussions  with  women  from  different  socioeconomic  groups  in  the \nsubproject areas. These discussions were held to capture women\u2019s collective perceptions about social, \neconomic, and cultural norms and their access to facilities, and the results were further substantiated \nthrough participatory rural appraisal exercises.  \n \nThe improvement of urban services, particularly water supply and sanitation, according to the women \nparticipants, will have far-reaching impact on them and their lives. The women participants in both cities said \nthat the project would empower them by giving them greater access to services and resources. A key benefit \nthey identified was the reduced time that would be required for health maintenance and care giving, \nparticularly  with  the  water  supply  improvements,  giving  them  more  time  for  productive  endeavors, \nempowerment activities, and leisure. Better urban services, and particularly better city roads, according to \nmost of the women participants, would give them greater access to resources such as medical facilities, \nschools, and transportation. The indirect benefit of the Program to women would be a healthier and cleaner \nenvironment, thereby contributing to a better quality of life overall. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Description of the Project   \n \n1.  Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Development Investment Program (JKUSDIP) is \nunder  preparation  as  a  sector  loan  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  for  improving \ninfrastructure and municipal services in two municipal corporations of Jammu and Srinagar \ncities and selected tourist centres1 and other important towns, within Jammu and Kashmir State. \nThe Project will include investment in physical infrastructure plus proposals for capacity building \nand institutional strengthening of city and state authorities. \n \n2.  In order to prepare and process the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for \nsector lending, a set of four subprojects have been selected one each in each of the four major \nurban sub-sectors namely \u2013 Water Supply, Sewerage, Solid Waste Management and Urban \nTransport  in  the  two  cities  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar.  In  keeping  with  ADB\u2019s  sector  loan \nprocedures; this resettlement framework has been prepared to set out the resettlement policy \nand  screening  and  planning  procedures  that  will  apply  to  subprojects,  components,  or \ninvestments that are prepared and approved during loan implementation to ensure that they \nconform to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy. The Framework thus, identifies the broad \nscope of the project and outlines the policy, procedures for acquisition of land, compensation \nand other assistance measures for affected persons and institutional requirements for preparing \nsubsequent sub-projects under the sector loan.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy and Framework \n \n3.  The  resettlement  principles  adopted  in  this  framework  recognize  the  State  Land \nAcquisition (LA)  Act  1990  and  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  National  Policy  on \nResettlement and Rehabilitation, (Govt of India) as notified in February 2004 and the relevant \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policies and operations manuals, in particular the Policy on \nInvoluntary  Resettlement  (1995),  and  Operations  Manual  F2  on  Involuntary  Resettlement \n(2003).  \n \n4.  Following  the  state  laws  and  regulation  on  land  acquisition  and  incorporating  ADB \npolicies  and  operations  manuals  as  well  as  the  National  Policy  on  Resettlement  and \nRehabilitation, the basic principles for the Project will include the following elements with respect \nto each subproject:  \n \na) As a matter of policy, land acquisition, and other involuntary resettlement impacts would \nbe minimized as much as possible; \nb) Any land acquisition and/or resettlement will be carried out and compensation provided in \norder to improve or at least restore the pre-Project income and living standards of the \naffected people; \nc) Consultation  with  affected  people  on  compensation  options  and  preparation \nResettlement Plan (RP) in accordance with this Framework; \nd) Payment of compensation for acquired assets at market/replacement rates; \ne) Payment of compensation for lost land, housing, assets and resettlement allowances in \nfull  prior  to  the  contractor  taking  physical  acquisition  of  the  land  and  prior  to    the \ncommencement of any construction activities; \n                                                 \n1 The towns initially selected for consideration are Patnitop (Jammu region), Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonamarg \n(Kashmir region).

The RP prepared for the subproject will be used as a model for the preparation of \nsubsequent RPs. The RPs shall comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and \nother social safeguard guidelines. The additional full or short RPs will be disclosed to the APs, \nendorsed by the executing agency and will be submitted to ADB for approval prior to award of \ncivil works contracts for a subproject. The full RP, not just the summary will be disclosed to the \nAPs as well as uploaded on the ADB website after ADB review and approval.

The  Roadmap  and \nInvestment Program aims to improve the urban environment, public health and \neconomic opportunities for the 2.4 million urban residents in J&K. It will also \nindirectly  benefit  the State\u2019s  rural  population  of  9.6  million  people through \nimproved economic opportunities.  This will be achieved through expansion of \nbasic municipal services to meet the service standards of India in the State\u2019s \nprincipal  cities  of  Jammu  and  Srinagar  and  other  economically  important \ntowns, including several that have excellent potential for increased tourism \ninvestment by the private sector. The proposed Investment Program builds on \nthe  ongoing  Loan  2151-IND:  Multi-sector  Project  for  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation  in  Jammu  and  Kashmir.1  This  ongoing  project  is  limited  to \nrehabilitation of key urban infrastructure in Jammu and Srinagar and about \n2000 kilometers of rural roads to improve access and connectivity, but does \nnot  include  expansion  of  facilities,  except  as  in  the  normal  course  of \nrehabilitation.  \n   \nThe maintenance of existing infrastructure and expansion to meet the ongoing \npopulation growth has been inadequate. The State and the India have agreed \nto address these deficiencies through a major Investment Program based on \nthe 10th 5-Year Plan, combined with the 11th 5-Year Plan and the related road \nmap developed for the Investment Program as depicted in Schedule 1. Much \nof the proposed investments in water supply, sanitation and transportation \naccess will benefit the urban poor, who live without adequate water supply or \nsanitation. In particular, the sewerage and drainage improvements will improve \nthe public health in the lower income and poor sections of all participating \ntowns. \n \nDuring formulation of the proposed Investment Program there has been public \nconsultations and the proposed investments have the support of stakeholders. \nIn  addition,  there  has  been  extensive  policy  dialogue  with  the  State  line \ndepartments;  Public  Health  Engineering  Department  (PHED)  currently \nresponsible  for  water,  the  Urban  Environmental  Engineering  Department \n(UEED) responsible for sewerage and main drainage channels, Public Works \nDepartment (PWD) responsible for roads, the State Wild Life and Forestry \nDepartment, the municipal corporations of Jammu and Srinagar responsible \n                                                 \n1 For $250 million approved in December 2004. \n ", "2   \nfor solid waste and local drainage, the mayor and development authorities of \nthe other towns, as well as the various State agencies responsible for land \nuse, zoning, building codes and approvals, new area development , finance \nand revenues.

In addition, \nas in all urban projects in India, improved municipal administration, revenue \nenhancement  and  accounting  are  major  requirements  for  which  extensive \ncapacity  building  and  training  of  staff  has  been  incorporated  into  the \nInvestment Program.  \n    \nInvestment Program: \n \nThe total cost of J&K\u2019s urban sector development plan and sector strategy is \nestimated to be $2 billion, equivalent, over the period 2006 to 2026. The total \ncost of the Roadmap and Investment Program supported by ADB\u2019s facility, \nfrom 2007 through 2015, is expected to be $485 million, equivalent.  \n \nADB\u2019s support is intended to help finance the State\u2019s transactions under the \nInvestment  Program  described  in  Schedule  1,  subject  to  the  subproject \nselection  criteria  set  out  in  Schedule  4.  The  investments  will  include \nimprovements in urban infrastructure in Jammu, Srinagar and other important \ntowns. The actual towns to be selected for inclusion in the Investment Program \nwill be finalized once the State\u2019s economic opportunity development strategy \nand related master plans have been completed.

India\u2019s economy has strengthened substantially during the past decade and considerable \nprogress in economic growth has/is being achieved. Indian cities are the major engines of this \ngrowth, contributing to more than 60% of the gross domestic product (GDP). In Jammu and Kashmir \nState  (J&K),  the  State\u2019s  economy  is  primarily  dependant  on  services,  tourism  and  trade,  and \nagriculture. There has been a shift in the contribution to the State\u2019s GDP from the primary sectors to \ntrade, commerce and services. Considered gateways to the respective regions and tourist spots, \nJammu and Srinagar\u2019s urban agglomerations account for over 63% of the State\u2019s urban population. \nFollowing the recent reduction in disturbances in the State, tourist inflow has reached the 6.5 million \nmakr, and is projected to reach 22 million by 2020. With the resurgence of the State\u2019s economy, the \nmain issue is to manage urban and economic growth and for the newly established city corporations \nin Jammu and Srinagar to be able to meet their service delivery obligations. ADB\u2019s country strategy \nsupports the vision of the Government to improve the economy through infrastructure-led growth. \nThe State has already initiated improvements to basic services through the ongoing ADB financed \nurban and rural infrastructure rehabilitation project.8  \n \n2.  Recent improvement in the security situation and growth in tourisms provides the State with \nan opportunity to improve its economy further but this will require urgent improvements in the \ndecrepit infrastructure. The Central and State Governments are making a conscious effort to bring \nabout the much needed change. Immediate focus of the State Government is to develop the State\u2019s \nurban centers as engines of economic growth. To achieve this, the State has already passed the \nmunicipal act (2000) creating the new city corporations of Jammu and Srinagar, where the first \nelections for city council were held in 2005. The State now intends to improve the basic urban \nservices, particularly water and sanitation in these two cities, along with other important towns with \ntourism  growth  potential.  Concurrently,  the  State  plans  to  de-centralize  the  service  delivery \nmechanisms to the newly responsible city corporations. This will require building the capacity of the \nurban  local  bodies  and  state  line  departments  to  ensure  the  sustainability  of  infrastructure \ninvestments.  \n \n3.  After a detailed assessment of the existing situation of the urban sector in J&K, the following \nkey constraints were identified: \n \n(a)   Investments: limited due to disturbances, resource constraints, staff capacity and \nlack willingness of private sector investors to work in the State, and poor basic services, that do \nnot live up to the expectations of many tourists; \n(b)  Strategic.  absence  of  sector  policies  that  focuses  on  sustainable  and  planned \ngrowth, limited recognition of the importance of the urban sector in terms of its role in the \neconomy and the limited legal and institutional mechanism to achieve the sector objectives; \n(c)   Legislative issues: in terms of clarity in roles and responsibilities of institutions, \nrelated  powers  to  raise  resources  and  the  rules  and  mechanisms  to  govern  designated \nfunctions; and  \n(d)  Staffing. capacity to plan, design and implement programs, and operate and maintain \ninfrastructure. \n \n4.  Considering  these  constraints,  the  monopolistic  nature  of  the  basic  urban  services  and \nconstitutional requirements9, Government intervention is required for the time being, as even more \n                                                 \n8 Loan 2151-IND: Multi-sector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir, for $250 million, approved on \n22 December 2004. \n9 Water and sanitation are the obligatory function of local bodies ", "  11\nso than in the rest of India. The State has developed a sector road map to addresses the investment \nbacklog and the need for management reforms and capacity building, and for maintaining a balance \nbetween the two. As part of its longer term road map, the State is seeking financial assistance from \nADB,  in  conjunction  with  the  Jawahal  Nehru  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission  (JNNURM),  a \nGovernment of India (GoI) supported program for fast track, reform driven, planned development of \n63  major  towns  of  India,  including  Jammu  and  Srinagar.  The  road  map  also  contemplates \ndeveloping  a  market  for  private  sector  participation,  initially  for  O&M  of  complicated  sewage \ntreatment facilities and tourism related infrastructure. \n \n5.  Recognizing the importance of reforming the urban sector, the State has already taken  the \nfollowing reform initiatives: \n \n(i)  Amended the Municipal Legislation Act and introduced new acts for municipalities and \ncorporations (2000) and held city council elections in Jammu and Srinagar for the first time \nin 2005;  \n(ii)  Constituted the State Finance Commission to strengthen state-local body relationships and \ninitiate actions to devolve functions such as drainage, sewerage and water supply to the \nlocal bodies; \n(iii)  Initiated capacity building program for councilors and municipal officials through  state level \ntraining institutes;  \n(iv)  To overcome implementation capacity issues, promoted use of external experts for design \nand management of projects, as is being done for the ongoing ADB financed project, which \nwill be extended to O&M of services, and \n(v)  Developed capacity to plan, design and implement programs and cadre related issues \nmore specifically at the municipal level.  \n \n6.  Road Map for Investment. The State has prepared a medium term investment plan for \nurban  facilities  through  2014  and  a  longer  term  plan  through  2026.  Investments  in  physical \ninfrastructure  will  be  accompanied  by  a  program  of  urban  sector  reforms  aimed  at  better \nmanagement of services and formation of accountable service delivery mechanism and financial \nautonomy through transfer of responsibility and accountability for services to the city corporations on \na gradual basis from the current State line departments. The total investment program under the \nroad map is summarized in Table A3.1. The estimated investment requirements will be met partially \nfrom the ongoing ADB financed project, the State\u2019s ongoing \u201cplan\u201d expenditures, the JNNURM and \nthe proposed Facility financed by ADB. The Government will use the proposed ADB investments to \nimprove the public health, environment and economic opportunities of local people to help stabilize \nand energize the local economy and address social inequalities, especially in the poor and low \nincome sectors of the population.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n ", "12   \n \n \n \nTable 1: Investment Plan of the State for Urban Infrastructure \n($ Million) \n \nSub-sector  Estimated  State plan  Ongoing loan  Estimated  Proposed  Additional \ninvestment  funds for  (Loan 2151- cost of  under  Investment \nneeds till  urban  IND)  the  JNNURM  needs till \n2026  infrastructure*  proposed  2026** \n(including  ADB \nLWDA  program  \nprojects) \nWater  259.0  40.0 74.0 65.0 32.2  48.1\nSupply \nDrainage /  372.0  23.0 33.4 201.0 31.0  83.3\nSewerage \nMunicipal  35.3  7.5 3.6 16.0 8.0 \nSolid Waste \nManagement \nUrban  908.0  30.0   77.0 246.0  555.3\nTransport \nPlanning,  75.0  6.0   40.0   28.7\ndesign and \ncapacity \nbuilding \nSlum  150.0  30.0   78.0  42\nimprovement \n& poverty \nalleviation \nOthers  251.0  67.5   54.0 129.0   \nTotal  2050.0  204.0 111.0 454.0 524.2  757.5\n*Normal allocations for miscellaneous small works \n** Subject to State requirements and JNNURM allocations \n \n7.

Depending \non the speed of reforms, and development of ERA\u2019s capacity, the proposed 4 tranches could be \nconverted to 5 to 6 tranches. The key assumptions underlying the scope of each loan are as follows: \n(i) sub-projects which are in an advanced stage of preparation, including the 4 core sub-projects will \nbe covered by the first loan, along with master planning of the remaining components and capacity \nbuilding; (ii) the second loan will commence after the urban sector master plans for water supply, \nsewerage and traffic and transport have been updated and progress achieved on capacity building, \nimproved municipal administration and introduction of cost reflective tariffs and reorganizing the \nservice  delivery  functions;  (iii)  the  third  loan  will  commence  after  detailed  master  plans  and \nenvironmental regulations are in place for the development of other important towns and commercial \ncenters, and (iv) the fourth loan will finance works requiring longer preparation period.

Policy  Dialogue  and  Capacity  Building  Program.  In  parallel  with  the  physical \ninvestments, the State will move ahead with a number of initiatives to strengthen the capacity of \nJammu and Srinagar municipal corporations. Traditionally under the State\u2019s Development Act, 1970 \nprovision of water, sewerage and major drainage and urban roads in the cities and district towns was \nprovided through the PHED, UEED and PWD, respectively. The cities were responsible for solid \nwaste  management  and  local  drainage.  In  year  2000,  the  State  established  the  Municipal \nCorporation Act which when fully implemented will shift much more responsibility for basic services \nto the corporations. However, the corporations have only been operating for just over 1 year, with \nthe first elections for council held in 2005.  \n  \n9.  The  road  map  for  capacity  building  incorporates  strengthening  of  the  municipal \nmanagement in Jammu and Srinagar including: updating of property records and tax rolls and \nrecords of all users of municipal services, computerization of all  records, accounts, billing and \ncollection  and  development  of  budgets  for  O&M.  This  will  include  provision  of  computers, \nstrengthening capacity of departments, training of staff in city management and training of technical \noperating staff to improve O&M. The key aspects that will be set out in the Financing Agreement \nnegotiated with India and in the Project Agreement that will be signed by the State are summarized \nin Table A3.4 below. \n \nTable 4: The Institutional Reform Road Map \n \nObjective   Year wise outputs \nI  II  III  IV  Support from \nJKUSDIP  \nSector Policy    Draft report       \nprepared \nFormulation of urban  Water  .

Financial  and  Institutional  Criteria.  Sub-projects  must  demonstrate  financial  and \ninstitutional sustainability; this will be demonstrated by a 5 year horizon business plan that targets \n100% O&M cost recovery by the end of the Investment Program. The business plan must address \nO&M cost, sources of funds i.e, State support and user charges, O&M staffing needs and service \nlevel  targets  agreed  with  the  ULBs.  The  business  plans  must  also  describe  the  institutional \narrangements  for  implementation  and  handover  of  the  sub  projects  from  ERA  to  the  service \nproviding agency. ", "  33\n \n6.  Economic Criteria. The sub-project must be part of the overall master plan for the sub \nsector and it should have an EIRR of at least 12% or it should be the least cost technical option of \nproviding the particular service. \n7.  The project should have adequate arrangements to implement the project and the operation \nand maintenance team should be in place including financial allocation as part of the municipal \nbudget.  \n \n8.  Social Criteria. The subproject will, to the extent possible, not require land acquisition or \nresettlement (which includes the displacement of squatters or encroachers from the rights of way). If \nland acquisition or involuntary resettlement is required for a subproject, a Resettlement Plan will be \nprepared  and  implemented  in  accordance  with  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the  State \nGovernment, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the agreed Resettlement Framework \n(Attachment 1of Schedule 5). \n9.  If  any  indigenous  peoples/scheduled  tribes  are  likely  to  be  affected  significantly  by  a \nsubproject, an Indigenous People Development Plan (IPDP) will be prepared and implemented in \naccordance with the ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People (1998) and the agreed Indigenous People\u2019s \nDevelopment Framework (Attachment 2 of Schedule 5) \n \n10.  Environmental  Criteria.  The  subprojects  will  comply  with  environmental  requirements \nspecified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  2002  and  those  specified  in  Country\u2019s  environmental \nregulations,  including  legislations  and  standards  of  the  Government  of  J&K.  Environmental \nassessment of individual sub project will be carried out and mitigation measures identified during the \nassessment  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review \nFramework (Attachment 3 of Schedule 5) of the Investment Program. \n \n11.  Procedures.  Each  subproject  will  be  prepared  and  processed  in  accordance  with  the \nfollowing procedures: \n1.  For all  loans other than the first  \na.  Feasibility study, for all subprojects to be considered under the respective Loans, will \nbe conducted by the EA including its cost estimate. The EA will also prepare (i) an \ninitial poverty and social assessment (IPSA) and fill out checklist for (ii) involuntary \nresettlement; (iii) indigenous people; and (iv) an environmental screening; and submit \nthe same for ADB\u2019s review and categorization. \nb.  Based on the categorization and upon completion of the detailed engineering design, \nthe EA will prepare the appraisal reports for all subprojects to be considered under \nthe  respective  Loans  following  the  selection  criteria,  together  with  the  required \nattachments  i.e.  appropriate  resettlement  plan,  indigenous  people  development \nplan(IPDP) and environmental assessment and submit the same with form of periodic \nfinancing  agreement  to  ADB  for  approval.  However,  if  any  of  the  subprojects  is \ncategorized  as  environmentally  category  A  or  B  sensitive  subproject,  in  any \nsubsequent loan, requires compliance with the 120-day advance disclosure rule. The \nSEIA or SIEE must be circulated to the ADB Board and made available to the general \npublic 120 days before the PFR is submitted to ADB. \nc.  The EA will translate the resettlement plan in the local language and disclose it to the \naffected  people  and  incorporate  the  results  of  the  consultation,  before  ADB\u2019s \napproval. The final RP will also be disclosed on the ADB website and the website of \nEA. \n ", "34   \nd.  ADB will review the summary appraisal report together with the required attachments. \nIf ADB finds that a proposed subproject is not likely to satisfy the eligibility criteria \nand/or that the agreed procedures, ADB will advise the EA either (a) to modify the \nsubproject proposal in a manner that will make it eligible for approval or (b) that the \nsubproject must be rejected.  If a subproject is rejected, the EA may propose a \nreplacement subproject under the respective Loan.  \nf.  ADB will not approve any subproject, if all necessary approvals of the Government of \nIndia  and  the  J&K  State  have  not  been  obtained  prior  to  ADB  approval  of  a \nSubproject. The EA will be responsible for obtaining all such approvals and  will \nprovide ADB with a report showing that all approvals have been obtained prior to \nsubmission of subproject appraisal report.  ", "  35\nSCHEDULE 5 \nSAFEGUARDS REQUIREMENTS  \nAND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT POLICIES \n \n \n1.  India will ensure that all the requirements prescribed in this Schedule, which have been \nprepared with respect to the Facility and of which ADB has been provided full copies, are complied \nwith during the processing and implementation of the Projects under the Facility \n \n2.  Prior to  the preparation of each PFR, the applicability and relevance of each Safeguard \nframework for environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous people will be \nreviewed  and  updated  to  ensure  relevance  and  consistency  with  applicable  country  legal \nframeworks and ADB's safeguard policies, as amended from time to time. \n \n3.  In all cases, for each new PFR preparation, the Government will review on-going subprojects \nto check on the status of compliance with the safeguards plans and frameworks, and submit the \nreview reports to ADB, together with other required safeguard documents relevant to the Projects \nincluded in the tranche being processed. In any case if major noncompliance is discovered in the \ncourse of the review of on-going subprojects, a corrective action plan will be prepared and submitted \nto ADB. \n \n4.  In addition, all ADB Safeguards policies in effect as of the date the financing of a project is \nprepared or provided under the Facility will apply to such Project. \n \n5.  All the subprojects under this Facility will meet all environmental and social safeguards \nrequirement of India, the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and ADB as narrated in the following three \nsafeguard framework: \n \n\u2022  Resettlement Framework; \n\u2022  Indigenous Peoples Development Plan Framework; and  \n\u2022  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework. \n \n6.  Resettlement Framework. This Resettlement Framework has been prepared to set out the \nresettlement  policy  and  screening  and  planning  procedures  that  will  apply  to  subprojects, \ncomponents, or investments that are prepared and approved during loan implementation to ensure \nthat they conform to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy.  The Framework identifies the broad \nscope  of  the  Investment  Program  and  outlines  the  policy,  procedures  for  acquisition  of  land, \ncompensation and other assistance measures for affected persons and institutional requirements for \npreparing subsequent sub-projects under the sector loan.  \n \n7.  The  Economic  Reconstruction  Agency  (ERA)  of  the  State  government  is  the  Executing \nAgency (EA), of the Investment Program and will be responsible, through its Project Management \nUnits (PMUs), for overall strategic guidance, technical supervision, execution of the Investment \nProgram, and ensuring compliance with the loan covenants. The PMUs will be responsible for \npreparing  social  analysis  and  resettlement  plans  for  individual  subprojects,  including  updating   \nsubproject Resettlement Plans (RP) as per this framework and submit to ADB, through the PMU, for \nreview and approval prior to contract award for each subproject.  \n \n8.  The resettlement policies that apply will include India\u2019s National Policy on Resettement & \nRehabilitation,  J&K  State  Laws  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  requirements.  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary \n ", "36   \nResettlement (1995)  will guide identification of impacts and plans  to mitigate various losses to \naffected people by the various subprojects. The key aspects of the Policy are summarized below: \n \n \n(i)  Involuntary resettlement (IR) should be avoided or reduced as much as possible by reviewing \nalternatives to the Project; \n(ii)  Where IR is unavoidable, AP should be assisted to re-establish themselves and improve their \nquality of life; \n(iii)  AP should be fully involved in the selection of relocation sites, livelihood compensation and \ndevelopment  options  at  the  earliest  opportunity.  RPs  should  also  be  prepared  in  full \nconsultation with AP, including disclosure of RP and project related information; \n(iv)  Replacement land should be an option for compensation in the case of loss of land; in the \nabsence of replacement land, cash-for-land compensation should be an option available \neach AP; \n(v)  Compensation for loss of land, structures, other assets and income should be based on full \nreplacement cost and should be paid promptly. This should include transaction costs; \n(vi)  All  compensation  payments  and  related  activities  should  be  completed  prior  to  the \ncommencement of civil works; \n(vii)  RP should be planned and implemented with full participation of local authorities; \n(viii)  In  the  event  of  necessary  relocation,  APs  should  be  assisted  to  integrate  into  host \ncommunities; \n(ix)  Common property resources and community/public services should be provided to AP; \n(x)  Resettlement should be planned as a development activity for the AP; \n(xi)  AP who do not have documented title to land should receive fair and just treatment; and \n(xii)  Vulnerable groups (households below the recognised poverty line; disabled, elderly persons \nor female headed households) should be identified and given appropriate assistance to \nsubstantially improve their living standards. \n9.  All  affected  people  will  be  compensated  in  accordance  with  the  entitlement  matrix \nincorporated  in  the  agreed  Resettlement  Framework  prepared  for  the  Investment  Program \n(Attachment 1). \n \n10.  Each subproject will be prepared, and the detail design of each subproject will be undertaken \nby the PMUs in keeping with the following:  \n \n(i)  Social impact assessment surveys including 100% Census survey of the affected people, an \nasset inventory, landownership, usage and productivity assessments and data on the existing \neconomic and social condition of the affected people including a poverty assessment and a \nsurvey of at least 10% of the affected people and 20% of the seriously affected people, \ntogether with local-level impact data.  \n(ii) If impacts are found to be \u201csignificant, a full RP will be prepared  for each subproject for \napproval prior to award of contracts for that subproject; and  \n(iii) If subproject impacts are less than significant, a short RP  will be prepared for that subproject \nfor approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject.  ", "  37\n(iv) The RP would also include measures to ensure that socio-economic condition, needs and \npriorities of women are identified and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement \ndoes not disadvantage women.   \n11.  The  RP  prepared  for  the  subproject  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  the  preparation  of \nsubsequent RPs.  The design team will include resettlement specialist familiar with ADB policy and \nprocedures.  \n \n12.  The resettlement framework prepared for the MFF will be disclosed and made available in \nlocal language(s) during the public meetings at the community level.  Copies of draft RPs (prepared \nfor the subprojects) will be made available at the local level public offices such as revenue and \ndistrict offices to stakeholders for local inputs prior to award of civil work contract.  The summary of \nthe RP will be disclosed on ADB website and ERA website.  \n \n13.  Each  RP  will  also  outline  a  detailed  procedure  for  community  complaint  and grievance \nredressal.  All project related grievances will be redressed at the local level by Grievance Redressal \nCommittee (GRC) in a consultative manner with the full participation of all key stakeholders. The \nGRC shall comprise of members from the District Land and Revenue Department, representatives of \naffected people, including women and vulnerable groups.  Grievances will be redressed within two to \nfour weeks from the date of lodging the complaints.  All costs incurred in resolving the complaints will \nbe borne by the Project. \n \n14.  Detailed budget estimates for each RP will be prepared by the PMU which will be included in \nthe  overall  project  estimate.  The  budget  shall  include:  (i)  detailed  costs  of  land  acquisition, \nrelocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  and  improvement;  (ii)  source  of  funding;  (iii) \nadministrative costs (iv) monitoring cost (v) cost of hiring consultants (vi) arrangement for approval, \nand the flow of funds and contingency arrangements. All land acquisition, compensation, relocation \nand rehabilitation, administrative, monitoring and consultant cost, income and livelihood restoration \ncost  will  be  considered  as  an  integral  component  of  project  costs.  All  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement costs will be borne by the State who will ensure timely disbursement of funds for RP \nimplementation. \n \n15.  The independent agency/institution, (that may include established and registered NGO(s)) \nassisting in preparation and implementation of a RP, will submit monthly progress report of RP \nimplementation to the resettlement officer of ERA through the respective PMUs. The PMU supported \nby independent agency/institution (that may include established and registered NGO(s)) will conduct \nregular internal monitoring of resettlement implementation and prepare quarterly progress reports for \nsubmission to ADB. The reports will contain progress made in RP implementation with particular \nattention to compliance with the principles and entitlement matrix set out in the resettlement plan.  \nThe  report  will  also  document  consultation  activities  conducted,  provide  summary  of  issues  or \nproblems identified and actions taken to resolve the issues, and provide summary of grievances or \ncomplaints lodged by households and actions taken to redress such complaints. An independent \nagency/institution  independent  (that  may  include  established  and  registered  NGO(s))  will  be \nengaged by the PMU in agreement with ADB to undertake biannual external monitoring of the \nproject implementation.  This expert will submit its reports biannually directly to ADB.   \n \n16.  Indigenous Peoples. Since the MFF is mainly concentrated in the cities of Jammu and \nSrinagar, a very limited presence of IP households was noted in the socio-economic survey (SES) \nundertaken during the course of initial poverty and social analysis. No adverse impacts of the \nsubprojects have been identified on the IP households in any of the subprojects.  It would also be \nworthwhile to note that the IP households were positive about the subproject and did not feel that \n ", "38   \nthey will encounter any adverse socio-cultural or economic impacts as a result of the MFF. The key \nbenefits envisaged out of the MFF mainly comprise of a sustained improvements in basic service \nprovision within the cities of Jammu and Srinagar.  Indirect benefits will be available in the form of \nimproved living conditions, a healthier living environment and the prospect of improved health status \nof the population plus an improved economic climate with employment opportunities. However, in the \nevent of impacts on indigenous people, an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP) will be \nprepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  People  and  in  line  with  the  agreed \nIndigenous People\u2019s Development Framework (IPDF) (Attachment 2). \n \n17.  Environmental Assessment and Review Framework. The Environmental Assessment and \nReview  Framework  (EARF)  (Attachment  3)  of  JKUSDP  aims  at  (i)  determining  the  anticipated \nenvironmental impacts arising from subproject implementation based on an examination of four   \nsubprojects  in  Jammu  and  Srinagar;  (ii)  identifying  environmental  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental monitoring plans required to address anticipated negative environmental impacts; (iii) \nproviding formats and guidelines for selecting future subprojects based on environmental eligibility \ncriteria and conducting environmental examinations; and (iv) defining the Environmental Assessment \nand Review Framework for future subprojects proposed under JKUSDIP. \n \n18.  Though the proposed JKUSDP aims to improve the environmental quality of the urban areas, \nthe development of infrastructure facilities may potentially cause certain negative environmental \nimpacts. The implementation of subprojects can have adverse impacts on various environmental \naspects  namely:  (i)  topography  and  drainage;  (ii)  soil  and  land  use;  (iii)  surface  water;  (iv) \ngroundwater resources; (v) ambient air quality; (vi) noise levels; (vii) biotic environment; (viii) cultural \nand historic sites; and (ix) other socio-economic impacts.  These impacts may arise in the project life \ncycle either during implementation and/or during operation phase and in limited cases, may also \narise after end of operation period.  The potential environmental impacts are categorized into (i) \nlocation impacts; (ii) design impacts; (iii) construction impacts; and (iv) operation and maintenance \nimpacts. \n \n19.  The  SIEE  and  IEEs  conducted  for  the  subprojects  reveal  that  these  typical  urban \ninfrastructure  projects,  owing  to  their  scale  and  magnitude  of  activities  coupled  with  the \nenvironmental setting of the Jammu and Kashmir, are unlikely to have any significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts, except for the subprojects under MSW management component.  Based on \nthe IEEs of the   subprojects, all the   subprojects identified in Jammu and Srinagar under JKUSDP, \nexcept the MSW management facility at Srinagar, have been categorised as Category \u2018B\u2019.  The \nMSW management facility at Srinagar is categorised as \u2018B Sensitive.  The JKUSDP is classified as \nenvironmental category \u2018B Sensitive\u2019  in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002.   \n \n20.  ERA is responsible as through the PMU for (i) preparing a rapid environmental assessment \n(REA), an initial environmental examination (IEE) and a summary IEE (SIEE) of eligible subprojects; \n(ii) implementing the environmental management plan (EMP) and environmental monitoring plan as \nstipulated in the IEE; and (iii) maintaining records of all documents related to environmental aspects \nof subprojects for disclosure by the PMUs, and (iv) supervising the PMUs for the implementation of \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans. ERA will ensure that subprojects are properly \nselected. ADB will review and conform the environmental classification. if any of the follow-on sub-\nprojects is classified to be of environment category A, then the environment category of the Project \nis re-categorized to the environment category A, prior to approval of such follow-on sub-project. ERA \nwill further ensure that (i) environmental assessments for subprojects are conducted in line with the \nrequirements of ADB, and that of national, state and local statutory environmental regulations; and \n(ii) the environmental management and monitoring plans are appropriately implemented \n ", "  39\n21.  ERA is responsible for ensuring that all environmental assessment documentation, including \nmonitoring the implementation of EMPs, and environmental monitoring plans shall be systematically \ndocumented.  The environmental assessment documents are subject to public disclosure and shall \nbe made available, if required. ERA shall ensure that in carrying out an IEE for any subproject under \nJKUSDP, at least one step consultation with the affected people, will be done to gather their \nconcerns about the subproject, particularly in respect of its potential impacts. If an EIA is required, \nERA  shall  ensure  that  two  step  consultations  with  affected  people  are  undertaken.  The  first \nconsultation  aims  to  gather  their  concerns  about  the  subprojects,  particularly  in  respect  of  its \npotential impacts.  The second consultation aims to share the EMP with affected people and gather \ntheir views on the EMP.  \n \n22.  The safeguard requirements for each financing tranche, as well as the categorization of each \nloan for environmental impact purposes, will follow the approach and procedure defined in existing \nADB Safeguard Polices. For any subproject other than the four appraised subprojects under the first \nloan, categorized as A or B Sensitive, the respective SEIA or SIEE must be circulated to the ADB \nBoard and made available to the general public 120 days before approval of this subproject. If any of \nthe investments or subprojects in any subsequent loan requires compliance with the same 120-day \nadvance disclosure rule, the SEIA or SIEE must be circulated to the ADB Board and made available \nto the general public 120 days before a PFR is submitted to ADB. Environmental assessment reports \nfor ADB projects will be accessible to interested parties and the general public. The SIEE and SEIA \nreports are required to be circulated worldwide, through the depository library system and on the \nADB website. The full EIA or IEE reports are also made available to interested parties on request. \n \n23.  An Environmental Monitoring Plan will be prepared for each subproject.  The monitoring plan \npresents the recommended environmental monitoring activities which indicate the effectiveness of \nthe  EMP  in  mitigating  negative  impacts  identified  in  the  IEE.    The  plan  will  also  identify  the \nagencies/institutions  that  are  responsible  for  monitoring.  ERA  will  submit  to  ADB  semiannual \nprogress reports on the implementation of the EMPs and the environmental monitoring carried out as \na regular part of project implementation.  The environmental monitoring report will be made available \nto the public in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005).  The ERA has the \noverall responsibility to monitor the implementation of EMP, including the environmental mitigation \nmeasures for all subprojects under JKUSDP.   \n \n24.  ERA will with the help of the consultants, review the IEEs/EIAs and corresponding EMPs to \nensure that the mitigation measures and monitoring plan proposed are adequate and conform to \nADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies. ERA will provide ADB with access to information \non any subproject, as needed.  The information on the implementation of the EMP, as well as that on \nthe environmental safeguard compliance will be systematically documented and reported to ADB as \na  part  of  the  quarterly  reports  containing  a  section  on  the  implementation  of  the  EMP  and \nenvironmental monitoring plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "40   \nAttachment 1 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Description of the Project   \n \n1.  Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Development Investment Program (JKUSDIP) is under \npreparation as a sector loan from the Asian Development Bank for improving infrastructure and \nmunicipal services in two municipal corporations of Jammu and Srinagar cities and selected tourist \ncentres1 and other important towns, within Jammu and Kashmir State. The Project will include \ninvestment  in  physical  infrastructure  plus  proposals  for  capacity  building  and  institutional \nstrengthening of city and state authorities. \n \n2.  In order to prepare and process the Project in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for sector \nlending, a set of four subprojects have been selected one each in each of the four major urban sub-\nsectors namely \u2013 Water Supply, Sewerage, Solid Waste Management and Urban Transport in the \ntwo cities of Jammu and Srinagar. In keeping with ADB\u2019s sector loan procedures; this resettlement \nframework  has  been  prepared  to  set  out  the  resettlement  policy  and  screening  and  planning \nprocedures  that  will  apply  to  subprojects,  components,  or  investments  that  are  prepared  and \napproved during loan implementation to ensure that they conform to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy. The Framework thus, identifies the broad scope of the project and outlines the policy, \nprocedures  for  acquisition  of  land,  compensation  and  other  assistance  measures  for  affected \npersons and institutional requirements for preparing subsequent sub-projects under the sector loan.  \n \nB.  Resettlement Policy and Framework \n \n3.  The resettlement principles adopted in this framework recognize the State Land Acquisition \n(LA) Act 1990 and the entitlement benefits as listed in the National Policy on R&R, (Govt of India) as \nnotified in February 2004 and the relevant Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policies and operations \nmanuals, in particular the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), and Operations Manual F2 on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (2003).  \n \n4.  Following the state laws and regulation on land acquisition and incorporating ADB policies \nand operations manuals as well as the National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation (NPRR), \nthe  basic  principles  for  the  Project  will  include  the  following  elements  with  respect  to  each \nsubproject:  \n \na) As a matter of policy, land acquisition, and other involuntary resettlement impacts would be \nminimized as much as possible; \nb) Any land acquisition and/or resettlement will be carried out and compensation provided in \norder to improve or at least restore the pre-Project income and living standards of the affected \npeople; \nc) Consultation with affected people on compensation options and preparation Resettlement \nPlan (RP) in accordance with this Framework; \nd) Payment of compensation for acquired assets at market/replacement rates; \n                                                 \n1 The towns initially selected for consideration are Patnitop (Jammu region), Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonamarg (Kashmir \nregion). ", "  41\ne) Payment of compensation for lost land, housing, assets and resettlement allowances in full \nprior to the contractor taking physical acquisition of the land and prior to  the commencement \nof any construction activities; \nf)  All compensation and other assistances2 will be paid to all APs prior to commencement of civil \nworks.  \ng) Income restoration and rehabilitation; \nh) An entitlement matrix (Table-1) for different categories of people affected by the project has \nbeen prepared and provisions will be kept in the budget for those who were not present at the \ntime of census survey. However, people moving in the project area after the cut-off date will \nnot be entitled to any assistance. In case of land acquisition the date of notification for \nacquisition  will  be  treated  as  cut-off  date.  For  non-titleholders  such  as  squatters  and \nencroachers the date of project census survey or a similar designated date declared by the \nexecuting agency will be considered as cut-off date. \"  and \ni)  Special attention to vulnerable groups. \n \nC.  Procedures for Resettlement Plan (RP) Preparation \n \n5.  Each subproject will be prepared, and the detail design of each subproject will be undertaken \nby the PMUs in keeping with the following:  \n \na)  Social impact assessment surveys including 100% Census survey of the affected people, an \nasset  inventory,  landownership,  usage  and  productivity  assessments  and  data  on  the \nexisting  economic  and  social  condition  of  the  affected  people  including  a  poverty \nassessment and a survey of atleast 10% of the affected people and 20% of the seriously \naffected people, together with local-level impact data;  \nb)  If impacts are found to be \u201csignificant,\u201d3 a full RP will be prepared  for each subproject for \napproval prior to award of contracts for that subproject;   \nc)  If subproject impacts are less than significant, a short RP will be prepared for that subproject \nfor approval prior to award of contracts for that subproject; and  \nd)  The RP would also include measures to ensure that socio-economic condition, needs and \npriorities of women are identified and that the process of land acquisition and resettlement \ndoes not disadvantage women.   \n \n6.  The  RP  prepared  for  the  subproject  will  be  used  as  a  model  for  the  preparation  of \nsubsequent RPs. The RPs shall comply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and other \nsocial safeguard guidelines. The additional full or short RPs will be disclosed to the APs, endorsed \nby the EA and will be submitted to ADB for approval prior to award of civil works contracts for a \nsubproject. The full RP, not just the summary will be disclosed to the APs as well as uploaded on the \nADB website after ADB review and approval. In case impacts on Indigenous People are identified, \n                                                 \n2 While compensation is required prior to dispossession or displacement of affected people from their assets, the full \nresettlement plan implementation, which may require income rehabilitation measures, might be completed only over a \nlonger period of time after civil works have begun. Affected people will be provided with certain resettlement entitlements, \nsuch as land and asset compensation and transfer allowances, prior to their displacement, dispossession, or restricted \naccess. \n3  Source: Asian Development Bank Operations Manual \u2013Operational Procedure on Involuntary Resettlement  \nInvoluntary Resettlement Category A: Significant means 200 or more people will experience major impacts, which are \ndefined as (i) being physically displaced from housing, or (ii) losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income \ngenerating). Categories A projects require a full resettlement plan. Some of these projects may require a resettlement \nframework prior to the full resettlement plan. Involuntary Resettlement Category B: Not Significant include involuntary \nresettlement impacts that are not deemed significant and require a short resettlement plan. Some of these projects may \nrequire a resettlement framework prior to the short resettlement plan. \n \n ", "42   \nthen appropriate mitigative actions for them depending on the magnitude of the Project impacts and \nsensitivity of IP issues will be undertaken in the form of either preparation of a full Indigenous \nPeople\u2019s Development Plan (IPDP) or integration of specific actions in favour of the indigenous \npeople in the Resettlement plan for the respective subproject in keeping with ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous People and IPDP Framework.  \nTable A9.1: Entitlement Matrix \nType of Loss  Identification of  Entitlement  Entitlement Details  \nAffected Households \nA: LOSS OF LAND  \n        \n1.

Institutional Responsibilities \n \n7.  ERA will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the Project which will have Project Management \nUnits (PMU) for overall management and coordination. Established in each main project city, the \nPMU will have the primary responsibility of the preparation of RPs and their implementation. The \nDesign & Supervision Consultants (DSC) will assist the PMU in meeting the safeguard requirements \nas agreed in the loan covenant and preparation of the subproject RPs in keeping with the agreed \nResettlement Framework for the Project. \n \n8.  The PMU would ensure that RPs are prepared and approved prior to award of contracts for \neach  subproject,  and  for  monitoring  any  changes  to  subproject  design  which  may  require  re-\nevaluation of the need for and adequacy of the RP.  Independent agency/institution (that may \ninclude established and registered NGO(s)) will be hired as part of the Project for assisting in \nimplementation of RP. A Resettlement Officer (RO) at the PMU will supervise and undertake internal \nmonitoring  of  the  implementation  work.  A  two-days  training  and  orientation  in  resettlement \nmanagement  will  be  provided  to  the  PMUs,  Resettlement  Officer,  and  the  Independent \nagency/institution (that may include established and registered NGO(s)) staff before implementation \nof the RP by the Social & Resettlement Specialist at the PMU level focusing on issues concerning - \nprinciples and procedures of land acquisition, public consultation and participation; entitlements and ", "  47\ncompensation  disbursement  mechanisms;  Grievance  Redressal  and  monitoring  of  resettlement \noperation.

Valuation of Affected Assets \n \n9.  The asset valuation of the acquired land and asset will be done based on the principle of \ncompensation at the replacement value of the affected asset.  \n \n10.  Valuation of Land: For land acquisition through negotiations for the project, a High Powered \nCommittee (HPC)9 will be established at the provincial level within one month of the first Loan \neffectivity. The Committee will comprise of the following: \n \na)  Divisional Commissioner- Jammu/Kashmir province \nb)  Deputy Commissioner \u2013 Srinagar/Jammu province  \nc)  Secretary/Head of Department \u2013 Implementing Agency/Line Department \nd)  Collector ERA  \ne)  Representatives of the Affected Persons \n \n11.  This HPC will be responsible to make independent valuation of land based on existing market \nreplacement  value.  The  Committee  will  also  establish  the  transitional  allowance  and  rental \nassistance to be provided to affected persons based on the prevailing rates to restore the pre-project \nlevels  of  livelihoods.  Land  surveys  for  determining  the  payment  of  compensation  would  be \nconducted by the HPC on the basis of updated official records and ground facts. In determining the \nreplacement value of land the HPC will (i) appraise recent sales and transfer of title deeds and \nregistration certificates for land in subproject area and (ii) determine whether the rates established \nfor the Project are sufficient to purchase the same quality and quantity of land based on compilation \nof appraised rates.  \n \nF.   Disclosure, Consultation and Grievances \n \n12.  Each of the subprojects RP will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the \nstakeholders and will involve focus group discussion (FGD) and meetings, particularly with those \naffected by the Project intervention. In addition, a Public Consultation and Disclosure Plan will be \nprepared for each of the subproject. This Framework will be disclosed and made available in local \nlanguage(s) during the public meetings at the community level.  Copies of draft RPs (prepared for \nthe subprojects) will be made available at the local level public offices such as revenue and district \noffices to stakeholders for local inputs prior to award of civil work contract.  The full/short RP will be \ndisclosed on ADB website and ERA website .  \n10\n \n13.  Each  RP  will  also  outline  a  detailed  procedure  for  community  complaint  and grievance \nredressal.  All project related grievances will be redressed at the local level by Grievance Redressal \nCommittee (GRC) in a consultative manner with the full participation of all key stakeholders.   \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget  \n \n14.  Detailed budget estimates for each RP will be prepared by the PMU which will be included in \nthe  overall  project  estimate.  The  budget  shall  include:  (i)  detailed  costs  of  land  acquisition, \n                                                 \n9 A similar Committee has been constituted vide Government order No. \u2013 Rev (LAK) 92 of 2003, dated 24 April 2003, for the purpose of \nacquisition of land for Qazigund-Baramulla Railway line through Private negotiations.   \n10 The ERA website is presently under construction. \n ", "48   \nrelocation,  and  livelihood  and  income  restoration  and  improvement;  (ii)  source  of  funding;  (iii) \nadministrative costs (iv) monitoring cost (v) cost of hiring consultants (vi) arrangement for approval, \nand the flow of funds and contingency arrangements.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n16.  The  Independent agency/institution (that may include established and registered NGO(s)), \nassisting in preparation and implementation of a RP, will submit monthly progress report of RP \nimplementation to the ERA through the respective PMU.  The PMU will conduct regular internal \nmonitoring of resettlement implementation and prepare quarterly progress reports for submission to \nADB.  The reports will contain progress made in RP implementation with particular attention to \ncompliance with the principles and entitlement matrix set out in the resettlement plan.  The report will \nalso document consultation activities conducted, provide summary of issues or problems identified \nand actions taken to resolve the issues, and provide summary of grievances or complaints lodged by \nhouseholds and actions taken to redress such complaints.  \n \n17.  An Independent agency/institution (that may include established and registered NGO(s))will \nbe engaged by the PMU in agreement with ADB to undertake biannual external monitoring of the \nproject  implementation.

Project Introduction \n1.  Jammu and Kashmir Urban Development Sector Project (JKUDSP) is under preparation for \nsector loan funding from the Asian Development Bank for improving infrastructure and municipal \nservices in two municipal corporations and selected tourist centres within Jammu and Kashmir State.  \nThe two cities are Jammu and Srinagar.  The tourist centres and other important towns initially \nselected for consideration are Patnitop (Jammu region), Gulmarg, Pahalgam and Sonmarg (Kashmir \nregion).  The project will include investment in physical infrastructure plus proposals for capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening of city and state authorities. \n2.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s procedure for sector lending, a set of four sample subprojects have \nbeen selected in the two Project cities of Srinagar & Jammu for project preparation and processing \nin  each  of  the  four  major  urban  sub-sectors  namely  \u2013  Water  Supply,  Sewerage,  Solid  Waste \nManagement, and Urban Transport.  Out of these four sample subprojects, two sample subprojects \nhave been selected in Jammu city and two sample subprojects in Srinagar City. \n3.  Since the Project is mainly concentrated in the cities of Jammu and Srinagar, a very limited \npresence of IP households was noted in the socio-economic survey (SES) undertaken during the \ncourse of initial poverty and social analysis. No adverse impacts of the subprojects have been \nidentified on the IP households in any of the sample subprojects.  It would also be worthwhile to note \nthat the IP households were positive about the subproject and did not feel that they will encounter \nany  adverse  socio-cultural  or  economic  impacts  as  a  result  of  the  Project.  The  key  benefits \nenvisaged out of the Project mainly comprise of a sustained improvements in basic service provision \nwithin the cities of Jammu and Srinagar and other important towns.  Indirect benefits will be available \nin the form of improved living conditions, a healthier living environment and the prospect of improved \nhealth status of the population plus an improved economic climate with employment opportunities.  \n4.  Nonetheless, this Indigenous Peoples Development Framework (IPDF) is intended to guide \nselection and preparation of additional subprojects under the Project where impacts on tribal people \nare identified to ensure better distribution of the Project benefits and promote development of the \nindigenous peoples in the Project areas.  The framework is prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nprocedures for sector loans as presented in ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nB.  Indigenous/Tribal Groups \n5.  The terms \u2018indigenous peoples\u2019, indigenous ethnic minorities\u2019, tribal groups,\u2019 and \u2018scheduled \ntribes\u2019 describe social groups with a social and cultural identity distinct from the dominant society that \nmakes them vulnerable to being disadvantaged in the development process.  By definition, IP refers \nto peoples living in an area within a nation-state, prior to the formation of a nation-state, but who do \nnot  identify  with  the  dominant  nation.    This  group  has  social,  cultural,  economic,  and  political \ntraditions and institutions distinct from the mainstream or dominant society and culture.   \n6.  ADB  uses  the  following  characteristics  to  define  indigenous  people:  (i)  descent  from \npopulation groups present in a given area before territories were defined; (ii) maintenance of cultural \nand  social  identities  separate  from  dominant  societies  and  cultures;  (iii)  self  identification  and \nidentification by others as being part of a distinct cultural group; (iv) linguistic identity different from \n ", "50   \nthat of dominant society; (v) social, cultural, economic and political traditions and institutions distinct \nfrom dominant culture; (vi) economic systems oriented more towards traditional production systems \nrather than mainstream; and (vii) unique ties and attachments to traditional habitats and ancestral \nterritories.  Essentially,  indigenous  people  have  a  social  and  cultural  identity  distinct  from  the \nmainstream society that makes them vulnerable to being overlooked in development processes. \n \nC.  Indigenous Peoples Development Framework Objectives \n9.  The Indigenous Peoples Development Framework seeks to ensure that indigenous people \nand  tribal  communities  are  informed,  consulted  and  mobilized  to  participate  in  the  subproject \npreparation. The Framework is intended to guide selection and preparation of additional subprojects \nunder the Project where impacts on tribal people are identified to ensure better distribution of the \nProject benefits and promote development of the indigenous peoples in the Project areas.  The \nframework is prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s procedures for sector loans as presented in ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n \nD.  IPDP Policy Framework \n10.  ADB's Policy on Indigenous People (IPs) aims to protect ethnic minorities from the adverse \nimpact of development, and to ensure that ethnic minorities benefit from development projects and \nprograms.  The need for a full IPDP will depend on the nature and magnitude of the Project impacts \nand sensitivity of IP issues.  The need for the IPDP will be established on the basis of the following \ncriteria set out in ADB\u2019s Policy on IP, to determine if project impacts are \u2018significant\u2019:  \n(i) adverse impacts on customary rights of use and access to land & natural resources;  \n(ii) negative impacts on socio-economic status and cultural identity;  \n(iii) impacts on health, education, livelihood and social security status; and \n(iv) any other impacts that may alter or undermine indigenous knowledge and customary \ninstitutions.  \n11.  The IPDP will ensure that project affected IPs are, as well off with the project as without it \nafter the implementation of the plan. This plan will also aim to identify measures towards satisfying \nthe needs and developmental aspirations of IPs. \n12.  If, the impacts on IP\u2019s are insignificant11, then specific actions in favour of the indigenous \npeople will need to be integrated in the Resettlement Plan for the subprojects or a community / tribal \ndevelopment plan. This would ensure appropriate mitigations and benefits for the indigenous people.  \n13.  Based on both India\u2019s legal, constitutional and developmental strategies and ADB\u2019s policy on \nindigenous people, the objectives of an IPDP will be as follows: \n(i)  Ensure that tribal/ST people affected by any subproject will benefit from the subproject;  \n                                                 \n11  Impacts  are  insignificant  when  the  fewer  than  100  Indigenous  People  are  affected,  a  full  Indigenous  Peoples \nDevelopment Plan (IPDP) is not required but impacts and mitigation measures can be dealt through the RP. Impacts are \nconsidered to be \u2018significant\u2019 when more than 100 Indigenous People are affected by the Project thereby requiring a \nseparate IPDP.   ", "  51\n(ii) Ensure tribal inclusion in the entire process of planning, implementation and monitoring of \nthe subproject;  \n(iii) Ensure that the benefits of the subprojects are available to STs/SCs more than or at least \nat par with other affected groups; this may require giving preference to tribal people as \nvulnerable groups over others on certain benefits under the subprojects; and \n(iv) Provide a base for the tribal groups in the area to receive adequate development focus \nand attention. \n \nE.  Procedure for Preparing an IPDP \n14.  In order to prepare an IPDP the following steps will be undertaken: \n(i)  Based  on  the  social  assessment,  establish  baseline  data  on  the  tribal  people  \n(subsistence, employment, community networks) affected by the project (use the criteria in \nthe section above to determine project impacts); \n(ii) Review policy guidelines both at national and state level regarding STs; \n(iii) If the impacts are considered significant as defined above, prepare an IPDP based on \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous People; \n(iv) Submit IPDP to ADB for review and approval. \n \n15.  As enumerated above, the main features of the IPDP will thus comprise of a preliminary \nscreening process, followed by a social impact assessment to determine the degree and nature of \nimpact of each subproject, and an action plan will be developed if warranted.  Each of these steps \nhave been further elucidated in the sections below: \n1.   Screening \n16.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  and  Design  &  Supervision  Consultants  (DSC) \nresponsible for subproject preparation and implementation will visit all tribal settlements near the \nsubproject areas or in likelihood of being affected and influenced by the subproject components.  \nPublic meetings will be arranged in selected tribal communities by the PMU and DSC to provide \nthem information about the subproject and take their views on the subproject. \n17.  During this visit, the social specialist of the DSC and PMU will undertake a screening of the \ntribal communities with the help of the community leaders and local authorities. The screening will \ncover the following aspects: \n(i)  Name(s) of tribal community group(s) in the area; \n(ii) Total number of tribal community groups in the area; \n(iii) Percentage of tribal community population to that of total area/locality population; \n(iv) Number and percentage of tribal community households along the zone of influence of \nthe proposed subproject. \n ", "52   \n18.  If the results of the screening bring forth the presence of tribal community households in the \nzone of influence of the proposed subproject, a social impact assessment will be planned for those \nareas. \n \n2.  Social Impact Assessment \n19.  The DSC and PMU will undertake a social impact assessment (SIA).  The SIA will gather \nrelevant  information  on  demographic  data;  social,  cultural  and  economic  situation;  and  social, \ncultural and economic impacts \u2013 positive and negative on the tribal communities in the subproject \narea. \n20.  Information  will  be  gathered  from  separate  group  meetings  within  the  tribal  community, \nincluding tribal leaders; group of tribal men and women, especially those who live in the zone of \ninfluence of the proposed subproject under the Project.  Discussions will focus on the positive and \nnegative impacts of the subproject as well as recommendations on the design of the subproject.  \nThe PMU and the DSC will be responsible for analyzing the SIA and based on it developing an \naction plan with the tribal community leaders.  If the SIA indicates that the potential impact of the \nproposed Project will be significantly adverse threatening the cultural practices and their source of \nlivelihood, the PMU and DSC will consider other design options to minimize such adverse impacts \nand will prepare an Indigenous Peoples Development Plan (IPDP). \n \n3.   Indigenous People Development Plan \n21.  IPDP will consist of a number of activities and will include mitigation measures of potentially \nnegative  impacts  by  means  of  modification  of  subproject  design  and  development  assistance.  \nWhere there is land acquisition in tribal communities, the Project will ensure that their rights will not \nbe violated and that they will be compensated for the use of any part of their land in a manner that is \nculturally  acceptable  to  them.  The  compensation will  be in  keeping with  Entitlement  Matrix  as \nprovided in the Resettlement Framework of the Project.  The IPDP will include: \n(i) Baseline data; \n(ii) Land tenure information; \n(iii) Local participation; \n(iv)Technical identification of development or mitigation activities; \n(v) Institutional arrangement; \n(vi) Implementation schedule; \n(vii) Monitoring and evaluation; and \n(viii) Cost estimate and financing plan. \n22.  The PMU will submit the IPDP through the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) to ADB for review \nand approval prior to the selection of specific subprojects.  The IPDP policy and measures must \ncomply with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples. \n \nF.  Consultation & Disclosure  \n \n23.  The tribal groups/IP will be consulted during the preparation of the IPDP.  They will be \ninformed of the mitigation measures proposed and their views will be taken into account in finalizing \nthe plan.  The Plan will be translated into the tribal language and made available to the affected \npeople before implementation. The disclosure will be in a manner accessible to APs where there are \ndiffering levels of literacy skills.  ", "  53\n24.  The  tribal  institutions  and  organizations  in  the  affected  area  will  also  be  involved  in \nimplementing the IPDP and in resolving any disputes that may arise.  \n \nG.  Institutional Framework and Budget \n25.  ERA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  (EA)  for  the  Project  which  will  have  two  Project \nManagement Units (PMU) headed by a Regional Director each in the city of Jammu & Srinagar, \nreporting to the CEO. The PMU will have the primary responsibility for the preparation of the IPDP \nsupported by DSC.  The responsibility of financing, implementation and monitoring of the IPDP will \nrest with the EA.  A local NGO/institution with the relevant experience will be hired to assist the \nPMUs in planning and implementing the IPDP.  The  independent agency/institution (that may \ninclude established and registered NGO(s))will be fully oriented on ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople. \n \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n26.  The  PMU  will  set  up  an  internal  monitoring  system  comprising  Social  Development  & \nResettlement Specialist, independent agency/institution (that may include established and registered \nNGO(s)),  tribal  people/IP  and  their  institutions  to  monitor  the  plan  implementation.    Monitoring \nindicators  will  be  established.  In  addition,  an  external  independent  monitoring  agency  will  be \nengaged by the EA with ADB concurrence to undertake independent external monitoring of the Plan.  \nReporting / monitoring formats will be prepared for both internal and external monitoring. \n \n27.  Any IPDPs prepared under this Project will be endorsed by the EA before sending to ADB for \nfinal approval. \n \n \n ", "54   \n \nAttachment 3 \nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW FRAMEWORK \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is preparing the Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector \nDevelopment Project (JKUSDP) as a sector loan with multitranche financing facility. The summary \ninitial environmental examination (SIEE) for JKUSDP has been completed. Due consideration has \nbeen given to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (EAG) \n(2003),  Indian  national,  state  and  local  environmental  laws,  and  lessons  learned  during  the \nimplementation of the ongoing Loan 2151-IND: Multisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in \nJammu and Kashmir12 and the preparation of initial environmental examination (IEE) reports for the \nsample subprojects.  \n \n2.  This  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)  of  JKUSDP  aims  at  (i) \ndetermining the anticipated environmental impacts arising from the follow-on subprojects based on \nthe IEE reports of four sample subprojects in Jammu and Srinagar, (ii) identifying environmental \nmitigation measures and environmental monitoring plans required to address anticipated negative \nenvironmental impacts, (iii) providing formats and guidelines for selecting follow-on subprojects \nbased  on  environmental  eligibility  criteria  and  conducting  environmental  assessments,  and  (iv) \ndefining the environmental assessment review procedures for future follow-on subprojects proposed \nunder JKUSDP. \n \nB.  Overview of the JKUSDP \n \n3.  The proposed Project is primarily designed to promote economic development in the cities of \nJammu  and  Srinagar  and  selected  towns  of  the  state  of  Jammu  and  Kashmir  through  urban \ninfrastructure  provision,  focusing  on  water  supply,  sewerage,  municipal  solid  waste  (MSW) \nmanagement, and urban transport. The specific objectives of the JKUSDP are to (i) improve the \nenvironmental conditions of the cities and other important towns of the state of Jammu and Kashmir; \n(ii) reduce poverty in low-income areas by improving access to basic urban services; and (iii) \nimprove the service-delivery capacities of the cities and other important towns through institutional \ndevelopment. In view of the lack of basic infrastructure facilities and their adverse impacts on the \nenvironment  and  socioeconomic  characteristics,  the  proposed  JKUSDP  aims  to  provide \ninfrastructure facilities\u2014such as adequate and safe water supply and sanitation facilities\u2014that will \ndirectly  benefit  a  considerable  population.  The  primary  project  beneficiaries  are  expected  to \ncomprise lower income and poor households. JKUSDP is designed to complement ADB\u2019s ongoing \nMultisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir. \n \n4.  JKUSDP comprises the following components: \n \n(i)  Water Supply. This component's main activities are: (i) rehabilitation of existing head \nworks; (ii) improving transmission and distribution system (mains and reservoirs), and \nprovision of new infrastructure; (iii) building reservoirs; and (iv) installing distribution \nsystem (including metered house service connections); \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India for the \nMultisector Project for Infrastructure Rehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir. Manila (Loan 2151-IND, for $250 million, \napproved on 21 December). ", "  55\n(ii)  Sewerage and sanitation. This component's main activities are: (i) rehabilitation of \nexisting sewer networks, (ii) rehabilitation of sewage pumping stations; (iii) expansion \nof  existing  sewerage  networks,  collection  systems,  and  treatment  plants,  and \nconstruction of new ones; and (iv) rehabilitation of community and public sanitation \nfacilities; \n(iii)  Solid Waste Management. This component will focus on improving integrated solid \nwaste collection systems, storage and transfer stations, transportation, treatment, and \ndisposal systems; engineered landfills with efficient drainage systems and leachate \ncollection and treatment facilities will be built; and \n(iv)  Urban Transport. This component will focus on improving: (i) urban roads; (ii) critical \nroad  links;  (iii)  traffic  management;  (iv)  street  lighting;  (vi)  road  safety;  and  (vii) \nflyovers, grade separators,  underpasses,and pedestrian subways. \n5.  The four sample subprojects chosen for the JKUSDP correspond to the above four sectors. \nThe sample subprojects are: (i) Sindh canal raw water pipeline at Srinagar; (ii) sewerage and \nsewage treatment system for Jammu; (iii) municipal solid waste treatment and disposal facility for \nSrinagar; and (iv) improvement of the Banihal Cart (BC) Road and construction of new vehicle cum \npedestrian subway and grade separator at the Rehari Chowk junction  in Jammu.   \n \n6.  Potential Environmental Impacts. Though the proposed JKUSDP aims to improve the \nenvironmental quality of urban areas, the development of infrastructure facilities may potentially \ncause certain negative environmental impacts. The implementation of subprojects can have adverse \nimpacts on various environmental aspects, namely: (i) topography and drainage, (ii) soil and land \nuse, (iii) surface water, (iv) groundwater resources, (v) ambient air quality, (vi) noise levels, (vii) biotic \nenvironment, (viii) cultural and historic sites, and (ix) other socioeconomic impacts. These impacts \nmay arise in the project lifecycle during implementation and/or during operation phase, and in limited \ncases may also arise after the end of the operation period. The potential environmental impacts are \ncategorized into (i) location impacts, (ii) design impacts, (iii) construction impacts, and (iv) operation \nand maintenance impacts.  \n \n7.  An illustrative list of potential negative environmental impacts resulting from the proposed \ncomponents is summarized below: \n \n(i)  Water Supply. The anticipated environmental impacts comprise: (a) high noise levels \nfrom the operation of pumping stations; (b) pollution and health risks resulting from \nimproper handling and/or disposal of sludge from water treatment plants; (c) blocking of \nroads during laying of the distribution network; and (d) dust from construction activities, \nwhich could be considerable because of the dry climatic conditions; (e) recurrence of \nleakage problems; \n \n(ii)  Sewerage.  The  anticipated  environmental  impacts  comprise:  (a)  contamination  of \ngroundwater  resources,  (b)  loss  of  amenity  and  odor  nuisance  to  neighbors,  (c) \npollution of agricultural fields, groundwater, or surface water caused by partially treated \nsewage,  (d)  nuisance  and  pollution  of  groundwater  and  surface  water  caused  by \noverflowing of sewers, (e) nuisance caused by mosquito breeding and bad odors from \nsewage  treatment  plants  and  overflowing  sewers,  (f)  pollution  and  health  hazards \nresulting from improper sludge disposal methods, (g) dust and noise nuisance and \nblocking of roads during laying of the sewer network, and (h) increased traffic flow \nresulting from vehicle movement associated with construction activities; \n ", "56   \n \n(iii)  Municipal  Solid  Waste  Management.  The  anticipated  environmental  impacts \ncomprise: (a) nuisance to surrounding areas; (b) groundwater contamination caused by \nrunoff  from  landfill  areas;  (c)  nuisance  resulting  from  location  of  waste  collection \ncontainers; (d) waste mixing with monsoon or storm-water runoff creating potentially \nunhygienic conditions around the sites; (e) contamination of groundwater by leachate \nfrom  landfills;  (f)  impact  of  methane  gas  emissions  from  landfills;  (g)  pollution  of \nagricultural lands and entering of traces into food chain as a result of application of \ncompost containing heavy metals; (h) bird menace at the waste disposal facilities; (i) \ndust nuisance and nuisance caused by spillage of waste-collection residue and waste \nduring  transportation;  and  (j)  health  and  safety  hazards  to  workers  during  waste \ncollection, transportation, and at compost and disposal sites; and \n \n(iv)  Urban  transport.  The  anticipated  environmental  impacts  comprise:  (a)  loss  of \nhousehold  residences  and  business  premises;  (b)  encroachment  on  wetlands;  (c) \ndisruption of commercial activities; (d) encroachment on and loss of natural heritage \nsites, historical areas, cultural areas, or monuments; (e) blocking of view lines along \nvisual corridors by flyovers or grade separators; (f) reduction in width of water courses  \ncaused  by  road  embankments  may  affect  the  flow  of  watercourses;  (g)  noise \ndisturbances affecting educational, healthcare and cultural activities; (h) flyovers or \ngrade  separators  may  be  out  of  scale  with  adjacent  urban  development;  (i)  road \nblocking  and/or  increased  traffic  during  construction  of  facilities;  (j)  noise,  dust,  or \nhazardous material generated by construction activities; (k) increased turbidity and \nsilting of watercourses caused by erosion of soils during construction; (l) silt runoff \nduring construction leading to impairment of downstream water quality; land values; \nand (m) environmental issues resulting from uncontrolled quarrying of raw materials. \n \n8.  The IEEs conducted for the sample subprojects indicate that typical urban infrastructure \nprojects in Jammu and Kashmir are unlikely to have any significant adverse environmental impacts. \nBased  on  the  site  visits,  data  collected,  and  on-the-spot  public  consultations  that  the  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  fact-finding  mission  engaged  in,  three  sample \nsubprojects (covering water supply, sewerage, and urban transportation) have been categorized as \nenvironment  category  B.  The  fourth  subproject\u2014the  Srinagar  solid  waste  management  (SWM) \nfacility\u2014has been categorized as category \"B Sensitive\" because of concerns raised by locals, and \nbecause it is likely that toxic and hazardous substances, including biomedical wastes, may be \npresent, and that the soil and groundwater may have been contaminated by leachate from the \nexisting dump site.13  \n \n9.  Subsequent to this, further work on the project scope has found that some of the follow-on \nsubprojects to be considered for ADB financing (under subsequent tranches of this proposed sector \nloan  under  multitranche  financing  facility  modality)  may  be  encroaching  upon  environmentally \nsensitive  areas  such  as  wildlife  sanctuaries and  reserved  forests. While  most  of  the  follow-on \nsubprojects will pertain to rehabilitation of old and damaged existing urban facilities, a few follow-on \nsubprojects may comprise partially or totally new developments. The updated and accurate maps \nshowing the boundaries of all of these environmentally sensitive areas are not available with the \n                                                 \n13  Category B.  Subproject components judged to have some adverse environmental impacts, but of lesser degree \nand/or significance than those for category A projects.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) is required to determine \nwhether significant environmental impacts warranting an EIA are likely. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the \nfinal environmental assessment report. Some category B projects are deemed to be environmentally sensitive. These \ninvolve processing, handling, and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances or other environmentally sensitive activities \nthat also may be of concern to a wide group of external stakeholders. ", "  57\nrelevant  authorities.  Under  the  ongoing  PPTA,  these  follow-on  subproject  locations  will  be \nsuperimposed on available maps to assess their likelihood of encroaching upon environmentally \nsensitive areas; however, these maps will not be available until the development of the second or \nthird batch of follow-on subprojects (to be financed under subsequent tranches of the proposed \nmultitranche financing facility). \n \n10.  Considering the scale, magnitude, and type of the urban development investments proposed \nunder this sector loan (mainly covering water supply, sewerage, solid waste management, and \nurban transportation), the sample and follow-on subprojects are judged to have minor, temporary \nenvironmental impacts that are largely construction-related and reversible in nature. These impacts \nwill be mitigated through carefully developed environmental management plans (EMPs) that will be \nincorporated into related contract documents as budgeted line items in the bill of quantities. \n \n11.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and EAG (2003), the determination of \nthe environment category is to be based on the most environmentally sensitive component of the \nProject.  Based on the environmental assessment carried out for the four sample subprojects under \nthe first tranche, the proposed Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Development Project loan has \nbeen categorized as environment category B Sensitive. \n \n12.  Limited numbers of follow-on subprojects are likely to be encroaching upon environmentally \nsensitive  areas  such  as  wildlife  sanctuaries  and  reserved  forests.  A  detailed  EARF  has  been \ndeveloped  to  cover  the  likelihood  of  inclusion  of  category  A  (follow-on)  subproject(s)  in  the \nsubsequent tranche(s). \n \n13.

The  environmental  assessment  review  procedures  for  any  subproject  included  under \nJKUSDP will address the requirements of the acts, rules, notifications, and standards given below: \n \n(i)  The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, as amended; \n(ii)  The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981, as amended; \n(iii)  The Environment (Protection) Act ,1986, as amended; \n(iv)  The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 1994, as amended; \n(v)  The Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules, 2000, as amended; \n(vi)  The Biomedical Wastes (Management and handling) Rules, 1998, as amended; \n(vii)  The Jammu and Kashmir Forest (Conservation) Act, 1997, as amended; \n(viii)  Jammu and Kashmir Wildlife Protection Act, 1978, as amended; and \n(ix)  Land Development Act, under Jammu and Kashmir State Constitutional Laws, Vol. IV \npertaining to Protected Areas, as amended. \n \n15.  In addition to these acts, the following standards shall be taken into account for evaluating \nwater supply subprojects: \n \n(i)  National Drinking Water Standard, Indian Standard 10500: 1993; and \n(ii)  WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water, 1996, pertaining to pesticides.14  \n \n16.  Any project included under JKUSDP generating liquid or air emissions should obtain consent \nto establish from the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) under the 1974 Water Act and the 1981 \nAir  Act  before  commencement  of  construction  activities.  The  Jammu  and  Kashmir  Economic \nReconstruction Agency (ERA), the designated Executing Agency, shall also ensure that consent to \noperate is obtained from the SPCB before commissioning of those projects. During the operational \nphase of the project, it is required that regular environmental monitoring under those regulations be \ncarried out to ensure that the subprojects continue to comply with the statutory environmental \nstandards prescribed. The sample subprojects under sewerage and MSW management require \ncompliance with the above requirement. \n \n17.  The 1994 EIA Notification, issued under India's 1986 Environmental (Protection) Act, requires \napproval from the Government of India's Ministry of Environment and Forests for certain types of \nprojects.  The  schedule  of  Notification15  requires  that  EIAs  be  conducted  for  new  development \nprojects costing of Rs1.0 billion or more, and for capacity augmentation projects costing Rs500 \n                                                 \n14  There are no guidelines under Indian legislation for pesticide limits in drinking water. \n15  Ministry of Environment and Forests EIA notification schedule SO(60) dated 27 Jan 1994 and latest amendment thereof. \n ", "60   \nmillion or more. None of the sample subprojects included in JKUSDP are expected to require \nenvironmental clearance under the 1994 EIA Notification. \n \n18.  Considering  the  nature  and  scale  of  urban  infrastructure  facilities  under  JKUSDP  and \nassociated environmental impacts, the 1994 EIA Notification does not apply to JKUSDP. However, \nany future subprojects meeting the following criteria shall obtain environmental clearance from the \nMinistry of Environment and Forests and the State Forest Department,16 as applicable: \n \n(i)  projects requiring forestland, \n(ii)  tarred roads in forests, \n(iii)  widening of roads requiring land acquisition more than 20 meters on either side, and \n(iv)      tourism projects at elevations of more than 1,000 meters with investment more than \nRs50 million  \n \n19.  The Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handing) Rules, 2000, issued under the \nEnvironment  (Protection)  Act,  1986,  require  urban  local  bodies  or  facility  operators  to  obtain \nauthorization  from  the  SPCB  for  collection,  treatment,  and  disposal  of  municipal  solid  wastes \ngenerated in their jurisdiction. These rules prescribe a policy for waste management, that covers: (i) \nwaste collection and storage; (ii) segregation of waste; (iii) littering; (iv) transportation; and (v) waste \nprocessing (compost plants, energy recovery, etc.). For MSW management facilities to be developed \nunder  the  JKUSDP,  The  Jammu  and  Kashmir  ERA  shall  ensure  that  the  relevant  municipal \ncorporations, other urban local bodies, or development authorities, obtain site clearances, applicable \nconsents and appropriate authorizations from SPCB for collection, storage, transport, treatment, and \ndisposal of the MSW. \n \n20.  The following are the provisions of the MSW Rules, 2000, applicable to JKUSDP. \n \n(i)  The municipal authority shall take all steps needed to ensure that municipal solid \nwaste generated in their jurisdiction shall be handled and disposed of without causing \nadverse impacts on human health and environment; \n(ii)  The municipal authority or facility operator shall apply to the SPCB in Form-I for grant \nof authorization to set up a waste processing and disposal facility, including landfills; \n(iii)  The municipal authority shall furnish its annual report in Form-II to the SPCB, annually \non or before the 30th day of June; and  \n(iv)  Any municipal solid waste generated in a city or a town shall be managed and \nhandled in accordance with the compliance criteria and the procedure laid down in \nSchedule-II. \n \n21.  The  Biomedical  Wastes  (Management  and  Handling)  Rules,  1998,  require  healthcare \ninstitutions to provide their own biomedical waste treatment and disposal facilities, or to establish a \ncommon facility through an association of healthcare institutions or through an operator as per the \nrules without causing any adverse impact human health and environment. The urban local bodies \nare  responsible  for  identifying  suitable  sites  for  such  common  disposal  facilities.  Healthcare \ninstitutions are required to obtain authorization from the SPCB for the disposal of biomedical wastes. \n                                                 \n16  The Government of India's Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act are not applicable to the state of Jammu and \nKashmir, and hence any activity encroaching into the forest area needs to obtain clearance from the State Forest \nDepartment, as per the Jammu and Kashmir Forest (Conservation) Act, 1997. ", "  61\nCurrently only a small portion of the biomedical wastes generated in the state is being treated and \ndisposed as stipulated. Untreated biomedical waste usually gets mixed with the MSW. ERA shall \nfacilitate implementation of biomedical waste treatment facilities so as to ensure that no biomedical \nwaste is mixed with MSW and received at the MSW management facilities proposed under JKUSDP. \n \n22.

Environmental Criteria for Subproject Selection \n \n26.  The following criteria will be used for selecting subprojects to be financed under JKUSDP: \n \n(i)  Subprojects  will  comply  with  environmental  requirements  specified  in  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002)  and  EAG  (2003)  and  those  specified  in  India's \nenvironmental regulations, including laws and standards of the state of Jammu and \nKashmir; \n(ii)  Subprojects likely to be categorized as environmental category A [as defined by \nADB\u2019s EAG (2003), as amended from time to time] will be considered for financing \n ", "64   \nunder JKUSDP\u2014subject to the Project being re-categorized as environment category \nA; \n(iii)  Subprojects shall not encroach into on any national park or national park buffer zone; \n(iv)  Subprojects  encroaching  into  any  core  or  buffer  zones  of  wildlife  sanctuaries, \nsensitive wetlands, reserved forests, or other environmentally sensitive areas shall \nobtain  national,  state  and  local  statutory  environmental  clearances  (including \nclearance from the Supreme Court of India, if required) before commencing with \nworks; \n(v)  Subprojects shall not affect any historical or cultural heritage sites or areas; \n(vi)  Subprojects should not cause or intensify drainage problems in other areas;  \n(vii)  Flood-mitigation  and  drainage-improvement  works  will  be  designed  taking  into \naccount downstream effects; and \n(viii)  Subprojects shall avoid or minimize: \na.  destruction or disturbance of historical or cultural items or areas; \nb.  causing or exacerbating environmental hazards; \nc.  development or activities that might mobilize the acid reaction of acid sulfate \nsoils;  \nd.  development on flood-prone land or floodplains; \ne.  damage to valuable ecology and natural heritage areas; \nf.  disturbance to the extent, depth, or hydrological balance of wetlands;  \ng.  adding to the effluent load entering lakes and river systems; and \nh.  disruption, resettlement, or relocation of communities. \n \n27.  Taking into account the potential environmental impacts of the subprojects and ADB\u2019s EAG \n(2003), the environmental classification of the subprojects under JKUSDP will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Category  A.  Subproject  components  are  projected  to  have  potentially  significant \nadverse environmental impacts. An EIA is required to address significant impacts. \nThis type of subproject requires an EIA report (including an EMP); the SEIA must be \ndisclosed publicly 120 days prior to approval by ADB; \n \n(ii)  Category  B.  Subproject  components  are  projected  to  have  some  adverse \nenvironmental impacts, but they are expected to be less significant than impacts \nassociated with category A projects. An IEE is required to determine whether an EIA \nis warranted. If an EIA is not needed, the IEE is regarded as the final environmental \nassessment report. Category B subprojects will be categorized as \u201cB Sensitive\u201d if they \nare located near environmentally sensitive areas or involve (a) deforestation; (b) loss \nof biodiversity; (c) involuntary resettlement, (d) processing, handling, or disposal of \ntoxic and hazardous substances; or (e) other environmentally sensitive activities that \nmay affect a wide group of external stakeholders. Category B subprojects requires \nIEE reports, including an EMPs; SIEEs have to be disclosed publicly 120 days prior to \napproval by ADB; and \n \n(iii)  Category C. Subproject components are unlikely to have adverse environmental \nimpacts. No EIA or IEE is required, although environmental implications are still \nreviewed. \n ", "  65\n28.  Taking into account of the potential impacts associated with the subprojects of JKUSDP, the \nfollowing environmental criteria for specific components of JKUSDP will be adopted as guidelines for \nthe selection of subsequent subprojects. \n \n(i)  Water supply.  \n(a)  Avoid water-use conflicts in abstraction of raw water for water supply with \nother beneficial water uses; \n(b)  Avoid siting raw water supply extraction where there are upstream wastewater \ndischarges; \n(c)  Avoid hazard of land subsidence caused by excessive groundwater pumping; \n(d)  Avoid overpumping of groundwater, which could lead to salinization; \n(e)  Avoid generating more sewage than existing community facilities can handle; \n(f)  Avoid excessive abstraction of water, which could downstream water users; \nand \n(g)  Ensure adequate availability of water at source. \n \n  (ii)  Sewerage and sanitation. \n(a)  Avoid  areas  of  incompatible  land  use  (e.g.,  densely  populated  residential \nareas, schools, or hospitals); \n(b)  Avoid  impairment  of  downstream  water  quality  caused  by  release  of \ninadequately treated or untreated sewage; \n(c)  Choose  sites  where  overflows  can  be  controlled  to  avoid  impacts  on \nneighboring properties; and \n(d)  Choose sites to minimize hazards to public health due to overflow flooding, \nand groundwater pollution due to failure of sewerage system \n \n(iii)  Municipal solid waste management. \n(a)  Avoid areas that do not conform to the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management \nand Handling) Rules, 2000; \n(b)  Avoid areas of high population; \n(c)  Avoid contamination of receiving waters by leachate from land based disposal \nsystem; \n(d)  Avoid contamination of groundwater and/or surface water by leachate from \nland disposal system; \n(e)  Avoid \uf020land-use conflicts; \n(f)  Avoid landfill sites where there is insufficient space for a surrounding buffer \nzone to alleviate nuisances; and \n(g)  Design waste management collection and management practices to prevent \nworker health and safety hazards resulting from toxic gases and hazardous \nmaterials on-site. \n \n  (iv)  Urban transport.  \n(a)  Ensure  space  availability  for  road  safety,  residents,  pedestrians  and  for \ninstallation of noise and air pollution mitigation measures; \n(b)  Minimize disfiguration of landscape by road  embankments, cuts, fills, and \nquarries; \n(c)  Minimize alteration of hydrology of waterways crossed by roads; \n(d)  Minimize dislocation or involuntary resettlement of people living in right-of-\nway; \n(e)  \uf020Minimize  the  risk  of  driving  accidents  where  construction  interferes  with \npreexisting roads; and \n ", "66   \n(f)  Minimize  the  risk  of  accidents  associated  with  increased  vehicular  traffic, \nwhich may lead to accidental spills of toxic materials and/or loss of life. \n \n  3.  Procedures for Environmental Assessment of Subprojects \n \n29.  The  procedures  for  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  must  be  in  line  with  the \nrequirements of national, state, and local statutory environmental regulations, as well as ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002), EAG (2003), as amended from time to time, and these Environment \nAssessment and Review Procedures. \n \n30.  Environmental Classification. PMUs will prepare a rapid environmental assessment (REA) \nchecklist for each subproject. The formats for the REA checklists are given in Appendix 2.  After \nscreening by ERA, a duly signed REA checklist will be submitted to ADB for review and confirmation \nof the environmental classification of each subproject. If any of the follow-on subprojects is classified \nas environment category A, then the entire Project will be recategorized as environment category A \nso that the given Category A follow-on subproject is eligible for project financing. \n \n31.  Preparation of EIAs, SEIAs, IEEs and SIEEs: PMUs will prepare an EIA and SEIA for \nsubprojects classified as Category A and prepare an IEE and SIEE for  subprojects classified as B or \nB Sensitive. The IEE contents will comprise: (i) an introduction; (ii) description of the subproject, (iii) \ndescription of the environment, (iv) screening of potential environmental impacts and mitigation \nmeasures, (v) institutional requirements and environmental monitoring plan, (vi) public consultation \nand information disclosure, (vii) findings and recommendations, and (viii) conclusions. The EIA will \nhave additional sections for (i) alternatives, and (ii) economic assessment [as detailed in ADB\u2019s EAG \n(2003)17]. The EIA or IEE for each subproject will include an EMP to ensure proper environmental \nmanagement of the subproject. ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects, \n1993, will be used to identify major environmental issues. During EIA or IEE preparation, public \nconsultation will be carried out,18 and the comments from the public will be reflected in the final EIA \nor IEE. The SEIA or SIEE will be made available to the public while the  EIA or IEE will be available \nupon request. The SEIAs and SIEEs (for B Sensitive subprojects) will also be subject to ADB\u2019s \u201c120 \nday\u201d rule for the approval of follow-on subprojects. \n \n32.  Review of EIAs, IEEs, SEIAs, and SIEEs. EIAs, IEEs, SEIAs, and SIEEs prepared by the \nPMUs  will  be  initially  reviewed  by  ERA.  ERA  will  give  comments  to  the  subproject  PMU,  if \nnecessary, to revise the EIA or IEE. After this process, ERA will submit the EIA and SEIA (or the IEE \nand SIEE) to ADB, where they will be reviewed by ADB's Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment,  if  necessary.  Subproject  approval  will  be  given  based  on  ADB\u2019s  overall  review\u2014\nincluding the review of environmental aspects. Any subproject observed to be in noncompliance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines or requirements will not be eligible for financing under JKUSDP. Subprojects \nidentified for financing under JKUSDP are mainly urban infrastructure development subprojects, \nwhich do not need environmental clearance. However, for subprojects that require environmental \nclearance, such clearance must be obtained well before any implementation activity commences. \n \n33.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure. ERA is responsible for ensuring that all \nenvironmental assessment documentation, including monitoring the implementation of EMPs, and \nenvironmental monitoring plans shall be systematically documented. The environmental assessment \ndocuments are subject to public disclosure and shall be made available, if required. ERA shall \n                                                 \n17 Appendix 2 of EAG (2003). \n18 Two  consultations will take place for  EIAs  and one consultation will take place for IEEs as detailed in Chapter X of \nEAG (2003). ", "  67\nensure that in carrying out an IEE for any subproject under JKUSDP, at least one consultation with \naffected people will be carried out to gather their concerns about the subproject and its likely \nimpacts. If an EIA is required, ERA shall ensure that two consultations with affected people are \nundertaken. The aim of the first consultation will be to gather affected persons' concerns about the \nsubproject and its impacts. The aim of the second consultation will be to share the EMP with \naffected persons and gather their views on the EMP. For any subproject categorized as B Sensitive \nor A, the SIEE (for category B sensitive) or SEIA (for category A) shall be disclosed on ADB\u2019s \nwebsite for 120 days prior to approval of the subproject. Environmental assessment reports for ADB \nprojects will be accessible to interested parties and the general public. It is required that SIEE and \nSEIA  reports  be  circulated  worldwide,  through  the  depository  library  system  and  on  the  ADB \nwebsite. The full EIA or IEE reports are also made available to interested parties on request. \n \n34.  Monitoring  Environmental  Performance.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan  will  be \nprepared for each subproject. This plan will recommend environmental monitoring mechanisms to be \nused to indicate the effectiveness of the EMP in mitigating negative impacts identified in the EIA or \nIEE. The plan will also identify the agencies and institutions that are responsible for monitoring. The \nERA  has  the  overall  responsibility  to  monitor  the  implementation  of  the  EMPs\u2014including \nenvironmental mitigation measures\u2014for all subprojects under JKUSDP. \n \n35.  During the design and preconstruction stage, monitoring will be the responsibility of the \nPMUs. This is mainly in the form of review and  verification of designs and incorporation of mitigation \nmeasures  into  design  and  contract  documents.  Mitigation  measures  to  be  taken  during  the \nconstruction stage will be mostly implemented by the main contractor. The PMUs will also monitor \nthe environmental performance. During the operation stage, monitoring will be the responsibility of \nthe operator, such as the urban local body or line department or agency; however, the SPCB is also \ndelegated with periodic responsibility for third-party monitoring. There are no significant impacts \nenvisaged during either the development or operation phase. However, facilities such as STP and \nMSW disposal facilities may have impacts at the operation stage. The significance of these impacts \nwill  depend  on  the  operational  performance  of  these  facilities.  Although  sufficient  care  and \nappropriate mitigation will be incorporated into the design of these facilities, performance monitoring \nduring operation will be essential to making the investments environmentally suitable and socially \nacceptable. Therefore, environmental parameters to be monitored during the subproject lifecycle \nhave been identified. \n \n36.  Reports on the implementation of environmental management and environmental monitoring \nplans need to be documented systematically. ERA shall ensure that ADB will be given access to \nundertake  environmental  review  of  any  subproject,  as  and  when  required.    When  unexpected \nenvironmental impacts are encountered during implementation, ERA, in close consultation with ADB, \nshall undertake remedial measures to mitigate those impacts at the earliest opportunity. These \nenvironmental mitigation measures shall be implemented and thoroughly monitored by ERA. The \nactions and the results shall be recorded in writing and included in the environmental monitoring \nreport.  PMUs  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  for  subprojects  that  will  capture  the  status  of \nimplementation of mitigation measures and monitoring carried out thereof. ERA will consolidate \nquarterly reports for individual subprojects and submit the reports to ADB for public disclosure in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Public Communication Policy (2005).  If ERA finds any issues that need \nfurther environmental monitoring and/or mitigation measures, ERA will give instruction to PMUs, and \ninform ADB. ADB will review the implementation of the EMP, both through quarterly reports from \nERA, and through its review missions. \n \n ", "68   \nE.

ERA will with the help of Consultants review the EIAs/IEEs and corresponding EMPs to \nensure that the mitigation measures and monitoring plan proposed are adequate and conform to \nADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard policies. ADB in consultation with the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department as deemed necessary, will confirm the compliance. For this \npurpose, ERA will provide ADB with access to information on any subproject, as needed. The \ninformation on the implementation of the EMP, as well as that on the environmental safeguard \ncompliance will be systematically documented and reported to ADB as a part of the quarterly reports \ncontaining a section on the implementation of the EMP and environmental monitoring plan. \n \n38.  Each  PMU  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  assessment  documentation,  including  the \nenvironmental monitoring reports, is properly and systematically kept as part of subproject specific \nrecords. The procedure will follow the EARF developed during the appraisal of the initial subprojects. \n \nF.  Staffing Requirements and Budget \n \n39.  Conducting the environmental assessment as detailed above is the responsibility of ERA. It \nhas  established  PMU  offices  under  ongoing  ADB-financed  Multisector  Project  for  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir at Jammu and Srinagar. Each PMU office has one fulltime \nqualified  environmental  expert.  In  addition,  under  the  Multisector  Project  for  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation in Jammu and Kashmir a significant number of staff in ERA is being trained in \nenvironment-related issues. ERA will develop in-house expertise that is neutral from operations to \nfocus on independent environmental monitoring so that environmental concerns are mainstreamed \nin every aspects of the project implementation. In addition to the strengthening of environmental \nassessment and monitoring capability of ERA, environmental capacity building programs for SPCB \nand  other  line  agencies  and  /or  implementing  agencies  are  proposed  to  be undertaken under \nJKUSDP. \n \n40.  Under JKUSDP, the PMUs will be responsible for preparing REA checklists, and for the \nimplementation and monitoring of EMPs. ERA, if necessary, will engage consultants to prepare the \nREA and the IEE or EIA until the in-house staff has been trained adequately. A timeframe of 15 days \nis considered sufficient to prepare an IEE report, and up to 120 days is considered sufficient for an \nEIA report. Hence the budget allocation as per the local rates would be in the range of $4,000 for an \nIEE and $20,000 for an EIA.  Sufficient budget funds and resources have been incorporated into \nJKUSDP to cover costs to (i) implement the environmental review procedures, (ii) conduct IEEs and \nEIAs for the follow up subprojects, (iii) monitor the implementation of the environmental management \nplan, and (iv) undertake environmental monitoring.  \n \nG.  Conclusion  \n \n41.  This environmental assessment and review framework has been formulated for the use of \nERA and PMUs to ensure that the follow-on subprojects will be prepared and implemented in \naccordance with the statutory environmental regulations at the national, state and local levels, and \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003), as amended \nfrom time to time. \n ", "  69\nAnnex A Rapid Environmental Assessment (REA) Checklist \n \nWater Supply Sector \n \nInstructions: \n(cid:131)  This checklist is to be prepared to support the environmental classification of a project.

Urban Infrastructure and Environmental Improvements \n \ni.  Water Supply Subproject \n \n1.  Subproject Introduction. Despite adequate availability of raw water and installed production \ncapacity, water supply services in Srinagar and Jammu are intermittent, inequity in spatial supply \nand often of poor quality.  Just over 80% of the population has access to piped water as a result of \nnearly  60%  production  and  distribution  losses,  including  illegal  connections.  There  is  also  a \nmismatch between assured raw water availability, available water treatment capacities, transmission, \nand distribution capacities in the two project cities. \n \n2.  The problem of water supply in Srinagar is compounded during the summer months when \nthere is a large influx of tourists and reduced flow in some water sources feeding the water treatment \nplants. \n \n3.  Subproject Description. The subproject addresses the problems of raw water security and \nprotects the raw water quality for three main water works in Srinagar, namely Rangil, Alusteng and \nNishat by installing a pipeline to carry the existing and future quantum of water reserved for PHED \nSrinagar in the Sindh Extension Canal (SEC).  \n \n4.  PHED Srinagar has entered into an agreement with the Power Development Corporation \n(PDC) to make available a total of 4.7 cumecs raw water from the proposed tunnel passing close to \nRangil for generating hydroelectricity at Beehama.  When this larger quantity of water becomes \navailable, the subproject pipeline could be operated at a higher pressure rating in the future to \ntransport additional raw water when required.  \n \n5.  The subproject will also reduce the dependence of Nishat WTP on pumping water from the \nDal Lake more than 100m below.  Besides saving power it also reduces need for extracting water \nfrom this environmentally sensitive lake. \n \n6.  The subproject includes: \n \n(i)  Laying of about 2.5km  pipeline from Rangil WTP to Alustang WTP take-off; \n(ii)  Laying of about 7.5km  pipeline from Alustang WTP take-off to Harwan Reservoir; \n(iii)  Sectionalising valves/gates, scour arrangements, air valves, siphons and other \nappurtenances \n \nii.  Sewerage Subproject \n \n7.  Subproject Introduction. Waste water management is one of the most important obligatory \nfunctions of the Government or Local Bodies from the Public Health point of view.  In this regard, the \n ", "two project cities are no exception, despite the serious threat of contaminating water bodies within \nthe cities and the stipulations of the Environment Protection Act of 1986. \n \n8.  There is presently no city wide system for collection treatment or disposal in Jammu city.  In \nthe older sections of the city the latrines still continue and in other areas, the un-treated sewage and \nsullage is discharged into storm water drains causing public health risk. Newer houses in relatively \nmore planned and organized colonies have septic tanks but the partially treated effluent is usually \ndischarged into open road drains which flow into the natural drainage channels that pass through the \ncity.  . \n \n9.  Subproject Description. The city has been divided up into 4 main sewerage catchments \n(Divisions A to D).  Division A includes the most densely populated areas of the Old City; Division B \nto the north west of the old city was mostly developed after 1947; Division C is the rapidly developing \narea around the Rail Head; and Division D is the new expanding industrial area in the south east.   \n \n10.  Division A is sub-divided into Phases I and II.  Phase I is the Old City and Phase II is the \ndensely populated area below towards the Tawi River.  The    subproject is designed to collect \ndomestic wastewater from Phase II plus a small section of Division B and provide treatment before \ndisposal into the Tawi River, down stream of the city.  The    subproject will cater to about 230,000 \npersons by the design year 2021 within an area of 490 Ha.  Division A, Phase II, has six sectors, of \nwhich sector 1 sewerage and sewage treatment plant has been almost completed using GoJK \nfunds.    Phase  I  which  drains  into  Phase  II  will  be  implemented  as  a  subsequent  subproject.  \nAdequate land is available at Bhagwati Nagar for constructing sewage treatment plant facilities to \ncater for both phases. \n \n11.  The subproject includes: \n \n(i)  Construction of about  200km of trunk main, secondary sewers, laterals and house \nconnections including manholes and chambers; \n(ii)  Construction of sewage treatment plant, including integration of the existing sewage \ntreatment facilities, to cater for 30 MLD sewage; \n(iii)  Standby power generation for main sewage pumping station and treatment plant; \n(iv)  Administration office with sanitation and rest facilities for workers; \n(v)  Site works including access roads, screening plantation and landscaping \n \niii.  Solid Waste Management Subproject \n \n12.  Subproject Introduction. Solid waste management is one of the most important obligatory \nfunctions of Urban Local Bodies, but due to the lack financial resources and manpower, the use of \ninappropriate equipment, and weak management.  As a result there is no short or long term planning \ndue to lack analytic information on the waste generated or public awareness of civic responsibility for \nmaintaining a clean and healthy living environment. The two project cities and regional centers \nexhibit similar problems and fail to satisfy the Municipal Solid Wastes (Management and Handling) \nRules (2000). ", " \n13.  Subproject Description.1 The subproject is to hygienically and aesthetically dispose of \nmunicipal solid waste from Srinagar city at the existing 34 Ha Landfill site and provide treatment to \ncollected leachate.  The subproject will also extend the life of the Landfill site. A subproject of Loan \n2151-IND is being implemented to ensure efficient collection and transportation of solid waste from \nthe city to the SLF site. \n \n14.  The subproject includes: \n \n(i)  New two lane access road to main highway; \n(ii)  Improvements to perimeter fencing and landscaping inside of 100m \u2018no development\u2019 buffer \nzone, as indicated on the Srinagar Master Plan; \n(iii)  Administration office with sanitation and rest facilities for workers; \n(iv)  Weighbridge (computerized) of 50 tons capacity at the entry / exit; \n(v)  Lined sanitary landfill cell development including internal approach roads;  \n(vi)  Mechanical and hand equipment for waste segregation and composting;  \n(vii)  Spray equipment for pest repellent and disinfecting; \n(viii)  Equipment workshop and garage building; \n(ix)  Waste transport washing facilities; \n(x)  Leachate Collection and treatment facilities; \n(xi)  Improvement of administrative set-up for handling solid waste including training of staff. \n(xii)  If required, the subproject in Srinagar will also provide additional waste collection containers / \nbins, augment collection and handling transport, and improved sanitary waste disposal.   \n \n \niv. Urban transport subprojects \n \n15.  Subproject Introduction. The problem of congestion on main roads and intersections in the \nproject cities is a result of a combination of factors.  Traffic volumes have increased significantly in \nrecent years and most arterial roads have substandard road geometry to carry the amount of \nintercity and local traffic.  Prime issues of the urban transport system include: narrow width with \nheavy mixed traffic; absence of pedestrian facilities; inter-city bus traffic due to the location of inter-\ncity bus terminals within the city centers; absence of planned bus bays; inadequate parking facilities; \nnon-designed junctions; encroachment of right of way; absence of a planned road network; plus the \npoor road conditions. With the objective of holistically addressing city specific sector issues the \nscheme identification process included: (a) detailed assessment of the existing systems in relation to \nmaster plans or earlier studies; (b) review of on-going development initiatives; (c) need for additional \ninfrastructure strengthening; (d) analysis of environmental, land acquisition and social impacts; and \n(e) financial implications.   \n \n                                                 \n1 Due to recent ongoing discussions between Srinagar Municipal Corporation and the local residents, this \nsubproject may be shifted from existing site to a new site. ADB may consider this change if it becomes necessary \nsubject to compliance by the State and ERA of all requirements of the Loan Agreement and applicable policies and \nprocedures of ADB, India and the State; in which case, loan funds may be available for the subproject in the new \nsite subject to compliances with all requirements under the Loan Agreement. Additionally if the Site is to be \nrelocated, the loan funds may also be used to finance proper closure of the existing site, \n ", "16.  Subproject Description. The subproject proposal is to widen BC Road in Jammu from \nSakuntala Crossing to Children\u2019s Hospital Junction (length 0.95km) to a minimum of 3 x 7.5 m \ncarriageway  corridor  and  3m  wide  median  along  with  a  one-way  flyover  and  pedestrian  cum \nvehicular sub-way.  The BC road at either end of this section is already of four lanes.  The road \nsection is on a moderate slope which reduces speed of buses and heavy vehicles leaving the city \ncausing traffic build ups.  In addition, local buses and auto-rickshaws have no place to stop, which \nincreases traffic congestion.   \n \n17.  The subproject includes: \n \n(i)  Widening of BC Road to 6 lane divided configuration with improvement of vertical profile; \n(ii)  2 \u2013lane flyover from Children\u2019s Hospital Junction to Rehari Junction; \n(iii)  Provision of Pedestrian cum vehicular underpass at Rehari Junction; \n(iv)  Provision/Improvement of footpaths on both sides of road; \n(v)  Provision of new bus-stops (6-8 buses) at Rehari Junction; \n(vi)  Re-locating existing Auto/Bus Stand to off the carriageway \n(vii)  Re-locating power / telephone service poles from carriageway; \n(viii)  Improvement of junctions with widening and channalisation; \n \nB.  Capacity  Building,  Institutional  Development,  Governance  and  Investment  Program \nSupport \n \n18.  This  component  will  support  (i)  consultancy  and  Investment  Program  administration \nassistance to the EA up to 2012; (ii) capacity building program of J&K State Pollution Control Board, \n(iii) development of accrual based accounting system in Jammu and Srinagar Municipal Corporation, \n(iv)  preparation  of  Economic  Opportunity  Development  Plans  (EODPs)  for  other  towns  and \ncommercial  centers  in  the  state.
