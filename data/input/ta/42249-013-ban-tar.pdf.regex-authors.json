INTRODUCTION \n1.  A consultation mission to assess the feasibility of a capacity development technical \nassistance (TA) project for capacity building for disaster risk finance was fielded in December \n2011. Following discussions with the Government of Bangladesh and development partners in \nBangladesh, the mission concluded that the proposed TA is in line with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for Bangladesh. In addition, the proposed \nTA complements the disaster risk management assistance currently being provided by other \ndevelopment partners.1 On 19 December 2011, the government formally requested ADB to \ninclude the TA in ADB\u2019s nonlending pipeline for 2012, and the related fact-finding mission was \nfielded from 27 February to 1 March 2012. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Bangladesh is a disaster-prone country, with floods being the most frequent and poses \nthe most severe danger.3 In an average year, river floods affect 20% of the country\u2019s surface \narea, and in extreme years, this can reach 68%. In 2004, an unusually severe flood inundated \n38%  of  the  country,  resulting  in  747  deaths,  economic  losses  of  $2.2  billion,  and  public \nrehabilitation costs of $1.5 billion. Cyclones also constitute a major risk for Bangladesh. In 2007, \nCyclone Sidr swept through the southwestern coastal areas, resulting in 3,363 deaths, 55,282 \ninjuries, and $2.3 billion in total economic damage.4 Bangladesh is also susceptible to other \ndangers, including drought, earthquakes, river bank erosion, tsunamis, arsenic contamination of \ngroundwater, soil salinity, and health pandemics. Because Bangladesh is a densely populated, \nlow-income  country,  natural  calamities  cause  disproportionate  and  adverse  impacts  to  its \npopulation and economy that could delay achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. \n \n3.  The government has made substantial efforts in disaster risk management and instituted \nnational disaster management structures and legislation both nationally and subnationally. The \nNational Disaster Management Council, which is headed by the Prime Minister, formulates and \nreviews  the  country\u2019s  disaster  management  policies  and  issues  directives  to  guide \nimplementation of those policies. The Ministry of Food and Disaster Management (MFDA) is the \nnational focal point for disaster management that oversees the Disaster Management and Relief \nDivision.  The  National  Disaster  Plan,  2010\u20132015,  which  was  approved  in  2010,  sets \ncomprehensive structures and policy actions for disaster risk management. \n \n4.  Despite the establishment of a comprehensive disaster risk management structure, the \napplication of financial protection in disaster risk management is still limited. In response to \ndisaster events, the government generally allocates budgetary funds for disaster relief and \nrehabilitation from a contingency account or reallocates funds across categories of expenditure. \nThis  often  disrupts  the  implementation  of  critical  public  investment  projects  necessary  for \nsustained economic growth. Further, private sector participation in disaster risk finance is almost \nnonexistent due to the absence of reliable parametric disaster risk models and limited financial \nsector development. \n \n5.  To cope better with disaster-related rehabilitation and reconstruction costs, both public \nand  private  sectors  increasingly  applied  ex  ante  disaster-related  financial  risk  transfer \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 February 2012. \n3  According to Maplecroft, Bangladesh is ranked at the highest financial risk from the threat of natural disasters. \n4  Government of Bangladesh, Disaster Management Bureau, Disaster Management and Relief Division. 2010. \nNational Plan for Disaster Management, 2010\u20132015. Dhaka. \n ", "2   \nmechanisms since the early 1990s. Disaster risk financing requires developing different options \naccording to the nature of the disaster, the probability of occurrence, and the potential loss of, or \nimpact on, life and physical capital. Two operations that can be included in these options are (i) \ncontingency budget financing, and (ii) disaster risk financing instruments. In particular, disaster \nrisk financing instruments can include insurance; reinsurance; insurance-linked securities (e.g., \ncatastrophe  bonds,  also  known  as  CAT  bonds); 5  contingency  drawdown  options;  or  a \ncombination of these. A diverse group of disaster microinsurance programs are also being \ntested to provide disaster protection to low-income populations. Variations and combinations of \ndifferent  types  of  disaster  risk  finance  can  be  applied  to  provide  a  comprehensive  set  of \nsolutions to the range of disaster risk profiles facing Bangladesh (i.e., from high frequency\u2013low \nseverity to low frequency\u2013high severity events). \n \n6.  If reliable institutional disaster risk financing can provide timely access to funds, the \nresulting relief and rehabilitation interventions could save lives and reduce economic losses. \nOther  potential  advantages  include  (i)  increased  government  control  over  the  financing  of \ndisasters, possibly including the immediate and timely availability of funds by amortizing risks \nover time, which reduces budget shocks; (ii) increased ability for the government to set its own \npriorities in the management of relief and rehabilitation; and (iii) increased transparency in the \ndelivery of relief and reconstruction projects. Increased public insurance, in whatever form, \ncould  also  stimulate  increased  private  cover  by  familiarizing  private  sector  firms  with  the \nBangladesh market. Disaster risk financing can also provide significant benefits by helping to \nprice risk and by providing mechanisms to incentivize investments in risk-reduction measures, \nfor example, through premium discounts. \n \n7.  In the country partnership strategy (footnote 1), disaster risk mitigation is one of the \nseven key strategic themes in ADB assistance for Bangladesh. The strategies include support \nfor  disaster  risk  reduction  by  extending  support  through  financing  measures  to  reduce \nBangladesh\u2019s exposure to disaster risk. Disaster risk management is also a key development \ngoal  of  the  government.  The  poverty  reduction  strategy  paper  for  Bangladesh  includes \ncommitments  to  ensure  comprehensive  disaster  risk  management  and  environmental \nsustainability so that these concerns can be incorporated into the national development process \nby  2015.6 Bangladesh\u2019s  Sixth  Five-Year  Plan,  2011\u20132015  also  promotes  climate  change \nadaptation and disaster risk reduction. \n \n8.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), together with a consortium of \nother development partners, including the Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom, the European Union, and the Swedish International Development Cooperation \nAgency, has been implementing the Comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP) II \nsince 2011 . The CDMP II aims to reduce Bangladesh\u2019s vulnerability to adverse natural hazards \nand extreme events, including the impacts of climate change, through risk management. It has \nsix  outcome  areas:  (i)  the  development  of  institutions  to  implement  comprehensive  risk \nreduction programs, (ii) reduced risk to rural populations, (iii) reduced risk to urban populations, \n(iv) improved disaster preparedness, (v) minimized disaster impacts on development funding, \nand (vi) community-level adaptation to extreme climate events. \n                                                 \n5  The catastrophe bond, or CAT bond, is a fixed income security that pays periodic coupons to the investor during \nthe life of the bond and insures the sponsor of the bond against a predefined set of natural disasters such as \nearthquakes or hurricanes. If a covered event occurs during the bond\u2019s life, the sponsoring country retains the \nbond principal to fund emergency relief and reconstruction work. CAT bonds are an efficient tool for countries to \ntransfer specific layers of their natural disaster risk to the capital markets and a viable alternative to standard \ninsurance or reinsurance coverage to access and benefit from hedging interest and capacity within markets. \n6  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission, General Economics Division. 2005. Bangladesh\u2013Unlocking the \nPotential\u2013National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction. Dhaka. \n ", "  3\n9.  In 2011, the World Bank, in collaboration with the Institute of Water Modeling and the \nCenter for Environmental and Geographic Information Services, carried out a study in disaster \nrisk management to estimate the adaptation costs from the increased risks of cyclones and \ninland monsoon floods. The study reported that the adaptation costs for Bangladesh will be \nabout  $5.7  billion  by  2050.  In  addition,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  has \nprovided a grant assistance to develop a typhoon warning system. While the assistance by \nother development partners has provided comprehensive support for disaster risk management \nin  Bangladesh,  disaster  risk  financing  has  not  yet  been  addressed.  The  TA  will  seek  to \ncoordinate the disaster risk management efforts of development partners. \n \n10.  The TA will enhance Bangladesh\u2019s disaster risk preparedness by building up public and \nprivate capacity to develop disaster risk finance solutions and by fostering links between the \npublic and private sectors in disaster risk mitigation. The TA will focus on formulating strategies \nto introduce a set of suitable disaster risk finance solutions in Bangladesh based on experiences \nin other regions, including in developed countries such as the United States and Japan. The TA \nwill also strive to maximize transparency and accountability in the use of funds for disaster risk \nmanagement. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved government preparedness for disaster \nrelief and rehabilitation. The outcome will be that the government is better positioned and \nequipped to plan disaster relief and rehabilitation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will focus on providing fiscal and financial protection to Bangladesh against \nnatural disasters by designing a midterm disaster risk financing strategy, potentially for both \nsovereign  and  non-sovereign  (which  could  include  the  needs  of  local  governments, \nhomeowners, small businesses, and poor communities). An effective financing strategy hinges \non several factors, including (i) the nature of the disaster risk profile, (ii) the funding gap, and (iii) \nthe cost and feasibility of available instruments. The funding gap in turn depends on the likely \nlevels of need (including contingent liabilities) and access to financing after a disaster (for relief, \nrecovery, and reconstruction). Below is the framework of analysis. \n \n ", "4   \n13.  Following this framework, the TA will have four outputs: \n \n(i)  Output 1: Catastrophe risk profiling of Bangladesh carried out. A risk profile \nwill  be  created  that  (i)  identifies  risks  across  the  two  continuum  of  high \nfrequency\u2013low severity and low frequency\u2013high severity disaster events affecting \nBangladesh, and (ii) indicates several scenarios for likely climate change impacts \non the frequency and intensity of climate-related disaster events over the next 30 \nyears. The TA will draw on existing information and studies carried out by the \ngovernment with support from UNDP and other development partners and will fill \nin gaps to develop a comprehensive risk profile for the nation, districts and/or \ncities and communities, subject to availability of data. The types of disasters to \nbe covered under the TA will be determined based on government priorities and \nlikely cover frequently occurring disasters. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Funding  gaps  for  disaster  response  estimated.  In  estimating \nfunding gaps, the time dimension must also be considered since relief operations \nrequire  resources  that  can  be  mobilized  immediately  after  a  disaster,  while \nrecovery and reconstruction needs require significantly larger resources over the \nlonger run. Therefore, the design of efficient financing solutions must take time \ninto account to ensure that funding requirements are matched with the capacity \nto use funds when required. Moreover, the funding requirements and funding \ngaps will also depend on the government\u2019s own responsibilities in the event of a \ndisaster. This will provide a signal on the part of the risk that will not be covered, \nencouraging those bearing that risk to take precautionary measures. \n(iii)  Output  3:  Detailed  design  of  the  risk  finance  solutions  developed. The \nrange of available solutions includes, among others, contingency budgeting, risk \ninsurance  facilities  (including  microinsurance),  and  capital  market-linked  risk \nfinance solutions (e.g., CAT bonds). Through a broad consultation process led by \nthe government and facilitated by the TA, the TA will review potential options for \nrisk financing solutions and select a set of instruments and interventions for \ninclusion in a medium-term disaster risk financing strategy, based on priority \nneeds, feasibility, and cost-effectiveness. As part of the feasibility analysis, the \nTA will also identify the legal and administrative frameworks necessary to enable \neffective uses of each instrument under consideration. Finally, the TA will provide \npractical road maps for creating the selected instruments (including potential \ninterventions to facilitate market provision of these instruments). \n(iv)  Output  4:  Knowledge-sharing  workshops  on  disaster  risk  finance \nconducted.  In-country  and  regional  workshops  will  be  conducted  on  risk \nfinancing needs and potential solutions. The workshops will also be an integral \npart of the consultation and decision-making for selecting among risk financing \noptions and developing a medium-term strategy for implementing the selected \nsolutions.  In  addition,  knowledge  products,  including  publications,  will  be \nproduced for wider dissemination. The TA will hold consultation discussions with \ninternational reinsurance and capital markets stakeholders for potential public\u2013\nprivate links in disaster risk finance based on strategies developed by the TA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $600,000 of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administrated by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff  and  other  support  activities, \nincluding access to data, as needed. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MFDA,  through  its  Disaster  Management  and  Relief  Division,  will  be  the  executing \nagency. Along with MFDA, the Banks and Financial Institutions Division of the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) will provide guidance and input to the TA, especially for the component on the \ndesign of risk finance instruments. The executing agency will appoint a TA coordinator who will \ncoordinate and supervise the TA consultant team for all outputs. A TA steering committee will \nbe formed, chaired by the secretary of the MFDA\u2019s Disaster Management and Relief Division \nand comprising representatives from (i) the External Relations Division, MOF; (ii) the Banks and \nFinancial Institutions Division, MOF; (iii) the Disaster Management Bureau; (iv) the Planning \nCommission; (v) the CDMP, UNDP; and (vi) the TA coordinator. The TA steering committee will \nmeet at least quarterly to provide necessary inputs and guidance to the TA team. The TA \nconsultant  team  will  coordinate  with  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  on  the \ncomponent for the design of risk finance instruments. It will also consult other institutions, such \nas the Bangladesh Water Development Board, as needed. \n \n16.  The government will provide (i) all relevant documents, data, statistics, information, and \nmaps that are at its disposal; (ii) appropriate and qualified counterpart staff (including the \nprovision of their field per diem and field transportation); (iii) the TA coordinator to be assigned \nbefore  the  consultants\u2019  mobilization;  and  (iv)  logistical  assistance  for  the  workshops  and \nmeetings. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from 31 March 2013 to 31 March 2015. \nThe TA will require approximately 10 person-months of international consultant inputs and 10 \nperson-months of national consultant inputs. The consultants should have expertise in disaster \nrisk finance, disaster risk profiling, public disaster risk finance, the financial sector and capital \nmarkets, public management or disaster risk management, and capacity development and \nknowledge management. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A team of consultants will be \nrecruited  under  one  package  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  with  a \nstandard quality-cost ratio of 80:20. Given the highly complex and technical nature of the \nassignment, the TA requires a full technical proposal for consultant recruitment. The terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  The TA consultant team will organize an in-country information dissemination workshop \nand a regional workshop for the government and other public and private agencies. There will \nalso be information dissemination and consultation meetings with international reinsurance and \ncapital market stakeholders on the TA findings and recommendations. The outputs of the TA will \nbe widely disseminated online as well as through publications. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nCapacity Building for Disaster Risk Finance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved government  An increase in protection  Government annual  Government\u2019s \npreparedness for  coverage by ex ante  budget  sustained commitment \ndisaster relief and  disaster risk finance    to improved disaster \nrehabilitation  solutions from 0% in 2011  Government\u2019s disaster  risk management \nto the equivalent of 0.2% of  risk management profile  structure \ngross domestic product in   \n2015  National Plan for Disaster \nManagement \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nThe government is  An action plan to  National Plan for Disaster  Political commitment to \nbetter positioned and  operationalize various  Management  sustained investments \nequipped to plan  disaster risk finance  in disaster risk \ndisaster relief and  solutions, including  financing \nrehabilitation  contingency budgeting, is \nincorporated into the \nNational Plan for Disaster \nManagement by 2015 \n(baseline: no action plan in \n2012) \n \nOutputs       \n1.
