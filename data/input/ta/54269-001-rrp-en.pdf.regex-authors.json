THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Power Sector Reform Program, and (ii) a proposed policy-based \nloan (PBL) to the Republic of Uzbekistan for subprogram 1 of the Power Sector Reform Program. \n \n2.  The proposed program will provide critical budget support and targeted policy actions \naimed  at  restructuring  the  power  sector  to  enable  competition  and  creating  a  conducive \nenvironment  for  private  investment.  These  measures  will  improve  the  sector\u2019s  financial \nsustainability and ensure adequate investment in critical infrastructure, which will help reboot \neconomic growth and bring new employment opportunities when recovering from the pandemic \ncrisis. Placing the clean energy transition at the center of reforms, the program will accelerate \nmodern, reliable, and clean energy infrastructure to put greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into \nstructural decline. The program will support the government\u2019s ultimate objectives of improving \nquality of life and creating jobs by developing a robust private sector, fully aligned with the country \npartnership strategy for Uzbekistan, 2019\u20132023 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Macroeconomic  context.  Benefiting  from  high  commodity  prices,  Uzbekistan \nexperienced robust economic growth averaging more than 7% in the first part of the 2010s. \nHowever, since 2015, unfavorable external environment conditions, such as declining commodity \nprices and subdued growth of trading partner countries, slowed economic growth from 6.1% in \n2016 to 4.5% in 2017. In response, in 2017, the country initiated comprehensive economic \nreforms  to  stimulate  demand,  foster  foreign  investment,  and  develop  the  private  sector. \nUzbekistan has made good progress on economic reforms while entrenching macroeconomic \nstability. Major structural reforms to date include implementing foreign exchange and tax reforms, \nimproving macro fiscal management, and restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The \ngovernment remains committed to structural reforms to sustain the economic development. \n \n4.  As a result, Uzbekistan maintained sound macroeconomic management leading up to the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, achieving gross domestic product (GDP) growth of \n5.4% in 2018 and 5.6% in 2019. The government has pursued a prudent debt policy, with low \npublic  and  external  debt,  and  large  foreign  exchange  reserves.  In  2019,  public  debt  was \nsustainable, at 29.2% of GDP; and external debt was 43.5% of GDP, with strong foreign exchange \nreserves equivalent to 14 months of imports. The national poverty rate declined from 12.8% in \n2015 to 11.4% in 2018. The fiscal deficit widened from 1.9% of GDP in 2017 to 3.9% of GDP in \n2019  because  of  social  spending  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  structural  reforms.  A  currency \ndevaluation of 48% in 2017, price liberalization, and bank credit growth increased inflation from \n8.8% in 2016 to 17.5% in 2018. Under the inflation-targeting regime, inflation is expected to \ndecrease from 14.5% in 2019 to 12.9% in 2020, with target inflation less than 10% by 2021 and \n5% by 2023. \n \n5.  COVID-19 and the economic shock it has triggered are dramatically changing the short-\nterm  economic  outlook.  Wide-ranging  social  distancing  and  containment  measures  have \nnegatively affected the economy, with GDP growth dropping to 1.5% in 2020, while lower exports \nand remittances widened the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit is projected to increase to 5.6% of \n \n1  ADB. 2019. Country Partnership Strategy: Uzbekistan, 2019\u20122023\u2500Supporting Economic Transformation. Manila. ", "2 \nGDP in 2020 against an earlier estimate of 2.7%. Support from multilateral institutions with \nconcessional loans will help cover fiscal needs and mitigate the impact on foreign exchange \nreserves. A temporary increase in the fiscal deficit to accommodate emergency spending on \nhealth care and social support is appropriate. The macroeconomic policies are expected to \nmaintain Uzbekistan\u2019s fiscal and external sustainability. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nAssessment Letter corroborates this.2 The direction of macroeconomic policies is well aligned \nwith ADB\u2019s requirements for the PBL. \n \n6.  Sector context. Reliable and affordable electricity supply is fundamental for driving \neconomic growth and socioeconomic development. Joint-Stock Company (JSC) Uzbekenergo, \nas a state-owned power utility, was tasked with providing electricity for Uzbekistan with a legally \nendowed monopoly and a vertically integrated supply chain covering generation, transmission, \nand distribution. Without a designated oversight body for the sector, Uzbekenergo undertook the \ncombined functions of planning, investment, day-to-day system operations, and regulation. This \nintegrated monopoly structure faced the challenge of meeting fast-growing power demand against \na backdrop of inadequate investment in the power sector, which has resulted in unreliable service \nand  slow  increases  in generation capacity. In March  2019, to  address  this  challenge,  the \ngovernment embarked on comprehensive reforms\u2014starting from the creation of the Ministry of \nEnergy (MOE) as the lead agency for the sector, and unbundling Uzbekenergo to facilitate \ncompetition and unlock private investment. This reform is a complex process and should be \nguided by a multistep implementation plan, supported by legislation reforms, while working to \nchange the policies designed to address specific development constraints. \n \n7.  COVID-19 impact on sector. COVID-19 has visibly affected Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector. \nElectricity consumption declined 2.1% from the previous year in April 2020 and 5.7% in May 2020. \nIn addition, the government decided to withhold the scheduled tariff increase in April 2020 and \nnot to disconnect consumers for reasons of nonpayment during the pandemic. These measures, \ncombined with the decline in electricity consumption, led to an immediate drop in sector revenue. \nIn June 2020, the government urgently provided liquidity support of SUM750 billion ($73.3 million) \nfor the power sector from its Anti-Crisis Fund to mitigate the impact. While this support helped \nrelieve the financial straits temporarily, the sector is expected to face pressure to maintain \nfinancial liquidity because of the decreased revenue and cash flow. The sector reforms have \nreached a critical juncture, where more financing and targeted policy support are needed to \nmaintain the momentum. \n \n8.  Poor financial sustainability. Uzbekistan\u2019s power sector has grappled to fund new \ninvestments because of its poor financial performance. Uzbekenergo\u2019s financial situation was \nweakened by significant technical losses, ad hoc tariff adjustments and unstructured pricing \npolicy, and poor collection rates. This was compounded by the adverse impact of the currency \ndevaluation in 2017 on its foreign currency debt exposure. Uzbekenergo recorded losses of \n$840 million in 2017, which the government absorbed. While the government has continuously \nrationalized the electricity tariff, with an average adjustment rate of 5.9% during 2007\u20132018, the \naverage electricity tariff remained at 70% of the cost recovery level in 2018 and 81% in 2019. \nWithout adequate tariff adjustments, combined with measures to reduce technical losses and \nimprove collection rates, the fiscal gap in the sector is estimated at $270 million in 2020 and would \nreach $1.05 billion by 2023 (pre-COVID-19 estimate). The lack of creditworthiness limits financing \noptions for the sector, making it completely reliant on limited sovereign financing for major \ninvestments. This, in turn, exacerbates underinvestment in the sector, reinforcing a vicious cycle. \n \n2  The IMF confirmed the sound macroeconomic management and fiscal and debt position of Uzbekistan in the \nInternational Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n9.  Lack of medium-term tariff policy. With ADB assistance, in April 2019, the government \nadopted a new tariff methodology that establishes pricing principles\u2014aimed at full cost recovery \nand adjustment of costs incurred through foreign exchange and other costs beyond the control of \nthe sector companies. Based on this, the government needs to announce a medium-term tariff \nincrease program to remove uncertainties and allow consumers to plan for  a reduction in \nconsumption. In addition, the authority to determine tariffs held by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) \nshould be transferred to an independent regulatory agency, combining technical and economic \nregulatory responsibilities over the sector, and insulated from political interference. Potential tariff \nincreases should be coupled with (i) tariff structure improvements to promote the efficient use of \nelectricity, and (ii) social assistance mechanisms to mitigate the impact on vulnerable groups. \n \n10.  Inadequate  revenue  collection.  The  metering  and  billing  systems  are  inadequate, \noutdated, and susceptible to tampering and potential manipulation of charges by consumers and \ntariff collection officers. The revenue collection rate was less than 80% in 2014. The government \ntook a dual approach of (i) introducing modern smart-metering infrastructure, and (ii) enforcing \npayment discipline through the Bureau of Compulsory Enforcement (BCE) since 2017. These \ncombined efforts improved the collection rate to 95% in 2019. However, the BCE charges a 5% \nfee for the collected revenue by BCE, which flows out of the sector and worsens the sector\u2019s \nfinancial health. In 2019, the revenue loss by BCE charges totaled about $90 million. Nationwide \nsmart-metering infrastructure will address unnecessary cash outflows from the sector while \nensuring the utilities meter, bill, and collect the revenue. This is high on the priority reform agenda.  \n \n11.  Unreliable  electricity  service.  Uzbekistan  is  fully  electrified,  but  the  quality  of  the \nelectricity service is poor and unreliable because of transmission bottlenecks, aging power \ngeneration and distribution assets. In addition, power outages and the quality of service are not \nappropriately monitored, and the sector lacks incentive and/or penalty mechanisms to maintain \nhigh-quality service and protect consumer rights. Unreliable power supply has negatively affected \npeople\u2019s livelihoods and businesses\u2019 profitability. More than 32% of firms in Uzbekistan identify \nthe lack of reliable electricity as a major constraint to doing business and a cause of losses, as \noutages total 3.0% of enterprises\u2019 annual sales, which is worse than the average for Eastern \nEurope and Central Asia.3 Small enterprises suffer more because of the lack of expensive diesel \nback-up generators. This issue is more pronounced in rural and remote areas during winter when \nelectricity demand surges and blackouts are common, lasting 2\u20136 hours a day. Women, as the \nprimary users of electricity in households, are disproportionately affected by the unstable and low \nquality  of  electricity  supply.4 Reliable  power  supply  could  enable  women  to  operate  small \nenterprises and participate in income-generating and community activities.  \n \n12.  Lack of integrated planning. Some 56,500 gigawatt-hours or 88.8% of the electricity \ngenerated in 2019 was from burning fossil fuels, while the rest was from hydropower. The \ncountry\u2019s reliance on natural gas for electricity generation has increased from its share of 82% in \n2010. The energy sector is the predominant source of GHG emissions in Uzbekistan. Power \nsector projects have been identified and implemented in an ad hoc manner\u2014lacking coordination \nwith gas subsector planning, as no single oversight body integrated the power and gas segments. \nThe absence of an integrated energy sector plan often leads to inefficient use of natural gas and \nunderinvestment in critical energy infrastructure. At current natural gas production levels, the \nexisting proven gas reserves would last for only 20 years, making it imperative to shift to a more \nsustainable energy system.5 Despite rich solar and wind resources across the country, Uzbekistan \n \n3  World Bank. 2020.

London. \n ", "4 \nlacks a coordinated policy to incentivize increased solar and wind deployment.6 The country could \nalso benefit from increasing electricity trade with hydro-rich neighboring countries. \n \n13.  Prevalent  energy  inefficiencies.  Uzbekistan  is  the  second  most  energy-intensive \neconomy in Europe and Central Asia, as measured by energy intensity per unit of GDP. The \naverage efficiency of thermal power plants is only 33%, well below the 53%\u201356% average \nefficiency of modern combined cycle gas turbines. A significant part of the distribution lines was \nbuilt during the Soviet era from the 1950s to 1970s, and more than 80% of the distribution lines \nand about one-third of substation transformers are in urgent need of replacement. Losses in the \ntransmission and distribution system in 2019 averaged 17.4%, which is threefold those in the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. District heating is one of \nthe most inefficient segments of the industry. The efficiency of heat generation equipment is 65%\u2013\n70% (the international benchmark is more than 90%) and losses in the heat network reach 40%\u2013\n50% in extreme cases (the international benchmark is less than 15%). \n  \n14.  Inefficiencies emanate from the use of outdated equipment and technologies across the \neconomy.  Agriculture  and  irrigation,  which  account  for  21%  of  electricity  consumption  in \nUzbekistan, rely heavily on old pumping infrastructure\u2014more than 65% of 5,000 pumping stations \nhave exceeded their useful life. The metallurgy, cement, and chemicals industries still operate the \nmost electricity-intensive technologies. The integration of improved energy efficiency in the \nsector\u2019s policy direction will help mainstreaming energy efficiency measures, energy audits, \nenergy-efficient buildings, and upgraded labeling appliances. Implementing policies to improve \nenergy efficiency will be necessary to manage fast-growing electricity demand and meet the \ncountry\u2019s commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.  \n \n15.  Constrained private sector participation. Given the sector\u2019s heavy reliance on limited \nsovereign financing, unlocking private participation is inevitable to ensure adequate investment in \ninfrastructure. The government expects electricity demand to double by 2030, and $26 billion is \nrequired to add 17 gigawatts of generation capacity to meet this.7 However, the unfavorable \nregulatory framework and nascent investment environment have discouraged private sector \nparticipation. The government enacted the Law on Public\u2013Private Partnership (PPP) in 2019 to \nprovide  government  support  and  protect  investors  with  supplementary  legislation.  These \nregulatory  frameworks  and  supporting  programs  need  to  be  tested  with  model  projects. \nMonopolistic regulations, such as prohibiting private generators from accessing the national grid \nand selling electricity, need to be deregulated. Utilities\u2019 lack of experience of private projects, and \npotential political interference in dealing with state-owned off-takers, remain risks.  \n \n16.  Weak governance. The MOF and multiple state committees and commissions shared the \nregulatory responsibility for the sector until 2019, and the role of each entity was not clearly \ndefined.  The  Cabinet  of  Ministers  (COM)  made  policy  decisions  (e.g.,  industry  structure, \nregulation, and the corporate structure of operational entities) at the highest level because of the \nsector\u2019s importance, while the MOF undertook administrative regulation of many operational or \ncommercial  decisions.  The  government\u2019s  policy  formation  and  execution  roles  need  to  be \nreoriented and streamlined, with a dedicated independent regulatory unit for sector regulation. \nDespite attempts to corporatize Uzbekenergo, corporate governance has remained weak. The \nresulting lack of creditworthiness has limited financing options and made Uzbekenergo primarily \nreliant on sovereign financing for capital projects. Reliance on sovereign financing also led to \n \n6  The United Nations Development Programme estimates Uzbekistan to have the following renewable energy \npotential: biomass (800 megawatts [MW]), solar (593,000 MW), wind (1,600 MW), and small hydro (1,800 MW). \nUnited Nations Development Program. 2014.

Little \ninformation on Uzbekenergo\u2019s performance has been disclosed to the public, key performance \nindicators were not monitored closely, and associated incentives and/or penalty mechanisms \nwere absent.  \n \n17.  Previous reform efforts supported by ADB. ADB sector reform support has focused on \nimproving the internal management system and institutional strengthening of Uzbekenergo. \nAchievements include the adoption of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the \ncreation of the center for financial management, and asset revaluation.8 Policy reform support \nbecame necessary to respond to the emerging needs for comprehensive and substantial sector \nreforms.9 Since 2018, ADB support has shifted to the policy reform agenda, including a new tariff \nmethodology, a sector master plan, transaction advisory support for PPP projects, and policy \nadvisory on the power market design. In addition, ADB\u2019s Economic Management Improvement \nProgram, aimed at improving the governance and financial viability of SOEs, helped design and \nimplement the sector reforms, benefiting from ADB\u2019s strong presence in policy dialogue.10 \n \n18.  Lessons. The program draws on lessons from power sector reform initiatives across the \nglobe. Strong government commitment and adequate support from all stakeholders, including key \ndevelopment partners, are critical prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program.11 \nIn addition to the MOE, the MOF and the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade monitor and \nbalance the reforms, while the progress of reforms is regularly reported to the President\u2019s office \nand the COM. In the energy sector, the Ministry of Investment and Foreign Trade has been \neffectively  leading  monthly  coordination  meetings  with  ADB,  the  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the World Bank. This will provide a strong \nmonitoring and evaluation platform for effective continuation of the reform initiatives. Technical \nassistance  (TA)  support  and  policy  advice,  coordinated  across  development  partners  and \nprovided in parallel with budget support programs, can help push the reform agenda and build \ncapacity.12 The program will be supported by ongoing TA and new TA to be provided by Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) including the tariff affordability study.13 \n  \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition  \n  \n19.  The government has a strong reform agenda in the power sector, with the overarching \nreform objectives of restructuring the industry to enable competition and creating a conducive \nenvironment  for  private  investment  in  the  sector.14 In  developing  the  reform  program,  the \ngovernment undertook high-level policy dialogue, monthly development partners coordination \nmeetings, and multiple diagnostic and analytical studies supported by key development partners, \nincluding a sector master plan and new tariff methodology (ADB), an impact study of tariff \nincreases and a power market design study (World Bank), and a power sector decarbonization \n \n8  ADB. 2010.

The  program\u2019s  four  pillars  are  (i)  power  sector  restructured  and  regulation \nstrengthened, (ii) sector financial sustainability improved, (iii) power sector carbon intensity \nreduced, and (iv) demand-side energy efficiency increased. \n \n20.  Reform  area  1:  Power  sector  restructured  and  regulation  strengthened.  Policy \nactions  focus  on  strengthening  the  sector  regulation  and  paving  the  way  for  competition. \nSubprogram  1  will  ensure  that  the  MOE  provides  overall  oversight  of  the  sector  entities, \nharmonizes the sector investment program, and charts the reform direction. In April 2020, the \nMOE adopted a power sector development program, 2020\u20132030, setting a reform road map \ntoward a wholesale market where electricity is traded between generators and resellers. As a \nresult of the sector reform (para. 6), Uzbekenergo was vertically unbundled into three successor \ncompanies: (i) JSC Thermal Power Plants (TPP) for generation, (ii) JSC National Electric Grid of \nUzbekistan (NEGU) for transmission, and (iii) JSC Regional Electric Power Networks (REN) for \ndistribution. Horizontal unbundling was completed, with 10 JSC thermal generation plants under \nJSC TPP, and 14 JSC provincial distribution companies under JSC REN. Vertical unbundling will \nallow each unit to focus on its core mandate without the distraction of balancing its interest against \nother parts of the business, and facilitate greater transparency in financial management and \naccounting for costs. The horizonal unbundling will allow for the entry of new players and create \nan environment where companies compete to provide lower prices. To promote gender equality \nin the energy sector, the MOE adopted a sector policy for promoting gender equality, including \ngender-responsive human resources policies and women-friendly infrastructure in the workplace. \n \n21.  Shares of the unbundled companies were transferred to the Agency for Management of \nState Asset, a state property management unit responsible for performance monitoring and \nprivatization of SOEs. The unbundled companies approved independent supervisory boards and \nnew company charters in line with the corporate governance guidelines of the Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development. ADB is leading the commercialization of distribution \nsubsector, and assisted JSC REN to prepare opening balance and financial statements compliant \nwith the IFRS and to adopt key performance indicators. The World Bank is supporting JSC NEGU \nand the EBRD is supporting JSC TPP. These measures will facilitate the improvement of the \nfinancial management system and corporate governance of unbundled companies. \n \n22.  In subprogram 2, the government plans to amend the Law on Electricity (2009) to approve \na  new  power market  structure,  incorporate the  sector  unbundling,  ensure  commercial  and \ncorporate principles governing the sector, promote the attraction of private investment, and create \nthe  conditions  for  full  deregulation  of  electricity  industry.  Subprogram  2  will  focus  on \ncommercializing the sector SOEs and improving financial management, including adopting the \nIFRS and strengthening corporate governance. The gender policy will be cascaded down to the \nsector SOEs to mainstream gender equality in the sector. \n \n23.  Reform area 2: Sector financial sustainability improved. The objective of this reform \nis to improve the sector\u2019s financial sustainability. The government transferred the responsibility \nfor tariff determination from the MOF to the autonomous tariff commission under the COM to \nstrengthen the independence and transparency of tariff determination (para. 9). To improve \ncollection rates and payment discipline, the government approved a time-bound action plan to roll \nout the smart metering system throughout the country (para. 10). Based on the promising \noutcome of the smart metering projects, the government abolished bill collection by the BCE. The \ngovernment has implemented a program of measures to attract independent power producers \n(IPPs)  through  (i)  a  credit  enhancement  mechanism  to  mitigate  initial  off-taker  risks; \n(ii) establishing  procedures for  the  public  procurement  of IPPs  and  standardizing  bankable \ntransaction structures, and (iii) nondiscriminatory access to the national grid. The transmission \n ", "7 \ncompany, NEGU, is the single buyer of electricity from generators and executes power purchase \nagreements  with  generators.  Considering  the  nascent  domestic  capital  market  and  weak \ncreditworthiness of NEGU, the credit enhancement mechanism and government support program \nfor IPPs will build private sector confidence in Uzbekistan\u2019s power market. Gender equality \nprovisions were extended to private sector projects, with a 5% women employment target in line \nwith the sector gender policy, which will create job opportunities for women. \n \n24.   Subprogram 2 will establish an independent energy regulator for the sector, with the key \nfunctions of tariff determination, licensing, market regulation, and consumer protection. The \nregulator\u2019s independence will preserve stability and continuity in rule setting and avoid political \ninterference  in  business  decisions  and  regulatory  risks.  Further  analytical  studies  will  be \nconducted through the AFD TA to reform the retail tariff mechanism to reduce cross-subsidies \nand protect the vulnerable in 2020\u20132021. Subprogram 2 will focus on implementing renewable \nenergy IPPs to reach at the financial close of 1,000 megawatts (MW) solar and 500 MW wind \nprojects. To allow NEGU to generate enough revenue to pay for the electricity it purchases, the \ngovernment will develop further measures to improve NEGU\u2019s financial viability and de-merge the \ntransmission system operations and the single buyer function. \n \n25.  Reform area 3: Power sector carbon intensity reduced. The objective of this reform is \nto reduce GHG emissions in the electricity supply chain. To this end, the government adopted a \nbroad program to transition to a green economy and decrease the carbon intensity of the economy \nby 10% of the 2010 level by 2030. Policy measures in subprogram 1 comprehensively covered \npower generation, transmission, and distribution. In power generation, the government approved \na national policy to (i) develop solar and wind energy sources to cover more than 15% of electricity \ngeneration  by  2030,  (ii)  retire  old  and  inefficient  5.9-gigawatt  thermal  power  plants,  and \n(iii) increase regional trade with hydro-rich countries. In transmission and distribution, policy \nactions  focused  on  reducing  losses  and  expanding  the  grid  system  to  accommodate  the \nincreasing renewable energy integration. Digitalization of transmission and distribution operations \nwill improve the efficiency and service quality. In distribution, the government approved programs \nto green the distribution networks while improving service quality and reducing losses to 9%: \nsmall-scale distributed renewables and a distribution modernization and loss reduction program. \n \n26.  Subprogram 2 will adopt the revised Nationally Determined Contributions, with improved \nadaptation measures covering the power and gas industries and a climate-resilient hydropower \ndevelopment program for 2020\u20132030. It targets adopting a policy for enhancing climate change \nmanagement for hydropower and increasing regional trade with hydro-rich neighboring countries. \nFor distribution, ADB will assist the government to develop further regulatory frameworks and \ncommercial incentives, such as renewable energy auctions, which will facilitate the penetration of \ndistributed renewable energy for productive use. \n \n27.  Reform area 4: Demand-side energy efficiency increased. Energy efficiency and \nconservation are at the forefront of the government\u2019s energy policy. The objective of this reform \nis to manage the fast-growing electricity demand and defer investment in the power system by \nreducing  wasteful  electricity  consumption  in  the  industry,  residential  segment,  and  public \nbuildings. In subprogram 1, the government approved an energy efficiency road map, focusing \non upgrading regulatory standards to international level, and setting energy-saving targets for \nenergy-intensive enterprises in the oil and gas, metallurgy, chemical, textile, and manufacturing \nindustries. The government also adopted a district heating efficiency improvement program for \n2019\u20132022, focusing on Tashkent City, with a share of 70% of the country\u2019s district heating \nservices. An improved district heating system will help reduce the electricity consumption for \nspace heating in the winter. \n ", "8 \n28.  Energy efficiency requires multisector engagement and broader coordination with different \nsectors  of  the  economy,  such  as  agriculture  and  industry,  and  with  local  government. \nSubprogram 2 will focus on the amendment to the Law on the Rational Use of Energy (1997) and \nthe introduction of an energy conservation data management system to trace energy consumption \nby sector. The adoption of a new energy-labeling system will be followed up on, as this requires \nbroader consultation with other ministries, industries, and consumers. \n \n29.  Choice of programmatic approach. International experience indicates that the design \nof reforms can be sequenced as follows: (i) develop a policy that provides broad reform guidelines, \n(ii) enact legislation to implement the policy, (iii) develop a transparent regulatory framework, \n(iv) unbundle the integrated structure and establish a market, and (v) divest state ownership in \ngeneration  and  distribution.15 Consistent  with  international  good  practice,  the  reforms  are \nsequenced over two subprograms. Subprogram 1 will focus on the formulation of the sector policy \nand guidelines, and changing institutional and human resources structures. Subprogram 2 will \nfocus  on  the  regulatory  and  legal  framework,  a  functioning  power  market  model,  and \nimplementation of the private investment projects. A programmatic approach is appropriate for \nchronologically sequencing the reforms in a multiyear framework and allowing time to yield \nresults. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is uniquely positioned to advise the government on the power \nsector reform from its extensive experience in designing and implementing the power sector \nreforms and PBLs. ADB has helped the government identify key reform actions based on \ninternational power sector reform practices. The program builds on ADB\u2019s strong presence in the \nsector  and  policy  dialogue  built  under  the  Economic  Management  Improvement  Program \n(footnote 10). The PBL, as the first of its kind in Uzbekistan\u2019s energy sector, is critical to support \ncomplex reforms and deepen private investment at a time of high uncertainty and risks. Strong \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners  provided  a  unified  reform  package  to  the \ngovernment. ADB will continue to provide support to implement complex reforms, with the help of \nongoing TA (footnote 13) and programmed TA such as a distributed solar promotion program and \na dedicated TA program for subprogram 2.  \n \n31.  Alignment with Strategy 2030. The program is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, \nparticularly the operational priorities on (i) accelerating progress in gender equality; (ii) tackling \nclimate  change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental \nsustainability; and (iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity.16 The proportion of \nsubprogram 1 attributable to climate mitigation and adaptation is estimated at $125 million, as the \nprogram supports policy and institutional actions for the clean energy transition.17 \n \n32.  Development  partner  coordination.  The  program  benefited  from  the  close  donor \ncoordination and harmonized TA support from ADB, the EBRD, and the World Bank (para. 18). \nThe program was jointly developed with AFD, and AFD helped reorient the policy direction toward \ndecarbonization and climate co-benefits. Following subprogram 1, AFD intends to cofinance \nsubprogram  2.  Under  the  broader  programmatic  and  coordinated  approach,  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency is processing a development policy lending of $200 million for \n2020, targeting energy efficiency and capacity building, which complements the program. The \nWorld Bank is considering an energy sector development policy operation in 2021 to build on this \nprogram and expand the reforms to the hydrocarbon segment. ADB consulted with the IMF \nregarding this program (footnote 2), and ADB has maintained close coordination and consultation \n \n15 World Bank. 2020.

Impacts of the Reform \n \n33.  The program is aligned with the government\u2019s overarching sector development objective: \nsustainable, inclusive, and market-led power sector development facilitated (footnote 14). The \nprogram will have the following effect of the reform: environment conducive to private investment \nand sector sustainability improved.19 The reform measures will improve the sector sustainability \nthrough four channels: (i) rationalization of tariffs to the cost recovery level; (ii) improved revenue \ncollection rates; (iii) reduced losses in the transmission and distribution; and (iv) increased private \ninvestment, which will leave additional fiscal space for public investment in priority areas. \n \n34.  The potential economic gains from the program outputs are expected to lead to additional \nfiscal space estimated at $1.74 billion. These benefits accrue from estimated public budget \nsavings from avoided equity investment in the power generation assets required by 2030 ($1.4 \nbillion), and an additional $344 million of avoided revenue support for the sector from loss \nreduction. Additionally, scaled up renewable generation will help avoid the use of natural gas and \nreduce GHG emissions and the associated social costs of carbon dioxide emissions. The \neconomic value of the saved natural gas is estimated at $1.3 billion, and net carbon dioxide\n \nreductions valued at the social cost of carbon are estimated at $383 million for the next 10 years.20 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n35.  Compared  with  the  pre-COVID-19  estimates  for  2020,  the  government  financing \nrequirements (overall fiscal deficit) are expected to increase from $1.86 billion (2.7% of GDP) to \n$3.26 billion (5.3% of GDP). Of that amount, $1 billion will be used for the Anti-Crisis Fund. The \ngovernment will increase its external borrowing from $1.7 billion to $2.6 billion in 2020, mainly \nfrom  international  financial  institutions  including  ADB\u2019s  COVID-19  Active  Response  and \nExpenditure  Support  Program  ($500 million),  the  proposed  program ($200  million),  budget \nsupport programs of the World Bank ($795 million), the IMF ($375 million), and other development \npartners\u2019 loans (Table 1). The remainder will be borrowed through the domestic government bond \nmarket. \n \nTable 1: Financing Needs and Support for 2020  \n($ million) \n  Before  Adjusted for  Change \n  COVID-19  COVID-19  (%) \nItem  2020  2020 \nGross financing requirement  1,855.5  3,258.2  75.6 \nGross domestic financing  156.2  672.2  330.3 \nGross foreign financinga  1,699. 3  2,586.0  52.2  \n      ADB\u2019s COVID-19 response  600.0 \nCARES Program    500.0   \nCOVID-19 Emergency Response Project (EAL)b    100.0   \n      ADB\u2019s originally programmed and new PBLs  250.0  200.0   \nFinancial Markets Development Program (subprogram 1)c  100.0     \n \n18 ADB. 2020.

The government has requested a regular loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period \nof 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the \naverage maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. AFD will provide \ncollaborative cofinancing for subprogram 1 through a loan of \u20ac150 million. \n \n37.  Debt  sustainability  analysis.  ADB\u2019s  public  debt  sustainability  analysis  indicates \nsustainable public debt and a low risk of debt stress, even in the post-COVID-19 scenario. ADB\u2019s \nanalysis suggests that loans for COVID-19 and this program will increase the outstanding public \ndebt by 13.7% (6.1% from ADB and 7.6% from the IMF and the World Bank). The public debt\u2013\nGDP ratio (excluding public guarantees) is projected to increase from 23.3% in 2019 to 33.3% by \n2021 and to decline steadily to 31.2% by 2024, which will remain below the threshold of 70% for \nlow debt stress. Debt sustainability will not be impaired because the public debt remains low. \nLong-term and highly concessional loans total more than 70% of total debt and keep borrowing \ncosts low. Uzbekistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves position is strong, with more than 50% held \nas gold. The external debt is projected to increase from 43.5% in 2019 to 47.6% in 2021, below \nthe threshold of 55%.21 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n38.  The MOF will be the executing agency of the program, responsible for overall program \nmonitoring and reporting. The MOE will be the implementing agency. Ongoing TA will continue to \nprovide  support  for  the  policy  actions  (footnote  13).  The  programmatic  approach  will  be \nimplemented from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2022. Subprogram 1, implemented from 1 July \n2019 to 31 July 2020, will be disbursed in a single tranche, and the loan closing date is 26 \nFebruary 2021. Subprogram 2 will be implemented from 1 August 2020 to 31 December 2022. \n \n21 The MOF pursues its debt policy in line with the IMF and World Bank recommended threshold of less than 70% for \nthe public debt\u2013GDP ratio and less than 55% for the external debt\u2013GDP ratio.  \n ", "11 \nThe proceeds of the PBL will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n39.  Governance. The government is fully committed to improving the quality of governance \nand mitigating governance risks by strengthening the rule of law and anticorruption measures.22 \nThe 2019 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment showed that the overall \npublic financial management systems are good, with credible budget planning and execution.23 \nNo major fiduciary risks and/or mismanagement of public resources have been identified.24 ADB \nhas supported the implementation of the International Public Sector Accounting Standards based \non a road map developed in 2019. To strengthen risk management and fraud prevention, the \nMOF adopted a risk-based internal audit manual in 2019; and several ministries and/or agencies \nhave strengthened their internal audit units. The Law on Public Procurement, adopted in 2018, is \nbeing improved in line with international good practice. ADB has been supporting corporate \ngovernance improvements based on a road map approved in 2019 and the implementation of the \nIFRS for the unbundled companies. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government. \n \n40.  Poverty and social considerations. Although Uzbekistan has a 100% electrification \nratio, power supply is unreliable and interruptions are frequent. The program will improve the \nquality of electricity services and lower losses. Encouraging private sector investment in the \nenergy sector will increase job opportunities directly and indirectly. Sufficient and stable electricity \nwill expand livelihood options and businesses, boost local economic development, and reduce \npoverty and inequity. As the average household spending is mainly on food products (47.3%) and \nutility services (20.4%), the utility service price increase would have an impact on households. \nThe poverty rate would rise by almost 2% point if the gas and electricity tariff is increased by 20%. \nThe program will assess the affordability of the potential tariff increase and develop social \nprotection measures, such as targeted subsidies and/or a tariff structure to limit the impact on the \nvulnerable groups in consideration of the government\u2019s pilot program for the block tariff.25 The \nadoption of social protection measures will be carefully assessed before subprogram 2. \n \n41.  Gender. The program is categorized some gender elements. It has two key policy actions \nwith strong gender impacts: the MOE has adopted (i) a sector gender policy to promote gender \nequality in the power sector and (ii) gender equality targets for PPP projects. The MOE\u2019s gender \npolicy features (i) a gender assessment for the sector utilities to set baseline for monitoring; \n(ii) anti-sexual harassment, non-discrimination, and equal opportunity policies for the sector; \n(iii) the introduction of a gender management system; (iv) the provision of professional, technical, \nand vocational training for women; and (v) a 5% women employment target for the power sector \nPPP projects. These measures will lead to gender-sensitive decisions and empower women \nthrough new opportunities in the sector. \n \n22 Uzbekistan improved the most among the Commonwealth of Independent States in the \u201cabsence of corruption\u201d \nindicator of the Rule Law Index 2020 (ranked 89th in 2020 and 95th in 2019).

Fiscal risk \nmanagement, including contingent liabilities, is strengthened under the PFM Reform Strategy, 2018\u20132028. \n25 The government pilot tested a block tariff in the Yunusabad district of Tashkent City in 2019\u20132020 to assess the \nimpact of the block tariff. However, the pilot test is suspended due to COVID-19 impact.  \n ", "12 \n42.  Safeguards.
