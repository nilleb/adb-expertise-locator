THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) Strategic Climate Fund (SCF),1 both to the Republic of the Maldives for the Preparing \nOuter Islands for Sustainable Energy Development Project.2  \n \n2.  The project will replace inefficient diesel-based power generation grids on the islands \nwith hybrid (renewable energy and diesel) systems and contribute to reductions in the cost of \nelectricity, the subsidy burden on the government budget, and emissions.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Maldives is an archipelago 750 kilometers southwest of Sri Lanka with 26 atolls4 \nand a total land area of about 300 square kilometers. About half the country\u2019s population lives \non the outer islands5.The Maldives has about 141 megawatts (MW) of installed diesel-based \n \ngeneration capacity on the inhabited islands and another 105 MW on the resort islands. While \nthe Maldives has the unique distinction of being the first and only country in South Asia with \n100% access to electricity, this achievement has come at a cost. Given the geographic spread, \neach island is electrified with its own diesel-powered grid system, resulting in expensive and not \nvery reliable supply. The cost of diesel power is unaffordable at 30 cents\u201370 cents per kilowatt-\nhour (depending on the island) and requires government subsidies in excess of $40 million \nannually. Electricity-related subsidies are also a focus area for more robust management of \ngovernment expenditures. In 2012, the Maldives spent over $470 million on oil imports, a large \nshare of it being fuel for electricity generation.6 The 100% diesel dependence of the Maldives \nalso makes its carbon emissions per unit of electricity among the highest in the region. The \nState Electricity Company (STELCO) and FENAKA Corporation Limited (FENAKA) are the main \nelectricity utilities responsible for supplying electricity to the communities of inhabited islands, \nexcept a few where island councils are still responsible for electricity supply. \n \n4.  The Maldives has significant renewable energy resources, i.e., the potential to generate \nsolar power and, in some pockets, wind power. Energy sector studies show that the cost of \nenergy generation from hybrid (renewable energy and fossil fuel) systems would be significantly \nlower than the existing options. The transition to renewable energy has a sound economic \nrationale. The government\u2019s effort to increase electricity production from indigenous sources, \nincluding solar and wind, to enhance energy security will reduce the pressure on the balance of \npayments  and  improve  the  fiscal  position.  The  government  has  initiated  two  programs\u2014 \nPreparing  Outer  Islands  for  Sustainable  Energy  Development  (POISED)  and  Accelerating \nSustainable Private Investments in Renewable Energy (ASPIRE) to support energy efficiency \nand renewable energy investments. \n                                                \n1  Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the Strategic Climate \nFund. \n2  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for Preparing the Outer Islands for Sustainable Energy \nDevelopment Project (TA 8268-MLD). \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n4  The Maldives has 1,192 islands, of which about 194 islands are inhabited. \n5  Outer lslands are the islands in the atolls outside the greater Male region. \n6  The Maldives is considered one of the country\u2019s most vulnerable to oil price fluctuations, with oil imports close to \n35% of gross domestic product in 2012. ", "2   \n \n5.  The proposed project on the outer islands would transform the existing grids through \nphysical investments in renewable energy, energy management and control systems, energy \nstorage, and improvements in distribution networks, and significantly reduce the need for diesel \nto generate electricity. Private sector investments to support solar photovoltaic interventions on \nlarger  islands  (initially  planned  for  STELCO)  are  under  consideration  outside,  and \ncomplementary to, the project. In addition, the government is expected to support a low carbon \nenergy pathway in the private tourist islands over the medium term through policy measures \nand investment interventions supported by ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department and \nthe SCF. ADB will also support the utilities\u2019 demand-side management interventions through \nfuture technical assistance (TA). \n \n6.  The government has a national energy policy to support the development of the energy \nsector. ADB policy dialogue has been supporting development of the energy sector including \nthe development of a medium term road map and investment plan. The capacity of institutions \nsuch as the Maldives Energy Authority (MEA), the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEE), \nand  the  utilities  is  also  progressively  being  strengthened7 to  enable  implementation.  This \nincludes  MEA  developing  and  issuing  regulations  to  approve  investment  plans,  operator \nlicensing and consumer tariffs and implementing them by June 2015. Also MEA will approve a \ngrid  code  to  ensure  successful  operation  of  the  facilities  installed  under  the  project.  The \ngovernance  of  STELCO  and  FENAKA  will  also  be  improved  with  measures  including  the \nappointment of independent directors with technical, legal and financial expertise.  The project is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of supporting sustainable energy growth, \nits Energy Policy, and its country operations business plan for the Maldives for 2013\u20132015.8 \nBased on the government\u2019s investment plan for the outer islands and the characteristics of the \nelectricity systems, a sector project approach is considered best suited to support the transition \nof those islands that meet the eligibility criteria, as defined in the project administration manual \n(PAM).9 \n \n7.  Lessons learned from ongoing projects. ADB\u2019s operations in the energy sector since \n1985 were instrumental in meeting electricity demand in the capital of Mal\u00e9 and for building \ncapacity in STELCO. From 2002, ADB supported the outer islands electrification project, which \nprovided diesel generators and grid investments on 19 islands.10  Several lessons from earlier \noperations suggest the need for (i) ADB\u2019s collaboration with other development partners to \nleverage existing resources; (ii) detailed technical, economic, and financial appraisal of projects \nprior to approval; (iii) technical support to strengthen institutions such as MEA. The project \ndesign incorporates these lessons. Since the project uses a sector approach, detailed design \nhas been carried out for a sample of five islands representing all the inhabited islands. This \nsample will be the first to be implemented. Parallel cofinancing has been sought from multiple \npartners, and the integration of outer islands into the jurisdiction of one agency will facilitate \nprocurement as well as standard practices for financial management. Since 2012, ADB has \nbeen supporting the MEA in preparing technical codes and standards as well as regulations for \nthe electricity sector, including renewable energy investments. A consulting firm will support the \nproject management unit (PMU) in screening, doing surveys, preparing bidding documents, \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2011.

The  implementation  and \ndisbursement schedules are realistic and take into account difficulties met in previous project \nimplementation in the Maldives. \n \n8.  Coordination  with  other  donors.  The  project  has  evolved  from  a  smaller  project \nplanned under a medium-term investment plan prepared by the Maldives in 2012. Since then, \nseveral donors such as the Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the European Investment Bank \n(EIB), and other bilateral agencies have expressed interest in cofinancing the project alongside \nADB. The project components are complementary to operations of the World Bank Group11 \nplanned for 2014 and 2015, and a proposed pilot project planned in Addu City through the new \nfund for Joint Crediting Mechanism of the Government of Japan.12 The investments in the \ndistribution grid, control systems, diesel generators, and energy storage devices financed under \nthe project by ADB and its partners would facilitate more efficient operation and enable the \nutilities to achieve the proposed fuel-saving targets. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be a more sustainable energy sector based on renewable \nresources, to be achieved by 2022. The outcome will be a shift towards clean and cost-effective \nenergy sources by 2019.13 \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project has two outputs: (i) renewable-energy-ready grid systems developed for \nouter  islands  and  greater  Male  region;  and  (ii) enhanced  capacity  of  MEE,  STELCO,  and \nFENAKA to implement renewable energy grid interventions. \n \n11.  Output 1 includes the design and installation of equipment for solar\u2013diesel hybrid grids \non about 160 islands. It will begin in the second half of 2014 with investments in five sample \nsubprojects and a control center, to be scaled up to other islands according to eligibility criteria. \nCapacity building under output 2 covers roadmap implementation including procurement, project \nmanagement, technical and financial management, gender and safeguard support, and training; \nthis will start in 2014 and last for the duration of the project. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $124 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \n                                                \n11 The World Bank is supporting the initial phase of a private sector solar photovoltaic investment on four islands in \nGreater Mal\u00e9 and designing a partial risk guarantee product for private sector investment in renewable energy. \n12 ADB. 2014.

The Government of the Maldives has requested a grant14 not exceeding $38.0 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance part of output 1 and output 2 of the project. \nThe financing plan is in Table 2. The ADB SCF15 will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $12 \nmillion, to be administered by ADB. The government will provide these funds to STELCO and \nFENAKA on terms and conditions acceptable to ADB. IDB16 and EIB17 have expressed interest \nin cofinancing the project on a parallel basis.18 IDB is expected to provide a loan in the amount \nof $10 million, for a period of 20 years with an administrative charge not exceeding 2% during \nproject implementation. EIB is expected to provide a loan in the amount of $50 million for 15 \nyears at an interest rate of 61 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. IDB and EIB \nloans will be onlent by the government to STELCO and FENAKA on terms and conditions \nacceptable to these agencies for investments in the islands. The government will provide $14 \nmillion  of  counterpart  financing  to  procure  and  install  efficient  diesel  generation  sets  and \ndistribution networks as well as cover applicable taxes and duties. \n \n                                                \n14 A country's eligibility for Asian Development Fund (ADF) grants under the revised grant framework is determined \nby its risk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis determined that the Maldives has a high risk of \ndebt distress and is therefore eligible to receive 100% of its ADF allocation as grants. \n15 Under the Scaling Up Renewable Energy Program in Low-Income Countries financed by the Strategic Climate \nFund. Administered by ADB. In 2012, the SCF endorsed the investment plan submitted by the Government of the \nMaldives requesting a $12.0 million grant to be administered by ADB for the project. The project preparatory TA \nreceived $0.7 million of grant financing in 2012 from the SCF to develop the components. In accordance with \nestablished Climate Investment Fund procedures, SCF approval for the project was received in July 2014 after \nADB\u2019s staff review meeting on the project.  \n16 In 2012, IDB and ADB signed minutes of meetings to work together to support a renewable energy sector project in \nthe Maldives. This was further discussed in 2014 during the IDB country programming mission to Maldives. \n17 In 2013, EIB indicated interest in cofinancing the project and channeling the funds through the Bank of Maldives. A \ncommunication in this regard was sent from EIB to the Ministry of Finance and Treasury in the Maldives.  \n18 On 7 May 2014, the Cabinet of the Republic of the Maldives expressed interest in receiving loans from EIB and \nIDB for the project. This will enable processing of these loans. The Parliament of the Maldives will need to give final \napproval to any borrowings.

Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT) will be the executing agency. A PMU \ncomprising officials from MEE, FENAKA, and STELCO has been set up to coordinate project \nactivities.  MEE,  FENAKA,  and  STELCO  will  be  the  key  implementing  agencies.  Project \nagreements will be entered into with FENAKA and STELCO. The PMU will be strengthened with \nexternal experts in the areas of finance, technology, and contract management. The PMU will \nbe responsible for organizing training programs to build the institutional capacity of FENAKA \nand  STELCO  and  will  be  responsible  for  monitoring  the  implementation.  The  project \ndepartments of FENAKA and STELCO, headed by project directors, will act as the project \nimplementation units (PIUs) with adequate staff to assist in preparing and implementing the \noverall implementation plan, bid management, and budgeting. The project implementation units \nwill  also  be  responsible  for  overall  intra-agency  coordination.  PIUs  will  provide  project \nimplementation support to contractors and will liaise with the islands where the project will be \nimplemented.  \n \n15.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in  four  phases.  Feasibility  studies  of  five  sample \nsubprojects for the islands of S. Addu, B. Goidhoo, Th. Buruni, Ga. Vilingili, and Lh. Khurendhoo \nhave  been  completed.  These  will  be  the  first  subprojects  for  which  procurement  and \nimplementation will start in late 2014 (under phase 1). The PMU team has been established in \n2014  and  functional  experts  in  technical,  financial  management,  procurement,  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards will also be identified to support the PMU for the review of the design \nand the implementation of the solar\u2013diesel hybrid grids on the five islands. Implementation of \nsubprojects under subsequent phases will involve replacement of diesel generator sets and \ngrids, as well as installation of solar photovoltaic and energy storage equipment, and would be \ndone  atoll  by  atoll  based  on  the  proposed  eligibility  and  selection  criteria.  Bid  document \npreparation for phase 2 will start in 2015, for phase 3 in 2016, and for phase 4 in 2017. An atoll-\nby-atoll  approach  is  preferred  for  future  subprojects  as  it  allows  better  planning  and \nimplementation efficiencies (footnote 10). ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time) would be followed for procurement of ADB-financed and ADB-administered \nsubprojects.19 The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in \ndetail in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \n16.  The World  Bank  supported  ASPIRE  program  will  provide  partial  risk guarantees to \nprivate sector investors in solar photovoltaic systems in the Maldives and is expected to be \nrolled out in 2015 starting with the area serviced by STELCO. In addition, the World Bank is also \n                                                \n19 On 18 March 2013, the ADB Board of Directors approved a blanket waiver of member country procurement \neligibility restrictions in cofinanced ADF operations. \n ", "6   \ndesigning  a  project  to  support  solar  photovoltaic  installations  in  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  region \nserviced by STELCO. The readiness of the existing grid on STELCO islands may need to be \nenhanced to successfully integrate solar energy and reduce diesel consumption and required \ncoordination with the World Bank project program would be taken up by the PMU. Further, \nongoing capacity development TA to MEE and MEA (footnote 7) to support the formulation of \nkey regulations, facilitate private sector investment, and meet key sector objectives will continue \nwith support from the SCF.20 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  June 2014\u2013December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2019 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee comprising state ministers (finance and \ntreasury, environment and energy, economic development) of the \nGovernment of the Maldives, Head of Maldives Energy Authority; \nand Managing Directors of FENAKA and STELCO \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury, Government of the Maldives \n(iii) Key implementing agencies  MEE, FENAKA, and STELCO \n(iv) Implementation unit  Project management unit located at MEE, seven staff proposed; \nproject implementation units at STELCO and FENAKA \nProcurement  International  Six contracts (under ADB)  $44 million \ncompetitive bidding  EIB and IDB to follow own \nprocurement guidelines \nNational competitive  none   \nbidding \n     \nConsulting services  QCBS  Firm-based contract  $3 million \nRetroactive financing and/or  Retroactive financing to be requested for eligible expenditure on \nadvance contracting  equipment, civil works, and implementation services, not exceeding \nthe amount of 20% of the estimates, incurred before grant \neffectiveness but not earlier than 12 months before the signing of \nthe grant agreement. \nAdvance contracting was approved in July 2014 \nDisbursement  The grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to \ntime) and detailed arrangements agreed upon between the \ngovernment and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, EIB = European Investment Bank, FENAKA = FENAKA Corporation Limited, IDB = \nIslamic Development Bank, MEE = Ministry of Environment and Energy, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, \nSTELCO = State Electricity Company. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n17.  The PMU staff will be responsible for screening and due diligence on whether proposed \nsubprojects meet the eligibility criteria for the project and will report to ADB. The government \nhas been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting and retroactive financing in \nprinciple does not commit ADB to finance the project. \n \n                                                \n20 The SCF approved about $0.4 million in 2014 to support MEE and MEA in periodic updates of the sector road map \nand investment plan, environmental management guidelines, private sector investment support, and productive \nenergy end use. ", "    7 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n18.  The project is considered viable based on due diligence and an assessment of the costs, \nbenefits, and impacts. It will benefit the islands of the Maldives with the availability of cheaper, \ncleaner, and more reliable power. It also will reduce the subsidy burden on the government and \nallow more financing of key social priorities. The main benefit to the country\u2019s economy will be \naccrued in the form of reduced diesel imports, which will have a significant positive impact on \nthe country\u2019s balance of payments. \n \nA.  Technical \n19.  The government has a national energy policy and a sector road map to convert islands\u2019 \nelectricity grids to hybrid (renewable energy and diesel) systems. Islands are classified based \non the existing cost of electricity and economic level of renewable energy penetration. Detailed \nstudies were conducted for a representative sample of islands using an energy planning model \nthat optimizes the use of different energy sources for electricity generation, including renewable \nenergy such as wind and solar power.21 Also, the analysis has been extrapolated to cover the \nentire group of inhabited islands in the Maldives. An investment plan has been developed for \nislands covered by FENAKA and for some of those covered by STELCO that could have \ninterventions under the project. The road map is viable, and technologies have been selected \nbased  on  operational  requirements,  local  conditions,  and  capacity  for  operation  and \nmaintenance on remote islands. The procurement and implementation experience from the \nproject\u2019s first set of islands in 2015 will provide useful information for the structuring of future \nprocurement. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n20.  The project has been analyzed for economic viability using a with- and without-project \napproach in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.22 The \nproject is economically viable with benefits outweighing the costs. The economic internal rates \nof return (EIRRs) of the five sample subprojects range from 14.00% to 40.17%, while the \nbenefit\u2013cost ratios range from 1.06 to 1.40. The combined sample has an EIRR of 31.32%. \nSensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  project  returns  are  robust  against  changes  in  critical \nvariables, with a minimum EIRR of 11.5% in the worst-case scenario of 20% escalation in \ncapital costs.23 The project components will support reduced diesel consumption per unit of \nelectricity  sold  by  replacing  diesel  generation  sets  and  grids  on  nearly  160  islands  and \ngenerating 21 MW of solar power. The project will support a reduction of 40,000 tons of carbon \ndioxide by 2019 against the baseline emissions in the energy sector. \n \n21.  Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial \nManagement  and  Analysis  of  Projects.24 All  financial  costs  and  benefits  are  expressed  in \nconstant 2014 prices. The weighted average cost of capital was estimated at 1.2% (in after-tax \nreal terms). Based on conservative assumptions adopted for the base-case analysis\u2014a 1.39% \n                                                \n21 HOMER, originally designed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the United States, is a computer \nmodel that simplifies the task of designing microgrids that combine traditionally generated power, renewable \npower, energy storage and load management. Its optimization algorithm allows evaluation of the economic and \ntechnical feasibility of a large number of technology options and to account for variations in technology costs and \nenergy resource availability. \n22 ADB. 1997.

Sensitivity \nanalysis shows that the project returns are robust against changes in critical variables and \nexceed the WACC. \n \nC.  Governance \n22.  Financial  management,  procurement,  anticorruption,  policy  and  legal,  capacity,  and \nother institutional issues and mechanisms were assessed during the project preparatory TA. \nThe PMU will report to an interministerial technical steering committee comprising the state \nministers of finance and treasury, environment and energy, and economic development. The \nfinancial management risk is rated high, and a road map for the rollout of the project\u2014including \ninvestment planning, institutional development, governance, and financial management\u2014has \nbeen agreed with the government. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government, STELCO, and FENAKA. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 9). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n23.  Poverty reduction and social issues were reviewed for subprojects during the project \npreparatory  TA.  The  project  will  ensure  several  direct  benefits  to  communities:  (i)  use  of \nrenewable  energy  sources  available  on  islands,  (ii)  sustainable  energy  and  economic \ndevelopment,  (iii)  energy  supply  to  homes  and  for  productive  energy  use,  (iv)  livelihood \ndevelopment through poverty reduction and improvement in the quality of life, and (v) capacity \ndevelopment opportunities for women groups. \n \nE.  Gender Development \n24.  Gender  issues  and  opportunities  for  mainstreaming  were  also  considered  in  the \npreparation of the project based on the due diligence carried out for the five sample islands. The \nproject  is  designed  to  be  classified  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  A  gender  action \nframework (GAF), which integrates indicators and targets in the project design and monitoring \nframework, has been prepared. The GAF has the following key outputs: (i) household demand-\nside  management  program  to  improve  energy  efficiency,  targeting  women  household \nconsumers who will link up with and further develop FENAKA\u2019s community outreach program; \n(ii) creation of an enabling environment for developing women\u2019s microenterprises; (iii) promotion \nof  women\u2019s  employment  and  training  during  subproject  construction,  and  operation  and \nmaintenance of the electricity assets on the islands; (iv) training for FENAKA and STELCO staff \nin  gender-inclusive  community  outreach  approaches;  and  (v)  a  gender-mainstreamed \nmanagement  system  to  be  designed  and  implemented.  The  island  women\u2019s  development \ncommittees will be mobilized for community outreach and awareness-raising activities. Social \ndevelopment specialist services in gender and development will be recruited to support the \nutilities in implementing the GAF. The project will promote and advocate a socially inclusive, \ngender equitable, and nondiscriminatory work environment and practices. Practices will be \nconsistent with core labor standards. The project will minimize the risk of HIV/AIDS through \ninformation dissemination campaigns in project areas. MEE, though the PMU, will determine a \ngender focal point to coordinate all gender-related activities. \n \n                                                \n25 World Energy Outlook current scenario.

An environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework,  and  an  initial  environmental  examination  with  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP) for the sample subprojects were prepared according to \nADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009)  and  in  line  with  OM/F1,26 the  government\u2019s \nenvironmental impact assessment guidelines, and related national policies and legislation. The \nactivities proposed under the project will result in limited environmental impacts, restricted \nmostly to construction and operation. Adequate mitigation measures have been incorporated \ninto the EMP. Public consultation and information disclosure requirements have been met. \nMeasures for the executing agency\u2019s and the implementing agencies\u2019 capacity enhancement for \nimplementation of the EMP are also included in the initial environmental examination. The solar \nphotovoltaic systems financed by the project will be mounted on structures of 3 meter\u20134 meter \nheight,  and  other  project  facilities  are  expected  to  be  resilient  to  climate  change  through \ncompact and preassembled systems resistant to extreme weather conditions. \n \n26.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and C for indigenous peoples. Due diligence conducted \non sample subprojects showed no resettlement impacts and no adverse impacts on indigenous \ngroups.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  project.  If  any  changes  or \nadditional land requirements or involuntary resettlement impacts emerge during implementation \nof a subproject, a resettlement plan will be prepared or modified according to the applicable \nlaws  referred  to  in  the  resettlement  framework.  ADB\u2019s  approval  will  be  obtained  before \nimplementation of the subproject continues. The social and environmental safeguards will be \nconducted by FENAKA and STELCO, assisted by the PMU. \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n27.  The overall benefits of the project and its positive impact on the country\u2019s development \nefforts including the contribution to climate change mitigation are expected to outweigh the \ninvestment costs. The project has incorporated measures to overcome all the major risks during \nproject implementation. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.27 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMore than expected increase in  Demand-side energy-efficiency measures to be supported, such \nelectricity demand could offset the  as through ongoing sources of bilateral funding.
