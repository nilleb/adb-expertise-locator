INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will continue support for capacity \nbuilding of the central banks and financial regulators of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN) to realize financial integration under the ASEAN Economic Community. The TA \nwill provide capacity building programs to Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMyanmar, and Viet Nam (CLMV),1 in coordination with the South East Asian Central Banks \nResearch and Training Centre (SEACEN),2 and through regional knowledge sharing with peer \nASEAN  central  banks.  The  capacity  building  programs  will  be  developed  under  the  close \nguidance of the Steering Committee for Capacity Building Initiatives to Support ASEAN Financial \nIntegration (SCCB) and the ASEAN Senior Level Committee on Financial Integration (SLC).3  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved annual work program of the Financial \nCooperation and Integration team under the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment (ERCD).4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025 is envisioned \u201cto create a deeply \nintegrated and highly cohesive ASEAN economy that would support sustained high economic \ngrowth and resilience even in the face of global economic shocks and volatilities.\u201d5 However, \nsubstantial development gaps among ASEAN member states stand in the way of the integration. \nInadequate capacity and financial infrastructure would be a potential cause of instability when the \nmarkets are integrated. The ASEAN central banks strongly believe that capacity building is of \nutmost importance in narrowing these development gaps and assisting all ASEAN members to \nfully participate in the ongoing financial integration efforts.6 The ASEAN Economic Community \nBlueprint 2025 clearly states that capacity building\u2014together with capital account liberalization \nand payment and settlement systems\u2014is one of three important cross-cutting areas.  \n \n4.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) co-chairs the SCCB and provide financial and \nintellectual support to ASEAN central banks. Ongoing ADB-funded TA supports both expansion \nof knowledge and skills and sharing of experiences among the ASEAN central banks, which \n                                                \n1  Brunei Darussalam may join the capacity building programs under this TA, but the travel expenses of participants will \nnot be covered by ADB.  \n2  SEACEN. http://www.seacen.org/content.php?id=3&lang=1.htm.  \n3  SCCB was formed in March 2013 with the recognition that capacity gaps would impede financial integration; ADB \nand SEACEN co-chair the SCCB. The SLC, which comprises the ASEAN central bank deputy governors, receives \nprogress reports from various subsector working committees, including the SCCB; evaluates the status of financial \nintegration; and provides guidance accordingly. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2017  \n5  ASEAN Secretariat. 2015. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025. Jakarta, p. 2. Implementation of the \nprevious blueprint\u2014ASEAN Secretariat. 2008. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint\u2014has been substantively \nachieved, particularly with respect to eliminating tariffs and facilitating trade. The ASEAN Economic Community \nBlueprint 2025 seeks to achieve the vision of building, by 2025, an ASEAN economic community that (i) is highly \nintegrated and cohesive; (ii) is competitive, innovative and dynamic; (iii) displays enhanced connectivity and sectoral \ncooperation; (iv) is more resilient and inclusive, and is oriented and centered on people; and (v) is integrated with the \nglobal economy. \n6  The importance of capacity building was clearly recognized by the ASEAN central banks, as shown in the summary \nreport: ADB. 2013. The Road to ASEAN Financial Integration: A Combined Study on Assessing the Financial \nLandscape and Formulating Milestones for Monetary and Financial Integration in ASEAN. Manila.  \n \n ", "2 \n \nconstitute successful peer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing.7 Flexible arrangements for \nbilateral learning programs introduced in the ongoing TA have fostered closer communication \nbetween the central banks of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand and \nCLMV. In particular, bilateral study visits by the National Bank of Cambodia to the Bank Negara \nMalaysia and Monetary Authority of Singapore to learn their deposit protection schemes were \nlinked with the Inclusive Financial Sector Development Program in Cambodia under ADB\u2019s \nSoutheast Asia Department. The capacity building has been coordinated by the SCCB and closely \nmonitored by the SLC, along with the ASEAN Banking Integration Framework learning roadmap \ndeveloped by the central banks in conjunction with ADB and SEACEN. The roadmap shows the \nregulatory capacity needed for ASEAN financial integration, and was referenced by CLMV central \nbanks in assessing their capacity building achievements and potential needs. Based on the \nsuccessful implementation of the ongoing TA, and the need to further narrow capacity gaps, the \nco-chairs of the ASEAN SLC requested continued ADB support for the ASEAN initiatives.8 The \nASEAN central banks expressed their wish to partner with ADB on an ongoing basis to realize \nASEAN financial integration.  \n \n5.  In response to the strong request from ASEAN central banks, the proposed TA will \ncontinue  capacity  building  support  to  CLMV  central  banks  based  on  the  ASEAN  Banking \nIntegration  Framework  learning  roadmap  and  the  roadmaps  developed  by  the  working \ncommittees  and  endorsed  by  the  SLC\u2014addressing  capital  market  development,  financial \nservices liberalization, capital account liberalization, payment settlement systems, and financial \ninclusion\u2014with close guidance and monitoring by the SCCB and SLC.9 The TA will support two \nbroad categories of capacity building programs: (i) customized training programs, which are \nspecifically proposed by CLMV central banks, and are to be implemented by ADB and SEACEN; \nand (ii) tailored bilateral programs, which are provided by ASEAN central banks themselves as \npeer-to-peer learning and knowledge sharing through training programs and/or study visits of  \nCLMV central bank officers to central banks of Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and \nThailand.   \n \n6.  The  TA  will  improve  organizational  capacity  and  knowledge,  including  on  banking \nregulations  and  supervision,  market  monitoring,  central  bank  operations,  financial  stability, \npayment and settlement systems, and new technologies in the banking sector. Compared to the \nexisting capacity building program TA (footnote 7), this TA will endeavor to accommodate more \nflexible arrangements for capacity building based on the specific needs of each country.  Each \nCLMV central bank institution will submit an annual capacity building plan. To facilitate this, a \ntemplate will be created for the capacity building plan that will provide a menu of training topics \nand/or themes aligned with each working committee\u2019s strategic action plan, key performance \nindicators, and learning roadmaps. The template will allow for suggestions on how to effectively \nconduct the training and for proposals on the number of staff to be trained for each program. ADB \nwill review the capacity building plans and determine whether training will be provided through a \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building in Support of Monetary and Financial Integration of the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations. Manila. A total of 14 bilateral study visits and/or training programs for 82 \nCLMV staff and 5 customized programs for 110 staff were supported in 2016. In 2017, 19 bilateral programs and 6 \ncustomized learning courses for about 260 staff are expected to be supported by ADB. A minor change in TA scope \nwas made to support travel costs associated with the customized learning programs in 2017. \n8  The request was made by Perry Warjiyo, the deputy governor of Bank Indonesia and Diwa Guinigundo, deputy \ngovernor of Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas as co-chairs of ASEAN SLC in a letter to ADB vice-president Bambang \nSusantono on 15 May 2017. \n9  The ASEAN Banking Integration Framework Learning Roadmap consists of four layers: layer 1 addresses the basic \nknowledge of financial markets, layer 2 addresses various risks of the business of banking, layer 3 involves banking \nbusiness lines and interactions with submarkets, and layer 4 focuses on systemic risk and financial stability. Each \nlayer is divided into several modules. Under the current roadmap there are 22 basic modules. \n ", "3 \n \ncustomized  or  tailored-bilateral  program.  To  the  extent  possible,  training  programs  will  be \nconducted through visits by resource persons to CLMV central banks, rather than at separate \ntraining venues; this will result in travel cost savings, and avoid limits on the number of participants. \nTo take advantage of their expertise, ASEAN working committees will be requested to identify \npossible resource persons. CLMV central bank institutions will submit impact assessment reports \nto the SCCB in an effort to enhance evaluations of the effectiveness of each TA training program. \nThe evaluations will address the strategic action plan, key performance indicators, and learning \nroadmap of each working committee. \n \n7.  In recognition of the fact that financial integration requires support for systems and \ninfrastructure to effectively link markets, as well as human capacity building, the TA is expected \nto lead to further discussions on institution building that may be funded by ADB loans, such as \ncreation of market infrastructure in CLMV. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: effective strategies and projects to achieve \nASEAN financial integration developed and implemented by the ASEAN central banks. The TA \nwill have the following outcome: improved organizational capacity and knowledge among CLMV \ncentral bank staff. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: New capacity building programs developed and conducted. The proposed \nTA will support at least 40 training courses for about 400 staff and officers, and visits of resource \npersons from the 6 working committees to the CLMV. Additional learning roadmaps will be \nprepared to identify further capacity development needs. Lessons from the programs conducted \nunder the ongoing TA (footnote 7) will be used in developing the new roadmaps in consultation \nwith the SCCB. \n \n10.  Output 2: Enhanced web portal of the steering committee for capacity building \ninitiatives. The SCCB web portal, which serves as the online repository for the capacity building \nlearning materials, will be enhanced for easier pre-and post-course information sharing among \nparticipants. Members will have easy access to share and post their thoughts and ideas for other \nSCCB members. This will be an access-controlled portal to share materials among ASEAN \ncentral bank officials. The enhancement of the SCCB web portal will take advantage of Yammer, \nan ADB platform; enhancement of the website will be undertaken by ADB\u2019s Office of Information \nSystems and Technology, and no additional funds will be allocated for this project.  \n \n11.  The SCCB co-chaired by ADB will continue to monitor the TA project\u2019s effectiveness \nbased on the learning roadmaps and will report this to the SLC at least twice per year. The SLC \nwill review the progress reports submitted by the SCCB in the context of achieving ASEAN \nfinancial integration and provide appropriate guidance for the SCCB, which will then be reported \nto ASEAN central bank governors. \n  \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from January 2018 to December 2019. ADB \nwill be the executing agency of the TA.  The Financial Cooperation and Integration team in ADB\u2019s \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will be responsible for implementing \nand administering the TA, organizing capacity building training and/or events, and engaging \nconsultants. ADB will obtain a no-objection in writing from the relevant ASEAN member country \nprior to conducting or financing any activities related to this TA in the territory of that ASEAN \nmember country. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013December 2019 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  ERCD, ADB. The TA will be implemented with close coordination with ASEAN \ncentral banks under the SCCB. SCCB meetings will be held at least twice per \nyear to monitor progresses of capacity building, which will be reported to the \nSLC for further guidance. The SLC will discuss and evaluate the status of \nfinancial integration and readiness based on the progress reports from various \nsubsector working committees, task forces, and the SCCB. If further human \nresource capacity building is necessary, the SLC will provide guidance to the \nSCCB.  \nStrong collaboration with ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department will be essential \nto ensure success of the TA.  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB.a \nIndividual international  5 person-months, intermittent  $100,000 \nconsultancy  \nIndividual national consultancy  24 person-months, full-time  $72,000 \nResource persons  7 person-months  $30,200 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ASEAN = Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ERCD = Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department, SCCB = Steering Committee for Capacity Building Initiatives to Support the ASEAN \nFinancial Integration, SLC = ASEAN Senior Level Committee on Financial Integration, TA = technical assistance. \na Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3).  \nSource: ADB.  \n \n14.
