Justification \n1.  Project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required in order to (i) help select \ntarget roads, (ii) prepare basic engineering designs, (iii) conduct ADB\u2019s due diligence in financial, \nsocial and environmental areas, (iv) prepare required due diligence documents, and (iv) support \nearly procurement. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The PPTA will cover engineering, economic, financial, social and environmental aspects, \nas well as procurement preparation and support. Engineering will be carried out in sufficient \ndetail  to  carry  out  the  procurement  of  the  works.

ADB has recruited consultants under MYA: TA8788 to advise Department of Rural \nDevelopment (DRD) on a long-term sustainable approach to providing rural access.1 TA8788 \nconsultants and DRD will (i) define the CRRN, train local DRD staff in prioritizing projects for the \npilot  areas  (excluding  projects  with  significant  negative  environmental  impacts  and/or \nresettlement requirements) and facilitate consultations carried out by DRD, (ii) select design \nstandards, (iii) select trials and complementary measures to be piloted under the project, and (iv) \ndraft a national rural roads and access strategy. Results will be available before the PPTA \ncommences. \n \n4.  The UK Aid-funded Research for Community Access Program (ReCAP) is defining with \nDRD a program of assistance. DRD\u2019s priority is to a review and upgrading of existing standards \nleading to a Low Volume Rural Road Design Manual, which is likely to include some trials work. \nADB  is  in  discussions  with  ReCAP  and  DRD  to  enter  into  an  agreement  on  cooperation \nwhereby  ReCAP  will  support  DRD  in  preparation  and  implementation  support  for  these \nmeasures, which will be integrated by the PPTA consultant into the project to be financed under \nthe ADB loan.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n5.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,030,000 equivalent, of which $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The government \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, provision of furnished office \naccommodation,  communications  (local  calls  and  internet  connection),  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.
