INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested policy and advisory \ntechnical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Municipality-Level \nPublic\u2013Private Partnership Operational Framework for Chongqing. Following a mission in April \n2015,  ADB  and  the  government  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation  arrangement,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The economy of the PRC has undergone fundamental change as it transforms from a \nreliance  on  state-owned  and  collective  enterprises  to  a  mixed  economy  where  private \nenterprises play an increasing role. The private sector now plays a pivotal role in spurring \ninnovation  and  raising  productivity  and  competitiveness.  Private  sector  development  has \nnonetheless been constrained. For example, it has generally been difficult for the private sector \nto  engage  in  infrastructure,  given  the  extensive  presence  of  state-owned  enterprises.  The \ndelivery of social services, such as education and health, also remains dominated by the state. \n \n3.  New opportunities for the private sector emerged following the Third Plenary Session of \nthe 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held in November 2013. This set \nout the next phase of reform in the PRC in what is known as the Decisions.2 The decisions aim \nto further restructure the economy and foster inclusive growth by allowing the market to play a \ndecisive role in the PRC\u2019s development. Among other initiatives, the decisions committed to \nallow the social capital sector, which comprises the private sector and state-owned enterprises, \nto  participate  in  urban  infrastructure  investment  and  operation  through  concessions. \nConcessions are to be a vehicle for broadening urbanization financing channels, accelerating \nthe transformation of government functions, and improving fiscal investment and management. \n \n4.  Wide-ranging  policy  announcements  and  regulatory  releases  from  the  central \ngovernment subsequently set out a new operational framework for public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs).3 Many  international  practices  have  been  introduced  which  will  improve  on  past \npractices for preparing and implementing PPP projects. PPPs can now be used across urban \neconomic and social infrastructure. The central government initiatives have been mirrored by \nlocal governments, including through the establishment of demonstration projects and PPP \ncenters  (e.g.,  in  Chongqing  Municipality  and  Fujian,  Hebei,  Henan,  Hunan,  Jiangsu,  and \nSichuan provinces). In May 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission released \na project library containing 1,043 local government PPP projects, with a total investment of \nCNY1.97 trillion.4 \n \n5.  While  substantial  progress  has  been  made  in  strengthening  the  PRC\u2019s  operational \nframework for PPPs, follow-up action is needed. Much more work is required to broaden the \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 July 2015. \n2  Government of the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China, Chinese Communist Party Central Committee. 2013.

Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020. Manila. ADB presents a PPP operational \nframework  as  comprising  four  pillars:  pillar  1:  advocacy  and  capacity  development;  pillar  2:  the  enabling \nenvironment; pillar 3: project development; and pillar 4: project financing. Under ADB\u2019s PPP operational framework, \nconcessions are one type of PPP. \n4  National Development and Reform Commission.

The application of good practices, \nsuch as the selection of partner entities that are independent of the government and through a \ncompetitive  process  after  a  project  has  been  fully  prepared,  should  become  routine.  This \nrequires  continued  efforts  to  build  the  skills,  experience,  and  tools  required  for  effective \nimplementation. Legal and institutional reforms need to be deepened. \n \n6.  Much  of  the  responsibility  for  ensuring  a  successful  PPP  program  rests  with  local \ngovernments, which deliver about 85% of public expenditure in the PRC.5 The PRC\u2019s local \ngovernments must rapidly build their ability to use PPPs well if the increase in PPP activity now \nunder way is to succeed. For most of the PRC\u2019s local governments, PPPs are still a new \nmanagement tool, and the development of institutional and staff capacity is in its formative \nstages. It is particularly important that local governments now complete high-quality PPPs.6 In \naddition to improving public services, the completion of projects that are prepared well and \nprovide value for money will provide a tool for (i) building the understanding and capacity for \nPPPs,  (ii)  strengthening  the  enabling  environment,  and  (iii)  refining  approaches  to  project \npreparation  and  financing.  The  PPP  centers  being  established  provide  a  platform  for \nstrengthening the operational framework for PPPs at the local government level. \n \n7.  ADB  is  a  long-standing  partner  in the  PRC\u2019s PPPs.  Under  the  country  partnership \nstrategy  for  the  PRC,  ADB\u2019s  public  sector  operations  aim  to  strengthen  the  enabling \nenvironment for private sector development by financing infrastructure, supporting policy and \nregulatory reforms, and improving access to finance. Urban development is identified as a \npriority area for support for private sector participation and PPPs. The focus is on meeting the \ndemands arising from urbanization in the cities of the less-developed central, western, and \nnortheastern regions. The country partnership strategy also provides for complementary support \nfor knowledge sharing to promote best practices.7 \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s recent assistance for PPPs in the PRC has focused on providing a firm basis for \nPPPs by supporting advocacy and capacity development (pillar 1 of ADB\u2019s PPP operational \nplan). Significant progress has been made with more than 2,000 participants joining ADB-\nsupported PPP events since 2013, and the government is now independently implementing a \nlarge number of pillar 1 initiatives. ADB is also helping strengthen the enabling environment \n(pillar 2 of ADB\u2019s PPP operational plan), notably by supporting preparation of a national PPP \nlaw, the strengthening of the China Public\u2013Private Partnership Center, and the updating of \nsample PPP agreements.8 The significant progress combined with the strong pick up in PPP \nactivity has led to demand for ADB support to transition to project development and project \nfinancing\u2014pillars 3 (project development) and 4 (project financing) of ADB\u2019s PPP operational \nplan.  Discussion  is  ongoing  with  executing  and  implementing  agencies  of  ADB-supported \nprojects with potential to encompass PPPs, and TA is under way to explore the potential for \nviability gap funds and other schemes of providing government financial support to PPPs that \nwarrant it.9 \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2014.

THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  will  be  increased  private  sector  participation  and  operations  in  urban \ninfrastructure investment. The proposed TA is aligned with the decision of the Third Plenary \nSession of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to increase private \nsector participation in urban infrastructure investment and operations. The outcome will be an \nimproved  operational  framework  for  PPPs  in  Chongqing  Municipality,  with  performance \nassessed by the completion by 2017 of at least one PPP agreement for urban economic or \nsocial infrastructure that passes a value-for-money test and fiscal affordability assessment.10 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will strengthen the operational framework for PPPs in Chongqing Municipality. \nChongqing  in  central  PRC  is  one  of  the  country\u2019s  four  largest  municipalities  and  is  well \nadvanced in achieving a market-oriented economy.11 It is both ready for an expanded PPP \nprogram and can provide a rapid demonstration of good PPP practices at the local government \nlevel in ADB\u2019s regions of focus\u2014the less-developed central, western, and northeastern regions. \nThe TA will help officials prepare a strategic plan and work plan for Chongqing\u2019s PPP center.12 \nThe plans will provide a coherent set of sequenced and resourced actions that will deepen the \nreform  of the  local  PPP  program.  Good-practice  project  preparation procedures  and  other \nmanagement tools needed by a PPP center will be put in place. These tools will include a \nproject development facility.  \n11.  Output  1:  Public\u2013private  partnership  center  strengthened.  Chongqing  has \nestablished a multiagency coordination arrangement as the starting point of a PPP center. \nDrawing  on  a  mapping  of  the  roles  and  responsibilities  for  PPPs  of  different  levels  of \ngovernment, government agencies, and sections within agencies, the TA will help officials and \nstakeholders identify the best location, functions, and structure of the PPP center in Chongqing. \nA multiyear strategic plan and annual work plan will be prepared. The strategic plan and work \nplans for the PPP center will provide (i) a definition of the goals, roles, and responsibilities of the \ncenter; (ii) an organizational chart; (iii) work schedules with targets, activities, and required \nresources; (iii) job descriptions and employment arrangements; and (iv) auditing, reporting, and \nperformance assessment requirements. Initial versions of the strategic plan and annual work \nplans will be prepared early in TA implementation and renewed during TA implementation as \nrequired. \n \n12.  The preparation of the strategic plans and work plans will draw on recent advise from \nInfrastructure UK on the development of PPP centers in the PRC. The TA will help officials and \nstakeholders examine the location, powers, and responsibilities of PPP centers, taking into \naccount the benefits, costs, and feasibility of sharing functions across multiple PPP centers or \nconsolidating functions in  one  center. The  role  of  a  PPP  center  in  capacity  development, \nstrengthening the enabling environment, project development, providing government financial \nsupport, and supervising operations will be explored, along with linkages of the unit\u2019s activities \n                                                \n10  A sound operational framework for PPPs will deliver value-for-money public investment that is fiscally affordable, \nand its performance can be assessed by the number or value of PPPs completed with these characteristics. \n11  The Government of the PRC has five levels: central, provincial (comprising 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, \nand 4 special municipalities), prefecture, county, and township. Chongqing Municipality is one of the four special \nmunicipalities and includes four county-level cities. \n12  The term \u201dcenter\u201d is used in a broad sense and may include a unit, center, office, or a coordination arrangement.  \n ", "4  \nto planning, approval, and budget systems. Ways of ensuring the effective participation of \nstakeholders from within and outside government will be considered. Close attention will be paid \nto whether the PPP center has the financial resources and career structure needed to recruit \nand retain experts as permanent staff, and the adequacy of project databases, information \ntechnology, and portals required to support communication, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Tools  for  the  preparation  and  management  of  public\u2013private \npartnerships improved. The TA will support (i) improvements to how projects are identified \nand how their readiness is assessed by officials; (ii) the development of guidance on the \nleadership and composition of project teams; (iii) preparation of a detailed project cycle, and the \nchecklists  and  forms  required  to  standardize  its  application;  and  (iv)  the  elaboration,  as \nnecessary,  of  guidance  for  local  officials  on  key  issues  facing  PPPs,  such  as  (a)  the \nprocurement of PPP projects, (b) risk allocations, (c) the conduct of value-for-money and fiscal \nrisk assessments, (d) the incorporation of environmental and social safeguards in PPPs, and (e) \nensuring that projects are gender responsive. The TA will help develop a template for an annual \ndeclaration of the fiscal risks arising from PPPs and assist in an initial release through the \nbudget  process.  It  will  also  examine  the  principles  of  and  mechanisms  for  government \nprocurement of services delivered by PPP projects and the government contribution of land \nresources to PPP projects. \n \n14.  Output 2 will include the design of a project development facility. This facility will be \nsuitable for operation by the PPP center to fund external advisors and studies. The design will \naddress the objective of the facility and the activities it will support, contractual arrangements \nand the flow of funds, eligibility criteria, application and processing procedures, and auditing and \nevaluation systems. An accompanying staff manual will be prepared and any required legislative \namendments will be identified. The project development facility is expected to operate on a \nrevolving basis, i.e., the cost of developing (post-screening) successful PPPs will be recovered \nfrom  the  concessionaire.  Key  issues  expected  to  be  addressed  include  the  allocation  of \ndecision-making responsibilities, the prioritization of funds, the level of funds needed, and the \nchecks and balances required to ensure financial sustainability and transparency. \n  \n15.  Output 3: Understanding for public\u2013private partnerships among decision makers, \ngovernment  officials,  and  stakeholders  enhanced.  Awareness-raising  events  will  be \nsupported and widely accessible knowledge products (e.g., reports, working papers, guidance \nnotes) will be published in Chinese. The events and knowledge products will draw on other \noutputs of the TA with the aim of encouraging informed inputs from stakeholders, fostering \nsupport for implementation, and disseminating key findings. Other provinces will be invited to \nattend events on an observer basis (and at their own cost).  \n \n16.  The  design  and  implementation  of  key  initiatives  will  be  led  by  officials,  with  TA \nconsultants playing an active supporting role. In this way the TA will provide an important \nlearning-by-doing exercise that will build the internal capacity to continue strengthening the \noperational  framework  and  sustaining  the  TA  results.  Accordingly,  the  TA  will  employ  a \nparticipatory approach to the preparation of outputs, such as through support for focus group \ndiscussion and workshops among officials and stakeholders. The work of the TA will draw on \nsuccessful  examples  from  other  countries  and  the  lessons  from  ADB  support  for  PPP \nstrengthening programs (including in Indonesia, India, Pakistan, and the Philippines). Maximum \nuse will be made of assistance from ADB and other development partners so as to add value to \nearlier work and to avoid duplication. \n \n   \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Public\u2013Private  Infrastructure  Advisory  Facility  and  administered  by  ADB. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff and \nother services to the consultants, assistance in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies, \nand other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 15 August 2015 to 15 August 2017. \nThe  Chongqing  Finance  Bureau  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing  agency.  An \ninternational PPP advisor will provide a total input of 2 person-months. National consultants, \nincluding a team leader, PPP specialist, institutional specialist, legal specialist, and coordinator, \nwill provide total input of 14 person-months. As a single firm is likely to find it difficult to provide \nthe  diversity  of  skills  and  experience  required,  and  timeliness  in  recruitment  is  important, \nconsultants will be recruited individually. As TA implementation will make extensive use of \nparticipatory workshops, and as a wide range of skills and experience will be required to support \nthese workshops, a substantial provision is made for resource persons. The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3.13 \n \n19.  The TA will be undertaken with the active participation of all relevant departments and \nagencies of participating governments. The TA will also be implemented in close coordination \nwith related ADB-supported projects and other development partners supporting PPPs in the \nPRC. Outreach activities will help ensure understanding and engagement of these partners. \n \n20.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget allocation. To support \nmonitoring and evaluation, the consultant team will submit an inception report, a midterm report, \na draft final report, and a final report to the government and ADB. The main mechanism to \nmonitor progress, assess performance, and ensure relevance will be TA review missions. \n \n21.  The key risks are that (i) government support for the delivery of public services through \nPPPs weakens, (ii) the private sector and potential financiers are deterred from PPPs by poor \nproject design, (iii) support for institutional reforms cannot be secured, (iv) PPP units cannot \nobtain or retain sufficient human resources to be effective, (v) participating governments lack \nthe budget to consider providing financial support for PPPs, (vi) weak public sector capacity \ndelays TA implementation, and (vii) suitable consultants cannot be identified in a timely manner. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China to  be financed  on  a grant  basis by  the  Public\u2013Private \nInfrastructure Advisory Facility for the Municipality-Level Public\u2013Private Partnership Operational \nFramework for Chongqing, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n13 ADB will engage consultants as well as resource persons in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nthe Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants and \nresource persons will be engaged on a fixed-price and/or lump-sum basis wherever feasible. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the project is aligned with: \nPrivate sector participation in urban infrastructure investment and operations increased.
