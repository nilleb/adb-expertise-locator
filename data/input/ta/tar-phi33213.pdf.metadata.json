INTRODUCTION\n1. Water services are increasingly being privatized in many countries; the Philippines is no\nexception. The operations of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) were\nprivatized in August 1997 through the award of two 25-year concession contracts.1 Many other\nlocal water utilities in the country are considering similar options. With this development, the\nGovernment of the  Philippines has become aware of the urgent need to establish regulatory\nmechanisms and strengthen capabilities of various water utilities to handle regulatory work.\nGiven  the  regulatory  work  already  under  way  for  the  privatized  MWSS  operations,  the\nGovernment requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance\n(TA) for capacity building support for regulatory work with particular attention to the Regulatory\nOffice  of  MWSS  (MWSS-RO).  A  fact-finding  mission  fielded  in  September  2000  reached\nagreement with the Government on the objectives, scope, costs, financing, and implementation\narrangements for the TA. The TA was included in the 2000 Philippines country assistance plan2\nand subsequently, confirmed for the 2001 pipeline in May 2001. The TA framework is attached\nas Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. At  present,  the  Philippines  has  no  autonomous  national  water  regulatory  body  to\nmanage  water  resources  and  allocate  them  among  various  uses  like  power  generation,\nirrigation,  and  water  supply.3  Establishment  of  a  water  regulatory  commission  is  under\nconsideration.4 The Government participated in ADB\u2019s regional TA5 for water regulatory bodies.\nThe TA established a forum of 10 ADB developing member countries6  to share lessons learned\nand good practices relating to broad water regulatory functions. The TA analyzed various\nprivatization cases including MWSS, discussed these cases with the participating governments\nand water utilities, and provided benchmarks for comparing policies, approaches, and decisions\nof regulatory water bodies throughout the region.\n3. The  MWSS  privatization  is  the  first  major  privatization  of  a  water  utility  in  the\nPhilippines;  MWSS\u2019s  regulatory  duties  will  be  a  subset  of  the  national  water  regulatory\nfunctions.  Similar  privatization  of  water  services  has  also  been  in  process  or  under\nconsideration in several other smaller water utilities under local government units, and a trend to\nprivate sector options is clearly discernible. Accordingly, good practices must be established for\nspecific regulatory work applicable to privatized water services. The function-specific regulatory\nwork will complement the overall national regulatory framework. With the need for assistance on\nregulatory work already existing, MWSS is the primary beneficiary of the TA. However, the TA\nhas a larger purpose of benefiting all concerned water utilities. Consequently, the TA outputs\nwill be of generic value without requiring specific reference to confidential matters of the MWSS\nconcession agreements. Also, to ensure the TA outputs are acceptable to all sides, the TA will\n                  \n1  The two concessionaires are Manila Water Company, Inc. covering the East Concession area, and Maynilad\nWater Services, Inc. covering the West Concession area. The concessionaires have been engaged separately,\nbut the terms and conditions of the concession agreements are identical.\n2   The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in February 2000.\n3  The National Water Rescues Board performs only limited functions in this regard, mainly the issuance of water\npermits for the use of surface and groundwater.\n4  The matter was examined in an initiative: Water and Sewerage Legislation in the Philippines financed by the\nPublic-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, for $220,000, commenced in December 1999 and was completed in\nNovember 2000.\n5  TA-5922-REG: Regulatory Systems and Networking of Water Utilities and Regulatory Bodies, for $550,000,\napproved on 19 July 2000.\n6  Bangladesh, the People\u2019s Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand,\nand Viet Nam.", "2\nbe implemented with inputs not only from the water utilities but also water services operators\n(concessionaires), the party subject to regulation.\n4. The TA will examine various options for regulatory work relating to specific functional\nareas, review its processes conceptually, functionally, and methodologically. The TA also aims\nto strengthen institutional capabilities through skills upgrading, so that beneficiary water utilities\ncan  perform  their  tasks  smoothly  and  efficiently.  While  MWSS-RO  will  be  the  primary\nbeneficiary,  the  TA  is  aimed  at  helping  any  water  utility  that  has  or  will  have  regulatory\nresponsibilities.  The  TA  will  also  complement  the  regional  TA,    which  supports  the\nestablishment of an independent national water regulatory body, by providing a common base\nfor specific regulatory work to various water utilities nationwide.\n5. MWSS-RO was established under the MWSS Charter and is mandated to regulate\nwater services under the framework of the concession agreements. MWSS-RO is independent\nfrom MWSS, which is responsible for operations; however, both are governed by the MWSS\nBoard of Trustees. The powers, duties, and responsibilities of MWSS-RO are set out in the\nconcession agreements. MWSS-RO\u2019s major functions include (i) monitoring and adjustment of\nwater rates, (ii) monitoring and regulation of service operations,  (iii) monitoring and regulation\nof service infrastructure conditions, and (iv) handling customer complaints. MWSS-RO has\ndeveloped its own work processes to handle these tasks but is facing difficulties in undertaking\nits tasks smoothly and efficiently.\n6. Experience  has  shown  that  MWSS-RO\u2019s  own  work  processes  need  to  have  better\ntechnical soundness and compatibility with international standards. Also, in many aspects, the\nconcession agreements have only general stipulations. These need to be specified in detail, so\nthat the stipulations may be enforced in a fair and transparent manner. MWSS-RO needs expert\nadvice and assistance for this, particularly during the early years of the concession period.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n7. The  long-term  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  help  establish  independent  water  regulatory\nmechanisms. The immediate objectives of the TA are to strengthen MWSS-RO\u2019s capabilities to\nefficiently execute the concession agreements, and to identify, for other water utilities and their\noperators, good practices for regulatory work in specific functional areas.\nB.  Scope\n8. The  TA  will  help  identify  fair  and  transparent  regulatory  mechanisms  in  financial\nregulation, technical regulation, and legal affairs.  Using the MWSS concession agreements as\na  base,  the  TA  will  focus  on  specific  regulatory  work  that  needs  verification  or  further\nexamination of approaches and methodologies.7 The TA outputs will be in generic terms and not\nbe specifically related to the concession agreements. In the area of financial regulation, the TA\nwill focus on price adjustments and penalty assessment resulting from nonperformance.  The\nfollowing  activities  will  be  covered:  economic  regulation,  particularly  the  determination  of\ndiscount  rates  and  net  present  value  to  be  used  in  computation,  benchmarking,  financial\nanalysis (financial ratios and comparative analyses), and financial modeling. Assistance for the\nareas of technical regulation will focus on the measurement of service performance and the\n                  \n7  The TA will not address performance requirements that are sufficiently specific in the concession agreements,\nsuch as number of service connections and hours of supply.", "3\nformulation of remedial actions. The following aspects, among others, will be examined: asset\nvaluation,  water  quality  standard  and  assurance  measures,  and  nonrevenue  water\nmeasurement. The legal affairs will cover common legal issues found in regulatory work.\n9. The  TA  couples  process  improvements  with  human  development  to  generate\ncompound benefits. Lessons learned from past capacity building efforts will be incorporated. A\nthorough  background  research  and  diagnostic  study  will  be  carried  out.  Various  legal\nframeworks,  including  MWSS-RO\u2019s,  will  be  examined  and  best  practices  to  satisfy  typical\nregulatory  obligations  identified.  Objective  performance  indicators,  including  environmental\nperformance, will be developed. An operational monitoring program will also be developed.\nRegulatory work under other similar utility services will be studied to identify sound principles,\nmethodologies,  procedures,  and  practices.  Regulatory  requirements  may  be  interrelated  to\nthose of other government agencies responsible for,  among others, auditing, public health,  and\neconomic indicators. Research will be undertaken to assess and verify such interlinkages.\nGuidelines, handbooks, and reference materials will be prepared with particular attention to\nclarity, practical application, and ease of use. These will be computerized to the extent suitable\nfor MWSS-RO and other potential users. The results of research will be sorted and established\nas reference databases to facilitate correct use of the work processes developed.\n10. Skills requirements for the recommended work processes will be assessed to set the\nparameters  for  training.  Human  development  will  be  through  a  series  of  workshops  and\nseminars,  with  emphasis  on  case  studies  within  and  outside  the  Philippines.  Broad\nparticipation will be emphasized to ensure that recommended work processes are operative\nunder local conditions. Participants will be invited from various stakeholder groups to optimize\nthe TA outputs and benefits. They will include personnel not only from MWSS-RO and the\nMWSS concessionaires, but also from other water utilities, such as the Local Water Utilities\nAdministration and the water districts in various local government units, and their operators in\nboth public and private sectors. Separate workshops and seminars will be held to address\ntechnical and managerial aspects. The latter will cover, among others, matters relating to water\nresources  management  and  regulation  at  the  national  level,  and  be  targeted  at  senior\nmanagement  participants,  including  the  management  of  MWSS,  the  concessionaires,  and\nmembers  of  the  MWSS  Board  of  Trustees.  To  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  training\nprovided,  needs  will  be  identified  at  the  outset,  specific  targets  set,  and  the  level  of\nunderstanding checked at the conclusion of the program. As a complementary effort, MWSS-\nRO and other participating water utilities and operators will prepare general human resource\ndevelopment plans, including an assessment of formal training needs. Training for trainers will\nbe provided to maximize the dissemination of benefits from institutional strengthening. To  make\nskills development, upgrading opportunities, and refresher courses available on a    regular\nbasis, modular in-house training programs, including computer-based interactive tutorials for\nself-help learning, will be developed. Staff responsible for legal affairs need to be familiar with\nthe  financial  and  technical  operations  and  hence,  will  participate  in  the  training  for  these\nsubjects.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $600,000 equivalent the local currency cost (Appendix 2). ADB will provide\n$800,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $200,000  of  the  local\ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Asian Currency Crisis\nSupport Facility, funded by the Government of Japan. MWSS-RO will finance the remaining\nlocal currency costs of $400,000 equivalent to cover part of the workshop and report  production", "4\ncosts, as well as office space, secretarial and administrative support and facilities, and other\nmiscellaneous expenses.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n12. MWSS-RO will be the Executing Agency. The chief regulator will be responsible for TA\nimplementation and will lead a task team to be formed for this purpose. The team will have\nthree main working groups, representing financial regulation, technical regulation,8 and legal\naffairs. Each working group is headed by the manager of the concerned regulation area. The\nworking group for technical regulation will include staff from the customer service regulation\narea who will work as team members. The working group for legal affairs will join the other two\ngroups as necessary. Regulators for concerned regulation areas will coordinate with the chief\nregulator as necessary. These working groups will collaborate with their counterparts in the\nconcessionaires to implement the TA. MWSS-RO will provide secretarial and administrative\nsupport, fully equipped office space, and other facilities necessary for the TA.\n13. The  TA  inputs  will  be  provided  by  a  team  of  three  international  consultants  (15.5\nperson-months) and five domestic consultants (26 person-months). The consultants will have\nexpertise and experience in the implementation of regulatory work in privatized water services\non  a  concession  basis,  and  specific  expertise  in  economic,  financial,  technical,  and  legal\naspects of regulatory work. In the financial regulation area, the consultants will have principal\nexpertise  in  economic  regulation,  investment  appraisal,  and  regulatory  accounting.  In  the\ntechnical  regulation  area,  the  consultants  will  principally  have  expertise  in  water  and\nwastewater treatment, and water supply systems. In the legal affairs area, the consultants will\nbe  familiar  with  legal  matters  in  the  context  of  regulatory  work  under  similar  concession\narrangements  involving  international  parties,  with  particular  emphasis  on  settlement  of\ndisputes. The consultants will work closely with MWSS-RO and the concessionaires, among\nothers, and have keen awareness of local conditions and practices, in addition to the  necessary\nbasic  expertise  and  quality  in  coaching.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting\nservices (Appendix 3) were developed in consultation with MWSS-RO and the concessionaires.\nThe consultants will be recruited as a firm and selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s simplified\ntechnical proposal procedures and the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n14. The TA will be implemented over 12 months to ensure that the recommended work\nprocesses are thoroughly examined and confirmed effective. The consultants are expected to\ncommence work on 1 November 2001, with completion scheduled for 31 October 2002. For\neach of the financial and technical regulation areas, a team consisting of one international\nconsultant  (technical  and  capacity  building  expert)  and  one  domestic  consultant  (technical\nspecialist) will work on the technical aspects of work process and documentation thereof within\nthe first six months. Thereafter, a domestic consultant (capacity building expert in respective\nfields) will be responsible for the dissemination of the recommended work processes for six\nmonths.  The  international  consultants  will  return  for  two  weeks  at  the  end  of  the  TA\nimplementation period to ensure issues and problems identified during the dissemination stage\nare fully resolved and otherwise conclude all services. As for legal affairs, one international\nconsultant  and  one  domestic  consultant  (legal  capacity  building  experts)  will  work  for  two\nmonths to produce the envisaged outputs. The international consultant will also return for two\nweeks at the end of TA implementation to ensure sustainability of the facilities set up under the\nTA.\n                  \n8  Aspects of customer service regulation will be handled by this group.", "5\n15. The TA outputs include recommended work processes for specific aspects relating to\nregulatory  work  for  water  services.  The  consultants  will  produce  operational  guidelines,\nhandbooks, and reference materials for the areas of financial and technical regulation, and a\nreference library will be established for the legal affairs area. The outputs also include at least\n24  workshops  and  seminars,  as  well  as  skills  development  programs  and  related  training\nmaterials, all aimed at the regulating parties and those subject to regulation. All work will be of\ngeneric nature and not be specifically related to the concession agreements. TA progress will\nbe monitored through tripartite meetings at various milestones, including inception, end of the\nwork process establishment stage, commencement of the human development stage, during\nmid-course inputs by the international consultants, and TA completion. The consultants will\nproduce a report at each of these stages,  in addition to the standard quarterly progress\nreports.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n16. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of the\nPhilippines in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 for the purpose of Capacity\nBuilding for the Regulatory Office of the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nMonitoring Assumptions and\nDesign Summary Performance Targets\nMechanisms Risks\nGoal\n-  Facilitate the -  Technical -  Periodic reports by -  Government remains\nestablishment of assistance (TA) Metropolitan firm on establishment\nindependent water outputs adopted by Waterworks and of WRC.\nregulatory the planned national Sewerage System -  Necessary legislation\nmechanisms. water regulatory Regulatory Office passed without delay.\nbody.

General\n1. The technical assistance (TA) will use three international consultants for 15.5 person-\nmonths, and five domestic consultants for 26 person-months: (i) one international consultant\n(technical and capacity building/team leader: 6.5 person-months) and two domestic consultants\n(technical:  6  person-months,  and  human  development:  6  person-months)  for  the  financial\nregulation area; (ii) one international consultant (technical and capacity building: 6.5 person-\nmonths) and two domestic consultants (technical: 6 person-months, and human development: 6\nperson-months) for the technical regulation area (which also covers customer service regulation\narea); and (iii) one international consultant (technical and capacity building: 2.5 person-months)\nand one domestic consultant (technical: 2 person-months) for legal affairs. The consultants will\nclosely  examine  the  findings  of  the  following  studies  and  reflect  them  in  assisting  the\nGovernment in the eventual establishment of a water regulatory commission: (i) regional TA for\nregulatory systems and networking of water utilities and regulatory bodies; and (ii) a Public-\nPrivate Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) initiative for water and sewerage legislation in\nthe Philippines.\n2. The consulting services will be provided over 12 months. For the financial and technical\nregulation  areas,  they  are  provided  in  two  stages.  The  first  six  months  will  be  for  the\nidentification of fair and transparent mechanisms for regulatory work on specific function areas,\nand related documentation, to be undertaken by a team consisting of one international and one\ndomestic  consultant  on  a  full-time  basis.  The  remaining  six  months  will  be  for  human\ndevelopment using the recommended practices developed, to be undertaken by one domestic\nconsultant on a full-time basis. The international consultant will provide wrap-up sessions during\nthe final two weeks of TA implementation. For legal affairs, a team of one international and one\ndomestic  consultant  will  work  full  time  for  two  months  to  develop  a  reference  library  and\ndatabases. The international consultant will also return for two weeks to wrap up the TA.\n3. Major  expertise  required  includes  the  following:  (i)  economic  regulation,  investment\nappraisal,  and  regulatory  accounting  (financial  regulation  area);  (ii)  water  and  wastewater\ntreatment, and water supply systems (technical regulation area); and (iii) legal matters (legal\naffairs). The consultants will have ample practical experience in (i) regulatory work in water\nservices  and  similar  utilities  operated  through  concession  arrangements,  and  (ii)  human\ndevelopment in institutional capacity building.\nB.  Approach\n4. The  TA  outputs  are  for  general  use  and  not  specific  to  the  MWSS  concession\nagreements. Thus, the consultants\u2019 work will also be of generic value. To ensure the TA outputs\nare balanced and acceptable to not only water utilities but also water services operators, the\nparty subject to regulation, the consultants will collect views, expertise, and experience from the\nwidest possible base and consequently, will collaborate with both Metropolitan Waterworks and\nSewerage System Regulatory Office (MWSS-RO) and the concessionaires on an equal basis.\nOther water utilities, such as the Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) and the water\ndistricts in local government units (LGUs) and their operators will be consulted.\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 13)", "9\nAppendix 3, Page 2\n5. Identification of fair and transparent mechanisms for specific regulatory work\ninvolves  the  following  steps:  (i)  study  of  various  broad,  independent  water  regulation\nframeworks, and identification of a common setup; (ii) research of specific regulatory work\nrequirements under various operational arrangements; (iii) examination of various principles,\nmethodologies,  procedures,  and  practices,  and  identification  of  best  practices;  (iv)\ndocumentation of the findings into practical guidelines, handbooks, and reference materials of\ngeneric nature; and (v) compilation of the information obtained in steps (i)-(iv) into reference\nlibraries and databases. The first-stage research is on independent water regulation at the\nnational level and will be based on, among others, the findings of the regional TA and the\nPPIAF studies. The findings at this stage will lay the foundation for the review of specific\nregulatory work processes under various operation arrangements. The examination at this\nstage will include thorough studies of cases both within and outside the Philippines. During\ndocumentation, particular attention will be paid to clarity, practicality, and ease of use and\nmaintenance  (updating).  Documents  will  be  prepared  also  in  soft  copies  to  facilitate\ndevelopment of on-line training materials later on.\n6. Human  development  involves  the  following  steps:  (i)  identification  of  skills\nrequirements; (ii) assessment of participants\u2019 general skills levels; (ii) development of skills\ndevelopment targets; (iii) dissemination of knowledge through workshops and seminars; (iv)\nmeasurement of achievement through case studies and simulations; and (iv) wrapping up.\nParameters for the workshops and seminars will be determined based on the participants\u2019 skills\nlevels. Performance indicators will be developed to monitor the achievements. Workshops and\nseminars will be held separately for the technical/operational aspects and managerial aspects.\nThose for managerial aspects will focus on issues of broader water policy and regulation at the\nnational level. Workshops and seminars will adopt a participatory approach to ensure their\nrelevance. Progress will be thoroughly checked mid-course and changes made in workshops\nand  seminar  contents  as  necessary.  Trainer-training  will  be  conducted  and  self-learning\nprograms developed to ensure human development translates into institutional strengthening.\nThe legal aspects are examined in relation to the financial and technical areas. Accordingly,\nhuman development relating to the legal affairs will be handled under the other two areas.\nC.  Financial Regulation Area\n7. The work focuses on price adjustments and performance penalty adjustments. Price\nadjustments  will  address  common  causes  including  inflation,  currency  fluctuations,  and\nunforeseen  events.  The  consultants  will  examine  technical  soundness,  fairness,  and\ntransparency. The work requires examination of concepts, approaches, methodologies,  and\npractices of, among others, the following activities: (i) economic regulation (particularly on\ndetermination of discount rates and net present value [NPV]); (ii) benchmarking; (iii) appraisal of\nincome and expenses; (iv) financial analysis, especially in the context of reviewing financial\nstatements, especially financial ratios and comparative analyses; and (v) financial modeling,\nincluding  determination  of  items  (expenses)  to  be  considered.  The  work  on  performance\npenalties will require inputs from the technical regulation area, and will focus on the conversion\nof service performance shortfalls to financial penalties. Generally acceptable ways to determine\nvarious factors to be used for the computation, such as consumer price indexes, currency\nexchange rates, and financial performance indicators, will be explored.", "10\nAppendix 3, page 3\nD.  Technical Regulation Area\n8. The  work  focuses  on  service  performance  measurement,  performance  penalty\nassessment, and remedial action formulation. The work will include examination of various\npractices for monitoring, valuation, and assessment of, among others, the following activities: (i)\nasset condition reporting; (ii) service performance relating to water supply, sewerage, and\nsanitation services; (iii) physical implementation; (iv) water and wastewater effluent quality; (v)\nwater pressure management; and (vi) nonrevenue water, especially metering. Implications of\nrelated standards that are commonly regulated outside water utilities, such as those related to\npublic health (water quality standards) and environment (wastewater effluent standards) will\nalso be examined. The work also covers the customer service regulation area where it is closely\nrelated  to  the  technical  regulation  area.  The  work  may  also  concern  broader  issues  of\nformulation  and  implementation  of  national  policies  for  water  management  and  sanitation.\nFindings of the regional TA and the PPIAF studies will be utilized in this regard.\nE.  Legal Affairs\n9. The work essentially concerns the establishment of a reference library for legal matters\nrelating to the execution of the concession agreements, with particular attention to arbitration\ninvolving international parties.
