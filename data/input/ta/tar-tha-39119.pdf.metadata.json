The Government of Thailand has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  strengthen  its  regime  for  anti-money  laundering  (AML)  and \ncombating the financing of terrorism (CFT). A wide spectrum for technical inputs and urgent \ncapacity building are needed to support the Government\u2019s efforts to enhance its current AML-\nCFT  regime.  A  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  need  for  such  assistance  in  Thailand  was \npresented at the 2004 Annual Meeting of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) \nand discussed by all development agencies concerned. Providing support for building a more \neffective AML-CFT regime is in line with ADB operations in Thailand, which emphasize good \ngovernance as one of the major pillars for assistance. The TA will be consistent with ADB policy \nto enhance ADB's role in combating money laundering and financing of terrorism.1 An ADB fact-\nfinding mission met with the Government\u2019s AML-CFT Working Committee2 and the officials of \nthe Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) on 14 March 2005 and reached an agreement on the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA. \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.   Adopting,  implementing,  and  enforcing  internationally  accepted  standards  against \nmoney laundering and the financing of terrorism, in particular the 40 recommendations and 9 \nspecial recommendations on terrorist financing of the Financial Actions Task Force on Money \nLaundering (FAFT), are on the agenda of governments around the world. Thailand is strongly \ncommitted to establishing an efficient and reliable AML regime. The Anti-Money Laundering \nAct, which establishes the legal framework for an AML regime in Thailand, became effective \non 20 August 1999. In accordance with the act, an AML board was established to undertake \nthe functions of a financial intelligence unit. The board  comprises the heads of relevant \nGovernment ministries and agencies, and is chaired by the Prime Minister and cochaired by \nthe minister of finance. The act establishes necessary basic legal and institutional frameworks \nfor an AML regime. Thailand is a founding member of the APG. \n \n3.  AMLO, set up in the Office of the Prime Minister, and in place since October 2002 \nunder the supervision of the minister of justice, is mandated to (i) act in accordance with the \nresolutions  of  the  AML  board  and  carry  out  other  administrative  functions;  (ii)  receive \ntransaction reports, to be delivered in accordance with the requirements of the act; (iii) collect, \ntrace,  monitor,  study,  and  analyze  reports  or  any  other  information  related  to  financial \ntransactions; (iv) collect evidence in order to prosecute any violator under the provisions of the \nact; (v) launch an education program to disseminate information, educate, and provide training \npertaining to undertakings of the act; and (vi) carry out other functions in accordance with the \nprovisions of the act and other laws. \n   \n4.  Although AMLO has achieved some significant tangible results in confiscating criminal \nproceeds,  gaps  still  remain  for  Thailand  to  fully  comply  with  international  conventions, \nincluding the FATF 40 plus 9 recommendations. Several studies assessing the requirements \nfor Thailand to build a more effective AML-CFT regime in line with international standards \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n2 The AML/CFT Working Committee comprise representatives from the Bank of Thailand, Ministry of Finance, \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the respective business associations for \nfinancial institutions.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 April 2005.  \n ", "2   \nhave been conducted, including an International Monetary Fund review mission that identified \nspecific TA needs in February 2004. An aid coordination meeting to share the findings of the \nreview mission was held on 11 and 12 May 2004. The requirements focused mainly on three \nareas: (i) revising the existing legal framework to bring it to full compliance with the FATF 40 \nplus 9 recommendations and other international conventions on AML-CFT; (ii) establishing a \nsystem of compliance for financial institutions in coordination with the respective supervisory \nagencies, such as the Bank of Thailand for banks, the Securities Exchange Commission for \nsecurities  brokers  and  investment  trusts,  and  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  for  insurance \ncompanies; and (iii) building awareness of financial institutions, government officials, and the \npublic in general. \n \n5.  In  addition  to  the  needs  identified,  assistance  is  needed  to  intensify  efforts  for \ninternational cooperation, which constitutes 5 of the FATF recommendations. Given the nature \nof  money  laundering  and  financing  of  terrorism,  solid  international  cooperation  is  key  to \neffective implementation of AML-CFT. The recommendations call for mutual legal assistance \nto the greatest extent possible and an established system for expeditious actions to be taken \nin response to requests made by foreign countries (FATF recommendations 37 and 38). The \npromotion  of  regional  and  international  cooperation  will  have  definite  benefits.  Technical \nexpertise, latest cases of AML-CFT, and other relevant information may be obtained from the \nmore developed countries. Regionally, Thailand is in a position to share its experiences in \nestablishing the legal and institutional frameworks for AML-CFT with neighboring Mekong \ncountries that are just now initiating the process.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The objective of the TA is to assist the Government in its efforts to build a more efficient \nand effective AML-CFT regime. The TA will help Thailand achieve a higher level of compliance \nin  the  area  of  international  cooperation  within  the  framework  of  established  international \nstandards. The TA has two components. \n \n7.  Component A. The first component will assist the Government in (i) reassessing the \nlegal,  institutional,  and  procedural  requirements  for  conforming  to  the  FATF  40  plus  9 \nrecommendations on international cooperation; and (ii) formulating an action plan through \nconsultation  with  all  stakeholders,  including  all  government  agencies  concerned  and  the \nprivate  sector  (to  be  represented  by  the  respective  business  associations),  as  well  as \ninternational and regional organizations on AML-CFT.  \n \n7.  International consultants will be engaged to reassess the current AML-CFT regime in \nlight of its compliance with FATF recommendations on international cooperation and other \ninternational conventions. A sequenced draft action plan will be prepared for achieving a \nhigher level of compliance in the next 3 years. \n  \n8.  The draft action plan will be discussed with all key officials and stakeholders involved \nin implementing the action plan. A high-level workshop will be held to present the action plan \nfor open discussions with key government officials. After consolidating feedback given during \nand after the high-level workshop and an agreement on the action plan, the plan will be \npresented by the Government to private sector financial institutions (to be represented by the \nrespective business associations) for their comments and suggestions. The action plan will be \nfinalized for adoption by the Government.  \n ", "  3\n9.  The first component will also initiate the first phase of the adopted action plan, with \ntechnical inputs from international consultants. \n \n10.  Component B. The second component will support the Government in holding training \nsessions for officials in the Mekong region. The Thai Government, with AMLO as the focal \npoint,  will  organize  the  training  sessions  on  measures  for  establishing  the  legal  and \ninstitutional framework for an AML-CFT regime, including cross-border issues. ADB and the \ninternational  consultants  will  help  prepare  the  training  sessions  and  select  officials  from \nrelevant countries as appropriate.4 The sessions will also serve as a platform to present the \naction plan for international cooperation adopted by the Thai Government. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA aims to (i) build a consensus on a phased plan for conforming to the FATF 40 \nplus 9 recommendations on international cooperation by all relevant stakeholders, including the \ngovernment ministries and agencies concerned, and private sector financial institutions; and (ii) \nachieve completion of the first phase of such a plan. A consultative approach will be taken \nthroughout TA implementation to ensure that the 3-year action plan to achieve higher levels of \ncompliance  with  the  requirements  for  international  cooperation  in  AML-CFT  is  sequenced, \npractical, and has the support of all stakeholders in its implementation. The TA will also consult \nAsia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) as well as the Egmont Group of financial \nintelligence  units  to  ensure  that  the  measures  adopted  are  in  line  with  the  internationally \naccepted AML standards as set out in the FATF 40 plus 9 recommendations.  \n \n12.  Key activities will include consultative discussions with all stakeholders, a high-level \nworkshop with the officials of the Government ministries and agencies concerned in finalizing \nthe 3-year action program, and training sessions for establishing the AML-CFT regime for the \nMekong region. The deliverables will be publicly disseminated in consultation with AMLO, when \nassessed to be beneficial for promoting awareness of AML activities in Thailand. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $429,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost component of $215,000 and $214,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will \nprovide $300,000 equivalent covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $85,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for \nRegional Trade and Financial Security Initiative.5 ADB will administer the TA. The Government \nwill contribute $129,000 in kind for office space, counterpart staff, local transportation, and other \nservices and facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  AMLO will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The AML-CFT Working Committee will \nbe  the  Implementing  Agency  and  will  provide  necessary  office  space,  counterpart  staff, \ntransportation, and other support services to the consultants. AMLO will be responsible for \n                                                 \n4  Mekong region members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, as well as Cambodia and Lao PDR will be the \ntargeted countries. \n5  The Cooperation Fund for Regional Trade and Financial Security Initiative is a multi-donor umbrella facility that \nsupports ADB TA to developing member countries for enhancing port security and combating money laundering \nand terrorist financing. The governments of Australia, Japan, and the United States have contributed to this fund.  \n ", "4   \ncoordinating various institutions and agencies involved in formulating the 3-year action plan, \norganizing the training program for the region, and overseeing overall TA implementation. \n \n15.  ADB will engage international consultants in association with domestic consultants to \nprovide services for a total of 13 person-months: 7 person-months international and 6 person-\nmonths domestic.
