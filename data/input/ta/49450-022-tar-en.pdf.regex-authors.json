THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY\nA. Justification\n1. The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will conduct required due \ndiligence and provide project preparation and procurement support, capacity building, and policy \nrecommendations for seven ensuing energy sector projects for approval in 2019\u20132022 under the \nPacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility.1 The facility, approved in June 2017, is designed \nto finance a large number of small-value renewable energy projects in the 11 smaller Pacific island \ncountries (PIC-11).2 The facility supports the PIC-11 in transforming their power sectors from \ndiesel to sustainable renewable energy generation sources; and supports sector reform, private \nsector development, and capacity building.3 The proposed TA is included in the PIC-11 country \noperations business plan, 2019\u20132021.4\n2. The facility impact is improved energy security following the outcome of lower cost and \ncleaner electricity generation. The facility outputs are (i) renewable energy generation constructed \nand (ii) sector reform undertaken. The facility will finance renewable energy projects in the \nPIC-11 with an overall estimated cost of $750 million, comprising (i) up to $200 million in Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing, (ii) an estimated $500 million from cofinancing sources, and\n(iii) an estimated $50 million from government counterpart financing. ADB will consider projects\nto be financed by the facility up to July 2022, while the implementation period will be up to\nJuly 2025.5\n3. The facility will support an estimated 20 projects with the following cumulative performance\nindicators  by  2025:  (i)  80  megawatts  (MW)  of  renewable  energy  generation  capacity\ncommissioned, (ii) 30 megawatt-hours (MWh) of battery storage installed, and (iii) 300 kilometers\nof transmission and distribution network constructed. The facility implementation is generally on\ntrack and the details are in the 2018 facility\u2019s annual report.6\n4. Regional project preparatory TA for $5 million, $2 million of which is financed on a grant\nbasis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Fund (TASF-V) and $3 million from the Clean Energy\nFinancing Partnership Facility, was approved in November 2016 to help prepare projects to be\nfinanced under the facility.7 Increases in the TA amount totaling $3 million from the TASF and\n$500,000 from the High-Level Technology Fund were approved during 2017\u20132018.8 The TA is to\n1  ADB. 2017.

Manila.  \n2  The 11 countries are the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Nauru, Palau, the Marshall \nIslands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Smaller refers to population. \n3  The facility will benefit the PIC-11 economies through (i) an improved balance of trade by reducing fossil fuel imports, \n(ii)improved energy security, (iii) downward pressure on tariffs, and (iv) and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\n4  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: 11 Small Pacific Island Countries, 2019\u20132021. Manila.\n5  The facility provides an aggregate approval limit under which the President is authorized to approve loans and grants \nto a range of qualifying small-value renewable energy projects in the PIC-11 from 2017 to 2022. This innovative \nmodality streamlines ADB\u2019s procedures and reduces processing times and transaction costs.\n6  ADB. 2019.

", "2 \nprepare 12 energy projects, of which four were approved in 2017\u20132018 and eight are being\nprepared for approval in 2019 and 2020.9 All funds under the TA are fully committed. \n5. At least four projects per year are expected to be prepared under the facility. Therefore, a\nsecond transaction TA facility is needed to prepare the five identified projects from the 2020\u20132022\npipeline, including (i) the South Tarawa Renewable Energy Project in Kiribati, (ii) the Renewable \nEnergy Project in Palau, (iii) Phase 2 of the Majuro Power Network Strengthening Project in the \nMarshall Islands, (iv) the Aitutaki Renewable Energy Project in the Cook Islands, and (v) Phase 2 \nof the Renewable Energy Development Project in the Federated States of Micronesia. The \ngeographic scope may be expanded later to include additional countries and additional financing \nto be sought from other sources such as the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. \n6. The proposed TA will also support additional project preparation and pre-implementation\nworks for two projects for consideration in 2019 and are being prepared under ADB TA for\nPreparing the Pacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility\u2014the Solar Power Development\nProject in Nauru and the Increasing Access to Renewable Energy Project in Tuvalu\u2014to enhance \nproject delivery and readiness.\n7. Project 1. The proposed Kiribati South Tarawa Renewable Energy Project will finance\nsolar  photovoltaic  generation  and  a  battery  energy  storage  system;  and  will  support  the\ndevelopment of a renewable energy-enabling environment, including addressing barriers to\nprivate sector investment in Kiribati. It will allow the South Tarawa grid to achieve 26% renewable\nenergy penetration (equivalent to 72% of the government\u2019s target for South Tarawa, which is 36%\nrenewable energy penetration by 2025).10 The project is expected to generate 6.25 gigawatt-\nhours of clean electricity from solar photovoltaic and avoid up to 4,900 tons of carbon dioxide \nequivalent in greenhouse gas emissions per year by 2024. The government requested $5 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, $3.7 million from the Strategic Climate Fund,11 and $2\nmillion from the Government of New Zealand. \n8. Project 2. The proposed Palau Renewable Energy Project will help Palau achieve its\nNationally Determined Contributions target of 22% greenhouse gas emissions reductions below\nits 2005 level by 2025, with a corresponding target of 45% renewable energy contribution in power\ngeneration. The transaction TA facility will help prepare the proposed project by (i) analyzing\nPalau\u2019s electricity demand and supply; (ii) preparing a least-cost generation expansion plan;\n(iii) enumerating corresponding generation investment projects; and (iv) undertaking full technical,\nfinancial, economic, governance, and safeguards due diligence of identified and agreed candidate\ninvestment projects for inclusion in the proposed project.\n9. Project 3. The proposed Marshall Islands Majuro Power Network Strengthening Project\n(Phase  2)  will  fund  (i)  electricity  network  strengthening  measures,  including  network\nreconfiguration,  transformer  replacement,  and  loss-reduction  and  revenue-performance\n9  The four projects approved in 2017\u20132018 are ADB. 2017.

The proposed Aitutaki Renewable Energy Project in the Cook Islands will help \nthe country reach the 100% renewable energy target for Aitutaki, as set out in the Cook Islands \nRenewable Energy Chart Implementation Plan.12 The proposed project will provide additional \nrenewable energy generation capacity to that of the ongoing ADB-funded Renewable Energy \nSector Project.13 Two options will be considered under the proposed project, which will enable \n43% renewable energy penetration on Aitutaki island: installation of 900-kilowatt wind or 1 MW of \nphotovoltaic, with a standby battery and a synchronous condenser.  \n \n11.  Project  5.  The  proposed  Federated  States  of  Micronesia  Renewable  Energy \nDevelopment Project (Phase 2) will finance a small storage reservoir with about 9 MWh and 3 MW \nof hydropower in the Lehnmesi river system in Pohnpei. \n \n12.  Support to improve project readiness. The proposed transaction TA facility will also \ncomplement the project preparatory work being carried out under ADB\u2019s TA for Preparing the \nPacific Renewable Energy Investment Facility: (i) site preparation to increase the readiness of the \nproposed Solar Power Development Project in Nauru for approval in 2019 and (ii) technical and \nenvironmental and social safeguards due diligence for potential floating solar photovoltaic in \nTuvalu. \n \nB.
