While developing Asia has made considerable progress in reducing poverty, far too \nmany  Asians  continue to  live  in  poverty.  If  measured  by  a  poverty  line  of  $2 per  day,  a \nstaggering  1.8  billion,  or  54%,  of  developing  Asia\u2019s  people  were  poor  in  2005.1  Many \ninterventions are important for helping the poor climb out of poverty, but, in the final analysis, \ncountries must be able to generate productive and well-paying employment opportunities for \ntheir workforces. Recognition of this has led to including \u201cfull and productive employment and \ndecent work for all\u201d as a target for achieving Goal 1 of the Millennium Development Goals (i.e., \neradication of extreme poverty and hunger).  \n \n2.  Analysis  of  labor  force  outcomes  in  the  region  indicates  considerable  weaknesses \namong countries\u2019 track records in generating productive and well-paying jobs. This is true even \nfor countries where aggregate indicators of economic performance, such as growth in gross \ndomestic product per capita, have been strong. In India, for example, the transition of the labor \nforce from low-productivity, low-paying jobs in the rural and urban informal sectors to the more \nproductive and better paying formal sector has been exceedingly slow despite an economy that \nhas been among the fastest-growing in the world over the last decade. Along similar lines, \nunemployment and underemployment continue to affect about a quarter of the Philippine labor \nforce as wages for even the typical full-time worker have barely kept up with inflation.2  \n \n3.  What can policymakers in the region do to encourage the growth of good jobs and \nthereby promote inclusive growth? Encouraging employment growth in the public sector is not a \nviable option. Productive and well-paying employment opportunities will have to come from \nprivate enterprises, especially nonagricultural ones. There is a critical role for public policy, \nhowever, because the operation and growth of private enterprises is influenced in important \nways by the policies and strategies adopted by governments to promote industrial development \nand structural transformation. It is in this context that the proposed regional technical assistance \n(TA) seeks to improve our knowledge of how different types of policies and strategies affect \nenterprise growth, especially among small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and the creation of \nproductive and well-paying jobs in the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).3 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4\n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  A feature of nonagricultural employment in many developing countries is that it tends to \nbe concentrated among small enterprises. In fact, it is especially concentrated among the very \nsmall in lower-income developing countries. In both India and the Philippines, for example, the \n                                                 \n1  A poverty line at $2 per day is typical of the national poverty lines used in many developing countries. The numbers \nreported here on $2 poverty (at 2005 purchasing power parity) are based on information from World Bank\u2019s \nPovcalNet  database  (World  Bank.  Available:  http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/jsp/index.jsp)  for  25 \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs). These DMCs account for more than 95% of the population of all DMCs. \n2  For detailed reviews of labor market outcomes in the region, see Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2005. \u201cLabor \nMarkets in Asia: Promoting Full, Productive, and Decent Employment,\u201d In Key Indicators 2005, Manila; and Jesus \nFelipe and Rana Hasan (eds.). 2006. Labor Markets in Asia: Issues and Perspectives, London: Palgrave MacMillan \nfor the Asian Development Bank. \n3  The terms \u201centerprise,\u201d \u201cfirm,\u201d and \u201cestablishment\u201d are used interchangeably here. Strictly speaking, they are \ndistinct concepts. An establishment is a single physical location at which business is conducted or where services \nor industrial operations are performed. An enterprise or firm is a business organization consisting of one or more \ndomestic establishments under common ownership or control. For companies with only one establishment, the \nenterprise and establishment are the same. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2008. \n ", "2   \nshare of total employment in manufacturing accounted for by enterprises with between 5 and 9 \nworkers was over 20% in the 1980s.  This contrasts markedly with higher income DMCs such \nas  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  Taipei,China,  and  Thailand  where  such  enterprises \naccounted for 10% or less of manufacturing employment. 5\n \n5.  The fact that a large fraction of workers is employed in small enterprises is not in and of \nitself a problem. A problem can arise, however, if small enterprises are characterized by very \nlow productivity and wages. While it is the case that labor productivity\u2014a key determinant of \nwages\u2014tends to increase everywhere with the size of enterprise, labor productivity of the \nsmallest enterprises can be particularly low relative to large enterprises in lower-income DMCs: \nThe differential in labor productivity between the smallest and largest enterprises has been \nfound to be on the order of 1:8 or greater in the case of India and the Philippines, for example.6 \nThis can be contrasted with a differential of about 1:3 in several of the other, higher-income \nDMCs. Given the very heterogeneous wage and productivity levels, where it is that jobs are \nbeing created is a matter of considerable importance.  \n \n6.  Under the assumption that it is difficult to improve productivity and earnings of small \nenterprises beyond some relatively low threshold, the foregoing suggests that an expansion of \ngood  jobs  would  require  that  a  greater  share  of  employment  be  accounted  for  by  larger \nenterprises.  Conceptually,  two  types  of  processes  underlie  such  an  expansion:  (i) \ntransformation of small enterprises into more productive, larger ones; and (ii) growth of larger \nenterprises. \n \n7.  The foregoing discussion raises several important questions: \n(i)  How is employment in Asia distributed across various production sectors and \nenterprises?7 How are labor productivity and/or wages distributed across different \nproduction sectors and enterprises?  \n(ii)  What  explains  the  large  heterogeneity  of  wages  and  productivity  across \nenterprise size groups seen in some countries but not others? What elements of \nthe policy environment can explain how firm size is distributed across countries?  \n(iii)  What constrains the growth of enterprises, especially SMEs? To what extent are \nparticular types of policies and strategies adopted by governments at work? To \nwhat  extent  are  market  failures  or  factors  having  to  do  with  enterprises \nthemselves (such as characteristics of entrepreneurs or of the markets to which \nenterprises  cater)  constraints?  What  types  of  policies  and  strategies  can \npolicymakers rely on for promoting enterprise growth? \n(iv)  How does the demand for labor behave in response to the growth of different \ntypes of enterprises? To what extent is the growth of demand for labor biased in \nfavor of skilled workers as enterprises expand and adopt new technologies? \nWhat types of skills are most valued by firms? What are the roles of general, \ntechnical, and vocational education in this regard?  \n \n                                                 \n5  For data on the distribution of manufacturing employment by enterprise size groups, see Dipak Mazumdar and \nSandip Sarkar. 2007. Employment elasticity in organized manufacturing in India. IPC Working Paper Series No. 42. \nAnn Arbor: International Policy Center.  While the data reported are rather dated, it is very likely that the nature of \nthe distributions have not changed fundamentally. Nevertheless, one of the TA\u2019s activities will be to update the \ninformation on the size distribution of enterprises across DMCs. \n6  The low labor productivity of small enterprises in these countries no doubt reflects the use of unsophisticated \ntechnologies to produce what are often low-quality goods catering to the low end of the domestic market. \n7  There are many dimensions according to which enterprises (in any given production sector) vary. Important ones \ninclude size, ownership type, and formal versus informal status. While enterprise size will be the key focus, these \nother dimensions will be examined to the extent allowed by available data. \n ", "3 \n8.  Answers to these questions will be important for formulating policies and strategies \nensuring dynamism among enterprises and the creation of productive and well-paying jobs.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA studies are expected to improve our understanding as to what types of economic \npolicies and strategies are most effective in encouraging the transition of small, low-productivity \nenterprises into higher-productivity ones and expanding the availability of productive and well-\npaying jobs. More specifically, the TA studies are expected to influence the design of policies \nand strategies used to promote SMEs along with education and skills-development initiatives so \nthat these are geared toward the goal of significantly increasing employment prospects and \nearnings of the typical worker. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  address  the  questions  listed  in  para.  7  through  research  studies \nimplemented in two phases. Phase 1 will consist of a relatively broad-based analysis of the TA \nissues using publicly available information on enterprises and a stock-taking of the recent \nliterature on constraints to the growth of enterprises. Output from Phase 1 will be utilized in \nADB\u2019s Key Indicators 2009 for a special chapter on enterprises in Asia. Phase 2 will consist of \nin-depth studies of three DMCs: India, Indonesia, and the Philippines. An in-depth country study \nof similar scope, focusing on Pakistan, will be financed and implemented by ADB\u2019s Central and \nWest Asia Department (CWRD).8 Some analysis will also be carried out on enterprises in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Given the considerable success of the PRC\u2019s manufacturing \nand even services sectors in expanding production, it will be useful to examine how different \ntypes of enterprises have performed and to understand the implications of enterprise growth for \nthe employment and wages of PRC workers. Examining the PRC experience can provide useful \nlessons for public policy in other DMCs. \n \n1.  Phase 1: Broad-Based Analysis \n \n11.  Phase 1 will run from January 2009 through July 2009 and consist of several activities. A \nfirst activity will be to generate a report consisting of metadata (i.e., data about data) on \nenterprise statistics across 13 DMCs.9 The report will provide descriptions of what types of \nenterprise statistics are collected, what methods are used in data collection, comparability of \nstatistics across the DMCs, and the types of data made available for public access (e.g., \nwhether panel data on establishments is available). A second activity will be to develop a \ndatabase on the distribution of employment and such other important economic variables as \nvalue  added,  labor  productivity,  and  wages  according  to  enterprise  size  across  different \nproduction sectors for the 13 DMCs. The database will rely on official publications of national \nstatistics offices.10 A final activity will be to generate an analytical report. In addition to using the \n                                                 \n8T hAeD vBi\u2019es wEsc oenxopmreics Rseedse haercrhe iDn eapraer ttmheonste a ondf  tChWe RcoDn wsuilll tcaonotr dainndat ed ocl onsoetl yn einc deesvsealoriplyin rge tphree sine-dnet pththo ssteu doief sA.

Additional Pacific DMCs will be added based \n \non data availability. \n10 Typically,  national  systems  for  collecting  information  on  enterprises  are  different  for  formal  and  informal \nenterprises. Using one source or the other only would lead to a biased description of how enterprises are \n   ", "4   \ndatabase on enterprises to analyze the questions listed in para. 7(i), the report will use existing \nliterature about establishment-level dynamics, constraints to enterprise growth, and SMEs to \nanalyze the questions listed in para. 7(ii)\u2013(iv). \n \n2.  Phase 2: In-Depth Country Studies in India, Indonesia, and the Philippines11 \n \n12.  The studies will undertake detailed country-specific analysis of what explains enterprise \nsize and its distribution, the factors constraining the growth of SMEs, the types of policies and \nstrategies that can alleviate these constraints, and how the demand for labor may be expected \nto respond to enterprise growth (along with implications for labor earnings). The focus will be on \nthe manufacturing and services sectors. \n \n13.  A specific program of research for each country study will be developed in consultation \nwith relevant national agencies and international and national experts on industrial development \nand SME issues (including experts at ADB). The consultation process will be facilitated by the \npreparation  during  January\u2013May  2009  of  country-specific  stock-taking  studies,12  detailed \nmetadata  on  enterprise  statistics,  and  a  detailed  review  of  recent  international  literature. \nInception workshops will be held in each of the countries around June 2009. Country-specific \nprograms of research will be finalized at latest by September 2009.  \n \n14.  The country studies will examine the issues noted above through (i) rigorous analysis of \nenterprise data from existing industrial censuses and/or nationally representative surveys, (ii) \nfollow-up analysis based on primary surveys of enterprises and workers or evaluation of an \nexisting program aimed at promoting enterprises and/or entrepreneurship, and (iii) qualitative \ncase studies based on key informant interviews and focus group discussions. \n \n15.  A number of issues raised by recent literature will be important to consider in developing \nthe  country  studies,  including  (among  others)  the  role  of  entrepreneurship,  limitations  of \nenterprise surveys in ascertaining constraints to growth of enterprises (and especially those \nstemming from market failures), and challenges in measuring skills. Appendix 2 describes these \nissues in detail, along with some possible approaches that could be used. It will be important to \nfully flesh out these approaches before implementing the studies (i.e., prior to October 2009).  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000. It will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \ntechnical assistance funding program and cover consulting services; training and workshops; \ndata collection, assessment, and analysis; equipment; and administrative and support costs. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \ndistributed. For an unbiased description, information on both formal and informal enterprises is required. It will be \nimportant, therefore, that the database consist of both informal and formal sector enterprises. \n11 These DMCs were chosen for several reasons. First, the in-depth country studies will require the availability of (i) \nhigh-quality enterprise data and labor force survey data to capture enterprise and worker-related statistics, and (ii) \nadministrative data that can capture important elements of the policy and broader economic environments in which \nenterprises operate. Second, executing the in-depth country studies will require a relatively high minimum level of \ntechnical capacity among national consultants. All three countries, as well as Pakistan, satisfy both requirements. \nIn addition, they are large countries with considerable diversity in enterprise- and worker-related outcomes. This \ndiversity helps in understanding the key constraints to enterprise growth. \n12 A country-specific stock-taking study will also be carried out for the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  administered  by  the \nEconomics and Research Department. Confirmation of no-objection will be obtained from the \ngovernment of each DMC participating in phase 2 (PRC, India, Indonesia, and the Philippines) \nprior to starting TA activities, in coordination with their regional departments.  \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from January 2009 to July 2011 and finance 41 person-\nmonths of consulting services: 6 international and 35 national. Consultants will be selected and \nengaged individually by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time). The TA will also finance survey work in selected DMCs. A \nnational institution will be engaged through consultant qualification selection for the survey work \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The choice of consultant \nqualification selection stems from the relatively small budget for the survey work (less than \n$100,000 per survey) and the straightforward nature of the survey work. The terms of reference \nof the consultants and survey work are in Appendix 4.    \n \n19.  ADB  will  procure  computer  hardware,  software,  data  entry  devices,  and  technical \nmanuals in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand this equipment will be disposed of in accordance with instructions on administering grant-\nfinanced technical assistance.13\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nEnterprise Development and the Challenge of Inclusive Growth, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n \n13 ADB. 2008.

A number of issues raised by recent literature will be important to consider in developing \nthe in-depth country studies of phase 2. First, the analysis of enterprise size and its distribution \nshould be sensitive to the economics literature on the determinants of firm size. It should show a \nclear understanding as to the limits of the available data and empirical framework used in \ndistinguishing between competing explanations.1   \n \n2.  Second, a number of recent studies have questioned whether small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs)\u2014and especially the smaller enterprises among them and those operating in \nthe informal sector\u2014can be engines of growth. For example, Del Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff  \ncompare the characteristics of own-account workers in Sri Lanka with owners of larger firms.2 \nTheir findings suggest that, for the most part, own-account workers are more like wageworkers \nthan owners of larger firms, and they are unlikely to expand and become employers. Similarly, \nLa Porta and Shleifer use information from the World Bank\u2019s enterprise surveys carried out in \nnearly 100 countries and find that virtually none of the formal enterprises have ever been \ninformal, strongly suggesting that the typical informal and/or small enterprise is very unlikely to \ngraduate into a larger, formal enterprise.3 It is important to examine these findings more closely \nin the context of specific countries. If it is true that small enterprises are unlikely to deliver in \ngenerating good jobs, then the focus of policy may have to be on understanding the constraints \nto growth among larger enterprises and relieving these.  \n \n3.  Third, determining the key constraints to growth of enterprises is not straightforward. \nConceptually, it is useful to think about constraints as stemming from two types of failures: \ngovernment failures and market failures. Government failures are typically considered to result \nfrom (among others) regulatory barriers to entry, exit, and competition; poor provision of public \ninfrastructure  inputs;  and  weak  mechanisms  for  contract  enforcement.  Market  failures  are \nlikewise believed to stem from various sources, including credit market imperfections, learning \nexternalities, and coordination failures. Much of the recent empirical work has focused on \nexamining the role of government failures, and, insofar as market failures are concerned, the \nemphasis has been on credit market imperfections. Less attention seems to have been paid to \nevaluating the impacts of learning externalities and coordination failures.4 Given that market \nfailures stemming from the latter might be particularly critical for entrepreneurs contemplating \nmore efficient (but perhaps riskier) production methods or production of nontraditional products, \nthe omission seems to be a serious one. Careful consideration will need to be given to empirical \napproaches that can capture both government and market failures in a more balanced way.  \n                                                 \n1  Krishna B. Kumar, Raghuram G. Rajan, and Luigi Zingales (2001. What determines firm size? CRSP Working \nPaper No. 496. Chicago: Center for Research in Security Prices, Graduate School of Business, University of \nChicago.) provide a useful discussion of existing theories, breaking these down in terms of three broad categories: \ntechnological, organizational, and institutional. They examine how industry-specific and country-specific factors \naffect the size of corporations across 15 European nations. From a methodological standpoint, the paper argues \nthat empirical estimates of the impact of interactions between industry characteristics and country characteristics \non firm size are particularly useful in discriminating between different explanations of firm size.  \n2  Del Mel, Suresh, David McKenzie, and Christopher Woodruff. 2008.

Fourth, an increasingly popular tool used in the analysis of constraints to growth of \nenterprises has been to conduct surveys of enterprise managers. Though no doubt useful\u2014and \nsome enterprise surveys are expected to be conducted in this project\u2014it is important to bear in \nmind some limitations of this approach: (i) the analysis of responses from existing surveys may \nbe subject to survivor bias,5 and (ii) the role of market failures (as opposed to government \nfailures) may be particularly difficult to tease out from enterprise surveys. This is especially so if \nthe most serious market failures stem from learning externalities or coordination failures. For \nexample, enterprises involved in agro-processing might grow rapidly if a cold storage logistics \nsystem were developed but not until then. A generic enterprise survey would be unlikely to \nuncover this market failure constraining growth. \n \n5.  Fifth, the fact that virtually all governments have in place a variety of programs and \ninterventions for promoting SMEs suggests that an impact-evaluation-type study holds promise. \nOf course, the set of programs and interventions actually being undertaken would clearly limit \nwhat could be studied (as well as the willingness of the agency administering the program or \nintervention to collaborate in an impact evaluation). Ideally, the impact evaluation would be able \nto consider not only interventions aimed at improving access to finance and/or provision of \nfinance  at  subsidized  rates  (which  seem  to  be  the  most  common  interventions)  but  also \ninterventions  aimed  at  alleviating  market  failures  related  to  learning  and/or  coordination \nexternalities (and perhaps interventions that remove legal and regulatory constraints that may \nbe affecting SME development). \n \n6.  Sixth, the process of structural transformation also affects the composition of the labor \nforce. In particular, we see a significant increase in the participation of women in the labor force \nas a country becomes more industrialized. In the context of firm size, there are no a priori \ntheories  predicting  the  connection  between  firm  size  and  female  labor  force  participation. \nHowever, empirical evidence suggests that a larger share of female workers within an industry \nis associated with lower average wages. As far as the data will allow, we will analyze whether \nany  linkages  can  be  statistically  discerned  between  the  development  of  enterprises,  the \nemployment of women workers, and the evolution of wages. \n \n7.  Finally, the analysis of the employment-related implications of enterprise growth, and \nespecially the relationship between production technologies and skills required of workers, will \nrequire a search for innovative approaches. For example, while many studies have examined \nthe demand for skilled versus unskilled labor in the context of globalization, there are several \nmethodological issues that prevent firm conclusions from being drawn. In the first place, the \ndefinition of skills remains essentially a black box; researchers are forced to rely on using either \neducational attainment of workers or their classification as production or nonproduction workers \nas proxy measures for skills. Neither approach is particularly satisfactory. The situation appears \nto be even worse for technology. In particular, available data sets on enterprises provide very \nlittle by way of distinguishing whether the production process being used is modern versus \ntraditional (or otherwise for characterizing the technology involved). It may be the case that the \nanalysis of employment issues will have to rely more on qualitative case studies conducted \nusing interviews with key informants. \n \n                                                 \n5  In a nutshell, the problem is that, by relying on responses from existing enterprises, we may be drawing inferences \non what is or is not a constraint using responses from enterprises that were able to tackle problems which may be \npreventing others from investing and setting up shop in the first place or from surviving in case they had entered \nthe market. \n   ", "10   Appendix 2 \n \n8.  Clearly, some of the issues raised above may not be easy to resolve. Nevertheless, \nthere are approaches that hold promise. First, enterprise-level data with geographic markers \ncan be used alongside information on location-specific characteristics (such as proximity to \nmajor markets or to other producers, average demographic characteristics of workers, banking \nfacilities, road networks, and indicators of local regulations and institutions) to examine how the \navailability  or  presence  of  various  factors  influences  the  size  distribution  and  growth  of \nenterprises, employment, and wages. Similarly, information on the particular industrial goods \nbeing produced by enterprises can be used along the lines of Rajan and Zingales, whereby \nvariations  in  the  pattern  of  enterprise  growth  across  relevant  industrial  characteristics  and \ngeographic locations is used to infer the factors constraining enterprise growth.6,7 Finally, follow-\nup analysis based on retrospective interviews of previously surveyed enterprises presents a \nuseful  way  for  dealing  with  the  survivor  bias  involved  in  interviewing  currently  existing \nenterprises only. Of course, it will be important to fully flesh out these approaches prior to \nimplementing the studies.  \n \n                                                 \n6  Raghuram G. Rajan and Luigi Zingales (1998. Financial dependence and growth. American Economic Review \n88(3): 559\u201386) use data from the United States to categorize industries in terms of whether or not they are \ndependent on external finance. They then examine whether such industries are more or less likely to emerge in \nother countries. They find that industries especially dependent on external finance develop more slowly in countries \nwith weak financial markets, indicating that finance may be a binding constraint to growth, but more so in particular \nindustries than others. This approach has recently been used by Poonam Gupta, Rana Hasan, and Utsav Kumar \n(forthcoming. Big Reforms but Small Payoffs: Explaining the Weak Record of Growth in Indian Manufacturing. New \nDelhi: India Policy Forum.) to determine whether state level measures of infrastructure provision, labor regulation, \nand financial development influence patterns of industrial development in India. \n7  The interplay between enterprise dynamics and geographical location seem particularly important to study. John S. \nFelkner  and  Robert  M.  Townsend  (2007.  Enterprise  and  wealth  of  villages.  Available: \nhttp://cier.uchicago.edu/papers/2006/felkner_townsend_2006.pdf), for example, show how geography and space \nimportantly influence occupational shifts and movements into entrepreneurship in Thailand. \n ", "Appendix 3   11 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \n \nTotal \nItem \nCost \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Financinga    \n1.

The  consultant  will  be  an  economist  or  statistician  with  excellent  knowledge  about \nenterprise  statistics.  The  consultant  will  prepare  metadata  on  enterprise  statistics  and  a \ndatabase on production- and employment-related statistics for enterprises in 13 developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs)  using  publications  of  national  statistics  offices  and  international \ndatabases  such  as  the  United  Nations  Industrial  Development  Organization\u2019s  Industrial \nStatistics database and the International Labour Organization\u2019s Key Indicators of the Labor \nMarket database. The DMCs are Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji Islands, India, \nIndonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Taipei,China, Thailand, \nand Viet Nam.  \n \n2.  The main information that will need to be collected includes: \n(i)  Metadata  on  enterprise  statistics.  Basic  information  on  enterprise  statistics \nacross 13 DMCs will be provided using publications of national statistics offices. \n(ii)  Tabulated  data  on  the  distribution  of  economic  data  by  enterprise  and/or \nestablishment  size.  Tabulations  are  required  for  distribution  of  employment, \noutput,  value  added,  wage  bill,  fixed  assets,  and  number  of  enterprises  by \nenterprise size groups. To the extent possible, the tabulations should be provided \nby major production sector (agriculture, industry, manufacturing subsector, and \nservices) and by formal and informal sectors. If possible, tabulations should also \nbe  provided  separately  by  ownership  structure  (for  example,  private  sector \nversus public sector). Tabulations are required for the latest year available as \nwell as for earlier years spaced approximately 10 years apart. The consultant will \nneed to take considerable care in documenting the comparability of statistics \nacross countries. In particular, attention will need to be given to the definitions \nand coverage of the underlying enterprise statistics across countries. \n(iii)  Basic output and employment statistics for industries classified at the one-digit \nindustry  level  (for  example,  divisions  A\u2013J  in  terms  of  Standard  Industrial \nClassification) for the latest year available as well as for earlier years spaced \napproximately 10 years apart. \n \n3.

International Consultant: Economist\u2014Analysis of Size Distribution and \nConstraints to Enterprise Growth (1 person-month, intermittent) \n4.  The  consultant  should  have  a  strong  background  in  development  economics  and \nextensive experience working on industrial development issues, especially with reference to \nAsian economies. The main task of the consultant will be to prepare a report that analyzes the \nsize distribution of enterprises across Asian economies, the factors that constrain the growth of \nenterprises (especially small and medium-sized ones), and the links between enterprise growth \nand employment creation. The contents of the report will serve as inputs to a special chapter on \nenterprises in Asia for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Key Indicators 2009 publication. \n \n5.  The consultant\u2019s report will: \n(i)  Describe the size distribution of enterprises in developing Asian countries. The \nreport will utilize tabulated distribution data on enterprises (to be provided by \n ", "Appendix 4        13 \nADB staff) to examine how employment, value added, wage bill, fixed assets, \nand  labor  productivity  are  distributed  across  enterprise  size  groups  (where \nenterprise  size  is  measured  in  terms  of  number  of  workers)  and  by  major \nproduction sectors. The analysis will reveal whether, and in which countries, the \nsize distribution of enterprises is characterized by (a) strong concentration of \nworkers in small firms, (b) large differentials in labor productivity and/or wages by \nenterprise  size,  and  (c)  a  \u201cmissing  middle\u201d  whereby  much  employment  is \naccounted  for  by  small  and  large  enterprises.  Further,  the  analysis  should \ndescribe whether a size distribution characterized by a missing middle has any \nspecial consequences for economic performance.  \n(ii)  Explain  the  policy  and  institutional  factors  that  may  be  influencing  size \ndistributions  and  their  evolution.  The  report  will  discuss  various  policy  and \ninstitutional factors that may explain the patterns of size distributions seen across \nDMCs and the changes in size distributions over time. The types of policy and \ninstitutional  factors  should  be  guided  by  existing  literature  and  country \nexperiences. Examples would include the stance of trade policy, industrial policy \n(encompassing  policies  and  strategies  adopted  by  governments  to  foster \nindustrial  development  and  technological  capabilities),  business  regulations, \nlabor regulations, credit market imperfections, as well as education and training \npolicies.  \n(iii)  Relate the size distribution of enterprises to constraints on small enterprises. The \nreport  will  draw  upon  existing  literature  to  explain  why  some  economies  in \ndeveloping Asia seem to have been successful in having dynamic small-scale \nsectors (i.e., small enterprises that are able to generate relatively high earnings \nfor their employees and/or small enterprises that are able to grow into larger \nenterprises). The reports will provide lessons from the success stories for those \ncountries with lagging small-scale sectors. \n(iv)  Examine the employment-related implications of enterprise growth. It will address \nthe  following  questions:  Which  production  sectors  and  types  of  firms  are \ngenerating reasonably well-paying jobs? What factors can explain the patterns \nwe see? To what extent is the growth of demand for labor biased in favor of \nskilled workers as enterprises expand and adopt new technologies? What are the \ntypes of skills that are being most valued by firms? What are the roles of general, \ntechnical, and vocational education in this regard? \n \n6.

The metadata will describe: \n(i)  Key definitions pertaining to enterprises (including definitions of establishments, \nenterprises, and firms) used by the national statistical system of the country. \n(ii)  The system in place among national statistics offices and relevant administrative \nagencies  for  collecting  enterprise  statistics  for  different  types  of  enterprises \n(including formal and informal sector enterprises; public and private enterprises; \nsmall, medium, and large enterprises) and wages and/or earnings1 for different \ntypes of workers. \n(iii)  The types of surveys and censuses carried out for collecting enterprise statistics, \nas well as for employment and wages and/or earnings statistics; how often these \nare collected; and public dissemination policies regarding data. \n(iv)  Reliability of population frames and business registers upon which surveys and \ncensuses are based.  \n(v)  Ability of business registers or statistical systems accurately to capture formation \nand dissolution of enterprises; ability of statistical systems to track migration of \nworkers. \n(vi)  Availability of panel data on enterprises, workers, and matching enterprise and \nworker survey data. \n(vii)  Weaknesses in the systems for collecting enterprise statistics, as well as data on \nemployment and wages and/or earnings. Priority areas for improvement should \nbe described.

The report will:  \n(i)  Describe recent trends in enterprise growth and the evolution of employment and \nwages for different types of enterprises and across the major production sectors. \nDocumentation  of  entry  and  exit  and  the  life  spans  of  different  types  of \nenterprises will be useful. \n(ii)  Discuss the policy and institutional factors that are believed to drive these trends. \nThe  relevant  elements  of  these  factors  would  include  (among  others)  trade \n                                                 \n1  It may be noted that wages and earnings are related but distinct concepts. Wages refer to payments made for work \ncarried out over a specific period of time (for example, per hour, per day). Earnings depend on wages and the \namount of time worked.
