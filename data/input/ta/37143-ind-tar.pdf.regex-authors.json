INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Studies carried out by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development \npartners have documented the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV during \nthe implementation of infrastructure projects.1 Roads, in particular, while bringing many benefits, \nincrease risks through greater mobility and connectivity.  The investment component of the \nupcoming North Eastern State Roads Investment Program will finance the reconstruction and \nupgrading  of  about  1,000  kilometers  of  state  roads  and  highways  in  north  eastern  states \nbetween  2010  and  2012.  Consultations  with  government,  civil  society,  and  private  sector \npartners in New Delhi, Assam, Meghalaya, and Nagaland identified the need for (i) ensuring the \nprevention and mitigation of impacts of inherent health, social and gender, and safety risks \nassociated  with  infrastructure  development;  (ii)  fostering  tripartite  partnerships  among \ngovernment (state public works departments, state AIDS control societies [SACSs]), civil society \norganizations (CSOs), and the private sector for a more effective and sustainable response to \nthe epidemic; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of civil works contractors to comply with the \nprovisions  set  by  the  International  Federation  of  Consulting  Engineers  in  the  Multilateral \nDevelopment Banks\u2019 Harmonized General Conditions of Contract for Construction.2 \n \n2.  The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)3 will  be  implemented  in  five \nselected north eastern states (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland). TA fact-\nfinding missions in May\u2013July 2007 at central, state, and district levels and follow-on discussions \nwith the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) and the Joint United Nations Programme \non HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) in April 2009 confirmed the relevance of the proposed activities under \nthe TA as well as the governments\u2018 commitment to work with ADB in the implementation of the \nproposed activities.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The new 2007 HIV estimates released by NACO, supported by UNAIDS and the World \nHealth Organization, indicate that national adult HIV prevalence in India is about 0.34%, which \ncorresponds to an estimated 2.3 million Indian adults (15\u201349 years). State-specific variations in \nthe profile of the epidemic have been observed: several states in the north eastern region have \nshown higher HIV prevalence and multiple routes of HIV transmission with diversity between \nand within states. \n \n4.  In the north eastern region, the HIV epidemic has progressed beyond the prototype of \nbeing driven by injecting drug use, with heterosexual transmission an equally important driver. \nMost of the HIV-related services were concentrated in urban settings, and the geographical \nreach into rural areas was poor. Women with unequal access to health and nutrition and a lower \nlevel of participation in social and political decision-making processes are particularly at a \ndisadvantage, increasing their vulnerability to HIV significantly. Nagaland and Manipur are high-\nprevalence states in the north eastern region. Mizoram is highly vulnerable and Meghalaya has \n                                                \n1  World Health Organization. 2003. Integrating Gender into HIV/AIDS Programs: A Review Paper.

The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2018s website on 29 June \n2009. \n ", "2   \n \nreported a very low number of HIV infections and AIDS cases, but there are indications that it is \nhigher. In recognition of the importance of the north eastern region, NACO has established a \nNorth East Regional Office based in Guwahati (Assam) that is responsible for coordinating \ngovernment  and  development  partners'  interventions.  United  Nations  (UN)  agencies,  with \nfinancial support from the Australian Agency for International Development and the Swedish \nInternational Development Cooperation Agency, are implementing a joint UN initiative in the \nnorth eastern region, coordinated by the UNAIDS Secretariat. \n \n5.  ADB\u2018s HIV/AIDS strategic directions\u2018 paper5 acknowledges differences in power relations \nbetween men and women and the persistence of gender-based discriminatory practices as \ncritical factors contributing to the spread of the epidemic. ADB\u2018s commitment to a multisector \nand gender-responsive approach to HIV interventions\u2014embedded in the strategic directions \npaper\u2014has been reiterated in the Joint Initiative by Development Agencies for the Infrastructure \nSectors to Mitigate the Spread of HIV/AIDS6 signed by ADB and other development partners in \n2006 and the Operational Plan for Improving Health under Strategy 2020.7 Most recently, ADB\u2018s \nStrategy 20208 reiterates ADB\u2018s commitment to the mitigation of HIV risks and impacts in its \nportfolio  by  continuing  to  incorporate  activities  to  control  the  transmission  and  spread  of \ncommunicable diseases, particularly HIV, in its transport and other infrastructure projects. \n \n6.  The size of the forthcoming road investment program, the reach of its projected adverse \nimpacts, and their links to the main engine of HIV transmission in the north eastern region \nrequire a deliberate and proportionate response from ADB. In this context, addressing the \nneeds of women and children\u2014reaching out to far-flung districts by strengthening the network of \nservices in partnership with the state machinery as well as other community-based service \nproviders\u2014is critical. Crosscutting issues such as capacity building, advocacy, quality systems, \ninter-sector collaboration, and monitoring and evaluation will have to be addressed. \n \n  III.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact of the TA will be reduced incidence of STIs and HIV among construction \nworkers,  sex  workers,  migrant  workers,  and  local  communities  in  the  project  area;  and \naddressing some of the factors that contribute to their vulnerability. Its expected outcome will be \nexpanded networks and stronger service delivery capabilities for HIV prevention in five north \neastern states (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, and Nagaland) through public\u2013private \npartnership. The TA will complement the existing effort of NACO in the north eastern region. \nThe TA was developed in 2007 in consultation with the Ministry of Development of the north \neastern region, NACO, relevant state government agencies (public works departments and \nSACSs),  and  CSOs  involved  in  HIV  prevention  in  the  project  area.  The  TA  design  and \nimplementation arrangements are informed by the national framework set out in the National \nAIDS Control Programme III (2006\u20132011) (NACP III)9 and related operational guidelines issued \nby NACO. It reflects lessons learned and good practices in implementing HIV preventive actions \nin the north eastern region.  \n \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2005.

The  activities  under  the  TA  components  will  aim  to  (i)  set  a  project  baseline  and \nmonitoring and evaluation system (component 1); (ii) assess the institutional framework for HIV \nprevention in the infrastructure sector (component 2); (iii) develop and roll out HIV training and \nskills transfer programs targeting economic operators (component 3); (iv) develop the capacity \nof state civil society organizations and trade unions (component 4); and (v) implement direct \ninterventions for HIV prevention (component 5). The TA outputs will include (i) a TA work plan to \nensure that the TA activities fit with NACP III; (ii) capacity needs assessments; (iii) behavioral \nbaseline reports; (iv) situation analyses reports on institutional framework; (v) training tools and \nmaterial; (vi) project impact assessment; (vii) capacity development initiatives of selected state \ngovernment, CSOs, economic operators, and trade unions; (viii) HIV direct interventions; (ix) \ntechnical report on mitigating the social risks and impacts of road projects in the north eastern \nregion; and (x) assessment of TA tripartite partnership modalities. \n \nComponent 1: Project Baseline and Monitoring and Evaluation System \n \n9.  This component will support close monitoring of implementation of the TA and regularly \nassess its progress. It will generate insights on the nexus between HIV transmission, road \nconstruction, and high-risk behavior. A research institute with established capabilities for health \nresearch will be subcontracted to (i) do baseline mapping and gap analysis of local services at \nthe district level,10 subject to the gaps identified in the mapping undertaken by NACO; and \n(ii) develop and carry out a monitoring and evaluation framework for the project. Information \ncollected  will  include  (i)  HIV  risk  and  vulnerability  assessment  among  groups  that  will  be \naffected  by  the  infrastructure  operation;  and  (ii)  capacity  needs  assessment  of  economic \noperators,  CSOs,  including  nongovernment  organization  (NGOs),  community-based \norganizations, people living with HIV (PLHIV) organizations, and trade unions in the corridor of \ninfluence  of  the  project.  Six  monthly  reports  will  be  produced  and  distributed  to  relevant \nstakeholders. The final report will present the key findings of the surveys and provide a review \nof the tripartite partnership modalities. It will identify options for the institutionalization of the \napproach in other states, infrastructure development, and other sector-specific interventions. \n \nComponent 2: Institutional Framework for HIV Prevention in the Infrastructure Sector \n \n10.  The component will assess (i) policy commitments to gender and HIV/AIDS at central \nlevel and their incorporation in state-specific infrastructure sector strategies, master plans, and \nregulatory frameworks for public investments, construction, contractor accreditation, mobile and \nmigrant  population,  workplace,  and  labor  environment;  (ii)  existing  government  agencies, \neconomic  operators,  and  CSOs  involved  in  HIV  prevention;  (iii) transport  and  construction \ncompanies\u2018 and associations\u2018 response to the epidemic; and (iv) existing arrangements and \npublic\u2013private partnership modalities for the mitigation of health and other social risks inherent \nin  infrastructure  development. The situation  analysis  report  will  inform  NACO  and  SACSs\u2018 \nimplementation  of  the  NACP  III  and  interventions  proposed  to  support  infrastructure \ndevelopment in the north eastern region. \n \nComponent 3: HIV Training and Skills Transfer Programs Targeting Economic Operators \n \n11.  Training sessions will be offered to a core group of economic operators. These include (i) \nthe  private  business  sector,  with  its  subgroups\u2014individual  construction  and  transportation \nfirms\u2014represented by their chief executive officers and human resources managers; industry \nassociations,  trade  unions,  and  business  chambers  representing  the  construction  and \n                                                \n10 Existing mapping data will be taken into account and gaps addressed. \n ", "4   \n \ntransportation sectors; (ii) health service (clinic and non-clinic based) providers; and (iii) condom \nmanufacturers and distributors. The training sessions will aim at building the capacities of \ncontractors to develop and implement workplace health and safety policies and preventive \ninterventions in the project site, and promote compliance with the NACP III, national guidelines, \nand  other  applicable  regulations.  Between  training  and  refresher  training  sessions,  trained \nboard members and human resources managers of selected companies will provide training for \ntheir companies\u2018 employees, subcontractors, and consultants, at their own initiative and cost.11 \n \nComponent 4: Capacity Development for State Civil Society Organizations and Trade \nUnions \n \n12.  Based on a needs assessment, this component will support a training program for \ncapacity  development  of  selected  state  NGOs,  community-based  organizations,  PLHIV \norganizations, and trade unions (up to 10 per state, depending on the results of the needs \nassessment at district level) involved in HIV awareness and behavior change in the project area. \nIndicatively,  the  capacity  development  program  inputs  will  involve  training,  exposure  visits, \n\u2015hand holding\u2016 or mentoring, and knowledge- and experience-sharing workshops. \n \nComponent 5: Direct Interventions for HIV Prevention \n \n13.  This component will address gaps identified in the project area and complement the \nongoing targeted interventions of SACSs. Direct interventions for HIV prevention (up to 3 per \nstate) will be carried out by state CSOs along ADB-financed highways and will be informed by \nNACO\u2018s standard operational guidelines. All activities will be preceded by a review of existing \ndata sources, risk assessment studies and supplemental mapping of hotspots (points of sex \nsolicitation), prioritized industry or workforce centers and large residential areas, and preferred \nhealth  providers.  Activities  will  target  construction  workers  in  the  campsites  and  local \ncommunities directly affected by the infrastructure operation and may include STI and condom \nservices provision within NACP III objectives in the project area. Pilot interventions to test \neffective modalities to promote the economic empowerment of PLHIV\u2014with focus on widows, \ndestitute single mothers, women heads of households, and sex workers\u2014may be supported \nthrough alternative livelihood and self-employment training initiatives, in line with  NACP III \nstrategies and linkage with line departments implementing similar programs. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,770,000. TA fact-finding missions in May\u2013July \n2007 at central, state, and district levels and follow-on discussions with the NACO and UNAIDS \nin April 2009 confirmed the relevance of the proposed activities under the TA as well as the \ngovernments' commitment to work with ADB in the implementation of the proposed activities.   \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  NACO will be the executing agency for the TA and NACO\u2018s North East Regional Office \n(NERO), through the UNAIDS Secretariat in New Delhi, will be the implementing agency. The \nUNAIDS  Secretariat  will  act  as  TA  coordinator  and  be  responsible\u2014in  consultation  with \nUNAIDS Secretariat in New Delhi\u2014for the recruitment of all consulting services under this \n                                                \n11 Activities will be extended to existing networks of companies\u2014e.g., Confederation of Indian Industry, Federation of \nIndian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, North East Chamber of Commerce, All India Organization of \nEmployers, transport sector organizations (e.g., Transport Corporation of India), petroleum-refining companies\u2014\nemployers\u2018 and workers\u2018 organizations, and other allied organizations and structures at the state/district level. \n ", "5 \n \nproject, in accordance with ADB\u2018s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The UNAIDS Secretariat will be responsible for the overall coordination of the \nTA activities, supporting the NACO North East Regional Office, mobilizing the expertise of other \nUN partner agencies12 in a timely matter, as needed, and effectively liaising with ADB. It will \nsubmit a detailed work plan to ADB at project onset\u2014in consultation with NACO and NERO\u2014to \nensure the consistency of TA activities with the NACP III.  \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  36  months,  commencing  in  February  2010  with \ncompletion 3 years later in 2013. Consultants\u2018 inputs will amount to 39 person-months for \nnational consultants, 9 months for a national research institute, 12 months for a national training \ninstitute; and 120 months for five service delivery NGOs (24 months each, 1 per state). However, \nthe specific terms of reference in Appendix 4 will be refined following TA inception. \n \n17.  Detailed implementation arrangements are in Appendix 3. With respect to disbursement, \nfunds  to  be  transferred  by  ADB  to  UNDP  shall  be  paid  (para.  9[a],  MOU)  in  semiannual \ninstallments in advance of the implementation of planned activities with the amount of the \ninstallment based on the commitments and liabilities that UNDP estimates it will make during \nthe next semiannual period, unless otherwise agreed by ADB and UNDP. With respect to \nprocurement,  funds  transferred  by  ADB  to  UNAIDS  via  UNDP  (India)  shall  be  used  for \nprocurement of equipment, goods, and services from eligible ADB member countries only (para. \n22[b], MOU), which will be accomplished under open and competitive selection (para. 23[b], \nMOU). All procurement of goods, equipment, and services using funds transferred by ADB to \nUNAIDS  for  the  TA  shall  be  carried  out  using,  and  in  accordance  with,  UNDP  policies, \nprocedures, and documentation for the procurement of goods, equipment, and services as set \nout in the UNDP Procurement User Guide and as agreed upon under the MOU. UNAIDS will \nselect  and  subcontract  designated  subnational  partners  (e.g.,  national  research  institute, \ntraining  institute,  and  service  delivery  NGOs),  applying  the  selection  criteria  set  forth  in \nSupplementary Appendix A. The organization chart of the NACO North East Regional Office in \nAssam is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n18.  The  UNAIDS  Secretariat  will  produce  an  inception  report  2  months  after  the \ncommencement of services, and submit biannual technical and financial progress reports and a \nfinal report to ADB (with copy to the Ministry of Development of the North East Region, NACO, \nState Public Works Department, State Department of Women and Child Development, and \nState Social Welfare Department). The final report by UNAIDS will include comments provided \nby NACO and ADB within 30 days after the final tripartite meeting. The report will be submitted \nin English and should include technical analyses supported by data, with administrative and \nother details in appendixes. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,475,000  to  the \nGovernment of India to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for Fighting \nHIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific for Addressing Social and Health Issues Associated with Road \nImprovement in Selected North Eastern States (Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Manipur, and \nNagaland), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n12  UNAIDS brings together the efforts and resources of 10 UN system organizations to the global AIDS response. \nCosponsors include, among others, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the International Labour \nOrganization. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \nReduced incidence of  Reduced high-risk sexual behavior,  Government (NACO), UN,  Assumption \nSTIs and HIV among  STI and HIV incidence and  and other development  Government\u2018s commitment \nconstruction workers, sex  prevalence among construction  partners\u2018 official  to a multisector approach to \nworkers, migrant workers,  workers, sex workers, and migrant  information and data   the HIV epidemic \nand local communities in  workers \nthe project area \nOutcome       \nExpanded networks and  Increased number of networks  Government, UN, and  Assumptions \nstronger service delivery  capable of delivering HIV  other development  NACO North East Regional \ncapabilities for HIV  interventions (20% from baseline  partners\u2018 reports  Office functions effectively \nprevention in five north- [2009])   \nReports from regular  Satisfactory participation of \neastern states through \nmonitoring  TA target groups and \npublic\u2013private partnership \n  beneficiaries \nProject impact assessment \nTA final report  Risk \nChange in security \nconditions in the five north \neastern states  \nOutputs       \n1.
