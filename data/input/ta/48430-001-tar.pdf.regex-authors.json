INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  A number of Asian export-import banks and export credit agencies (ECAs) were created \nduring the course of the economic development of many Asian countries in line with the export \nstrategies of their respective governments. Over the years, these Asian export-import banks and \nECAs have evolved into widely differing financial institutions  depending upon the business \nenvironment in the respective countries, their foreign trade profiles, country risk considerations, \nand  the  development  tracks  of  local  financial  markets.  To  develop  and  enhance  regional \ncooperation, forge stronger links among these institutions, and exchange information and share \nideas in a structured manner, a first meeting was held in 1996 in India at the initiative of the \nExport-Import Bank of India, and this led to the formation of the Asian EXIM Banks Forum \n(AEBF).  \n \n2.  The seven initial participants were export-import banks and ECAs from Australia, the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India, Japan,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  Malaysia,  and Thailand. \nSubsequently, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam joined the AEBF, resulting in a total of \n10 AEBF member countries, followed by Cambodia as an observer.  \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) first became involved in the AEBF when ADB \nhosted the 9th AEBF Annual Meeting at ADB headquarters in November 2003. Since then, ADB \nhas been invited as a permanent observer at AEBF annual meetings and its technical working \ngroup (TWG) and training committee meetings. ADB's role is to help design and organize AEBF \nconferences, seminars, and workshops, as well as to provide technical advice and resource \npersons. In this role, ADB has provided financial support for the training participation of selected \nAsian export-import banks, ECAs, and government staff, and sponsored ADB and external \nexperts as resource persons on specific areas. \n \n4.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will help train and increase the capacity of \nAEBF members and observers on the training curriculums from October 2015 to October 2018, \nresulting  in  stronger  partnerships  and  collaboration  among  these  institutions  and  regional \nexpansion for the AEBF. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  The proposed TA will help address the actual and growing challenges faced by the \nAsian export-import banks and ECAs and those within the AEBF. First, there is a lack of \nknowledge and capacity of staff in Asian export-import banks and ECAs for business practices \nin different areas. Therefore, a conducive and sound platform for knowledge sharing by way of \ntraining programs is needed to learn best practices in areas as diverse as project financing, \ncapital markets, small and medium-sized enterprise financing, and cross-border investment. \nADB can support this as it has facilities that are designed for workshops and training programs \nand staff who are experienced in designing and organizing training programs. Further, ADB has \nexpert staff eligible to be resource persons for the training programs. Moreover, ADB\u2019s wide \nnetwork  and  cooperation  with  institutions  will  bring  diverse  knowledge  and  ideas  to  the \ndiscussions. Second, some countries in Asia have yet to establish their export-import banks \nand/or  ECAs.  ADB\u2019s  engagement  in  the  AEBF  enables  increased  participation  from  its \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs).  ADB  and  the  AEBF  encourage  Asian  countries  to \nestablish their export-import banks and/or ECAs and become observers and eventually AEBF \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 September 2015.  \n ", "2 \n \nmembers. Third, given the different level of development, export-import banks and ECAs are not \ncooperating with each other as much as they could. They have weak collaboration, partnerships, \nand  dialogues,  including  knowledge  sharing.  Lastly,  as  a  consequence  of  the  lack  of  full \ncooperation among Asian export-import banks and ECAs, their operations and processes are \nnot harmonized. ADB, through the proposed TA, supports the different levels of cooperation \namong Asian export-import banks and ECAs, including bilateral meetings. By helping address \nthese challenges, ADB also expects to benefit from supporting the AEBF. ADB could promote \nits  priorities  and  development  agenda  during  the  design  and  organization  for  the  training \nprograms.  Also,  in  attending  the  different  meetings,  ADB  could  explore  collaborating  and \npartnering with Asian export-import banks and ECAs.   \n \n6.  The earlier ADB TA supporting the AEBF ended in June 2015.2 Under the earlier TA, \nADB  hosted,  organized,  and  sponsored  participants  in  AEBF training  programs.  ADB  also \nprovided  resource  persons  including  speakers  and  facilitators  from  both  ADB  and  private \ninstitutions. Further, ADB attended annual meetings, TWG meetings, and training committee \nmeetings to discuss training programs, training committee chairpersonship, and updates on the \nAEBF including membership. ADB also presented its Strategy 2020,3 which is its response to \nthe global financial crisis, and annual updates on the Asian Development Outlook.4 During the \nannual meetings, ADB proposed bilateral meetings with the AEBF members to discuss potential \ncollaboration and partnership. The support for AEBF members and observers exposed staff \nfrom Asian export-import banks, ECAs, and other government institutions and agencies to the \nlatest developments and ideas that are high on ADB\u2019s own development agenda. \n \n7.  Since it started in November 2010, the earlier TA project\u2019s achievements include (i) \nexposure  of  Asian  export-import  banks,  ECAs,  and  government  institutions  to  ADB\u2019s  own \ndevelopment agenda; (ii) the Vietnam Development Bank becoming the 10th permanent AEBF \nmember; (iii) the number of observer countries increasing from one to 11 to include other ADB \nDMCs such as Bangladesh, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic,  Mongolia,  Myanmar,  Nepal,  Tajikistan,  and  Uzbekistan;  (iv)  a  reciprocal  risk \nparticipation agreement being signed among six AEBF members\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina  Eximbank  and  Korea  Eximbank,  India  Eximbank,  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, Australia\u2019s Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, and Indonesia Eximbank \npromoting intraregional trade; and (v) a conducive platform being provided for bilateral meetings \nbetween  ADB  and  the  Asian  export-import  banks  and  ECAs  to  discuss  partnership  and \ncofinancing  opportunities.  Asian  export-import  banks  and  ECAs  are  potential  cofinancing \npartners for ADB. During 2010\u20132014, cofinancing with the Korea Eximbank increased to almost \n$1.0 billion (with ADB financing of $1.6 billion), while cofinancing with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina Eximbank amounted to more than $75 million (with ADB financing of ADB $150 million). \nThrough the TA, ADB encouraged hosts of the training programs to offer topics that would \npromote wider participation and working together on common agendas. At the same time, ADB \nurged the participants of the training programs to review their current operations and processes \nrelevant to the topics, and explore how the respective operations and  procedures can be \nharmonized for efficiency and consistency.   \n                                                \n2  ADB. 2010.

The TA was approved by \nthe ADB Board of Directors on 22 November 2010 for $500,000 with the completion date of 31 October 2012. The \ncompletion date of 31 December 2014 was extended to 30 June 2015 to support two additional AEBF training \nprograms during the first half of 2015. \n3  ADB. 2008.

Finally, through the earlier TA, ADB has supported a total of 14 AEBF training programs \non topics including public finance, project and trade finance, public\u2013private partnership finance, \nprivate  and  finance  sector  development,  cofinancing  structuring,  loan  syndication,  risk \nmanagement, credit ratings, and securities and cross-border collaterals. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be increased capacities among staff in Asian export-import banks and \nECAs  and  other  AEBF  participants  including  government  agencies  from  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  for \nbusiness practices in corporate governance, environmental sustainability, risk management, \nregional cooperation and integration, and public\u2013private partnerships. The outcomes will be (i) \nstronger partnerships among Asian economies and Asian regional institutions; (ii) effective risk-\nsharing through reguarantee and coguarantee cooperation among Asian export-import banks \nand ECAs, giving them an additional level of comfort when doing business in challenging \nmarkets; (iii) regional expansion for the AEBF aiming at ADB\u2019s DMCs; (iv) knowledge sharing to \nincrease the efficiency and productivity of DMC development; and (v) further strengthening the \nbusiness practices of Asian export-import banks and ECAs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA outputs include client-oriented and high-quality AEBF training programs, support \nto the different activities of the AEBF, and cofinancing possibilities between the Asian export-\nimport banks and ADB. ADB will actively participate in the design and delivery of AEBF training \nprograms  and  workshops  through  the  use  of  experts,  resource  persons,  and  workshop \ncoordinators and facilitators. They will help implement these training programs and workshops. \nADB may also host training programs and workshops on request from AEBF members. \n \n11.  The TA will support AEBF training programs and workshops, annual meetings, TWG \nmeetings, training committee meetings, bilateral meetings, and other knowledge and capacity-\nbuilding programs for Asian export-import banks and ECAs. The proposed TA will enable ADB \nto continue supporting existing AEBF members and observers. The TA will also help AEBF \nexpand its regional scope by admitting new observers from Central and West Asia, the Pacific, \nand South Asia. \n \n12.  Forthcoming AEBF annual meetings will be held in Japan (2015), Indonesia (2016), and \nAustralia (2017). The training committee chairs are the Vietnam Development Bank (July 2015\u2013\nJune  2016)  and  the  Malaysia  Eximbank  (July  2016\u2013June  2017).  The  next  (31st)  training \nprogram of the AEBF on supply chain financing for the purpose of export promotion will be on \n13\u201314 October 2015 in Viet Nam. Future training programs include infrastructure financing in \nIndia, nonperforming loans and recovery management in Malaysia, and renewable energy in \nThailand. The TWG and training committee meetings will allow for discussions with ADB on \npossible topics for future training programs.  \n \n13.  The AEBF annual meetings provide opportunities for bilateral meetings between ADB \nand Asian export-import banks and ECAs to discuss potential collaboration and cofinancing \npossibilities. These discussions and partnerships enable ADB to undertake more cofinancing \nprojects and cooperation. \n \n ", "4 \n \n14.  Based on the outputs and activities above, major assumptions of the TA are sustained \ncommitment from AEBF member countries, observers, the host AEBF member country, and \nresource persons. One potential risk is regional political instability that may hinder country \nparticipation. The requested funding support under this TA will allow ADB to accommodate the \ntraining needs from the envisaged expansion of the AEBF\u2019s regional scope. While the AEBF \nwelcomes new observers, a potential risk may be the inability to identify eligible new observers \nby the host AEBF member country and governments without export-import banks and/or ECAs \nyet. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  Regional  Cooperation  and  Poverty  Reduction  Fund  and \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  breakdown  of  costs  includes  remuneration  for  two  national \nconsultants (total of $10,000), related expenses for resource persons including travel ($36,000), \nfinancial support to participants (i.e., travel, hotel accommodation, daily subsistence allowance, \nand miscellaneous travel expense of nominated participants from the eligible AEBF members \nand observers, and from potential new eligible AEBF observers), related expenses for ADB-\nhosted training programs, and contingencies. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will execute the TA, with the Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO)  as focal point, \nand with the host AEBF members and/or observers as the lead for the training programs.5 ADB \nwill  coordinate  with  AEBF  members  and  observers,  and  decide  on  training  topics  to  be \nsupported during the annual AEBF TWG and training committee meetings.  \n \n17.  ADB will help in the design and delivery of the programs and support arrangements for \nthe AEBF annual meetings, TWG and training committee meetings, and bilateral meetings with \nAEBF members and observers. The hosts and training committee chairs for the AEBF meetings \nand training programs are expected to decide on the overall themes, logistics, and protocol. \nADB will, from its perspective as a sponsor, elect to propose and support topics that are high on \nits own development agenda while catering for the needs of AEBF members and observers \nbased on new market developments.  \n \n18.  OCO will seek and engage a total of at least 12 potential resource persons for 50 \nworking-days  from  ADB  and  institutions  including  the  private  sector  to  present  and  run \nworkshops  during  the  trainings.6 This  will  be  achieved  through  early  discussions  with  the \npotential speakers on specific topics. ADB departments and offices will be invited to participate \nin the training programs ADB hosts at its headquarters. At the same time, OCO will seek and \nengage two national consultants (5 person-months each) for the two expected ADB-hosted \ntraining  programs  at  ADB  headquarters  in  Manila.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \n                                                \n5 OCO has been leading this TA for the following reasons: (i) ADB as a permanent observer was represented by \nOCO on the institutional level at AEBF annual, TWG, and training committee meetings; (ii) OCO retained the \nresponsibility for ADB's partnership with the ECAs; (iii) leading AEBF members, e.g., the Korean Eximbank and the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Eximbank, are active official ADB cofinancing partners; and (iv) the TA supports various \nsectors and topics, which can be fully facilitated by OCO. \n6 The travel cost of ADB staff will be covered by the TA in accordance with Budget, Personnel, and Management \nSystems Department and Strategy and Policy Department memorandum of 26 June 2013 (Use of Bank Resources: \nRegional technical assistance and TA versus Internal Administrative Expenses Budget). \n ", "  5 \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).    \n \n19.  ADB involvement in AEBF training programs will continue in 2015\u20132018. The TA is \nexpected to be implemented from October 2015 to October 2018. \n \n20.  With the TA, ADB\u2019s role has expanded and now includes designing, organizing, and \nhosting  meetings,  training  programs,  and  workshops.  Also,  ADB  is  asked  to  deliver \npresentations during the annual meetings on specific topics. ADB provides financial support to \nprompt  training  participation.  This  comprises  travel  expenses,  accommodation,  daily \nsubsistence  allowance,  and  miscellaneous  travel  expense  for  participants  from  DMCs  and \nobserver countries. In addition, ADB sponsors ADB and external resource persons to provide \nfaculty on specific areas. Disbursements will be made in accordance with the ADB Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  Activities supported by the TA will be regularly monitored by OCO and reported through \nback-to-office reports. OCO representatives will attend TWG and training committee meetings \nand annual meetings to make sure that proposed topics for the training programs are relevant to \nADB\u2019s development agenda.   \n \n22.  Participants from AEBF members and observers will directly benefit from the overall \ntheme  of  the  training  program  and  individual  presentations.  All  training  materials  will  be \ncompiled and disseminated to AEBF members and observers. AEBF training programs typically \nstart with an orientation session asking participants what their expectations are. End-of-training \nevaluation reports will not only measure whether participants\u2019 expectations have been met but \nalso survey how new knowledge, learning points, and practices are disseminated within their \nrespective institutions. \n \n23.  ADB will impress on participants that they should disseminate the major learning points \nand new knowledge, as well as course materials, within their institutions to ensure that they are \ninternalized and help Asian export-import banks and ECAs to harmonize the way they conduct \ntheir operations in accordance with best market practice. Such harmonization would make risk-\nsharing arrangements easier and efficient. In addition, ADB will encourage relatively new Asian \nexport-import  banks  and  ECAs  to  seek  guidance  and  bilateral  training  from  their  more \nexperienced peers. Overall, through its continuing training support, ADB will be able to witness \nnotable progress in the development of the relatively new members and observers toward the \nmore advanced standards employed by the front-running Asian export-import banks and ECAs. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Supporting the Asian EXIM Banks Forum, and hereby reports this action to the board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned With \nIncreased capacity of staff of Asian export-import banks and ECAs, and other participants of the AEBF \nincluding government agencies from ADB\u2019s DMCs for business practices in different areas including \ncorporate governance, environmental sustainability, risk management, regional cooperation and \nintegration, and public\u2013private partnerships. \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcomes       \n1.
