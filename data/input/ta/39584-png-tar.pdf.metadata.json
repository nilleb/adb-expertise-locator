The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) intends to participate in the development \nof  the  PNG  Gas  Project.  The  project  scope  includes  developing  new  gas  fields  in  Hides \n(Southern Highlands Province), converting existing oil fields to gas production, and developing a \nnew gas conditioning facility at Kutubu (in the same province), associated infrastructure, and a \n192-kilometer (km) onshore and 270 km offshore gas pipeline from the highlands up to the \nAustralian border. The project aims to produce around 616 million standard cubic feet per day \n(MMSCFD) of raw gas, treat and condition it, and then transport 529 MMSCFD, equivalent to \n215 petajoules per annum (PJ/a) of specification sales gas. During treatment and conditioning, \nabout 160 million barrels of gas condensates and some natural gas liquids will be recovered \nand blended into the crude oil stream of an existing oil project pipeline. In addition, about 150 \nmillion barrels of crude oil will be produced and processed. \n \n2.  The project is being proposed by a joint venture comprising ExxonMobil Corporation (as \noperator);  Oil  Search  Limited;  Nippon  Oil  Exploration;  and  Mineral  Resource  Development \nCompany Limited (MRDC), a PNG company representing landowner interests. The front-end \nengineering and design (FEED) work is substantially complete, but activities continue to adjust \npipeline alignment, enhance the project definition, and finalize various optimization and trade-off \nstudies. \n \n3.  On 5 September 2005, the Government formally requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to consider funding PNG\u2019s equity participation in the project. ADB confirmed that it would \nfavorably consider a major role in the transaction, with participation dependent on the outcome \nof preparatory activities. As the development schedule calls for project sanction by mid-2006, \nthere is limited time to plan and arrange the project financing. A fact-finding mission was fielded \non 24\u201327 October 2005, when ADB met with the Government and the project proponents. \nHaving requested a project preparatory technical assistance (TA) for ADB\u2019s involvement, the \nGovernment concurs with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  PNG  seeks  to  develop  its  substantial  natural  gas  resources,  identified  during  the \npetroleum exploration boom that ensued after PNG\u2019s first commercial oil discovery in 1986. \nSince mid-1992, the petroleum industry has contributed an average of 10% per annum to gross \ndomestic product (GDP) and 27% per annum to export earnings. However, in the absence of \nsignificant new oil discoveries in the depleted fields, only elevated global crude oil prices have \nmitigated the reduced contribution of oil production to the national economy. Oil production is \nlimited by the need to deal with increasing volumes of associated natural gas that are being \nproduced with the oil. If commercial evacuation of the gas were developed, oil production and \nrecovery efficiency would be enhanced and extended. PNG has, in order of magnitude, more \ngas reserves than oil reserves in energy terms, making it likely that gas development and \nproduction will continue for considerably longer than oil production to date. Development of \nPNG\u2019s gas resources is expected to have direct positive impact on the wider national economy. \nThe Government has recognized that it needs a large export-oriented gas development to drive \nthe initial full-scale gas field developments and establish gas transportation infrastructure upon \nwhich subsequent domestic gas development and use will depend. In due course, domestic \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 23 September 2005. \n ", "2   \navailability of gas may prompt commercial and industrial developments that may be of broad \neconomic and social benefit. \n \n5.  In June 2002, the proponents entered into a project gas agreement with the Government, \nwhich, among others, establishes the basic terms for Government participation, the project \nscope, and various other matters such as the applicability of the gas fiscal regime. The two \nsuccessive minor amendments to the agreement  related to the commitment to, schedule for, \nand timing of the FEED. A third amendment is pending negotiations among project sponsors. \n \n6.  The project proponents committed to proceeding to FEED in October 2004. Potential \ncustomers saw this as a tangible commitment by the sponsors to undertake the project. The \nproject is now considered economically and financially viable, with current indicative customer \ncommitments  of  around  215  PJ/a,  comprising  five  significant  foundation  load  customers. \nHowever, the risk remains that customers may renege on their commitments to purchase PNG \ngas, especially if the project schedule slips and the targeted date of mid-2009 for first gas \ndeliveries  is  missed.  Still,  should  the  project  come  to  fruition,  customers  would  increase, \npotentially raising gas demand to 300 PJ/a. \n \n7.  The project is estimated to require $2.2 billion to develop fields for gas production, \nestablish treatment and conditioning facilities, and construct pipelines. Ancillary to the project is \npipeline  construction  and  associated  compression  facilities  in  Australia,  costing some  $1.8 \nbillion. In accordance with its established petroleum regime, and obligations under the gas \nagreement, the Government intends to participate with a direct stake in the project by exercising \nits option in the agreement to buy an interest in the existing assets at the Hides gas field.2 This \nwould result in a net 11.2% interest in the overall project to PNG. The Government would \nrequire an estimated $328 million for its stake in the project. The economic and financial \nrationale for PNG\u2019s participation will have to be established.  \n \n8.  By 2030, project-related income taxes are estimated to comprise 4\u20135% of total public \nrevenue (around $100 million per annum). Other revenues have yet to be estimated and include \nroyalties, equity dividends, and other taxes. The Government\u2019s main fiscal policy challenges are \nensuring that revenues from these exhaustible resources are used in a way that protects the \ncompetitiveness of the non-energy sector and builds assets to ensure intergenerational equity. \nFrom the fiscal management perspective, attention should be paid to ensuring that revenue \ncalculation,  collection,  and  distribution  mechanisms  are  effective,  efficient,  equitable,  and \ntransparent. \n \n9.  PNG  has  well-defined  petroleum  laws  that  govern  the  conduct  of  private  sector \ninvestments  and  operations,  including  project-licensing  requirements.  PNG  also  has \nsophisticated  pipeline  laws3 that  provide  for  the  strategic  designation  of  pipelines  and  the \nsubmission by the licensees of arrangements for third-party access to optimize the use of \ninstalled infrastructure. The proper implementation of these provisions is vital to the use of gas \ninfrastructure for domestic gas utilization.4 \n \n                                                 \n2  This would cover the acquisition costs of equity in the Hides gas field and a pro rata share of project development \ncosts (including past costs), and include the capitalization of interest and funding of reserve accounts. \n3  ADB. 1995. Technical Assistance to the Papua New Guinea for the Petroleum Sector and Policy Framework Study. \nManila.  \n4  Following a request from the Government, ADB is considering the provision of policy advice for the planned \nKonebada Petroleum Park through the planned TA for policies for private sector development.  ", "  3\n10.  Almost all land (97%) is customarily owned by clan-based communities to whom it is all-\nimportant. There are no particularly dominant clans as there are more than 800 linguistic groups. \nPNG  claims  ownership  of  the  subsurface  mineral  and  petroleum  rights  by  virtue  of  its \nConstitution5 and  reestablishes  that  in  respect  of  oil  and  gas  in  the  Oil  and  Gas  Act. \nNotwithstanding such provisions, access to those resources may only be obtained through the \noccupation and use of customary land, for which there are strict laws requiring compensation. \nAside from compensation for direct impacts, PNG has progressively introduced significant and \nprogressive  benefit-sharing  arrangements  with  local  communities  comprising  customary \nlandowners and local and provincial governments. Initially, through the Government\u2019s policy \ndirection, but now through law, the Government has an array of benefit-sharing arrangements \ncomprising the transfer of royalties, grant of a 2% free equity interest in a project to landowners, \npayment of development levies to Governments, and other grants and programs. Oil, gas, and \nmineral  projects  have  different  types  of  benefit  sharing,  for  which  there  is  a  significant \nknowledge base in PNG about arrangements that are effective and those that are not. Lessons \nlearned need to be distilled and good practice applied.  \n \n11.  As  the  project  will  be  expanding  and  modifying  preexisting  petroleum  projects,  the \nGovernment has devised the Gas Project Co-operation and Sharing Agreement, through which \nit intends to facilitate the management of the benefits that the existing arrangements would yield \nfor each beneficiary landowner group. Specific arrangements have been made in respect of the \nHides  gas  field.  Landowners  are  to  be  granted  2%  free  equity,  while  the  National  Gas \nCorporation will be allocated 4% equity at cost, and the two provinces affected by the project\u2014 \nSouthern Highlands and Gulf\u2014will be allocated 1% equity at cost. These equity holdings will \nmost likely be managed by the Government-owned MRDC, which is responsible for managing \nsuch community project interests. Careful management of the benefit flows will be important to \nensure that each participant in the community receives a fair share in cash or kind. In the past, \nsome benefit flows were mismanaged and disproportionately distributed. \n \n12.  Project components that will likely impact on the environment are the expansion of \noperations at Hides and Kutubu, and gas pipeline construction and operation. The gas pipeline \npasses through various habitats, including alpine forest, limestone habitats, lowland forest, \nswamp, mangroves, coastal habitats, mudflats, and sea grass beds. The Kikori river basin, \nwhere  the  project  is  located,  has  been  identified  as  an  area  of  high  biodiversity  and \nconservation value, where unique plant and animal species occur. The project\u2019s environmental \nimpact has been minimized through maximum use of the existing project footprint and pipeline \nright-of-way. Nonetheless, the project facilities and pipeline may affect 700\u2013900 hectares of \nforest. Under the gas agreement, the project is required to construct about 153 km of certain \npublic roads in Kutubu and Kopi. This road component will be carefully reviewed to ensure \ncompliance with the ADB forest policy6 and to minimize impacts on biodiversity of the area. \nSince the  environment impact assessment (EIA) is being finalized by the proponent, the precise \nTA scope is not yet known. The TA will have to be flexible enough to accommodate changes in \nthe  scope  and  content  of  the  terms  of  reference.  The  EIA  will  include  an  environmental \nmanagement and monitoring plan to ensure policy compliance. It will be further refined during \ndetailed design.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Constitution, National Goals and Directive Principles, 4\u2014Natural Resource and Environment: \u201cWe declare our \nfourth goal to be for Papua New Guinea\u2019s natural resources and environment to be conserved and used for the \ncollective benefit of us all, and be replenished for the benefit of future generations.\u201d  \n6   ADB. 2003.

The TA objective is an agreed design for the PNG Gas Project, which will contribute to \nlocal and national economic and social development. Specifically, the TA will (i) be based on an \nacceptable feasibility analysis, and prepare documentation leading to the provision of an ADB \nloan, political risk insurance, and possibly a partial credit guarantee; (ii) review and prepare \nsafeguards\u2019  documents  related  to  the  environment,  indigenous  people,  and  involuntary \nresettlement; (iii) agree with the Government on arrangements for sound fiscal management of \nrevenues accruing to PNG from the project; and (iv) contribute to a review of economic and \nfinancial viability and sustainability. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will undertake due diligence on (i) environment assessment, (ii) involuntary \nresettlement and social issues, and (iii) fiscal and financial management issues. The TA will \nexplore the fundamentals of the project to ensure that any Government participation funded by \nADB will be robust and meet appropriate economic, social, and financial criteria, and comply \nwith the ADB safeguard policy. The TA will assess the suitability of PNG taking an equity stake \nin the project. The TA will involve substantial and extensive consultations with Government \nagencies, the communities, and the project companies. Major assumptions and/or risks include \nthe  quality  of  the  project\u2019s  due  diligence,  and  the  Government\u2019s  willingness  to  proactively \nengage in a policy dialogue on fiscal management. Consultants\u2019 outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 4. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  TA\u2019s  total  cost  is  estimated  at  $1,250,000  equivalent,  comprising  $871,500  in \nforeign exhange costs and $378,500 in local currency costs. ADB will provide $1,000,000 to \nfinance the TA on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance \nthe  remaining  $250,000  equivalent  to  cover  office  accommodation  and  support  services. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  Stakeholder  Government \nagencies include the departments of treasury, petroleum and energy, and environment and \nconservation, and the Internal Revenue Commission. \n \n17.  The TA will require the services of about 30.5 person-months of intermittent international \nand 18 person-months of domestic consultants with expertise in areas, including (but not limited \nto) social development, gender, environmental management, fiscal and financial management, \nand PNG-specific oil and gas sector issues.  \n \n18.  Because the project information is confidential, the scope of due-diligence  work is as yet \nuncertain and will depend on the quality of the FEED work soon to be submitted to ADB. Given \nthe tight deadlines for project sanction and preliminary terms of reference, consultants will be \nengaged as individuals following the quality-based selection QBS method in accordance with ", "  5\nIndividual Consultant Selection (ICS) process and the Guidelines of the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \n \n19.  The TA will begin in December 2005 and will be implemented over 11 months until \nOctober 2006. Support will be provided intermittently, the duration and frequency of which will \nbe based on identified needs and agreed with the consultants. Reporting requirements will be \nspecific to the focus of each assignment. Comprehensive policy dialogue with Government \nofficials, private sector stakeholders, and public consultation will be required. \n \n20.  The expected outputs will be disseminated in accordance with ADB\u2019s public disclosure \npolicy.7 Since  the  project  is  covered  by  a  confidentiality  agreement  with  its  sponsors,  all \ndocuments will be cleared with the project before disclosure. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Papua New Guinea for preparing the PNG Gas Project, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

PNG ranks 137, \nreflecting alarming economic and social intra-country disparities. On the UNDP poverty index, PNG ranks \n68 among developing countries. It ranks last among Pacific developing member countries on both \nindexes and clearly faces formidable tasks and challenges in achieving the MDGs.1  \n \nPoverty estimates have not been updated since the last household survey in 1996. However, the World \nBank2 has projected poverty levels using information on the rate and sector patterns of output and \nemployment growth. According to the projections, poverty has increased at an alarming rate in recent \nyears. The proportion of poor living under the national poverty line was estimated to be about 53.0% in \n2003, compared with 37.5% in the benchmark year of 1996. The proportion of the population living on \nless than $1 a day is estimated to have increased from 24.6% in 1996 to 39.1% in 2003. Many health \nindicators have deteriorated in recent years, including the availability and performance of health facilities. \nImmunization and infant mortality rates have deteriorated since 1990. The increase in reported HIV/AIDS \ncases is alarming.  PNG is the only Pacific island country considered to have a generalized epidemic of \nHIV.3 PNG has a population of 5.8 million people and, over the past 5 years, economic growth has barely \nkept pace with population growth. GDP increased by 2.6% in 2004, slightly down from 2.8% in 2003. \nMore than 80% of the population lives in rural areas with little access to basic social services. The literacy \nrate is 57%; and life expectancy is 55 years. Coupled with this is a high incidence of diseases, particularly \nHIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, pneumonia, malaria, and dengue. In some provinces, the infant mortality rate is \nmore than 100 for every 1,000 live births, and maternal mortality rate is 300 per 100,000 births.  \n \nThe development of new gas fields, road construction, and conversion of oil fields matches the priorities \nset forth by the Government in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy, which is structured around five \npillars: (i) strengthen governance, (ii) increase development of land and natural resource, (iii) improve and \nmaintain  physical  infrastructure,  (iv)  improve  and  expand  economic  growth  opportunities,  and  (v) \nstrengthen  and  expand  social  services.  The  project  will  help  achieve  these  goals  by  increasing \nexploration and sustainable use of natural resources; maintaining and improving the capacity of transport \ninfrastructure  networks;  improving  access  to  financial  services  and  facilitating  income-generating \nopportunities;  and  improving  the  delivery  of  social  services,  especially  in  health  and  education. \nSpecifically, the project is committed to employing PNG nationals to the maximum extent practical. \nPreference will be given to qualified individuals from communities in projected-affected areas. The project \nis committed to using qualified PNG businesses to supply goods and services to the maximum extent \npractical.  As  such,  the  project  will  bring  business  opportunities  and  financial  benefits  for  regional \ncommunities, including landowner groups. Ancillary benefits from the new Kokori\u2013Highlands road will \nbenefit isolated highland communities by facilitating access to markets and health and educational \nfacilities and to improved business opportunities. \n \nThe project will significantly boost mining and energy exports, which otherwise are expected to fall by \naround $400 million in real terms as oil production declines and major mining projects reach the end of \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 2005.

HIV epidemics are defined as follows: (i) generalized epidemic: HIV prevalence over 1% of the general \npopulation; (ii) concentrated epidemics among specific groups: HIV prevalence is over 5% in any subpopulation \nexhibiting high-risk behavior; and (iii) low-level or emerging epidemics: HIV prevalence below 1%. \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \ntheir operating lives. This is a key benefit of the project\u2014the potential to compensate for loss of economic \ncontribution from the petroleum and mining sectors as oil fields (Kutubu, Gobe, and Moran) are depleted, \nand major mining projects (such as Ok Tediand Porgera) face closure within the next decade.  \n \nThe project will provide a large number of jobs for PNG nationals. During the initial construction phase, up \nto 1,750 jobs will be created directly, around 80% for local workers. Once the project moves into the \noperational phase, 500\u2013600 full-time equivalent positions will be maintained directly by the production \noperations.  The  direct  project  benefits  will  include  valuable  revenue  streams  for  the  national  and \nprovincial governments (through taxes, levies, and other charges, and through equity participation in the \nproject\u2019s production and infrastructure components) and for local landowners (through royalty and levy \npayments, compensation, equity dividends and discretionary expenditure by the project proponents). \nPayments to landowners could improve quality of life and economic stability in the long run.  \n \nApart from the direct impacts on the Government and landowners in terms of revenue and jobs, the \nproject has the potential to kick-start the country\u2019s ailing petroleum exploration and production sector, \nproviding  a  focus  for  ongoing  involvement  by  major  international  players  that  would  help  attract \ninvestment and development. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                     Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nDuring project preparation, the project sponsor, together with the Government, conducted extensive \nsociocultural analysis. Three broad sets of social investigations have been identified and carried out \n(landowner  identification  and  social  mapping,  social  and  economic  impact  assessment,  survey  of \narchaeological and cultural sites). A poverty impact assessment and social analysis will be conducted \nduring the project preparatory TA. During TA implementation, consultants will determine any possible \ngaps that should be addressed and will delineate a plan to address poverty reduction methods and other \noutstanding issues.  \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?   Yes   No  \nAttention to social issues is central to project feasibility. PNG\u2019s resource development legislation pays \nspecific attention to the relationship between project developers,  government agencies, and customary \nlandowners. In achieving this, the project sponsor and the Government have (i) identified landowners and \nconducted social mapping, (ii) assessed social and economic impacts, and (iii) surveyed archaeological \nand cultural sites. For landowner identification and social mapping, the team gathered information through \nparticipant observation. Three parallel campaigns of 3\u20134 weeks each were undertaken for Hides\u2013Kutubu, \nGove environs, and Omati environs. For the social and economic impact assessment, the team assessed \nthe  PNG  Gas  Project  environmental  inception  report  and  surveyed  households  and  villages  in  90 \ncommunities in the project area. A rapid rural appraisal and a participatory rural appraisal (interviews of \nfocus groups) were conducted. Additional sector analysis was carried out via interviews. Field surveys of \narchaeological and cultural heritages were conducted in three delineated catchment areas: Huli Komo\u2013\nHides\u2013Moran, Kutubu\u2013Gobe, and Kikori\u2013Omati. Five to 10 sites representative of different ethnic groups \nwere inspected and informants interviewed about significant sites and places. \n \nThe project and government consulted communities in the Western Province and Torres Strait; PNG-\nbased  NGOs;  project  community  representatives  from  Hides,  Moran,  Kutubu,  and  Gulf;  National \nMuseums; National Fisheries Authority; timber industry representatives; and national and provincial \nrepresentatives.  \n \nDuring TA implementation, consultants will verify these activities and suggest additional stakeholder \nanalysis that might be necessary, such as addressing local NGOs and women\u2019s groups. The distribution \nof benefits (compensation and payments) from landowner to other family members will be studied and \nprovisions for equal distribution will be suggested. Should additional stakeholder analysis be needed, \nthese will be carried out during PPTA implementation. \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nIs there a participation strategy?   Yes    No \nDuring PPTA implementation, the social development/gender specialist and involuntary resettlement \nspecialist will examine stakeholder participation opportunities and delineate a participation strategy for the \nensuing loan. This will assure that a broad range of stakeholders are identified and consulted on issues, \ninvolving pros and cons of community-based, labor-intensive rehabilitation and maintenance, culturally \nsensitive modalities to increase jobs for women, and ensuring adequate attention to HIV/AIDS prevention \nand road safety, in the specific context of the project area.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nTraditional gender division of labor can be challenged by proactively ensuring women\u2019s involvement in \nroad maintenance and other jobs. During TA implementation, areas will be identified for additional \ninvolvement of women, including support services to construction camps. Women\u2019s effective access to \nthese jobs will require targeted programs of labor skill transfer. In light of women\u2019s traditional exclusion \nfrom construction jobs and benefits, the TA will recommend socioculturally sensitive modalities to ensure \nwomen\u2019s involvement in new work. Local NGOs that could be engaged will be identified during TA \nimplementation. As the newly built road will increase traffic between villages and as the temporary \nconstruction will invite a number of construction workers, the TA will recommend a plan to ensure \nHIV/AIDS awareness among women in the project area. \n \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No \nA gender strategy will be included in the resettlement plan and the indigenous peoples development plan. \n \nE.
