INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included in its Country Business Operational \nPlan (COBP) 2007\u20132009 for India a loan for the North Eastern Integrated Flood and Riverbank \nErosion Management Project (NEIFREMP) covering Arunachal Pradesh (AP) and Assam. The \nNEIFREMP  is  to  be  prepared  through  two  technical  assistance  (TA)  studies:  (i)  a  project \npreparatory TA for preparing the NEIFREMP (Assam), approved on 15 December 2006,1 and \n(ii) a component TA (CTA) for preparing the NEIFREMP (AP) under the TA Cluster (TAC) No. \n4814-IND: Project Processing and Capacity Development. A CTA fact finding mission was \nfielded from 23 January\u20139 February 2007, and held discussions with the representatives of the \nGovernment of India (the Government), Arunachal Pradesh state government (APSG), and \nstakeholders to reach an understanding on the objectives, scope, costs, and implementation \narrangements.2 Its design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Floods  and  Riverbank  Erosion  in  India.  India  is one of  the  most  disaster-prone \ncountries in the world. Floods and river erosion are major recurrent natural disasters, affecting \non average 7.6 million hectares (ha), and causing damage of an estimated $400 million annually \nbetween 1953 and 2003. The country has a flood-prone area of 46 million ha, which includes a \nquarter of its cultivable land. Vulnerability is high in the Ganges\u2013Brahmaputra\u2013Meghna river \nbasins in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, and North Eastern states, which have the lowest \nper capita incomes in India. The National Common Minimum Programme of 2004 has accorded \npriority to protection and development of these vulnerable low-income areas. \n \n3.  A comprehensive policy framework for flood control has been in place since 1954, and \nhas promoted short- to long-term programs for both structural and nonstructural measures. Over \nthe  years,  increasing  emphasis  has  been  placed  on  flood  management  recognizing  that \nabsolute physical control of floods and riverbank erosion is not feasible. The revised National \nWater  Policy  of  2002  further  emphasized  nonstructural  measures,  and  incorporated  an \nintegrated  approach  with  basinwide  watershed  management  and  stakeholder  participation. \nWithin  this  framework,  16  million  ha  of  riverine  land  have  been  protected  with  flood \nembankments and other structures. A nationwide flood forecasting and warning system has also \nbeen set up.  \n4.  North  Eastern  Region,  Brahmaputra  Basin  and  AP.  India\u2019s  Northeastern  region \nconsists of eight states covering about 26.2 million ha with a population of over 40 million. About \n75% of the region\u2019s geographical area, including 97% of AP and 90% of Assam, the two largest \nstates in the region, is located in the Brahmaputra River basin, mainly covered by mountainous \nand hilly terrains cut by narrow tributary river valleys in AP, and vast flat flood plains in Assam.4 \nIts one of the most significant problems, and the causes of significant flooding and riverbank \nerosion are the runoff from extremely heavy rainfall during the monsoon and high sediment \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the North Eastern Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion \nManagement Project (Assam).  Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 March 2007.   \n3  The component technical assistance is classified as general intervention for target classification; agriculture and \nnatural resources (water resources management) for sector (subsector) classification; sustainable economic \ngrowth (developing rural areas); capacity development (institutional development); and environmental sustainability \n(natural resources management) for theme (subtheme) classification.     \n4  The Brahmaputra River is 2,880 km long and drains an area of 580,000 km2, of which 51%, 8%, 34% and 8%, \nrespectively, are in the People\u2019s Republic of China, Bhutan, India, and Bangladesh. About 42% and 36% of its \ncatchment area in India is covered by Arunachal Pradesh and Assam, respectively.  \n ", "2   \nloads from upper watersheds, which are geologically young and unstable, and susceptible to \nlandslides and earthquakes. Watershed degradation due to shifting cultivation and deforestation \nis also widespread. The Brahmaputra is the fourth in the world in terms of maximum flood \ndischarges, while its sediment transport, amounting to 0.5 billion tons per year, is second only to \nthat of the Yellow River in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Some 0.3 million ha and 3.8 million \nha of land suffers from flood and bank erosion damages in the highest flood years in AP and \nAssam, respectively, accounting for 4% and 49% of the state geographical area, respectively.5  \n5.  AP is predominantly covered by mountainous and hilly terrains, and 81% of the total \narea is covered by forest. It has high social and cultural diversity with 64% of its population of \n1.2  million  belonging  to  scheduled  tribes.  Although  the  state  has  immense  potential  for \ndevelopment of hydropower, tourism, and other natural-resource based industries, it largely \nremains untapped. Its per capita income remains at 85% of the national average while poverty \nincidence (24%) is at par with that of the nation. The state\u2019s strategy for economic growth \nemphasizes improved intrastate and interstate connectivity, rural and agriculture growth, social \ndevelopment, and hydropower and tourism development, while preserving the social integrity \nand culture of the large tribal population.6 Effective flood and riverbank erosion management \n(FREM) in the state\u2019s scarce plain areas along the rivers is also essential, where key productive \nagriculture land, urban and township areas are located with population concentration.  \n6.  Floods and Riverbank Erosion in AP. Main challenges in AP include (i) riverbank \nerosion in floodplains and valley foot areas; (ii) river migration in the alluvial fans of tributaries \ndue to a rising riverbed, resulting in floodwater spillover onto adjacent lands causing land \ndegradation with heavy silt deposition; (iii) flashfloods in the tributary valleys caused by heavy \nlocal rains and failure of natural dams formed by landslides; and (iv) flooding in the flood plains \ncaused by high flows in the major tributaries.7 Annual reported damage in 1998\u20132004 amounts \nto $55 million. Efforts to address the problems were initiated relatively recently by the Water \nResources Department (WRD), and have focused on structural works in critical locations such \nas towns and productive agriculture lands. So far 40 schemes including 19 town protection \nworks have been implemented benefiting 54,000 ha of area, with revetments, spurs, and flood \nembankments. Nonstructural measures are yet to be operational, including centrally operated \nflood forecasting system for the Brahmaputra that reaches up to Assam only. Efforts are also \nmade for watershed management, yet there is little integration with FREM programs.  \n7.  Individual FREM schemes typically cost up to $2 million, of which the predominant share \nis for riverbank protection. Simple standard designs using gabions (wire-mesh cages filled with \nboulders)  have  been  developed  that  effectively  use  locally  available  materials  and  labor. \nHowever, they still require relatively high cost (up to $1 million per km of bank protection), and \nthe placement remains mostly ad hoc and reactive with little monitoring and maintenance, \nposing significant challenges in sustaining the impacts under highly unstable riverbed and \n                                                 \n5 The following papers provide additional information: (i) Verghese, B.G., Development Options in a Cooperative \nFramework, Natural Resources, Water and the Environment Nexus for Development and Growth in Northeast India, \nBackground Paper 1, World Bank.  http://www.cprindia.org/admin/paper/Water_Resources.pdf; (ii) Wiebe, H., River \nFlooding and Erosion in Northeast India Exploratory Considerations of Key Issues, Northwest Hydraulic Consultants, \nhttp://siteresources.worldbank.org/intsaregtopwatres/Resources/Background_Paper_1.pdf;  (iii)  Sharma,  U.C., \nIndigenous Techniques of Water Management for Resource Conservation and Sustainability: A Basis for Future \nGuidance,  Centre  for  Natural  Resource  Management,  Tarore,  Jammu,  India,  http://www.a-a-r-s.org/ws-\neowm/download/Plenary3/India.pdf;  and  (iv)  Sharma,  U.C.  and  Sharma,  V.,  Water  Resource  Development, \nManagement and Utilization in the Northeastern Region in India: Lessons from the Past and Future Strategies, \nhttp://www.wrrc.dpri.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~aphw/APHW2004/proceedings/WRD/56-WRD-A118/56-WRD-A118.pdf. \n6  Social cohesiveness is high, having customs of mobilizing community resources for collective development actions. \n7  Several towns in the hilly deposit areas are also affected by rapid soil erosion and deep gulley formation.  \n ", "  3\nchannel conditions in AP. Much sounder management systems for planning, implementation, \nmonitoring and maintenance are required, based on a firm understanding of the dynamic river \nprocesses, with flexibility for timely and adequate response. Substantial opportunities exist to \nenhance their cost-effectiveness through improved planning based on more rigorous surveys, \nexploration  of  lower  cost  designs,  and  higher  implementation  efficiency  with  transparency. \nSustainability should be ensured by exploring more durable structural designs, engaging local \ncommunities for implementation, and routine maintenance building on their social cohesiveness, \nstockpiling  of  materials,  and  doing  timely  additional  works  based  on  effective  monitoring. \nFinancing gaps and measures to bridge those gaps should also be explored. These FREM \nworks  need  to  be  combined  with  appropriate  nonstructural  measures  and  integrated  with \ncatchment management including soil conservation and forest management.  \n8.  Over the longer term, coping with flooding and riverbank erosion problems calls for a \nregional and basin-wide approach involving a balanced combination of short- to long-term \nstructural and nonstructural measures integrated with upper watershed management, given the \nintrinsic linkage between upstream catchment conditions and downstream flooding and bank \nerosion. From this perspective, the Government through the Brahmaputra Board is preparing \nregionally integrated master plans for the Brahmaputra basin while facilitating implementation by \nthe concerned central and state agencies. However, its effectiveness is deemed limited with \nscope for improvement in terms of adopting a more bottom-up consultative and decentralized \napproach. Integration with watershed programs also remains limited. Further efforts are needed \nto promote regional cooperation for FREM while addressing these constraints and facilitating \nstate-level dialogues for collaboration with the support of the Government.8  \n \n9.  Policy, Planning, and Institutional Basis. On the basis of the initial progress made, \nAPSG intends to develop a comprehensive framework and programs for FREM, following the \nrelevant  national  policies  and  recommendations.  The  main  recommendations  envisage  (i) \ndeveloping integrated and river basin-based FREM plans incorporating catchment management; \n(ii) extending strategically structural measures in the critical areas of the state\u2019s economic \ninterest; (iii) introducing non-structural measures including flood forecasting, warning systems, \nand flood zoning; and (iv) strengthening institutional capacity of WRD. In line with this initiative, \nAPSG  is  also  launching  water  sector  reforms  to  introduce  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement (IWRM) at the state level, with schedules for preparing a state water policy and \nplan, and establishing a state water apex body and river basin organizations.  \n \n10.    WRD remains a key organization within APSG to support the above FREM framework \nand programs as well as IWRM reforms. While it has a strong leadership and engineering skills \nto implement FREM infrastructure works, its institutional functions, structure, resources and \nmanagement systems need to be adjusted to support these developments. This should be \naddressed with (i) strengthening FREM management systems including data and knowledge \nbase and infrastructure maintenance; (ii) defining suitable state-level institutional arrangements \nfor IWRM and WRD\u2019s specific roles and functional arrangements; (iii) integrating community \nparticipation in FREM operations; and (iv) strengthening social and environmental safeguards \nmanagement. Likewise, effective collaboration arrangements to operationalize holistic FREM \nintegrated with catchment management should be defined, building on the existing setup of \nemergency disaster management and in line with emerging IWRM institutional arrangements.    \n \n                                                 \n8  Significant  scope  exists  to  strengthen  and  exchange  data  and  knowledge  on  basin-wide  hydrology  and \ngeomorphology that could provide systematic analytical basis to support the state level flood and riverbank erosion \nmanagement  operations.  \n ", "4   \n11.  Within this backdrop, the APSG submitted a project proposal to establish and implement \na comprehensive FREM framework and programs at the state level for possible ADB financing. \nIt includes a prioritized list of short-term FREM infrastructure, a range of non-structural FREM \nmeasures, and associated strengthening of policy, planning, and institutional capacity. Building \non  the  proposal,  an  investment  project  needs  to  be  prepared  that  is  ready  for  prompt \nimplementation and can result in substantial reduction of annual flood and riverbank erosion \ndamages. The TA will support this process by assessing the most effective way of addressing \nthe aforementioned issues. It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Water Policy as well as the COBP for \nIndia 2007\u20132009 which aims, among other objectives, to upgrade infrastructure and facilitate \nrural development for broad-based economic growth and employment creation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The CTA impact is enhanced readiness for implementing a project to reduce flood \ndamage and loss of land by riverbank erosion and river migration through comprehensive, cost-\neffective,  sustainable  and  adaptive  structural  and  nonstructural  measures,  their  improved \nmanagement  systems,  and  associated  institutional  capacities  including  participatory \nmechanisms. The CTA outcome is the design of the AP components of a sector-type project \ncovering both AP and Assam agreed upon by the Government, APSG, and ADB. The ensuing \nproject will possibly use a multi-tranche financing facility (MFF).9      \n13.  To meet the MFF criteria, the CTA outputs will comprise (i) an institutional development \nroadmap to operationalize the relevant policy principles including comprehensive FREM and \nIWRM and sustainable infrastructure maintenance, and a sound investment program with a list \nof proposed subprojects; (ii) appraised sample subprojects to provide comprehensive FREM \nand associated programs with baseline surveys, stakeholder analysis, and assessment of cost-\neffective, affordable, and sustainable infrastructure; (iii) a design for non-structural programs at \nstate  and  subproject  levels;  (iv)  institutional  arrangements  to  facilitate  timely  and  effective \nplanning and implementation of FREM programs to cope with dynamic natural river processes; \nand (v) support programs to implement the Project with necessary institutional strengthening.10 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The CTA will prepare its outputs with utilization of available technical capacities and draft \ndetailed project proposals (DPRs) of WRD, and data and analytical outputs of the Government \nsuch  as  the  Brahmaputra  Board.  Complementary  support  is  provided  through  consulting \nservices to (i) explore more cost-effective and sustainable FREM options, and (ii) undertake \nnecessary non-engineering tasks for subproject planning and associated policy and institutional \nstudies. A consultative approach will be taken through seminars and workshops, and a series of \nfield-level planning, option selection, and design meetings with beneficiaries. Close coordination \nwill also be maintained with the separate TA to prepare investment components for Assam with \nmutually  consistent  TA  work  plans,  exchange  of  draft  outputs,  and  joint  workshops.  The \nactivities are broadly divided into two components to prepare the aforementioned outputs.  \n                                                 \n9  It may comprise (i) participatory scheme planning; (ii) range of FREM infrastructure and nonstructural measures; \n(iii) complementary support to enhance growth and poverty impacts; and (iv) institutional strengthening and project \nmanagement including strengthening of the policy and planning framework for FREM and IWRM. \n10  About 6\u201310 sample subprojects will be appraised and the selection criteria for the remaining subprojects will be \nidentified  under  the  TA.  A  process-type  approach  will  be  justified  based  on  conducive  policy  framework, \ninstitutional strengthening and investment plan, and exclusion of subprojects having major safeguards implications.   \n ", "  5\n15.  Preparing FREM Strategy and Action Plan, Institutional Development Roadmap, \nand Investment Programming. This component will (i) undertake FREM sector review for AP \nincluding the performance of ongoing interventions, and policy, strategy, and investment priority \nand plans; and (ii) prepare a FREM strategy and action agendas to bridge any gaps with the \nrequired framework including all the agendas as defined in the issues section above. Based on \ntheir discussion at the state workshop, the CTA will (i) undertake detailed institutional analyses \nto address those agendas which will culminate in an institutional development action plan and \nroadmap, and (ii) prepare FREM sector investment programs for AP with necessary scoping of \nthe required investments and assessment of the required resources.  \n16.  Sample Subproject Selection and Feasibility Studies. Implemented in parallel to the \nabove, this component will (i) select sample subprojects while preparing selection criteria and \nfully exploring lower cost and more durable FREM infrastructure design options; (ii) undertake \nbaseline surveys, stakeholder analysis, option finalization, feasibility studies and subproject \nplanning  in  close  consultation  with  the  beneficiaries;  (iii)  assess  social  and  environmental \nsafeguards and prepare required action plans; and (iv) formulate a social development strategy \nand programs (the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2). Appropriate institutional \narrangements for Project implementation will be defined including capacity strengthening. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the CTA is estimated at $875,000 equivalent. It will be financed by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom for $700,000 equivalent on a grant basis which will be \nadministered  by  ADB.  The  APSG  will  finance  the  remaining  $175,000  equivalent  through \nprovision of office space, counterpart staff, surveys, data and analyses including DPRs. Specific \ncost estimates and a financing plan are shown in Appendix 3. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the CTA does not commit ADB to finance the ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Department of Economic Affairs is the overall EA for the TAC, whereas AP WRD \nwill be the CTA implementing agency, and Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region \n(MDONER) will be the coordinating agency for preparing NEIFREMP for the two states. WRD \nwill appoint a TA director at the level of senior superintending engineer. APSG will form (i) a \nsecretary level TA steering committee (SC) chaired by Chief Secretary,11 and (ii) a project \npreparatory working group (PPWG) including WRD staff (in planning, survey, quality control, \nand monitoring) and those nominated by other line departments participating in the SC. The TA \nwill also seek the advice of the concerned Government agencies at key stages.12 A highly \nparticipatory approach will be followed at the field level.  \n19.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  for  six  months  from  October  2007  to  March  2008. \nConsulting services will be provided which will comprise a team of international and national \nconsultants, and an international river engineering advisor. The team will comprise 10.5 person-\nmonths (pm) of international consultants and 36 pm of national consultants. Outline terms of \nreference are shown in Appendix 4. The team will be engaged by ADB through an international \nfirm in association with national consultants through quality and cost based selection based on \nsimplified technical proposal procedure, whereas an international river engineering advisor will \nbe engaged individually by ADB to provide 1 pm of inputs to externally advise on the FREM \ninfrastructure options explored and finalized under the CTA. All consultants will be recruited \n                                                 \n11  Including planning, finance, disaster management, land, rural development, forestry, and agriculture.  \n12  Including Brahmaputra Board, Central Water Commission, Ministry of Water Resources, and MDONER.   \n ", "6   \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging national consultants.  \n20.  The consultant team will prepare inception, draft FREM sector review and strategy \nreports, draft finals, and final reports within 3 weeks, 1.5 months, 5 months, and 6 months of \nfielding, respectively. To facilitate the effective preparation of the NEIFREMP covering AP and \nAssam while facilitating dialogues for possible regional cooperation, the following workshops will \nbe organized, possibly as joint events of APSG, Assam state government, and the Government, \nand with a range of stakeholders including the non-government organizations: (i) inception \nworkshop in month 1, (ii) second workshop to discuss the draft sector review and strategy report \nin month 2, and (ii) third workshop to present the draft  final report in month 6. ADB will \nintensively monitor and supervise the TA by fielding inception and three review missions.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Sources/ Reporting \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions  \nEnhanced readiness of  \u2022 Reduced flood damage and  \u2022 The Government and  \u2022 The APSG will accept the \nimplementing a project to  loss of land by riverbank  APSG statistics   terms and conditions offered \nreduce flood damage and  erosion and river migration  \u2022 Baseline and periodic  by the Government for the \nloss of land by riverbank  (to be quantified in the CTA)  monitoring reports   follow-on investment project. \nerosion and river migration  \u2022 Institutional strategy and  \u2022 Other mechanisms to  \u2022 The recommended structural \nthrough comprehensive, cost  actions strengthened for  be determined during  and nonstructural measures \neffective, sustainable, and  effective FREM and IWRM  the CTA  for FREM are implemented as \nadaptive structural and  \u2022 Sound institutional    designed with verification of \nnonstructural measures in the  arrangements set up for  the technical robustness. \ntributaries of the Brahmaputra  FREM management systems   \nRiver in AP through  \u2022 Sustained maintenance  Risk \nintegrated FREM  funding of FREM  \u2022 Morphological and other risk \ninfrastructure established  factors such as abnormal \n\u2022 Institutional actions  taken to  floods and earthquakes are \noperationalize IWRM  beyond the anticipated level \nincluding state water policy  reflected in the design.  \nand water plan formulation \n\u2022 Above targets achieved \nwithin the time frame of the \nensuing loan project  \nOutcome      Assumptions \nAn MFF project proposal  \u2022 Agreement reached on  \u2022 APSG and Government  \u2022 The APSG and beneficiaries \nsuitable for ADB financing  FREM strategy and action  confirm the AM of the  will support the selection of \nthat would  agendas within 2 months of  review mission to  sample subprojects, \nthe start the CTA  finalize action agendas.  alternative design options, and \n(i) reduce flood damage and \n    feasibility study findings. \nriverbank erosion through \n\u2022 Agreement reached on the  \u2022 The APSG and   \u2022 All stakeholders will accept the \ncomprehensive, cost-\nproposal elaborating the  Government confirm the  action plan to put into \neffective, sustainable, and \nproject design \u2013 objective,  AM of the final tripartite  operation effective FREM and \nadaptive structural and non-\nscope, implementation  review mission and  sustainable maintenance \nstructural works with \narrangements, and financing  endorse CTA final  funding mechanisms. \nstakeholder participation; and  \nplan  within 6 months of the  report.  \u2022 Effectiveness of the identified \n(ii) strengthen the policy and  start of the CTA    FREM design options is \ninstitutional bases for      verified through pilot testing. \neffective FREM, such as (a)  \u2022 Agreement reached on the  \u2022 The APSG and the  \u2022 The APSG will, where impacts \nWRD in planning and  institutional roadmap and  Government confirm the  are unavoidable, accept ADB\u2019s \nproviding programs with  investment programs toward  AM of the separate TA  safeguard requirements on \nstakeholder participation and  effective FREM operation  design to enhance  resettlement, environment, \ninteragency coordination; and  with IWRM perspective within  implementation  and indigenous peoples. \n(b) statewide policy, planning,  6 months of the start of the  readiness of the  \u2022 Beneficiaries will show \nand coordination framework  CTA    ensuing project  willingness to sustain the \nfrom an IWRM perspective.  adopted FREM options and \nenhance economic activities. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Arunachal Pradesh (AP):  \nWhile the process of development in Arunachal Pradesh (AP) is recent, the state of development is encouraging. \nIncome per head has increased and the rate of growth of income is high compared to the national average. The \nliteracy rate has increased from 25% in 1981 to 54% in 2001. Along with growth of literacy and income, the health \nstatus has also improved. Nevertheless, overall the North East has higher incidence of poverty with Assam among the \nstates with lowest per capita income. The Human Poverty Index (HPI)1 for AP is estimated at 39.47% as compared to \nthe national HPI of 33%. According to the 2001 Census, the Scheduled Tribes (ST) population constitutes about 65% \nof the total population of 1,098,000 people, the rest belonging to the General category. AP is also characterized by \nlinguistic diversity and as many as 42 languages are spoken there. The people have an innate knowledge of the \nenvironment and the cultural practices passed down from generation to generation have helped to protect the rich \nbiodiversity of the State. Social cohesion and a strong sense of community spirit still persist. \nOver 90% of AP consists of mountainous and hilly terrain cut by narrow tributary river valleys. A third of the net state \ndomestic product comes from the primary sector, agriculture. Except for a few tribes with land in river valleys where \npaddy cultivation is done on mostly rain fed terraced land during the monsoon season, most agricultural production is \nbased on shifting cultivation or jhum for subsistence purposes only. Poverty ratio is higher in rural areas (27%) \nwhereas it is 12% in urban areas. The state\u2019s strategy for economic growth emphasizes improved intrastate and \ninterstate connectivity, rural and agricultural growth, social development, and hydropower and tourism development, \nwhile preserving the social integrity and culture of the tribal population.  \nEffective flood and riverbank erosion management (FREM) in the state\u2019s scarce plain areas along the river is \nessential, where productive agricultural land and urban and township areas are located with population concentration. \nCauses of significant flooding and river erosion are the runoff from extremely heavy rainfalls during monsoon which \nmay coincide with floods in the main stem rivers and high loads of silt from the upper watersheds in the Himalayas, \nTibet, where the Brahmaputra originates. Sudden breaching of temporary dams formed by landslides in the upper \nreaches of the tributaries also contributes to sudden devastating flash floods. There is no operational flood warning, \nsystem operational. Watershed degradation due to shifting cultivation and deforestation is widespread.  \nThe economic costs and social disruption associated with flooding have been rising. This is in part due to increasing \nhuman occupation and associated economic activity in the scarce floodplains. In-migration, an inflow of population into \nthe State is indicated by rising figures of the \u201cgeneral\u201d population as compared to the tribal population settling in the \nrisky flood plains for agricultural production purposes much in the same way as they do in the floodplains of the \nBrahmaputra and on char (sandbar) islands. The inflow of migrant labor led to the introduction of new technology in \nagriculture. Migrant workers brought with them the knowledge of wet rice cultivation and this has meant the extension \nof permanent cultivation in many river valleys and plateaus. Only a few tribes such as the Apatani, the Singpho, and \nthe Kamptis of Lohit district practice permanent cultivation or cultivated paddy on terraced land as opposed to jhum \nshifting cultivation. It is believed that these migrant workers are an important segment of the peasantry extending the \npermanent cultivation of land which earlier remained uncultivated. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nParticipatory social and economic analysis is required to analyze specific segments of disadvantaged groups, \nincluding tribal people, sharecropping tenants from other states, and women in the project area; and to develop \nspecific strategies to meet their development needs and priorities. As AP is a special category state, the role of \ndevelopment processes, and the involvement of the Government and local community participation practices will be \nexamined to determine sensitive, non-disruptive, social, and cultural sensitive implementation modalities. \nKey questions of the development process in AP will be land tenure and land ownership of the tribal population and \nthe changing pattern in the gender division of labor. While the challenge for the tribal population will be land titling \nunder a communal land holding system, the challenge for women and particularly tribal women will be to secure land \nownership. The social analysis will also look into the communal land holding structure and to what extent the project \nwill affect traditional land holding patterns. Most project activities will be undertaken on riverbanks which are regarded \nas communal land where access is guided by usufruct land rights. \n \n                                                 \n1 The Human Poverty Index measures deprivation in health, education, and economic provision as outlined in \nUNDP\u2019s Human Development Report of 2002. \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nThe technical assistance (TA) will undertake a stakeholder analysis and suggest a participation strategy based on the \nrealities and the special development needs of AP, taking into account the special political and economic situation of \nthe state and the rights of the tribal population to land and participation in project activities. It is believed that through \nactive participation of community groups, drawing on strong community spirit, ownership of and support for the project \nwill be strong. How to best involve community action in flood and erosion control for structural and non-structural \nmeasures will be explored in detail, taking into account that structural measures such as river embankments, \nrevetments, and spurs require regular maintenance and need complementary non-structural measures to be made \nmore effective. \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe challenge for women and particularly tribal women in the development process ahead of them will be to secure \nland ownership. A result of increasing population density and intensification of agriculture, shifting cultivation systems \nwith  collective  ownership  over  land  are  usually  transformed  into  a  system  of  peasant  production  of  private \nlandownership using animals for land cultivation and transport. These changes may have significant impact on the \nposition of women, as private landownership may lead to the transfer of land to males and marginalization of women \nin production activities which in turn leads to their marginalization in society and the household. Although there is no \nmatriarchy in AP, women hold a high and respectable position. They work on equal terms with the men in jhum and \nmake their influence felt in the tribal councils. \nThe TA will develop a gender action plan to ensure that women, particularly tribal women will participate and equally \nbenefit from project activities. It will also analyze the changes in the communal land holding structure and to what \nextents the project will affect traditional land holding patterns and mitigation measures will target women.  \nHas an output been prepared?

The rules and institutional \nmechanisms that govern access to land vary from tribe to \ntribe and place to place. Riverbanks are being used by \nfarmers  for  agricultural  purposes  under  usufructuary \nrights.
