INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) aims to strengthen the institutional capacity of policymakers and technical experts in the \narea of sovereign asset and liability management (ALM) by deepening the technical skills for \nanalyzing the interlinkages between public debt and reserve management. While public debt \nmanagement (PDM) and reserve management are often viewed in isolation, there is significant \nmerit in taking a holistic ALM perspective to optimize public sector financial management and \nreduce risks such as currency or maturity mismatches. ADB\u2019s Treasury Department is uniquely \nplaced  to  conduct  this  TA  because  it  gained  significant  experience  in  PDM  and  reserve \nmanagement and developed an extensive network of contacts with decision-makers in finance \nministries and central banks under two ongoing TA projects, the Asian Regional Public Debt \nManagement  Forums  and  Workshops,  and  the  Asian  Regional  Forum  on  Investment \nManagement of Foreign Exchange Reserves.1 While the earlier TA work focuses on knowledge \nexchange through forums, ADB\u2019s Treasury Department proposes this TA to provide in-country \nassistance on sovereign ALM. It is meant to complement the PDM and reserve management \ninitiatives of ADB\u2019s regional departments, and the Treasury Department will coordinate the TA \nactivities with these departments.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Effective and sound PDM is a cornerstone of robust economic policy. PDM is defined as \nthe process of establishing and implementing a strategy for managing a government\u2019s debt to \nmeet its financing needs, taking into account its cost and risk objectives. Effective and sound PDM \nis typically characterized by the following elements:2 \n \n(i)  The core strategy. A medium-term, annually updated PDM strategy with links to \nmacroeconomic  policy  is  in  place  and  covers aspects  such  as  the  currency \ncomposition  of  public  debt,  the  mix  of  domestic  and  external  debt,  maturity \nstructure and minimum liquidity targets, the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate \nborrowings, and an analysis of borrowing strategies in a cost-risk framework.  \n(ii)  Sound governance and institutional framework. A sound legal and institutional \nframework  assigns  responsibilities  for  implementing  the  PDM  strategy  and \nprovides accountability and transparency. Office arrangements such as back office, \nmiddle office, and front office are in place.  \n(iii)  Effective  risk  management  strategy.  A  risk  management  framework  for \nmonitoring, scenario modeling, performance benchmarks, and limits is in place. \n(iv)  Integrated  information  technology  infrastructure.  A  debt  recording  and \nmanagement system that allows the management of public debt is in place.3 \n \n3.  Reserve management, which is the preserve of central banks, is key to ensuring that  \nadequate official public sector foreign assets are available to meet a defined range of objectives. \nFor instance, such objectives call for limiting a country\u2019s external vulnerability by maintaining \n \n1 ADB.  2015.

Washington, DC: World Bank. \n3  The two most commonly used systems are the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System by the United \nNations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the Commonwealth Secretariat\u2019s Debt Management \nand Recording System.  \n \n ", "2 \nforeign currency liquidity to absorb economic shocks and provide assurance to capital markets \nthat  the  country  can  meet  its  foreign  exchange  needs.  Sound  reserve  management  is \ncharacterized by the following elements:4 \n \n(i)  Reserve management strategy and policy. Strategy and policy spell out the \nobjectives of holding reserves, and include investment objectives, risk\u2013return \nconsiderations,  eligible  asset  classes,  liquidity  tranching,  and  internal  versus \nexternal management. \n(ii)  Internal governance and organizational structure. A legislative framework is in \nplace, and the reserve management department has an institutional structure with \nfront,  middle,  and  back  offices;  clearly  delineated  areas  of  responsibilities; \nsupervisory bodies such as investment and risk committees; and regular internal \naudits.  \n(iii)  Risk management framework. A well-defined framework identifies risks, such \nas liquidity, market, credit, and operational risks; and establishes the parameters \nwithin which these risks shall be managed.  \n(iv)  Systems support. This enables effective and efficient investment management \nand best-practice risk management, and provides regular management reports \nthat allow stakeholders to receive up-to-date and comprehensive information.                               \n \n4.  While PDM and reserve management are often viewed in isolation, modern approaches \nrecognize that both need to be seen in a holistic, sovereign ALM context. Viewing PDM without \nincluding sovereign assets, for example, runs the risk of not recognizing potentials for risk \nreduction through natural hedging on the sovereign balance sheet. In practice, since the two areas \nare typically handled by two different branches of the government (reserve management by the \ncentral bank and PDM by the finance ministry), they often reveal institutional gaps, insufficient \ncoordination, and the lack of an agreed framework or even basic principles on how these issues \nshould be coordinated.  \n \n5.  This TA will focus on providing an integrated view of sovereign ALM issues, connecting \nsovereign financial assets with sovereign liabilities and analyzing optimization and risk hedging \nof the sovereign balance sheet from an ALM perspective. Sovereign ALM is a relatively new area \nin the developing member country (DMC) context. ADB has been organizing debt management \nforums since 2009 and reserve management forums since 2011. As part of these, ADB carried \nout surveys of existing practices of PDM, reserve management, and sovereign ALM. These \nsurveys found that sovereign ALM is not widely practiced in most of ADB\u2019s DMCs.  \n  \n6.  Other development organizations do not cover the area of sovereign ALM and focus \nmostly on PDM. Leading in the area of PDM is the World Bank Treasury, which established the \nGovernment Debt and Risk Management Program in 2011. Funded by the Swiss State Secretariat \nof Economic Affairs, the program provides customized technical advisory services to strengthen \npublic debt and risk management capacity but is aimed exclusively at middle-income countries. \nOnly three countries from the Asia and Pacific region are currently participating in this program.5 \nSince 2008, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) jointly manage the Debt \nManagement  Facility,  which  traditionally  focused  on  lower-income  countries.  The  facility \nconcentrates on debt management issues but does not include sovereign ALM. In the area of \n \n4  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2014.

The April 2019 implementation report for phase 1 of the program: \nhttps://treasury.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/treasury/client-services/government-debt-risk-management-program \n \n ", "3 \nreserve management, the two main sources of technical assistance are the Bank for International \nSettlements and the World Bank\u2019s Reserves Advisory and Management Program (RAMP).6 \nHowever, in order to be eligible to participate for the advisory and capacity-building components, \na DMC is required to deposit a minimum amount of liquidity for asset management purposes.7 In \nthe area of sovereign ALM, the donor community has launched two initiatives. First, the Dept \nManagement  Department  of  the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development \n(UNCTAD)  conducted  a  TA  project  on  sovereign  ALM  that  included  country  and  regional \nworkshops but was limited to Africa and Latin America.8 Second, the World Bank developed a \ntraining program that looks at sovereign balance sheet management. The program is comparable \nto the TA but is fee-based and targeted at middle-income countries that are willing to pay for the \nadvisory services. ADB and World Bank Treasury staff discussed the topic of sovereign ALM and \nagreed on close coordination to avoid duplications, ensure complementarity, share lessons, and \noptimize knowledge transfer.  \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with a key operational priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 20309\u2014strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity10\u2014which highlights that good governance and strong \ninstitutional capacity are the basis for country development. Strategy 2030 notes that ADB will \nhelp strengthen the quality and capacity of public institutions to undertake policy reforms. The TA \nfalls directly into this focal area of Strategy 2030.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA will have the following impact: enhanced institutional sovereign ALM capacity. It \nwill have the following outcome: more resilient debt and reserve management and improved \nmacroeconomic management. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA activities will include  \n(i)  country diagnostic assessments to benchmark PDM and reserve management in \nthe context of a sovereign ALM approach against international best practices;  \n(ii)  in-depth analysis, recommendations, and an implementation time plan to enhance \nexisting standards and practices; and  \n(iii)  assistance in implementing the recommendations.  \n \nADB benefits from these activities through client feedback on how to enhance its financial \nproducts and strengthen its relevance in the region.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s Treasury Department will cooperate with regional departments to identify the \nparticipating DMCs. The objective is to achieve broad geographic representation. It is expected \n \n6  More information on the RAMP is provided under this link: \nhttps://treasury.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/treasury/client-services/reserves-advisory-and-management-\npartnership (accessed 13 November 2019). \n7  RAMP requires a $100 million minimum to be placed with the World Bank Treasury for asset management purposes.  \n8 Sovereign  asset  and  liability  management:  https://unctad.org/en/Pages/GDS/Sovereign-Debt-Portal/Sovereign-\nAsset-and-Liability-Management.aspx (accessed 12 November 2019). \n9 ADB. 2019.

DMCs need to commit staff resources for the assistance \nto succeed. Each DMC will be responsible for indicating its development priorities, agree to a \nsequencing of reforms, and spearhead the implementation of the reforms. \n \n11.  Output 1: Completion of assessments related to PDM, reserve management in a \nsovereign ALM context. The diagnostic assessment of PDM will follow the World Bank\u2019s debt \nmanagement performance assessment methodology, a system for reviewing indicators crucial to \neffective PDM and sovereign ALM. In the area of reserve management, the IMF\u2019s 2014 Revised \nGuidelines on Reserve Management shall form the basis for the country diagnostic assessment. \nThe  guidelines  identify areas  of  agreement  between  practitioners  on  reserve management \nprinciples and best practices. No generally accepted framework on sovereign ALM exists, but \nrecent work from the IMF and other debt management offices has laid out principles in this area11 \nthat will form the basis of the country diagnostic assessments. The studies under this output \nshould pinpoint opportunities to strengthen both public debt and reserve management and \nhighlight their interdependencies in the context of sovereign ALM. They should include a set of \npolicy recommendations and an action plan with a timeline.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Completion of a synthesis report on the implementation of the TA. A \nsynthesis report should be prepared that reports on the progress made across the participating \nDMCs.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Accomplishment of technical capacity building in sovereign asset and \nliability  management.  On  request  by  the  participating  DMCs,  the  TA  team  will  organize \nworkshops to facilitate knowledge exchange. These events will target staff involved in reserve \nmanagement and PDM. By organizing these workshops jointly with central banks and finance \nministries,  institutional  gaps  can  be  bridged  to  achieve  a  more  symbiotic  sovereign  ALM \napproach. Experts from pertinent organizations\u2014e.g., the World Bank, the IMF, the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development, PDM system providers, academia, members from \nDMCs\u2019 parliamentary budget committees, and rating agencies\u2014will be invited to participate in the \ndiscussions. Workshops may be organized with other development partners to tap into their \nexperience and may include peer-to-peer learning from speakers from other DMCs that are willing \nto share knowledge. Workshops will also include training and capacity building on ADB\u2019s Debt \nManagement Products that can be instrumental in implementing a sovereign\u2019s asset-liability \nmanagement strategy.12  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \nADB will be the executing and implementing agency, and ADB\u2019s Treasury Department will \nadminister the TA and supervise the TA consultants. The TA will be implemented in consultation \nwith ADB\u2019s regional departments, Strategy and Policy Department, Economic Research and \nRegional Cooperation Department, Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department, \nand other relevant departments and ADB\u2019s finance sector group, and will follow the \u201cOne ADB\u201d \napproach. \n \n \n11 For example: https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2014/061014.pdf and \nhttps://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/gdsddf2014misc1_en.pdf \n12 Such Debt Management Products were introduced by ADB in 2006 and include the option to undertake currency and \ninterest rate management transactions with respect to a sovereign\u2019s third-party liabilities.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2022. It will include at \nleast five country diagnostic assessments and a synthesis report on optimizing sovereign ALM. A \nno-objection letter will be obtained prior to the commencement or financing of any undertaking in \nthe territory of any DMC participating in this TA. The TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).

ADB will engage the consultants following its Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and its project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.13  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nKnowledge and Support in Sovereign Asset and Liability Management, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n \n13 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Technical Assistance is aligned with: enhanced institutional sovereign ALM capacity \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome        \nA more resilient debt  By December 2022, countries  Technical assistance (TA)  Occurrence of a global \nand reserve  should have made tangible  progress reports, country  and/or regional financial \nmanagement and  progress in the key areas that  diagnostic reports, and  crisis weakens the \nimproved  were identified during the  country synthesis reports.   commitment of DMCs to \nmacroeconomic  diagnostic studies.
