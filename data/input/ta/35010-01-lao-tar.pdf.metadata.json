The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) asked the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to support environmental compliance\nand implementation of environmental policy and regulations. A Fact-Finding Mission visited the\nLao PDR and held discussions with stakeholders, including officials of the relevant government\nagencies, representatives of aid agencies, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs). The TA\nis included in ADB\u2019s 2001 TA program1 for Lao PDR.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Lao PDR is a small landlocked country, characterized by mountainous terrain, low\npopulation density combined with a limited pool of skilled human resources, and a wealth of\nnatural  resources  and  environmental  assets,  including  globally  significant  biodiversity.  The\nGovernment is seeking to transform and diversify the country\u2019s predominantly resource-based\neconomy  while  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  promoting  economic  growth.  The\ncountry\u2019s economy depends primarily on the use of natural resources in the forest, mining,\ntourism,  fisheries,  agriculture,  and  hydropower  sectors.  Since  the  natural  resource  base\nunderpins  the  country's  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  prospects,  the\nGovernment is acutely aware of the importance of conserving environmental resources and\nensuring the environmental and social sustainability of all development activities.\n3. Adoption of a policy and regulatory framework for environmental management and social\nsafeguards  has  been  the  subject  of  considerable  policy  dialogue  and  TA.  A  major\naccomplishment has been the enactment of the Environment Protection Law (EPL), which,\ntogether with relevant environmental provisions in the laws on electricity, roads, land, water\nresources, and forests, provides a relatively sound basis for environmental management in the\ncountry. The next phase in pursuing environmental conservation and social safeguards will\nrequire the adoption of an enabling framework for regulation and compliance, supported by\nmeasures to enhance government capacity and address financial sustainability. Without such a\nframework, the adequate integration of environmental and social issues across all sectors will\nremain elusive. This is especially true in the context of major infrastructure projects for energy\nand transport development, which can have wide ranging, cross-sectoral, and long-term social\nand  environmental  impacts,  and  have  often  lacked  effective  planning,  design  and\nimplementation of environmental and social safeguards.\n4. During the past decade, the Government of the Lao PDR has embarked on an ambitious\nprogram of infrastructure development, especially in hydropower and roads, as the foundation of\nits efforts to lift its people out of poverty. During the same period, wide-ranging TA support by\nADB has been provided to improve the capacity of the Government to deal with environmental\nand social aspects of such development. This support has included two TAs to strengthen the\ncapacity  for  integrated  infrastructure  and  environmental  planning  and  to  strengthen\nenvironmental  impact  assessment.2  However,  because  gaps,  overlaps,  and  contradictions\nremained in the overall policy sphere, the developed national and sector (hydropower and\nroads) environmental assessment guidelines could not be applied. Implementation instruments,\nsuch as decrees and ministerial orders, were still required to put these laws into effect.\n                  \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 11 June 2001.\n2  TA 2734-LAO: Nam Ngum Watershed Management, for $800,000, approved on 23 December 1996; and TA\n3133-LAO: Strengthening Social and Environmental Management, for $950,000, approved on 22 December 1998.", "2\n5. Building on the results of a TA for strengthening social and environmental management\n(TA 3133), a small-scale TA (SSTA)3 from December 2000 and March 2001 assisted the\nGovernment  in  identifying  specific  policy  and  institutional  measures  required  to  integrate\nenvironmental  and  social  aspects  into  energy  and  transport  sector  development.  The  TA\ndemonstrated that there is an inadequate framework for policy implementation that is especially\nevident in major energy and transport infrastructure development.  Improved environmental\nperformance  in  these  sectors  will  require  overcoming  five  related  sets  of  constraints:  (i)\nincomplete  policy  and  regulatory  framework  at  the  national  level;  (ii)  lack  of  policy\nimplementation and institutional capacity at the sector and provincial levels; (iii) inadequate\ncompliance and enforcement mechanisms; (iv) absence of an integrated river basin planning\nand management approach, to guide investments in energy and transport, and to provide a\nstrategic  framework  for  reconciling  competing  interests  in  the  use  of  resources;  and  (v)\ninsufficient  attention  to  sustainable  finance  for  environmental  management  and  social\nsafeguards.\n6. Against this backdrop and following extensive policy dialogue, the Government of the\nLao PDR is embarking on a program of policy reforms for improved environmental management\nand social safeguards in the energy and transport sectors. A proposed Program Loan, included\nin the ADB\u2019s 2001 Country Strategy Program, will seek to support the Government of the Lao\nPDR in addressing a number of essential policy actions: (i) strengthening the national policy and\nregulatory framework for environmental management and social safeguards, (ii) enhancing\npolicy implementation measures and capacity at sector and provincial levels, (iii) improving\ncompliance and enforcement of the EPL, (iv) promoting river basin management as an multi-\nsector  and  integrated  planning  framework  for  energy  and  transport  development,  and  (v)\nestablishing sustainable financing mechanisms.\n7. However, a major constraint to the development process and an area of concern for\nmultilateral and bilateral assistance agencies alike remains the weakness in implementation\ncapacity  in  the  Science  Technology  and  Environment  Agency  (STEA);  the  Department  of\nElectricity of the Ministry of Industry and Handicrafts (MIH); the Department Roads of the\nMinistry  of  Communication,  Transport,  Post  and  Construction  (MCTPC);  and  other  local\nagencies. To ensure better environmental management across all sectors of the economy, the\nassistance  community,  led  by  the  Nordic  countries,  is  focusing  increasingly  on  national\nenvironmental  capacity  building  and  management  and  sustainable  natural  resources\nmanagement. The Danish International Development Agency's overall support frame for 1998 to\n2003 amounts to approximately $39 million. Its Natural Resources and Environment Program\nfor the Lao PDR focuses on three interlinked components: (i) enhanced capacity at the central\ngovernment level in environmental planning and management; (ii) improved urban and industrial\nenvironmental conditions; and (iii) sustained use, protection, and management of wetlands and\nbiodiversity and improved watershed management. The Swedish International Development\nCooperation  Agency  is  supporting  STEA  with  a  $2.2  million  program  to  strengthen\nenvironmental management by building capacity at the central level, while extending STEA\u2019s\npresence  and  impact  at  the  provincial  level  through  further  capacity  building  to  deal  with\nenvironmental matters. Finally, the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation (Norad) has\nbeen more involved in the legislative aspect of environmental management. Following their\nsupport to strengthen environmental legislation, which resulted in the drafting of the EPL, Norad\nis putting together a proposal which will strengthen the judiciary in the implementation of the\n                  \n3  TA 3535-LAO: Energy and Transport Socio-Environmental Management, for $150,000, approved on 10 November\n2000.", "3\nEPL.  Other  international  and  bilateral  assistance  agencies,  such  as  Australian  Agency  for\nInternational Development, the European Commission, the Finnish Department for International\nDevelopment Cooperation, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the United Nations\nDevelopment  Programme  have  been  active  in  the  environment  sector,  especially  in  their\nsupport for biodiversity conservation, community-based forestry conservation and management,\nand watershed management.\n8. Given this framework of long-term capacity building, in the process of undertaking the\naforementioned  policy  dialogue  and  in  consultation  with  the  active  donors,  ADB  and  the\nGovernment identified critical short-term gaps for which assistance is needed to accelerate the\npolicy and institutional commitments. The TA is designed to fill this short-term need.\nIII.  THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The  goal  of  the  TA  is  improved  environmental  management  and  social  safeguard\nperformance in the energy and transport sectors. The objective of the TA is to assist the\nGovernment in (i) strengthening compliance and enforcement mechanisms for the EPL, (ii)\nestablishing sustainable financial mechanisms for environmental management, and (iii) creating\na policy framework for involuntary resettlement and compensation and the institutionalization of\npublic involvement.\nB.  Scope\n10. The scope of the TA is divided into three parts. Part A will assist the Government in\nundertaking  a  number  of  activities  related  to  improved  compliance  and  enforcement.  In\nparticular,  it  will  support  (i)  design  of  performance  bond  arrangements  that  would  ensure\nimplementation of social and environmental mitigation activities for major infrastructure projects;\n(ii)  introduction  of  procedures  for  full  inclusion  of  mitigation  requirements  from  project\nenvironmental  management  plans  and  resettlement  action  plans  in  project  concession\nagreements,  financial  arrangements,  and  other  contractual  documents;  (iii)  design  and\nimplementation of compliance reporting mechanisms for the roads and power sectors; and (iv)\nconfiguration and establishment of a third-party monitoring system for sensitive projects. Part A\nwill also assist the Government in reviewing the potential for introducing user charges for\nselected  environmental  services  that  could  help  finance  Government\u2019s  regulatory,  review,\nmonitoring, and compliance functions.\n11. Part B will assist the Government in undertaking necessary exploratory work to establish\nan Environment and Social Fund, which would finance environmental management and social\nsafeguard activities. It will support the Government in undertaking necessary legal, institutional,\nregulatory, budgetary, financial, and policy analyses associated with establishing such a Fund.\n12. Part C will assist the Government in developing and finalizing a national involuntary\nresettlement and compensation policy and implementing regulations for major projects, and\nsectoral guidelines for the energy and transport sectors. It will also assist the Government in\nundertaking the necessary consultative processes to ensure broad stakeholder agreement on\nkey principles of the policy and guidelines. It will also include support for government staff to\ninspect/participate  in  ongoing  project  implementation  of  involuntary  resettlement  and\ncompensation and environmental mitigation programs. Part C will also assist the Government in", "4\ndeveloping  clear  national  public  involvement  guidelines  that  will  substantially  improve  the\nidentification  of  potential  environmental  and  social  issues  associated  with  infrastructure\ndevelopments. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $710,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $600,000\nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $483,000, and $117,000 equivalent of\nthe local currency costs. The Government will contribute the balance of the local currency cost\nof $110,000 as in-kind provision of experienced counterpart staff, office space, information and\ndata collection, transportation assistance, and communications. The TA will be financed by ADB\non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Details of\ncost estimates and a financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Executing Agency for the TA will be STEA. It will provide the necessary qualified\ncounterpart staff and office space for the consultants. A senior official will be appointed to serve\nas TA project manager. A steering group chaired by the Minister, Department of Environment,\nand comprising senior representatives of MCTPC, MIH, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Justice,\nand the Committee for Planning and Cooperation will be established to meet at least quarterly to\nreview and guide TA implementation.\n15. The TA will commence in November 2001 and will be implemented over a 16-month\nperiod, until March 2003. Consulting services will include 16 person-months of international\nconsultants,  with  expertise  in  environment  and  resource  economics,  environmental  funds,\ncompany law, resettlement, and public participation; and 21 person-months of local consultants,\nwith  expertise  in  institutional  and  legal  analysis  and  public  administration  and  social\ndevelopment,  to  facilitate  research  and  consultation.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited\nindividually in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the simplified\ntechnical proposal procedures. The terms of reference for the consulting services are shown in\nAppendix 3. The domestic consultants will be recruited by the resource economist and the\nresettlement specialist, respectively. All equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. Upon completion of the TA, the equipment will be turned over to\nthe Government, which will ensure the availability of these items for any future ADB projects or\nTAs.\n16. Each of the international consultants will submit (i) an inception report, within four weeks\nof commencement of the tasks, and (ii) a final report, as indicated in their specific terms of\nreference, related to the output of their tasks. In addition, brief monthly progress reports will be\nrequired when other reports are not due.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Lao People\u2019s\nDemocratic Republic in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of\nCapacity  Building  for  Environment  and  Social  Management  in  Energy  and  Transport,  and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "5 Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Risks and\nIndicators/Targets Mechanisms Assumptions\nGoal\nTo promote sustainable Sustainable economic State of the Political will to address\nand equitable and social development, environment reports environment and social\ndevelopment in the Lao while preserving development continues\nPDR existing natural Regular sector reviews to deepen.\nresources endowment\nPurpose\nTo improve Improvement in Consultant's reports Sufficient human\nenvironmental environmental (monthly progress, resources are available.\nmanagement and social compliance and interim, completion)\nsafeguard performance enforcement Continued government\nin the energy and TA review missions commitment.\ntransport sectors Establishment of\nsustainable financial Tripartite meetings Other international\nmechanisms for among Government, assistance agencies\nenvironmental ADB and consultants and NGOs will attend\nmanagement workshops.\nWorkshop reports and\nEstablishment of a outputs\nnational policy\nframework for\ninvoluntary resettlement\nand compensation, as\nwell as public\ninvolvement\nComponents/ Outputs\nImproved environmental Improvement of Consultant's reports;
