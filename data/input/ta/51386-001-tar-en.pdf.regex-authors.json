INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of a \nmore efficient public health financing system in Mongolia by creating an effective health services \npurchasing model, including policy reforms and institutional development.1 This is to shift state \nfunding from financing budget lines (input-based) to purchasing services (output-based), to allow \nfor a more equitable health care system. The TA will lay the foundation for strategic purchasing \nin the health sector,2 which will be implemented under a proposed multitranche financing facility \nfor Improving  Access to  Health  Services  for Disadvantaged  Groups.3 The TA  will  support \nMongolia in promoting a more equitable health care system and universal health coverage \n(Sustainable Development Goal 3). \n \n2.  The TA4 is included in the country operations business plan, 2019\u20132021 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Mongolia.5 It is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for \nMongolia, 2017\u20132020 and Operational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Despite  successful  health  reforms  since  2005,  Mongolia  continues  to  experience \ninadequate and inequitable access to quality health services, especially among disadvantaged \ngroups, and high out-of-pocket expenses (OPEs). Total public expenditure on health is 3.4% of \ngross domestic product, which is below the World Health Organization\u2019s target of 5.0%. State \nbudget funding has increased nominally for the last 10 years, but government health spending as \na proportion of total public spending and as a proportion of gross domestic product has dropped. \nMongolia needs to increase public financing on health and improve its effective use. Hospitals \nhave three revenue sources: state funding (70%); health insurance funds (about 20%); and other \nsources, mainly OPEs paid directly by patients (10%). The effective management and use of \nthese funds are greatly needed to transform the health care financing system into an output-based \nsystem with stronger financial protection for the poor. \n \n                                                \n1  Purchasing refers to the allocation of pooled funds to providers that deliver health care goods and services to the \ncovered population, as per the defined benefit package. \n2  With strategic purchasing, purchasers in the health sector, usually government or public purchasers, define what \nhealth services will be provided, the cost of providing these services, how these services will be delivered, and who \nwill deliver them. Strategic purchasing (i) aims to use payment levels and methods to move toward universal health \ncoverage, (ii) involves an overall resource allocation discussion, and (iii) moves away from the individual bilateral \nrelationship between one purchaser and a single provider. Most developing member countries, including Mongolia, \nuse passive ways to purchase health services, such as direct out-of-pocket payments by patients, government \nbudgetary allocation based on historical trends with no link to what is being provided, and health insurance benefits \nand payment methods that do not demand contracted providers to support universal health coverage goals. \nCountries that demonstrate effective strategic purchasing in the health sector include Germany, Italy, Japan, the \nNetherlands, and the United Kingdom. These countries have developed well-established governance arrangements, \nbenefit packages with market-based fee schedules and medicine costs, payment systems, and information \nmanagement and reporting systems. \n3  The proposed multitranche financing facility is included in the latest country operations business plan of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for Mongolia (ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021. \nManila). ADB Board approval is scheduled in the first quarter of 2019. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2018. \n5  ADB. 2018.

State funding challenges. The Integrated Budget Law, 2013 mandates a unified budget \napproved by Parliament. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) manages a single account consisting of \nstate and local government funding and health insurance funds. State funding in its current setup \nis inefficient. Its budgeting, allocation, and control are entirely budget line item-based, leading to \ncomplete passive financing of health services. This is mostly based on historical budgets that are \npoorly linked to actual cost, the volume of services, and inefficient resource allocation. As a result, \nhospitals have no incentive to be efficient or to provide quality health services. Changing the \ncurrent provider payment method from budget line (input-based) to purchasing services (output-\nbased) will increase the efficiency of care and the quality of services.7 \n \n5.  Lack of coherence between Ministry of Health (MOH) policies and the MOF\u2019s budgeting \nand fund allocation reinforces the passive nature of services purchased with state funds. The \ncurrent setup does not incentivize health providers to deliver more rational care (e.g., penalizing \nthe excess use of antibiotics by withholding payments). The performance assessment system for \nbudget managers and providers that was established more than a decade ago is not effective, \ni.e., results of the assessments have no real effect on resource allocation. \n \n6.  Health insurance funds challenges. The Health Insurance Organization (HIO) under the \nMOH is responsible for managing health insurance funds by contracting public and private service \nproviders.8 The HIO has been granted some degree of autonomy, but its operations are strictly \nwithin the unified budget framework.  Thus, HIO is not able to act as an active purchaser to ensure \nefficient resource allocation. For instance, the control of expenses is based on line items and \nhistorical trends that lack flexibility in allocating funds to priority areas. \n \n7.  The HIO\u2019s institutional capacity has improved since 2013 with ADB support.9 The key \noperational system of purchasing functions requires further improvement, however, and HIO staff \ncapacity for fund management, contracting, contract management, and quality monitoring needs \nstrengthening. \n \n8.  Out-of-pocket expense challenges. OPEs in Mongolia\u2019s health sector are very high \nbecause of weak purchasing practices, unnecessary admissions, overprescription of drugs, \nunregulated setting of schedule fees leading to abuse, health insurance-imposed ceilings on \nreimbursement of diagnostic tests, and gaps in benefit packages. Overall, high OPEs and \ninefficient resource allocations in the sector have resulted in limited financial protection for \nMongolians against ill health. In 2014, 0.41% of households fell below the national poverty line \nbecause of health payments. If these high OPEs continue, the number of poor households is \nexpected to increase.10 \n \n9.  The government has committed to decreasing the share of OPEs and state funding, and \nincreasing the expenses to be covered by health insurance funds managed by the HIO. To \nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of public health financing and accelerate the attainment \n                                                \n7  World Health Organization.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: health status of Mongolians improved.11 The \nTA will have the following outcome: strategic purchaser model approved and initiated.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Strategic purchasing model defined. The TA will (i) assess the current \nfunding of hospitals, the regulatory framework, and the purchasing practices in the health sector; \n(ii) design an integrated purchasing system; and (iii) develop a road map and a required regulatory \nframework for the introduction and implementation of the strategic purchaser in Mongolia\u2019s health \nsector. \n \n12.  Output 2: Government and health care provider capacity and capability for strategic \npurchasing implementation strengthened. The TA will facilitate the implementation of the \nstrategic  purchaser.  It  will  (i)  create  awareness  through  information,  education,  and \ncommunication activities related to strategic purchasing to address potential resistance in the \ngovernment and the health sector; (ii) carry out a training needs assessment and program for \ngovernment entities involved in health services purchasing, i.e., the MOF, the MOH, selected local \ngovernments, and the National Health Insurance Council,13 to (a) enhance stewardship, planning \nand policy prioritization, and coordination for strategic purchasing; and (b) improve governance \nto oversee health insurance operations in coordination with the MOH; and (iii) train health \nproviders in the public and private sectors to enhance their knowledge and capacity for negotiation \nwith the strategic purchaser. \n \n13.  Output 3: Institutionalization of the strategic purchaser initiated. The TA will (i) map \nhealth  services  and  define  corresponding  benefit  packages,  their  costs,  and  purchasing \nmechanisms  for  services  previously  funded  by  the  state  funds  through  budget  line  items;  \n(ii)  develop  a  performance-based  reporting  system  using  information  and  communication \ntechnology to inform the MOF of the results of purchased health services using state funding; and \n(iii) strengthen the purchasing functions of the HIO, i.e., fund management, contracting, contract \nmanagement, costing, and quality monitoring. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, a meeting room for the project implementation unit and consultants, and other \nin-kind contributions. \n                                                \n11 Government of Mongolia. 2017.
