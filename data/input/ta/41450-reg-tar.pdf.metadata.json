The governments of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) and the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam requested the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) assistance to prepare the \nproposed Ban Sok\u2013Pleiku Power Transmission Project for possible ADB financing.1 Preliminary \nfact-finding was undertaken during 11\u201315 February 2008, and the project\u2019s concept clearance \nwas  obtained  on  17  March  2008.  Subsequently  the  mission  was  upgraded  to  fact-finding \nmission as it reached an understanding with the governments on the objectives, scope, cost \nestimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  this  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  Lao  PDR  has  significant  hydropower  potential,  estimated  at  about  18,000 \nmegawatts  (MW),  but  only  663  MW  has  been  harnessed  so  far.  Thirty-three  potential \nhydropower sites have been evaluated for development, and 11 projects with a total capacity of \n4,000  MW  are  expected  to  be  developed  in  the  next  15  years.  Realizing  the  country\u2019s \nhydroelectric power potential is challenging due to domestic resource constraints on financing \nits  development.  Recognizing  the  need  to  attract  financing,  the  Government  is  strongly \npromoting private sector involvement. Consequently, most of the future projects are being \ndeveloped  by  independent  power  producers  under  concession  agreements  with  the \nGovernment. Due to fairly low domestic power demand and rapidly growing power demand in \nother parts of Southeast Asia, most of the country\u2019s hydropower is destined for export, which \nprovides an opportunity to generate much-needed foreign currency revenue. This revenue will \nenable investments in rural electrification as well as in other social development and poverty \nreduction programs. The Lao PDR\u2019s export of hydropower also benefits other Southeast Asian \ncountries such as Thailand and Viet Nam by providing economically efficient and climate-\nfriendly power sources.  \n \n3.  Viet Nam's economic growth over the past decade was on average about 7.5% per \nannum. This growth was achieved through sustained business-led growth in economic output \nand employment. Viet Nam faces a growing electricity supply deficit as a result of strong \neconomic growth. The Sixth Power Development Plan (2006\u20132020) projects electricity demand \nto grow at 16% per annum (base-case scenario) during 2006\u20132010, slowing to 11% per annum \nduring 2011\u20132015, and remaining at 9% per annum for the remainder of the period. Such high \ngrowth rates reflect the country\u2019s high level of economic activity. To meet its demand, Viet Nam \nis exploring the possibility of importing electricity from its neighboring countries, especially \nCambodia, the Lao PDR, and the People\u2019s Republic of China, where investments in hydropower \nprojects make importation competitive compared to local coal- and gas-fired power generation. \nThe governments of the Lao PDR and Viet Nam signed a framework agreement in March 2008 \nto trade power. It provides power sale arrangements of up to 5,000 MW by 2020. \n \n4.  Regional electricity trade through interconnectivity of electric power grids will provide \nsignificant  economic  benefits  for  individual  countries.  Such  trade  will  enable  Viet  Nam  to \n(i) reduce  national  investments  in  the  power  reserves  maintained  to  meet  peak  demand; \n(ii) provide a more reliable supply of electricity, including power supply from an interconnected \nnetwork in case of power failure; (iii) reduce operational costs; (iv) reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and other pollutants; and (v) increase consumers\u2019 access to the cheaper and most \nenvironment-friendly sustainable source of electricity. In the Lao PDR, it will provide foreign \nrevenues  from  taxes  on  the  sale  of  electricity  and  from  wheeling  charges  (i.e.,  use  of \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 March \n2008. \n ", "2   \ntransmission charges) that will help the country to implement, among other things, its rural \nelectrification program. \n \n5.  The country strategy and program for the Lao PDR has recognized the importance of \ndeveloping hydropower for export in order to generate foreign currency income through royalties, \ntaxes, and dividends to the Government, which will in turn contribute to the country\u2019s broader \nsocial and economic development.2 In addition, the regional cooperation strategy and program \nupdate  for  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  focuses  on  (i)  strengthening  physical \ninfrastructure for cross-border connectivity, and (ii) integrating national markets for promoting \neconomic efficiency and private sector development.3 The GMS\u2019s power market is moving \ntoward effective regional cooperation, and the Lao PDR is one of the pioneering countries in \nbilateral power trade in accordance with the GMS\u2019s Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional \nPower Trade and the memorandum of understanding that was signed in Vientiane at the Third \nGMS Summit on 31 March 2008.  \n \n6.  The proposed project will consist of four components: (i) construction of a 65 kilometer \n(km), 500 kilovolt (kV), double-circuit transmission line from the Ban Sok substation in the Lao \nPDR to the Viet Nam border, (ii) construction of a 100 km, 500 kV, double-circuit transmission \nline from the Lao PDR border to the Pleiku substation in Viet Nam, (iii) construction of a 500/230 \nkV Ban Sok substation, and (iv) extension of the existing Pleiku 500/230kV substation. The \n500 kV transmission line and the Ban Sok substation will be used as a common transmission \nfacility to initially evacuate power from the Xe Kaman 1 (488 MW), Upper Se Kong 3 (152 MW), \nLower Se Kong 3 (96 MW), and Dak Emeule (138 MW) hydropower projects. A total of 11 \nhydropower projects have been identified in southern Lao PDR with a total installed capacity of \n1,300 MW, out of which about 1,000 MW will be exported through the Ban Sok\u2013Pleiku power \ntransmission line. The facilities in the Lao PDR will be owned by Electricit\u00e9 du Laos (EdL) and \nwill be operated and maintained by a joint venture between EdL and the National Transmission \nCompany (NTC)4 or any other form of association that will ensure reliability of the transmission \nfacilities and at the same time provide necessary capacity building to EdL. Each hydropower \nproject will construct a dedicated power transmission line to the Ban Sok substation.  \n \n7.  By mid-2013, the Xe Kaman 1 hydropower project will be commissioned, followed by the \nUpper Se Kong 3, and the Lower Se Kong 3 in 2014. By the end of 2012, the Ban Sok\u2013Pleiku \n500  kV  power  transmission  line  and  the  associated  substation  should  be  complete  and \noperating.  \n \n8.  The proposed project is expected to be financed using ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nboth in the Lao PDR and in Viet Nam. The corresponding loan\u2019s debt service in the Lao PDR \nmust be fully covered by the additional foreign currency revenue to be earned through wheeling \ncharges. The loan will be structured as a project loan.  \n \n9.  This will be the second 500 kV transborder power interconnection in the Lao PDR,5 and \nthe technical capability of EdL to operate such transmission facilities at the required level of \nreliability may not be sufficient. The TA will propose the best suitable institutional and financial \narrangement to meet the technical requirements and at the same time ensure that the cost of \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be to allow the export of 1,000 MW of electricity from the Lao \nPDR to Viet Nam.  \n \n11.  The outcome of the TA will be to formulate the proposed project\u2019s financing program, \nand to prepare two loans (one for the Lao PDR and the other for Viet Nam) which are structured \nand scheduled to suit the commercial operation schedule of the hydropower developers. The TA \nconsultants  will  also  prepare  and  propose  a  suitable  model  and  arrangements  for  the \nsubsequent operation and maintenance (O&M) of the common transmission facilities in the Lao \nPDR and Viet Nam.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  two  stages,  with  a  break  between  the  two. \nImplementation of the second stage will be triggered when the due diligence on the associated \nfacilities as described in paras. 13 and 14 is executed, and when ADB gets the assurance from \nthe Government of Lao PDR that the retrofit plans, mitigation measures, and recommendations \nwill be implemented.  \n \n13.  In the first stage a due diligence will be carried out,  on the associated facilities in the \nLao  PDR  (i.e.,  hydropower  plants  and  their  transmission  lines  to  Ban  Sok  substation)  in \naccordance with ADB policies and guidelines on environmental assessments. This review will \ncover both component areas, taking into account the likely impacts associated with location, \ndesign, and construction activities. Special attention will be paid to the proposed project\u2019s \nproximity to, and anticipated impacts on, protected cultural and ecological areas. \n \n14.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s relevant policies and guidelines, the TA will prepare a sample-\nbased  social  impact  assessment  of  the  proposed  project  and  its  associated  facilities  (the \nassociated facilities being the transmission lines connecting the Ban Sok substation to the Xe \nKaman 1, the Lower and Upper Xe Kong 3, and the Dak Emeule hydropower stations) to \nprovide  adequate  information  including  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  and  potential \nimpacts on ethnic minority groups. If there are any impacts on ethnic minority people, the TA will \nprovide  mitigation  measures  and/or  affirmative  activities  to  ensure  that  the  people  are \nsafeguarded  during  the  construction  and  project  implementation  period.  The  TA  will  (i) \nundertake due diligence of the resettlement plans and their implementation for the Xe Kaman 1, \nLower and Upper Xe Kong 3, and Dak Emeule power plants and transmission line facilities; (ii) \nidentify the gaps with national and ADB social safeguards policies; and (iii) prepare retrofit \nresettlement plans to address the gaps.  \n \n15.  In the second stage, the TA will (i) review the power development plans of both the Lao \nPDR  and  Viet  Nam,  and  assess  the  commercial  operation  commencement  dates  of  the \nproposed independent hydropower producers in the Lao PDR; (ii) do the technical design of the \nproposed power transmission line and associated substations; (iii) prepare the cost estimates, \nprocurement plan, and implementation schedule; (iv) assess the wheeling charges based on the \ninvestment,  depreciation,  and  amount  of  energy  to  be  transmitted;  (v)  propose  the  O&M \narrangements for the transmission facilities that will include necessary capacity-building of EdL; \n ", "4   \n(vi) write the technical specifications for the transmission line and associated substations; (vii) \ncarry out an economic and financial analysis of the project; and (viii) carry out the environmental \nand  social  assessment  of  the  project.  For  the  project  components  (transmission  lines \nconnecting to the Ban Sok substation, the Ban Sok substation itself, and extension of the Pleiku \nsubstation), the TA will also prepare (i) two resettlement plans (one for each country), including \nany ethnic minority-specific actions for the substations if social impacts that trigger ADB\u2019s social \nsafeguard policies will result;  6 (ii) two environmental impact assessments (EIAs); (iii) two \nsummary  EIAs,  if  required;  and  (iv)  two  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEEs)  and  a \nsummary IEE.  \n \n16.  By undertaking an economic analysis in accordance with ADB guidelines, the economic \nbenefits to the Lao PDR and Viet Nam due to power trading will be identified, and the economic \nrationale for the governments\u2019 investment in the common transmission facility will be justified. In \naddition, the TA will look at the overall benefit for the region.  \n \n17.  The TA will undertake a financial analysis from EdL\u2019s point of view. It will recommend the \noverall  level  of  wheeling  charges  and  a  methodology  for  allocating  them  to  the  various \nhydropower projects by taking into account the construction costs, O&M costs, financing costs \nincluding  interest  during  construction,  and  the  timing  of  the  various  projects'  commercial \noperation. The detailed cost estimates for components in both countries will be prepared in \naccordance with ADB guidelines on identifying local and foreign costs, taxes, interest during \nconstruction,  and  price  and  physical  contingencies.  The  TA  will  analyze  the  financial \nimplications  for  EdL\u2019s  overall  financial  performance  due  to  its  ownership  of  the  common \ntransmission facility, and update EdL\u2019s financial projections, which were prepared under earlier \nADB technical assistance.7 Overall financial projections of Vietnam Electricity (EVN) will also be \nundertaken under the TA. \n \n18.  With  respect  to  the  hydropower  companies\u2019  power  purchase  agreement  (PPA) \nobligations, the TA will also undertake due diligence of additional commercial risks for EdL and \nEVN  and  NTC  due  to  their  ownership  of  the  transmission  line,  and  propose  suitable \nmechanisms  to  mitigate  these  risks.  These  mechanisms  will  include  recommendations  on \ninstitutional arrangements for the common transmission facility\u2019s ownership, O&M agreements \nfor the facility with EVN or NTC or other experienced contractor, and contractual obligations on \nthe  transmission  line\u2019s  reliability.  The  TA  will  prepare  model  legal  documentation  for  the \npayment of wheeling charges by the hydropower developers to EdL, consistent with the PPA \nand the contractual agreements. Contractual and legal mechanisms will be proposed for the \nwheeling charges to have first priority for debt service, including the establishment of an escrow \naccount for debt service.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent for both countries, comprising $1,000,000 \nin foreign currency and $300,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $1,000,000. The \nTA is proposed to be financed on a grant basis through the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government of the Lao PDR will finance $150,000 equivalent of \nlocal currency cost through in-kind contributions, as will the Government of Viet Nam. These \ncontributions include office accommodation and facilities, counterpart staff, data, and other \ninformation needed for the TA. Detailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n                                                 \n6  ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998). \n7  ADB. 2006.

ADB will be the executing agency. The Ministry of Energy and Mines in the Lao PDR \nand the National Transmission Company (NTC), a subsidiary of EVN, in Viet Nam will be the \nimplementing agencies. They will assist in preparing and collecting data, participate in the \ntripartite meetings, and help organize the meetings as necessary. To help the consultants carry \nout the feasibility studies in a timely manner, each government will make available a team of \ncounterpart staff consisting of representatives from the ministries and utilities concerned, and \narrange for the concerned utility to provide office accommodation, local communication facilities, \noffice support staff, and other administrative support including arrangements for the consultant\u2019s \ntravel to project areas. Each government will undertake necessary consultation and workshops \nwith  stakeholders,  project-affected  people,  and  civil  society  including  nongovernment \norganizations, and will post relevant project documents on their respective website in local \nlanguages. \n \n21.  The TA will require about 48 person-months of consulting services, including 24 person-\nmonths of international and 26 person-months of national consulting services. The consulting \nteam will consist of power system planning, transmission line, substation, financial, economics, \nlegal, environmental, and social development specialists. The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 4. The consultants will submit the following reports to the Ministry of Energy and \nMines, NTC, and ADB: \n(i)  an inception report within 1 month after commencement of services, \n(ii)  an interim report 4 months after the commencement of services, \n(iii)  a draft final report 6 months after the commencement of services, and \n(iv)  a final report 8 months after the commencement of services. \n \n22.  A consulting firm will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). A simplified technical proposal format and \nthe  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  (80:20  ratio)  will  be  used.  The  TA  will  be \ncompleted in 8 months, from 1 October 2008 to 1 June 2009. Dissemination of the results will \noccur through external press releases to news agencies, consultation with various organizations, \nand  disclosure  on  the  ADB  website.  No  major  risks  are  associated  with  the  TA,  and  the \ngovernments of both countries have expressed their strong support. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Hydropower is the most abundant natural resource in the Lao PDR and represents the country\u2019s single largest \nforeign exchange source, accounting for 30% of total earnings. Therefore, the Government is emphasizing the \nfurther development of the export-oriented hydropower project and private sector investment to develop similar \nprojects. The Government also recognizes that a factor contributing to poverty reduction is improvement in \nmarket access internally and with neighboring countries. The country strategy program for the Lao PDRa \nrecognized the importance of developing a hydropower resource as an export commodity in order to generate \nforeign currency for the Government through royalties, taxes, and dividends on government investment in \nhydropower projects. These projects will contribute to the country\u2019s broader social and economic development \nthrough increased Government revenue. The regional country strategy program (2007\u20132009) for the GMSb is \nbased on four pillars, including (i) strengthening physical infrastructure for cross-border connectivity, and (ii) \nintegrating national markets for promoting economic efficiency and private sector development. The proposed \nproject, which will establish a 500 kV power transmission line between the Lao PDR and Viet Nam and support \nprivate hydropower investors in the Lao PDR, is in line with ADB\u2019s strategy.  \nB.  Targeting Classification \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention (GI)   Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs \n(TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The proposed project is aimed at providing bulk power \ntransmission between Viet Nam and the Lao PDR and contributing to the Lao PDR\u2019s general economic growth \nthrough increased revenues to the Government that can be used for poverty reduction programs. In Viet Nam, \nthis will provide cheap and clean energy and will postpone new investment in terms of thermal power \ngeneration. \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? Not \napplicable. \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? The PPTA will undertake due diligence on population \ndirectly affected by the proposed project to ensure that ADB\u2019s safeguard policies are fully complied with.  \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-\npoor governance, and pro-poor growth)? There is no opportunity for pro-poor design as the proposed project \ndoes not have direct beneficiaries other than the Government of the Lao PDR through royalties, taxes, and \ndividends.  \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the Project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the Project? The proposed project\u2019s primary beneficiaries are the governments of the Lao PDR and Viet \nNam and the private sector hydropower developers who will be using the transmission line to transmit power to \nViet Nam. The Lao PDR\u2019s general and poor population will indirectly benefit through poverty reduction programs \nto be financed through the Government\u2019s additional revenues from hydropower exports to Viet Nam. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Not applicable.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? Not applicable. \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \nThe stakeholders include the private sector hydropower developers who will use the common transmission \nfacility; commercial financers to the hydropower projects; government entities such as the Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry of Energy and Mines, and EdL; EVN; the population affected by the project due to land acquisition; \nand the civil society and nongovernment organizations interested in hydropower development in the Lao PDR. \n2.  What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? Extensive consultation will be undertaken with the parties that have a commercial interest \nin the proposed project, including private sector investors. IEE findings will be made available to the interested \nparties. Consultation will be undertaken with people directly affected by the proposed project with respect to \nland acquisition and resettlement.  \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision-making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain. The consultation process will be included \nin the resettlement plan.   \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThe gender issues are related to the resettlement impacts and will be addressed through mainstreaming the \ngender strategy in the resettlement plan.  \n \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?       Yes          No.    No gender component is required in the project \ndesign.  However,  gender  equality  must  be  secured  when  hiring  construction  laborers  during  project \nimplementation.  \n \n3.  Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes         No    The proposed project will have positive impacts on women by providing cheaper and \nadditional electric supply in Viet Nam and additional sources of revenue to the Lao PDR that can be \nredistributed to widen gender equality.  \nIII.
