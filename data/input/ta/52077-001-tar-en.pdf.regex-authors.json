INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) addresses the need to \ndevelop a scalable pipeline of green and bankable infrastructure projects across Southeast Asia.1 \nIntegrating environmental sustainability (or \u201cgreening\u201d) and financial sustainability in projects \nrequires massive private sector funds from commercial, institutional, and other sources, as well \nas  technology  and  management  efficiencies. 2  To  achieve  this,  public  sector  funds  and \napproaches must be better leveraged through innovative project financing structures. Most \nSoutheast Asian developing countries are unfamiliar with such structures, and the TA will focus \non building green, innovative financing models, mechanisms, capacities, and concepts that can \nbe mainstreamed in Southeast Asian project pipelines. \n \n2.  The TA responds directly to demands by the developing member countries (DMCs) that \nmultilateral development banks develop approaches to development finance that will strategically \nunlock, leverage, and catalyze private flows and domestic resources.3 The TA supports DMCs\u2019 \nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement on \nClimate Change (COP21),4 consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Strategy 2030 \nand the Green Finance Catalyzing Facility concept.5 It also assists DMCs, especially upper \nmiddle-income countries, to explore innovative ways to mobilize resources, and support and \nstrengthen institutions to address challenges such as climate change. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Urgency of greening infrastructure for development. The Paris Agreement and the \nSDGs highlight the urgent need for sustainable, climate-proofed infrastructure development. The \nincreasingly visible impacts of unsustainable development and climate change are estimated to \nhave caused in 2010 about $1.2 trillion in economic losses and 5 million deaths worldwide.6 \n \n4.  Rising financing needs and gaps. Demand for infrastructure investment in developing \nAsia  is  estimated  at  $26.2  trillion  during  2016\u20132030,  including  for  climate  mitigation  and \nadaptation costs, with Southeast Asia alone requiring $3.1 trillion.7 Various estimates indicate the \nneed for greater private sector financing ranging between 50% to 90% in some instances, to meet \nthese investment needs .8 Despite various public\u2013private partnership enabling initiatives in a \nnumber of countries, the scale of private sector investments has yet to attain the momentum \nneeded to close the financing gap, estimated at $102 billion per year for selected Southeast Asian \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on \n20 February 2018. \n2  For ADB, infrastructure is sustainable if it is designed, built, and operated to be durable and in ways that are socially \nequitable and economically viable, while protecting the environment. \n3  World Bank Group-International Monetary Fund. 2015.

As an operational priority under Strategy 2030, ADB will provide increased support for climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability. Climate finance from ADB\u2019s \nown resources will reach $80 billion cumulatively from 2019-2030. \n6  DARA and the Climate Vulnerable Forum. 2012. Climate Vulnerability Monitor 2nd edition.

A Concept for Leveraging Blended Finance for Green Development. Manila. \n \n ", "2 \ncountries between 2016-2020.9 Financing gaps are attributed mainly to a lack of bankable project \npipelines.  \n \n5.  Deepening private finance access. The public sector has been the major source of \nfinancing  for  infrastructure  in  Southeast  Asia.  With  rising  investment  requirements  and \nconstrained public budgets, greater levels of private investment are therefore needed. Developing \ncountries need to rapidly increase their access to a full range of private finance sources, including \ninstitutional finance (pension and insurance funds hold $10 trillion in assets in Asia), capital \nmarkets (project debt or equity issuance), and commercial banks.10 \n \n6.  Bankability  constraints  resulting  from  poor  project  financing  structures  and \ngreening requirements. Inefficient risk allocation makes projects unattractive to private finance. \nSome of the commonly identified risks include (i) poor project development; (ii) unproven or \nunpredictable revenue streams; (iii) delays in land acquisition and environmental clearances, and \n(iv) additional costs from the use of new or green technology which do not necessarily translate \ninto commensurate increases in revenues (often referred to as unquantified green benefits). \nThese challenges at a project level are compounded by (i) weak government capacities, policies \nand systems, especially at local government levels, and (ii) financial system issues such as lack \nof exit options through liquid capital markets which institutional investors often require. \n \n7.  Leveraging public and climate funds to enhance bankability. Bankability risks in \nprojects can be mitigated through better application of budgetary funds as well as climate funds \nfrom the Global Environment Facility, the Green Climate Fund, and Climate Investment Funds. \nHowever, this requires both willingness on the part of governments to leverage public funds to \ncatalyze private finance into projects (this is increasingly visible in upper middle-income countries), \nand adequate capacities. This has led to initiatives such as the Global Urbis\u2014announced at the \n2018 One Planet Summit by French President Emmanuel Macron\u2014to provide global cities with \nfinancing and TA to mobilize private capital.11  \n \n8.  Innovative structured finance models. The development of innovative finance in this \ncontext refers to developing financial structures that enable projects to transition to financial \nsustainability or bankability and thereby attract financing from nontraditional sources (i.e., private \ncapital) to supplement traditional public capital. The use of public funds could be critical in such \ntransition period structures, for instance, to meet gaps in initially unproven revenue projections or \nto meet additional technology costs, and then to be replaced by private capital once initial risks \nare mitigated and self-sustainability of projects is achieved. Innovative finance models that \nleverage  public  and  private  funds  include  securitization,  asset  recycling,  blended  finance, \nminimum revenue guarantees, shadow revenues, first loss capital, viability gap finance, social \nimpact investment, and pooled finance vehicles. While many of these structures may be familiar, \ntheir application in the Southeast Asian infrastructure context is generally less common and would \nneed to be adapted and demonstrated. The adoption of such structures in Southeast Asia would \nrequire consideration of evolving capital markets, capacity issues, affordability, and inclusiveness \nobjectives. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2017.

In order to support Southeast Asian countries overcome the various challenges noted \nabove  in  developing  a  scale  of  bankable  projects,  the  TA  aims  to  integrate  capacity  and \ninstitutional  building  at  government  levels  with  development  of  practical  innovative  finance \nstructures and demonstration of such structures in selected projects for future replication. This \nwill assist countries in mainstreaming innovative finance approaches to catalyze the large-scale \nfinancing required to meet their infrastructure needs.12.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: increased share of private capital for green \ninfrastructure projects across Southeast Asia. The TA will have the following outcome: improved \ncapacity of Southeast Asian governments to use innovative finance structures in developing green \nand bankable infrastructure projects that can attract private capital and/or management.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The TA proposes three key outputs. While the largest focus and fund allocation will be for \noutput 2, outputs 1 and 3 are designed to feed into output 2 and ensure sustainability of this \ninitiative once the TA ceases. \n \n12.  Output  1:  Innovative  finance  models  and  mechanisms  for  infrastructure  in \nSoutheast Asia developed. The TA will develop about nine innovative finance models14 (which \nare project or theme-specific), and/or financing mechanisms (which are for a pool of projects) \naimed at developing locally relevant innovative finance structures, including with respect to \nalready identified projects or concepts that can be pitched for further development. An initial \nassessment within ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department (SERD) identified over 20 concepts across \nSoutheast Asia that need innovative finance solutions. These concepts, centered around critical \ndevelopment themes, include national vehicles for green finance in Indonesia or Malaysia, elderly \ncare for Thailand, municipal access to capital markets for Indonesia and the Philippines, blended \nfinance for green corridor for Thailand, asset recycling, state-owned enterprise restructuring, \npooled viability enhancement mechanisms for social sectors, minimum revenue guarantees for \nmass transit, or first loss for renewable energy financing. Concepts for countries with fewer private \ncapital opportunities would include upstream strategy development to improve credit worthiness \nand access to finance. Concepts to be supported will be chosen based on a set of criteria that \nwould  evolve  through  discussions  with  DMCs  and  ADB  sector  experts.  The  models  and \nmechanisms developed under output 1 will be proposed to governments as \u2018investment pitches\u2019 \nwith the aim of identifying projects for further structuring under output 2. \n \n13.  Output 2: Innovative finance pilot transactions developed. The TA will support the \npreparation of at least three innovative finance transactions for piloting, possibly in relevant forms \nof financing transactions for green infrastructure projects. The selection criteria will include the \ngovernment\u2019s readiness to implement projects; and the development impact, leveraging potential, \nclimate impact, replication potential of the concept, and other social benefits including gender \n                                                \n12 The TA is a financial innovation effort that aims to catalyze funds from various sources. It will not cover existing \nproject development facilities for public\u2013private partnerships or project development funds for transaction structuring. \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 A model denotes a standard/template financial structure that prescribes the use of various financing sources for \ncapital or operations expenditures within a specific sectoral context. Models will be developed as practical knowledge \ndocuments.  \n ", "4 \nequality. Each pilot concept will undertake both (i) financial structuring (with completed preliminary \ntechnical feasibility) and (ii) capacity building for the relevant government entity. Using results \nfrom output 1 above, or directly from demands expressed by governments, output 2 will develop \npreliminary financing (capital expenditure) and financial (lifecycle) models for specific projects that \nseek to meet bankability and greening targets. Pilot concepts can be project-specific, mechanism-\nspecific (e.g., pooled finance mechanisms), or entity-specific (e.g., state-owned enterprises). \nCapacity building may include developing institutional systems such as value-for-money tools and \nmonitoring measures. Outputs will be presented as concept notes to governments along with \nsuggestions for financing sources, including from ADB; these will be further developed to the \ntransaction stage at the request of governments, subject to internal due diligence or processing. \n \n14.  Output 3: Sustainable approaches for the green and innovative finance initiative \ndeveloped. To leverage knowledge emerging from the pilot concepts, identify future innovative \nfinance concepts, and provide a road map to sustain this initiative following the TA implementation \nperiod, the TA proposes to (i) create an innovative finance knowledge group\u2014comprised of \ngovernments, the private sector, academia, and institutional investors\u2014with expertise in the \ncurrent thinking and practice with regard to innovative finance; (ii) conduct innovative finance \nround tables; and (iii) develop a proposal for a Southeast Asian green finance knowledge hub.15 \nThrough the innovative finance knowledge group and the relevant SERD Innovation Hub,16 \nknowledge can be shared with public sector decision makers, ADB staff, and more broadly at an \nannual Southeast Asia Green and Innovative Finance Roundtable. The proposal for a Southeast \nAsian green finance knowledge hub will build on demands from Southeast Asia DMCs for \nsustained support in developing green finance projects, policies, and monitoring mechanisms, \nthrough project-incubator-type approaches, and include suggestions for sustaining such a hub \nwith financial support from DMCs or development partners. Two approaches to implement the \nhub would be explored: via a single host country (through its own green finance initiatives, \nproviding regional support) or through regional association structures, such as the ASEAN \nInfrastructure Fund. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and $1,000,000 by TASF-other \nsources. Funds will be used mainly for consultancy services, and to conduct round tables, and \nhold information dissemination and capacity-building events. Discussions will also be undertaken \nwith  other  development  agencies  to  explore  possible  cofinancing. 17  The  scope  and \nimplementation  period  of  the  TA  may  be  extended,  subject  to  fund  availability.  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division, SERD, in close coordination with SERD sector divisions and resident \nmissions. Close collaboration will also be undertaken with ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department, Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership, and Private Sector Operations \nDepartment,  and Thematic  and  Sector  Groups,  where relevant,  to  promote  synergies  with \n                                                \n15 Gender mainstreaming activities will also be considered in the formulation of the proposal. \n16 The SERD Innovation Hub was created in 2018 under the Southeast Asia Regional Cooperation and Operations \nCoordination Division. It works with multidisciplinary ADB staff to create innovative finance solutions for ADB\u2019s DMCs. \n17 Possible cofinanciers include the e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and the People\u2019s Republic of China \nPoverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund. \n ", "5 \nongoing project development efforts. Regular consultations will similarly be held with government \nentities in Southeast Asia during the first year of implementation to assess and select the themes \nto be developed. The models and mechanisms will be presented to governments to confirm which \nare to be further structured as pilot projects to ensure their effective contributions to ADB and \nDMC project pipelines. The TA will be implemented for 36 months, from October 2018 to \nSeptember 2021. \n \n17.  This TA will require a total of 72 person-months of international and 63 person-months of \nnational consulting inputs. Due to diverse requirements, individual consultants (or firms, as \nrequired) will be recruited to provide consulting inputs. The establishment of a qualified panel of \nfirms through framework agreements will be explored at the outset for faster response to client \nneeds. The TA will use output-based, lump-sum contracts, as appropriate. The TA will engage \nexperts in structured finance, legal, and technical project structuring, and a project management \nteam.18 ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and associated project administration instructions and staff instructions. The \nTA will maximize the use of available ADB expertise and will allow the participation of relevant \nstaff as resource persons.
