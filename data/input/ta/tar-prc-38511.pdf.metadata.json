INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During formulation of the 2003 Country Strategy and Program for the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), the Government requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) emphasize \nreforms at the provincial level. During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government \nrequested  that  ADB  provide  a  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (Inner Mongolia) to formulate an energy development strategy as an input \nfor the provincial 11th Five Year Plan (2006\u20132010). A fact-finding mission1 visited Inner Mongolia \n16\u201321 September 2004, confirmed the need for the TA, and reached agreement on the TA\u2019s \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements.2 \nAppendix 1 gives the logical framework for the TA.   \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.   The 12 western provinces, including Inner Mongolia, have benefited less than the east \ncoast from economic growth and reforms. Incomes are lower, poverty is more widespread, \nhealth and education indicators are lower, there are serious land degradation problems, and \nthere  are  weaknesses  in  physical  infrastructure,  including  roads,  railways,  power,  and \ntelecommunications. Through its Western Development Strategy, the Government has made a \nmajor commitment to accelerate development in the western region.  \n \n3.   In  2003  the  average  per  capita  gross  domestic  product  in  Inner  Mongolia  was \nCNY8,734, lower than the national average of CNY9,046. Of 101 counties,  31 are national \npoverty counties and 29 are provincial poverty counties.  The fiscal revenue of the poverty \ncounties cannot cover salaries of the government officials, teachers, and health personnel. \nInvestments in basic education and public health are inadequate. In 2003, about 1.28 million \npeople, more than 10% of Inner Mongolia\u2019s rural population,li ved on incomes below the official \npoverty line,3 vs PRC\u2019s national poverty incidence of 3%. About 2.45 million people,o r 18% of \nthe rural population, had incomes of less than the international poverty line of $1/day.   \n \n \n4.  One of Inner Mongolia\u2019s comparative advantages is its considerable natural resource \nbase, with the potential to provide the basis for future economic development. For example, \nInner Mongolia has deposits of 134 types of mineral resources. Six of these mineral resources, \nincluding rare earth elements and columbium, rank number one among PRC\u2019s provinces; 11 \nresources, including coal and chromium, rank second among provinces; and 63 rank in the top \n10. \n \n5.  Inner Mongolia has abundant energy resources. Proven coal reserves are estimated as \n223 billion tons and prospective coal reserves, as 1,200 billion tons. Coal production can \npotentially reach 500 million tons by 2010, about 20% of PRC\u2019s total production. Allowing for \nconsumption in Inner Mongolia, this output could supply 80,000 Megawatt of coal-fired power \nplants. Considering the proximity to major load centers, large and super-large mine-mouth coal-\nfired plants could be built in Inner Mongolia. Inner Mongolia has proven oil reserves of 700 \nmillion tons and an estimated reserve of 4 billion tons. The proven gas reserves are 1 trillion \ncubic meters, and the prospective reserves, 4.2 trillion cubic meters. The Shan\u2019x-iGansu-\n                                                 \n1 The mission comprised Longyun Peng, team leader, economics officer of People's Republic of China resident \nmission, and Ashok Bhargava, energy specialist, Energy Division, ECRD. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 17 September 2004. \n3 PRC\u2019s official poverty line of CNY637 per capita/year is low compared with international rates.  ", "2  \nNingxia Oil and Gas Field, a recognized world-class oil-gas field, is mostly in Inner Mongolia\u2019s \nErdos Basin. With rising oil prices, the technology of transforming coal to oil or coal liquefaction \nhas become cost competitive. Given its large reserves of coal and successful transformation of \n10 million tons of coal to oil production, Inner Mongolia has demonstrated its potential to \ndevelop \u201ccoal to oil\u201d  projects. There is also potential to develop wind and solar energy in Inner \nMongolia. If developed in a strategic manner, the energy sector could be a major driver of \neconomic development. Driven by the surge in energy-related industries, Inner Mongolia\u2019s gross \ndomestic product (GDP) reached CNY209.3 billion in 2003, a 16.3% increase over 2002. \n \n6.   In 2003, the value addition of the energy sector was CNY15.5 billion, and accounted for \n7.4% of Inner Mongolia\u2019s GDP. The lon-gterm objective is to increase the energy sector\u2019s \ncontribution to the economy to 15% by 2010. The provincial government made development of \nthe energy sector and associated industries a priority in the Ninth Five Year Plan (1996\u20132000). \nBut development of the energy resources has not reached its potential, because of various \nconstraints, including:   \n(i)  Lack of a strategic development program. No comprehensive studies have been \nundertaken to help the government define the strategic importance of the energy \nsector and related resources and industries in both Inner Mongolia and China, and to \nformulate a strategic development plan. There is a need to identify the strengths, \nweaknesses,  opportunities,  constraints,  risks,  and  competitive  threats;  and  to \nforecast  energy  supply-demand  trends,  and  analyze  the  impacts  of  energy \ndevelopment on the environment and social sectors. Such an analysis would provide \nthe basis for developing a strategic plan and estimating the resources required for its \nimplementation.  \n(ii)  Limited  national  priority.  With  no  comprehensive  study  to  demonstrate  the \ndevelopment  potential  of  the  energy  sector  in  Inner  Mongolia,  the  central \nGovernment has not fully recognized its potential to supply natural resources and \nenergy to fulfill the national demand. There is some concern in the world market for \nnatural resources and energy that PRC\u2019s rapidly growing demand is pushing up \nprices.  \n(iii) Regulated pricing.  Although the market determines most prices, the Government \nstill  controls  power  prices,  which  in  turn  negatively  affects  the  coal  price.  The \nregulated pricing mechanism weakens Inner Mongolia\u2019s comparative advantage, and \nconstrains development of the energy sector and related energy industries. Greater \nreliance  on  market  forces  and  competition  would  help  develop  an  enabling \nenvironment for Inner Mongolia\u2019s energy sector .\n(iv) Inadequate  infrastructure.  The  transport  infrastructure  (rail  and  road  links) \nconnecting Inner Mongolia to the demand centers on the east coast is inadequate. \nThe railway cannot carry all of the coal and other natural resources that Inner \nMongolia can produce. Also, capacity of the power transmission system is limited, \nand not all electricity grids are interconnected. This limits the ability to develop new \ncoal-fired mine mouth power plants. Weaknesses in the supporting infrastructure \nhave prevented Inner Mongolia\u2019s energy sector from developing to its full capacity .\n(v) Environmental constraints. Strong mitigation measures are needed to ensure that \nresource  exploitation  does  not  result  in  unacceptable  negative  impacts  on  the \nenvironment. Among other things, the prices of resources should be adequate to \ngenerate funds to finance environmental mitigation measures, to provide incentives \nfor resource conservation, and to offset depletion of natural resources. Current tax \npolicies do not generate sufficient tax revenue for local governments to adequately \naddress  environmental  problems  associated  with  resource  extraction.  While \ndeveloping its fossil fuel reserves, Inner Mongolia should have a complementary \n ", "  3\n \nstrategy  to  maximize  the  supply  side  of  energy  conservation  and  to  develop \nrenewable energy to help offset the adverse impacts of fossil use.  \n \n7.   The planned investment in the energy sector during the10th Five Year Plan is estimated \nas CNY80 billion. If the foregoing constraints are removed, the planned energy investment in \nthe 11th Five Year Plan should increase faster than that in the 10th Five Year Plan. To address \nthese challenges and use its energy/resources as driving forces to help economic development \nand  poverty  reduction,  the  government  of  Inner  Mongolia  has  decided  to  undertake  a \ncomprehensive study on energy, economic, and environmental development. This study will \nprovide key inputs for formulation of Inner Mongolia\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan (2006\u20132010). PRC\u2019s \nrecent energy shortages and high energy prices have created the right environment to draw the \ncentral government\u2019s attention to energy resource-rich regions such as Inner Mongolia.  \n \nIII.   TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n8.  The objective of this TA is to help the government of Inner Mongolia develop an energy \ndevelopment strategy as an input for its 11th Five Year Plan. The strategy will provide policy \nrecommendations to develop Inner Mongolia as a state strategic energy base, and to harmonize \nenergy sector development with overall development of the economy and the environment. \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities  \n  \n9.   The scope of the study includes (i)  formulating an energy development strategy for \nInner Mongolia that is directly relevant for drafting the energy chapter of the 11th Five Year Plan, \nincluding an action plan to implement the recommended energy development strategy; (ii) \ncritically examining models of constructing energy/natural resource bases in various countries, \nand recommending a model to suit local conditions; (iii) conducting a feasibility study on \ndeveloping Inner Mongolia as a state strategic energy base that will analyze/forecast PRC\u2019s \nenergy supply-demand trend, identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, potential risks, and \nconstraints for energy development, and recommending the use of its energy/resources as a \nkey  driver  for  social  and  economic  development;  (iv)  identifying  industrial  linkages  with \nupstream and downstream energy/resource industries and formulating policy recommendations \nfor related industrial restructuring and upgrading; (v) identifying areas for cooperation with \nneighboring provinces in the energy/resource sectors, in providing complimentary infrastructure, \nand in designing an interprovincial cooperation mechanism; and (vi) analyzing interactions \namong energy development,  social and economic development, environmental protection, and \ndesign policies for harmonizing their development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.   The TA cost is estimated at $630,000 equivalent, comprising $270,000 in foreign \nexchange and $360,000 equivalent in local currency. ADB will provide a grant of $500,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $230,000 equivalent of local currency \ncost.  The  Government  will  finance  the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to \n$130,000, by providing counterpart staff, workshop facilities, and logistical support. This TA will \nbe financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Appendix 2 gives cost estimates \nand the financing plan.  \n ", "4  \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.   The Inner Mongolia government will establish a steering committee chaired by Zhao \nShun  Lian,  vice  governor,  and  a  project  office  comprising  members  of  the  Provincial \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  Financial  Department,  Industrial  Office,  Coal \nAdministration, and Environment Office. The Inner Mongolia Financial Department (IMFD) will \nbe the Executing Agency. IMFD will be responsible for organizing and coordinating with various \ndepartments in the Inner Mongolian government to implement, monitor, and review findings of \nthe study. IMFD will provide office facilities, in-city transportation, and access to all relevant \ninformation and data.   \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months, beginning in February 2005 and ending in \nOctober 2005. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nProcurement. Two international consultants and a domestic consulting firm will be selected to \nundertake the TA. The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB.  Two \ninternational experts (6 person-months) with expertise in energy planning and the economics of \nenergy  development  will  be  engaged  to  provide  international  experience  from  similar \nassignments. The domestic consultants (42 person-months) will comprise 15 experts in energy \nplanning; energy economy; social development; environmental management; renewable energy; \ncoal, power, gas, and oil; and an industry specialist.  \n \n13.  Consultants will be divided into six groups, led by a team leader and a deputy team \nleader. Two domestic experts will be nominated as team leader and deputy team leader, and \nwill be responsible for preparing the main report. The other five groups will prepare the reports \ncovering the five topics outlined above, and provide inputs for the main report. The team leader, \nassisted by the deputy team leader, will be responsible for overall supervision and coordination, \nand  monitoring  work  progress  of  the  six  consultant  groups.  Considering  large  group  of \nconsultants and the lack of familiarity of most domestic consultants with ADB procedures, an \nadministrative  assistant  will  be  recruited  to  deal  with  administrative  issues,  including \ncoordinating  with  consultants,  collecting  invoices,  preparing  documents  for  disbursement, \nhelping organize workshops, and interpreting and translating. There will be several consultation \nand dissemination workshops, so an advance payment facility is needed. Appendix 3 gives \nterms of reference for consultants. \n \n14.  The consultants will carry out all the tasks in a consultative manner, encouraging \nstakeholder participation. An inception report will be submitted within 4 weeks after the fieldwork \nbegins.  A  workshop  will  be  organized  to  review  the  consultants\u2019  final  work  program, \nmethodology, and key issues, which may impact TA implementation. The consultants will submit \nan  interim  report  at  the  end  of  the  4-month  period.  The  interim  report  will  analyze  all \ncomponents of the TA and initial recommendations. The consultant will submit a draft final \nreport within 7 months. The consultants will submit the final report, incorporating comments from \nthe Government, ADB, and other stakeholders, within 1 month after receiving such comments.  \n \n15.  Anticorruption  Policy.  During  project  processing,  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was \nexplained  to  Inner  Mongolian  officials.  Attention  was  drawn  to  the  section  on  fraud  and \ncorruption that was added to ADB\u2019sG  uidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants,  particularly  that  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  observe  the \nhighest ethical standards in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions \nif fraud and corruption are discovered. \n ", "  5\n \n \nIV.
