INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2012, during the country program consultation, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Promotion  of  a  Legal  Framework  for  Financial  Consumer \nProtection.1 Following a reconnaissance mission in June 2013 and a fact-finding mission in July \n2013,  ADB  and  the  government  reached  an  understanding  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  Since the global financial crisis in 2008, financial consumer protection has become more \nwidely recognized as a significant factor in contributing to the long-term stability of the financial \nsystem and aiding economic development. Many countries have established new frameworks or \nimproved their existing financial consumer protection mechanisms through new legislation and \ncreation of stronger new supervision schemes. Among others, Canada, the European Union \n(EU), the United Kingdom, and the United States made notable changes to financial consumer \nprotection. Internationally, the Financial Consumer Protection Net of the Group of Twenty (G-20) \nwas upgraded with the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion to promote the communication \nand collaboration of members on financial consumer protection. The PRC is a co-chair of the \nsubgroup on financial consumer protection and financial literacy. \n \n3.  This TA on enhancing financial consumer protection is the first of its kind in the PRC for \nADB.  Financial  consumer  protection  and  financial  literacy  are  key  elements  for  financial \ninclusion. ADB has already performed much work in support of financial inclusion in the PRC \nthrough ongoing projects in rural and microfinance, and financial services for small and medium-\nsized enterprises. Various other donor entities have generally performed work on financial \nliteracy issues. \n \n4.  The government has nationally designated that each September will be a month of \nfinancial literacy education, beginning in 2013. This action signifies the high priority that the \ngovernment  has  placed  on  financial  consumer  protection,  including  financial  literacy  and \ninclusion. The government aims to further reform, broaden, and deepen the finance sector. A \nspecific focus will be on improving access to financial services by individuals, and particularly \nthe poor.  ADB\u2019s assistance at this time is opportune.  \n \n5.  Each of the PRC\u2019s top four financial regulators was required by the central government \nto create individual units for financial consumer protection. The China Securities Regulatory \nCommission created one in December 2011, and China Insurance Regulatory Commission in \nNovember 2011, while the China Banking Regulatory Commission created a Banking Consumer \nProtection Bureau in 2012. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) created the Financial Consumer \nProtection Bureau (FCPB) in June 2012. Despite numerous entities being involved, an overall \nlegal framework and cooperation mechanism is lacking. Each entity is generally responsible for \nsupervision of financial consumer protection within  its own mandate. However, supervision \nresponsibilities of the FCPB and other entities are sometimes unclear; they either overlap or \nleave gaps. The legal basis and the scope of financial consumer rights are not clear enough for \n                                                \n1   The TA is included in ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. \nManila. \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 October 2013. \n ", "2   \nthe four regulators to properly oversee the rapidly expanding range of products and services in \nthe finance sector.  \n \n6.  Laws or regulations have not been enacted for financial consumer protection in the PRC. \nOnly selective parts of some existing laws relate indirectly to financial consumer protection. For \nexample, if there is conflict between consumers and financial institutions, it currently falls under \nthe Law of Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers enacted in 1993. However, the \nterm \u201cconsumer,\u201d as used in this law, is generally defined as someone consuming to support his \nor her livelihood. So, under the current law, small and medium-sized enterprises and retail \nclients obtaining loans for participation in a commercial activity (including farming) cannot have \ntheir rights effectively protected. Overall, this law does not contain sufficient details relating to \nfinancial consumer protection. There is significant debate over whether it should be applicable \nto conflicts between consumers and financial institutions. This law is currently being revised.   \n \n7.  The FCPB is charged with carrying out financial consumer protection work within the \nPBC\u2019s legal mandate of authorities. Applicable authorities for financial consumer protection \ninclude renminbi administration; financial market regulation, including foreign exchange and \ngold  markets;  administration  of  loans,  deposits,  bankcards  and  accounts;  payment  and \nsettlement systems; anti-money-laundering measures; and credit information systems. Some \nmunicipal and provincial governments have also initiated various financial consumer protection \nactivities despite the lack of legal clarity. Certain branches of PBC have additionally run pilot \nprojects in financial consumer protection since 2010, with some producing a marked effect.  \n \n8.  The TA will help promote the establishment of a coordinated and consistent financial \nconsumer protection framework in the PRC. It will ease dialogue between the various consumer \nprotection  entities  that  have  varying,  and  sometimes  overlapping,  authorities.  The  primary \noutput will be the creation of guidelines to support preparation of a guidance, law, or regulation \ngoverning the role of the FCPB in financial consumer protection. National workshops and initial \ncoordination meetings will foster the dialogue between pertinent agencies. The coordination \nmechanisms  will  support  interagency  discussion  and  possible  creation  of  agreements  that \ndelineate supervision responsibilities. An assessment of the gaps and overlaps in the current \nregulatory framework will be performed. An unequivocal definition of \u201cfinancial consumer\u201d will be \nestablished. An inventory of the most applicable financial products requiring coverage under \nfinancial consumer protection will be completed. This inventory will help define supervisory \nresponsibilities and gaps. Additionally, the results of pilot projects run in various PRC provinces \nby PBC branches will be used as empirical evidence to help tailor final recommendations.   \n \n9.  A  high-level  international  conference  is  planned  to  bring  international  and  domestic \nexperts on the topic into one forum to share best practices and help solidify the final approach. \nThe primary aim of this conference is to allow all agencies and stakeholders to uniformly \nunderstand the importance of the topic globally, its link to the successful development of the \nPRC financial system, and the need for harmonization between supervision authorities. The \nFCPB\u2019s  final  legal framework  is  expected to  define  and  integrate the functions  of  various \nregulatory authorities within the existing regulatory context. This will help bridge supervision \ngaps and allow other agencies to define their roles more cohesively. A knowledge product will \nbe produced that outlines the current state of financial consumer protection in the PRC and \nrecommendations for improvements. \n \n ", "  3 \n10.  The TA is closely aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, where finance has been identified \nas one of ADB\u2019s core areas of operations.3 In the country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe PRC, the first pillar is inclusive growth and improving access to finance.4 This TA supports \naccess to finance by aiding the development of a clearer policy framework for protection of \nconsumers as they use these products and services. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome  \n \n11.  The impact will be stronger protection of consumers of financial products and services. \nThe outcome will be a regulatory framework and cooperation mechanism for financial consumer \nprotection. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n12.  Three  main  TA  outputs  will  help  promote  a  coordinated  and  consistent  financial \nconsumer  protection  framework  in  the  PRC.  They  will  bolster  overall  financial  consumer \nprotection by ensuring that gaps and overlaps in supervision are minimized. The FCPB will \ndisseminate TA activities and serve as the center point for discussions across agencies and \nstakeholders. \n \n13.  The  first  output  will  include  a  review  of  domestic  conditions  and  practices  and  a \ncompilation of global best practices. The domestic review will assess gaps and overlaps in the \nexisting regulatory and supervision structure. It will make an inventory of financial consumer \nproducts and services. Additionally, the results of pilot projects run in various PRC regions by \nPBC branches will be gathered and evaluated.  \n \n14.  The  compilation  of  global  best  practices  will  cover  financial  consumer  protection \nlegislation and systems in relevant countries and regions. The TA will finance a study tour to the \nmost pertinent ADB member country in the region and also to the EU. The EU has been chosen \nbecause ADB considers that its framework for financial consumer protection, and its use of \ndirectives,  may  be  compatible  with  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  and  legal  system.  Current  global \nachievements and lessons learned in the field of financial consumer protection will be assessed. \nThis review will cover legal systems, information exchange, the concepts of financial consumer \nrights, and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. \n \n15.  The second output will be the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework for the \nFCPB\u2019s  financial  consumer  protection  and  supervision.  This  output  will  include  preparing \nrecommendations and drafting regulatory notes for the possible financial consumer protection \nschemes that may work best for the PRC, as well as discussing the role of the FCPB. The \nframework will consider the current legal system and the diverse role of national and provincial \nsupervisors. It will integrate the need for transparency, equal credit opportunity, alternative \ndispute  resolution  mechanisms,  and  financial  privacy  protection.  Recommendations  will  be \nmade on methods for interagency cooperation and the scope of issues each agency may cover. \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "4   \n16.  The third output will be the promotion of coordinated financial consumer protection in the \nPRC.  This  will  support  communication  between  the  various  entities  and  stakeholders  for \nfinancial  consumer  protection  in  the  PRC.  National  and  international  workshops  and \nconferences will be held and the TA results will be shared with the financial consumer protection \nunits in other regulatory agencies in the PRC. This will encourage coordination and enable \nagreements between agencies to further delegate and define their respective responsibilities. A \nnational workshop will be used to discuss current issues within the PRC and propose solutions.  \n \n17.  The aforementioned international conference (para. 9) will ensure that all agencies and \nstakeholders collectively understand the importance of the topic. It will show how financial \nconsumer protection links to the successful development of the PRC financial system, support \nfor  financial  inclusion,  and  the  need  for  harmonization  among  other  agencies  involved  in \nfinancial consumer protection. A knowledge product will be produced to describe the current \nissues  in  financial  consumer  protection  and  the  recommendations  made  for  the  overall \nframework. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $430,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and management \ntime, office space, remuneration, per diem of counterpart staff, other support costs required for \nproject management and consultant teams, full access to all materials required subject to proper \nconfidentiality, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n19.  The FCPB will be the executing agency and the implementing agency.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented from 15 November 2013 to 28 February 2015. The TA will \nrequire one international consultant for a total of 6 person-months, and one national consultant \nfor a total of 10 person-months.  \n \n21.  ADB will engage the international and national consultants, as well as any resource \npersons, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  proceeds  of  the  TA  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  An \nadvance payment facility will be used for training, seminar, and conference administration by the \nexecuting agency. \n \n22.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs as per the agreed timeline and budget. To support monitoring \nand evaluation, consultants will submit inception and interim reports. TA review missions will be \nused  to  aid  in monitoring  progress,  as  will  regular communication  with  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies and consultants. \n \n23.  The TA is based on the main assumption that good coordination will exist between the \nvarious  financial  consumer  protection  entities  established  by  the  PBC,  China  Banking \nRegulatory  Commission,  China  Securities  Regulatory  Commission,  and  China  Insurance \n ", "  5 \nRegulatory Commission. Another key assumption is that the TA team will be able to obtain and \ndraw upon any prior work by these agencies on financial consumer protection.  \n \n24.  The key risk is the inability to effectively delineate and clarify the respective authorities of \nall agencies concerned with consumer protection, and the resulting delay in mobilizing qualified \nconsultants. However, these risks will be partially mitigated by holding an inception coordination \nworkshop  between  the  agencies  to  plan  working  mechanisms,  share  information,  and \nencourage cooperation. The risks will also be mitigated by holding interim and final workshops \nwhere stakeholders and other agencies will be invited to jointly participate, and by ongoing \nmonitoring and close engagement between the FCPB, the consultants, and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Promotion of a Legal Framework for \nFinancial Consumer Protection, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nStronger protection  Efficient application of financial  FCPB, PBC, and PBC  Coordination between \nof consumers of  consumer protection  branches for baseline  the FCPB and the \nfinancial products  framework and mechanisms  data  various financial \nand services  by end of 2016    consumer protection \n    Final consultant report  entities established by \nreceived and accepted by  CBRC, CSRC, and \nthe FCPB  CIRC \n   \n  Risk \nInability to clearly \ndelineate and clarify \nrespective authorities of \nall  agencies concerned \nwith  financial \nconsumer protection \nOutcome      Assumption \nA regulatory  Financial consumer protection  FCPB, PBC, and PBC  FCPB commitment to \nframework and  framework of FCPB prepared  branches   serve as the center \ncooperation  and shared by end of 2015    point for agencies in \nmechanism for  Inception and interim  garnering a cooperative \nfinancial consumer  progress reports;  framework \nprotection   summary reports from   \ntraining and final  Risk \nworkshops   Inability to clearly \n  delineate and clarify \nFinal consultant report  respective authorities of \nreceived and accepted by  relevant agencies \nthe FCPB and final  regarding financial \nworkshop held  consumer protection \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
