THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Xi\u2019an Urban Road Network Improvement \nProject.1 \n \n2.  The project provides an opportunity for ADB to support sustainable urban transport \ndevelopment in the PRC. The project will finance investment in road network improvements, \npedestrian mobility and safety, multimodal interchange facilities, intelligent transport system \n(ITS), and low emissions fuelling infrastructure. To support this project, an ADB-financed project \npreparatory technical assistance2 was approved in 2009 to produce an agreed design and \nimplementation arrangements for an urban transport project suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Xi\u2019an, the provincial capital and economic and cultural center of Shaanxi Province, is one \nof the most important growth poles in the western region of the PRC. The city is expanding and \ndeveloping rapidly and 72% of its 8.4 million residents in 2009 were categorized as urban. The \nurban  population  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of  2.5%  during  2000\u20132009  and  the  city\u2019s  gross \ndomestic product rose by 13.5% per annum over the same period. With this growth has come a \nrapid expansion of motorized vehicle traffic, along with the urban transport problems this often \nbrings. On average, the number of vehicles registered in Xi\u2019an increased by 14.1% a year \nduring 2003\u20132007. Annual passenger vehicles growth was 21.8%.3 The city is experiencing \nworsening  traffic  congestion  and  its  strategic  road  network,  especially  the  arterial  roads \nnecessary  to  service  urban  expansion  between  its  Second  and  Third  ring  roads,  needs \ndevelopment to meet rising demand. The city\u2019s transport system is poorly integrated and does \nnot serve the needs of the entire community adequately or equitably. Roads are often unsafe for \npedestrians and bicyclists. Air quality is deteriorating as vehicle emissions grow.  \n4.  Xi\u2019an is trying to address these problems by expanding its road network and transport \ninfrastructure  and  services  with  its  own  financial  resources  and  support  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB)4 and the World Bank.5 These efforts have fallen short of what is \nneeded to meet the growing volume of travel within the city, however. Economic and population \ngrowth and overcrowding within the historic walled city have led to increasing demand for new \noffices, commercial space, and social infrastructure in urban growth poles beyond the central \narea in the band between the Second Ring Road and the Third Ring Road on the city\u2019s \nperiphery. The change in traffic patterns and surging transport requirements that have resulted \nfrom urban growth here, combined with limited existing connectivity, have created transport \nbottlenecks that could constrain the city\u2019s further economic growth and development. The city\u2019s \nmaster plan has identified the need to complete missing sections of its strategic road network to \nprovide access to these emerging growth poles and to do so in a way that serves the needs of \nall road users, including public and private transport modes and pedestrians. \n                                                      \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Xi\u2019an  Urban  Road  Network \nImprovement Project. Manila. \n3  China Statistics Press. 2007. Xi\u2019an Statistical Yearbook. PRC. \n4  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Xi\u2019an Urban Transport Project. Manila. \n5  World Bank. 2008. Project Appraisal Document: Xi\u2019an Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Washington, DC.  ", "2 \n5.  The city is finding it difficult to manage its overstretched transport system effectively. Its \ntraffic  control  center  primarily  covers  only  areas  inside  the  Second  Ring  Road  and  lacks \nequipment  in  the  new  areas  of  urban  growth  beyond.  This  results  in  (i)  poor  system \nmanagement,  (ii)  policing  and  enforcement  issues,  (iii)  conflict  between  vehicles  and \npedestrians, and (iv) a system that fails to give proper priority to public transport and emergency \nvehicles.  \n6.  A lack of suitable equipment, capacity, and enforcement has also left Xi\u2019an struggling in \nthe face of mounting traffic to regulate vehicle standards, driver behavior, and emissions. It \nneeds more equipment to check the city\u2019s motorized vehicle fleet for compliance with emissions \nstandards and to monitor and report on these emissions, as it is required to do by national law. \nGreater vehicle-related emissions now account for 50% of poor ambient air quality, highlighting \na need to develop the city\u2019s capacity to manage and police its traffic better. \n \n7.  To help address its transport challenges, Xi\u2019an is expanding its public transport network \nto provide a more balanced range of travel choices and limit reliance on private vehicles. Two \nsubway lines are under construction and four more are in development. The World Bank is \nsupporting the establishment of 13 bus priority corridors, primarily inside the Second Ring Road. \nPublic transport is made less attractive, however, by a lack of integration between its different \nmodes and by the poor standard of the public transport connections to the areas beyond the old \ncity center.  \n \n8.  Weaknesses in interagency coordination compound the city\u2019s urban transport problems. \nThey also contribute to the lack of integration between various modes of travel, especially \nbetween the public transport and the nonmotorized modes most used by the poor, who walk or \nuse bicycles for most of their trips.  \n \n9.  Addressing these complex, interrelated urban transport issues\u2014and others, such as the \ngrowing  number  of  vehicle  collisions\u2014will  require  a  concerted,  comprehensive  effort  over \nseveral  years.  The  Xi\u2019an  authorities  recognize  that  a  holistic  approach  that  can  balance \nconflicting pressures and demands is needed to provide solutions and build on the progress \nmade through earlier ADB and World Bank assistance (footnotes 4 and 5). Lessons from past \nassistance have been incorporated into the project design, notably the need for improved \ncoordination  between  line  agencies,  greater  emphasis  on  integrated  management  of  the \ntransport system, and timely approval of resettlement plans. \n \n10.  The project supports the PRC\u2019s search for suitable, sustainable solutions to its urban \ntransport problems and fits emerging urban priorities of its Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. \nIt is also focuses the key development agendas of inclusive and environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment  under  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  20206  and  aligns  with  the  proposed  PRC  country \npartnership strategy now being prepared. By addressing urban transport, it covers one of the \nfocus areas of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan.7  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be support for inclusive, environment-friendly economic growth in Xi\u2019an \nby  facilitating  the  movement  of  goods  and  people.  By  contributing  to  comprehensive \n                                                      \n6  ADB. 2008.

", "3 \nimprovement of integrated urban mobility and transport system management, the project will \nsupport the continued economic growth of the city. The outcome will be an efficient, safe, and \nenvironmentally sustainable integrated urban transport system developed in Xi\u2019an. \n \nC.  Outputs \n12.  The project will provide missing road links, improved interchanges, bus prioritization, \nnonmotorized  transport  routes,  better  pedestrian  safety,  multimodal  interchange  facilities, \nadvanced traffic management, and vehicle emission control strategies. This will support better \nroad use and transport access for all. The design and monitoring framework summarizes the \nmain features of the project (Appendix 1). The five project outputs are described below.  \n \n13.  Output 1: Road network improvements. Output 1 will construct and/or rehabilitate \n12.92 kilometers (km) of urban roads along Keji 2nd Road (6.2 km), Kunming Road (4.39 km), \nand Dazhai West Road (2.33 km) in the southwest part of the city. These roads will include \n21.57 km of bus priority corridors, 21.57 km of nonmotorized transport lanes, and a 4.2 km \nlinear green park along Kunming Road. This output will also include six urban interchanges of \nsuitable sizes and configurations at current critical bottlenecks on the road network. They will \nprovide sufficient access to the new urban growth centers between ring roads 2 and 3. The bus \npriority corridors will include lanes for the exclusive use of buses, traffic signals that give priority \nto bus transit, station improvements, and traffic management measures. They will significantly \nimprove travel conditions for bus passengers. The roads will include facilities for cyclists and \npedestrians as part of the project\u2019s aim to have street design and traffic operations cater to all \nroad users. The road network improvements will provide better links to the Second and Third \nring roads, making them more functional, and improve road connections between the city\u2019s new \ngrowth poles, the commercial business area in the southwest, and the government offices to the \nnorth. \n \n14.  Output 2: Pedestrian crossing and safety improvements. Output 2 will upgrade 110 \nurban intersections and 15 mid-block pedestrian crossing facilities, improving crossing signals \nand  visibility  and  safety  for  pedestrians.  Safety  equipment  using  advanced  information \ntechnology will be introduced and safety rules enforced. These improvements will promote the \nuse of nonmotorized transport, make it safer, and better serve low-income city residents who \nare unlikely to have access to private modes of transport and rely on walking or public transport. \nWomen pedestrians on domestic errands and children are expected to benefit in particular.  \n \n15.  Output 3: Multimodal interchange facilities. Output 3 will construct (i) four multimodal \ntransport hubs, (ii) five multilevel parking facilities, and (iii) five compressed natural gas (CNG) \nstations. The four transport hubs (Xi\u2019an North Train Station, Xi\u2019an National Civil Aerospace \nIndustrial Base, Xi\u2019an Yuhua Zhai, and Xi\u2019an International Logistics Park) will provide easy \nconnections between subway, bus, taxi, car, motorcycle, and bicycle travel. The hubs will thus \nlink other transport modes from and to the surrounding areas with key public transport routes \nand provide staging and control facilities for public transport vehicles. The five multilevel parking \nfacilities will provide off-street parking for 2,249 vehicles and for motorcycles and bicycles. Two \nwill be built at the multimodal interchange facilities for Xi\u2019an Yuhua Zhai and Xi\u2019an International \nLogistics Park to promote modal interchange and the use of public transport. Three parking \ngarages will be located on the edge of the old walled city (Leju Chang, South Guoshang Village, \nand Xizhan Community). This will help manage traffic demand by allowing motorized vehicle \nusers to park outside the city wall instead of driving into the congested central part of the city. \nThe parking subcomponent will also provide parking management and enforcement on the \nstreets  around  the  parking  structures  and  address  the  serious  issue  of  illegal  parking  on \n ", "4 \nsidewalks. One CNG station will be incorporated into each of the project multimodal interchange \nfacilities and the fifth will be established close to the Third Ring Road at Mujiangwang. They will \nprovide efficient fueling for buses, taxis, and private vehicles and encourage further switching to \nthis  more  environmentally  sustainable  fuel  source.  Electric  charging  stations  will  also  be \nprovided at the multimodal interchange facilities to service the expected growth in electric \nvehicles and an existing large fleet of electric motorcycles.  \n \n16.  Output 4: Intelligent transport system and road user safety program. Output 4 will \nextend the coverage of the existing ITS to the Third Ring Road and the urban growth poles it \nserves. It will also develop an implementation plan for improving the use and management of \nthe ITS; improve traveler information dissemination for both private and public transport modes; \nand implement a road safety education program to support the pedestrian crossing safety \nproject output, including toolkits, training materials, and safety campaigns targeted at such \nvulnerable road users as children and the elderly. This output includes capacity development to \nmore effectively operate the ITS to achieve improved control of traffic and pedestrian crossings, \nas well as information dissemination and policing and enforcement. The output will include 20 \nvariable traffic message signs, 140 microwave detectors, 66 closed-circuit televisions, 31 red-\nlight cameras, and 10 speed violation cameras.  \n \n17.  Output 5: Environmental protection enhancement. Output 5 will enhance the vehicle \nemissions  inspection  program  by  providing  random  inspection  capacity  and  five emission \nregulation enforcement vehicles, 10 black smoke stations, and four pieces of mobile emission \nenforcement  equipment.  It  will  also  improve  air  quality  monitoring  by  establishing  four \nmonitoring substations along the Third Ring Road equipped with air quality and noise monitoring \nsystems connected to the environment information center and a remote sensing data receiving \nsystem  to  provide  city  wide  air  quality  status  in  the  city.  It  will  establish  a  computerized \nenvironment and vehicle emission information-sharing system, an emission regulation violation \nsystem,  public  sector  vehicle  management,  obsolete  vehicle  scrapping  enforcement \nadministration assistance, and a system for environmental information disclosure. It will also set \nup an environmental information center. The city government is committed to raising the number \nof days each year that it records air quality better than grade II8 to more than 300 by reducing \nthe emission of pollutants by industry, households, and vehicles. This output will help achieve \nthat  commitment  by  supporting  more  effective  management  and  enforcement  of  vehicle \nstandards.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n18.  The  project  is  estimated  to  cost  $558.06  million  (including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$17.54 million). The government requested a loan of $150 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to finance 26.9% of the project cost. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and \nsuch terms and conditions as may be set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. ADB\u2019s \nloan  will  cover  civil  works,  equipment,  project  management  consulting  services,  capacity \nbuilding,  the  road user safety program,  and taxes and duties  on the expenditures  financed by \n                                                      \n8  Grade II is defined as ambient air quality suitable for residential, commercial, education, general industrial, and \nfarming areas.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n23.  The  capacity  of  XMG  to  deliver  and  in  the  operation  of  the  project  is  considered \nadequate to implement the project\u2019s advanced technical aspects, based on its performance on \nsuch  aspects  in  the  past.  These  aspects  relate  to  the  multimodal  transport  facilities,  ITS, \npedestrian safety, and environment outputs, as well as capacity and stakeholder involvement in \nsystem operations and road safety. The project is technically viable with technology choices \nbased on efficient and proven designs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n24.  The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 22.6% and net present value of CNY2,896.9 million discounted at 12%. The estimate \ncovered all five outputs for the period 2011\u20132035. The estimated costs include investment in \ncivil  works  and  equipment,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement,  and  periodic  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M). The estimated benefits include normal, generated, and diverted traffic and \ninclude savings in vehicle operating cost, travel time, and reductions in road accidents and \nemissions. Sensitivity analysis produced a favorable EIRR after tests assuming cost overruns \nand benefit reductions and showed that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust.  \n \n25.  The  project  has  both  revenue  and  nonrevenue  components.  The  nonrevenue \ncomponents include road network improvements, ITS upgrades, pedestrian crossing and safety \nimprovements, environmental protection enhancement, and multimodal transport facilities. The \ntwo revenue-generating components consist of (i) the five CNG fueling stations, and (ii) the five \nparking facilities, which also include some revenue-producing retail space. The total estimated \n ", "8 \ncost for the CNG stations is CNY62.6 million. O&M is estimated at CNY12.9 million (CNY12.3 \nmillion after subtracting depreciation) per annum and is assumed to increase with inflation. The \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the CNG stations component is 3.8%, which is higher \nthan the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 1.6%. The financial net present value at \nthis WACC is CNY15.6 million. The CNG stations are considered financially feasible. The total \nestimated cost of the five multilevel parking structures is CNY137.2 million. Annual O&M is \nestimated at CNY12.6 million (CNY7.3 million after subtracting depreciation) at the start of \noperation. The FIRR for the parking component is 3.2%, which is higher than the WACC of \n1.6%. The financial net present value at this WACC is CNY35.5 million. The multilevel parking \ngarages are considered financially feasible. \n26.  Annual debt service and O&M are forecast to be about 0.5% of the XMG\u2019s projected \nannual revenues in 2016 and to decline thereafter. Fiscal revenues of the municipal government \nwill  grow  in  line  with  economic  development,  providing  more  resources  for  the  municipal \ngovernment to finance the proposed project components. O&M and debt service for the project \nwill account for about 3.4% of the Xi\u2019an Infrastructure Investment Group\u2019s projected revenues in \n2016 and will decline thereafter. This is considered adequate for the proposed loan. \n \nC.  Governance  \n27.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). The relevant sections of \nthe ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) will be included in all procurement \ndocument and contracts. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the \nGovernment  of  the  PRC,  the  XMG,  the  executing  agency  (including  the  PMO),  and  the \nimplementing agency, including the project implementing unit. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  A poverty and social assessment has been carried out in accordance with the ADB \nHandbook on Social Analysis.11 The assessment indicated that the project will contribute directly \nand indirectly to poverty reduction in Xi\u2019an through the creation of an estimated 700 temporary \njob-years for construction and 300 permanent jobs for operation of the project outputs. Indirect \nbenefits will accrue from lower health costs associated with reductions in vehicular emissions, \nroad accidents, and travel times. It is envisaged that the project\u2019s largest impact will be the \nsocial benefits of making greater convenient, affordable, and safe transport options available in \na  more  equitable  way  for  all  road  users,  including  women,  children,  the  elderly,  and  the \ndisabled. Dedicated PMO staff will be responsible for implementation and monitoring of a social \naction plan that has been developed on the basis of the assessment\u2019s findings.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n29.  Environment. The project is classified under environment category A. In compliance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), an environmental impact assessment (EIA) was \ndisclosed on ADB\u2019s website on 24 June 2011 and prepared using (i) feasibility study reports, \n(ii) applicable PRC laws and requirements, and (iii) a cultural relic survey report. The major \npotential environmental impacts involve emissions and noise from the increases in vehicle fleet \nsize during the operational period. The project will address this through vehicle inspection and \n                                                      \n11 ADB. 2007. Handbook on Social Analysis. Manila. ", "9 \nenforcement of vehicle emission standards, as well as such mitigation measures as noise \nbarrier  installation  where  noise  levels  exceed  standards  defined  in  the  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP). While no significant impacts are predicted on cultural relic sites, \nvibration and dust will be closely monitored at the sites during construction, a cultural relic \nexpert will be engaged by the implementing agency, and the chance finds procedures as \ndefined in the EMP will be followed. \n30.  XMG will be required to observe the EIA and EMP and experience from past ADB \nprojects indicate that it has the capacity to properly execute the plans. To ensure all potential \nadverse  environmental  impacts  of  the  project  are  mitigated,  the  implementing  agency  will \nimplement the EMP as specified in the EIA. The EMP will be incorporated in the bidding \ndocuments and contracts for civil works and monitored through semiannual reports submitted to \nADB. A grievance redress mechanism has been developed, details of which are provided in the \nEIA.12 \n \n31.  Resettlement. The project is classified as category A for involuntary resettlement. The \nproject will acquire 58.67 hectares (ha) of state-owned land. It will also acquire about 46.5 ha of \ncollective land, of which 10.2 ha (22%) is classified as cultivated. A total of 73,350 square \nmeters  (m2)  of  residential  housing  and  267,257  m2  of  buildings  used  by  institutions  and \nenterprises will be demolished. The permanent land acquisition and house demolition required \nwill affect 277 households and 9,576 people, including staff and workers. No land external to the \nproject construction sites will be required for temporary use during construction. \n \n32.  The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is CNY993 million. The executing agency \nhas assured ADB that adequate counterpart funding will be made available for land acquisition \nand resettlement, in line with the annual funding requirements stipulated in the resettlement \nplan. Resettlement implementation will be monitored both internally and externally. Experience \nfrom past ADB projects indicates that the executing agency has the institutional capacity to \ncarry out the plan effectively. The PMO's land acquisition and resettlement unit will coordinate \ninternal supervision and reporting of plan implementation with the relevant local government \nagencies. The executing agency will engage an external institute for semiannual monitoring and \nreporting. The executing agency will finance all of the monitoring costs from their counterpart \nfunds. The monitoring details and costs are included in the resettlement plan.  \n \n33.  Indigenous peoples. As Han Chinese, who makes up the PRC\u2019s majority ethnic group, \ncomprises 99% of Xi\u2019an\u2019s population, the project is classified under category C. The remaining \n1% of the city\u2019s residents is mostly Hui but no intrinsic difference exists in the way the project \nwill affect the two ethnic groups. Both will benefit. No construction activities will occur near a \nmosque, the most common place of religious worship for the predominantly Muslim Hui. No \nethnic minority people have been identified whose assets will be adversely affected by the \nproject. Measures to enhance the participation of the city\u2019s Hui people are included in the social \naction plan. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the assessment and risk management plan.13 \n \n                                                      \n12 Environmental Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures\nWeak project coordination between the  The risk will be mitigated through the project leading group, which will \nPMO, executing agency, and  coordinate among various agencies and appropriate actions. \nimplementing agency \nPoor integration of land use and transport  The project is designed to improve transport mode connectivity and \nconnection to local areas through multimodal interchange hubs. \nDelays in the provision of counterpart  The risk will be mitigated through covenanted assurances from local \nfunding, particularly for the road  governments for timely provision of counterpart funding and direct \nsubcomponents   PMO coordination with them. \nLack of long-term commitment to  The risk will be mitigated through significant long-term capacity \nsustainable operation and maintenance   building in urban infrastructure maintenance agencies. \nLimited promotion of safe and inclusive  The project will provide demonstration and capacity development to \ntransport modes  ensure safe and inclusive sustainable transport delivery. \nChance encounters with archeological  Project monitoring procedures will ensure that any cultural or \nremains during construction, given that  archeological remains will be properly handled and preserved. \nXi\u2019an is a city of historical significance \nDelays in approval of resettlement plans,  Processing schedules and timing of approvals will be monitored to \nleading to delays in project activities  avoid delays. \nIncreases in land values resulting in a  Discussions have been held with the government on this issue and \ncost overrun for resettlement  provisions for additional finances, if required, are being sought by the \nXi\u2019an Municipal Government.  \nPMO = project management office.  \nSources: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n35.
