INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has had devastating health, social, economic, and \nfinancial impacts across the world. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that the global \noutput losses in 2020 can reach $4.1 trillion.1 On 13 April 2020, ADB announced a $20 billion \npackage consisting of loans, grants, and technical assistance (TA) to help its developing member \ncountries (DMCs) in Asia and the Pacific manage the wide-ranging consequences of COVID-19. \nAs part of this package, ADB is working with several DMCs in Southeast Asia to formulate their \nimmediate responses to COVID-19 and provide financial support for the health and fiscal stimulus \nrequirements.2 The  proposed  regional  knowledge  and  support  TA  will  play  a  critical  and \ncomplementary role to ADB\u2019s lending assistance in two ways.3  \n \n2.  First, the TA will help the Southeast Asian DMCs that have received loans under ADB\u2019s \nCOVID-19 Pandemic Response Option (CPRO) and ADB to monitor the implementation of the \nCOVID-19 response packages and provide updates to policy makers and stakeholders. The basis \nfor this will be the Country Engagement Framework (CEF) prepared by ADB and tailored for each \nDMC as part of the relevant CPRO loan.4 Second, the TA will help Southeast Asian DMCs return \nto their pre-COVID-19 economic performance as quickly as possible. It will also help them be \nmore prepared for any national, regional, or global transformation that may take place post-\nCOVID-19.  Specifically,  the  TA  will  lead  the  formulation  and  implementation  of  COVID-19 \nrecovery strategies, policies, and plans through in-depth analysis, stakeholder consultations, and \nhigh-level policy advice. Table 1 presents an illustrative set of issues that DMCs and countries \naround the world are grappling with, which will be covered under the TA. The timelines in Table \n1 are subject to change and ultimately will be determined by the epidemiological pathways of \nCOVID-19 across the DMCs and elsewhere. \n \n3.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s comprehensive response to the COVID-19 pandemic.5 ADB \nhas supported efforts to strengthen national and regional health systems through several TA \nprojects and other projects. The TA will complement those initiatives by supporting DMCs\u2019 efforts \nto bounce back their economies.6 The TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational priorities of \naddressing poverty, reducing inequalities, accelerating progress on gender equality, and fostering \nregional cooperation and integration.7  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Flattening the pandemic curve and saving lives have been top priorities in all \nSoutheast Asian countries (Phase 1, Table 1). To contain COVID-19, most countries have \nresorted to social distancing and large-scale community quarantine measures. All countries have \nalso increased their budgetary allocations to the health sector and enacted emergency measures \nto set up COVID-19 treatment facilities supplemented by increased testing programs. ADB\u2019s \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Asian Development Outlook 2020: What Drives Innovation in Asia?

Flattening the recession curve has already become a major concern (Phase 2, Table \n1). In the short term of about 2-6 months after the onset of the pandemic, there is a clear trade-\noff between flattening the pandemic curve and flattening the recession curve.9 While the world \nhas not had a pandemic of this scale since the 1918 influenza pandemic, there is a common \nrecognition that restarting economies may be much harder than shutting them down. In many \ncountries, there are serious concerns that the severity of the economic decline may undo the \ngains made in poverty reduction, job creation, and infrastructure development. Many DMCs have \nrisen to the challenge and have introduced large fiscal stimulus packages that acknowledge the \ndifferent socioeconomic and health impacts experienced by men and women. The rapid response \nof ADB and other development partners will provide governments with some of the financial \nresources needed to mitigate the immediate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak (footnote 5). \n \n8  ADB.

Mitigating the COVID Economic Crisis: Act Fast and Do Whatever It Takes. \nLondon. \n \n ", "3 \nAlongside increases in health budgets, cash transfer programs are in place in many countries, \nrecognizing the heightened risks of intergenerational poverty stemming from the COVID-19 \npandemic. Governments have provided enterprises with temporary liquidity support to maintain \npayrolls and partly compensate workers. Central banks and financial regulators have put in place \nsupportive measures to ease the financial burden on micro, small and medium enterprises \n(MSMEs), large corporates, and banks. The private sector and philanthropic organizations have \nsprung to action to provide short-term relief. For the next 3\u20136 months, implementation of the policy \nresponses must be carefully monitored in line with the CEFs in CPROs for COVID-19 response, \nparticularly the measures adopted to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on the poor and vulnerable, \nwomen, children, elderly, and people with disabilities. A TA project is also being prepared to \nrespond to the gendered impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including support for the heightened \nincidence of domestic and/or gender-based violence. \n \n6.  In parallel, countries need to plan for fuller recovery and near-term positioning \n(Phase 2, Phase 3, Table 1). Until the end of 2019, the Southeast Asian region had registered \nrobust economic growth despite global uncertainties. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has \ndrastically changed the economic outlook for all countries. The assessment of the International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s chief economist is that the \u201cGreat Lockdown\u201d will lead globally to the \u201cworst \neconomic downturn since the Great Depression.\u201d10 Building on the wide-ranging measures taken \nby countries, the next phase must focus on helping the Southeast Asian economies bounce back \ntoward full recovery. There is much debate about a V-shaped versus U-shaped recovery, with \nmany betting on a V-shaped recovery. Yet, the experience of past crises suggests that business \nand consumer confidence and capital investment may take time to recover. Governments will \nneed to step in with strong policy measures to restore confidence, without crowding out the private \nsector. Social protection may need to continue, while manufacturing, construction, and services \nsectors may need further support. The need and value of data have never been so critical as now. \nMany DMCs struggle with proper identification of poor and vulnerable households, including \ntracking the contribution of the informal sector, own-account workers, and unpaid family labor in \noverall economic output. The labor market participation of women and youth will be an important \nconsideration for government and private sector skills training and financial support programs as \ngovernments seek to be rebuild their economies. Through careful design of policy packages, there \nis an opportunity to promote gender equality, unpack stereotypes affecting employment decision-\nmaking, and break the cycle of intergenerational poverty across our DMCs.  \n \n7.  The COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to bring about transformational \nchanges (Phase 3, Table 1). In addition to all these near-term considerations, COVID-19 will \ncertainly usher in a \u201cnew normal.\u201d11 One major concern in some DMCs is that 1\u20132 years of \ndrastically slower growth may completely alter their aspirations for medium- to long-term growth \nand  prosperity.  In  general,  there  is  also  a  concern  about  the  speed  of  revival  of  capital \nexpenditures,  particularly  for  infrastructure  development.  Another  factor  is  how  national \nsentiments and incentives will evolve partly as a reflection of the government\u2019s response to the \npandemic and a member\u2019s position in the regional or global economic architecture. For instance, \nSoutheast Asian DMCs have been quite well-integrated into regional and global value and supply \n \n10  G. Gopinath. 2020.

It is quite likely that those arrangements may \nbe tested in the coming months and possibly years. Governments that adopt a holistic and \ninclusive approach to supporting human capital development may empower men and women of \nall ages and abilities to engage in national socioeconomic recovery.  \n \n8.  In this regard, a special dimension in the recovery process is the scope for regional \ncooperation and integration (RCI). Some of the long-standing RCI initiatives were born in the \nSoutheast Asian region. That spirit of cooperation continues to remain strong. On 14 April 2020, \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders had a virtual summit where they \nagreed to work together closely to combat COVID-19 and committed to collective actions to \nmitigate the economic and social impact of the crisis.12 It is critical to fully sustain the spirit of RCI \nin the recovery and any transformation process, and to continuously share information on national \npolicy responses with a view to harmonizing them and facilitating learning. The national economic \nrecovery  and  transformation  strategies  must  incorporate  emerging  regional  and  global \nimperatives and priorities. The Southeast Asian DMCs have much to gain by taking coordinated \nactions to ensure that adequate complementarities continue to exist among the economies.  \n \n9.  On these fronts, timely and well-structured advice will be needed to guide the region\u2019s \npolicy makers to implement the necessary measures for economic recovery. Given the great \ndiversity across the Southeast Asian economies, the recovery plans will have to be inclusive and \ntailored to the countries\u2019 specific circumstances. A few crosscutting issues and themes will need \nto be incorporated into the assessments as well as the recovery and transformation strategies: \n(i)  alignment with a country\u2019s own circumstances, priorities, aspirations, and needs; \n(ii)  protecting and strengthening the resilience of the poor and vulnerable, including \nwomen and children; \n(iii)  challenging gender-based stereotypes related to human capital development to \nmaximize labor market participation for men and women in all sectors; \n(iv)  creating  positive  enabling  environments  for  good  governance,  private  sector \nparticipation, and RCI; \n(v)  incorporating  lessons  learned  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  while  reflecting \nreadiness for other disasters and crises; \n(vi)  adequate regard for climate change, greening, and sustainability considerations; \n(vii)  learning good practices and approaches from other countries\u2014either peers at the \nsame level of development or more/less advanced countries; and \n(viii)  creating  avenues  for  partnerships  and  cooperation  (e.g.  between  countries, \nstates/cities, and institutions) to strengthen preparedness for future challenges. \n \nIII.

Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Support for effective implementation of CPRO loans provided. The TA will \nsupport the implementation of the CPRO loans, as well as guide DMCs in formulating forward-\nlooking plans. Both aspects of the TA will be coordinated by ADB, in close consultation with the \ngovernments. Tasks relating to the CEF will be supported by a team of individual consultants in \neach DMC with a CPRO loan. The CPRO monitoring will largely cover Phase 1 in Table 1 and  \nwill be closely aligned with the CEFs for each CPRO loan, with the main purpose of monitoring \nthe inclusive implementation of the stimulus packages, undertaking private sector and civil society \nconsultations, and assessing data quality and reliability to aid in key priorities such as social \nprotection.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Incisive assessments and analysis undertaken of the impact of COVID-19 \nand the policy measures. This output will seek to understand the pathways of the COVID-19 \npandemic\u2019s impact on the real, financial, and external sectors of selected Southeast Asian DMCs. \nWhile the approach and focus may vary across the DMCs, all assessments will include: (i) health \nand social aspects, with particular emphasis on the poor and vulnerable and due attention given \nto the specific gender impacts of COVID-19; (ii) the key economic drivers and principal sub-\nsectors in each country, including consideration of labor market segmentation and how to support \nequitable and inclusive human capital development throughout the recovery phase; (iii) national, \nregional, and global value chain considerations; (iv) the role of MSMEs and large corporate \nentities; and (v) overall real-financial sector linkages. The assessments will also include a review \nof the existing support mechanisms and rapid response measures that were put in place by \ngovernments to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Examples include support to specific sectors \n(e.g.  tourism,  retail,  and  agriculture),  cash  transfers  to  poor  and  vulnerable  households, \nunemployment benefits, or tax benefits for MSMEs. Under the proposed TA, ADB will engage the \nservices of a leading consulting firm or firms with expertise in formulating economic recovery or \ntransformational plans to prepare the analyses and assessments related to this output. The \nconsulting firm or firms will be requested to provide their services in a cost-effective manner. Their \nwork will also contribute to output 4, with a supportive role for output 3.  \n \n13.  Output 3: Policy consultations with senior officials held to guide the formulation of \nrecovery and transformational strategies and plans. ADB will convene a high-level experts \npanel of globally well-known health experts, economists, social policy experts, and finance \nprofessionals to provide high-level advice to ministers and senior officials to guide the formulation \nof the recovery and transformational plans. ADB\u2019s Vice-President for Operations Group 2 will \nconvene the experts panel, with an ADB staff team acting as the secretariat. A number of high-\nlevel consultative sessions will be organized by ADB, involving ministers, secretaries, senior \nofficials, and the experts panel. The purpose of the consultations will be to guide the formulation \nof inclusive and equitable recovery strategies and plans. The panel may also articulate the types \nof transformational changes that may be triggered by the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe arrangements will be flexible, subject to the availability of the ministers and the experts panel. \n \n14.  Output 4: Recovery and transformational strategies and action plans formulated. \nThere will be two sets of documents produced under output 4. First, based on the deliberations \nunder output 3 and their expertise at global, regional, and national levels, a few selected members \nof the experts panel may be invited by ADB to draft advisory notes or papers and conduct \npresentations outlining their recommendations for the approaches that selected Southeast Asian \n \n ", "6 \ncountries, as well as the region, can adopt to navigate the post-COVID-19 world. The focus will \nbe on the types of issues highlighted in Table 1 and paras. 4\u20137 (but not limited to those). \nFurthermore, depending on the expert\u2019s focus, each member of the panel will also provide insights \ninto his or her specialized area of expertise, while commenting on any other aspects of the \nrecovery and transformation process. Indicative areas of specialized expertise are: (i) health \npolicy;  (ii)  social  protection  for  poor  and  vulnerable  groups;  (iii)  unpacking  labor  market \nsegmentation to maximize inclusive human capital development; (iv) value chains and trade; (v) \ncorporate recovery and restructuring, and financial sector impact; (vi) support to MSMEs; (vii) \nfiscal policy; and (viii) big data and new technologies.  \n \n15.  For the second set of documents produced under output 4, building on their work under \noutput  2  and  deliberations  under  output  3,  the  consulting  firm  or  firms  will  produce  a \ncomprehensive, inclusive, and equitable COVID-19 recovery bounce back strategy and action \nplan for selected countries. After consideration by the ADB team, the strategies and action plans \nwill be shared with each government, as inputs to national strategies.  \n \n16.  Output  5:  RCI  implications  and  knowledge  sharing  among  Southeast  Asian \ncountries distilled.
