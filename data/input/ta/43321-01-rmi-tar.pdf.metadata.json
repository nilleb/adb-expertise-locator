INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the reconnaissance mission fielded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nDecember 2009, the Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) requested ADB \nto provide a policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to be piggybacked to the Public \nSector Program (the Program)1 to address key policy concerns and capacity constraints. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The RMI Finance Minister has underlined the need to improve fiscal management. There \nare continued weaknesses in public expenditure management, particularly due to the rising \nwage bill. Until recently, public service reform has been a low priority on the agenda of the \ngovernment.  Against  soaring  public  expenditures,  government\u2019s  revenue  performance  has \nremained weak, aggravated by a non-compliance rate of 30-40% in tax payments. Enforcement \nof existing tax laws is still limited.  As a result, the government\u2019s contribution to the Compact \nTrust Fund, that is intended to generate a revenue stream that can replace United States \nCompact grants in FY2024, has been below required levels. In addition, the management of the \nstate-owned enterprises (SOEs) has been poor with most incurring operational losses and \nrequiring  large  government  subsidies.  The  Marshalls  Energy  Company  (MEC)  faces  many \noperational deficiencies in power generation, distribution, oil storage and trading. It also has \nproblems with financial management with regard to collection efficiency, system loss, debt \nmanagement and payroll. MEC has to find ways to reduce and eventually eliminate government \ntransfers and subsidies and reduce its current balance of commercial debt.     \n \n3.  There is lack of harmony between economic planning and statistics management and \nbudget formulation and execution. The medium-term budget and investment framework needs \nto be revised and expanded to cover key ministries. Annual and medium-term budgets have to \nbe  linked  directly  to  the  goals  and  objectives  of  the longer-term  planning  framework.  The \nmanagement of statistics has to be consolidated and integrated to provide timely and reliable \ninputs into the planning, budgeting and monitoring and evaluation processes. This will require a \nreview of the current fragmented institutional framework with a view to enhancing economic \npolicy, planning, and statistics by incorporating the Economic Policy, Planning and Statistics \nOffice  (EPPSO)  into  the  Finance  Ministry  to  merge  fiscal  and  economic  planning  and \nmanagement.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n4.  The TA is consistent with the ADB\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan 2010-20122 and \nthe Pacific Strategy 2010-2014.3 In addressing the binding development constraints in the \ncountry, the TA seeks to incorporate ADB's Approach to Engaging with Weakly Performing \nCountries.4 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  This is a piggybacked TA and the impact and the outcome of the TA are the same as \nthose of the Program. The impact of the Program will be a more efficient and effective public \n                                                 \n1  The proposed Program is scheduled for Board consideration on 17 August 2010.   \n2  ADB.  2010.
