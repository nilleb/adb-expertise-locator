Since 2004, the reform process in Uzbekistan has focused on strengthening public \nsector resource management and effectiveness. A key component of the reform agenda is to \nachieve effective management of investments and reforms in basic education, including raising \nthe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  investment  projects  financed  by  external  development \npartners. Moving forward, the Ministry of Public Education (MOPE) wishes to create a Center for \nEffective Management of Investments and Reforms in Basic Education. The Center\u2019s mandate \nis to achieve significantly improved management of investments and reforms in basic education, \nespecially with respect to externally funded investment projects, and coordination among aid \nagencies, and between MOPE and other government ministries and agencies. Support for this \ngovernment initiative is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) sector strategy in \nbasic education\u2014that of building national capacity for managing reforms and investments in key \nareas of need. The support is also consistent with ADB\u2019s firm commitment to helping Uzbekistan \nto achieve better results through more integrated and results-oriented working practices in \naccordance with the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. During fact-finding for the technical \nassistance (TA) conducted in October 2005, the impact, outcome, outputs, cost and financing, \nmain activities, and implementation arrangements were agreed upon with MOPE.1  Major aid \nagencies were consulted during TA preparation, including presentation at an aid coordination \nmeeting in August 2005 where funding agencies support for the TA was received. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Improving  Effectiveness  in  Aid  Coordination  and  Project  Implementation \nArrangements. To implement the National Program for Basic Education Development (NPBED) \n2004\u20132009,  the  Government  will  receive  about  $240  million  from  multilateral  and  bilateral \ndevelopment partners during that period.2 This significant increase in funding from external \ndevelopment partners compared with the past will place a high demand on the Government,  \nparticularly MOPE, to effectively manage projects and coordinate aid for maximum effectiveness. \nTo address the challenge, MOPE will need to develop effective institutional mechanisms for (i) \nensuring that funding agencies complement each other in assistance and avoid overlapping and \nduplication  of  efforts;  and  (ii)  exercising  effective  long-term  leadership  in  planning  and \nimplementing external assistance.  \n \n3.     ADB  is  the  lead  funding  agency  in  basic  education  with  one  investment  project \nsuccessfully completed, one program loan and two project loans under implementation, and a \nproject on  information and communications technology in basic education approved in 2005 for \nimplementation  in  2006.3 Establishing  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  for  each  project \nstaffed primarily with personnel from outside MOPE have been the usual arrangements. Given \nthe weakness in implementation capacity, such arrangements have been necessary, and have \ncontributed to the timeliness and effectiveness of project implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 20 October 2005. \n2  The total funding for NPBED is $1.2 billion of which the financing gap of $240 million is to be filled from external \nsources.    \n3  ADB. 1997.

However, with the increasing presence of funding agencies and a rising number of \nprojects under implementation in basic education,4 the parallel existence of independent PIUs \nwill require enhanced coordination among themselves and with departments of MOPE. There \nare  also  shortcomings  in  MOPE\u2019s  capacity  (manpower  and  experience)  for  overall  project \nmanagement.  Thus,  the  likely  results  are  overlap  and  duplication  of  functions  and \nresponsibilities, and hence inefficient use of resources and ineffective project implementation. \nSecond, the management and implementation capacity normally developed within individual \nPIUs is not being transferred to mainstream MOPE departments, nor do such implementation \narrangements encourage the growth of institutional memory or build up capacity within MOPE. \nConsequently, the capacity and expertise developed within a PIU is often lost once the project is \ncompleted. Third, the temporary nature of the PIUs is not conducive to systematic analysis of \nresults and consideration of longer term outcomes beyond the immediate project horizon.  \n \n5.   Improving  Coordination  within  MOPE  and  with  External  Partners.  Improving \ninformation flows and communication among the PIUs, and between the PIUs and departments \nof MOPE is necessary to achieve effective coordination and strengthen effectiveness in project \nimplementation and MOPE\u2019s daily activities. MOPE will also need to improve information flows \nand internal coordination among its different departments. While the departments are primarily \nconcerned  with  their  own  priorities  and  direct  tasks,  better  information  exchange  and \nunderstanding  of  individual  project  objectives  and  activities  will  help  in  achieving  effective \ncooperation and in determining larger priorities of MOPE and thus improve MOPE\u2019s ability to \nmanage and implement the reform program. Better coordination between MOPE and other \nministries/agencies  also  needs  to  be  achieved.  Effective  management  of  large  investment \nprojects and complex reform programs requires proactive cooperation and coordination with a \nnumber of ministries/agencies to ensure successful planning and implementation. The Center \nwill be required to ensure good information flow and effective dialogue among all involved \nparties within MOPE and with other government agencies. \n \n6.  The main purpose of the Center is to rationalize project implementation and ensure \ncapacity  building  and  institutional  memory  by  mainstreaming  operational  and  management \nexpertise within the wider MOPE structure, rather than relying on project-specific but temporary \nPIUs. By reducing transaction costs and increasing efficiency, the Center will help create the \nconditions necessary for enhanced development results in the basic education sector. MOPE\u2019s \nultimate goal is for project implementation to become part of its normal business. However, \nreaching  this  long-term  objective  will  require  a  gradual  process  of  transition  because  (i) \ndeveloping necessary institutions (the Center) and capacity take time, (ii) a range of human \nresources issues related to staff capabilities and incentives need to be addressed, and (iii) hasty \nmerging of PIUs may have a negative impact on project implementation.  \n \n7.  The capacity-building process will have two phases. Appendix 2 illustrates the phases. \nDuring the first phase where the Center will be established and become operational, its main \nfunction is coordination with a view to improving project implementation and aid coordination. \nDuring the second phase, MOPE is committed to integrating the PIUs and developing the \nCenter as an integral part of its organization structure. MOPE through the Center will carry out \nproject implementation as part of its activities and will effectively coordinate external support \nand assistance at both the strategic and activity levels. The TA will help MOPE initiate this \nprocess and will support the first phase of transition. More broadly, the TA will help build a solid \n                                                 \n4  The World Bank is processing its first investment loan for basic education to the Republic of Uzbekistan for \napproval in 2005.  \n \n ", "  3\nfoundation for moving toward a program-based or sectorwide approach in basic education in the \nfuture. A key constraint at present is the lack of institutional capacity in MOPE to lead and \nmanage such an approach. The TA will contribute to mitigating the constraint.  \n \n8.  Lessons Learned. ADB has provided two TAs for capacity building in the education \nsector in Uzbekistan.5 Both have played a key role in establishing ADB\u2019s lead position in policy \ndialogue with the Government, and in helping shape the Government\u2019s reform program in basic \neducation. A key lesson learned is to avoid overly ambitious goals and to base achievable \nresults on the Executing Agency\u2019s absorptive capacity, giving due consideration to the broader \ninstitutional context. The proposed TA (i) is the result of MOPE\u2019s initiative, (ii) focuses on the \nfirst stage of transition, and (iii) is simple in design. These features will better the prospect of \nsuccess and allow flexibility during implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will contribute to improved effectiveness and efficiency in planning, managing \nand implementing investments and reforms in the education sector in Uzbekistan. The outcome \nof the TA will be MOPE\u2019s improved capacity to manage investments and reforms in basic \neducation.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, April 2006\u2013April 2008, and will produce three \nmajor outputs: (i) the Center, established and operational; (ii) MOPE\u2019s capacity developed for \neffective management, implementation, monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of basic education \ninvestments and policies; and (iii) aid coordination strengthened. The project activities will be \nimplemented in close cooperation with MOPE and other relevant government agencies, to \nensure proper establishment of the Center and its effective functioning within the work and \nstructure of MOPE. The TA will have two stages: the preparation stage with the objective of \npreparing and establishing the Center; and the implementation stage with the objective of \ndeveloping the Center into a fully functional mechanism.  \n \n11.  The preparation stage will cover the first 6 months of the TA during which the Center will \nbe established. Main activities will focus on (i) conducting careful analysis of the institutional \nrequirements and constraints in the present organizational structure of MOPE; (ii) identifying \ndetailed  tasks  and  responsibilities  of  the  Center;  (iii)  identifying  appropriate  staffing \nrequirements, the terms of reference and relevant training requirements; and (iv) conducting \ninitial staff training. Training at this stage is to ensure that staff of the Center will gain a good \nunderstanding  of  the  overall  structure,  information  flows,  and  daily  activities  of  MOPE,  its \nvarious departments, and the PIUs, as well as the scope, content, and activities of the ongoing \ninvestment projects and those to come. In addition, existing PIUs will be re-organized along \nfunctional lines to increase communication and coordination.  \n \n12.  During the implementation stage, the Center will become operational in its main function \nof coordination. Based on needs, capacity-building activities for project implementation will be \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1997.

Study  visits  to  gain  first-hand \nknowledge and exchange experience abroad will also be organized. The Center\u2019s activities will \nbe closely monitored and evaluated. Capacity building and other adjustments will be made \nduring this stage to ensure that the Center fulfills its mandate.  \n \n13.  Capacity-building  activities  will  be  provided  to  both  staff  directly  involved  in  project \nimplementation and MOPE staff that will be affected by the integration process. The integrated \napproach to capacity building will ensure a common understanding of the role of the Center and \nshould ensure that different departments of MOPE and the PIUs will be able to work toward the \nsame objectives. Other funding agencies will be fully consulted in the design of the Centre and \nin  the  specified  training  requirements.  The  capacity-building  activities  will  produce  training \nmodules and materials in various media format for future use, and will enable the Center to act \nas a resource center for information on capacity building, materials, and activities in basic \neducation.  \n \n14.  The Center will designate a staff member as a focal point for aid coordination. By \ncoordinating aid-funded investment projects, the Center will play a key role in all externally \nsupported  activities  in  basic  education.  The  TA  will  design  and  develop,  with  full  funding \nagencies participation, a coordination mechanism. The mechanism should be effective and \nflexible, capable of facilitating coordination both on project activity and on strategy and planning \nlevels. The Center will establish and maintain a readily accessible database of funding agencies \nactivities. The Center will function as an advisory body to the minister of public education in \ncoordinating relationships with funding agencies and ensuring coordination, communication, and \ninformation flow with other government agencies involved in the basic education sector. The \nactive  participation  of  all  those  agencies  in  coordination  including  in  the  capacity-building \nopportunities offered to MOPE will, in turn, help strengthen the role and capacity of the Center. \n \n15.  A key activity of the TA during the second stage will be to evaluate the benefits of the \nCenter and analyze its long-term sustainability in preparation for its full integration into the \npermanent MOPE organization structure in the future. The evaluation will also help identify the \nneed for longer term training and capacity building for the Center and MOPE. A final workshop \nwill  be  held  for  sharing  experience,  lessons  learned,  and  benefits  achieved  during  TA \nimplementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be \nfinanced by ADB. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government\u2019s contribution, estimated at $100,000 equivalent, \nwill be in kind and cover remuneration of counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative \nsupport and logistics. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MOPE will be the Executing Agency. MOPE will work closely with a team of international \nand domestic consultants to implement the TA. MOPE will ensure that the consultants will have \neasy access to necessary  information and documentation for the creation of the Center, and \nthe analysis of training and capacity-building needs. MOPE will support the staffing exercise by \n ", "  5\nselecting\u2014following  the  identified  staffing  criteria\u2014lead  persons  within  MOPE  who  will  be \npaired up with the team of domestic consultants to ensure long-term sustainability of the Center. \nMOPE  will  also  support  the  TA  activities  by  creating  awareness  within  MOPE  and  the \nGovernment of the planned activities and objectives and the benefits that the Center will bring. \nMOPE will be responsible for organizing meetings with funding agencies and ensuring timely \nevaluation  of  the  benefits  of  the  Center  and  within  the  framework  of  agreed-upon  M&E \nmethodologies. MOPE will provide inputs including data and information to the consultants for \ndesigning and recommending policies and solutions to ensure the sustainability of the Center. \nRecommendations on future plans for the Center including a successful transition during the \nsecond phase will be adopted before the completion of the TA, to ensure continuity in the work \ncarried out by the Center and the quality of project implementation, M&E activities, policy \nrecommendations and aid coordination for the basic education sector.  \n \n18.  The  TA  will  require  the  services  of  a  team  of  consultants  (person-months  are  in \nparentheses), including an international consultant (total of 6), a domestic center coordinator \n(total of 24), and a number of domestic consultants (total of 76) (exact distribution of person-\nmonths among the function specialists will be determined by the team leader based on needs \nassessment, which will take place in the first month of project implementation). The international \nconsultant will be the team leader and will have experience in similar projects in the region as \nproject leader in setup, start-up, implementation, and monitoring of similar institutional functions \nwithin government agencies. The international consultant and the Center coordinator will be \nengaged as individual consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nby Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nthe selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of \nreference (TOR) of the international consultant and the coordinator. Once the specific needs \nand TOR for the domestic function specialists are identified and developed by the international \nconsultant and the Center coordinator with consultation and agreement of MOPE and ADB \nduring the first month of implementation, the recruitment will be through a domestic firm using \nquality cost-based selection (QCBS) and a simplified technical proposal. A generic TOR of the \nfunction specialists is in Appendix 4. Necessary office equipment (computers, furniture, etc.) for \nthe  Center  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB.  The \nequipment will be turned over to MOPE upon TA completion.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for Effective Management of Investments and Reforms in Basic \nEducation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved effectiveness  Effective Implementation of  Country education  \u2022  Government expands \nand efficiency in  public education reforms as  assessments, evaluation of  training opportunities at local \nplanning, managing,  planned   results achieved  level. \nand implementing      \u2022  Sustainability measures are \ninvestments in the  Improvement in analysis and  Planning documents, quality  in place. \neducation sector  planning capacity, measured  of government analysis and  \u2022  Continuity and evaluation \nby the quality and quantity of  inputs assessed by aid  are ensured. \npolicy and planning activities  agencies  Risk \nundertaken by the Ministry of    \u2022  Political pressures or \nPublic Education (MOPE)     instability exist               \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved institutional  Effective and timely  Project reports, results and  \u2022  Staff turnover is mitigated to \ncapacity of MOPE to  implementation of projects and  evaluation reports (data from  retain knowledge and \neffectively manage  programs (measured by  all aid agencies\u2018 activities)  expertise developed. \ninvestments in basic  assessment of reduced delays    \u2022  Coordination with other \neducation   in project implementation    agencies is efficient. \nactivities and quality of work)    \u2022  There is continuous learning \n    and training programs are in \nIncreased intraministry  Assessment based on  coordination with aid \ncoordination and increased  baseline survey and end of  agencies.  \neffectiveness in the ministry  project survey (including  \u2022  Aid agencies coordinate to \nwork flow, in relation to  government and aid  minimize duplication and \nimplementation effectiveness,  agencies assessment)  overlapping risks. \ncoordination with aid agencies     Risks \nand policy recommendations     \u2022  Staff lack incentives due to \n   \nmismanagement and unclear \nEffective coordination among  Analysis of duplications and  mandate.   \naid agency activities and  overlapping among aid \n\u2022  Aid agencies have scarce \nbetween MOPE and aid  agencies projects \ninterest in the government \nagencies   \napproach \n   \nSurvey and assessment to be  \u2022  Staffing is inefficient. \n \ndone at beginning of the  \u2022  Activities overlap and are \nproject and at project  duplicated. \ncompletion   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
