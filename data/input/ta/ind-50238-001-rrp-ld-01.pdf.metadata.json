India\u2019s economy grew at an average annual rate of 7.1%1 in 2009\u20132018, placing the \ncountry among the fastest-growing large economies and making it the third-largest economy in \npurchasing parity terms. The country nearly halved the poverty rate from 37.2% of the population \nin fiscal year (FY) 2005 to 21.9% in FY2012 (footnote 1). India\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), \nbased on constant market prices, increased by 4.2% in FY2020, a sharp deceleration from 6.8% \nin FY2019 (FY2018: 7.2%).2 Because of the slowdown, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced \nits benchmark policy repo rate by 135 basis points (bps) in February\u2013August 2019 to support \ngrowth. The onset of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns \nhave significantly impacted the economy and raised concerns of GDP contraction. These worries \nprompted RBI to reduce the repo rate sharply by another 115 bps in February\u2013August 2020 to \n4.0% to fuel economic growth. The consumer price index inflation rose sharply from 2.9% in March \n2019 to a peak of 7.6% in January 2020 and was 6.9% in July 2020.  \n \n2.  The Government of India responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by imposing one of the \nmost stringent lockdowns, starting 24 March 2020, before easing some of the restrictions in May \n2020  and  easing  them  further  in  June  2020.3  The  lockdowns  completely  halted  business \noperations and mobility in April\u2013May 2020, which not only impacted businesses but also resulted \nin  increasing  loss  of  livelihood,  primarily  in  the  lower-income  segment.  The  government \nannounced large-scale relief measures amounting to \u20b920 trillion, primarily targeting systemic \nliquidity and schemes focused on vulnerable economic segments.4 Liquidity measures were \ntransmitted through banks and various financial institutions by ensuring the availability of credit \nbacked by government guarantees.  \n \n3.  RBI announced policy measures to support the economy, including by reducing banks\u2019 \nstatutory ratio and the cash reserve ratio. Other measures included supporting nonbank finance \ncompanies (NBFCs) and the corporate sector by providing dedicated liquidity lines to banks, and \nby declaring a moratorium on all loans for March\u2013August 2020 at the discretion of the financial \ninstitutions, followed by one-time restructuring of loans until the end of December 2020 to help \nborrowers.5 COVID-19 infection levels continue to rise, with India being the third most affected \ncountry, raising significant concerns about the prospects of economic revival. GDP is expected to \ncontract by 9.0% in FY2021 before increasing to 8.0% in FY2022.6  \n \n1  World Bank. Development Indicators (accessed 15 July 2019). \n2  Government of India.

Financial Sector  \n \n4.  The financial sector is still developing, with banks playing the dominant role. As of the end \nof FY2019, the sector comprised 236 banks, including 161 scheduled commercial banks, 10 small \nfinance banks (SFBs), and 7 payment banks. Access to finance remains a key issue. About 190 \nmillion adults still do not have a bank account in India, second only to the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, despite account ownership more than doubling from 35% in 2011 to 80% in 2017.7 Access \nto credit is even more limited, with less than 6.6% of borrowers accessing credit through formal \nchannels.8 \n \n5.  Banking sector. The banking sector witnessed annual credit growth of 10.4% in FY2013\u2013\nFY2018, with a notable slowdown in FY2017 (8.7%) and FY2018 (9.4%) largely because of the \ndeteriorating asset quality of public sector banks (PSBs). The twin effects of demonetization \n(2016) and the roll-out of the goods and services tax (2017) also hampered growth. Credit growth \npicked up in FY2019 to 13.2% but slowed significantly to 5.9% in FY2020.9 Total deposits of all \nbanks stood at \u20b9137.3 trillion and total loans outstanding at \u20b9104.8 trillion as of the end of \nFY2020.10 \n  \n6.  The stress in the banking sector (especially PSBs) because of high exposure to certain \ntroubled  sectors  (e.g.,  power,  iron,  and  steel)  and  banks\u2019  aggressive  recognition  of  gross \nnonperforming assets (NPAs) led to gross NPAs peaking at 11.6% as of FY2018. Gross NPAs \nimproved to 9.3% at the end of FY2019 and further reduced to 8.5% as of FY2020. As of FY2020, \nprivate banks performed better, with reported gross NPA levels of 4.2% compared with 11.3% for \nPSBs. As of April 2020, 50.1% of all loans outstanding were under moratorium. Private banks had \n31.1% and PSBs had 67.9% of their portfolios under moratorium. Future asset quality of the \nbanking sector is largely dependent on the ability of customers under moratorium to weather the \ncrisis. As per the stress test conducted by RBI, in a severely stressed scenario, gross NPAs might \nescalate to 14.7% and the average tier-1 capital adequacy ratio might reach 9.4% from 11.7% as \nof FY2020. Profitability continued to remain subdued, driven by weak performance of PSBs. The \nreturn on assets (RoA) for the banking system improved over the previous year but was still \nlackluster at 0.2% in FY2020 (FY2019: \u20130.1%) and the return on equity (RoE) was 2.0% in \nFY2020 (FY2019: \u20131.5%). Private banks reported an RoA of 0.7% and RoE of 6.7% in FY2020. \nThe capital adequacy ratio of the banking sector improved to 14.8% in FY2020 from 14.3% in \nFY2019 after recapitalization of PSBs (footnote 9). \n \n7.  Nonbanking  financial  companies.  As  of  the  end  of  FY2020,  9,601  NBFCs  were \nregistered with RBI, with total loans outstanding estimated at \u20b925.0 trillion (FY2019 data), an \n18.6% rise from FY2018. Gross NPAs increased to 6.3% as of the end of FY2020 (from 6.1% at \nthe end of FY2019 and 5.8% in FY2018) because of continuous liquidity stress since September \n2018. As per RBI estimates, 49% of the NBFC portfolio was under moratorium as of April 2020. \nThe capital adequacy ratio for NBFCs declined to 19.6% as of the end of FY2020 from 20.0% in \nFY2019 and 22.8% in FY2018 because of declining profitability and increasing delinquencies. As \nper RBI\u2019s stress test, in the most severe scenario of gross NPA deterioration, capital adequacy is \nlikely to decline from 19.4% (as of 31 December 2019) to 15.2% (footnote 9). NBFC profitability \n \n7  World Bank. 2017. The Global Findex Database 2017, Measuring Financial Inclusion and the Fintech Revolution. \nWashington \n8  World Bank.

", "3 \n \nimproved during FY2019 (increased by 15.3%), albeit more slowly than in FY2018 (increased by \n27.5%). RoA remained stable at 1.7% as of the end of FY2019, the same level as reported as of \nthe end of FY2018.11  \n \n8.  The credit markets increased scrutiny of NBFCs (including housing finance companies \n[HFCs]) since FY2019, especially towards NBFCs\u2019 portfolio exposures, asset quality, and asset\u2013\nliability  mismatches.  The  liquidity  stress  trigger  was  the  default  in  September  2018  by  a \ndomestically AAA-rated NBFC, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Limited (IL&FS), \nwhich exposed the asset\u2013liability mismatch issues plaguing some companies in the sector and \ncaused a crisis of confidence among capital market investors such as mutual funds.12 Liquidity \nstress increased the funding costs and caused difficulties in market access in some cases, \nespecially from capital markets. NBFCs depend largely on bank and market borrowings, which \naccount for 70% of total liabilities of the sector. Bank borrowings, debentures, and commercial \npaper are NBFCs\u2019 major sources of funding. Bank borrowings as a share of total borrowings \nincreased from 21.2% as of FY2017 to 28.9% as of FY2020. Dependence on debentures declined \nfrom 50.2% as of FY2017 to 40.8% as of FY2020, indicating that banks were compensating for \nreduced capital market access for NBFCs (footnote 9 and 11).  \n \n9.  NBFCs and their customer segments have been heavily impacted by COVID-19. Most \nNBFC clients, who are largely in the informal segment, were (and, in certain locations, still are) \naffected by lockdowns. A slow recovery cycle because of extended or rolling lockdowns, coupled \nwith limited credit and weakening demand, worsened the credit profiles of these customers.  \nNBFCs\u2019 ability to extend moratoriums allowed by RBI was compromised because they did not get \na moratorium from all their lenders thus adversely impacted impacting the NBFC\u2019s liquidity \nposition.  13 The flow of fresh credit to the sector, especially to the lower-rated NBFCs, was \ncurtailed despite some targeted government interventions.14 Against annual credit growth of \n15.5% in FY2014\u2013FY2020, NBFCs are expected to experience their first fall in assets under \nmanagement (AUMs) in nearly 2 decades, with negative growth of 1%\u20133% in FY20201.15  \n \nC.  Microfinance Sector  \n \n10.  Overview. NBFC microfinance institutions (MFIs) undertake the crucial role of last-mile \nfinancing and are a key source of rural credit. Although banks still lead the MFI loan segment, \n \n11  RBI. 2019. Financial Stability Report, July 2019. New Delhi. \n12  IL&FS was an infrastructure holding company, structured as an NBFC, which had large institutional investors as \nshareholders, including some of India\u2019s largest state-owned enterprises. \n13 RBI allowed banks and NBFCs to extend a moratorium to their clients for 3 months, from March to June 2020. During \nthis cycle, NBFCs, which are largely funded by banks and mainly non-deposit taking, received on average a \nmoratorium from 50% of their lenders (capital market investors were not covered by RBI\u2019s circular), while extending \nthe moratorium to a larger subset of their customers (~90%\u201395% for microfinance, ~65%\u201370% for MSMEs, and \n~35%\u201340% for affordable HFCs), as estimated by NACL. RBI extended the moratorium until the end of August 2020.   \n14 RBI. 2020. Financial Stability Report. Mumbai. The declining share of market funding for NBFCs is a concern as it \nhas the potential to accentuate liquidity risk for NBFCs and the financial system. Smaller or medium-sized and AA-\nrated, lower-rated, or unrated NBFCs have generally not been supported by banks or markets. The situation \naccentuates the liquidity tensions faced by NBFCs and is reflected in the dampened response to the Targeted Long-\nTerm Repo Operations 2.0 program, which provided targeted liquidity support by RBI to banks to promote lending to \nNBFCs and MFIs, especially the lower-rated ones.

", "4 \n \nNBFC-MFIs contributed  32%  of  total  MFI  lending  volume  (SFBs,  which  used  to  be MFIs, \ncontributed an additional 17%16) as of FY2020, posting growth of 66% year-on-year.17  \n \n11.  Performance. As of FY2020, NBFC-MFIs provided microcredit to 32.2 million customers \nthrough 14,275 branches across the country, disbursing 27.8 million loans totaling \u20b9770.7 billion. \nDisbursements grew by 23% and the loan portfolio by 31% year-on-year as of FY2020. The total \nloan portfolio increased to \u20b9743.7 billion as of March 2020 (footnote 17). Problem loans among \nNBFC-MFIs increased by 2.46% as of FY2020 compared with 1.64% in the previous year for loan \naccounts 30 days past due. Most MFIs allowed a complete moratorium to all their customers for \nApril and May and slowly started collection as the lockdown ended. Collection efficiency ratios \nincreased to 70%\u201375% for most MFIs by July 2020. Certain places, however, are still under \npressure because of ongoing intermittent lockdowns and localized restrictions in response to high \ninfection  rates.  The  post-pandemic  risk  aversion  among  investors  has  constrained  market \nborrowings for MFIs, which have, however, raised \u20b920 billion in bonds on the back of the RBI \nliquidity facility.  \n \nD.  Micro, Small, and Medium-Sized Enterprise Finance Sector Overview \n \n12.  The International Finance Corporation (IFC)18 found that India had an estimated 55.8 \nmillion (nonagricultural) MSMEs operating in the top-five industries in FY2017: retail (46.0%), food \nproducts  and  beverages  (6.0%),  apparel  (5.0%),  motor  vehicle  repair  (4.0%),  and  textiles \n(3.0%).19 Predominantly unregistered, 94.9% of MSMEs were micro-, 4.9% small-, and 0.2% \nmedium-sized enterprises.20 MSMEs accounted for about 31% of GDP and 45% of exports, and \nemployed more than 124 million people. About 59.5% of MSMEs were in rural and 40.5% in urban \nareas (footnote 18).  \n \n13.  Despite the significant contribution of MSMEs to production and employment, evidence \nsuggests that their input to GDP is suppressed. The lack of adequate access to finance by MSMEs \nis the biggest challenge to growth and the reason why most micro and small enterprises do not \nbecome formal job-creating small- and medium-sized enterprises. Formal financial institutions \ncontributed only \u20b910.9 trillion of the total \u20b969.3 trillion of debt funding requirements of MSMEs \n(immediate addressable credit gap of \u20b925.8 trillion). About 84% of MSMEs self-finance or use \ninformal finance sources, while only 16% access credit from formal financial institutions. The \nCOVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected MSMEs. They have lost about $4.5 billion per day \nduring  the  lockdown.21  Corporate  revenues  declined  by  about  15%,  with  MSMEs  facing \nheadwinds as their revenues are expected to reduce by 17%\u201321% and earnings before interest, \ntaxes, depreciation, and amortization margins 30%\u201340% in FY2021.

SFBs have a higher priority sector requirement (75% of \nthe loan portfolio against 40% for a universal bank) and need to focus on smaller loans (50% of their loan portfolio \nshould comprise loans of less than \u20b92.5 million).  \n17  Synopsis of Micrometer 2020, MFIN, Issue 31, Gurugram, Haryana, India, March 2020.  \n18  International Finance Corporation. 2018.

NBFCs increased their exposure in this segment to 12.8% in September 2019 from 10.4% \nin September 2017 and private banks to 38.9% from 32.4%. NBFCs\u2019 contribution has come down \nmarginally post-FY2019, however, because of tighter liquidity. CRISIL expects NBFC financiers \nof MSMEs to decrease their AUMS by 3%\u20135% in FY2021.23 As of September 2019, private banks \nhad the best asset quality in the MSME financing space with gross NPAs at 4.5%, followed by \nNBFCs with 6.6%, and PSBs with 18.9%.  \n \nE.  Affordable Housing Finance Sector Overview \n \n15.  Limited housing supply adversely affects lower-income households, especially in large \ncities with low building standards. Because of constrained access to credit, mortgage penetration \nwas 10.3% as of FY2020, much lower than in other emerging markets such as the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (18%), Thailand (20%), and Malaysia (34%).24 India has a housing shortage of \nabout 18.7 million25 in urban and 43.7 million26 in rural areas. More than 90% of the housing deficit \nis estimated to be in the affordable housing segment, primarily for the economically weaker \nsegment  (EWS)  and  low-income  groups  (LIGs).27  Consequently,  the  Government  of  India \nprioritizes housing and launched the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) Initiative in 2015, \naiming to build 20 million affordable homes for the urban poor, including those in the EWS and \nLIGs by 2022.  \n \n16.  While most commercial banks are active in mortgage lending, they have played a much \nsmaller role in housing finance than HFCs. A total of 101 HFCs are registered with the National \nHousing  Bank.  The  HFC  market  remains  highly  concentrated,  with  the  15  largest  lenders \naccounting for 90% of HFC assets.28 HFCs primarily targeted special customer segments (often \noutside urban areas), including affordable housing and the self-employed,29 and offered better \ncustomer service to compete with urban banks and to be able to pass on the increased cost of \nfunds to the end borrowers. As of March 2020, HFCs accounted for 34% of the total mortgage \nloans market (footnote 24). HFC AUMs are expected to grow 0%\u20132% in FY2020 because of the \npandemic (footnote 23).  \n \n22 CRISIL. 2020. MSMEs Face Existential Crisis, Revenues to Fall a Fifth.
