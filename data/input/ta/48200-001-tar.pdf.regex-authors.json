INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Azerbaijan requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to support the development of a policy, legal, and regulatory framework to enable private \nsector  investment  in  its  power  sector.  The  Update  of  the  Power  Sector  Master  Plan  of \nAzerbaijan,  2013\u20132025  finalized  in  February  2014  forecasts  a  total  sector  investment \nrequirement in excess of AZN8.5 billion until 2025 to meet the growing demand and address the \nreliability  and  inefficiency  of  aging  power  system  infrastructure.1 Enabling  private  sector \nparticipation in Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector will assist the government in meeting the significant \ninvestment requirements for the sector, improve overall sector efficiency, and provide a basis to \nassess potential future power sector reforms. \n \n2.  A consultation mission was fielded in January 2014, during which the government and \nADB mission agreed on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference. The technical assistance (TA) concept paper \nwas approved on 10 April 2014.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Aging infrastructure. Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector infrastructure is characterized by aging \nequipment largely managed and operated by state-owned power companies Azerenerji and \nBaku Electric Grid.4 The government, through these two companies, has completed significant \ninvestments  in the  sector  since  2004.  However,  a  large  portion  of  the  assets  still  require \nrefurbishment  or  replacement  to  achieve  sustainable  levels  of  operational  and  commercial \nperformance.  In  addition,  the  demand  for  electricity  in  Azerbaijan  is  expected  to  grow  on \naverage by over 4% per annum for the next decade.5 \n \n4.  The recently completed update to the master plan outlines over AZN8.5 billion of priority \ninvestments from 2013 to 2025 to meet the projected demand of Azerbaijan, including: \n(i)  Generation. AZN2.75 billion in capital expenditures for new generation capacity \nto meet growing demand and replace large, aging, and inefficient oil-fired plants. \n(ii)  Transmission system. AZN1.20 billion to reinforce and extend the system. \n(iii)  Distribution  system.  AZN4.57  billion  to  (a)  upgrade  the  old  and  under-\nmaintained low voltage distribution system that causes low reliability and high \nlosses of around 18%\u201320%, and (b) extend the system to meet the growing \ndemand. \n \n5.  The  government  recognizes  the  urgent  need  to  invest  and  renovate  the  power \ninfrastructure in order to efficiently deliver electricity to all customers and meet the country\u2019s \nsocioeconomic  development  targets.  Further  developments  beyond  the  priority  investments \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Update of the Power Sector Master Plan of Azerbaijan, 2013\u20132025. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila. \n2  The TA is included in ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: Azerbaijan, 2014\u20132016. Manila. The title has \nbeen updated from \u201cDeveloping Legal Framework for Private Sector Participation in the Power Sector\u201d included in \nthe country operations business plan to more accurately reflect the broader required TA scope of preparing an \nenabling environment for private sector investment. The ADB funding requirement has increased from $500,000 to \n$800,000 to incorporate the broader scope. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 April 2014. \n4  Baku Electric Grid owns and operates the distribution system in the capital, Baku, and retails electricity to its \ncustomers. Azerenerji is a vertically integrated power company supplying the remainder of the country and \nwholesale electricity to Baku Electric Grid. \n5  Footnote 1. \n \n ", "2 \noutlined above, such as the development of renewable energy, capacity to increase the reserve \nmargin, or capacity for export markets, would require additional funding. \n \n6.  Bridging  the  financing  gap.  Historically,  the  state-owned  utilities  have  received \ngovernment budget support and accessed funding through international finance institutions and \ncommercial banks. However, due to their highly leveraged position, with a debt-to-earnings \nbefore interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio of 5.0x\u20136.0x, the utilities\u2019 access to \nnongovernment-supported  funds  is  limited. 6 The  government\u2019s  budget  cannot  support  the \nAZN8.5 billion of priority investments outlined in the update to the master plan. The limited state \nbudget will inevitably defer the pace of power sector development and will hamper economic \ngrowth. To meet the investment requirements, the government will need to mobilize alternative \nfinancing  resources,  including  potentially  increasing  electricity  tariffs  and  optimizing  tariff \nstructure,  introducing  connection  charges  for  customers,  and  encouraging  private  sector \nparticipation. \n \n7.  Existing  sector  structure. The  Azerbaijan  power  sector  is  currently dominated  by \nAzerenerji,  the  publicly  owned,  vertically  integrated  monopoly.  The  Tariff  Council  sets  the \nwholesale and retail power prices, as well as the fuel price charged to the generators. The laws \ngoverning the sector include provisions outlining the intentions of the state with respect to \nrestructuring.  To  date,  the  sector  has  undergone  minimal  restructuring,  with  no  formal \nrestructuring time frame envisaged. \n \n8.  The current legislation neither requires transmission and distribution to be separated \nfrom generation nor envisages the presence of a separate transmission system operator and \ndistribution system operator. Accounting, functional and/or managerial disaggregation has not \nbeen accomplished or envisaged by legislation. As such, the sector retains inhibitors to private \nsector participation, including limited third party access regulation, weak sector governance, \ninefficient  operations,  subsidy-driven  and  nontransparent  tariff-setting  principles,  chronically \nweak financial performance of sector entities, and off-taker creditworthiness. A private sector \nparticipation road map is needed to address the limitations of the existing sector structure. \n \n9.  Previous private sector participation. Participation of the private sector in Azerbaijan\u2019s \npower sector is limited to a few small hydropower plants.7 The government has previously \npiloted private sector participation in both the distribution and generation subsectors. Various \nattempts to involve the private sector in large generation projects have not been successful \npartly  due  to  the  lack  of  a  supporting  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework. When  the \ndistribution companies were privatized under ineffective management contracts in 2002, the \nexpected performance improvements in power supply were not achieved. On the contrary, when \nthe responsibilities of the distribution sector were returned to state-owned companies in 2006, \nthe grid was found to be in very poor condition. Excessively high losses had to be accepted and \npower outages were frequent. As a result, there is some reticence at the governmental and \ninstitutional levels to reengage with the private sector. Clear and structured benefits of private \nsector participation will need to be demonstrated to encourage broad stakeholder acceptance. \n \n                                                \n6  Standard & Poor\u2019s Financial Services. 2013.

Sheki (1.6 \nmegawatts) and Mughan (3.8 megawatts) have been privatized so far. The rest of the plants are still to be \nprivatized. \n ", "3 \n10.  Capacity. Due to limited experience with private sector participation in the infrastructure \nand utility sectors, Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector would benefit from (i) obtaining the best possible \ninternational technical and management capacity to develop an enabling business environment \nfor private sector participation, and (ii) identifying and structuring a demonstration project for \nprivate sector participation. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be the promotion of private sector participation in Azerbaijan\u2019s power \nsector. The outcome will be an improved business environment for private sector participation in \nthe power sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  is  structured  as  a  sequential  program  of  tasks.  Phase  1  includes  the \nidentification of the benefits of private participation in Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector and any current \nrestrictions, followed by the recommendation of a road map for private sector participation. In \nparallel,  a  detailed  review  of  the  existing  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  framework  will  be \nundertaken and recommendations provided to enable private sector participation.8 \n \n13.  Once the government commences the implementation of phase 1 recommendations, \none or more demonstration project will be identified and structured by the consultant under \nphase 2 of the TA. The demonstration project will be selected through multi-criteria analysis. \nThe high-level project structure and development plan will be developed based on the type of \ndemonstration project selected.9 Phase 2 will be completed in parallel with the implementation \nof phase 1 to provide (i) ongoing momentum to the phase 1 recommendations, and (ii) a \nconcrete example of private sector participation in Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector, which can be \nreferenced  during  the  potentially  challenging  implementation  stage  of  phase  1.  Phase  2 \ndepends on the successful completion of phase 1 and the government\u2019s ongoing support for \nprivate sector participation in the power sector. \n \n14.  The TA will reference international best practice for private sector participation in the \npower sector and assess the potential application and benefits specific to Azerbaijan\u2019s power \nsector. The outputs to be completed under the TA include: \n(i)  a road map for private sector participation in Azerbaijan\u2019s power sector; \n(ii)  a report recommending policy, legal, and regulatory changes required to create \nenabling environment; and \n(iii)  a  project structure  and  development  plan for  a  demonstration  private  sector \nparticipation project(s). \n \n15.  It is assumed that  (i) government and donor commitment to energy sector reforms \ncontinues, (ii) the private sector continues to have the interest and resources to participate in \nthe power sector, and (iii) the process to procure or attract private sector participation (to be \n                                                \n8  The proposed sector structure is outlined in State Program for the Development of the Fuel and Energy Sector \n(2005\u20132015), the Law on Electricity (Baku, 13 June 1998, No. 723), and the Memorandum of Understanding on a \nStrategic Partnership between the European Union and the Republic of Azerbaijan in the field of energy, signed on \n7 November 2006, as updated. \n9  Project structure includes project value proposition; scope; boundaries and output identification; financing options \n(e.g., build\u2013own\u2013operate\u2013transfer); and outline contractual structure required to implement the project. \n ", "4 \ncompleted  post-TA)  is  completed  successfully.  Risks  associated  with  this  TA  include  the \npotential  inability  of  the  private  sector  to  procure  the  equipment  required  to  complete  the \nproject(s) under acceptable commercial terms and the possibility that political influences prevent \nbroad government support for the recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \n \n17.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart \nstaff, meeting facilities, access to country data, and other in-kind contributions. A working group, \nincluding representatives from ministerial and institutional stakeholders, will also be established. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing and implementing agency for the TA. The \nMinistry of Finance will coordinate with the working group, which will meet on a bimonthly basis. \n \n19.  The TA project will be conducted by a firm of consultants (or consortium) to be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time) using quality- and cost-based selection (with a 90:10 technical:financial ratio) and \nsimplified technical proposal. The firm will provide four international consultants (9.25 person-\nmonths) and three national consultants (9 person-months). The consultants will consist of a \nprivate sector participation specialist, power engineer, two legal experts, finance expert, power \nsector regulation expert, and communications and stakeholder management expert. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from November 2014 to April 2016. The \noutcome  and  outputs  will  be  disseminated  through  bimonthly  working  group  meetings.  In \naddition, the three reports on outputs will be published on the government and ADB websites. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Azerbaijan  for  Preparing  an  Enabling  Environment  for  Private  Sector \nParticipation in the Power Sector, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "                        Appendix 1        5  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nPrivate sector  Private sector participation  Project participation  The government\u2019s and \nparticipation in the  in a major component (i.e.,  details published on the  donor\u2019s commitment to \npower sector promoted.  generation, transmission, or  Ministry of Energy\u2019s  energy sector reforms \ndistribution) of the power  website, supported by  continues \nsector by 2020, increased  participating companies\u2019 \nPrivate sector continues \nfrom the 2014 participation  annual reports \nto have the interest and \nin small embedded \nresources to participate in \ngeneration (less than 10 \nthe power sector \nmegawatts) only \nProcess to procure or \n   \nattract private sector \n    participation (to be \ncompleted post-technical \nassistance) is \nsuccessfully completed \n \nRisks \nInability of private sector \nto procure required \nequipment to complete \nproject(s) under \nacceptable commercial \nterms \n \nPolitical influence \nprevents timely legislation \nOutcome      Assumption \nThe business  The government accepted  Consultant reports  The government\u2019s \nenvironment for private  demonstration project  published on ADB  ownership and \nsector participation in  structure by May 2016  website  sustainability of sector \nthe power sector is    reforms remain high \nimproved.
