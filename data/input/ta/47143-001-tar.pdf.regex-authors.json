INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Climate  change  is  now  recognized  as  a  significant  public  health  threat.  Rising \ntemperatures  and  changing  rainfall  patterns  are  spreading the  occurrence  of  vector  borne \ndiseases such as malaria and dengue. 1 Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic \n(Lao PDR) bear an unusually high burden of vector-borne diseases; in recent years more than \n150,000  dengue  cases  were  reported  annually. 2  Health  system  functions  need  to  be \nstrengthened  in  order  to  increase  resilience  and  adapt  to  a  changing  climate.  Support  to \nnational health systems include investments in surveillance systems, human resources and \nhealth infrastructure to help build capacity for a coordinated response at the national and \nregional level. The proposed regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) aims to \nstrengthen the national health systems of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam to prepare, \ncoordinate, and respond to climate-induced health threats.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 reconfirmed \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  for  regional  public  goods,  including  the  control  of \ncommunicable diseases, as one of ADB\u2019s institutional objectives.3 The proposed TA will help \noperationalize recommendations of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 with regard to \nstrengthening regional public goods for health through scaling-up efforts on communicable \ndisease control and related climate-induced health risks.4 The TA on Strengthening Resilience \nto Climate Change in the Health Sector in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) for Cambodia, \nthe Lao PDR, and Viet Nam was included in the GMS regional cooperation operations business \nplan, 2013\u20132014.5 The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Nordic Development Fund \n(NDF).6 It will build on ADB\u2019s comparative advantage in facilitating regional cooperation and \nstrengthening regional public goods for health, such as the Second Greater Mekong Subregion \nCommunicable Disease Control Project (CDC2)  and proposed regional interventions on malaria \nelimination  and  control,  and  complement  ongoing  NDF-supported  TA  to  build  capacity  for \ncoping with climate change.7  The participating developing member countries\u2014Cambodia, the \nLao PDR, and Viet Nam\u2014were involved in TA preparation and welcome the initiative.8 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \n                                                \n1  These include deaths related to communicable and noncommunicable diseases, contributing to the burden of \ndisease patterns and possibly prolonging the fight against vector-borne and waterborne diseases.

Changes  in  temperature  and  rainfall  patterns  are  increasing  the  vulnerability  of \npopulations to the incidence of vector-borne diseases. A higher risk of heat waves in urban \nareas reduces air quality and exacerbates the occurrence of respiratory infections. The pace of \nurbanization and population mobility is in turn compounding these diseases.9 Strengthening the \nresilience of national health systems is a priority for Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam to \nachieve sustainable economic development. In the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), health \nhas been identified as a priority sector within national adaptation plans. Support to national \nhealth systems includes enhancing existing surveillance systems, human resource development \nand identifying future health infrastructure investments to help build capacity to improve tracking \nof disease and coordinate response at the national and regional level.  \n \n4.  The  WHO  Regional  Committee  for  the  Western  Pacific  developed  the  Regional \nFramework for Action to Protect Human Health from the Effects of Climate Change in the Asia\u2013\nPacific Region.10 The governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam recognized that \nclimate change is a major threat to development and approved climate change strategic plans \nfor public health as part of the national strategic plans on climate change.11 The TA builds on \nand complements other climate change TA projects in the region such as ADB\u2019s projects on \nCapacity Enhancement for Coping with Climate Change in the Lao PDR, on Mainstreaming \nClimate Resilience into Development Planning in Cambodia, and on Support for the National \nTarget Program on Climate Change with a Focus on Energy and Transport in Viet Nam.12 \n \n5.   An essential prerequisite for health adaptation to climate change is to increase the \nknowledge  base  and  the  human  skills  needed  to  analyze,  prioritize,  plan,  and  implement \nadaptations. Given that consideration of climate change adaptation for health is a new area, \nadvocacy and knowledge sharing will also be critical to developing a successful program. \nIdentification of investments for adaptation and capacity building will be required to address \nrisks to the health sector from extreme climate events. Improved surveillance will be crucial in \nproviding  timely,  disaggregated  surveillance  of  climate-sensitive  infectious  diseases. 13 \nDownscaling climate models will be utilized to project how climate change may affect health in \nthe region.14 Investments are also needed in a range of human resource development areas to \nincorporate (i) new knowledge and skills related to climate change into current health systems \n                                                \n9   Vector reproduction, the parasite development cycle, and bite frequency rise with temperature. Therefore, malaria, \ndengue, and tick-borne encephalitis are increasingly widespread. In Japan, dengue reoccurred after almost 40 \nyears. \n10  WHO. 2013.

Manila. \n13  The ADB-financed CDC2 has developed a database platform on communicable disease incidences, which could \nbe used to include climate change-related diseases and function as an early warning system. \n14  Downscaled regional climate models provide climate change adaptation planning at the local and regional levels. \nDeveloping  countries  have  started  to  simulate  local  climate  change  impacts  using  statistical  downscaling. \nStatistical  downscaling uses  a series  of  equations  to convert  global scale  mode  output  to  regional scale \nconditions. \n ", "  3 \npractices, and (ii) adaptations in health and other infrastructure to ensure responsiveness to \nextreme  weather  and  related  disasters.  Limited  economic  studies  are  available  to  enable \ndecision  makers to  understand  (i)  how  to  most  effectively  address  the  rising  burden from \nclimate-sensitive diseases, and (ii) the costs and benefits of health adaptation in relation to \naverting the health risks of climate change. \n  \n6.  Capacities need to be built within national and regional academic and research institutes, \npublic health and healthcare institutions, and environmental agencies to assess how climate \nchange may alter the effectiveness of programs. Public and private health institutions need to \nimprove their capacities with regard to climate change epidemiology, stronger early warning \nsystems,  better  risk  assessments,  and  more  innovative  communication  approaches.  For \nsuccessful  adaptation,  the  use  of  integrated  and  cross-sector  approaches,  and  the \nestablishment of networks and solutions on a regional basis from a number of fields (including \nagriculture and water management) will be necessary. Gender-sensitive collection, analysis, \nand reporting of sex-disaggregated data are needed to better understand the health implications \nof  climate  change  and  climate  policies.  This  will  provide  information  to  support  gender \nmainstreaming in climate change policies, as well as to empowerment individuals to build their \nown resilience.15 \n \n7.  Both governments and the private sector have an important role in facilitating adaptation \nthrough (i) investing in regional public goods, including improved monitoring and prediction of \nclimate  change  and  better  monitoring  of  regional  impacts;  and  (ii)  building  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) for climate-related investments in health and related sectors. The TA aims \nto help explore private sector engagement in adaptation measures since successful private \nsector  involvement  in  adaptation  could  catalyze  greater  investments,  which,  in  turn,  could \naccelerate the replication of climate-resilient technologies and services.16 The TA will help to \nidentify activities in the areas of regional surveillance and human resource development as part \nof  the  proposed  GMS  Health  Security  Project.   Given  that  most  activities  are  focused  on \ncapacity building at the institutional level, TA interventions are likely to be sustained. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be reduced vulnerability to climate-induced health risks, especially for \nvulnerable populations, including the poor, migrants, and ethnic minority groups in the GMS. \nThe outcome will be enhanced capacity of participating countries and health agencies in climate \nchange adaptation. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Knowledge  and  understanding  of  the  relationship  between  climate \nchange and human health improved. The TA will work with regional academic and research \ninstitutions, and public health and environment authorities to build science-based knowledge to \naddress  the  health  impact  of climate  change and quantify the  additional  burden  of  health \noutcomes. Reliable national and regional surveillance data will be necessary to identify (i) trends \nin epidemiological patterns and various pathways by which climate change affects public health; \n                                                \n15  WHO. 2011.

The activities will help the ministries of health to (i) improve \nthe database on disease incidence (early warning); (ii) reinforce surveillance to strengthen \nclinical services and assessment of regional risks and opportunities; (iii) identify adaptation \noptions, including the most suitable and cost-effective health interventions; and (iv) assess \ncapacity to deliver interventions.18  \n \n10.  Output 2: Human resource skills in coping with climate change adaptation in the \nhealth sector strengthened. The TA will support workforce development by helping to ensure \nthe training of a new generation of competent, experienced public health staff to respond to the \nthreats posed by climate change and incorporate mainstream climate concerns into health \npolicies and programs. Activities include (i) development of technical guidelines for adaptation in \nthe health sector based on existing modules, (ii) training on field epidemiology and disease \nsurveillance related to climate change adaptation, and (iii) enhanced emergency preparedness \nfor rapid response and recovery from extreme weather events. At the local level, community \ngroups, including women\u2019s groups, will need to be involved to strengthen local public health \ninterventions, which will increase community resilience and emergency preparedness. The TA \nwill complement ongoing work in the area of surveillance and emergency preparedness by \ninstitutions including the WHO, Institut Pasteur, and the Mekong River Commission. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Knowledge  products  shared  and  advocacy  promoted. This output is \ndesigned to increase awareness about the significance of climate change in the public and \nprivate  sectors  and  to  identify  potential  PPPs  for  adaptation  measures,  e.g.,  climate-proof \ninfrastructure. The TA will support high-level advocacy for decision makers, including officials \nfrom the ministries for planning and investment, finance, natural resources, and the environment, \nas  well  as  local  and  regional  academic  and  research  institutes,  to  discuss  benefits, \neffectiveness,  and  costs  of  adaptation  options;  cost-effective  interventions;  and  necessary \ninvestments. The TA will foster cooperation among developed and developing countries on \nclimate change to provide and/or share information.19 The national technical working groups on \nclimate change, as well as climate change networks and the GMS secretariats in each country, \nwill also serve as platforms for knowledge sharing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $4,410,000, of which \u20ac4,000,000 will be financed by NDF on \na grant basis. The grant amount will be converted to US dollars upon receipt and administered \nby ADB.20 The governments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, office accommodation and utilities, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n \n                                                \n17  Poor women, children, and elderly people are more likely to be affected by climate-induced health risks. \n18   The CDC2 commenced with the development of a database on disease incidence in Viet Nam. \n19  A number of platforms for knowledge sharing exist such as ADB\u2019s regional consultation meetings and the website \nof the CDC2. \n20  The amount of \u20ac4,000,000 is equivalent to $4,360,000 based on an exchange rate of $1.09 on 25 March 2015. \nThe amount of \u20ac4,000,000 is subject to currency fluctuations based on the date of conversion. \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the executing agency through its Southeast Asia Department. In Viet Nam, \nthe  implementing  agency  will  be  the  Health  Environment  Management  Agency,  which  is \nresponsible for the coordination of climate change activities in the MOH and will coordinate \nclosely  with ADB\u2019s CDC2  (footnote 7). In Cambodia, the implementing agency will be the \nDepartment of Preventive Medicine, which coordinates climate change-related interventions and \nis also the implementing agency for the CDC2. In the Lao PDR, the implementing agency will be \nthe Department of Hygiene and Health Promotion, which will work closely with the CDC2.21 \nBuilding on the CDC2 (footnote 7) and the proposed GMS Health Security Project, the TA will \nfoster regional knowledge sharing and dialogue on the impact of climate change on health and \nthe harmonization of databases and surveillance systems. Cooperation with the WHO country \noffices in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam is sought to strengthen vector surveillance \nand vulnerability mapping. The MOH in Myanmar and selected representatives of the climate \nchange alliance will participate in regional consultation meetings.22  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented from 1 August 2015 to 31 December 2018. The TA will \nprocure the services of (i) international consultants (up to 58 person-months) and national \nconsultants (up to 243 person-months), and (ii) short-term international and national resource \npersons (up to 150 working days) to provide specific expertise. The international TA coordinator \nand team leader will support the consultants based in the respective departments in the health \nministries  of  the  three  countries.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  including \nexperts in public health, science, climate change adaptation, training, and health economics, are \nin Appendix 3. All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All consultants (except those engaged as \nresource persons) will be recruited through a firm using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Short-listed firms will be required to submit full \ntechnical proposals. Output-based contracts will be utilized to the extent possible. Procurement \nof goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time \nto time). Advance action for consultant selection and recruitment is proposed to avoid initial \nstart-up  delay.  An  advanced  payment  facility  will  be  opened  with  the  three  implementing \nagencies to administer funds for national workshops and procurement of small-scale equipment. \nDisbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n15.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac4,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nNordic Development Fund for Strengthening Resilience to Climate Change in the Health Sector \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n                                                \n21  Assessment of financial management systems, procurement, and financial reporting of implementing partners are \nnot required for this high-value TA as the ministries of health in the three countries are already implementing a \nnumber of ADB-financed projects and are not delegating implementation to a third party. \n22  The climate change alliance committee provides technical and administrative support for policy development and \nreform agenda. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nReduced vulnerability to  By 2020    Stable economic \nclimate-induced health      environment \nrisks, especially for  Temperature-related  National MOH surveillance   \nvulnerable populations,  morbidity and mortality from  data  Risk \nincluding the poor,  key climate change-induced    Major natural disasters \nmigrants, and ethnic  diseases (e.g., dengue and  World Health Organization \nminority groups in the  waterborne diseases) averted  burden of disease study \nGMS  (Baseline: not applicable) \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced capacity of  By 2019    Government remains \nparticipating countries      committed to integrating \nand health agencies in  Participating countries  ADB TA quarterly progress   health into climate change \nclimate change  identified cost-effective  reports  planning, and provides \nadaptation  priority interventions to    personnel and resources \nreduce burden of diseases     \nrelated to climate change    Risks \n     High staff turnover \nAdopted national health  Country-specific health   \nadaptation plans in three  adaptation plans  Insufficient budget \ncountries     allocation \n  TA prefeasibility studies \nImproved use of early \nwarning systems (disease \nincidence) and surveillance \nby the health sector in three \ncountries \nOutputs  Revised national health    Assumption \n1.
