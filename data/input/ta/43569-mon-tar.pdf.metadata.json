INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Transformational Mobile Banking Services policy and advisory technical assistance \n(TA) project will make possible the creation of an informed and effective regulatory environment \nthat fosters the expansion of, and competition and innovation in, mobile phone-based banking \nservices (\u201cm-banking\u201d) for the underbanked in Mongolia. A fact-finding mission visited Mongolia \non  14\u201317  February  2009  and  the  Government  confirmed  the  TA\u2019s  objectives,  scope,  and \nimplementation arrangements.1 The project's design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    \u201cBranchless banking\u201d is an umbrella term for the process by which a customer may \nperform banking transactions electronically without visiting an actual bank. Electronic banking \n(\u201ce-banking\u201d) involves the remote delivery of new and traditional banking products and services \nthrough electronic delivery channels such as the internet. M-banking is a subset of e-banking, \nand  involves  the  use  of  a  mobile  phone  or  other  mobile  devices  to  undertake  financial \ntransactions linked to a client\u2019s account, which may or may not exist in a bank. M-banking \nservices  are  simple,  typically  requiring  only  that  the  client  understands  how  to  send  text \nmessages to transmit or receive account information or make payments. These services are \nsome of the most rapidly growing initiatives in developing countries, enabled by (i) the rapid \ngrowth of mobile phone coverage and ownership; and (ii) the fact that cheaper mobile devices, \nwhich enable remote transactions, may have more effective outreach than physical branches.2 \n \n3.  A substantial body of evidence demonstrates that improving access to financial services \nhelps poor people and decreases poverty, and that technological improvements are a key part \nof this process. Beck et al showed that the highest barriers to financial services for the poor are \nphysical access to bank services. 3 The Financial Sector Development, Economic Growth, and \nPoverty Reduction: A Literature Review of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) notes that \nfinancial sector development alleviates poverty by increasing access, and that development \nassistance  has  been  helpful  in  improving  regulatory  environments  and  can  have  catalytic \neffects.4 m- Banking: A Knowledge Map cites both theoretical and practical evidence that m-\nbanking  will  expand  access  to  financial  services  for  large  numbers  of  poor  and  isolated \nhouseholds.5 The study notes further that donors have done little to explore the transformational \npotential  of  mobile  banking,  and  recommends  that  donors  support  improvements  in  the \ninformational, policy and regulatory environment for m-banking.  \n \n4.  The Enabling Environment for Mobile Banking in Africa defines two regulatory models for \nm-banking:6  (i)  the  additive  model,  in  which  a  mobile  phone  is  an  additional  method\u2014\ncomplementing computers\u2014to access banking or other financial services, and is suitable for \nmiddle-income households; and (ii) a transformational model, in which the mobile phone is used \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 15 May 2009. The TA objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements were reconfirmed with the Bank of Mongolia on 11 December 2009.  \n2  Bankable Frontiers. 2008.

The \ntransformational model has vast potential but has only taken hold in about six countries, all of \nwhich have relatively open regulatory regimes. In the last 3 years, millions of m-banking clients \nhave accessed formal financial services, many for the first time, in Brazil, Jordan, Kenya, \nMaldives, the Philippines, and South Africa. In the Philippines, which is the key model for \ntransformational m-banking, both large mobile telephone operators have partnered with banks \nto provide clients with domestic and international remittances, payments services, and even \nrural salary payments without the need for a bank account or a physical branch.  \n \n5.  The transformational model is more suited for countries and regions wishing to expand \ntheir financial services geographically and to deepen financial markets. There are three criteria: \n(i) widespread access to mobile phones, (ii) a wider pool of informed and literate potential \ncustomers, and (iii) the existence of an actual or potential system of payments that allows for \ncash withdrawals (and the potential to expand to agent arrangements). All of these conditions \nexist  in  Mongolia.  Currently,  there  are  four  cell  phone  providers  and  34  internet  service \nproviders in the market. Costs have decreased for users and coverage has increased. As of \n2008, cell phone users number 1.7 million and subscribed Internet users total 110,000.7 The \nprimary persons who need improved access to financial services are herders, civil servants, \nsmall business people, and pensioners. The population of 2.8 million is highly literate (over \n95 %) and the median age is 25. However, a total of 36.1% of Mongolians live below the poverty \nline of $0.75 per day (with half living under $2.00 per day). The rural population of approximately \n1.6 million is scattered, isolated and highly mobile. Half of the people who live in the rural areas \nare semi-nomadic herders who may only visit an area with physical banking services twice a \nyear, although they are very likely to have cell phone access and to make regular stops in small \nvillage areas for provisions and social reasons.  Regular trade even in the smallest areas and a \ngood payments system allows the third condition to be met.  \n \n6.  Banks constitute an estimated 95% of the formal financial system in Mongolia, with three \nbanks dominating 70% of the market. The banks which have demonstrated the most interest in \nreaching rural areas are Xaan Bank, Mongol Post Bank, and Xac Bank. Margins are quite high \n(up to 20% per annum) consistent with the costs of maintaining networks outside the capital and \nother market weaknesses. Bank savings services have grown rapidly in rural areas, as have \nselected forms of collateral-based credit and minor unsecured microcredit. While a significant \ndevelopment has been the increase in accessible microfinance, the numbers are still quite small. \nIn 2001, less than 1% of the population had access to lending from mainstream financial \ninstitutions, and this number grew to 15% by 2005.  \n \n7.  Recent  sector  review  work  suggests  that  the  government  should  encourage  the \ndevelopment of new products and services which can support the development of micro-, small-, \nand medium-sized enterprises, particularly in rural areas. Mongolia's uniquely low population \ndensity  makes  traditional  branch  systems  prohibitively  expensive,  so  m-banking  is  a  very \nrealistic alternative to increase access to finance. And with costs of brick-and-mortar branches \nrising, it is critical to introduce methods for lowering the costs of providing financial services in \nrural areas\u2014which m-banking can accomplish. \n \n                                                \n7  D.

A recent rapid review of mobile banking regulation in Mongolia found that while the \nenvironment was not explicitly resistive, lack of clarity has prevented transformational mobile \nbanking from developing.8 Banks are regulated by the Bank of Mongolia (BOM), the country\u2019s \ncentral bank. Nonbank entities that plan to offer financial services have to obtain a license from \nthe  Financial  Regulatory  Commission.  The  Communication  Regulatory  Commission  is  the \nactual regulator in this space, while the Information, Communication Technology, and Post \nAgency is ostensibly the policy maker. These two organizations develop laws and regulations \nfor e-commerce, e-security, and e-signatures. Lack of clarity creates confusion regarding the \nroles of BOM and the Financial Regulatory Commission as well as those for the Communication \nRegulatory Commission and the Information, Communication Technology, and Post Agency in \nmobile banking.  \n  \n9.  Within the current regulatory framework, laws do not restrict banks or licensed nonbank \nfinancial  institutions  from  providing  a  range  of  mobile  financial  services.  Currently,  the  m-\nbanking  services  that  are  available  for  individual  users  in  Mongolia  include  account \nmanagement, bill payment, loan monitoring, and credit card management.9 However, these \nservices are available only to a small number of wealthy urban clients. M-banking services are \nnot offered to poorer households. Regulators have not yet considered the potential of this \ntechnology to deepen financial services to poorer households or as a mechanism to improve \ntrade. At the same time, there is no legal structure describing oversight of agencies, e-security, \nconsumer  protection,  and  a  number  of  other  relevant  issues.  There  are  no  definitions  of \npayment, e-money, e-money services, card-based instruments or other important distinctions. \nAlthough there is some awareness of mobile banking where the mobile services are tied to a \nbank account, there is little understanding of stored value services that create virtual accounts \non either cards, mobile phones, or other devices. This latter concept is not only absent from the \nlaws, it is not part of the thinking of many potential players in the market.  \n \n10.  While the private sector is interested in m-banking, it is unlikely that transformational m-\nbanking will be introduced and targeted to the poor without appropriate market information, \nregulation, and potential subsidy for the first pilots. Such arrangements will define the difference \nbetween additive and transformational m-banking development. In Mongolia, the BOM has the \nresponsibility  of  establishing  rules  for  m-banking.  Xac  Bank  has  proposed  the  piloting  of \ntransformational m-banking services, and a small grant for startup has been provided by the \nConsultative Group to Assist the Poor. However, regulations have not yet been established and \nconsistently promulgated across regulators, preventing Xac Bank from starting their pilot.  \n \n11.  ADB became involved in mobile banking relatively recently, and the work undertaken \nhas been comprised primarily of assessments of the enabling environment in the Pacific and \nPakistan.10 Situational studies were completed in Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, and Tonga in \n2008 under regional TA projects, with additional work being contemplated. In September 2008, \na study on improving access to financial services in Pakistan through the use of technology was \nconducted, which suggested the provision of subsidies to expand branchless banking services \nto unbanked areas, based on a review of conditions and the existing Branchless Banking \nRegulation.11  \n                                                \n8  J.

In addition, none of the work has provided specific attention to cross-\nborder remittances, which are a major feature in m-banking internationally.  \n \n12.  The Mongolia Country Program Strategy 2006-2008 includes as the financial sector \noutcome \"sound financial system with improved efficiency and outreach and improved access to \nfinancial services.\"13 The 2008-2010 Mongolia Country Operational Business Plan14 states that \nadvisory TA is expected to address institutional strengthening and efficiency of public service \ndelivery, and that efforts will be made to supplement the non-lending program with co-financing. \nThe  proposed  R-PATA  will  enable  the  implementation  of  a  regulatory  system  for  mobile \ntelephone-based financial services which will facilitate both competition and transformational \nmarket behavior to expand financial services to poorer households, particularly in rural areas. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of this TA will be improved access to formal financial services among the \npoor and unbanked in Mongolia through the introduction of transformational mobile banking \nservices. Its outcome will be a regulatory environment for m-banking that promotes competitive, \ntransformational  market  behaviors.  Measurable  results  expected  by  the  end  of  the  TA\u2019s \nimplementation  include  m-banking  interoperability  and  consistent  regulatory  agreements \nbetween key regulators in Mongolia, m-banking financial regulations that meet emergent good \npractice, and at least one pilot transformational m-banking startup by end 2012.  \n \n14.  The TA will build on recent experience and market conditions to enable an informed \nregulatory environment that fosters the expansion of, and competition and innovation in, m-\nbanking.  Implementation  will  include  an  m-banking  oversight  committee  made  up  of  key \nregulators in finance and telecommunications; a diagnostic structure for the market to review \nand identify key gaps and hindrances to the operation and expansion of transformational m-\nbanking services; a statement of intent, guidelines on essential policy, and facilitated regulatory \nreform for m-banking to ensure the implementation of appropriate rules.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  First, the consultants will review existing m-banking studies to determine methodologies, \nand extract insights that can be used for the TA\u2019s purposes. They will identify methods for \nidentifying and engaging all potential regulatory bodies and other key players, and recommend \na methodology for the review of the regulatory environment and structures relevant to m-\nbanking.  Aspects  of  m-banking  which  may  influence  its  transformational  nature  and/or  its \ninfluence  across  borders  will  be  identified  and  incorporated  into  the  methodology.  The \ndiagnostic tool for branchless banking developed by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor \nwill also be considered.15 The methodology will then be finalized. \n \n                                                \n12  J.

Next, a joint m-banking oversight committee with private sector representation will be \nestablished. The committee will include members who represent regulators for banks, other \ntypes of financial institutions, telephony, competition, and consumer protection as appropriate. A \ndiagnostic review of current regulatory framework will then be undertaken, focusing on the \nenabling  principles,  the  gaps  and  hindrances  to  the  development  of  m-banking,  and  the \nconsequences of regulatory weaknesses. An international study tour to the Philippines will be \nprovided to assist regulators to see a successful and appropriate regulatory framework. Based \non the results of this analysis, a statement of intent and a policy road map for the reform of \nregulations  will  be  drafted  and  endorsed  The  reforms  in  Mongolia's  road  map  will  be \nimplemented  under  the  m-banking  oversight  committee  and  the  first  pilot  approved  for \nimplementation. At three key points, workshops will disseminate findings to stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.   The TA is estimated to cost $450,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2014Others). Contributions by \nthe Government of Mongolia, estimated at $50,000 equivalent on an in-kind basis, will cover \nremuneration of counterpart staff, office space and meeting venues, furniture, administrative \nsupport, and logistics. The TA will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem of consultants, as \nwell  as  training,  workshops,  publications,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  The  detailed  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented for 18 months, from 31 January 2010 to 31 July 2011. The \nBOM will be the executing agency, with guidance from the m-banking oversight committee. ADB \nwill consult broadly for the development of the standard methodology for m-banking use.  \n \n19.  One  international  consultant  (for  a  total  of  7  person-months)  and  two  national \nconsultants (for 20 person-months), with expertise in the areas of mobile banking regulation, \ntelephone regulation, and regulatory facilitation, will be individually recruited and engaged by \nADB, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). The consultants' terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Individual consultant recruitment \nis justified by (i) the need for expediency; and (ii) simplicity of the recruitment requirements.  \n \n20.  Equipment for use by the m-banking committee and TA consultants (two computers and \nsoftware, a high-speed internet connection, a printer and a photocopier) will be procured by \nADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), \nand will be handed over at the end of the TA to the BOM. Seminars, overseas tours, and \nconferences will be included in the contract of, and will be organized and administered by, the \ninternational consultant. TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook.16 \n    \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of Mongolia for Transformational Mobile Banking Services, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board.  \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2008.
