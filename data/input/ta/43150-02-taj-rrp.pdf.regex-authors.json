I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ngrant to the Republic of Tajikistan for the Regional Power Transmission Project. The design \nand monitoring framework for the project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  The project is critical for energy security in Tajikistan. It targets the expansion and \nmodernization of the electricity transmission network and paves the way for much needed \nreforms. Transmission network modernization is a precondition to cutting system losses, \nimproving energy efficiency, and facilitating energy trade with neighboring countries. The \nlatter is a national priority, but also a key goal under the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation Program (CAREC). Reform focuses mainly on the national utility company, \nBarki Tojik.  This is a precondition for raising key performance indicators, governance, and \ninstitutional effectiveness. A problem tree analysis provides context for the project. This \nmirrors the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). Key sector issues are given in \nthe summary sector assessment.1 \n \n3.  Generation gap. About 98% of all electricity generated in the country comes from \nhydropower plants (HPPs). While this is environmentally attractive and cost-effective, the mix \nalso results in significant winter shortages. It does produce high summer surpluses, but these \nare wasted unless they are traded with neighboring countries. Current installed capacity is \nabout  5,055  megawatts  (MW).  This  comes  from  eight  large  plants,  several  smaller \nhydropower facilities (4,737 MW), and two fossil-fuel-fired combined heat and power plants \n(318 MW). This capacity is more than enough to meet domestic demand during most months \nof the year, but not in the winter. Many remote areas have power only a few hours a day. \nThis affects rural and urban populations and businesses. \n \n4.  Energy security. The winter shortage (about 500 MW) has both short- and medium-\nterm solutions. The latter includes non-hydro facilities and/or building selected run-of-the \nriver schemes. While not rejecting any of these options, the government is more keen to \ndevelop larger, and by definition, longer-term projects, in particular, the completion of a large \ndam first started under the Soviet period (Rogun).2 The latter is a major undertaking. It \nrequires considerable technical and financial resources, strong project management and first \nclass  environmental  due  diligence  to  ensure  full  consensus  with,  and  among,  riparian \ncountries  over  the  water  flows  and  other  potential  impacts.  In  the  meantime,  the  most \neffective way to deliver energy security is to step up work on energy efficiency and to expand \nand modernize the transmission network. Regional trade is the most effective way to address \nwinter shortages and summer surpluses. This worked well in the past and can be easily \nrevived in the future. This is a key feature of the CAREC energy strategy. Trade requires \nstrong collaboration among the regional countries, but also a quality transmission network. \nRepairing this network is a top priority for the government, along with sector reforms and the \nrestructuring  of  Barki  Tojik.  Energy  efficiency  is  linked  to  transmission,  although  the \n                                                 \n1  Summary Sector Assessment: Energy (Appendix 2). \n2  Work on the first phase of the project is under way, although a share purchase scheme to finance these works \nhas been frozen. ", "2 \ndistribution system and the energy practices by industrial, residential, public administration \nand commercial users also play a role. The distribution system needs improvements, but not \nas urgently as the transmission network.   \n \n5.  Transmission. The transmission network is in a bad state of repair (leading to high \ntechnical losses). It also has limited geographic coverage. This affects the evacuation of \npower from plants and restricts winter and summer trade with Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic.  Low network coverage exacerbates Tajikistan\u2019s high dependence on \nthe  Central  Asian  Power  System  which  operates  out  of  Tashkent.  At  the  same  time, \nimprovements in reliability of Tajikistan\u2019s network ultimately improve the overall reliability of \nthe Central Asian Power System. The latter breaks down from time to time and often create \ndisputes among member countries. \n \n6.  Operational performance. Since 2006 the government increased electricity tariff by \nmore than 200%; however, the financial position of the sector is still weak. Technical and \ncommercial losses are high, while the collection rate remains low. Arrears of the state-owned \nenterprises are increasing with organizations under the Ministry of Land Reclamation and \nWater Resources being on the top of the list. Recognizing the need for series of policy \nreforms  to  address  the  deteriorating  infrastructure,  inadequate  capacity,  and  weakened \ninstitutions, the government developed a strategy for power sector reform and investment \nand requests international assistance. 3 \n \n7.  Project. Although the energy sector needs investments across the entire chain, the \ngovernment and ADB have agreed to tackle the transmission network first. This requires \nphysical  investments  and  reforms.  The  project  is  included  in  the  Tajikistan  country \npartnership strategy (CPS) 2010-2014 and country operations business plan 2010-2012. \nThe project is part of CAREC. This is the second regional transmission project in Tajikistan. \nWork on a transmission line to Afghanistan is underway.4    \n   \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  project  will  improve  the  reliability  of  the  transmission  system  and  supply  to \nhouseholds and businesses. This will increase energy security, energy efficiency, and energy \ntrade. It will also improve reform, governance, and the operational effectiveness of Barki \nTojik. The outcome will be an expanded and modernized high-voltage transmission network.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The main components of the project are as follows: \n(i)   Construct a 220-kilovolt (kV) transmission line between Kairakum and Asht \n(approximately 70 km), and rehabilitate the Kairakum 220 kV substation and \none additional bay in the Asht 220 kV substation. These facilities will aid \nexports to the Kyrgyz Republic and increase energy security in the northern \npart of the country, including Asht.   \n                                                 \n3  Summary Sector Assessment: Energy (Appendix 2). \n4  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "3 \n(ii)  Construct  a  220  kV  transmission  line  between  Geran  and  Rumi \n(approximately  69  km),  rehabilitate  the  220  kV  Rumi  substation,  and \nrehabilitate and expand the 220 kV substation at Geran. The transmission line \nwill support electricity exports to Afghanistan5 and improve energy security in \nsouthern Tajikistan.  \n(iii)  Rehabilitate the Regar 500 kV and Baipaza 220 kV substations. Regar is the \nmajor 500 kV substation connecting Tajikistan to the Central Asian Power \nSystem.  Technical  problems  at  the  Regar  substation  impact  on  the  entire \nCentral Asian Power System, and interrupt electricity supplies to about 50% of \nTajikistan's consumers.  \n(iv)  Install  a supervisory  control  and data  acquisition  (SCADA)  system  at  the \nnational control center and key high-voltage substations. This will replace an \noutdated and partially-collapsed Soviet telecommunication system and central \ncontrol panel with a real-time information system, essential for any substantial \nelectricity grid, and critical for decision making.  \n(v)  Implement  reforms  and  provide  capacity  development  and  operational \nperformance improvements at Barki Tojik and the power sector. ADB intends \nto support the government on a reform action plan focusing on governance, \noperational and financial performance, including cost recovery. It will take a \nphased approach where phase 1 focuses on comprehensive assessment of \nthe sector and Barki Tojik to define problems, deficiencies and opportunities. \nPhase 2 will define sector reforms and action plans including the restructuring \nof Barki Tajik, and phase 3 will focus on the implementation of the reforms.  It \nalso  includes  the  preparation  of  a  sector  development  master  plan  for \nrehabilitation and expansion of generation, transmission and distribution for \nthe next 20 years. Additionally, it provides capacity building (planning and \noversight), project management support, and training.6  \n \n1.  Physical \n \n10.  The project will build two new 220 kV single-circuit transmission lines totaling 140 km \nof overhead line (OHL). It will also rehabilitate in whole or part six transmission substations at \nKairakkum, Asht, Geran, Rumi, Baipaza, and Regar. A third output is to put in place a \nSCADA  system  linked  to  a  National  Dispatch  Centre  in  Dushanbe,  and  32  priority \nsubstations across the country (capable of expansion to 204 national substations). The \nconstruction of these facilities will be done through three design, supply and install contracts, \nincluding testing and commissioning. \n \n  2.  Nonphysical \n \n11.  The project will implement a sector operational performance improvement program \ntargeting  Barki  Tojik  and  comprising  the  following  activities:  (i)  development  of  program \nstrategic and business plans and corporate governance changes; (ii) commercial, operating \nand financial plans; (iii) project management and training; (iv) preparation of accounting and \nmanagement  information  systems;  and  (v)  preparation  of  technical  or  operational \nperformance audits. The program also includes reviews of sector-wide policy and institutional \n                                                 \n5  On 29 August 2008, Tajikistan signed a power purchase agreement with Afghanistan for 25 years. \n6  Summary Sector Assessment: Energy, and Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \nissues followed by sector reform program with specific action plans and their implementation. \nThe reform program will be supported by ADB through the proposed project implementation. \nLeast-cost sector infrastructure development master plan is an additional output.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n12.  The project is estimated to cost $141 million (Tables 1 and 2).  \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n ($ million) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.

The  government  has  requested  a  grant  not  exceeding  $122  million  from  ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources to help finance the project. The amount of $9.5 million will be \nallocated to the Ministry of Energy and Industry for sector reforms and capacity development \nfor  Barki  Tojik.  The  remainder  will  be  re-lent  to  Barki  Tojik  through  a  subsidiary  loan \nagreement to fund the physical investments. The relending is for a term of 25 years, with a 5-\nyear grace period, and interest rate of 5% per annum. Barki Tojik will be responsible for \nforeign exchange risks, an established practice between the Ministry of Finance and Barki \nTojik. The government and Barki Tojik will contribute $19 million. For the government\u2019s \ncontribution, it will either (i) allocate additional funds from the budget to cover value-added \ntax (VAT) and customs duties accrued on project expenditures, or (ii) exempt the project \n ", "5 \nfrom such taxes and duties. Detailed cost estimates are given in the project administration \nmanual.7   \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Barki Tojik will be the executing agency for the physical investments. The Ministry of \nEnergy  and  Industry  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  sector  operational  performance \nimprovement  program.  Project  implementation  management  will  be  outsourced  to  a \nspecialized firm. The firm will report to Barki Tojik and handle all project-related activities, \nsuch as the preparation of tender documentation and oversight over the evaluation and the \ncontract awarding process. It will also supervise the contractors and report to the government \nand ADB on project execution performance. One of the requirements for the firm is to build \nthe facilities on time, within budget and to pre-set standards. Contracts will have fixed price \nand fixed delivery periods, with premiums and penalties against performance and quality \nindicators. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3, and described in \ndetail in the project administration manual.7 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \n \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  September 2010\u2500July 2014 \n   \nEstimated project completion date  February 2015 \n   \nProject management   \n(i)   Executing agency (physical)  Barki Tojik  \n(ii)  Executing agency (nonphysical)  Ministry of Energy and Industry \n(iii)  Project management  Outsourced to a consultant team \nAmount  \nProcurement  Method  Contracts \n($ million) \n(i)   Plant-design, supply and install contract  ICB  1  40.0 \nfor substations \n(ii)  Plant-design, supply and install contract  ICB  1  35.0 \nfor transmission lines \n(i)   Plant-design, supply and install contract  ICB  1  18.5 \nfor SCADA \nAmount  \nConsulting services  Method  Contracts \n($ million) \n(i)   Project management (firm)   QCBS  1  5.0 \n(ii)  Sector operational performance  QCBS  1  9.5 \nimprovement program (firms) \nDisbursement  Type  Minimum  Ceiling \n(i)  Plant-design, supply and install contract  Direct payment  $100,000  No \n(ii) Consulting services  Direct Payment/  $100,000  No \ncommitment/ \nreimbursement \n                                                 \n7  Project Administration Manual (Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n15.  ADB conducted technical due diligence on the investment proposal and is satisfied \nwith the quality of the cost estimates, operating cost structures, appropriateness of the \ntechnology, and the execution plan. The \u201creadiness\u201d level is high and the technical solutions \nare assessed to be more cost-effective than the alternatives. The SCADA system is a \nstandard power utility practice based on proven technology, and considered appropriate in \nthis case. Barki Tojik\u2019s operational and maintenance staff are familiar with the proposed \ndesign  concepts.  The  technical  proposals  do  not  represent  a  major  shift  from  existing \npractices. Training will be included in the contractor's scope of work.  The SCADA system is \na technological step change for the company. This will require training to be included in the \nterms  of  reference  of  project  management  consultants  and  contractors.  This  is  routine \npractice for a utility when first implementing a SCADA system. All investment sites were \nvisited  by  consultants  and  ADB  staff,  and  the  poor  condition  of  existing  facilities  was \nconfirmed. The contracts will include sufficient spare parts and quality and performance \nguarantees.  \n \nB.  Barki Tojik Operations \n16.  The due diligence work included a full review of Barki Tojik operations.  Back in 2006 \nthe company was split from the Ministry of Energy and Industry, the intention being to deliver \nmore efficiency and governance. After 4 years, performance on these targets has been \ndisappointing. There are also gaps in the policy regime (shortcomings on planning, oversight, \ntariff structures, maintenance and conditions for private sector involvement). The company \nitself still lacks a clear strategic focus and sound management. Its business plan is disjointed \nand unfunded. Physical assets (generation, transmission and distribution facilities) are in a \nbad state of repair. Maintenance at best is ad hoc. The internal organizational structure is \nineffective and corporate governance inept. Management, financial and operational staff \nskills are inadequate. Decision-making is slow; even slower is the collection of receivables. \nTogether with ineffective cash management practices, these gaps aggravate an already dire \nfinancial  situation.  A  credible  financial  audit  needs  to  be  conducted  across  the  board. \nTechnical losses are high and increasing. Financial management is poor. The management \ninformation and reporting systems are unreliable. Service quality is low, and so is staff \nmorale.  A  restructuring  and  management  improvement  plan  is  required.  The \ncommercialization of operations is a must to ensure the viability of any investment. The \nproposed investment in transmission facilities will be synchronized with reforms that are \nincluded in the project. Others will form part of a program loan planned with ADB.  \n \n17.  In particular, the government is willing to adopt legal and regulatory reforms and \naccepts  the  concept  of  immediate  but  well-thought  out  restructuring.  It  is  also  keen  in \nopening  up  opportunities  for  the  private  sector,  particularly  in  power  generation.  The \nrestructuring  of  Barki  Tojik  needs  additional  and  detailed  due  diligence  and,  thereafter, \nspecific  and  sequenced  actions  in  three  areas:  (i)  commercialization  of  operations,  (ii) \ncompetition, and (iii) divestment. The commercialization aspect is critical to unlock other \nchanges and ensure financial viability. The opening up of the market to independent power \ngeneration companies requires access to an efficient transmission network. A regulatory \nbody will ensure equal treatment to all. The sale of selected generation and distribution \nassets  is  only  possible  once  a  policy,  legal,  and  regulatory  regime  is  in  place.  An \n ", "7 \nintergovernmental  committee  made  up  of  various  state  stakeholders  will  oversee  the \ndefinition and implementation of the reform and restructuring plans. It has asked ADB to be a \nmember of this committee (observer status), and oversee the reform works. The plan needs \nassessments where financial audit is a first priority. The other work will identify other gaps.  \n \nC.  Economic and Financial \n \n18.  The financial analysis has been performed. All financial costs and benefits of the \nproject are expressed in constant 2009 prices. Cost streams used to determine the financial \ninternal rate of return, i.e., capital investment, operation and maintenance, insurance costs \nand taxes, reflect the costs of delivering the benefits. The financial internal rate of return is \n6.24%. This is higher than the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 3.54%. The \nfinancial viability was estimated by comparing the incremental costs and benefits with- and \nwithout-project  scenarios.  The  incremental  benefits  arise  from  reduced  outages  and \ndomestic and international power sales. Regional benefits are not included in the financial \nevaluation, although these are substantial.  \n \n19.  The economic viability takes into account a stream of benefits and costs resulting \nfrom  the  construction,  installation,  and  operation  of  the  facilities.  Although  the  regional \neconomic benefits are presented and highlighted, they are not included in the computation of \nthe economic internal rate of return as these accrue to countries other than Tajikistan. Other \nnon-quantifiable benefits are in local areas such as Asht, Gafurov, and Kanibadam, and \ninclude increased yields in agriculture (power supplies making a difference), increased hours \nof operation by processing industries (leading to more jobs and income), and the opening of \nschools and health centers. The transmission facilities will benefit people and businesses. \nThe economic internal rate of return is 31.4%, higher than the 12% opportunity cost of \ncapital.8 \n \nD.  Governance \n \n20.  The government will comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) for the purposes of the project. ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through \nits agents, any allegedly corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nproject and the government will cooperate fully with any such investigation and extend all \nnecessary assistance. To support these efforts, all contracts financed by ADB will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of \nBarki Tojik and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they \nrelate  to  the  project.  Grant  funds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time).   \n \n21.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines. The work includes a risk management assessment. The financial management \ncapabilities  of  Barki  Tojik\u2019s  mirror  those  of  the  country.  There  are  substantial  gaps  in \naccounting standards, disclosure and auditing. Barki Tojik itself is in poor financial condition, \na situation aggravated by unacceptably low receivables collection rate. It has high electricity \nlosses  from  both  technical  and  commercial  sources,  inadequate  controls  and  reporting \nsystems, weak financial management arrangements, and a serious shortage of trained staff \nto run this part of business. Corporate planning is inadequate. Poor customer care and \n                                                 \n8  Financial and Economic Analyses (Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \ncustomer relations are another feature of the business model. Barki Tojik is poorly managed \nand seriously underfunded. The governance structure is weak. \n \nE.  Poverty and Social  \n \n22.  The transmission lines will cross public and mostly unused lands and affect cultivated \nplots only in a few locations. The substations will have no social impacts at all. Employment \nopportunities are expected during the construction. Gender-responsive core labor standards \nto promote female employment opportunities with non-discrimination, equal pay for work of \nequal value, and provision of separate male and female toilets where appropriate will be \nensured. The construction site will have an influx of workers which can increase the risk of \nHIV/AIDS.  A  gender-sensitive  HIV/AIDS  awareness  campaign  will  be  conducted  for \nconstruction  workers  and  communities  adjacent  to  the  construction  site.  This  will  be \nmonitored by ADB and the project supervision advisors.  \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n1.  Environmental Assessment  \n \n23.  An environmental assessment was completed.9 Environmental categorization of the \nproject is B. The transmission lines run through areas with low environmental sensitivities \nand do not traverse any village or settlement. Distances to any dwelling or settlement will be \nkept at a minimum of 50 meters. No significant or irreversible impacts are expected with the \noperation of the new lines. There will be some temporary impacts during the construction \nphase  but  appropriate  mitigation  measures  have  been  developed.  Provided  the \nenvironmental management and monitoring program is properly implemented, these impacts \nwill not be significant. Barki Tojik\u2019s environmental management expertise is low; provisions \nfor training are included in the environmental management budget. \n \n  2.  Social Assessment \n \n24.  Two subprojects\u2500Geran-Rumi and the Kairakhum-Asht transmission lines\u2500will cause \nimpacts only on two-thirds and one-third of the alignment, respectively, and affect only small \nplots occupied by tower bases. These two subprojects will also cause small losses of crops \nand  trees  due  to  stringing  operations  and  the  construction  of  the  towers.  Overall,  the \nsubproject impacts will have minimal effects on the livelihood of affected people. No impact \non buildings will occur and no family will have to be resettled. In order to assess and set the \nmechanisms for the compensation of these impacts, a land acquisition and resettlement plan \nwas prepared in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009).10 Involuntary \nresettlement category is B. Under Tajikistan law, few farmers own their lands. This means \nthat  no  land  will  be  technically  acquired  and  no  land  compensation  will  be  provided. \nHowever, to rehabilitate the affected people for land-use losses, they will receive income \nfrom the land occupied by the towers in addition to actual crop compensation. The two \ntransmission lines will affect Tajik and Uzbek communities. These are considered to be \nparticularly vulnerable, and are generally well adapted to the Tajikistan political-economic \nprocess. These groups do not show elements that would identify them as indigenous peoples \n                                                 \n9  Initial Environmental Examination (Appendix 2). \n10  Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plans for the Gerein-Rumi 220 kV Transmission Line, and Kairakhum-Asht \n220 kV Transmission Line (Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nas defined by the relevant ADB policy. Such a policy, therefore, will not be triggered by this \nproject and indigenous people categorization of the project is C.  \n \nG.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n25.  The project does not have any unusual technical risks. The components will use \nstandard technologies, and these conform to international standards. They are commercially \nproven and widely used across the world. During the implementation, various tasks will be \noutsourced to independent experts. This will ensure that the equipment and works comply \nwith design requirements and agreed quality standards. The risk of improper operation and \nmaintenance of facilities will be mitigated through training programs at the level of Barki \nTojik.  The  broader  policy  framework  will  also  be  tightened  to  pay  more  attention  to \nmaintenance.  \n \n26.  Another risk is the weak organizational structure of Barki Tojik.
