Two loans are from the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  Ordinary  Capital  Resources  (OCR): \n(i) a  program  loan  of  $50,000,000  to  support  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms in the rural finance sector; and (ii) a project \nloan of $10,000,000 for rural enterprise development. The third \nloan (also a project loan) of Special Drawing Rights7,005,000 \nfrom  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds  resources  is  for  institutional \nstrengthening of rural finance institutions (RFIs).  \n   \nClassification  Poverty Intervention \nThematic: Good governance, gender and development  \n   \nEnvironment  Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken \nClassification   and the summary is a supplementary appendix.  \n   \nRationale  Notwithstanding average economic growth of nearly 5% over the \npast  two  decades,  almost  40%  of  the  population  is  poor  or \nvulnerable  to  poverty.  Poverty  is  overwhelmingly  a  rural \nphenomenon, as roughly 88% of the poor live in rural areas. \nEmployment, either on-farm or nonfarm, is mainly in subsistence \nactivities  typical  of  poor  and  low-income households. Poverty \nreduction,  therefore,  is  the  central  objective  of  the  economic \nreform program of the Government of Sri Lanka.  \n \nA vibrant rural economy requires a robust rural finance sector that \ncan  efficiently  mobilize  and  allocate  resources  and  facilitate \nexchange  of  goods  and  services.  However,  the  rural  finance \nsector in Sri Lanka is highly fragmented and the RFIs suffer from \nweak governance, poor repayment rates, high transaction costs, \nweak supervision, and recurring losses. Instead of mainstreaming \ngood governance and sustainability as core values, successive \ngovernments have adopted ad hoc and short-term measures that \nexacerbated the weaknesses. As a result, the demand and supply \ngap for rural credit amounts to Sri Lanka rupees (SLRs) 10 billion \n($103 million), of which half relates to rural poor households. \n \nThe  contribution  of  rural  finance  to  rural  growth  through \ninvestments in agriculture and rural enterprises remains unfulfilled. \nProduction  and  marketing  bottlenecks,  due  to  weak  rural \ninfrastructure and low skill levels, reduce the profitability of the \nrural  sector,  which  remains  trapped  in  low-risk  and  low-return \ninvestments. This will widen income gaps within rural areas and \nbetween rural and urban areas, and will have long-term negative \neffects on consumption and asset buildup, especially for rural poor \nhouseholds. ", "iv \nThe Program Loan    \nObjectives   RFSDP is designed to contribute to economic growth and poverty \nreduction. The goal is to enhance outreach of sustainable rural \nfinance services. The objective is to establish a sustainable rural \nfinance  system  through  policy  adjustments  and  improve  the \noperations of RFIs. Institutionalizing policies that emphasize good \ngovernance will yield considerable benefits in terms of fostering a \nlong-term  sector-wide  perspective  for  sustainability.  Efficient \ndelivery of rural finance services will reduce transaction costs and \nhelp ensure viability of RFIs as well as that of rural enterprises, \nthus contributing to employment generation, income expansion, \nand poverty reduction.  \n \nComponents and  Major  issues  in  the  rural  finance  sector  that  require  policy \nOutputs   interventions  are  covered  by  the  program  loan.  Support  for \ninstitutional strengthening and outreach are covered by the project \nloans. The program loan includes five components: (i) conducive \npolicies,  (ii) supportive  legal  and  regulatory  framework, \n(iii) institutional  reforms  for  sustainability,  (iv) strengthening the \ndemand  side,  and  (v) expansion  of  rural  finance  in  conflict-\naffected areas. The reforms introduce fundamental changes in \nRFIs,  namely  cooperative  rural  banks  (CRBs),  regional \ndevelopment  banks  (RDBs),  the  National  Development  Trust \nFund (NDTF), and Samurdhi Banking Societies (SBS). The legal \nand regulatory framework introduces effective supervision of RFIs \nand  creates  legal  provision  for  enhancing  the  participation  of \nmicrofinance-nongovernment organizations (MF-NGOs) and other \nprivate sector initiatives in rural finance. In addition, the reforms \nwill redefine the Rural Economy Resuscitation Fund (RERF) for \nextending skills, technical, and marketing support to enable the \nrural poor to efficiently utilize rural finance services.  \n \nFinancing Plan   ADB will provide a loan of $50,000,000 from its OCR, with a 15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffer rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75%  per  annum,  and  a  front-end  fee  of  0.5%  of  the  loan \namount, and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the \nProgram Loan Agreement.  \n \nProgram Period and  The program loan will be released over a 4-year period in four \nTranching  tranches to meet the expected occurrence of associated costs. \nThe  first  tranche  of  $15,000,000  will  be  released  on  loan \neffectiveness,  the  second  tranche  of  $20,000,000 within  12 \nmonths of the first tranche, the third tranche of $10,000,000 within \n18  months  of  the  second  tranche,  and  the  fourth  tranche  of \n$5,000,000 within  18  months  of  the  third  tranche,  subject  to \ncompliance with release conditions.  \n \nExecuting Agency and  The  Ministry  of  Policy  Development  and  Implementation \nImplementation  (MPDI) will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  The  Ministry  of  Rural \nArrangements   Economy will be the implementing agency (IA) for RERF, RDBs, ", "  v\n \nArrangements   Economy will be the implementing agency (IA) for RERF, RDBs, \nand the Rural Finance Sector Development Agency; the Ministry \nof Co-operatives for CRBs; the Ministry of Samurdhi for SBS; and \nNDTF for NDTF restructuring.  \n \nProcurement   Loan proceeds will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange \n  cost of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding ineligible items.  \n \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds generated from the program loan will be used \nto meet the costs associated with the reform agenda.  \n   \nThe Project Loans    \nObjective   There are two project loans. The OCR project loan supports rural \nenterprise development through a credit  line. The project loan \nfrom ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will support building sector \ncapacity, developing financial infrastructure, RFI restructuring, and \nproject implementation.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   ADB will provide a loan of $10,000,000 from its OCR, with a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-\nend fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \nADB will provide a loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights7,005,000 from its Special Funds resources, with a \n32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; and with an \ninterest rate charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter; and such other terms and conditions \nas set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \nExecuting Agency  MPDI will oversee and coordinate project implementation. The \nand  Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) will be the IA for building sector \nImplementation  capacity. Other IAs, indicated for the program loan, will deal with \nArrangements  aspects relating to their respective institutions.  \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Expenditure procedures will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook. \nConsultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will \nbe recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. A total of 58 person-months of \ninternational  and  628  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \ninputs will be required for implementation. Where firms are to be \nengaged,  the  quality  and  cost-based selection method will be \nutilized  for  the  selection  of  consultants.  Where  possible  and \nappropriate, simplified technical procedures will be applied.  \n ", "vi \nBenefits and  RFSDP represents  a  shift  to  a  financial  system  development \nBeneficiaries   approach where sustainable RFIs will meet income expansion, \nemployment generation, and poverty reduction objectives through \nenhanced outreach and product diversity resulting in more clients \nserved  and  their  diverse  needs  met  over  time.  Diminishing \ndependence of RFIs on subsidies will decrease politicization.  \n \nLegal and regulatory framework and institutional reforms have \nbeen anchored on good governance, transparency, and rigorous \nfinancial discipline. Cost-effective supervision ensures the safety \nof the savings of millions of rural households. While RFSDP will \ndirectly support about 10,000 small and micro rural enterprises \nand 850 community subprojects, the real benefit will accrue with \nthe  outreach  expansion  of  RFIs  using  their  own  resources, \nestimated at 200,000 new clients during RFSDP duration.  \n \nSocial and   Rural poverty would be reduced more rapidly by sustainable RFIs \nEnvironmental Issues  than  welfare-oriented  arrangements  with  no  prospects  for \nsustainability.  The  strengthening  of  RFIs  will  ensure  that the \npoverty reduction impact is felt beyond the life of RFSDP. RFIs \nhave sound prospects to expand their services and meet the \ngrowing demand and supply gaps. Appropriately designed and \npriced  services  that  take  into  consideration  the  asset  and \nconsumption  buildup  of  households  are  expected  to  enhance \nhousehold income above the poverty threshold after four or five \nmicro loan cycles. For dealing with core poverty issues in conflict-\naffected  areas,  RFSDP  provides  a  flexible  approach  for \nreactivating, strengthening, and establishing new RFIs.  \n \nRisks and Safeguards  The  major  risk  relates  to  lack  of  sustained  Government \ncommitment  to  a  market-driven  rural  finance  sector.  The \nGovernment\u2019s  commitment  to  ongoing  financial  sector  reforms \nmitigates  this  risk.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder \ncoordination, and capacity building are safeguards against the risk \nfor delay in reforms. Public awareness to convey the benefit of \nreforms  will  further  mitigate  this  risk.  Realization  of  RFSDP \nobjectives in the conflict-affected areas is related to improvement \nin operating conditions. In the meanwhile, RFSDP will facilitate the \nactivities of enterprising RFIs in the area and invest in institutional \nstrengthening for rapid expansion as the situation improves.  \n \nResistance  to  RFI  restructuring  has  been  mitigated  through \nupfront  agreement  with  respective  institutions  on  governance \nframework,  support  for  recapitalization,  and  institutional \nstrengthening. Safeguarding against delinquency risk is premised \non tightening credit standards, more attention to credit risk, and \nrigorous  credit  appraisal.  In  addition,  the  Government\u2019s \ncommitment not to interfere in lending and loan collections will \nimprove the repayment culture.  ", "  \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on three proposed \nloans  to  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Rural  Finance  Sector \nDevelopment Program (RFSDP).  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Description and Performance  \n2.   Sri Lanka\u2019s human development index rank (89 out of 173)1 and per capita gross \ndomestic product ($870)2 are by far the highest in South Asia. Sri Lanka\u2019s economic growth rate \nof nearly 5% over the past two decades is above the world average, suggesting resilience \ndespite the civil conflict. Nevertheless, growth has been unevenly distributed and has not been \nfast enough to reduce poverty incidence. Poverty continues to be widespread, with estimates of \n25% to 39%3 of the population in poverty, depending on the level of the underlying poverty line.4 \nThe sizable difference between the estimates indicates that while the former may be classified \nas chronically poor, the latter are vulnerable to chronic poverty or to periods of chronic poverty \ncaused by factors such as unemployment and poor harvests. Even those marginally above the \npoverty line are vulnerable, while the position in the conflict-affected areas5 of the north and the \neast is presumed  to be worse.6 Even though there are wide regional disparities in poverty \nincidence, poverty is overwhelmingly a rural issue.  \n \n3.   Accordingly, the economic reform program7 of the Government of Sri Lanka aims to \nreduce  poverty  by  building  a  supportive  macroeconomic  environment  and  by  helping  to \nestablish lasting peace by relief, rehabilitation, and reconstruction to reduce conflict-related \npoverty. Creating opportunities for the poor to participate in economic growth, empowering the \npoor, and strengthening governance are other strategic foundations of the reforms. Broad-\nbased rural development is the key strategy for poverty reduction including employment and \nincome generation, and access to financial and business services. \n \n4.   High Poverty Concentration in the Rural Sector. The rural sector consists of about \n15 million people, or nearly 80% of the total population of 18.7 million. Using the consumption-\nbased upper poverty line, 88% of the poor live in rural areas, constituting 41% of the rural \npopulation. Income inequality between rural and urban areas is significant. Rural poverty is \nmostly associated with underemployment, as income from both farm and nonfarm sectors, that \n                                                 \n1  United Nations Development Programme.

Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132008):Sri Lanka. Manila. For the interim, the Government \nestimates that poverty in conflict-affected areas will be comparable to Uva province, the poorest province in the \ncountry. This represents 42% of the 1.9 million people estimated to be in the conflict-affected areas in 2001. Final \nresults of the most recent official poverty head count undertaken in 2002 will provide definitive data.  \n7  Regaining Sri Lanka, released in December 2002, outlines the vision and strategy of the Government for \naccelerated development.  Regaining Sri Lanka includes the Government\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy. The \nInternational Monetary Fund approved 3-year arrangements (2003\u20132006) under the Poverty Reduction and Growth \nFacility and Extended Fund Facility amounting to $567 million for Sri Lanka, on 18 April 2003.  \n ", " 2 \n \nprovide 75% of the rural employment, remains below consumption poverty levels. Most of the \npoor are farmers cultivating low-value crops on small plots of land; workers in the fisheries and \nlivestock sectors; workers and the self-employed in remote areas lacking basic amenities; \nlandless workers and craftspeople in low-wage, irregular operations; and squatter settlers and \ndisplaced persons. Slow growth in agricultural productivity and value addition, lack of integration \nwith the mainstream economy, unclear land tenure, social exclusion, and limited access to basic \nsocial services, education, and infrastructure are some of the causes of poverty, along with \ninadequate economic growth and income distribution.8 Only 40% of the rural areas have access \nto electricity, roads, and piped water. The Government owns roughly 80% of the land, two thirds \nof which is used by farmers under various tenure arrangements.  \n \n5.   Gender and Poverty.9 Despite favorable gender indicators compared to the rest of \nSouth Asia, female-headed households and women in conflict-affected areas have emerged as \nthe new vulnerable groups. The most disadvantaged are the women who live in isolated \ncommunities without access to roads, electricity, services, and markets. Female unemployment \nrates are at least double those of men and the majority of women workers are trapped in low \nskill, low-income jobs, and with poor working conditions. Women are primarily unpaid family \nworkers in agriculture. Self-employment and microcredit without access to skills, technology, \nand markets have perpetuated their poverty.  \n \n6.   Stratified  Rural  Finance  Markets.  Rural  finance  (RF)  includes  savings,  credit, \ninsurance, and payment services. RF is broadly segregated into financial services provided to \nrural  farm  and  nonfarm  households,  a  large  number  of  which  are  poor  and  low-income \nhouseholds. Microfinance, as a subset of RF, targets the poor. Considering the demographics of \nSri Lanka, microfinance is primarily rural. On an aggregate level, rural loans for nonpoor \nhouseholds average SLRs250,000 ($2,577). Loans below SLRs100,000 ($1,030) to poor and \nlow-income  households  are  generally  considered  as  micro  loans,  the  average  being \nSLRs19,500 ($200). Based on the consumption yardstick10 of poverty, the RF market may be \nclassified into three broad categories.  \n \n(i)  Lower Rural Poor or Lower Segment. About 25% of the rural population \ncomprising landless, subsistence farmers with an uneconomic holding size; poor \nfishing  communities;  coastal  fisheries  workers;  farm  and  nonfarm  laborers; \nplantation laborers; and those affected by conflict.  \n \n(ii)  Higher Rural Poor or Middle Segment.  About 25% of the rural population, \nmainly comprising petty traders and small and tenant farmers affected by limited \nmarketing avenues, inadequate land tenure arrangements, and infrastructure \nconstraints including road, electricity, and irrigation.  \n \n(iii)  Upper Segment.  Includes commercial farming, large plantations, medium-to-\nlarge rural enterprises, and agriculture produce wholesalers. \n \n7.   Diverse Demand Pattern. Corresponding to the stratified markets (para. 6), the demand \nfor rural credit is diverse both in terms of activities for which credit is sought as well as the type \n                                                 \n8   Regaining Sri Lanka, Annex 2, pp.123-129. \n9  ADB. 2003. Gender Assessment in Sri Lanka. Manila. \n10  Mission estimates based on upper and lower consumption-based poverty lines (footnote 4). The middle segment \nincludes households marginally above the poverty line that are vulnerable to chronic or transient poverty. Poverty \nReduction in Sri Lanka: Issues, Findings, and Approaches  (ADB 2001),  p.4, concludes that nearly half the \npopulation is vulnerable to the risk of consumption poverty. \n  ", "3\nand duration of credit. The upper market segment seeks high-end financial services such as \nletters of credit, export guarantees, and long-term investment capital. The middle segment \nrequires working capital, cash credit, loans against pledge of produce, and medium- to long-\nterm  loans  for  crop  cultivation,  rural  transport,  and  land  development.  The  lower  market \nsegment  requires  credit  for  consumption,  micro  enterprises,  crops,  livestock,  and  minor \nirrigation. The rural poor demand relatively larger loans, compared to the average micro loan \nsize of SLRs19,500, to diversify or increase the scale and scope of their activities.  \n8.   The aggregate demand for rural credit is estimated at SLRs60 billion ($618 million).11 Of \nthis,  the  micro  loan  component  is  SLRs23 billion  ($237 million)  relating  to  2.3 million \nborrowers.12 In addition, the largely undocumented demand for rural credit by an estimated 20% \nfemale-headed households,13 women in conflict-affected areas, poor women including returning \nmigrant  workers,  and  plantation  workers  could  be  significant.  The  major  credit  demand \nemanates from small rural enterprises,14 agriculture and allied sectors including agriculture \nproduction and marketing, farm mechanization, land development, irrigation, livestock, and \nforestry. Sector distribution of rural credit demand15 indicates 50% for the small rural enterprise \nsector, 30% for agriculture and allied sectors, and 20% for the rest. \n9.   As in the case of credit, the demand for savings is diverse with the lower segment \nprimarily seeking rural finance institutions (RFIs) that provide security for their savings. Savings \npotential is immense, given the domestic savings to gross domestic product ratio of 16%. In \naddition, the need for risk mitigation is widely felt. With Sri Lanka receiving $1.1 billion in \nremittances during 2001, there is a significant opportunity for RFIs to tap into this market.  \n10.  Heterogeneous and Proliferating Supply Sources. RF in Sri Lanka, while largely \ngovernment-owned, has one of the most diversified supply sides in the region. A range of \nlegislation governs the diverse range of RFIs16 established for meeting the rural development \nand poverty reduction priorities through credit expansion. The Government\u2019s dominance in RF is \nexercised through ownership and control over pricing of services. The supply sources comprise: \n \n(i)  Formal, i.e., those supervised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL)\u2014632 \nrural branches of commercial banks, 56 rural branches of National Savings Bank, \n6  regional  development  banks  (RDBs)  with  191  branches,  and  SANASA \nDevelopment Bank (SDB) with 8 branches.  \n \n(ii)  Semiformal,17 those established or registered under secondary rules of various \nlegislation  but  not  supervised  by  CBSL:  National  Development  Trust  Fund \n(NDTF); 311 cooperative rural banks (CRBs) with 1,196 outlets; 8,500 thrift and \n                                                 \n11 Aggregate demand estimates exclude the conflict-affected areas and informal arrangements. \n12 ADB. 2002. Commercialization of Microfinance in Sri Lanka. Manila.  \n13  ADB.1999. County Briefing Paper. Women in Sri Lanka. Manila. \n14 Agriculture-related  enterprises  include  small-scale  processing  of  agriculture  produce  and  byproducts  into \nsemifinished and finished goods, and production and supply of agricultural inputs. Nonfarm enterprises include \nbasic transport, handicraft, and weaving.  \n15 Published aggregate RF statistics are unavailable. This classification is based on Central Bank of Sri Lanka \nstatistics and the disbursement pattern of ADB-funded and other external agency-funded projects.  \n16  The wide range of RF providers have been given a broad classification for clarity. In this document, unless \notherwise specified, RFIs collectively denote RDBs, SDB, and the entire range of semiformal RFIs including MF-\nNGOs. The term \u201cRF\u201d or \u201cRFI\u201d is thus inclusive of \u201cmicrofinance\u201d or \u201cmicrofinance institution\u201d, respectively. The \nterm \u201cmicrofinance\u201d or \u201cmicrofinance institution\u201d is used only for specific microfinance-related reference. Likewise, \nwherever relevant, commercial banks are specifically mentioned.  \n17  In addition, there are other small-scale financing organizations such as the Tea Shakti Foundation and savings and \ncredit societies organized under farmer organizations. \n ", " 4 \n \ncredit cooperative societies (TCCSs); 970 Samurdhi banking societies (SBSs); \napproximately  200  microfinance  nongovernment  organizations  (MF-NGOs); \nnumerous government rural credit programs; pawnshops; and 4,042 post offices \nthat collect savings, often in collaboration with National Savings Bank. \n \n(iii)  Informal or Noninstitutional, such as rotating savings and credit associations, \ninput suppliers, traders, moneylenders, landlords, friends, and relatives. \n \n11.  Commercial banks primarily serve the upper segment of the RF market and partially the \nmiddle segment. Commercial bank participation in the middle and lower segments of the RF \nmarket are generally through government programs. Semiformal RFIs focus on the middle and \nlower  segments  and  the  MF-NGOs  target  the  most  vulnerable  sections  within  the  lower \nsegment. While the most numerous, the intermittent nature of credit from informal sources \nmainly caters to immediate consumption and contingencies. Interest charges in the informal \nsources are too high to leave any households surplus. Poor women are confined to subsistence \nactivities  with  access  only  to  informal  sources  of  credit.  Their  weak  bargaining  power \nsignificantly raises the cost of credit to them. \n \n12.  Linked in a complex of relationships, the formal and semiformal sources meet nearly \nthree fourths of the rural credit demand and provide saving facilities in most, if not all, parts of \nthe country. Total rural loans outstanding with RFIs and commercial banks at end-2001 were \nSLRs50 billion. The total number of active micro loans, including those with MF-NGOs, is \n1.65 million,  with  an  outstanding  amount  of  SLRs18.23 billion.  In  addition  to  micro  loans, \nworking capital, trade finance, investment credit, crop loans, and savings facilities are the most \ncommon services provided. Lending interest rates are in the range of 14\u201316% for state-owned \ncommercial banks, 20\u201322% for private commercial banks, and 18\u201328% for others. Supply of \nrisk mitigation and remittance services is affected by lack of explicit legal basis for extending \nsuch services by RFIs. (A sector and subsector analysis is in Appendix 1.) \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities  \n \n13.  A  vibrant  rural  economy  requires  robust  RF  markets  that  can  efficiently  allocate \nresources and facilitate exchange of goods and services. Efficient RF markets contribute to \npoverty reduction through enabling rural households to respond to economic and technological \nopportunities that generate employment in farm and rural enterprises and establish forward and \nbackward  linkages  in  the  rural  economy.  However,  politicization  has  weakened  both the \ncommercial banks and RFIs. Bank of Ceylon and the People\u2019s Bank, the two largest state-\nowned commercial banks with half the banking sector assets and branches, have gone through \nsuccessive  institutional-strengthening  processes  for  restoring  capital  adequacy, enhancing \nefficiency,  and  reducing  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs).  While  Bank  of  Ceylon  has  shown \nimprovements, the People\u2019s Bank has a capital adequacy of 11%. Its provision for loan losses \ncovers only 60% of the NPLs and the repayment rate for rural credit is approximately 75%.18 \nBoth these banks are being restructured with World Bank and ADB19 assistance. Some private \ndomestic banks also reflect weak governance and financial status. \n \n14.  RFIs  also  have  pervasive  weaknesses  and  suffer  from  weak  governance,  high \ntransaction  costs,  and  recurring  losses  that  add  to  the  fiscal  burden.  Very  few  RFIs  are \n                                                 \n18  Repayment rate in this document refers to collection as a percentage of loans due. \n19 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on two Proposed Loans to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Private Sector Development Program. Manila  \n  ", "5\nfinancially self-sufficient and repayment rates go as low as 60%. RFIs are not even subject to \nbasic prudential standards, and regulatory mechanisms for semiformal RFIs are inadequate, \ndespite their mobilization of billions of SLRs as savings from millions of small depositors. The \nlonger these problems remain neglected the more intractable they will become, as evident from \nthe decade-long reforms of the commercial banks. Immediate and concerted efforts are required \nto address systemic issues in the RF sector. \n \n1.  Policies and Sector Plan \n \n15.  In the absence of a dedicated policy, the RF sector is heavily fragmented with RFIs that \nreflect weak governance and grossly inadequate institutional capacity. In particular, a history of \nad hoc public sector interventions at the national and, increasingly, provincial levels has resulted \nin an uncontrolled proliferation of fundamentally weak RFIs. As a result, tolerance for loan \ndefaults, waivers, and postponements has gradually increased.20 Consequently, repayment \nrates  remain  low  and  sustainability  of  RFIs  has  suffered.  Populist  government  programs \npromote financing of activities that generate insufficient  as well as temporary economic and \nsocial benefits. Major issues in RF, such as regulation for deposit protection, receive inadequate \nattention and there is no institutionalized mechanism to coordinate RF interventions with rural \nand agriculture sector policies. In this environment, private sector investments in RF have \nremained marginal. A policy framework is required for redefining the Government\u2019s role in RF to \nfacilitate the functioning of RF markets and to create the right incentives for greater private \nsector participation in RF.  \n \n  2.   Supervisory and Regulatory Framework  \n \n16.  The absence of a policy and supervisory framework has allowed the proliferation of \nfundamentally  unsustainable  RFIs  under  various  laws,  which  (i) enables  government \ninterventions in product and pricing decisions, weakens governance, and diminishes institutional \nautonomy; (ii) exacerbates the lack of enforcement of financial prudence; (iii) strengthens the \ntendency to operate on regulatory arbitrage; (iv) does not provide  for transformation of MF-\nNGOs  into  depository  institutions  or  regularize  their  savings  activities;  and  (v) inhibits \ndiversification of services that require a distinct legal mandate, such as remittances. \n \n17.  Accounting  standards,  management  information  system  (MIS),  and  information \ntechnology  (IT)  platforms  are  rudimentary.  As  a  result,  institutional  information  is  both \ninadequate and unreliable. Most semiformal RFIs are inadequately supervised, if at all, putting \nthe savings of millions of rural households at risk. The proliferation of semiformal RFIs makes it \ndifficult  to  institute  an  effective  supervisory  mechanism.  Considering  the  banking  sector \nweaknesses (para. 13), CBSL is rightly focusing on banks, which hold the bulk of banking sector \nassets. In addition, CBSL supervision for semiformal RFIs is not a cost-effective option. An \neffective response is to stem the proliferation of RFIs through a stricter entry threshold and \noperating standards, preferably through a cost-effective second-tier agency.  \n \n  3.  Training Arrangements for Rural Finance \n \n18.   While RFIs have proliferated, there is a lack of affordable high-quality training for \nmainstreaming RF best practices. CBSL\u2019s Center for Banking Studies (CBS) and International \n                                                 \n20  Sustainability refers to the ability to provide high-quality financial services to existing and potential clients on a \npermanent basis without the need for government or donor support. This also implies a for-profit orientation in \nadministration and operations to attract equity investments and mobilize savings and commercial borrowings.  \n ", " 6 \n \nCentre  for  Training  of  Rural  Leaders  offer  limited  training  on  RF.  Sarvaodaya  Economic \nEnterprise  Development  Services  Management  Training  Institute  and  SANASA  Training \nInstitute  are  dedicated  facilities.  The  Rural  Development  Training  Institute  provides  some \ntraining on delivery of RF and social services. Universities do not offer courses specifically on \nRF or microfinance. None of these institutions currently offers a comprehensive curriculum that \nis consistent with RF best practices, which is a requirement of the majority of RFIs and even of \ncommercial banks. Further, semiformal RFIs are unaware of their need for such training. \nAddressing the training needs of the RF sector, including those of policy makers and regulators, \nwill have to be prioritized for effective institutional reform.  \n \n  4.  Institutional Sustainability  \n \n19.  Irrespective of the type of RFI, the financial and operational results of the majority of \nRFIs fail to conform to internationally accepted standards for sustainability and the financial \nviability of RFIs in general is deteriorating. Supporting unviable entities is an increasing but \navoidable strain on government resources. Outreach of RFIs has come at the cost of portfolio \nquality and continuity of RF services is not yet assured for many rural households.  \n \n20.  Regional Development Banks. Established under the Regional Development Bank Act \nof 1985, RDBs are owned by the Government, CBSL, commercial banks, and CBSL Employee \nProvident Fund. The RDBs primarily focus on the middle and lower segments of the RF markets \nwith nearly 80% of their loans below SLRs100,000 (Appendix 2). Aggregate deposits and \noutstanding  loans  at  end-2001  were  SLRs4.7 billion  and  SLRs5.5 billion, respectively. By \nvolume, the RDBs provide approximately 18% of all micro loans. The orientation of RDB staff is \ninappropriate for banking with the poor. Overall portfolio quality remains weak. NPLs among the \nsix RDBs range from 16% to 33%. Continued weaknesses in RDBs could affect the safety of \ndeposits, and consequently diminish RDBs\u2019 image and business prospects. Nevertheless, RDBs \nrepresent a significant formal financial sector presence in rural areas and there is considerable \npotential for them to enhance their role in the RF sector. A holistic restructuring is required for \nimproving governance, credit policies and products, and human resource management. \n \n21.  Cooperative Rural Banks. CRBs are member-based institutions (Appendix 3). Of the \n311 CRBs, 306 are departments of multipurpose cooperative societies and five CRBs are stand-\nalone institutions. There are 1,196 CRB outlets. In addition, 14 apex district CRB unions pool \nCRB surpluses for investments. CRBs collectively mobilized SLRs16.6 billion at end-2001 in \n5.8 million savings accounts. Their loans outstanding at end-2001 were SLRs5.9 billion at an \naverage loan size of SLRs8,500. CRBs provide nearly one third of the total micro loans. While \nmultipurpose cooperative societies come under the purview of the Cooperative Societies Act of \n1972,  the  CRBs,  as  departments  in  these  societies,  are  neither  subject  to  any  effective \nindependent supervision nor do they file separate accounts. Governance is a key issue, as \nCRBs suffer from political capture by local interests. While between half and two thirds of the \nCRBs are reportedly viable, their performance varies.21 The aggregate repayment rate is only \n65%.  The  performance  of  the  stand-alone  CRBs  is  somewhat  better.  Because  of  the \nwidespread nature of problems, any failure of CRBs will put the savings, of which two thirds are \nfrom nonmembers, at risk. About SLRs7 billion ($72 million) of CRB resources are considered at  \nrisk due to bad investments and poor portfolio quality. \n \n22.  The 8,500 registered TCCSs, with an estimated membership of 905,106, are federated \ninto a nationwide network involving 33 district unions and a national federation of TCCSs \n                                                 \n21 In the absence of independent accounts, it is difficult to precisely indicate the financial status.  \n  ", "7\n(Appendix 3). In total, 252,682 loans amounting to SLRs2.8 billion were outstanding as of end-\n2000. Women accounted for 55% of clients, with an average loan size of SLRs12,000. The \nTCCS federation has no central management and does not act as a regulator or supervisor, or \neven as an effective coordinator. The TCCSs suffer from weak accounting and MIS, and their \nsystems and procedures are often incompatible across the primary, district, and national levels. \nThe majority of TCCSs are considered to be dormant.  \n \n23.  Commercial Banks. Beyond government programs, commercial banks also provide RF \nservices in the normal course of business. In terms of volume, commercial banks constitute two \nthirds of aggregate rural credit and are the main providers of term credit for rural enterprises. \nWhile private commercial banks aggressively look for profitable RF business niches, they tend \nto concentrate on large loans. The state-owned commercial banks, on the other hand, will have \nto, on a priority basis, rationalize their RF operations to alter their target-driven approach, and \nshed accumulated overheads and inefficiencies. Expansion of RF operations is in the long-term \ninterest of commercial banks, as urban banking centers are becoming overcrowded. \n \n24.  The restructuring of the state-owned commercial banks and greater participation of \nprivate commercial banks in rural areas are essential to enhance the supply of rural credit for \nrapid income expansion through rural enterprise financing. Systemic linkages with MF-NGOs \ncould cost-effectively drive commercial bank expansion in microfinance. Currently, microfinance \nexposure  of  commercial  banks  is  limited  to  government  programs.  Commercial  bank \nparticipation in government sponsored subsidized credit programs crowds out the private sector \nbanks. Despite this, some private commercial banks, especially Hatton National Bank, Seylan \nBank, and Sampath Bank have made genuine attempts through innovative pilot schemes to \nenlarge their microfinance portfolio. People\u2019s Bank is also implementing a rural innovation \nproject funded by Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ); this project \nneeds to be mainstreamed and replicated by other commercial banks. Improvements in staff \norientation, as well as skills for credit appraisal, delivery, and monitoring will serve to enlarge the \nscope of commercial bank participation in RF on a commercial basis.  \n \n25.  Apex Agencies.  In addition to savings and participation in government and external \nagency-funded  programs,  RFIs  access  refinance  assistance  for  onlending.  NDTF  was \nestablished in 1992 under the Poverty Alleviation Program22 as an apex agency for providing \ntechnical and refinance assistance for microfinance (Appendix 4). Most of NDTF\u2019s operations \nwere wound up in 1998, though it continued its microfinance refinancing activities. It is the \nprimary  lender  to  MF-NGOs,  but  its  lending  is  small  compared  with  its  resources \n(SLRs1.07 billion) and potential demand. At end-June 2002, NDTF had 160 partner RFIs, of \nwhich  81  were  actively  borrowing,  and  an  outstanding  loan  portfolio  of  SLRs597.1 million \n($6.2 million). NDTF\u2019s on-time loan repayment rate is about 88%. NDTF performance has been \nlow due to (i) weaknesses in selection of target institutions, credit assessment, and portfolio \nmanagement; (ii) difficulties in promoting viable micro enterprises in an environment of low \neconomic growth, segmented markets, and serious infrastructure bottlenecks; (iii) institutional \ninadequacies of client RFIs and commercial banks; and (iv) weak capacity for RF institution \nbuilding. Fundamental reforms are required to enhance NDTF\u2019s capacity, including changes in \nits incorporation, governance, client selection, and pricing practices. Only after this will NDTF be \nable to act as a focal point for development of the MF-NGOs.  \n \n26.  As a specialized bank owned by the TCCSs, SDB (Appendix 3) mobilizes deposits \nthrough 10 branches for lending primarily through selected TCCSs (para. 22). As a result, SDB \n                                                 \n22 Funded by World Bank ($20 million), Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau ($10 million), and the Government ($5 million). \n ", " 8 \n \nis filling the gap created by the weak TCCS federation. As of end-June 2001, SDB had 6,270 \nmicro loans with a value of SLRs127.5 million ($1.3 million). SDB potential is largely dependent \non the absorptive capacity of TCCSs, which is rapidly decreasing. SDB has to simultaneously \ngear for enhancing direct lending activities and concentrate only on viable TCCSs. At present, \nSDB\u2019s institutional capacities are similar to RDBs\u2019.  \n \n5.  Government Interventions  \n \n27.  Government interventions include micro loans through commercial banks and several \ngovernment-sponsored, often external agency-funded, rural credit programs especially for rural \npoor. CBSL and Samurdhi Authority are the executing agencies of nearly 30 such programs. \nCBSL supervises some external agency-funded and government rural credit programs that \ninclude interest subsidy schemes. While a developmental role of CBSL is justified to a degree, \nthe  nature  of  its  current  involvement  perpetuate  outmoded  RF paradigm inconsistent with \nsustainable RF and is also a conflict of interest with its supervisory function. While government \nprograms have averted severe poverty, political interference and weak design have encouraged \ndependence on below-cost credit and induced poor repayment behavior.23  \n28.  The Samurdhi Program governed by the Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka Act No. 30 of \n1995 is the main poverty reduction program, and has two main components (Appendix 5). The \nfirst set comprises welfare programs and subsidized lending programs through state-owned \ncommercial  banks.  The  second,  SBS  program  that  began  in  1997,  has  970  SBSs.  With \n1.7 million families as members, the SBS program reaches about 50% of all households. \nWomen hold two thirds of the share in SBSs. Member and nonmember capital and savings \namount to SLRs6.7 billion, and the total outstanding loans at end- 2001 were SLRs2.3 billion \nwith 429,231 active loans. A credit guarantee scheme and two insurance schemes complement \nSBS.  However,  weak  management  and  lack  of  effective  supervision  have  weakened  the \nsystem. Despite a repayment rate of 93.4% and a 3% per month interest rate on loans, three \nfourths of SBSs are nonviable due to administrative overheads that require recurring budgetary \nsupport. Governance and transparency are major and immediate concerns.  \n  \n6.  Legal  Status  and  Institutional  Capacity  of  Microfinance-Nongovernment \nOrganizations \n \n29.  The poorest groups are reached only by way of group-guaranteed loans, which are \nmainly  provided  by  MF-NGOs  (Appendix 6).  A  high  proportion  of  microfinance  in  conflict-\naffected areas is provided by MF-NGOs. However, the majority of MF-NGOs, which number \naround 200, are operationally and financially weak. Fewer than five have profitable operations.24 \nThe  largest  MF-NGO,  Sarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Services,  commonly \nknown as SEEDS, provides loans in the range $100\u2013550, and at end-March 2001 had 177,974 \nactive loan clients with an outstanding loan portfolio of SLRs667 million. Janashakthi has 67 \nsocieties comprising 28,168 women in 464 village societies that pool individual and group \nsavings to extend small loans. Savings and loans outstanding amount to SLRs29 million and \nSLRs91 million, respectively. The Social Mobilization Fund, Arthachariya Foundation, and Agro \nmart are middle-sized MF-NGOs with 3,000\u201310,000 clients. The rest are small MF-NGOs with \nportfolio in the range of $10,000\u201340,000. MF-NGOs require substantial improvements in credit \nappraisal, supervision and monitoring, and loan-delinquency management.  \n                                                 \n23  S.

Background paper for the World Bank Sri Lanka Poverty Assessment; and \nUNDP. 1998. Sri Lanka National Development Report.  \n24  Lack of transparency and standardized financial reporting impede a detailed assessment.  \n  ", "9\n \n30.  Most  of  the  small  MF-NGOs  are  focused  on  broader  social  objectives,  and  give \ninadequate priority to improving their financial intermediation skills, especially in the areas of \nfinancial analysis, strategic planning, and governance. Substantial support under government \nand external agency-funded programs perpetuate this orientation leading to a widespread \nculture of dependence, a high-cost structure, and abrupt discontinuation after program closure. \nDespite not being legally permitted,25 most MF-NGOs mobilize savings and would collapse if \nthey did not do this. Therefore, there is a need to create an appropriate legal structure (para. 17) \nwith adaptations to recognize and accommodate their distinctive operations. The MF-NGOs \nshould be allowed opportunities for accessing loan funds and institutional strengthening support, \nprovided that they demonstrate significant interest in sustainable microfinance.  \n   \n  7.  Demand and Supply Gap for Rural Credit  \n \n31.  While there is a wide RFI network, the estimated gap between demand and supply for \nrural  credit  is  around  SLRs10 billion  ($103 million)  at  the  current  lending  interest  rates \n(para. 12). The credit supply could be higher by an estimated SLRs3 billion ($31 million), if the \nconstraints imposed by limited access to medium- to long-term credit were removed. Within the \noverall gap, an estimated SLRs4.7 billion in 0.65 million accounts is for micro loans for the rural \npoor, at an average of SLRs20,000. However, this segment is restricted to borrowing amounts \nlower than that required for generating household surpluses to cross the subsistence and \npoverty thresholds. It is also difficult for this segment to obtain larger and longer-term loans in \nthe range of SLRs50,000\u2013100,000 for investing in fixed assets for expansion and diversification \nof  their  sources  of  income.  Supply  gaps  are  also  marked  for  (i) loans of approximately \nSLRs200,000\u20131 million, but particularly in the range of SLRs250,000\u2013300,000, the \u201cmissing \nmiddle\u201d,26 that is neither a microfinance clientele nor adequately served by the commercial \nbanks, and (ii) term loans of 2\u20135 years. The demand could be still higher with lower interest \nrates, which could be possible with decreased government presence in the debt market.  \n \n8.  Rural Finance in Conflict-Affected Areas  \n \n32.  Access to RF services is inadequate in the conflict-affected areas. To a great extent, \nformal sources of RF dried up during the conflict. The advent of the peace process provides an \nopportunity  for  customized  response  that  incorporates  best  practices,  innovations  in  RF \ndelivery,  and  local  adaptations  to  cater  to  the  unique  social  and  cultural  conditions.  The \nchallenge is to support both the establishment of an institutional structure that will be able to \nprovide quality financial services on a permanent basis as well as meeting the immediate \nfinancing  needs  of  rural  households.  While  the  financing  of  household  income-generating \nactivities is important, it is equally important to support rural entrepreneurs who could generate \nlocal employment. Considering that institutions and infrastructure have been destroyed or badly \nneglected due to two decades of conflict, the need for simultaneous investments in the real \nsector  and  for  capacity  building  of  communities  is  critical  for  a  sustainable  RF  sector. \nSequencing the delivery of RF services with the ongoing and planned reconstruction efforts is \nimportant for maximizing the development impact.  \n \n                                                 \n25  Under the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 and the Finance Companies Act no. 78 of 1988, an institution must be \nlicensed as a bank or a finance company to collect deposits from either members or nonmembers. \n26 ADB. 2000. Rural Financial Markets in Asia: Policies, Paradigms and Performance. Manila. This is volume 3 of \nStudy of Rural Asia, ADB, 2000, published by Oxford University Press. The \u201cmissing middle\u201d in the context of Sri \nLanka broadly relates to activities such as repair shops, foundries, rural transport, trade, manufacture of small farm \nequipment, supply of high-yielding seeds and fertilizers, and irrigation facilities.  \n ", " 10 \n \n9.  Demand-Side Development \n   \n33.  Production and marketing bottlenecks due to weak rural infrastructure accentuate the \nrisks in RF and reduce the profitability of the rural enterprises as well as RFIs. Low prices and \npoor productivity make it difficult for the rural sector to compete for investment capital against \nurban and industrial projects. In addition, the absence of forward and backward linkages to \nsupport value addition to rural produce impedes diversification of income sources. Low skill \nlevels among clients in the lower segment of the RF market and the absence of risk mitigation \nmechanisms not only create risk aversion but also impair the ability of the rural poor to \neffectively utilize the availability of RF, equitably participate in the local economy, and reduce \nvulnerability to economic downturns and natural calamities. The impact of these has kept a \nlarge part of the rural economy at subsistence levels, resulting in a high poverty incidence. \n \n34.  Addressing these demand-side issues is costly, and its \u201cpublic good\u201d nature makes it \ndifficult to attract private sector investments. The microfinance-plus27 approach adopted by MF-\nNGOs and RFIs for addressing demand-side issues by factoring associated costs in the lending \ninterest rate has the unintended impact of leaving little, if any, household surplus for the rural \npoor. The microfinance-plus approach through limited external agency-funding has also led to \nambiguous social and financial intermediation goals, with little sustainable impact. Recognizing \nthese, the Government recently set up a Rural Economy Resuscitation Fund (RERF) in the \nMinistry of Rural Economy (MRE) for supporting demand-side development with investments in \nsmall community-based infrastructure, skills, and marketing. Fiscal squeeze has, however, not \nallowed allocation of adequate resources, which impairs the potential benefits to the RF sector.  \n \n35.  Lessons Learned. The weak sector performance confirms the lessons learned that (i) a \nsupportive policy, legal, and regulatory framework is required for an orderly and systematic \nsector development; (ii) below-cost lending interest rates result in misallocation of resources \nand production inefficiencies; (iii) prolonged subsidy dependence undermines sustainability and \nintegration with financial markets; and (iv) inadequate rural infrastructure and a low skills base \ndepress rural incomes, which in turn adversely affect RF markets. Like other countries in the \nregion, credit expansion is not accompanied by quality services, and inadequate availability of \nmedium- to long-term rural credit persists. Where state-owned RFIs have failed, the private \nsector has not stepped in to fill the institutional and resource gaps.  \n \n36.  Client perspectives in Sri Lanka suggest that (i) the lending interest rate is secondary to \navailability and accessibility;28 (ii) the amount and term of credit available can only sustain \npresent income levels, not enable the rural poor to cross successive income thresholds; and \n(iii) physical collateral requirements impede the ability to upscale rural enterprises. There is a \ngrowing consensus that rural poverty could be reduced rapidly by replacing welfare-orientation \nwith market-based systems. The Government is also committed to the ongoing economic reform \nprogram that emphasizes private sector-led growth and structural reforms in the financial sector. \nRF reforms will be better accomplished as part of a broader economic reform agenda.  \n                                                 \n27 Core financial intermediation functions relate to delivery of RF services. Rural including micro loans are delivered \neither through individuals or groups, the latter being formed with the intention to reduce delivery cost and build peer \npressure. The microfinance-plus approach, on the other hand, covers skills and literacy training, enterprise training, \nleadership and empowerment training, provision of community infrastructure, procurement and marketing support, \nand risk mitigation. Extremely important and relevant as these are for social capital formation, they remain much \nbeyond the capacity of MF-NGOs or RFIs to deliver and administer in a meaningful, sustainable, and cost-effective \nmanner. In the process, neither social nor financial objectives are sustainably realized. \n28  For those used to below cost credit, the obvious expectation is a continuation of the current situation. \n  ", "11\n37.  Overall Rationale. The rural sector supports the bulk of the population\u2014the majority of \nthe poor\u2014and thus is the largest market for financial services in terms of number of clients. \nImpressive as the RF outreach is, it contrasts sharply with the deteriorating operational and \nfinancial status of RFIs. The demand and supply gap, still greater potential demand, and \nregional disparities in RF service delivery are largely unattended. Instead of mainstreaming \ngovernance and sustainability as core values, successive governments have adopted ad hoc \nmeasures that exacerbated the weaknesses. The contribution of RF in diversification into new \nfarm and nonfarm opportunities and value addition in the rural sector remains unfulfilled. As a \nresult, the rural sector is trapped in low-risk and low-return investments. This will widen income \ngaps both within rural areas and relative to urban areas, and will have long-term negative \neffects on consumption and asset buildup, especially among rural poor households.  \n \n38.   A  sustainable  RF  system  is  a  critical  element  of  successful  rural  economies.  The \ncreation of an effective and efficient RF system is conditional on the removal of systemic \nconstraints and promotion of market-driven responses for providing appropriate products and \nservices. This will only be possible if pursued with sustained commitment to establishing a \nfacilitating policy, legal, and institutional framework. The financial drain in supporting weak RFIs \nand likely contingent liabilities has prompted the Government to seek viable RFIs. The ongoing \nreforms supported by the World Bank and ADB, which are aimed at restructuring commercial \nbanks and introducing stricter prudential norms, provide a positive context for reforms in the RF \nsector. Success will still, though, depend on improvements in the macroeconomic climate and \nsimultaneously addressing real sector issues. Access to RF at lower transaction cost is also \nimportant  for  successfully  leveraging  employment  and  enterprise  opportunities  in  an \nenvironment in which World Trade Organization regulations are applied. \n \nIII.   THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \n39.  The Government\u2019s aim is to reduce poverty incidence to from 25% to 20% and attain an \neconomic growth rate of nearly 7% by 2005. The Government\u2019s economic reform program \nhighlights  the  role  of  RF  in  empowering  the  poor,  especially  women,  and  emphasizes \nsustainability of RFIs, their integration with the financial sector, and the development of an \nintegrated  policy  and  legal  framework  for  MF-NGOs.  The  poverty  partnership  agreement \nbetween the Government and ADB emphasizes  on employment generation, pro-poor asset \ncreation, promotion of RF intermediation, and a larger role of the private sector for sustainable \ngrowth.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  underlines  the  need  for  a  suitable  regulatory \nframework for RFIs and greater access to RF through RFIs, including MF-NGOs.  \n \n40.  A systemic response to address the issues in RF is essential for reviving the rural \neconomy through investments in agriculture and rural enterprises for promoting private sector-\nled  economic  growth  to  generate  employment  opportunities  and  reduce  poverty.  The \nGovernment is committed to introducing progressive policies for the development of the RF \nsector and protecting it from being used for short-term political gains. To accomplish this, an \nintegrated package of policy, institutional development, and outreach expansion is needed \nalong with strong commitment to pursue reforms. The sector development program modality \nhas thus been chosen to facilitate the adoption of sector reforms to ensure that an adequate \npolicy and legal framework is in place to optimize investments in institutional strengthening and \noutreach. RFSDP formulation was closely coordinated with various stakeholders, including \nCBSL, and representatives of the private sector, NGOs, and development partners. RFSDP is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s projects for strengthening nonbank financial services, small and medium \nenterprises, and the private sector. RFSDP develops synergies with ongoing ADB-funded social \nand agriculture sector interventions (Appendix 7). The agreements on RFSDP are reflected in \n ", " 12 \n \nthe  Government\u2019s  development  policy  letter  and  policy  matrix  (Appendix 8). The program \nframework is in Appendix 9 and a RF sector roadmap is in Supplementary Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope  \n41.  RFSDP is designed to contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. The goal is \nto enhance outreach of sustainable RF services. The objective is to establish a sustainable RF \nsystem through policy adjustments to eliminate structural constraints to growth of the RF sector \nand  to  improve  the  operations  of  RFIs.  Institutionalizing  policies  that  emphasize  good \ngovernance  will  yield  considerable  benefits  in  terms  of  fostering  a  long-term  sector-wide \nperspective for sustainability. The investments in RF will be able to generate adequate returns \nin terms of rural growth and value addition. Further, efficient delivery of RF services adapted to \nthe nature of demand will ensure the viability of RFIs as well as of the rural enterprises that they \nserve. A positive RF environment will encourage private sector involvement in RF, which could \nsupplement and facilitate RF outreach in conflict-affected areas.  \n \n42.  RFSDP consists of a program loan and two project loans. The policy reforms will \nestablish an institutional framework for RF, with good governance and sustainability as core \nvalues.  The  project  loans  will  assist  in  strengthening  institutional  capacity  for  enhancing \noutreach.  The  scope  of  the  RF  reforms  will  include  policy,  governance,  institutions,  and \noutreach. The range of interventions required in the RF sector is much beyond what could \nreasonably be covered within the span of RFSDP. Therefore, the scope of interventions has \nbeen determined based on RFI commitment to reforms, cost-effectiveness, significance of \ncontribution to RF sector development, and replicability.  \n \nB.  The Program Loan  \n1.  Objectives \n \n43.  Major policy issues in the RF sector are covered by the program loan. The program loan \ngoals are to ensure enhanced access by the rural households to RF services; good governance \nof RFIs; reduction in the role of the public sector; and increase in the role of the private sector, \nincluding MF-NGOs, in RF. The specific objective is to develop a sustainable RF system for \nproviding efficient services, primarily to the middle and lower segments of the RF markets, for \nsignificant income expansion and poverty reduction impact.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs  \n \n44.  The program loan has five components: (i) conducive policies, (ii) supportive legal and \nregulatory framework, (iii) institutional reforms for sustainability, (iv) strengthening the demand \nside, and (v) expansion of RF in conflict-affected areas.  \n \na.  Conducive Policies  \n \n45.  Parallel  to  ongoing  commercial  bank  reforms,  the  policy  for  the  promotion  of  RF \n(Appendix 8) includes the following: \n \n(i)  establishing a high-level body for coordinating RF sector policies;  \n \n(ii)  improving RF sector supervision and regulation;  \n \n  ", "13\n(iii)  expediting the recovery of dues;  \n   \n(iv)  phasing out CBSL\u2019s role in RF that raises conflict of interest; \n \n(v)  instituting fundamental RFI reforms in CRBs, RDBs, NDTF, and SBSs; \n \n(vi)  curtailing government actions to pardon and discourage debt recovery; \n \n(vii)  ensuring that RFIs have autonomy to price their services; \n \n(viii)  enhancing investments for demand-side development; and \n   \n(ix)  promoting linkages between RFIs, NGOs, and community-based organizations. \n \n  b.  Supportive Legal and Regulatory Framework  \n \n46.  As part of RFSDP, the Rural Finance Sector Development Act (the RFSD Act) will be \npassed to consolidate the  fragmented, ineffective, and dormant  supervisory and regulatory \nmechanisms (paras. 16 and 17). The RFSD Act will be applicable to those RFIs, including MF-\nNGOs, which are not covered by the Banking Act of 1988 and are not under CBSL purview. The \nRFSD Act will: (i) provide for the establishment of a Rural Finance Sector Development Agency \n(RFSDA) for the supervision and regulation of RFIs not supervised by CBSL; (ii) prescribe the \nfunctions  of  and  prohibitions  on  the  various  categories  of  RFIs;  (iii) lay  down  licensing \nprocedures  and  requirements;  (iv) set  out  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  standards  and \nsystems; (v) list the prudential requirements, including disclosure and reporting requirements; \nand (vi) outline the process of establishing and winding up RFIs.  \n \n47.  RFSDA will also serve as the nodal RF policy body for taking a holistic approach to RF \nsector issues, periodically reviewing sector developments, coordinating and guiding appropriate \ngovernment interventions in RF, and maintaining a national database on RF. The RFSD Act \nprogressively allows eligible RFIs, based on their institutional and financial capacity, to provide a \nwide range of services, including risk mitigation, remittances, and pledges. The RFSD Act \nmakes RFIs liable for the security of deposits. Summary features, text of the RFSD Act, and \nimplementation plan (Supplementary Appendix 2) were developed with extensive consultation \nwith stakeholders, including the Government, CBSL, RFIs, and MF-NGOs.  \n \n48.  The RFSD Act allows RFSDA to have only 10 staff. On-site and off-site supervision will \nbe undertaken primarily through approved private sector auditors and audit firms29 engaged at a \nfee to be paid by RFIs in a phased manner. This will eliminate the need for a large staff \ncomplement and ensure appropriate cost-effective supervision that allows operating flexibility to \nRFIs.  Considering  the  disarray  of  the  RF  sector,  due  diligence  of  RFIs  will  precede  the \napplication  of  RFSDA  provisions.  Adequate  transition  time  will  be  given  to  RFIs  for  full \ncompliance. Considering the large number of eligible RFIs, RFSDA will initially set a threshold in \nterms of savings and loan size to limit its coverage to larger RFIs. Supervisory reach will \ngradually grow. While RFSDA will initially focus on CRBs, the immediate benefit  will be the \nopportunity for eligible MF-NGOs to operate within a framework that recognizes the distinct \nnature of their operations, particularly savings mobilization and noncollateralized assets.  \n                                                 \n29 Those qualified and registered as auditors, including those registered with the Institute of Chartered Accountants. \nRFI appraisal skills of auditors will be developed using the Project Loan proceeds (para. 79).  \n ", " 14 \n \n49.  Mechanisms for recovery of defaults will be strengthened through an in-depth review of \nthe legal and institutional framework for recovery of debts from RFI defaulters and developing \nand implementing an action plan to facilitate expeditious recovery of debts from such defaulters, \nconsistent with the principles of due process. This will encourage RFIs to expand their credit \nportfolio, thereby benefiting the rural economy. \n \nc.  Institutional Reforms for Sustainability  \n \n50.  RFSDP  will  support  reforms  for  CRB,  RDBs,  NDTF,  and  SBSs,  whose  combined \noutreach for micro loans is nearly 65% of the market. In view of the challenging responsibility, \ninstitutional reforms have been phased, among others, to correspond to RFSDP-supported \ncapacity for managing the change process.  To ensure effective utilization of  resources, the \noverriding  principles  for  RFSDP  assistance  for  institutional  reforms  are:  (i) demonstrated \ncommitment  of  RFIs  to  sustainability  and  good  governance;  (ii) timely completion by the \ninstitutions  of  agreed  actions;  and  (iii) adherence  to  restructuring/institutional strengthening \nbenchmarks by the institutions. The intention is not to abruptly close or disrupt RFIs, but to \nassist their transformation into sustainable entities and provide adequate deposit protection.  \n \n51.  Cooperative Rural Bank Reforms.  The Ministry of Co-operatives (MOC), as part of \nRFSDP, has adopted a CRB Restructuring Policy including a model CRB Restructuring Plan \nand  CRB  Fund  Rules  (Supplementary  Appendix 3).  The  first  stage  of  CRB  reforms  will \ncommence with the preparation of the restructuring plan for participating CRBs covering (i) due \ndiligence  process  for  demarcating  assets  and  liabilities  between  the  parent  multipurpose \ncooperative society and the participating CRB, (ii) constitution of the CRB board of directors, \nand (iii) assessment of the amount required for capital adequacy of the CRB. Individual CRBs \nwill then finalize and adopt the plan and enter into a formal agreement with MOC (CRB \nRestructuring Committee) for implementation. Capitalization support will then be provided from \nthe CRB Fund. At the end of the first stage, a participating CRB will become a distinct financial \nentity  with  separate  statement  of  accounts  under  the  Cooperative  Societies  Act  of  1972. \nMeeting  the  performance  benchmarks  in  the  CRB  restructuring  plans  will  be  required  for \ncontinued RFSDP assistance. The second stage comprises implementation of the restructuring \nplan with support for institutional strengthening from the project loan (para. 79).  \n \n52.  Regional Development Bank Reforms. RFSDP will support reforms of RDBs where up \nto 80% of the CBSL stake has been divested and financial restructuring for ensuring capital \nadequacy  undertaken.  As  part  of  RFSDP,  the  CBSL  stake  has  been  transferred  to  the \nGovernment for initiating divestment through the Public Enterprise Reform Commission. MRE, \nin  consultation  with  CBSL,  has  prepared  draft  information  memorandums  for  divestment \nincluding diagnostic studies and portfolio audits. Subsequent to divestment, MRE in consultation \nwith CBSL and the concerned RDBs, will prepare RDB restructuring plans (phase one) covering \n(i) good governance, (ii) human resources, (iii) business processes, (iv) MIS, (v) auditing and \naccounting, and (vi) performance benchmarks. The plans will be implemented with support from \nthe project loan (para. 79).  \n \n53.  National Development Trust Fund Reforms. As part of RFSDP, NDTF has been \nincorporated as a company limited by guarantee for enhanced governance and operational \nflexibility, and for establishing a distinct borrower and lender relationship with participating RFIs. \nIn consultation with ADB, NDTF will develop and adopt an NDTF Corporate Plan covering \n(i) strategy, (ii) organization and human resources development, (iii) operational policies and \nguidelines  for  finance  activities,  (iv) policies  and  procedures  for  nonfinance  activities,  and \n(v) partnership arrangements with RFIs. The plan will include performance benchmarks and will \n  ", "15\nbe implemented with support from the project loan (para. 79). The aim is to transform NDTF into \nan effective microfinance apex agency for enhancing the capacity and outreach of MF-NGOs, \nespecially in conflict-affected areas.  \n \n54.  Samurdhi Banking Society Reforms.  As part of RFSDP, SBSs has completed a \ndiagnostic study and portfolio audit as a basis for determining institutional strengthening options \nin consultation with ADB. Based on the agreed option, the Ministry of Samurdhi will prepare an \nSBS  Institutional  Strengthening  Plan  covering  (i) governance,  (ii) organization  and  human \nresources,  (iii) operational  policies  and  guidelines,  (iv) MIS,  (v) accounting  and  auditing, \n(vi) business and viability projections, and (vii) implementation schedule. The objective of the \nplan is to ensure good governance and sustainability of SBSs, which is critical for a significant \npoverty  reduction  impact  with  a  gender  emphasis.  The  plan  will  include  performance \nbenchmarks and will be implemented with support from the project loan (para. 79).  \n \nd.  Strengthening the Demand Side  \n \n55.  RFIs mirror the conditions of the activities they finance, and the quality of their portfolios \ndepends on the condition of the enterprises to which they lend. In order to address the real \nsector issues for enhancing rural productivity, as part of RFSDP the Government has redrawn \nthe scope of the RERF for investments in skills development; marketing networks; infrastructure \nfor  enhancing  better  price  realization  of  rural  produce;  community  infrastructure  such  as \nstorage, small-scale irrigation; and farmer information centers (Appendix 10). RERF will support \nsuch activities mainly through community-led development initiatives in collaboration with NGOs \nand with full beneficiary participation, including cost sharing and control of investments.30 RERF \nactivities will be coordinated with ongoing and planned ADB-funded projects. Guidelines on \nsanction, usage, and monitoring of RERF formulated in consultation with ADB, NGOs, women\u2019s \ngroups, and RFIs have been adopted by MRE (Supplementary Appendix 4). The  location of \nRERF in MRE ensures coordination with RFIs, as MRE is also the nodal ministry for RFSDA \nand RDBs.  \n \n56.  The involvement of rural communities in identifying, planning, executing, and monitoring \nsubprojects will help expand the RF market and maintain peer pressure as a substitute for \nphysical collateral, which the poor do not possess. RERF will help realize the inherent synergy \nbetween the social and financial intermediation provided by specialized agencies. An added \nadvantage is the elimination of duplication of investments in social intermediation by a multitude \nof agencies, often done inefficiently. In the process, the RFIs, especially MF-NGOs, will be able \nto concentrate on acquiring much needed financial skills.31 \n \ne.  Expansion of Rural Finance in Conflict-Affected Areas  \n \n57.  As part of RFSDP, measures for the expansion of RF services in the conflict-affected \nareas (para. 32) will be continually assessed and identified in consultation with ADB to help \nensure a systematic institutionalized response including (i) supporting institutional strengthening \n                                                 \n30 ADB. 2000. Finance For the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. This identifies social intermediation \nas a core strategic element. ADB-funded PAK: Microfinance Sector Development Program created an arrangement \nsimilar to RERF for demand-side development that has led to positive externalities for the microfinance sector. \nADB-funded MON: Rural Finance Project also supports the establishment of Information Resource Centers for \nenhancing the capacity of rural borrowers through a participatory process involving NGOs and community \norganizations for effectively utilizing access to RF services.  \n31 To be provided under the Project Loan component for Building Sector Capacity (para. 77).  \n ", " 16 \n \nof new RFIs,32 (ii) prioritizing reform of CRBs in the region, (iii) activating and concentrating \nRERF interventions in the region, and (iv) ensuring coordination with other initiatives.33 The \nGovernment, as part of RFSDP, has allocated 10% each of the RERF and the rural enterprise \ndevelopment credit (para. 80) for the expansion of RF in the conflict-affected areas. In addition, \nRFSDP will provide institutional strengthening support to MF-NGOs and commercial banks that \nseek to expand their operations in the conflict-affected areas.  \n \n3.  Important Features  \n \n58.  RFSDP integrates the key elements of ADB\u2019s strategies for poverty reduction, the \nprivate sector, and microfinance development, as well as ADB\u2019s RF market analysis.34 RFSDP \nprovides  a  lead  role  for  ADB  in  RF,  which  is  critically  linked  to  a  range  of  rural  sector \ninterventions. Further,  RFSDP design directly contributes to the goals of the Government\u2019s \neconomic reform program (para. 3). \n \n59.  Linkages. RFSDP is anchored with the reforms in the banking sector and is consistent \nwith ADB-funded projects and sector development programs relating to small and medium \nenterprises, rural development, and plantation development (Appendix 7). RFSDP will also \nbenefit from ADB-funded infrastructure projects that will facilitate greater exchange of goods \nand services and linkages between rural and urban sectors. In addition, the ongoing structural \nadjustment process (para. 3) creates better conditions for a market-based RF sector.  \n \n60.  Realistic Agenda.  The scope of reforms and corresponding agencies are  based on \ncommitment to reforms and significance of impact. RFSDP has been developed by absorbing \nsuccessful international and local practices and RFSDP-supported reforms are sequenced for \ngenerating increasing acceptance among stakeholders during implementation. Besides potential \nsustainability, an important criterion for the selection of RFIs35 for reform is their presence in \nconflict-affected areas for enabling an effective response with the onset of peace. \n \n61.  Good  Governance.  RFSDP  emphasizes  a  comprehensive  range  of  restructuring \nmeasures, as incremental changes are insufficient for good governance. Accordingly, RFSDP \nfundamentally  alters  the  norms  for  governance  of  selected  RFIs,  particularly  the  CRBs. \nExtensive use of IT and MIS upgrading will facilitate transparency.  \n \n62.  Strengthening the Private Sector and Civil Society. RFSDP supports RFIs that either \nhave private sector interest or are in the process of increasing their private sector stake. CRBs \nand SBS are member-based entities, while CBSL\u2019s stake in RDBs is to be divested. In addition, \nthe RFSD Act provides legal status for MF-NGOs, which are mostly private, for mobilizing \nsavings. Assured funding from RERF for social intermediation through NGOs and community-\nbased organizations will contribute to gender equality.  \n                                                 \n32 Budgeted under the Project Loan (para.79).  \n33 ADB. 2003.

Study of Rural Asia, published by Oxford University Press.  \n35 SBS, CRBs, and NDTF (through participating RFIs) have presence in conflict-affected areas. The Government \nintends to revisit its plans to establish RDBs in conflict-affected areas when the security situation improves.  \n  ", "17\n4.  Financing Plan  \n \n63.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $50 million from its ordinary capital resources \n(OCR) for RFSDP, with a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, and an interest rate \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offer rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5%36 of the loan \namount; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the Program Loan Agreement. \n \n64.  The use of ADB funds is in support of policy reforms that address politically sensitive \nlong-standing issues and socially significant measures to enhance outreach to the rural sector. \nThe  fundamental  shift  in  the  RF  paradigm  is  reflected  in  (i) emphasis  on  depoliticization, \nautonomy, good governance, and sustainability; (ii) encouraging private sector participation in \nRF  for  enhancing  employment  and  income  generating  opportunities  for  the  poor;  and \n(iii) recognizing and supporting the role of MF-NGOs.  \n \n65.  The reforms ensure support for social sectors where continued and direct government \ninvolvement  is  warranted.  Phasing  out  misdirected  and  nontargeted  subsidies  through \ninstitutional reforms will enhance the fiscal space of the Government. This will enable release of \nfunds, among others, for social sectors as well as for relief and reconstruction in conflict-\naffected areas. RFSDP reforms also significantly reduce the risks to the savings of the poor \nhouseholds held with weak RFIs, thus enabling the Government to avoid the increased social \nand financial costs of delayed reforms. Most significantly, the enhanced access to a range of RF \nservices will enable rural households to take advantage of economic opportunities that new \ntechnology in manufacturing and agriculture provides. \n \n66.  The estimated direct cost of implementing RFSDP reforms at $70 million37 include: \n(i) operationalizing RFSDA ($10 million), comprising office and administrative costs ($5 million) \nand cost of due diligence of RFIs ($5 million);38 (ii) CRB reforms ($35 million), comprising \ncapitalization costs, at approximately SLRs5 million per CRB ($15 million)39 and erosion of value \nin  loans  and  investments  ($20 million);40  (iii) RDB  restructuring,  $5 million;41  (iv) RERF, \n$10 million;42 (v) NDTF reforms, $5 million; and (vi) SBS reforms, $5 million.43 RFSDP has been \ndesigned in view of the prevailing fiscal stress on the Government. Accordingly, the RFSDP \nprogram loan meets 70% of the estimated costs. With improving sustainability, the RFIs are \nexpected to generate surpluses, thus potentially obviating the need for further government \ninvestment in the RF sector.  \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \na.  Program Management  \n \n67.  The Ministry of Policy Development and Implementation (MPDI) will be the Executing \nAgency (EA) and will coordinate with CBSL, MOC, MRE, Ministry of Samurdhi, and Ministry of \n                                                 \n36 The 0.5% front-end fee is only for loans approved during 2003. \n37 These estimates exclude institutional strengthening costs covered by the project loan.  \n38 Starting in year 4, the licensing fee paid by RFIs will meet part of RFSDA expenses. \n39 CRBs in their existing form do not have equity.  \n40 This is at best conservative, as CRB loans to multipurpose cooperative societies are inadequately recorded and \nmany multipurpose cooperative societies are insolvent. Experience from commercial bank reforms indicate that the \nerosion in assets turns out to be more than estimates. \n41 The valuation of CBSL stake in RDBs is expected to be lower than the paid up amount.  \n42 This refers to social intermediation in coordination with RFIs.  \n43 The audits indicate unrealized losses in NDTF and SBS.  \n ", " 18 \n \nFinance on policy reforms. MPDI will establish a program management unit (PMU), headed by a \nprogram director, who will be the Additional Secretary of MPDI, for monitoring implementation. \nThe program director will be assisted by two directors and four full-time staff, recruited with \nRFSDP support, with qualifications and experience acceptable to ADB. MRE (for RERF, RDBs, \nand RFSDA), MOC (for CRBs), NDTF (for NDTF), and the Ministry of Samurdhi (for SBSs) will \nbe implementing agencies (IAs) and will set up program implementation units (PIUs). Each PIU \nwill have a program director supported by one specialist staff with qualifications and experience \nacceptable  to  ADB.  MPDI  will  constitute  a  program  steering  committee,  for  interagency \ncoordination, comprising the heads of the PIUs and a representative each from the Ministry of \nFinance and MPDI. The steering committee will select a chairperson from amongst its members \nand meet every quarter. A program organization chart is in Appendix 11. \n \nb.  Period of Implementation \n68.  The 4-year implementation period will be completed by December 2007 (Appendix 12).  \n \nc.  Procurement and Disbursement \n \n69.  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange costs of items produced \nand  procured  in  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  (Appendix 13).  The \nGovernment will certify that (i) if the loan proceeds will finance goods already imported, the \nvalue of eligible imports in the period concerned will exceed the amount of the requested \nwithdrawal or (ii) if the loan proceeds will finance items to be imported, the value of eligible \nimports in the immediately preceding 1-year period will be equal to or greater than the amount \nof the requested withdrawal plus all other amounts expected to be withdrawn during the period.  \n \nd.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n70.  An audit of the use of the loan proceeds will be undertaken if requested by ADB and \nADB retains the right to (i) audit any account and (ii) verify the validity of the certification issued \nby the Government for each withdrawal application. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will \nopen a deposit account at CBSL to receive all loan proceeds. The account will be established, \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. The PMU will \nsend quarterly progress reports to ADB on policy and institutional reforms. \n \ne.     Counterpart Funds  \n \n71.  As part of RFSDP, the Government will contribute the counterpart funds for RFSDA \n($10 million), CRB ($10 million), and RERF ($10 million) from the first and second tranches \n(para. 72). Balance counterpart funds from first and second tranches as well as counterpart \nfunds  from  subsequent  tranches  will  be  allocated  in  consultation  with  ADB.  Precise  and \nmonitorable dedication of counterpart funds through explicit commitments directly supports \nRFSDP reforms and contributes to the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s poverty reduction goals. \n \nf.  Tranching and Monitoring \n \n72.  The program loan will be released over a 4-year period after loan effectiveness in four \ntranches to meet the expected occurrence of associated costs. The first tranche of $15 million \nwill be released on loan effectiveness, the second tranche of $20 million within 12 months of the \nfirst tranche, the third tranche of $10 million within 18 months of the second tranche, and the \n  ", "19\nfourth tranche of $5 million within 18 months of the third tranche, subject to compliance with the \nconditions for their release. \n \n73.  Monitorable and time-bound actions are reflected in the policy matrix attached to the \ndevelopment policy letter (Appendix 8). Both the Government and ADB will regularly and closely \nmonitor RFSDP implementation. Special audits and reviews will be conducted periodically.  \n \ng.  Program Performance Management System \n \n74.  The PMU will establish and maintain a program performance management system that \nwill include a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the \npolicy matrix. This will be linked with the project performance management system (para. 99).  \n \nh.  Program Review \n \n75.  The Government and ADB will conduct a comprehensive midterm review at the end of \nyear 2 to evaluate the progress of the reform measures and their impact on the RF sector. In \naddition, ADB will also monitor implementation through periodic reviews and progress reports. \nADB will conduct annual reviews throughout the implementation period. These will help in \nidentifying further actions for the continued development of the RF markets. \n \nC.  The Project Loans  \n1.  Objectives  \n \n76.  The project loans\u2019 objective is to strengthen key sector institutions for providing training \nin RF, efficient service delivery, sector supervision, and outreach expansion. Strengthening key \nsector institutions will increase the access of rural households to RF services.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \n77.  Building Sector Capacity. RFSDP will support the CBS as a center for excellence in \nRF. CBS capacity  (para. 18) will  be  enhanced  to  (i) create awareness of the possibilities, \nprospects, and risks in RF; (ii) improve governance of RF operations; (iii) undertake demand \nassessment for developing products and services in line with nature of demand with due \nrecognition  of  gender  dimensions;  (iv) institute  enhanced  portfolio  management capability; \n(v) design systems and procedures for reducing the cost of delivery of RF services; (vi) enhance \nenvironmental  awareness  and  social  safeguard  screening  steps  in  credit  appraisal; \n(vii) disseminate RF best practices; and (viii) strengthen linkages between commercial banks, \nRFIs,  and  MF-NGOs. Using its facilities, CBS will provide extensive training for RFI staff \nincluding training for trainers. Support, through CBS, will be provided to the Rural Development \nTraining Institute to enhance the effectiveness of social intermediation with an emphasis on \ngender  aspects  that  could  be  mainstreamed  through  RERF  interventions.  RFSDP  will \ncoordinate with funding agencies that have RF interventions.44 RFSDP will support capacity \nbuilding of commercial banks, through the CBS, to upgrade their RF operations as well as \nstrengthen their RF operations in conflict-affected areas. All materials and reports developed \nwith RFSDP support will be placed on the CBS web site. After the midterm review, RFSDP will \n(i) support the consolidation of the outputs into a distance learning diploma course through the \n                                                 \n44  Work undertaken by GTZ of Germany with the People\u2019s Bank will be considered for replication.  \n ", " 20 \n \nOpen University45 and (ii) consider the transfer of the facilities and skills developed at CBS with \nRFSDP support to the proposed new RF training center that CBSL is envisaging. \n \n78.  Developing  Financial  Infrastructure.  Institutional  development  support  for  RFSDA \n(paras. 46\u201349) will include (i) organizational design; (ii) operating procedures including off-site \nand on-site supervision; (iii) prudential standards for RFIs including reporting, audit, accounting, \nand MIS; and (iv) MIS and IT design and equipment for RFSDA. Assistance will also cover \ntraining and skills development of RFSDA staff. In addition, RFSDP will, through RFSDA or any \nappropriate agency, support private sector audit and credit-rating firms for developing their RFI \nappraisal skills with emphasis on governance, accounts, and MIS.  \n \n79.  Rural Finance Institution Restructuring. Following  the  adoption  of  policy  reforms \n(paras. 50\u201354), the second stage of institutional reforms will constitute the implementation of the \nCRB Restructuring Plan, RDB Restructuring Plan, NDTF Corporate Plan, and SBS Institutional \nStrengthening Plan. The scope will cover governance, organization, human resources, business \nprocesses,  and  products  and  services.  The  reorienting,  redesigning,  and  repackaging  of \nproducts and services as well as of systems and procedures will be undertaken to ensure \nminimal transaction cost. IT and MIS architecture will be upgraded in line with international best \npractices in business processes. In addition, institutional strengthening of those MF-NGOs that \nmeet the RFSDA licensing criteria will be available through NDTF, especially for expanding their \noperations in the conflict-affected areas.  \n  \n80.  Rural Enterprise Development. RFSDP will provide onlending support to RFIs that \nmeet predetermined eligibility criteria. The onlending support ($10 million equivalent) will be only \nfor  subloans  not  exceeding  SLRs100,000  targeted  at  micro  enterprises  and  small  rural \nenterprises. To start with, 10% of the credit line will be for conflict-affected areas. Three fourths \nof the credit line by amount will be for women entrepreneurs (paras. 8 and 11). As regards \nmitigating demand and supply gaps for rural credit for larger loans (para. 31), RFSDP, through \nprioritizing institutional reforms, provides the basis for RFIs to enhance outreach by mobilizing \nas well as prudently deploying client savings. This approach will provide much greater prospects \nfor sustained outreach than a finite credit line.  \n81.  Project Implementation Support. RFSDP will support the establishment and capacity \nbuilding of the PMU and PIUs for the following: (i) MPDI for overall coordination; (ii) MRE for \nRERF and RFSDA implementation, and RDB reform coordination; (iii) MOC for coordinating \nCRB reforms and effective use of the CRB Fund; and (iv) NDTF and SBS for effective project \nimplementation. RFSDP will provide partial operating support cost to the EA and IAs.  \n \n  3.  Important Features  \n \n82.  Sector  capacity  building  and  application  of  IT  provides  the  basis  for  upgrading, \nmanaging, and sustaining RF sector improvements. Capacity building will enhance the ability of \nRFIs to develop new client-centered products and the credit line will facilitate immediate delivery \nof credit products including in resource poor and conflict-affected areas. Further, institutional \nstrengthening is expected to produce a stream of benefits that includes efficiency and greater \noutreach within a transparent supervisory environment. Commercially viable orientation of RFIs \nwill facilitate their linkages with the financial sector. \n \n                                                 \n45 The Open University is the IA for Loan No. 1999-SRI (SF): Distance Education Modernizing Project, for $45 million.  \n  ", "21\n83.  Women who own very few assets and little land will especially benefit, as they are often \ndisadvantaged due to collateral constraints. In addition to the allocation of 75% of the rural \nenterprise development credit, RFSDP design mainstreams gender concerns through (i) gender \nawareness training to promote gender balanced client outreach and (ii) encouraging RFIs to \nformulate business plans, which include quantifiable targets for gender outreach, especially in \nconflict-affected areas. Further, the community investment planning process under RERF will \ninclude needs assessment of female community members.  \n   \n4.  Financing Plan  \n \n84.  The estimated cost of $27.79 million equivalent (Table 1), comprises $3.64 million (13%) \nin foreign exchange and $24.15 million equivalent (87%) in local currency costs (Appendix 14, \nand Supplementary Appendix 5).

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $10 million from its OCR for the rural enterprise \ndevelopment credit. The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The \nOCR loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate to \nbe determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5% of the loan amount; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the Project Loan Agreement.  \n \n86.  A loan of $10 million equivalent  from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will support \nbuilding  sector  capacity,  RFI  restructuring,  developing  financial  infrastructure,  and  project \nimplementation. The Borrower will be the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka. The loan \nwill have 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years; and with an interest rate charge of \n1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms \nand conditions as set forth in the Project Loan Agreement. \n ", " 22 \n \n87.  The provision of local currency costs is considered warranted for ensuring that sufficient \nand timely funding is available for outreach expansion and institutional strengthening, thereby \nminimizing the risk of implementation delay. Country considerations justify higher local currency \nfinancing, especially when the Government has shown willingness to borrow OCR funds for a \ncore poverty intervention. The Government has made concerted efforts to maintain domestic \ninvestment levels to sustain growth, but the country faces persistent budget pressures, arising \nfrom, among others, the civil conflict. Moreover, the program loan only partially meets the cost \nof implementing the reforms (para. 66).  \n \nTable 2: Project Loan Financing Plan ($ million) \n \n   Source     Foreign         Local      Total        % \n Exchange      Currency          Cost   \n         \nAsian Development Bank        3.64          16.36          20.00      72 \nRural Finance Institutions        0.00            3.00            3.00      11 \nSubborrowers        0.00            3.00            3.00      11 \nGovernment        0.00             1.79            1.79        6 \n         \nTotal         3.64          24.15           27.79     100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n  5.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n a.  Project Management  \n \n88.  As the EA, MPDI will coordinate project implementation support. CBSL will be the IA for \nbuilding sector capacity. Other IAs will deal with their respective institutions (para. 67). PIUs will \nsubmit information and analysis to the PMU and coordinate the fielding and work of consultants. \nThe PMU will ensure submission of periodic reports. Sound accounting and internal control \nsystems will be adopted by the PMU.  \n \n89.  Flow of Funds. The following terms and conditions will apply for disbursements: \n \n(i)  Building sector capacity: grant from the Government to CBSL. \n \n(ii)  Developing financial infrastructure: grant from the Government to RFSDA. \n \n(iii)  RFI restructuring: grants for RFIs except for RDBs. For the divested RDBs, \nsupport will be available as soft loans through NDTF under terms and conditions \nlaid down in a separate subsidiary loan agreement satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n(iv)  Rural enterprise development: Ministry of Finance  will relend to NDTF at \naverage weighted deposit rates under the terms and conditions laid down in a \nseparate  subsidiary  loan  agreement  satisfactory  to  ADB  (Supplementary \nAppendix 6). A service charge will be admissible to NDTF. \n \n(v)  Project implementation support: grant from the Government to EAs and IAs. \n \n90.  Management of Cooperative Rural Bank Fund and Rural Economy Resuscitation \nFund. Each fund is governed by specific rules, to ensure that the specified objectives are \n  ", "23\nachieved. Independent auditors will annually audit both funds and their usage and the reports \nwill be made public.  \n \n(i)  The CRB Restructuring Committee at MOC will manage the CRB Fund.  CRB \nFund  Rules  (Supplementary  Appendix 3)  include  (i) fund  description  and \ndefinitions,  (ii) objectives  and  purposes,  (iii) contributions  and  investments, \ngovernance and administration, (iv) annual reports and audits, and (v) eligible \ninstitutions. To be eligible, CRBs will adopt and abide by the restructuring plan \nperformance benchmarks. Capitalization support from the CRB Fund will be long-\nterm loans at a cost to be determined by MOC. These loans will be converted to \nsubordinated  debt  (Tier  II  capital)  after  3  years  at  mutually  agreed  terms, \nincluding dividends, provided that the CRBs demonstrate positive performance.  \n \n(ii)  RERF will be invested in long-term treasury bills and the revenue generated will \nbe transferred quarterly to a designated bank account of MRE for ensuring a \nrealistic disbursement schedule.46 An RERF Secretariat, established in terms of \nthe  Guidelines  for  RERF  Investment  and  Operations  (Supplementary \nAppendix 4), will undertake administration of the RERF, select service providers, \nenter  into  partnership  agreements,  appraise  proposals,  and  make  payments \nbased  on  invoices  to  the  account  of  service  providers  after  documentary \nevidence. While RERF investments will be grants for rural poor communities, \nRERF may seek capital repayments in the event that any investment generates a \ncash flow. All such cash inflows, however, will have to be reinvested in RERF.  \n \nb.  Period of Implementation  \n \n91.  The 4-year implementation period will be completed by December 2007 (Appendix 12).  \n \nc.  Procurement  \n \n92.  Procurement of goods and services will be subject to the provisions of ADB's Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Vehicles  and  office  equipment  will  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding procedures for packages exceeding $500,000 equivalent, and  through \ninternational shopping procedures for packages between $100,000 and $500,000 equivalent. \nFor packages below $100,000 equivalent direct purchase may be used. Indicative contract \npackages and mode of procurement are in Appendix 15.  \n \nd.  Consulting Services \n \n93.  A  total  of  58  person-months  of  international  and  628  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services will be financed by the project loan from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Supplementary  Appendix 7).  Consulting  services  will  support  building  sector  capacity  (82 \nperson-months); RFI restructuring (307 person-months); developing financial infrastructure (120 \nperson-months);  and  project  implementation  support  (177  person-months).  The  consulting \ninputs reflect the need to ensure that adequate technical skills are continuously available \nthroughout RFSDP in view of sector capacity constraints, the range of RFIs being reformed, and \nthe strengthening of the PMU and PIUs. Consulting inputs mitigate the risk of frequent changes \n                                                 \n46 This mechanism provides a long-term assured source of funding and ensures adequate controls for selection of \nsubprojects that provide greater social and economic returns. An assured funding source will encourage NGO \nservice providers to specialize and work toward improving their efficiency in social service delivery. \n ", " 24 \n \n(para. 115) of personnel associated with RFSDP implementation. They also ensure appropriate \ntechnical inputs that would otherwise not be possible in view of the budget constraints facing the \nEA  and  IAs.  The  consultants  will  be  placed  in  the  IAs,  and  within  the  IAs  to  respective \nspecialized agencies, such as for RFSDA and RERF within MRE. \n \n94.  All consultants to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loans will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  arrangements  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants satisfactory to ADB. Where firms are to be engaged, the \nquality and cost-based selection method and simplified procedures will be used for consultant \nselection. Consultants will be recruited by MPDI on behalf of all IAs. To facilitate consultant \nrecruitment, position-based terms of reference and indicative consulting packages are provided \nin Supplementary Appendix 7. \n \ne.  Disbursement Arrangements  \n \n95.  MPDI,  on  behalf  of  the  Government,  will  open  at  CBSL,  within  1  month  of  loan \neffectiveness, an imprest account denominated in US dollars. The imprest account will be \nestablished, managed, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Handbook on \nLoan Disbursements  dated  January  2001  and ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement \nOperations\u2014LIBOR-Based Loan Products  dated July 2002. ADB will advance 6 months of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the total whichever is lower into the imprest account for each \nof the OCR and Special Funds resource loans. Foreign exchange payments or letters of credit, \nas well as local currency expenditures, may be paid out of the imprest account. The ADB \nstatement of expenditure procedure will be used to liquidate and replenish the imprest account \nfor individual payments not exceeding $50,000. \n \n96.  The EA and IAs will maintain separate records and accounts, adequate to identify goods \nand services financed out of the loan proceeds and to disclose the use of such goods and \nservices following sound accounting principles. Auditors acceptable to  ADB will audit such \nrecords and accounts annually. Within 9 months of the close of the financial year, certified \ncopies of the audit report together with the auditor\u2019s opinion will be submitted to the Government \nand ADB. The audit reports will include a separate opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand statement of expenditure procedures.  \n \nf.  Accounts, Audits, and Reports  \n \n97.  The PMU will submit reports to ADB concerning the use of loan proceeds, project \nadministration, and financial management. The reports will include (i) quarterly and annual \nproject implementation reports, (ii) a midterm review report, and (iii) a project completion report \nto be submitted not later than 6 months after project completion. The reports, consolidating \ninputs from IAs, will cover (i) expenditures, (ii) activities financed, (iii) highlights of audit reports, \n(iv) training  activities  and  their  impact,  (v) institutional  strengthening,  (vi) rural  enterprise \ndevelopment, and (vii) progress on RF expansion in conflict-affected areas. These aspects will \nbe discussed in greater detail in the annual reports.  \n \n98.  The Government will maintain separate records and accounts for the imprest account \nand project expenditure in accordance with sound accounting principles and will have such \naccounts and records audited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB.  The Government will \nensure that the submission of project reports, audited accounts, and financial statements is in \ncompliance with ADB's guidelines. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB, will audit RFSDA, \nRERF, participating RDBs, and consolidated accounts for NDTF and SBS. The audit reports will \n  ", "25\nbe submitted to ADB within 9 months of the reporting period. MOC will provide the key findings \nof CRB reforms and summarize audit findings of participating CRBs. The auditors will also carry \nout inspection of physical activities.  \n  \ng.  Project Performance Management System \n \n99.  MPDI, drawing on data from IAs, will establish and maintain a project performance \nmanagement system that will generate semiannual and annual reports. The information system \nwill comprise (i) financial and efficiency indicators of RFIs;47 (ii) number of borrowers by gender \nand  poverty  classification,  type  of  services,  and  the  size  of  transactions;  and  (iii) social \nintermediation  outreach.  The  IAs  will  periodically  monitor  the  socioeconomic  indicators  of \nborrowers such as income, asset holding, and employment status to measure poverty outreach \nand poverty reduction impacts of RFSDP. RFI restructuring and institutional strengthening will \nprovide financial benchmarks  \n \nh.  Project Reviews  \n \n100.  ADB and the Government will periodically review project implementation. The reviews \nwill include evaluation of the project scope, implementation arrangements, consultation with IAs \nand participating RFIs, implementation of RFI restructuring, progress with the policy reform \nagenda, and capacity-building measures. ADB will also field regular review missions, including a \nmidterm review mission, and project completion review missions. A comprehensive midterm \nreview at the end of year 2 will be undertaken to evaluate actual physical and financial progress. \nBased on this review, modifications and improvements will be considered. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts  \n \n1.  Policy \n \n101.  RFSDP represents a shift toward a financial system development approach where \nsustainable RFIs, over a time, are expected to attain greater outreach, including to the poor, and \nproduct diversity, resulting in more clients served and their diverse needs met. Sustainability will \ndiminish  political  interference  by  reducing  the  dependence  on  government  resources  and \nsubsidies,  which  in  turn  will  enable  the  Government  to  increase  development  investment. \nIncreased access to RF services will facilitate growth and diversification of private sector rural \nenterprises,  for  both  farm  and  nonfarm  sectors,  which  will  generate  local  employment \nopportunities and contribute to poverty reduction.  Policy, legal, regulatory, and institutional \nreforms are anchored on good governance, transparency, and rigorous financial discipline. \nRFSDP supported reforms will strengthen the sector through the following: \n \n(i)  RFIs can better respond to growth opportunities when they operate in a conducive \npolicy environment and are appropriately governed. RFSDP provides the framework \nand incentives for sustainable RF markets to develop.  \n \n                                                 \n47 RFI  restructuring  and  institutional  strengthening  plans  will  provide  financial  benchmarks.  The  model  CRB \nRestructuring Plan includes key performance benchmarks to serve as monitoring indicators. Similar performance \nbenchmarks will be developed for effective monitoring in consultation with other RFIs.  \n ", " 26 \n \n(ii)  RFSDP encourages private sector entry in RF by demonstrating the profit potential of \nthe RF sector. The Government\u2019s gradual exit as an RF provider will enable competition \nto emerge, which will improve quality and efficiency.  \n \n(iii)  The development of a supervisory and regulatory framework will contribute to financial \nsoundness, good governance, transparency, and encourage integration of the hitherto \nsegmented RF markets with the mainstream financial sector.  \n \n(iv)  Checks on the proliferation of unsustainable and ineffectively supervised RFIs will \nreduce regulatory arbitrage and forbearance, and enhance the security of rural savings. \n \n(v)  RFSDP will eventually force all RFIs to reform or risk being marginalized. The need for \nbudgetary support to unviable RFIs will diminish when the reformed RFIs are able to \nsustainably fill outreach gaps.  \n \n(vi)  Sector analysis undertaken in consultation with ADB will make certain that the needs of \nthe  conflict-affected  areas  are  being  appropriately  addressed.  This  will  strengthen \nADB\u2019s lead role in RF sector development. \n \n2.  Institutional \n \n102.  RFSDA will provide cost-effective supervision appropriate for small RFIs that need \nflexibility  and  improvisations.  While  ensuring  prudent  lending  and  investment  decisions,48 \nRFSDA will also facilitate coordination of RF policies to maximize the impact of rural sector \ninvestments. In the process, commercial banks will overcome their apprehension of increasing \ntheir RF portfolio. Prior RFI commitment to reforms will facilitate and expedite the institutional \ntransformation. The resulting efficiency and cost savings will enable early recovery of RFI \nrestructuring costs. The RFIs can turn themselves around within 3\u20135 years with recapitalization \nand reduction in NPLs, cost reductions due to rationalization of systems and procedures, and \nMIS and IT upgrading. In addition, improved repayment rates due to depoliticization of debt \nrecovery will improve portfolio quality.  \n \n3.   Economic and Financial  \n \n103.  Outreach  expansion  will  have  a  significant  employment  generation  and  income \nenhancement impact. Direct employment will be generated by the high labor content of the \nsmall  rural  and  micro  enterprise  subprojects,  whether  financed  by  the  rural  enterprise \ndevelopment credit (para. 80) or by own funds of RFIs. The estimated 10,000 micro enterprises \nto be financed by the rural enterprise development credit are expected to generate about 10,000 \nfull-time jobs, primarily for rural women. In addition, the RERF could support 850 subprojects \neach requiring some 200 person-days equivalent of community labor with significant social \ndevelopment content, especially gender empowerment. Such benefits include improved rural \nhousehold incomes that will result from an increase in the cropping intensity and cultivated area \nwith better irrigation, regular availability of inputs, application of improved technology, lower \ntransaction and financial costs, and timely access to markets. Resource flows in conflict-\naffected areas will be assured through specific allocations under RERF and the rural enterprise \ndevelopment credit line.  \n \n                                                 \n48  The  RFSD  Act  restricts  investments  to  only  government-approved  investments,  sets  capital-adequacy \nrequirements for obtaining and maintaining a license, and requires RFIs to create provisions for deposit protection.  \n  ", "27\n104.  Enhanced financial and institutional capacity  of RFIs with RFSDP support will enable \nRFIs  to  deploy  their  funds  (savings  and  borrowings)  in  credit,  thus  reversing  the  flow  of \nresources from rural areas. Conservatively, a one percentage point increase in the credit-to-\ndeposit ratio translates into nearly 20,000 new borrowers at the average micro loan size of \nSLRs20,500. It is expected that the aggregate credit-to-deposit ratio of RFIs will increase by \n10 percentage points, translating into 200,000 additional borrowers during RFSDP duration. \nMore significantly, RFI reforms and deposit protection measures through the RFSD Act will \nsignificantly enhance the security of the savings of rural households. Considering that there are \nabout 7 million savings accounts with RFIs, their protection and proper deployment in rural \nareas constitutes the most significant benefit of RFSDP.  \n \n4.  Environmental \n \n105.  A summary initial environmental examination of farm and nonfarm activities was made \nand  the  results  were  grouped  into  two  broad  classes,  representing  loans  for  small  rural \nenterprises  and  for  micro  enterprises  to  determine  their  impact  on  the  environment.  As \nconcluded in the initial environmental examination, none of the representative farm and nonfarm \nenterprises is likely to result in a significant environmental impact. There are no negative \nenvironmental impacts that cannot be mitigated. Subborrowers will be required to follow relevant \nenvironmental standards and regulations. As part of building sector capacity, CBS will enhance \nthe environmental management system (para. 77) of the participating RFIs. The summary initial \nenvironment examination is in Supplementary Appendix 8.  \n \n5.  Social and Poverty  \n \n106.  Reducing poverty is best served by reducing the incidence and impact of the causes of \npoverty for the largest number of people. To achieve this, in line with the Government\u2019s \nprogram,49 RFSDP aims to support pro-poor RFIs; capacity building of RFIs and their clients; \naccess of the poor to social services and infrastructure through RERF; rural livelihoods; and \ninvestments in conflict-affected areas. With the participation of major RFIs, the poverty reduction \nimpact  of  RFSDP  reforms  will  be  widespread.  Enhanced  legal  provisions  for  improved \ngovernance and sustainability of RFIs increase the prospects to expand RF outreach to meet \nthe growing demand and supply gaps even beyond the life of RFSDP. Increased supply of RF \nwill help rural households intensify and expand their operations through application of improved \ntechnology. Linkages within the rural economy and between the rural and urban economies will \nalso be stimulated through increased financial intermediation. \n \n107.  Increased and preferential support for rural women entrepreneurs  explicitly supports \ngender equity. In addition, RERF will ensure that rural women have access to supporting \nmechanisms for access to skills, technology, and markets (paras. 55-56) along with credit. \nCommunity-based projects will also be developed with poor women as a target group. Specific \nallocations for conflict-affected areas for RERF and rural enterprise development credit will \nsupport programs, such as access to basic services and livelihood opportunities for women \naffected  by  armed  conflict,  including  war  widows.  For  ensuring  these,  gender  awareness \ntraining and collation of gender-disaggregated data have been integrated into RFSDP design.  \n \n108.  RFSDP will not have any adverse impact on indigenous peoples and, thus, will not \ntrigger ADB\u2019s  Policy on Indigenous Peoples  and  the  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement. \n                                                 \n49 Government of Sri Lanka. 2002. Regaining Sri Lanka. Colombo. \n ", " 28 \n \nHowever, a social-safeguard screening step has been added to ensure that there will be no \nadverse impacts. A Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy is in Appendix 16. \n \nB.   Risks   \n109.  The RFSDP design is based on lessons learned from successful practices. Success and \nimpact will, though, depend on a number of assumptions that are subject to varying degrees of \nrisk. Mitigating measures have been put in place as appropriate and possible.  \n \n1.  Program Loan  \n \n110.  Commitment to Reform. The lack of sustained government commitment to a market-\ndriven RF sector is a major risk. The Government has already committed to reform measures \nrelating to good governance, effective supervision, and sustainability. It is also expected that \nimproved economic performance as a result of the ongoing structural reforms will reduce the \npressure on the Government to intervene in the RF markets, especially for lowering lending \ninterest rates. The  Government\u2019s commitment to commercial bank reforms, despite strong \nopposition from staff unions, suggests that RF reforms will also be similarly pursued. \n \n111.  Delay  in  Policy  Reforms.  Effective  policy  dialogue,  stakeholder  coordination,  and \ncapacity-building support are safeguards for smooth implementation of policy reforms. Public \nawareness to convey the real benefits of the reforms will further mitigate the possible risks of \ndelay  in  policy  reforms.  For  expediting  reforms,  RFSDP  supports  recapitalization  and \ninstitutional strengthening, including technological upgrading for the reforming RFIs.  \n \n112.  Coverage of Conflict-affected Areas.  The realization of RFSDP objectives depends \nupon the ability of RFIs to operate effectively in the conflict-affected areas. Some enterprising \nMF-NGOs, CRBs, SBSs, and commercial banks have already started small RF operations in \nthese areas. RFSDP will encourage and facilitate this process, and simultaneously invest in \ninstitutional strengthening for rapid expansion as the situation improves.  \n \n2.  Project Loans  \n \n113.  Institutional Reforms. Decades of politicization have created norms and values in RFIs \nthat are not easily amenable to change. Such norms could affect restructuring, erode autonomy, \nand prevent the expected improvements in repayments from materializing. Factors that diminish \nthe risks include financial support for restructuring and upfront agreement on governance \nframework and autonomy. RFSDP support is contingent on performance. Restructuring plans \nwith  performance  benchmarks  will  be  introduced  to  track  institutional  performance.  RFIs \nappreciate that better performance will enable them to expand their operations and provide a \ngreater range of services.50 \n \n114.  High Delinquency. RFIs are most vulnerable to increases in loan losses and reductions \nin loan revenues. The following constitute an effective safeguard against delinquency: (i) stricter \napplication of legal measures for minimizing willful defaults; (ii) tightening of credit standards, \nmore attention to credit risk, and rigorous credit appraisal through application of IT for improving \nportfolio quality; (iii) significant investment in capacity building for adoption of successful RF \npractices; and (iv) in the case of microfinance, peer pressure, to ensure repayments. In addition, \ngovernment commitment not to interfere in lending and loan collections will improve repayment \n                                                 \n50 The RFSD Act links the scale and range of operations to financial performance.  \n  ", "29\nrates. RFIs will also be adequately capitalized to meet transient risks. Tighter prudential norms \ncould drive up costs in the short term and could even require higher provisioning. However, in \nthe medium to long run these will strengthen viability.  \n \n115.  Implementation  Delays.  Capacity  constraints  and  frequent  changes  in  personnel \n(para. 93) at the EA and the IAs might delay implementation. Project implementation support \nand  close  performance  monitoring  will  help  reduce  the  adverse  affects  of  this.  Adequate \ntechnical assistance and capacity-building support have also been provided. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n116.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n  Program Loan \n \n(i)  The Government will ensure: (a) that the objectives achieved, policies adopted \nand actions taken as set forth in the policy letter and the policy matrix will \ncontinue to be in full force and effect for the duration of the RFSDP period and \nsubsequently; and (b) proper and timely achievement, adoption, compliance, and \nimplementation of the objectives, policies and actions to be achieved, adopted, \ncomplied with, and implemented as set forth in the policy letter and the policy \nmatrix  and  will  ensure  that  once  achieved,  adopted,  complied  with  and \nimplemented, such objectives, policies and actions will continue to be in full force \nand effect during and subsequent to the RFSDP period.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will support RFSDA in the licensing, supervision, and regulation \nof the RFIs and will ensure that adequate funds are provided to  RFSDA in a \ntimely and efficient manner to ensure its successful functioning. \n \n(iii)  The Government will promptly inform ADB of any changes in the board of \ndirectors  or  senior  management  of  RFSDA  and  will  ensure  that  any  such \nchanges will be made in accordance with the provisions of the RFSD Act.  \n \n(iv)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  RERF  and  CRB  Fund  operations  are \nconducted, to the satisfaction of ADB, in an efficient and transparent manner. \nAny amendment to the RERF trust deed and/or CRB Fund rules shall be subject \nto ADB\u2019s prior approval. The Government shall promptly inform ADB of any \nchanges in the management of RERF and/or CRB Fund. \n \n(v)  The Government will acquire and instill forensic accounting capability to ensure \ntracking and minimizing corruption in RFSDP implementation. \n \n(vi)  The Government will carry out RFSDP in accordance with its environmental laws \nand regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. \n \nProject Loans  \n \n(i)  In case of natural calamities and unforeseen circumstances that affect the equity \nand liquidity of RFIs, ADB will be consulted immediately and a remedial action \n ", " 30 \n \nplan  acceptable  to  ADB  will  be  prepared  within  1  month  thereafter,  and \nsubsequently implemented to the satisfaction of ADB.  \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that no persons will be negatively affected in terms \nof ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeople.  \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that lending operations of RFIs availing project \nsupport  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  all  environmental  laws  and \nregulations of the Government and with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy.  \n \n(iv)  The Government will allocate and make available in a timely manner sufficient \nfunds for the implementation of the Project.  \n \nVI.

The rural finance (RF)1 sector in Sri Lanka has a history of ad hoc public sector \ninterventions, resulting in a proliferation of financially and institutionally weak RF institutions \n(RFIs). Many RFIs have been created by funding agencies, ministries, and departments to \nchannel  rural  credit  under  numerous  government-sponsored  programs  to  special  interest \ngroups.  Practices  that  sharply  deviate  from  prudent  financial  intermediation,  including \nsubsidized interest rates, politicization of benefits, and debt cancellation, have resulted in weak \ncredit discipline and crowding out of the private sector. \n \n2.  Rural Economy. Sri Lanka\u2019s population was 18.7 million in 2001. Its per capita gross \ndomestic product of $870 is the highest in South Asia. Sri Lanka has had relatively healthy \neconomic growth, with an average growth rate of nearly 5% per annum during the last two \ndecades. In terms of human development indicators, Sri Lanka has achieved a level consistent \nwith those of high-income countries. However, economic growth has been skewed in favor of \nthe urban sector. Concentration of industry close to the main ports has led to an uneven \nregional distribution of the benefits of economic growth. Poverty continues to be widespread, \nwith estimates ranging from 25% to 39% of the population.2 \n \n3.  Sri Lanka is primarily a rural economy with almost 80% of the population living in rural \nareas. Poverty is predominantly a rural  phenomenon with rural poverty incidence in some \nregions being as high as 50%. Rural economy is adversely affected by stagnant agriculture \ngrowth, poorly targeted agriculture subsidies, and a weak land tenure and registration system. \nAs  in  the  rest  of  the  region,  production  and  marketing  bottlenecks  due  to  weak  rural \ninfrastructure and the resulting low profitability and productivity make it difficult for the rural \nsector in Sri Lanka to compete for investment capital. On the other hand, policies relating to \nagriculture repress farm income potential. Absence of forward and backward linkages to support \nvalue addition to rural produce impedes diversification of income sources. \n \n4.  As  a  result,  predominantly  agricultural  areas  such  as  the  North-Western  and  Uva \nprovinces remain less developed, and the Southern province is the poorest in terms of per \ncapita income and has the highest unemployment rate, outside the conflict-affected areas. Rural \nlabor cannot be absorbed by the nonfarm  sector due to difficulties in promoting viable rural \nenterprises including micro enterprises in an environment of sluggish macroeconomic growth, \nsegmented markets, and infrastructure bottlenecks. The rural economy is largely subsistence \nbased, offering very few opportunities for upward mobility. Low skill levels among the rural poor \nalso inhibit their participation in the local economy. \n \n5.  RF Structure. The RF sector in Sri Lanka consists of (i) the formal sector:3 state-owned \nand private commercial banks, National Savings Bank (NSB), regional development banks \n(RDBs) and SANASA Development Bank (SDB); (ii) the semiformal sector: cooperative rural \nbanks (CRBs), thrift and credit cooperative societies (TCCSs), Samurdhi Banking  Societies \n(SBSs), National Development Trust Fund (NDTF), about 200 microfinance-nongovernment \n                                                 \n1  In this appendix, the term \u2018RF\u2019 or \u2018RFI\u2019 (RF institution) is inclusive of \u2018MF\u2019 (microfinance) or \u2018MFI\u2019 (MF institution)\u2019, \nrespectively. The term \u2019MF\u2019 or \u2018MFI\u2019 is used only for specific MF related reference. \n2  Depending on the underlying poverty line. The official consumption-based poverty line for the chronically poor is \nSLRs860 per adult per month, excluding the north and the east (Government of Sri Lanka. 2002. Framework for \nPoverty Reduction. Colombo.). \n3  Formal sector RFIs include those supervised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) and semiformal RFIs are \nthose established or registered under secondary rules of various laws but not supervised by CBSL. \n ", " 32  Appendix 1 \n \norganizations  (MF-NGOs),  private  sector  pawnshops,  and  numerous  programs  of  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka with rural credit components; and (iii) informal sources  including \nrotating savings and credit associations, input suppliers, traders, moneylenders, landlords, \nfriends, and relatives.  \n \n6.  NSB and its predecessors have been mobilizing savings since 1832. Savings and credit \ncooperatives have functioned for nearly a century and now have five million members. Many \nMF-NGOs and community-based organizations started rural savings and group-based lending \nprograms in the 1980s for poverty reduction and social development. Subsequent government \npolicies of providing RF as a tool for poverty reduction required state-owned commercial banks \nto provide financial services to the rural poor. In 1986, the Government established regional \nrural  development  banks  to  provide  normal  and  subsidized  rural  credit,  which  were  later \nconverted into six RDBs. The government-operated SBS program, started in 1997, has grown \nrapidly in terms of number of societies and total loan portfolio. As a result, RF outreach in Sri \nLanka is relatively high compared to other countries in the region.  \n \n7.  RFIs  in  Sri  Lanka  have  traditionally  emphasized  savings  (Table  A1.1).  NSB  has \nSLRs134 billion in 13.5 million deposit accounts, many held by rural savers who access \naccounts through 4,042 postal agencies. RDBs also collect significant amounts of savings. \nSavings by semiformal RFIs totaled almost SLRs24 billion in 2000. Cooperatives are the largest \nsemiformal mobilizers of savings, accepting almost SLRs20 billion through the CRB and TCCS \nnetworks. SBSs also collect a significant amount of savings. MF-NGOs, though not legally \nallowed, accept deposits either as compulsory, voluntary, or equity contributions. Commercial \nbanks do not classify their accounts as urban or rural, and are, therefore, not included in Table \nA1.1, but also mobilize savings from rural areas. \n \nTable A1.1: Deposits at Major Rural Financial Institutionsa  \n(SLRs million) \n \nRural Finance Institutions  Savings  Special Savings  Fixed Deposits  Shares  Total \nCRBs  10,870  \u2014  3,937  \u2014  14,807 \nTCCSs  1,757  902  739  841  4,239 \nSANASA Development Bank  194  12  810  161  1,177 \nSBSs  2,033  \u2014  \u2014  983  3,016 \nRDBs  2,731  305  899  1,060  4,995 \nSEEDS (MF-NGO)  488  138  \u2014  \u2014  626 \nJanashakthi (MF-NGO)  21  7  1  17  46 \nTotal  18,094  1,364  6,386  3,062  28,906 \nCRBs = cooperative  rural banks, TCCSs = thrift and credit cooperative societies, SBSs = Samurdhi Banking \nSocieties, RDBs = regional development banks, SEEDS = Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services, \nMF-NGO = microfinance-nongovernment organization. \na As of December 2000. \nSource: ADB. 2002.

At end-2000, there was approximately SLRs50 billion of rural credit supply for both micro \nloans, up to SLRs100,000, and non-micro loans provided by the formal and semiformal sectors \n(Table A1.2). At the prevailing lending interest rate,4 the demand for rural credit is estimated at \nSLRs60 billion. The present supply of SLRs50 billion leaves a gap of SLRs10 billion. Of this, \nhalf relates to micro loans. The demand could be significantly higher if the constraints imposed \nby limited access of medium- to long-term credit were removed.  \n \n                                                 \n4  14\u201316% for state-owned commercial banks, 20\u201322% for private commercial banks, and 18\u201328% for others. \n  ", "  Appendix 1   33\n9.  Cooperatives are the main suppliers of micro loans but CRBs, the major arm of the \ncooperative sector, have a very low credit to deposit ratio, indicating weak credit delivery \ncapacity.

In the absence of a conducive RF policy, government participation \nand control of RF were perpetuated on the understanding that (i) access to cheap institutional \ncredit could induce investment; (ii) government intervention in the sector was required to ensure \nsufficient flow of rural credit; and (iii) banks, both commercial and specialized, had a social \nresponsibility to serve the rural clientele even if it meant incurring losses. The Government \npursued this approach through directed credit, state-owned RFIs, concessional refinance, and \nloans at below-cost interest rates. In this repressive environment RFIs and CBs had little, if any, \nincentive to adopt sound practices and enhance portfolio quality through strict credit appraisal \nand delinquency management. As a result, RF suffers from weak governance, poor repayment \nrates,5 high transaction costs, weak supervision, and recurring losses that add to the fiscal \nburden. Despite some success in credit expansion, availability of medium- to long-term credit in \nrural areas has remained limited.  \n \n11.  The absence of RF policy has led to proliferation of legislation that allows establishment \nof fundamentally unsustainable RFIs. More significantly, in the majority of RFIs accountancy \nstandards,  transparency,  management  information  systems,  and  information  technology \nplatforms are rudimentary. In most cases the real financial status of RFIs is hidden. CRBs do \nnot have independent accounting and reporting from their parent  multipurpose cooperatives. \nThe  government-sponsored  programs  such  as  SBSs  do  not  include  in  their  accounts \nadministrative costs borne by the Government. Many RFIs are unsupervised or operate without \nproper prudential regulations. Conflicts prevail in terms of ownership and regulation, as CBSL is \n                                                 \n5  Repayment rate refers to collection as a percentage of loans due. \n ", " 34  Appendix 1 \n \nboth part owner and regulator of RDBs. Weak supervisory infrastructure in the cooperative \nsector results in inadequate supervision of CRBs, despite the fact that they hold substantial \ndeposits from nearly 5 million  members and nonmembers. The legal status of MF-NGOs \nremains ambiguous in terms of their right to mobilize deposits.  \n \n12.  The performance of the majority of RFIs do not conform to sustainability norms when \nassessed against internationally accepted industry standards. Many RFIs are heavily dependent \non government subsidies and external agency funds and the majority of RFIs are far from \nfinancial  self-sufficiency  (Table  A1.3).  Low  sustainability  of  RFIs  stems  from  absence  of \nperformance management systems based on tangible financial indicators; lack of sufficient \nmanagerial expertise; and deviation from best practice standards. In a situation of recurring \nlosses, investment in institutional capacity is neither a priority nor are there sufficient training \ninstitutions and arrangements for meeting capacity-building needs of the RF sector.  \n \nTable A1.3: Viability Ratios of Major Rural Financial Institutionsa (%) \n \nRural Finance Institutions  Operational Self-Sufficiencyb  Financial Self-Sufficiencyc \nCRBsd  83  83 \nSBSse  43  38 \nRDBsf  117  103g \nSEEDS (MF-NGO)  72  55 \nJanashakthi (MF-NGO)  130  82 \nCRBs = cooperative rural banks, SBSs = Samurdhi Banking Societies, RDBs = regional development banks, SEEDS \n= Sarvodaya Economic Enterprise Development Services, MF-NGO = microfinance-nongovernment organization. \na  As of December 2001. \nb  Operational self-sufficiency = total operational income/(total operational costs + financing costs + loan loss \nprovisions). \nc  Financial self-sufficiency = total financial revenue/total operational cost - less donations and all subsidies including \nsubsidized interest and inflation adjustments. \nd  Average of five sample well performing and poorly performing CRBs. \ne  Average of three sample average performing SBSs. \nf  Average of six RDBs. \ng  Data for indirect subsidies for RDBs are not available, thus the figure excludes adjustment for subsidies. \nSource: Annual reports of RFIs; and ADB. 2001.

The weak credit \ndiscipline that accompanies such interventions is reflected, for instance, in nonperforming loans \nof about 20\u201330% among RFIs and the RF portfolio of commercial banks. Only about two thirds \nof CRBs are reported to be financially viable. However, due to lack of transparency, it is not \nclear how many are actually profitable after adjustments for loan loss provisions, write-offs, and \nsubsidies. SBSs and other government programs also entail large recurrent costs. While a few \nlarge MF-NGOs are moving toward self-sustainability, the vast majority of smaller and less well-\nestablished MF-NGOs are not operating on a very sound basis. The lack of transparency and \nstandardized financial reporting impedes a detailed assessment of their financial condition.  \n \n14.  Besides a general deficiency in service quality, there is growing gap between supply and \ndemand for rural credit from formal and semiformal sectors. The lowest end of the market \ncomprising the poor, marginal, and subsistence farmers is restricted to borrowing amounts that \nare much below these people\u2019s needs. For example, most RFIs require collateral such as land \nor  personal  guarantors  for  loans  above  SLRs50,000.  Due  to  this,  rural  small  and  micro \nenterprises  have  great  difficulty  in  borrowing  the  amounts  necessary  for  upscaling  and \ndiversifying, which are also hindered by the low levels of skills in rural areas. Private commercial \nbanks, while keen to expand their rural outreach, are better equipped to provide larger loans. \nSystemic linkages between MF-NGOs and commercial banks have yet to emerge.  \n \n  ", "  Appendix 1   35\n15.  Lessons Learned. The evolution of RF markets in Sri Lanka has been considerably \ndistorted, resulting in fragmented markets that vary in development and density by region. \nHighly inefficient supply-driven application of capital and weak nonmarket-driven management \nare generally regarded as the basic reasons for failure. Specific causes of failure revolve around \nhigh operating costs, losses, and decapitalization. The cumulative effect of financial repression \nand dependence on government has affected institutional norms that remain averse to change \nand accountability. The RF sector as a whole requires a complete reorientation before it can \nmove forward on a continuum toward self-sufficiency. A systemic response to address the \nissues in RF is essential for reviving the rural economy through investments in agriculture and in \nrural enterprises.  \n \n16.  Strengthening RF Markets. The Government\u2019s ongoing economic reform program aims \nto  reduce  poverty  and  help  establish  lasting  peace  through  relief,  rehabilitation,  and \nreconstruction to reduce conflict-related poverty. Broad-based rural development is the key \nstrategy for poverty reduction including employment, income generation, and access to financial \nand business services.  \n \n17.  The most critical element in the RF reform process is a policy paradigm to shape the \nnorms and incentives in which RFIs operate and enable sustainable RF markets to develop. \nThe paradigm will emphasize a financial system development approach where RF market \ndevelopment  is  placed  in  the  broader  perspective  of  financial  sector  development.  Direct \ninterventions by the Government will be limited to situations where identifiable market failures \nexist and cost-effective, transparent means to address them are available. A supervisory and \nregulatory framework to stem proliferation of RFIs through a stricter entry threshold and financial \nand operating standards will follow the policy framework. Considering the large number of small \nRFIs, a second tier agency would provide flexible supervisory options compared to CBSL. The \npolicy and regulatory framework will provide the basis for institutional reforms anchored on good \ngovernance, transparency, and rigorous financial discipline. The private sector stake must be \ngradually  enhanced  in  the  reformed  RFIs  to  level  the  playing  field  for  competition  and \ncommercialization. Sector capacity constraints must also be simultaneously addressed.  \n \n18.  Considering the infrastructure and skills deficit context in which most RFIs operate, it is \nimportant  that  RF  reforms  are  accompanied  by  significant  investments  in  demand-side \ndevelopment that enable the rural poor, for instance through better skills and access to markets, \nto effectively utilize RF services. For dealing with core poverty issues in conflict-affected areas, \na flexible approach for reactivating, strengthening, or establishing new institutions is required. \nWhile reforms will eventually enable an adequate response to demand and supply gaps, \ninvestments directed for specific underserved market niches will be required in the short to \nmedium term.  \n \n19.  The  strategic  components  represent  a  shift  to  a  demand-driven  approach  where \nsustainable RFIs, over a period of time, are expected to achieve greater outreach, including the \npoor, and product diversity resulting in more clients served and their diverse needs better met. \nThis will diminish political interference and willful defaults. The resulting sustainable system will \nbe  able  to  support  income  expansion  and  poverty  reduction  and  reduce  fiscal  pressure, \nenabling increased investment in development. This reform agenda will significantly contribute \nto the Government\u2019s aim to reduce poverty to 20% and increase economic growth to 7% a year \nby 2005. \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \nREGIONAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS \n \nA.  Legal Framework and Ownership  \n \n1.  District-based regional rural development banks (RRDBs) established in 1986 were \nconsolidated  into  six  regional  development  banks  (RDBs)  in  1997.  This  process  involved \nfinancial consolidation, a broader ownership base, and shareholder-appointed board members. \nThe paid up capital of each RDB is SLRs150 million. As of September 2002, the majority \nshareholder was Central Bank of Sri Lanka  (CBSL) with participation of Bank of Ceylon, \nPeople's Bank, National Savings Bank, and CBSL Employee Provident Fund (Table A2.1). Due \nto its shareholding structure, RDBs are categorized as quasi-government financial institutions \nand are considered susceptible to political influence. RDBs are under CBSL supervision. There \nis a proposal to establish three RDBs in the conflict-affected areas of the north and the east. \nHowever, no time frame has yet been announced.  \n \nTable A2.1: Ownership Structure and Network of Regional Development Banksa \n  \nSabara- \nRDB  Wayamba  Kandurata  Ruhuna  Rajarata  Uva \ngamuwa \nOwnership (% share)             \n  Central Bank of Sri Lanka   68          68  68  68  52  52 \n  Bank of Ceylon   8   8    8  8  12  12 \n  National Savings Bank   8   8    8  8  12  12 \n  People\u2019s Bank   8   8    8  8  12  12 \n  CBSL Employee Provident Fund   8   8    8  8  12  12 \n             \n Number of branches            34   32   41  37         21      26 \n Number of staff             316   256  324  347       152     220 \na As of September 2002.   \nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka.   \n \nB.  Operations  \n \n2.  RDBs provide normal and subsidized credit to individuals and businesses in rural areas. \nThe deposit and loan outstanding amounts at end-2001 were SLRs4.7 billion and SLRs5.5 \nbillion, respectively. About 80% of loans are microcredit loans under SLRs100,000. Personal \nguarantees from customers or immovable property are used as collateral. Lending interest rates \nvary between 12% and 27%. The lending portfolio is diversified (Table A2.2), with pawnbroking \nconstituting nearly half of the portfolio.

The organizational and operating cost structures of RDBs mirror those of commercial \nbanks and are inappropriate for their roles as microcredit providers. In some cases, they have \nshown a tendency to move away from their traditional client base of rural poor and low-income \nhouseholds and provide larger loans. While the average loan size of RDBs is small, this does \nnot necessarily indicate that they are effectively satisfying the credit needs of the rural poor.  \n \nC.  Profitability and Portfolio Performance  \n \n4.  RDBs inherited many portfolio problems from the RRDBs. Portfolio quality remains \nproblematic for all six RDBs. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of the total portfolio range \nfrom 16% to 33% (Table A2.3). Each RDB has established a special debt recovery program to \nreduce nonperforming loans. Kandurata, Sabaragamuwa, and Wayamba RDBs show low levels \nof nonperforming loans compared to the other three RDBs. Sabaragamuwa in particular has \nimproved its portfolio quality. Ruhuna, Rajarata, and Uva RDBs have comparatively high levels \nof nonperforming loans, with Rajarata\u2019s loan portfolio having deteriorated over the past 3 years. \nThe aggregate repayment rate (as percentage of amount due) for the RDBs was 88% at end-\n2001. Loans are classified as nonperforming after 90 days and are subject to aging analysis. \n \nTable A2. 3: Financial Performance of Regional Development Banksa \nSabara- \nPerformance Indicator  Wayamba  Kandurata  Ruhuna  Rajarata  Uva \ngamuwa \nReturn on Average Assets (%)  1.44  1.44  0.96  1.24  -1.48  0.84 \nNonperforming portfolio (%)  17  16  16  21  25  33 \nTotal assets (SLRs million)  1,742  1,036  1,558  2,031  675  824 \nTotal deposits (SLRs million)  929  596  1,073  1,160  441  546 \nLoans and advances (SLRs million)  1,365  728  1,091  1,320  436  578 \nPaid-up capital (SLRs million)  150  150  150  150  100  100 \nTotal shareholder funds (SLRs million)  250  176  185  316  126  121 \nProfit Before Tax (SLRs million)  53  24  15  48  -10  7 \nProfit After Tax (SLRs million)  25  15  15  25  -10  7 \na As of December 2001. \nSource: Regional Development Banks. \n \n5.  While five out of the six RDBs have shown nominal profits, it is not clear whether these \nprofits were adjusted for indirect subsidies. CBSL is of the opinion that these reflect a true \npicture and that the profitability of RDBs is improving despite the high level of nonperforming \nloans. CBSL-prescribed prudential guidelines apply to RDBs.  \n \nD.  Issues \n \n6.  RDBs  have  fared  better  than  their  predecessors,  the  RRDBs.  However,  there  is \nsignificant room for improvement in governance, transparency, human resources, and systems \nand procedures. There is no private sector representation on the board of directors to provide \ncommercial expertise or orientation. RDBs need to urgently focus on enhancing portfolio quality \nby reducing the nonperforming loans and acquiring modern technology for credit appraisal and \ndelinquency management. Without reducing subsidy dependence RDBs will neither become \nautonomous nor sustainable. RDBs have to realize that the lower end of the rural finance \nmarket provides sufficient avenues for profitable operations and should refrain from diversifying \ninto market segments and products for which they are ill equipped. The Government has \ndecided to divest 80% of the CBSL stake in RDBs and facilitate their restructuring under the \nRural Finance Sector Development Program.  \n ", "38  Appendix 3 \nCOOPERATIVE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS \n \n1.  Sri Lanka has one of the oldest cooperative movements in the world, dating back to \n1906. Cooperative societies are governed by the Cooperative Societies Act of 1972. The 10,518 \nprimary cooperatives have a membership of about 5 million and represent a significant political \nconstituency. Over 8,000 cooperatives are engaged  in savings and credit activities. Their \nnationwide network provides half of the total annual number of micro loans.1 Cooperative rural \nbanks  (CRBs)  and  thrift  and  credit  cooperative  societies  (TCCSs)2  are  the  two  major \ncooperative systems providing financial services.  \n \nA.  Cooperative Rural Banks \n2.  Organization and Governance. The CRBs are the most prominent member-owned and \nmanaged financial cooperatives, covering urban as well as rural areas. At the end of 2001, 311 \nCRBs had 1,196 branches and 3.9 million members. CRBs demonstrate many strong features, \nincluding  low-cost  operations,  community  orientation,  rural  culture,  low-risk  loan  products, \nsavings-led financial services, and rural bank-characterized business operations. CRBs are not \nsupervised by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL). Originally, the People's Bank, a state-\nowned commercial  bank,  exercised supervision, provided liquidity support, and managed the \nsurplus (savings over loans) of the CRBs. After the discontinuation of this arrangement in 1992, \nthe CRBs were placed under the management and supervision of the Ministry of Co-operatives, \nwhich does not have adequate capacity to supervise financial institutions. \n \n3.  Most CRBs  are not independent legal entities but are departments of  multipurpose \ncooperative societies (MPCSs). Such \u201ccaptive\u201d CRBs therefore have no capital of their own and \ncome under the complete control of their MPCS. Separate financial accounts to reflect a true \nand fair picture of financial status are not prepared for captive CRBs. Poor accounting and lack \nof separate CRB balance sheets increase depositors' risk. In addition to captive CRBs, there \nare five \u201cfree-standing\u201d CRBs (CRBs that are not departments of MPCSs). There are also 14 \ndistrict CRB unions, formed to provide the services formerly provided by the People\u2019s Bank, that \npool  CRB  surpluses  and  invest  them  in  a  variety  of  vehicles  including  loans  to  larger \nnonmember entities and MPCSs.3 The withdrawal of CRB surpluses from the People\u2019s Bank \nhas accelerated in recent years due to the weak financial position of the People\u2019s Bank. There \nhave been reports of district CRB unions lending to MPCSs, using the CRB deposit funds. \n \n4.  In addition to savings and credit through the captive CRBs, MPCSs engage in a wide \nvariety of commercial activities including consumer stores, supermarkets, transport, petrol filling \nstations, bakeries, and rice mills. Many MPCSs have experienced recurring losses in these \ncommercial activities, which have eroded the value of their equity. The surpluses of captive \nCRBs, which in some cases are the sole profitable activity of MPCSs, are incorporated into the \ntotal MPCS surplus, leaving the CRB with inadequate capital adequacy. Captive CRBs come \nunder the control of their MPCS Board of Directors, and the General Manager of the MPCS \nserves as the chief executive officer of the CRB. Generally, neither the MPCS Board nor the \nMPCS General Manager has adequate experience and skills to operate a financial institution. \nThis arrangement compromises good governance and may influence the lending decisions of \nthe captive CRBs, which are often the primary financier of clients of the commercial units of \nMPCSs.  \n                                                 \n1 Loans below SLRs100,000. The aggregate microloan supply in Sri Lanka is estimated at SLRs18.23 billion in 1.65 \nmillion accounts. \n2 Savings and credit societies organized under farmer organizations are also in the nature of cooperatives.  \n3 Over and above what the attached CRB can provide. \n  ", "  Appendix 3  39 \n5.  Operations. CRBs can mobilize savings from members and nonmembers, and savings \nfrom nonmembers now constitute about 70% of total CRB deposits (Table A3.1). At end-\nDecember 2001, CRBs deposits amounted to SLRs16.6 billion in 5.8 million savings accounts, \nmainly from rural areas. The average savings size was SLRs2,860 per account. Savings \ncontinue to grow, by 15% during 2001. CRBs can lend only to members. CRB loans are mainly \nfor housing and productive activities but pawning is an increasingly important activity. CRBs \nalso provide services such as collection of utility bills and payment of pensions to farmers. \nCollectively, the CRBs disbursed SLRs2.3 billion during 2000. The aggregate outstanding loan \nat end-2001 was SLRs5.9 billion with an average loan size of about SLRs8,500. Loan funds are \nprovided entirely from deposits.  \n \nTable A3.1: Cooperative Rural Bank Portfolio Performance  \n(SLRs millions) \n \nYear  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \nTotal deposits mobilized  9,871  11,234  12,914  14,807  16,576 \nTotal loans and pawning  5,166  5,555  7,232  6,951  5,906 \nTotal investments  9,553  10,494  10,996  9,461  10,520 \nTotal loans and investments  14,719  16,049  18,228  15,648  16,426 \nSource: Department of Cooperative Development.  \n   \n6.  Portfolio Quality and Profitability.  The  Department  of  Cooperative  Development \n(DCD) reports that 1,174 of the total of 1,507 CRB outlets are profitable. However, this is highly \nunlikely when the overall repayment rate is only 65%. Provisioning that is not based on portfolio \nquality and failure to charge CRB-related MPCS overheads to CRB profitability have inflated the \n\u201cprofits\u201d of CRBs. In the absence of separate financial statements, CRB profitability is not clear. \nStudy of a sample of captive and free-standing CRBs shows that operational and financial self-\nsufficiency vary depending on their status (Table A3.2). The two free-standing CRBs achieve \nover 100% financial self-sufficiency and have adequate yield on the loan portfolio. \n \nTable A3. 2: Summary Financial Performance of Sample Cooperative Rural Banks, 2001a \n \n \nFree-Standing CRBs     Captive CRBs  \n \nSample Cooperative Rural Bank  Polgahawela  Menikhinna    Rambewa  Anuradapura  Shara-\nwasthipura \nTotal financial revenue (SLRs '000)  25,275  20,624    560  922  1,070 \nAdjusted administrative costs (SLRs '000)  7,734  5,784    477  826  396 \nLoan-loss provision (SLRs '000)  69  199    1,198  89  186 \nAdjusted cost of funds (SLRs '000)  14,434  10,804    330  598  608 \nNet financial income (SLRs '000)  3,038  3,837    (1,445)  (591)  (120) \nOperational self-sufficiency (%)  114  123    28  61  90 \nFinancial self-sufficiency (%)  113  111    27  67  95 \nActual average gross loan portfolio yield  15.62  16.94    4.54  8.81  9.82 \nCRBs = cooperative rural banks. \na As of December. \nSource: Department of Cooperative Development. \n \n7.  It is estimated that a CRB with a poorly performing loan portfolio may lose as much as \nSLRs13 for every SLRs100 it lends. Lending interest rates do not factor in risks, and the poor \nquality of existing loans depresses the portfolio yield. CRBs' loan classification system is \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \nsignificantly different from the banking sector and CRBs do not have a policy of loan-loss \nprovisioning or writing off, although sometimes the external auditor from DCD recommends \nsome provisions. CRBs maintain that their unique system for collecting overdues justifies this. \nLoans without any principal or interest repayments are treated as past due 6 months from the \nfirst default, during which time five repayment notices are issued. The Commissioner, Co-\noperative Development, then refers the loan for arbitration. Failure to settle at this stage gives \nthe CRB the right to refer the matter to the magistrates court, which is required to act on the \naward made at arbitration stage and order it to be collected as a fine due to the state. This gives \nthe order to pay great weight: failure to comply can lead to imprisonment but even this does not \nextinguish the CRB claim. The system appears to work but the administrative machinery is very \nslow, sometimes taking years, and subject to corruption.  \n   \n8.  Issues. CRBs are probably the only unsubsidized RF network in Sri Lanka. CRBs have \nbeen in existence for a long time and have survived without external support, in some cases \nsustaining the parent MPCSs, for at least a decade. The CRB model has several strong \ncharacteristics that are essential to becoming a viable and sustainable rural finance institution. \nUnfortunately, these strengths are almost nullified by a poor regulatory system, political capture, \npoor administration, very poor accounting standards, and a poor auditing system. Surpluses of \ncaptive CRBs have been inappropriately deployed by parent MPCSs. Significant amounts of \nsmall depositors\u2019 funds are at risk.  CRBs need to operate as distinct financial entities with \nautonomy to pursue viable business operations. This is only possible through fundamental \nchanges in legal, governance, supervisory, financial, and institutional arrangements.  \n \nB.  Thrift and Credit Cooperative Societies \n \n9.  The primary thrift and credit cooperative societies (TCCSs) were the first cooperatives to \nbe established after the enactment of the Cooperative Act of 1911. By 1965, there were \nreportedly some 4,500 TCCSs. At end-December 2000, the numbers had grown to some 8,500 \nTCCSs with a membership of 905,106, although many are reported to be dormant. TCCSs are \nwidely spread throughout the country in both rural and urban areas. TCCSs specialize in \nmicrofinance, providing about 15% of total micro loans. District unions were formed to support \nthe TCCSs and an apex organization, the Federation of Thrift and Credit Cooperatives (FTCC) \nof Sri Lanka was established. However, the FTCC is just a loose network of TCCSs. It has no \ncentral management and does not act either as a supervisor or an effective coordinator. As a \nresult, the TCCSs suffer from weak accounting and information management, low efficiency, \nand nonviability. In addition, the systems and procedures are not compatible among TCCSs at \nthe primary and district levels.  \n \n10.  SANASA Development Bank (SDB) was established as a licensed specialized bank in \n1997 and is owned by the TCCSs, district unions, and the FTCC. SDB's role is \u201cto mobilize \ndeposits at competitive rates of interest and invest such deposits in community-based lending \nprograms with particular focus on TCCS, their members, and micro enterprises.\u201d4 SDB is taking \nover some of the lending to TCCS from the FTCC. As of June 2001, SDB had total loans \noutstanding of SLRs127.5 million. While SDB mainly lends to the district and primary societies, \nit also lends to microfinance-nongovernment organizations, community-based organizations, \nself-help groups, and individuals who are not society members. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

Background \n \n118.  The National Development Trust Fund (NDTF) was established in 1992 to manage a \nPoverty Alleviation Project, including a credit fund for lending to partner rural finance institutions \n(RFIs) to onlend to the poor, a human resources development fund, a rural works fund, and a \nnutrition fund. The Poverty Alleviation Project was funded by the World Bank, Kreditanstalt f?r \nWiederaufbau, and the Government of Sri Lanka. While NDTF's noncredit operations were \nwound up in 1998, it continues as a wholesale lender to RFIs. At end-2001, NDTF had a loan \nportfolio of SLRs373.9 million net of provisions of SLRs135.8 million. In addition, SLRs700.8 \nmillion are invested in government securities and fixed deposits. NDTF is governed by a 15-\nmember Board of Trustees, selected by the Government and comprising nine public sector and \nsix private sector representatives.  \n \nB.  National Development Trust Fund Performance \n \n119.  NDTF's performance, outreach, and impact on the microfinance (MF) sector have been \nlimited compared with its resources and market potential. Concerns center on its scale of \noperations,  loan  portfolio  management,  selection  and  support  of  partner  RFIs,  and  weak \ninstitutional  capacity.  NDTF  disbursed  SLRs337.6 million in loans in 2001 to partner RFIs \nincluding microfinance nongovernment organizations (MF-NGOs), cooperative rural banks, thrift \nand credit cooperative societies, regional development banks, and other banks. As of June \n2002, NDTF had 160 partner RFIs, of which 81 were active borrowers with outstanding loans \ntotaling SLRs597.1 million. Of this, SLRs127.9 million (21.4%) was considered doubtful, mostly \nmade up of long-standing overdues with thrift and credit cooperative societies, cooperative rural \nbanks, and MF-NGOs. Most of these are probably unrecoverable. The financial viability of \nNDTF is weak. Partner RFIs often repay loans from new NDTF borrowings because of the low \ncost of NDTF funds. The interest spread is estimated to cover only 30% of NDTF\u2019s operating \ncosts excluding overhead charges.  \n \n120.  The present legal status of NDTF as a trust does not permit a legally binding lender-\nborrower relationship with its partner RFIs. While NDTF remains the main wholesale lender to \nMF-NGOs, providing loans to 60 of them in 2001, lending to MF-NGOs constituted only 26% of \ntotal lending in that year. Partner RFIs include commercial banks that have access to other \nsources of funds. Further, NDTF has not provided any significant capacity-building support to \nMF-NGOs or encouraged their adoption of best practices, either through direct assistance or by \nusing its position as a lender to exert influence. NDTF does not have sufficient staff with \ntechnical and managerial skills for effectively implementing its program.  \n \nC.  Institutional Reform \n \n121.  As  part  of  the  Rural  Finance  Sector  Development  Program,  NDTF  has  been \nincorporated under the Companies Act No.17 of 1982 to provide it with a proper legal basis to \nact as a lending institution. Institutional strengthening support will be provided to transform \nNDTF into a viable MF apex organization capable of acting as a focal point for development of \nthe MF sector with the goal of rapidly expanding outreach, particularly in the conflict-affected \nareas, and guiding MF-NGOs towards financial sustainability. \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \nSAMURDHI PROGRAM AND SAMURDHI BANKING SOCIETIES \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  The Samurdhi Program, the main poverty reduction scheme of the Government of Sri \nLanka has operated since 1995. The program includes income  transfer (welfare grant) and \ncommunity-based rural infrastructure development components. The Samurdhi Banking Society \n(SBS) Program was introduced in March 1997 as part of the Samurdhi Program to promote \nsavings and investment in rural areas. The SBS Program is operated by the Samurdhi Authority \nof Sri Lanka under the purview of the Ministry of Samurdhi, Agriculture and Livestock.  \n2.  The SBS Program is based on the concept of group collateral and collective savings of \nfive-member groups, the great majority of whom receive Samurdhi welfare grants. Successful \ngroups join together to form autonomous village-level societies\u2014SBSs\u2014which are managed by \nSamurdhi managers and supervised by divisional secretaries of the Government. Each SBS \nmember purchases SLRs500 worth of shares to become eligible to borrow. With over 1.7 million \nmembers in 2002, the SBS Program is the largest microfinance institution (MFI) in Sri Lanka \nand one of the largest in the world. Over 60% of shareholders are female. \nB.  Samurdhi Banking Society Performance \n \n3.  The SBS Program has achieved tremendous growth in terms of membership, savings \nmobilization, and credit disbursement, with high repayment rates. As of June 2002, there were \n989 SBSs operating in 286 divisional secretariats and a further 8 SBSs will be opened soon. \nThere  were  3.5  million  savings  accounts,  including  compulsory  deposits  of  Samurdhi \nbeneficiaries. Total deposits at mid-year 2002 amounted to SLRs6.7 billion, an increase of over \n300% since 2000. The value of paid-up capital  amounted to SLRs1.5 billion, an increase of \nSLRs120 million relative to the previous year. The total value of loans issued from inception by \nSBSs totals SLRs5.5 billion and of this, half was issued in 2001 alone, making the SBS Program \nthe fastest growing loan program in Sri Lanka. Outstanding loans of SBS at end-2001 amounted \nto SLRs2.3 billion with 429,231 active loans. The on-time loan recovery rate as of June 2002 \nwas reported as 93.4%, which is the best recovery ratio among MFIs in Sri Lanka. The high \nrepayment rate is mainly due to the large number of Samurdhi development officers employed \nin the field as well as the system that pays welfare grants through SBSs, putting SBS managers \nin a good position to ensure repayment. \n \n4.  However, the SBS operation is very expensive. The operational cost,1 excluding the cost \nof funds, of an average performing SBS in 2001 was approximately 73% of its average gross \nloans outstanding, significantly higher than typical successful MFIs in the region.2 No SBS \nattained 100% financial self-sufficiency.3 The financial self-sufficiency of the best performing \nSBS was estimated at 78.7%, while that of the average performing SBSs was 38.5% (Table \nA5). As the majority of SBS costs are borne by the Government, and with the current staff and \noperational cost level, most SBSs are expected to be unsustainable over the long run. It is \n                                                 \n1  Including allocation of 75% of the salary and allowances of government staff assigned to the SBS. The Samurdhi \nAuthority of Sri Lanka argues that the government staff working for SBSs also contribute to other components of \nthe Samurdhi Program (welfare grants, insurance, community infrastructure) and therefore only a small part of the \ncost of such personnel should be allocated to SBSs. However, even after allocation of a lower proportion of \ngovernment staff costs, the SBSs remain very high cost MFIs. \n2  The ratio in other MFIs of similar size in Bangladesh is 5% for the Association for Social Advancement, 8% for the \nBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and 9% for the Grameen Bank. \n3  According to the definition by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest, financial self-sufficiency = total financial \nrevenue/total operational cost - donations and all subsidies including subsidized interest and inflation adjustments. \n  ", "  Appendix 5  43 \nestimated that SBSs as a whole have at least 60% excess staff and about 99% of SBSs are \ncurrently unprofitable. Restructuring measures such as further cost reductions, expanded loan \nand  saving  activities,  and  efficiency  and  productivity  improvements  are  necessary  for  the \nmajority of SBSs to achieve financial sustainability. \n \nTable A5: Summary Operational Efficiency Performance of a Selected Representative \nSample of Samurdhi Banking Societiesa \n \nItem  Best  Top 20%  Average  Poorly \nPerforming  Performing  Performing \nSamurdhi Banking Society  Rakwana  Dambulla  Polgahawela  Wariyapola \nFinancial Revenue from Loan Portfolio (SLRs)  20.48  24.26  26.21  24.96 \nAdjusted Administrative Costs (SLRs)  37.29  57.72  72.88  81.09 \nLoan Loss (provision) (SLRs)  0.78  6.13  0.77  7.56 \nEstimated Cost of Funds (SLRs)  9.35  9.35  9.35  9.35 \nNet Financial Income (SLRs)  (26.94)  (48.94)  (56.79)  (73.04) \nOperational Self-sufficiency (%)  94.56  73.37  42.70  32.93 \nFinancial Self-sufficiency (%)  78.73  65.59  38.45  30.69 \na Per 100 units of gross loan portfolio outstanding. \nSources: ADB. 2001.

The Samurdhi Authority of Sri Lanka does not produce separate audited accounts for its \nbanking and financial activities and the SBS accounts are not consolidated. SBSs depend on \nthe Divisional Secretary Office to prepare their final accounts and conduct the annual audit. A \nlarge number of SBS accounts are not audited. The allocation of government-subsidized costs \nis not included in individual SBS accounts. SBS operating surpluses appear to be appropriated \nfor various cost centers within the Government, which would impair the ability of an SBS to build \na sound equity base for its independent operation. Further, SBSs are not under the supervision \nof any independent supervisor. \n \nC.  Proposed Institutional Reform \n123.  Broad-based institutional reforms are needed to transform SBSs into autonomous and \nviable financial institutions to play a significant role in rural poverty reduction in Sri Lanka. SBSs \nneed to move toward operational self-sufficiency by fundamentally restructuring their operations. \nWithin the scope of the Rural Finance Sector Development Program, portfolio analysis and \ndiagnostic  reviews  were  undertaken  with  the  objective  of  developing  an  SBS  Institutional \nStrengthening  Plan  to  strengthen  SBSs'  institutional  capabilities  as  viable  rural  finance \ninstitutions  and  poverty  reduction  instruments  to  achieve  greater  cost-effectiveness  and \noperational sufficiency. The portfolio analysis covers the performance analysis of loan, equity, \nand liquid asset portfolios of selected SBSs and the impact of portfolio quality on overall \nfinancial  condition  and  performance.  The  diagnostic  review  analyzes  SBSs\u2019  organization, \nmanagement,  operations,  credit  policies,  and  related  processes.  The  SBS  Institutional \nStrengthening Plan incorporating the outputs of portfolio analysis and diagnostic reviews will \ncover improvement of governance, operational standards including accounting and auditing, \nfinancial viability, and outreach.  \n \n ", "44   Appendix 6 \nMICROFINANCE-NONGOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS \n \n1.  There  are  about  200  microfinance-nongovernment  organizations  (MF-NGOs)  in  Sri \nLanka, of which four are large entities and the rest are small multisector NGOs. Many of the MF-\nNGOs  apply  an  \u201cMF-plus\u201d  approach  whereby  borrowers  are  supported  by  other  services, \nprimarily training and business development services. As a result, MF-NGOs are not focused on \nsustainable provision of financial services and their financial intermediation skills are weak, \nespecially in accounting and loan analysis. A brief description of the large MF-NGOs follows. \n \n2.  Sarvodaya  Economic  Enterprise  Development  Service  (SEEDS).  SEEDS  is  a \nregistered company limited by guarantee, established in 1986 by  Sarvodaya Shramadana \nSangamaya Movement (Sarvodaya), an NGO started in 1958 to empower villages through \nstrengthening their capacity to develop enterprises. Through its head office in Colombo and 11 \ndistrict  offices,  SEEDS  serves  as  a  wholesale  lender  to  Sarvodaya  village  societies  and \nSarvodaya village banks that onlend to their members. As part of its \u201cMF-plus\u201d approach, \nSEEDS also provides training, monitoring, supervision, and enterprise development support to \nSarvodaya societies and banks. As of March 2001, the SEEDS network had 177,974 loan \nclients with an outstanding portfolio of SLRs667 million, and SLRs358 million in savings in \n662,272 savings accounts. Women constitute 60% of clients.  \n \n3.  The operational and financial self-sufficiency1 of SEEDS at end-2001 was 72% and 55%, \nrespectively. While the repayment rate is 94%, 18.5% of loans to Sarvodaya societies and \nbanks are delinquent, of which about 76% are over 12 months in arrears. The overall portfolio \nquality of the network could be weaker still, as Sarvodaya societies and banks have weak \nfinancial management, supervision, and control systems. Their financial viability is also in doubt. \nThe SEEDS network requires substantial improvements in supervision, credit appraisal, and \ndelinquency management.  \n \n4.  Janashakthi.  As  an  offshoot  of  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka\u2019s  poverty  reduction \nprogram, Janashakthi began operations as a member-based MF-NGO in 1989. Janashakthi \nsocieties organized themselves into Janashakthi bank societies (JBSs) to pool individual and \ngroup savings and extend small loans. There are 67 JBSs with a total membership of 28,168 \nwith about 5,300 groups of five women each. The target market is families earning less than \nSLRs1,500 per month. At village level, the groups meet weekly with individuals contributing \nSLRs25 each time. In addition, each group member must subscribe SLRs500 in the capital of \nJBS. Savings and loans outstanding at end-December 2001 were SLRs29 million and SLRs91 \nmillion, respectively. Loan repayment rates average around 97%. The consolidated surplus of \nall JBSs was SLRs0.8 million at end-December 2001 or an average of SLRs11,370 per JBS. \nWhile most JBSs are profitable, expansion is affected by lack of funds for supporting its \nmultidimensional approach to poverty reduction covering health, nutrition, environment, and \nbanking. \n \n5.  Social Mobilization Foundation  is the banking arm of the Government\u2019s Integrated \nRural Development Project. It has around 10,000 clients with a revolving fund of SLRs20 million.  \n \n6.  Arthachariya Foundation. Founded in 1992, the Arthachariya Foundation has a strong \npoverty  focus,  working  only  with  the  poorest  in  the  villages.  It  has  a  revolving  fund  of \napproximately SLRs20 million and a client base of around 3,000.  \n                                                 \n1  The Consultative Group to Assist the Poorest defines financial self-sufficiency as total financial revenue/total \noperational cost - donations and all subsidies including subsidized interest and inflation adjustments. \n  ", " \nEXTERNAL AGENCY COORDINATION MATRIXa   \nRural Development  Agriculture   Microfinance  Financial Sector  Small and Medium \nEnterprises  \nAsian Development Bank   Asian Development Bank   Others   Asian Development Bank  Asian Development Bank \nInfrastructure, community development,  Investments in tea, rubber,  Microfinance services for  Developing financial  Regulatory reform and \nsocial capital, and some rural finance  coconuts and other perennial  small farmers and  institutions  strengthening of small and \n(RF).   crops, factory consolidation,  landless poor, and review  \u2022  Fourth Development  medium enterprise \n\u2022  Southern Province Rural Economic  marketing, research support, and  of existing financial  Finance Project ($75  capacities. \nAdvancement Project ($25 million)  integrated farming system.  institutions.  million)  \u2022  Small and Medium \n\u2022  North East Community Restoration  \u2022  Second Agriculture Program  \u2022  Rural Banking  Enterprise Sector \nand Development Project  ($60 million)  Innovations Project  World Bank  Development \n($25 million)  \u2022  Plantation Development  (Deutsche  Institutional Strengthening of  Program ($26 million) \n\u2022  North Central Province Rural  ($20 million)  Gesellschaft f\u00fcr  the Central Bank of Sri   \nDevelopment Project ($20 million)  \u2022  Plantation Reform Program  Technische  Lanka, fiscal stabilization, \n\u2022  Southern Province Rural  ($60 million)  Zusammenarbeit  improvement of the state-\nDevelopment Project ($38 million)  \u2022  Second Perennial Crops  (GTZ))  owned financial institutions, \n  Development Project ($20  \u2022  Small Farmers and  and diversifying savings \nWorld Bank   million)  Landless Credit  instruments. \nImprovement, better operation, and  \u2022  Tea Development Project  Project (IFAD)  \u2022  Central Bank of Sri \nmaintenance of irrigation facilities.

Background and Rationale  \n \n1.  Financing alone is insufficient to enable the poor to escape poverty. To utilize financial \nservices effectively, productive activities must allow microentrepreneurs to generate sufficient \nreturns to remain viable in the medium to long term. This requires an environment that permits \nand encourages microentrepreneurs to take benefit from market opportunities, and facilitates \ntheir continuous access to critical support services. Microenterprises in rural areas face serious \nconstraints, including inadequate physical infrastructure such as electricity and roads, lack of \nbusiness support including research and development and business advisory services, and a \nlow skill base. Private sector microenterprise development can be better realized by removing \nthese constraints while providing effective linkages to rural finance (RF) services.  \n \nB.  Objective \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s Rural Economy Resuscitation Fund (RERF), established to address \nrural social and economic constraints through small community-based investments, cannot \nrealize its potential due to inadequate resources. The Rural Finance Sector Development \nProgram  (RFSDP)  will  support  refocusing  and  enhancement  of  RERF  for  financing  rural \ncommunity-based investment projects with linkages to RF services. Strategic investments in \nskills development, marketing networks, infrastructure for improved distribution, and marketing \nof rural products to achieve better prices and community infrastructure such as storage facilities, \nsmall-scale  irrigation,  and  farmer  information  centers  will  catalyze  social  preparation  and \nentrepreneurial activity. Links to RF services will  enhance the ability of rural communities to \nbenefit from market opportunities.  \n \n3.  The RERF aims to support demand side development for the growth of the RF sector. \nThe objective of the RERF is, by providing support for community development, to develop the \ncapability of the poor to make efficient use of RF services for their income generating activities. \nRERF projects will be initiated, identified, designed, and implemented by rural communities in \ncollaboration with service providers including nongovernment organizations (NGOs).  \n \nC.  Management and Finance  \n \n4.  The RERF will be administered by the RERF Trust. The RERF Trust is chaired by the \nDirector General of the Ministry of Rural Economy (MRE) and administered by the trustees, \nconsisting of representatives from the Ministry of Finance and the private sector including \nNGOs.  The  trustees  are  appointed  by  the  Minister  of  Rural  Economy.  The  trustees  are \nresponsible, among others, for ensuring that the RERF is utilized for the purpose of poverty \nreduction and economic enhancement of rural communities, and approving investment and \noperational decisions arranged or recommended by the RERF Secretariat (the Secretariat).  \n \n5.  The administration and management of the RERF will be supported by the Secretariat, \nwhich consists of a chief executive officer, an engineer as a rural community infrastructure \nspecialist, and a gender and social development specialist. The Secretariat, with delegated \nauthority of the trustees, will process rural community investment proposals for RERF funding \nand other investment tasks for the approval by the trustees. The overall functions of the \nSecretariat will be (i) managing the RERF capital and facilitating its appropriate investment, \n(ii) processing the RERF for community investment projects, and (iii) providing administrative \nsupport for the trustees and other stakeholders for smooth operation of the RERF. All the \n ", "60  Appendix 10 \nSecretariat staff will be recruited in the open market for a fixed term that can be extended for a \nfurther fixed term. The  total annual expenditure for management and administration of the \nRERF will not exceed 5% of the amounts credited to the RERF account.  \n \n6.  The capital of the RERF will be provided by the Government. The Government will \ncontribute proceeds of the RFSDP program loan equivalent to $10 million to enhance the RERF \ncapital.  RFSDP  contribution  to  RERF  will  be  invested  by  the  Government  in  approved \ngovernment securities to avoid any speculative investments and to ensure due and careful \nconsideration of project applications. The interest revenue generated will be transferred into a \ndesignated income account with the Trust to be expensed out to meet the objectives of the \nRERF. The Secretariat will manage the income accounts. All payments will be based on \ninvoices and credited to the account of service providers after documentary evidence that the \ninvestment has been completed to the satisfaction of the community. RERF investments for \ncommunities will be grants for community development and social intermediation. However, \nrecipient communities are required to contribute at least 10% of the total investment amount, \nprimarily in kind such as material or labor contribution, or in cash whenever appropriate, \nespecially when projects require relatively high capital inputs. \n \nD.  Operations  \n \n7.  Given the need for investment in rural communities and the relatively limited resources \navailable, investments funded by the RERF must be carefully selected to ensure they have \ngreater potential to benefit a large proportion of the households in the community. The proposed \ncommunity investment projects should meet the objectives of (i) increasing the access of poor \ncommunities of disadvantaged areas to basic infrastructure facilities; (ii) enhancing efficiency \nand productivity of the local resource pool; (iii) creating income-earning opportunities for the \npoor households; and (iv) empowering the poor, especially women.  \n \n8.  RERF grant funding for rural community investment projects using RFSDP resources will \nbe limited to $3,000 equivalent, to ensure that resources are channeled to small and medium-\nscale  projects  for  meeting  the  immediate  needs  of  the  rural  poor.  Requests  for  funding \nexceeding $3,000 can be approved by the trustees on review of justification up to a maximum of \n$5,000  per  project.  For  projects  above  this  ceiling,  resources  from  other  sources  can \nsupplement RERF funding and community contribution. \n \n9.  For investments funded by RERF, communities will be the primary entities to identify \ntheir needs, priorities, and required interventions. Communities will develop their projects with \nassistance from service providers and enter into partnership agreement with the RERF Trust \nspecifying detailed project design, budget, financing plan including community contribution, and \noperation and maintenance arrangements. RERF funding will be based on project proposals \nprepared by communities including a feasibility report, village profile, and initial environmental \nassessment. Upon review and approval by the trustees, the communities will open a bank \naccount to be operated by the community representatives including one woman, to receive the \nRERF grant installments and to expense out the project-related expenses.  \n \n10.  It is expected that RERF resources will fund 850 community projects by end-2007, and \nthereafter 275 per year.

Linkage to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in  Sector identified as a national priority in Country \nCountry Poverty Analysis?

YES \n   \nIn its Framework for Poverty Reduction, the Government  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  medium-term \nof Sri Lanka (Government) addressed its policy to reduce  development goals for Sri Lanka stipulate that a high \npoverty  through:  (i) funding  strategic  infrastructure  priority is accorded to broad-based rural development \ndevelopment and developing a sustainable financial and  through increasing productivity of the poor, developing \nancillary service environment for the private sector to  infrastructure  especially  in  rural  and  remote  areas, \nexpand  opportunities  for  the  poor  to  participate  in  increasing access to financial and business services, and \neconomic  growth;  and  (ii) fostering  pro-poor  providing  a  stable  and  sustainable  macroeconomic \ntransformation in agriculture by using intensified policy  environment. Further, the medium-term goals address \ndialogue to advocate adoption of more market-oriented  conflict-related  poverty  by  providing  rehabilitation  and \npolicies.  reconstruction assistance to the conflict-affected areas \n  targeting employment generation. \nContribution of the sector/sub sector to reduce poverty in Sri Lanka: \n \nIn Sri Lanka, almost 40% of the population is estimated to be either poor or vulnerable to poverty, and roughly 88% of \nthe poor live in rural areas. Farmers with few nonfarm sources of income, cultivating small plots of land, and casual \nworkers account for a large share of the poor. Rural poverty is also due to inequitable access to economic \ninfrastructure, poorly targeted agriculture subsidies, weak land tenure and registration system, and inadequate \nsupport for rural enterprise development. The development of a sustainable rural finance (RF) sector and efficient RF \ninstitutions (RFIs) will help promote rural economic growth and poverty reduction, through (i) increased productivity \nand profitability of rural economic activities through high value crops and improved manufacturing technology; \n(ii) higher employment generation; and (iii) private sector development, especially micro and small enterprises. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis    Improved Governance/Gender & Development  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nDespite a nationwide network of a wide range of RFIs, the supply gap in rural credit is estimated at SLRs10 billion. \nHalf of this relates to rural poor. The Rural Finance Sector Development Program (RFSDP) will aim to effectively \nmeet the demand for RF services emanating from the rural poor and the vulnerable. Thus, the key focus of the \npoverty analysis is (i) poverty assessment and mapping of the poor and vulnerable who are unable to access RF \nservices, (ii) stocktaking of tangible and intangible productive assets of the poor and vulnerable for making effective \nuse of access to RF for income generating activities, and (iii) identifying constraints to enhancing RF outreach. \n \nPoverty in Sri Lanka. The benefits of the economic growth of about 5% over the past 2 decades are not evenly \ndistributed. While the level of consumption poverty in all the provinces exceeds 20%, it is 40% and above in all but \nthe Western Province. In the north and the east, economic activity has been disrupted due to the civil conflict, causing \na decline in the contribution of this region to national gross domestic product from 15% in the 1980s to 4% in 1997. \n \nPoverty and the Civil Conflict. The civil conflict that has lasted for over a decade has resulted in at least 60,000 \ndeaths, injured, and internally displaced people. Physical assets, including homes, schools, shops, vehicles, and \nmachinery have been abandoned and public infrastructure has virtually collapsed. Social services function with great \ndifficulty, and there is limited access to shelter, health, education, water, and sanitation. The conflict caused \nwidespread prevalence of underweight among children, as high as 50%; and physical injury and psychological stress. \nIt is estimated that the conflict has reduced Sri Lanka's economic growth by about 2\u20133% a year.1 \n \nPoverty and the Agriculture Sector. The stagnant agriculture sector and low productivity per capita also lead to \npersistence rural poverty. Agriculture accounts for roughly 40% of the workforce and produces only 18% of GDP. The \nsingle most important impediment to agricultural prosperity is a policy regime that substitutes consultation and \nparticipation in decision making with administrative control. State ownership of some 80% of the land, restriction on \nland allocation, pervasive input and credit subsidies, and frequent changes in agricultural trade policies result in \ninefficient use of resources and restrict access to improved agro-technology, especially seeds and planting materials. \nPaddy farmers and landless laborers employed in the paddy sector comprise a large share of the rural poor. There is \n                                                 \n1 Central Bank of Sri Lanka. 1999. Annual Report. Colombo. \n ", "  Appendix 16  69\nPaddy farmers and landless laborers employed in the paddy sector comprise a large share of the rural poor. There is \nconsiderable evidence to show that returns to labor, land, and management in paddy cultivation have been \ndecreasing in real terms since the mid-1980s. Parallel development of the rural nonfarm sector is necessary for \nabsorbing the surplus labor from agriculture, thereby relieving pressure on agricultural holdings. \n \nRural Poverty and the Policy. The Government initiated various welfare programs such as the Samurdhi Program, \nwhich combines income transfers, small-scale capital projects, and development of savings and credit societies. The \ngovernment welfare programs, however, ineffectively targeted relief payments and various kinds of subsidies, and \nallowed the farmers only a limited title to the government land. The current welfare programs of the Government are \nunsustainable, subject to political interference, and encourage dependence. Poor payment records among most RFIs \nare the result of ill-conceived development programs and political interventions. There is a growing consensus that \nrural poverty would be reduced more rapidly by replacing welfare-oriented policies with policies conducive to \nstructural changes and the encouragement of market forces. \n \nRural Poverty and the Nonfarm Subsector. Many rural households among the lower poor are unable to benefit \nfrom RF because they cannot bear the risk of failure of their micro enterprises. People at this income level will derive \nthe greatest benefit from the rural sector growth that increases farm and nonfarm employment opportunities. In Sri \nLanka rural people with land do not have secure title, and most landholdings are nontradable. This places the poor at \na disadvantage in accessing rural credit for expansion and diversification of their livelihoods. There is a clear need for \nan accelerated land reform, and for alternatives to collateral-based lending. Commercial banks are seen as \ninaccessible or unresponsive to the needs of small and micro rural enterprises, especially for small agriculture-based \nenterprises, when compared to RFIs, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), government-sponsored rural credit \nprograms, or community-based organizations or informal sources such as moneylenders and pawnbrokers. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis prepared                   YES  Participation Strategy            YES \nStakeholder Analysis. RFSDP will involve participation of stakeholders at different levels and from different sectors. \nBeing the direct focus, marginal and subsistence farmers, women and the rural poor will be active participants. Rural \nfarm and nonfarm households currently being served by RFIs will continue to have access to RF services and hence \nremain active participants. The restructuring of RFIs (Cooperative Rural Banks, Regional Development Banks, \nSamurdhi Banking Societies, and National Development Trust Fund) will further extend their outreach covering \nadditional rural poor in remote areas as well as the poorest who have been unable to access RF from commercial \nbanks and other institutional sources. The proposed Rural Finance Sector Development Act for regulation of RFIs will \nensure secured financial services and deposit protection. At the Government level, Ministry of Policy Development \nand Implementation, Ministry of Rural Economy, Ministry of Co-operatives, Ministry of Samurdhi and the Central Bank \nof Sri Lanka will be involved in RFSDP implementation. In addition, the proposed policy and investment options \ninclude a special support package for extension of RF services in the north and the east, hence requiring participation \nby various Ministries, funding-agencies, NGOs, and civil society. Through RFI restructuring and outreach expansion \nthrough rural enterprise development, significant private sector participation and development are expected. Also, \nextension of the formal credit services to rural areas will curb usury practices. NGOs and civil society will be active \nparticipants in planning and implementation of the Rural Economy Resuscitation Fund (RERF). Social intermediation \nthrough RERF will enhance the capacity of the poor to effectively utilize the increased access to RF services.   \n \nParticipation Strategy. During implementation, the proposed policy and investment interventions will follow an \nintegrated participatory approach. Involvement of stakeholders from various levels and sectors will ensure that the \napproach is adhered to through methods such as participatory stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions, and \nrapid appraisal. The social assessment will emphasize participatory process of direct beneficiaries and lower-end RF \nservice providers to assess their needs and formulate effective outreach mechanisms and identify monitoring and \nevaluation indicators. The assessments will also involve consultations with (i) women groups to identify gender \nrelated issues, (ii) the poorest and vulnerable such as female-headed households to assess their special needs, and \n(iii) households in geographically remote areas where rural poverty is most acute. Monitoring and evaluation will be \ncarried out in a participatory manner with a set of indicators measurable by beneficiaries and stakeholders. \n \nD.  Gender and Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  The social analysis includes gender analysis to identify issues and \nconstraints for women to take and utilize RF services. A strategy of social intermediation will be prepared to assess \ntraining and skill development needs for women. \n \n ", "70   Appendix 16 \nGender plan prepared?  Yes. (Refer section F.
