The Government of the Republic of the Philippines requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide advisory technical assistance (TA)1  for improved national government \ndebt and risk management (DRM).  The TA is included in the approved 2005\u20132007 country \nstrategy and program 2(CSP) for the Philippines. Fact-finding was conducted intermittently from \n1 June to 12 August 2005, after which a memorandum of understanding regarding the objective, \nscope, cost estimates, financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA was signed by \nADB and the Government.  The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  As of end\u20132003 the total stock of public sector debt and quantified national Government \n(NG) contingent liabilities of the Philippines reached P5.8 trillion, the equivalent of 137.5% of \nGross Domestic Product (GDP).  This figure included NG debt (73.2% of GDP), debt of the 14 \nmonitored Government\u2013owned and \u2013controlled corporations (GOCCs, 29.8% of GDP), debt of \nGovernment financial institutions and social security institutions (GFIs and SSIs, 17.2%), and \ncontingent liabilities3 (17.3% of GDP).    Over 5 years from 1998 to 2003, most of these debt \nstocks increased sharply.  Consolidated general government debt more than doubled, from P1.5 \ntrillion in 1998 to P3.1 trillion in 2003.  GOCC debt grew by 137%, from P699 billion in 1998 to \nP1.66 trillion in 2003.  Over the same period GFI debt rose by 49.7% and contingent liabilities \nby 134.5%.  Preliminary 2004 data indicate that NG debt continued to grow.  \n \n3.  In 2004, 37% of total government revenue had to be set aside for interest payments on \nNG debt, preempting investment and important social expenditures. The large fiscal burden of \ndebt servicing, advances on guaranteed loans, and payment of guaranteed obligations under \nprivate  sector  participation  (PSP)  contracts  has  squeezed  out  spending  on  essential \ngovernment services and weakened investor confidence in the macroeconomic stability of the \ncountry.  For these reasons, the new ADB Philippines CSP emphasizes fiscal consolidation as \nthe highest priority goal of ADB support.    \n \n4.  The size of the stock of debt and contingent liabilities makes prudent DRM an essential \ncomponent of any successful fiscal consolidation strategy for the Government. Considerable \nprogress has been made in debt management in recent years, particularly in lengthening the \naverage maturity of NG debt and in maintaining a diverse portfolio of NG obligations. However, \nthis progress needs to be extended and expanded to further reduce the vulnerability of the \nbudget and the economy to fluctuations, and to provide the Government with essential budget \nmanagement tools to better maintain social and development expenditures.  The growing stock \nof debt outside of the NG\u2019s own borrowing program, such as GOCC and GFI debt, and the \nchallenging issues in accurately quantifying and assessing the level of contingent liabilities, \npose the most serious risks. \n \n5.   Contingent  liabilities  expose  the  government  to  the  possibility  of  unexpected  and \nsubstantial obligations over a short period of time and could lead to a severe strain on its fiscal \nresources. Governments, however, seldom recognize the potential impact of these contingent \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 13 July 2005.  \n2 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2005-2007): Philippines. Manila. \n3 This figure includes GOCC loans directly guaranteed by the Government, Government financial institutions \nguarantees assumed by the national Government, and guaranteed corporate issues. It does not include contingent \nliabilities related to build-operate-transfer or other private sector participation agreements, or unfunded pension \nliabilities. \n ", "2     \nliabilities. Since guarantees come due only if triggered by a particular event and in the short run \nhave no immediate cost to the government, such contingent liabilities seldom appear in the \ngovernment\u2019s books. Provisioning for such contingencies is not reflected in the budget and there \nare no clear mechanisms to cover them in case such guarantees are called.  The impact of an \nunexpected fiscal strain due to the realization of sizable unprovisioned contingent liabilities \ncould worsen fiscal and macroeconomic vulnerabilities.   \n \n6.  At present a number of Government agencies are involved in distinct aspects of debt \nmonitoring and approval.  Under the 1987 Administrative Code, the Department of Finance \n(DOF)  is  responsible  for  \u201creview,  approval  and  management  of  all  public  sector  debt\u2026[to \nensure] that all borrowed funds are effectively utilized and all such obligations are promptly \nserviced by the government.\u201d The Code further specifies that DOF will \u201cundertake and supervise \nactivities related to the negotiation, servicing and restructuring of domestic and foreign debt \nincurred or guaranteed by the government and its instrumentalities, including taking part in \nactivities which affect the country\u2019s capacity to service foreign debt.\u201d  Within DOF, the Bureau of \nTreasury (BTr), Domestic Finance Group, International Finance Group (IFG), Corporate Affairs \nGroup (CAG), and Bureau of Local Government Finance (BLGF) are responsible for aspects of \ndebt management.   \n \n7.  BTr plays an important role through participation in programming, structuring, and timing \nof  borrowing  proposals  in  coordination  with  the  Bangko  Sentral  ng  Pilipinas  (BSP)  and \nDepartment  of  Budget  Management  (DBM),  management  of  the  borrowed  funds;  and \nmonitoring of data on availments, repayments, and status of the public debt.   However, BTr\u2019s \ncontribution to debt management is limited since its responsibilities do not extend to other \ngovernment debt obligations, such as GOCC and GFI debts.  CAG is in charge of collecting \ninformation on debt positions of monitored GOCCs, GFIs, and SSIs.  CAG\u2019s work is also \nimpeded by gaps in its mandate.  For example, the nature and degree of DOF\u2019s oversight \nfunctions over the financial operations of GOCCs, GFIs, and SSIs have not been sufficiently \ndefined.  In addition, information on contingent and off-book liabilities pertaining to GOCCs, \nother than those covered by direct NG guarantee, is not sufficient and not effectively monitored \nby the government.  IFG processes all foreign borrowings, while BLGF has a mandate to \nmonitor  all  local  government  unit  (LGU)  borrowing,  provide  inputs  regarding  LGU \ncreditworthiness into the BSP approval process for LGU borrowing from commercial banks, and \nprovide technical assistance to LGUs in matters related to credit financing of budget activities.   \n \n8.  Outside of DOF, other key agencies involved in debt management are BSP, National \nEconomic Development Authority (NEDA), and DBM.  A number of inter ministerial task forces \nhave  been  established  to  deal  with  issues  related  to  government  borrowing.  One  is  the \nDevelopment Budget Coordinating Council,4 which formulates the annual national borrowing \nprogram as a component of the national fiscal program.  However, coordination among the \nvarious agencies involved in DRM often is not effective, and the capacity to develop and \nexecute a comprehensive public sector borrowing strategy is therefore not present.   Further \nserious  gaps  are  (i)  the  lack  of  systematic  tracking  of  contingent  liabilities  arising  from \nguarantees  on  build-operate-transfer  (BOT)  and  other  private  sector  participation  (PSP) \nprojects, unfunded pension liabilities, and fiduciary guarantees issued by government guarantee \n                                                 \n4  The Development Budget Coordinating Council has representatives from the Department of Budget Management \n(chair), DOF, BSP, NEDA and Office of the President. ", "       3 \nagencies;5 (ii) the existence of separate tracking systems for official NG debt and GOCC/GFI \ndebt; and (iii) the lack of mechanisms to produce data on GOCC/GFI debt on a timely basis. \n \n9.  Hence, no single agency has overall responsibility for monitoring and analyzing the \nGovernment\u2019s  debt  exposure  and  risk  profile.  There  is  a  need  to  institutionalize  a  DRM \nframework for the national Government, and to establish a mechanism for formulating and \nexecuting the government\u2019s DRM strategy. The framework and strategy must be comprehensive \nand cover NG debt, GOCC/GFI/SSI debt, and the full spectrum of contingent liabilities. To \nachieve its goals, this framework should include the clarification of data reporting and monitoring \nresponsibilities,  creation  of  an  overall  risk  analysis  function  in  one  central  location,  and \nestablishment of effective, clear and appropriate processes to control the issuance of any new \ngovernment debt obligations and agreements that create new contingent liabilities. A structure \nand the capacity for continuous debt risk assessment should be developed to analyze domestic \nand  international  economic  developments\u2013\u2013exchange  rates,  interest  rates,  and  commodity \nprices\u2013\u2013and incorporating the most current analysis of the full stock of contingent liabilities.  \nWork on GOCC debt and contingent liabilities will build on and be closely coordinated with the \nefforts of the proposed ADB TA on GOCC Reform,6 which aims to improve GOCC financial \nperformance and strengthen NG financial monitoring and oversight over GOCC operations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  DOF has requested ADB TA with improving its DRM function, to establish a process for \na more effective monitoring and coordination of DRM activities.  The aim of the TA is to support \nthe  Government\u2019s  fiscal  consolidation  program  in  the  face  of  large  debt  obligations  and \ncontingent liabilities.  The purpose of the TA is to establish an effective, comprehensive DRM \ninstitutional process, consistent with international best practices and following the guidelines \nprepared by the International Monetary Fund.7  The process will allow the Government to \nidentify, evaluate, quantify, and provide appropriate budget cover for the NG\u2019s debt obligations \nand risk exposure from contingent liabilities.   \n \nB.     Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.   The TA will have two components. \n \n1.  Analytical Work on DRM Issues \n \n12.  This component will include the following tasks:  \n  \n(i)  Outline  of  DOF  options  in  determining  DRM  objectives,  and  preferred  risk \ntolerance and strategies to manage debt and contingent liabilities in the public \nsector. \n \n(ii)  Analysis of the current public sector debt profile and trends. \n                                                 \n5  These include the Home Guaranty Corporation, Trade and Investment Development Corporation, and the Quedan \nand Rural Credit Guarantee Corporation. \n6  Technical  Assistance  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  Government-Owned-and-Controlled-Corporations \nReform, Manila, 2005 (proposed, December, 2005). \n7 IMF and World Bank. 2003. Guidelines for Public Debt Management\u2013Amended. Washington, DC (December). \n ", "4     \n \n(iii)  Analysis of the profile of all Government contingent liabilities, including those \narising from contracts with independent power producers, BOT agreements, and \na  review  of  the  fiduciary  guarantee  mechanism  provided  by  the  national \nGovernment to guarantee institutions. \n \n(iv)  Analysis of current mechanisms for assessing proposals for GOCC and GFI \nprojects that will entail direct or contingent obligations of the Government, and \nrecommendations for improving those mechanisms. \n \n(v)  Review of  existing studies of Government pension obligations and projected \nfinancial conditions, particularly for the Government Service Insurance System  \n(GSIS)  and  Social  Security  System  (SSS),  and,  if  necessary  preparation  of \nadditional  analysis  and  recommendations  concerning  the  incorporation  of \nunfunded pension liabilities in government DRM. \n \n2.  Support for a Strengthened DRM Function  \n \n13.  This component will include the following activities: \n \n(i)  Design of the DRM database, as well as a debt and contingent liability monitoring \nmechanism. \n \n(ii)  Design of a risk management system to identify, quantify, monitor, and manage \ngovernment\u2019s debt and CL portfolio, including the development of appropriate \nbenchmarks, limits, or indicators.  Contingent liabilities tracked by this system are \nto include guarantees issued to BOT/PSP contracts and guarantees issued to \nGOCC loans.  \n \n(iii)  Capacity development for all core agencies and offices engaged in DRM work, \nincluding CAG, IFG, and BTr in DOF, NEDA, and related institutions. \n \n(iv)  Preparation of a report analyzing the current DRM function of the Government, \nand presenting options for strengthening and restructuring it. \n \n(v)  Support for implementing the new DRM function. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,030,000 equivalent, comprising $500,000 in \nforeign exchange and $530,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to provide $720,000 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost as well as $220,000 of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will finance local currency costs of $310,000 equivalent by providing office space, \nstaff support, and other items. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n15.  DOF will be the Executing Agency.   A steering committee comprising representatives \nfrom DOF-CAG, DOF-IFG, DOF-BTr, DOF-BLGF, BSP, and NEDA will be established before \nthe consultants start work, and will meet quarterly to review progress.   The Implementing ", "       5 \nAgency will be DOF-CAG.  DOF will designate an official of at least director rank as the project \nmanager.  Monthly meetings to review progress will be held between the DOF project manager, \nother DOF staff, and the consultants.   \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from March 2006 to February 2007. Policy \ndialogue and consultation will be carried out with public institutions, the private sector, and other \naid agencies. \n \n17.  The TA will require about 12 person-months of international and 38 person-months of \ndomestic consultants with expertise in government debt and credit management, government-\nowned  enterprise  finance,  public  finance  economics,  fiscal  policy,  national  government \naccounting, and public administration law. The TA consultants will be engaged through a firm \nand recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. In light of the highly specialized nature of many of the assignments, and the \nimportance of formulating the best possible risk management system for a country with as much \nexposure as the Philippines, quality-based selection of consultants is recommended.  The \noutline  terms  of  reference  are  attached  as  Appendix  3.    Equipment  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n18.  Within  1  month  of  the  consultants\u2019  fielding,  an  inception  report  will  be  submitted, \npresenting initial findings. Within 3 months of fielding, an updated report presenting preliminary \nfindings, a set of options for strengthening DRM work, and an action plan for TA implementation \nwill be submitted to the project steering committee for guidance on options to develop more fully \nand endorsement of the action plan.  A detailed report on options for strengthened DRM will be \nsubmitted at the end of month 5. A draft final report will be submitted to the committee and ADB \nno later than the end of month 13, and the final TA report will be submitted within 2 weeks of the \nconclusion of the consulting services.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $720,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for the Debt and Risk Management Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms \n       \nImpact       \n  Consolidated public sector  DOF budget reports \nFiscal consolidation effort  deficit\u2013GDP ratio \nsupported by sounder   \nmanagement of risk  Government expenditures on \nexposure in government  debt servicing, guarantees, \ndebt obligations and in  and other liabilities are no \ncontingent liabilities  more than 5% higher than \nbudgeted amounts in any year. \n \n \n       \nOutcome       \n       \n       \nImproved and more  Comprehensive DRM  Staff discussions with  Risks \ncomprehensive  database is functioning.
