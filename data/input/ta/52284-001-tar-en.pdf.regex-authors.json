INTRODUCTION\n1. This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help facilitate procurement and\nproject  management  capacity  by  providing  hands-on  support  to  the  executing  agencies,\nimplementing agencies, and project implementation units (PIUs) in the Central and West Asia\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) that are in key stages of the procurement processes and\ncontract management, project management, and financial management. The support will result\nin improved portfolio quality and reduced setbacks that lead to project implementation delays, and\nwill be accomplished by (i) engaging and deploying international1 and national consultants to\nstrengthen procurement, contract, and project management capacities; (ii) developing studies\nand stocktaking best practices as needed on portfolio management that can be shared and\nreplicated; (iii) providing hands-on support and advice to project teams on financial due diligence\nwork as needed; and (iv) providing capacity development to the executing and implementing\nagencies, primarily in the form of training programs, workshops, and clinics, to increase their\nunderstanding  and  improve  application  of  processes,  policies,  and  guidelines  on  Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  procurement,  contract  management  and  financial  reporting,  and\nauditing.\n2. This TA2 is included in the corporate TA priority list for 2018 with earmarked funding from\nthe Strategy, Policy and Review Department and ties in well with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 operational\npriorities that call for strengthening governance and institutional capacity of DMCs.3 ADB will work\nclosely with DMCs and continue to help the executing and implementing agencies strengthen\ntheir capacity and raise standards in all ADB-funded projects and programs.\nII. ISSUES\n3. Despite ADB\u2019s continued support to DMCs in improving their institutional capacities and\nstrengthening good governance, delays in project implementation because of slow procurement\nand weak governance structures remain a major obstacle to effective project implementation and\nutilization  of  funds.  Project  implementation  delays  in  general,  negatively  affected  portfolio\nperformance in the ADB Central and West Asia Department (CWRD). In 2015, when CWRD\nstarted providing hands-on procurement support and project management capacity development\nand training to the Central and West Asia DMCs, the contract awards ratio was only 18%,\namounting to $1.7 billion, which was below the ADB average of 23%.\n4. Underlying causes of project implementation delays attributable to slow procurement and\nweak implementation capacity point to lack of sufficient understanding within the executing and\nimplementing agencies, and limited skills and experience in handling procurement processes and\nprocedures and complex contracts. Often, the executing and implementing agencies do not have\nthe capacity to prepare bid documents and bid evaluation reports that are acceptable to ADB and\nwill require additional time to correct or clarify bid documents and bid evaluation reports, which\noften results in considerable delays in procurement processes.\n1  International consultants with specific expertise in the application of Asian Development Bank (ADB) procurement, \ncontract management, and financial audit in groups of countries within the Central and West Asia Department. \n2  ADB will finance and administer the TA and will include no DMC government activities, financing, or counterpart \nsupport. ADB will issue a no-objection letter informing DMCs of the proposed TA activities prior to implementation. \nThe TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 November 2018.  \n3  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. ", "2 \n5. Some  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and/or  PIUs  have  limited  project  and\nmanagement skills to manage projects and/or handle complex contracts. The TA for Improving\nthe Capacity and Integrity of Procurement Processes in Central and West Asia, which primarily\nprovides  procurement  and  contract  management  support to  CWRD  DMCs,  highlighted the\nincreased demand for contract and project management hands-on support in cases where some\nexecuting and implementing agencies lacked project management capacities.4 In particular,\nproviding support to the executing and implementing agencies where they lack capacities in\nimplementing contracts, interpreting the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC)\nclauses because of their limited understanding of the FIDIC rules, and in handling contract\ndisputes. Most PIUs, whether subsumed or in parallel with the staff under the government\u2019s line\nministries, also lack the necessary project management skills and experience to carry out efficient\nproject implementation.\n6. Issues of audit report submission timeliness reflect the lack of financial reporting skills or\ncapacity of the executing and implementing agencies, delayed preparation and submission of\nproject financial statements for audit, and delayed contracting of external audit services. Poor\nquality  audit  reports  could  be  attributed  to  the  lack  of  capacity  of  auditors  and/or  lack  of\nunderstanding of ADB loan and/or grant procedures. ADB requires that audit reports comply with\nthe International Standards on Auditing, the International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions,\nor national equivalents. The auditors\u2019 lack of knowledge and understanding of the International\nStandards on Auditing and International Standards of Supreme Audit Institutions leads to low\ncompliance of audit reports submissions. Whether these limitations are inherent in the executing\nagencies, implementing agencies, PIUs, or the environment where these agencies operate, these\ngaps will persist without proper project management capacity development and training support,\nand appropriate skills.\n7. Selected knowledge products that address the request of the executing and implementing\nagencies to rapidly undertake and finance selected studies on procurement, contract, and project\nmanagement to enable project implementation to continue with minimal disruption are needed.\nThe executing and implementing agencies expressed their need to undertake procurement\nmarket assessments and roadshows, and to support PIUs in their monitoring and evaluation\nsystems and quarterly reports to better measure the results of the projects. The TA will develop\non-demand studies on (i) abnormally low bids, (ii) good practices for PIU structures that can help\nthe governments to decide how to optimize the set-up of their PIUs, and (iii) audit models or\nstrategies for international financial institutions that can guide the governments. These models\nmay, as needed, include prequalification exercises for audit firms who can undertake audit for\nADB-funded projects in the region.\n8. Lessons learned include the need to mobilize consultants quickly to ensure that emerging\nproject implementation problems can be addressed swiftly. This is not always possible when using\nloan- or grant-financed project budgets, which are often constrained by stringent preapproved\ngovernment procedures. Since contracts are between firms and the DMCs, contract management\nsupport has often not been provided by ADB staff. In-house ADB skills on contract management\nare often not available. An important lesson learned is that procurement support should not be\ndivorced from contract management support, as both are closely linked.\n4  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Improving the Capacity and Integrity of Procurement Processes in Central and \nWest Asia. Manila. ADB approved the TA on 13 June 2014 and it will be about 5 years old upon closing on 31 May \n2019. ", "3 \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n9. The TA is aligned with the following impact: improvements in public expenditure efficiency\nin  Central  and  West  Asia  supported.5 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  portfolio\nperformance in Central and West Asia improved.6\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n10. Output 1: Conduct of procurement in selected projects strengthened. The TA will\nimprove  procurement  results  by  providing  hands-on  support  to  selected  executing  and\nimplementing agencies in key stages of their procurement processes. The TA consultants will\ndevelop practical solutions to identified procurement problems and provide on-the-ground support\nto the executing and implementing agencies in their procurement processes and key procurement\nactions.  This  will  facilitate  efficient  and  transparent  procurement,  which  will  help  reduce\nprocurement turnaround times and the time taken to assess bid evaluation reports. The TA\nconsultants will conduct procurement workshops and clinics and develop studies as needed,\nwhich will be shared with the executing and implementing agencies and interested stakeholders.\n11. Output  2:  Project  and  contract  management  capacity  strengthened.  The  TA\nconsultants  will  provide  contract  management  support  to  the  executing  and  implementing\nagencies, give advice and hands-on assistance in the implementation of contracts and FIDIC\nclauses, and help in mitigating contract management disputes. They will also provide hands-on\nsupport to the PIUs during project implementation, focusing on critical needs and identified\nproblems and providing practical solutions. The TA consultants will conduct project and contract\nmanagement workshops and clinics in response to demands from the executing agencies,\nimplementing agencies, and PIUs.\n12. Output 3: Financial reporting compliance and capacity and financial due diligence\nstrengthened. Upon request, the TA consultants will support the executing and implementing\nagencies in improving their knowledge and skills in preparing financial reports and support them\nin the timely engagement of external audit services to audit project financial statements. The TA\nconsultants will conduct workshops and clinics in response to demands from the executing and\nimplementing agencies. The TA consultants will also review and examine audit strategies in\nselected CWRD DMCs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Financial Management Technical Guidance\nNote on Preparing a Country Audit Strategy.7 Upon request by project teams, the TA consultants\nmay extend support and advice on financial due diligence work during project processing and\nimplementation.\nC. Cost and Financing\n13. The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis from the\nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed\nin Appendix 2.\n5  Defined by TA. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n7  ADB. 2015.

There  will  be  no  government  counterpart  support  for  this  TA,  which  will  be  fully\nadministered and financed by ADB.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n15. ADB will administer the TA. The Portfolio, Results, Safeguards and Gender Unit in ADB\u2019s\nCWRD (CWOD-PSG) will implement the TA, in coordination with CWRD\u2019s resident missions and\nsector divisions. CWOD-PSG will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. In some cases,\nrelevant  resident  missions  and  sector  divisions  will,  upon  approval  from  CWOD-PSG,  be\nresponsible for recruiting, supervising, and evaluating consultants. The resident missions will\nprovide country support to TA activities including providing work space for consultants and\nassisting in planning meetings, workshops, and training.\n16.
