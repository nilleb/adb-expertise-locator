INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2020 has identified regional cooperation \nand integration as one of the three development agenda to alleviate poverty in Asia and the \nPacific.1 The South Asia regional cooperation strategy, 2011\u20132015 focuses on the three priority \nareas of transport, energy, and trade facilitation2\u2014with strong country ownership of these areas \nreflected  in  their  endorsement  by  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation \ncountries, which participated in the second regional cooperation and integration high-level forum \non  Emerging  Vision  for  Shared  Prosperity:  South  Asia  and  Beyond  in  August  2010,3 and \nsimilarly asserted by the governments of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal during the \nSouth  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  (SASEC)  energy,  and  transport  and  trade \nfacilitation working group meeting that was held on 20\u201321 October 2011 in Bangkok. Over the \npast decade, ADB has undertaken significant technical assistance and project operations in \nSASEC.  The  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  Program  (RCSP)  2006-2008  supported \nactivities to promote customs reforms, simplify and harmonize rules, standards and procedures, \npromote efficient banking and insurance services, and improve border facilities and transport \ninfrastructure. ADB has financed regional flag-ship studies such as the South Asian Association \nfor Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Regional Multimodal  Transport Study, and the SAARC \nRegional  Energy  Trade  Study. 4  ADB  is  financing  the  Bangladesh-India  Electrical  Grid \nInterconnection Project, and others under the SASEC framework. \n \n2.  In 2010, delegates from the Department for International Development (DFID) discussed \nwith ADB5 the possibility of establishing a grant financing facility to address the long-term goal of \nboth the Government of the United Kingdom and ADB of opening trade and investment flows \namong all countries. In South Asia, a priority of the Government of the United Kingdom is \nlowering trade barriers, including those affecting the poorest countries, to give them greater \naccess  to  global  markets  and  assisting  low-income  countries  in  trade  negotiations.  In  the \nEastern Corridor Business Case prepared by the DFID Asia regional team, reducing the time \nand costs required for goods to cross borders at six key regional posts by 40% on average by \n2016 was specified as one of the five criteria to determine the success of the DFID\u2013ADB \npartnership in engaging with the governments of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal toward \ncross-border trade facilitation in the region.6  \n \n3.  The DFID\u2013ADB partnership to support the South Asia economic integration through this \npartnership cluster technical assistance (TA) is timely.7 The substantial economic benefits from \nfacilitating  trade  and  investment,  the  development  of  transport  and  logistics  corridors,  and \nenergy trading are now better appreciated by the South Asian governments and the private \nsector. Recent political commitment embodied in the signing on 14 January 2010 of a joint \ncommuniqu\u00e9 by the prime ministers of Bangladesh and India has ushered in a new era of \ncooperation.8   \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008.

This paper provides the issues, TA rationale, intended impact and outcomes, method, \nand key activities of the TA, including its administration and other implementation details. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Compared with other regions, South Asia has poor regional trade relations. In South \nAsia, trade openness, as expressed by imports and exports as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct, is about 40%, or only about two-thirds the ratio of 60% in Southeast Asia and East Asia. \nIntraregional trade in South Asia is also much lower, at 5%, compared with 50% for East Asia \nand 30% for Southeast Asia.9 Factoring in South Asia\u2019s geographic proximity, the situation \nreflects the significantly higher cost of trade with major partners outside the region. Intraregional \ntrade  barriers  in  South  Asia  are  particularly  significant  for  economies  with  small  domestic \nmarkets, limited diversification, or poor connections to neighboring countries.10 These barriers \ninclude high transportation costs, poor institutions, inadequate infrastructure, and other high \ntransactions  costs. 11  Other  challenges  include  variable  logistic  efficiency,  cumbersome \nbureaucratic regulations, and companies\u2019 limited technological capacity.12  \n \n6.   Weak infrastructure, particularly for transport and energy, combined with challenges \nregarding logistics, trade, and the regulatory and business environments are binding constraints \non regional growth in South Asia (footnote 3). Improved trade facilitation and logistics could cut \nthe cost of trading by up to 70% within 5 years, doubling intraregional trade to $35 billion \nannually from the present $18 billion (footnote 9) and, at the same time, boosting trade with the \nrest of the world by an additional 30% (footnote 10). This would induce structural transformation, \nwith 80% or more of traded goods no longer being in the low-value-added category, as to up to \n30% of goods traded by 2015 would belong in the category of medium-to-high value added. \nWith the focus on SASEC countries, cross-border capacity for container traffic, cross-border \nfreight, and intraregional investment are expected to increase.  \n \n7.  Economic integration between Bangladesh and India could raise growth in Bangladesh \n(footnote 10), Bhutan, Nepal,13 and eastern parts of India. Bhutan and Nepal are currently \nenhancing power interconnection and trade capacity with India.  \n  \n8.  Intraregional trade can account for 10% of the region\u2019s world trade in 2016 and by 2020 \nthat share could be 15%. Complementary government policies are essential to ensure that firms \nand individuals can overcome challenges and take advantage of new opportunities.

In recent years, demand for regional cooperation and integration activities from ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries has increased, such that financing requirements are greater than \nthe funds currently available. ADB recognizes that it can provide only part of the resources \nneeded  and,  as  mandated  in  Strategy  2020,  is  looking  to  partnerships  with  international \ndevelopment  agencies,  multilateral  and  bilateral  institutions,  the  private  sector,  and  other \norganizations to play bigger roles in planning, financing, and implementing ADB operations. \n \n10.  While several multidonor trust funds and trade assistance programs14 support work on a \nrange  of  trade  issues,  huge  unmet  demand  remains  for  project-oriented  trade  facilitation \ninitiatives in South Asia. Governments are keen to have additional resources, and ADB and \nDFID can help mobilize and leverage additional resources for activities such as (i) prefeasibility \nstudies for future regional investment and (ii) related institutional capacity building. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA will assist in poverty reduction in the least-developed areas of South Asia by \nfacilitating  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  With  a  special  focus  on  least-developed \ncountries in South Asia, the TA will help the SASEC countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, \nand Nepal become a more integrated market for goods and services. The outcome will be \nenhanced capacity and operational efficiency in trade, including energy trade and cross-border \ninvestment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  Cluster approach. A cluster approach to processing subprojects is proposed to ensure \nthe sustainability of economic integration activities as detailed in this paper, within an agreed \noverall framework while providing enough flexibility to effectively respond to the needs of the \nclient countries. The cluster approach enables governments to confirm their ownership and \ncontinued political commitment for the effective implementation and speedy delivery of the \nproposed TA subprojects and investments. A built-in mechanism of phasing subprojects will \nallow subsequent subprojects to be fine-tuned to the outcomes of the earlier subprojects and \nthe evolving context of country initiatives toward facilitating trade and investment.  \n \n13.  The subprojects to be financed under the TA will address one or more of four priority \nareas for economic integration in South Asia: (i) pre-feasibility work for trade-related cross-\nborder infrastructure, transport logistics, and related software; (ii) energy trade and institutional \ncapacity building; (iii) trade facilitation15 including customs modernization and harmonization; \nand (iv) other regional public goods that directly enhance economic integration in connection \nwith trade in goods, services, and energy (e.g., strengthening financial systems, coordinating \nmacroeconomic policies, addressing climate change vulnerabilities through energy trade, and \n                                                 \n14 Includes the World Bank\u2019s Trade Facilitation Facility, Multi-Donor Trust Fund for Trade and Development, and \nBank Netherlands Partnership Program Trade Window; and ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund \nunder  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility.  \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/Cofinancing/RegionalCooperation-and-IntegrationFinancing.pdf \n15 D.H.

Developing capacity and involving the private sector \nwill be imbedded in subproject design. \n \n14.  The cluster will comprise subprojects submitted in three successive batches in line with \nthe vision of the South Asia regional cooperation strategy, 2011\u20132015 and consistent with the \ninvestment and assistance program identified for these countries. Selected subprojects will be \napproved within the agreed amount and timing of DFID financing. The first batch of subprojects \nfor  $2.74  million  equivalent  will  be  approved  and  implemented  from  2012  to  2013.  The \nsucceeding subprojects are expected to be approved not later than 2014 to ensure completion \nby  2016.  A  consolidated  completion  report  will  be  prepared  for  the  TA  cluster.  Because \nsubproject approval, disbursements, impacts, and outcomes are time-bound, caution will be \nused in any claims of longer-term impact and outcome, especially for the second and third \nbatches of subprojects. \n \n15.  Country coverage. Countries eligible for financing are Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. \nAs geography dictates that India provide overland transit for Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan \nand maritime transit for Nepal and Bhutan (footnote 10), resources used to facilitate trade must \ninclude India to enable these three countries to fully achieve the expected results.  \n \n16.  First batch of subprojects. Six subprojects for implementation in 2012 and 2013 were \nselected from a list of priority subprojects previously identified and carefully reviewed and \ndiscussed with the governments in 2011 in SASEC energy and trade facilitation working groups. \nAppendix 2 summarizes the first batch of subprojects, and Appendix 3 gives consultants\u2019 initial \noutline terms of reference. The early identification and approval of the first batch of subprojects \nin line with ADB guidelines allows the efficient disbursement of funds for priority subproject \nimplementation.  \n \n17.  Types of outputs. Proposals will be reviewed and recommendations for funding for the \nsecond and third batches of subprojects will be made by an advisory panel to be formed under \nthe TA. The four major outputs will be as follows (Appendix 1): \n(i)  Pilot or innovative interventions and reforms. The proposed subprojects will \naddress binding constraints on regional cooperation and integration in South \nAsia with solutions that fit the domestic situation in the participating country and \nhave potential for successful replication, mainstreaming, and/or scaling up in \nother countries.  \n(ii)  Prefeasibility studies and technical work. This will include activities to identify \nand analyze design options and other technical studies for future investment \nprojects. \n(iii)  Capacity building. This will include building the capacity of institutions, providing \nexpert advice to support the implementation of regulatory and policy reforms, and \ndeveloping management systems and operational procedures. \n(iv)  Information  dissemination.  This  will  include  awareness  campaigns, \nconferences  and  workshops,  the  publication  of  lessons  learned,  and  other \nmethods of communication and information dissemination that highlight practical \nsuccess stories, including DFID\u2019s and ADB\u2019s economic integration initiatives.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The cluster TA is estimated to cost $5 million equivalent (about \u00a33.12 million). The TA \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom and administered \n ", "5 \n \nby ADB.16 The grant will be made available to ADB in installments from 2012 to 2015.17 The \ntotal financing requirement for each subproject should normally not exceed $500,000,18 and \nsubprojects should focus on one or more of the four key priority areas and types of outputs \n(Appendix 4). \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The  TA,  which  will  be  untied  and  administered  by  ADB,  will  be  implemented  over \n4 years, starting from the signing of the memorandum of understanding, expected to take place \nin April/May 2012. ADB will impose a service charge in accordance with ADB policy on service \ncharges  for  administering  grant  cofinancing  from  bilateral  sources.19 A  secretariat  will  be \nestablished within the South Asia Department and will be headed by the director of the South \nAsia  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division.  The  Secretariat  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the TA, including the utilization of funds. ADB \nmay use part of the facility (and any income and interest thereon) to cover the activities of the \nSecretariat.20 See Appendix 2 for implementation details. \n \n20.  Most activities under the TA will be carried out by international and national individual \nconsultants or, if more appropriate, consulting firms with strong experience in trade facilitation \nand regional cooperation and integration in the areas of energy and transport. Consultants will \nbe engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).21 Equipment and materials to be financed by the TA will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom for the South Asia Economic Integration Partnership.  \n                                                 \n16 The Government of the United Kingdom has confirmed through DFID its intention to support the partnership \nthrough a memorandum of understanding. \n17 The Government of the United Kingdom will remit $1.25 million upon signing the memorandum of understanding on \nchannel financing establishing the South Asia Economic Integration Partnership TA, with future installments \namounting to $1.25 million per annum. \n18 In special cases, proposals greater than $500,000 but not more than $900,000 that have advisory panel approval \nmay be considered. \n19 ADB. 2000.
