THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed policy-\nbased grant, and (ii) a proposed project grant, both to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Skills for Inclusive \nGrowth Sector Development Program.1 \n \n2.  The  policy-based  grant  will  support  key  policy  reforms  to  strengthen  technical  and \nvocational education and training (TVET) in the Kyrgyz Republic. The proposed project grant will \nfinance investments that directly link to and support the effective delivery of those reforms. \nComplementary policy-based and project components will strengthen TVET governance and \nfinance, improve teaching quality and learning environments, and increase cooperation with \nindustry and develop entrepreneurship skills.2  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Country development strategy and constraints. The Kyrgyz Republic is one of the \npoorest economies in Central Asia. The country had a per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of \n$1,133 in 2015, and an estimated 32% of the population lives below the poverty line. A diagnostic \nstudy financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has identified a shortage of skilled labor as \none of the four major binding constraints to inclusive economic growth.3 The National Sustainable \nDevelopment Strategy 2013\u20132017, and the upcoming strategy being prepared by the Government \nof the Kyrgyz Republic, place a high importance on skills development as an integral part of \neconomic development. \n \n4.  Economic development in the Kyrgyz Republic has been concentrated in Bishkek and \nsurrounding areas, with fewer economic growth opportunities in other regions. The government\u2019s \nnew regional policy addresses regional disparities by promoting region-specific development \npaths;4 it stresses the importance of effectively developing and using human resources to meet \neach regions\u2019 economic priorities, and seeks to achieve this by modernizing professional education \nand developing applied qualifications. The national education strategy acknowledges that the \nTVET system does not meet the requirements for adequate skills training. The long-term strategy \nfor education under preparation by the Ministry of Education and Science (MOES) will address this \nshortfall and pursue comprehensive TVET reform, and its alignment with key national and regional \neconomic priorities.5 \n \n5.  Challenges facing skills development. Government education spending equaled 5.6% \nof GDP in 2015, is projected to be 5.7% in 2017, and to remain at about 5.3% for 2017\u20132019,6 \nabove the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) average of 5.2%. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance: ADB. Kyrgyz Republic. Skilling \nand Entrepreneurship for Inclusive Growth Sector Development Program (TA 9212-KGZ, for $750,000, approved 22 \nOctober 2016). \n3  ADB. 2014. The Kyrgyz Republic Strategic Assessment of the Economy. Manila. \n4  Key sectors named in the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2013\u20132017 include: agriculture and food \nprocessing, energy, transport, information and communication technology, tourism and services, and manufacturing \nand logistics. The new regional economic policy stresses construction, medicine, and education as regional and \nadditional priorities. Regional Policy of the Kyrgyz Republic 2018\u20132022, approved by Government Resolution #194, \n31 March 2017. http://www.gov.kg/?p=92280&lang=ru. \n5   Ministry of Education and Science. 2011. Education Development Strategy of the Kyrgyz Republic 2012-2020. \nBishkek. \n6  Analysis of Education Finance in the Kyrgyz Republic (study conducted in 2017 by ADB. Kyrgyz Republic. \nStrengthening Education System Development Program).  \n ", "2 \nSince  2000,  the  average  expenditure  on  education  as  a  percentage  of  total  government \nexpenditure has remained considerably above the OECD average of 11.3%,7 and is projected to \nbe 18.6% for 2017. In 2015\u20132017, total expenditure on education grew by 16%, while the growth \nrate of expenditure on TVET was only 10%. Challenges remain in improving the quality and \nrelevance of skills in response to labor market demand. Inadequate education of the workforce \nwas cited as a major constraint to business development by 33% of the country\u2019s firms, well above \nthe regional average of 22%.8 The proportion of the workforce that is skilled (currently about 20%) \nshould increase, with skills that better meet needs in key economic sectors.9 For example, while \nmost construction activity is in Chui oblast, the oblast has no TVET programs to train construction \nworkers or technicians. In addition, labor force participation among women (currently at 53%) must \nbe increased to make economic growth more inclusive. \n \n6.  Fragmented technical and vocational education and training system. In the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, lyceums provide primary TVET to develop skilled workers, while colleges provide \nsecondary TVET to develop middle-level specialists. Students who wish to enter primary or \nsecondary TVET must complete grade 9. There are no pathways for students between these two \nlevels\u2014thus secondary TVET does not follow on from primary TVET. About one-third of colleges \nproviding secondary TVET are affiliated with higher education institutions. When entering higher \neducation, graduates of these colleges are given credit for their previous education. \n \n7.  Limited youth participation and employability. A recent national study indicates (i) TVET \nparticipation rates are very low (just 10.6% of youth aged 15\u201324 are in TVET, 2.3% in primary \nTVET and 8.3% in secondary TVET); (ii) a large proportion of youth (27.9%) are not in education, \nemployment, or training, and in some regions this proportion exceeds 30%; (iii) among school \ngraduates (grades 9, 10, and 11), 27.9% enroll in TVET, while 21% enter higher education, and \nover 51% enter the labor market or join the pool of those who are not in education, employment, \nor training, and lack any skills training.10 The skills profile of TVET graduates does not correspond \nto regional economic priorities. On average, the skills profile of graduates differs from the sectoral \nprofile of the regional labor forces by 75%. \n \n8.  Insufficient  quality  and  options  for  training.  Only  a  fraction  of  the  many  skilled \noccupations (434) and specializations (243) are taught; the lack of diversity in training programs \nmakes TVET less attractive and skews the gender distribution, with mostly male TVET students in \nlyceums, and female TVET students in colleges.11 While secondary TVET college enrollments \nhave increased significantly,12 teaching in colleges remains highly theoretical, and does not \nadequately equip youth with the practical skills they need in the labor market. Many new teachers \nlack pre-service training, and in-service training opportunities for existing teachers are limited. \nThese weaknesses are reinforced by a shortage of sophisticated training materials and equipment. \n \n                                                \n7  The latest available OECD average (2014) was 11.3%.

Second Vocational Education and Skills Development Project (Grant \n0307-KGZ and Loan 2902-KGZ). \n11 For each 100,000 youth aged 15\u201324, only 16 programs are offered in TVET lyceums and 26 programs in TVET \ncolleges, i.e., overall 42 programs. In 2016, there were 30,492 students (21,340 male and 9,152 female) in primary \nTVET, and 90,585 students (39,506 male and 51,079 female) in secondary TVET. \n12 Since 2000, the number of secondary TVET colleges doubled, while enrollments more than tripled. \n ", "3 \n9.  ADB support. ADB has been a key development partner of MOES since 1996 with three \ncompleted projects, including a first TVET project that ended in 2012. The second TVET project \nwill end in 2018.13 ADB has also provided support to skills training through a component in \nInvestment Climate Improvement Program of the Ministry of Economy. \n \nADB\u2019s Long-term Engagement in Education and Skills Development \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.  The two TVET projects have for the most part supported primary TVET, covering about \n75% of primary TVET lyceums in the country. The projects have focused on improving quality, \nfacilities and equipment, and skills development leading to immediate employment. They have \nhelped  to  introduce  key  elements  of  a  labor-market  focused  TVET  system,  including  \n(i) development of occupational standards through sector skills councils, (ii) competency-based \ntraining, (iii) teachers\u2019 in-service training, and (iv) an innovative skills development fund that helps \nthe private sector purchase skills training. While this assistance has improved primary TVET \nperformance, the conventional project modality has not supported the comprehensive reforms\u2014\nparticularly creation of an enabling policy environment\u2014required if TVET is to meet the country\u2019s \nevolving labor market needs.14 \n \n11.  Sector  development  program  approach. The  proposed  new  program  will  help  the \ngovernment take key reform steps to create a more coherent TVET policy and system, which is \nnecessary to improve the quality, relevance, and efficiency of skills development corresponding \nwith the country\u2019s national and regional economic  priorities. A sector development program \nmodality is proposed to help (i) MOES develop an enabling policy environment for comprehensive \nTVET reform, and (ii) finance the cost of and implement the reforms. The program will build on \nachievements, and represents a logical progression in ADB support by institutionalizing the skills \ndevelopment  fund,  providing  more  extensive  support  to  secondary  TVET,  fostering  closer \ncollaboration between TVET and employers, and introducing entrepreneurship education. \n \n                                                \n13 ADB.

ADB will also support the restructuring of the TVET system, including the potential merger \nof primary and secondary TVET into a system that can respond more effectively to labor market \npriorities and provide effective skills pathways for students. To achieve this, pilots of innovative \ncenters of excellence (COEs) will be supported to (i) link skills training with regional priorities in the \ncountry; (ii) align curricula and create student pathways between primary and secondary TVET; \n(iii)  ensure  close collaboration  with  industry;  and  (iv)  provide  entrepreneurship  development \nmodules to help students pursue self-employment, and help leaders of TVET institutes adopt \nentrepreneurial activities that can increase institutional revenues. The program design reflects \nlessons  from  prior  projects,  including  the  need  for  enabling  policy  reform,  and  reducing \nimplementation delays (these were caused mainly by having many small procurement contracts). \nThe program is integral to the ADB country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for the Kyrgyz \nRepublic; both it and the new strategy under preparation are closely aligned with national priorities, \nincluding an increasing emphasis on skills development.15 \n \n13.  Development coordination. Development partner coordination in education in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic is well established and effective. Development partners formulate and promote joint \npositions on a range of issues. ADB and German development cooperation through Deutsche \nGesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) are key development partners in the TVET \nsector, with GIZ mainly focusing on (i) establishing a system of independent industry assessment, \n(ii) improving the labor market information system, and (iii) matching jobs with job-seekers. The \ncomprehensive reform to be supported by the proposed new ADB-financed program will also serve \nas a framework for MOES to improve donor coordination.16 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The  program  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  government  strategies  to  achieve \ninclusive growth through improved workforce skills and productivity in the country\u2019s key economic \nsectors, specifically the National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017; and Education \nDevelopment Strategy, 2012\u20132020.17 The program will have the following outcome: an established \nmarket-responsive, entrepreneurial, and inclusive TVET system. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The program includes three outputs: (i) TVET governance and finance strengthened,           \n(ii)  teaching  quality  and  learning  environments  improved,  and  (iii)  cooperation  with  industry \nincreased and entrepreneurship skills developed.18 The program includes 10 policy actions for the \nfirst tranche and 16 policy actions for the second tranche. All policy actions for the first tranche \nhave been completed.  \n \n16.  Output 1: Technical and vocational education and training governance and finance \nstrengthened. Output 1 policy actions will enable the government to align skills development \nreform with the National Sustainable Development Strategy, 2013\u20132017; economic and labor \nmarket policy; key industries; and priority occupations; and include development of a national \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2013.

Bishkek. \n18 Details of the policy actions are in the Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) and Policy Matrix (Appendix 4). \n ", "5 \nqualifications system as part of the upcoming national long-term education sector strategy. Policy \nactions will (i) improve TVET governance, increase the number of trainees under the skills \ndevelopment fund from 600 to 5,000, institutionalize the fund, and allow implementation of the \nTVET rationalization plan; and (ii) support development of an integrated education management \ninformation system (EMIS) to (a) promote efficient sector governance, management, quality \nassurance, and monitoring; (b) improve TVET effectiveness by linking to supply and demand \nmodels relevant to Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s regional labor markets; and (c) establish coherent pathways \nand improve transitions for students to progress in TVET and the labor market. \n \n17.  Program activities are closely aligned with the policy targets. Under output 1, the program \nwill  help  facilitate  the  work  of  interministerial  and  regional  working  groups  and  implement \nworkshops in the various development areas. Activities will include studies to help guide the \nalignment of skills development to regional labor market needs, piloting the recognition of prior \nlearning in skills programs, technical support to ensure seamless integration of TVET in the EMIS, \nand tracer studies of graduates to track employment outcomes. \n \n18.  Output 2: Teaching quality and learning environments improved. Output 2 policy \nactions will foster the development of competency-based education standards, and learning \noutcomes-based curricula in TVET. The policy on COEs and work-based learning will help align \ncurricula  and  develop  student  pathways  between  primary  and  secondary  TVET,  increase \nopportunities for students to acquire and demonstrate practical skills, and help students benefit \nfrom on-the-job training. The policy on COEs will allow per capita financing in secondary TVET and \npilot it in COEs. The new policy on teacher development will help ensure coordination and \ncoherence  between  pre-service  training  of  new  teachers  and  in-service  training  of  existing \nteachers, and will help meet TVET pedagogical and technical needs.  \n \n19.  Program activities will support the establishment of up to five COEs and provide capacity \ndevelopment to help them offer training for a total of 4,000 students in occupations that reflect \nregional labor market priorities. Consultative and technical workshops will help the respective \nbusiness associations specify skills training requirements at the COEs, and plan arrangements for \nstudents for work-based learning in companies. Technical support will be provided for (i) reform of \nTVET standards and curricula, and materials for teachers; and (ii) preparation of a training program \nfor new and existing TVET teachers, which will train 1,000 primary TVET and 2,000 secondary \nTVET teachers. \n \n20.  Output  3:  Cooperation  with  industry  increased  and  entrepreneurship  skills \ndeveloped.  Policy  actions  under  this  output  will  enable  (i)  promotion  of  TVET\u2013industry \npartnerships; and (ii) the introduction of entrepreneurship education in secondary TVET, and its \npiloting in COEs. The program will provide technical support to develop entrepreneurship education \nin TVET, train teachers, and prepare materials for teachers and students. Technical support and \nguidance will be provided to COEs for the planning and implementation of partnerships that will \nrespond to labor market priorities and strengthen sustainability of COE operations. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n21.  The government has requested a policy-based grant of $12 million and a project grant of \n$18 million, not exceeding $30 million in total from ADB Special Funds resources to finance the \nprogram. The amounts were determined based on (i) the government\u2019s development expenditures \nand financing needs,19 and (ii) the relative importance given to education sector development in \n                                                \n19 The development-related financing gap is about $320.7 million for 2017, and is expected to remain for several years \n ", "6 \nnational development strategies. The policy-based grant will be disbursed in two tranches upon \nfulfillment of policy actions expected to be accomplished in 2017 (tranche 1, $4.0 million) and 2021 \n(tranche 2, $8.0 million).

Retroactive financing has \nbeen requested to cover the salaries of PIU staff. Retroactive financing in total \nwill not exceed 20% of the project grant amount. \nDisbursement  The project grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.d The $12 \nmillion policy-based grant will be disbursed in two tranches once relevant \npolicy actions have been completed to ADB\u2019s satisfaction by the government: \nTranche 1:  $4.0 million (planned for 2017); \nTranche 2:  $8.0 million (planned for 2021). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MOF = Ministry of Finance, MOECON = Ministry of Economy, MOES = Ministry of \nEducation and Science, MOLSD = Ministry of Labor and Social Development, PIU = project implementation unit. \na  Details are in Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nb  The priority on quality is needed, because the impact of the consultant\u2019s assignment will be significant. \nc  The government has been advised that approval of advance contracting will not commit ADB to subsequently \napproving financing for the project. \nd Grant proceeds will be used to finance the cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in           \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports financed under other sources. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n24.  The program will build on the achievements of the two previous ADB-financed investment \nprojects (footnote 13). The design of the program reflects the lessons stressing the importance of \nstrengthening  sustainability  and  system  efficiency  through  comprehensive  skills  reform, \n ", "8 \nempowered by enabling policy actions and supported by project activities closely aligned with the \npolicy actions. The establishment of pathways for students, the development of competency-based \nstandards and learning outcomes-based curricula, and the increased emphasis on work-based \nlearning are all necessary reform measures to enhance the skills and employability of graduates.20 \nSupport for entrepreneurship education is needed to foster self-employment by graduates, while \ncloser partnerships with industry will help match skills with labor market priorities. The policy \nactions for industry partnerships will support the sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M) of \ntraining facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  The program\u2019s direct economic benefits stem from the benefits to economic growth from \nincreased quality and relevance of skills. Improved skills will also help people access better-paid \njobs and earn higher incomes. The program will help increase the number of skilled workers in the \ncountry, and thus support expansion of key economic sectors. Investments in human capital \nthrough education can lead to per capita GDP growth of up to 1.7% per year. For the Kyrgyz \nRepublic, estimated growth is around 1.6%. Support for comprehensive skills reform is likely to \nincrease the economic growth rate in the long term. \n \n26.  The  program  benefits  are  estimated  over  25  years.21 The  program  is  assessed  as \neconomically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return of 16.1%. The analysis \nincorporates two benefit streams: (i) the employment rate, which is estimated to increase from 70% \nto 91% because of the program; and (ii) an increased wage premium of 3% from the results of \nskills training that is more relevant to labor market needs. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the \neconomic return remains robust under adverse conditions\u2014switching value analysis indicates that \nthe economic internal rate of return will be 11.8% under the following scenario: O&M costs \nincreased by 20%, benefits reduced by 20%, and operation delayed by 1 year. \n27.  The fiscal impact analysis confirms the government has adequate budgetary resources to \nfulfill its financial obligations under the program.22 Total program costs will be significantly less than \n0.5% of total annual government expenditures. The financial sustainability analysis indicates that \nthe  government  has  sufficient  capacity  to  cover  annual  O&M  costs  beyond  the  program \nimplementation period\u2014estimated O&M costs are low (0.019% to 0.022% of total government \nspending). \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  MOES has successfully managed several ADB-funded projects. The program\u2019s financial \nmanagement assessment rates the capacity of MOES as satisfactory and the overall pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk as moderate. The procurement capacity of MOES was assessed, and \nthe pre-mitigation procurement management risk deemed moderate. The risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan will mitigate risks through (i) advance action for early recruitment of consulting \nservices to build capacity in procurement and good governance, (ii) recruitment of qualified staff \n                                                \n20 The program will include tracer studies of graduates. Employability is typically assessed using an index that combines \nresults of tracer studies in occupational fields, technical and social competences, and workplace satisfaction.  \nP.

Risks will further be mitigated by the government\u2019s ongoing \ncentralized electronic procurement system initiative. The ADB Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \namended to date) was explained to, and discussed with, the government and MOES. MOES \nadopted an anticorruption action plan in 2014.23 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n29.  The program will disproportionately benefit the poor and socially disadvantaged groups,24 \nwho will benefit directly from the inclusive approach and quality improvements in COEs; outreach \nto rural areas will be a key strategy to inform them about opportunities to access improved TVET. \nMost COEs will be established in second-tier cities, which will increase access for vulnerable \ngroups. The program\u2019s focus on regional economies will help improve overall well-being in the \nselected regions. The skills development fund will prioritize vulnerable beneficiaries. The program \nis categorized as gender equity.25Key issues to be addressed include (i) stereotypes associated \n \nwith the traditional role of females in society, which cause dropouts in TVET due to early marriage; \nand (ii) cultural barriers that prevent girls from choosing professions with higher pay and demand. \nFemale students currently represent only about one-third of primary TVET students, and most are \nstudying tailoring, services, and catering. Although female students outnumber males in secondary \nTVET, these proportions do not translate to the labor market. About 400 professions are still \nprohibited for female students. The program will seek to increase female participation in priority \ncourses and improve the employability of both male and female graduates. Program support to the \nEMIS will allow collection and analysis of gender-disaggregated data. The program will support \ngender-balanced  management  teams  in  TVET  institutes,  dormitories  for  girls,  gender-\nmainstreamed teaching and learning materials, qualified teachers in nontraditional fields, and a \ngender-sensitive assessment system that allows for gender-disaggregated analysis and feedback. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n30.  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program is classified as \ncategory C for involuntary resettlement, environment, and impact on indigenous peoples. Civil \nworks will be carried out for the rehabilitation of classrooms in lyceums and colleges as part of the \npiloting of COE arrangements. Civil works-related impacts are localized, short-term, and can be \neffectively mitigated through the application of good civil works practices. An environmental \nmanagement checklist will be prepared for use in civil works during program implementation. \nProgram activities will require neither land acquisition nor resettlement, and program activities will \nnot adversely affect indigenous peoples. The improved quality of skills development resulting from \nthe program will benefit all students, including indigenous peoples. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Risks associated with the program are reviewed based on the risk analysis matrix. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.26 \n \n                                                \n23 The specific Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

ASSURANCES \n32.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies\u2014including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement\u2014as described in detail in the project \nadministration manual and grant documents. The government has agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the program, which are set forth in the grant agreements. The policy grant will be \ndisbursed as follows: (i) $4.0 million upon completion of all first tranche policy actions to ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction, and (ii) $8.0 million upon completion of all second tranche policy actions to ADB\u2019s \nsatisfaction. Policy actions for first tranche will be completed prior to ADB Board of Directors \nconsideration of the program on 20 November 2017, and by 2021 for the second tranche. Prior to \nprogram effectiveness, a program steering committee will be established and project director \nappointed.  The  grant  agreements  will  need  to  become  effective  simultaneously  as  the \neffectiveness of policy-based grant agreement is conditional upon the effectiveness of the project \ngrant, and vice versa. \nV.
