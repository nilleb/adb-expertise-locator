The Government of Viet Nam\u2019s strategy for Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is to develop \npublic transport and road infrastructure to improve the quality of urban living and the urban \nenvironment. The People\u2019s Committee sees urban rail mass rapid transit (MRT) as a key pillar \nin its strategy to promote public transport use and restrain the use of private vehicles.  \n2.  The Government has asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a loan to \nconstruct  two  connected  MRT  lines.1 The  project  is  included  in  the  2007\u20132010  country \npartnership strategy prepared between ADB and the Government of Viet Nam. \n3.  In order to clarify the scope and feasibility of the proposed lines, it is proposed that ADB \nprovide project preparatory technical assistance (TA).2 ADB missions3 visited Ho Chi Minh City \nfrom 27 March to 1 April 2006 and 8\u201313 May 2006 to undertake fact-finding for the TA. The \nearlier mission reviewed the updated feasibility study prepared for HCMC People\u2019s Committee \nand  funded  by  the  Government  of  Germany,  and  other  plans  and  studies.  Preliminary \nenvironmental and social and resettlement reviews were undertaken in August 2005 and April \n2006, resulting in the Project\u2019s initial classification as category A, for both environment and \nresettlement. The later mission held discussions with various government agencies4 and with \nthe JBIC-financed Special Assistance for Project Formation study team. A memorandum of \nunderstanding (MOU) between the Urban Metro Preparation Unit (UMPU) and ADB was signed \non 13 May 2006. The MOU reflects the latest findings of the mission and the understandings \nreached with the Government on objectives, scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and \nterms of reference for the proposed TA.  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Viet Nam was among the world's fastest-growing economies in 2004 (7.5% GDP growth) \nand 2005 (8.1% GDP growth) and its large cities are the primary centers of economic activity. \nGreater HCMC is the largest city in Viet Nam and the country\u2019s economic hub, with a population \nforecast to grow by 2.1% per annum from the current 7.9 million to 13.5 million by 2020. In \n2004, private vehicles represented an abnormally high proportion (93%) of total journeys (19.1 \nmillion non-pedestrian journeys per day), broken down between motorcycles 78%, cars 1.2%, \nand bicycles 14%. Historically, car ownership has been lower than in comparable economies in \nthe region.5 With continued growth of the economy expected in the medium term, there is \nsignificant potential for household incomes to rise, enabling many more families to be able to \nafford to purchase cars (particularly as on 1 May 2006 the Government again allowed used cars \nto be imported, a move that is expected to lead to falls in prices). If current trends are not offset \nby better transport infrastructure and public transport systems, HCMC will face congestion, road \nsecurity, and air pollution difficulties similar to those in other large Asian cities such as Bangkok, \nBeijing, Manila, and Jakarta. The goal of HCMC People\u2019s Committee is to raise the share of \n                                                 \n1  The proposed HCMC Second Ring Road project under preparation with ADB led ADB and HCMC to agree to work \non the HCMC MRT and develop a comprehensive planning and institutional framework based on PPP/PSP for \nMRT in HCMC complementing other donors funded projects. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 1 June 2006. A Design and Monitoring Framework is \nincluded in Appendix 1. \n3  Comprising Hubert Jenny, Senior Project Engineer (Mission Leader); Jeanne Everett, Infrastructure Development \nSpecialist; David Bray, Senior Transport/Institutional Specialist; Phil Sayeg, Senior Transport/Financial Specialist; \nLe Ding Thang, Program Implementation Specialist. \n4  Department of Planning and Investment, UMPU, DTUPW, Management and Operation Center for Public Transport, \nDepartment of Urban Planning and Architecture. \n5  By mid-2005, only 1 in 145 people had a car, compared with 1 in 4\u20135 in Malaysia, 1 in 9\u201310 in Thailand and 1 in \n30\u201332 in the Philippines (Source: People's Daily, 20 March 2006). \n ", "2   \npublic transport to carry 25% of all daily motorized trips by 2010 and 50% by 2020, a sharp \nincrease from mid 2005 levels which were as low as 2%.6 \n5.  The HCMC People\u2019s Committee has prepared an MRT plan with a system of six lines to \nbe developed in the period to 2020. It will require a total investment likely to exceed $5 billion. It \nis envisaged that public and private sector financing will be required because of the anticipated \ncommunity and environmental benefits of the project, the size of the initial investment, and the \nneed to fill the gap between anticipated costs and revenues. Several feasibility studies have \nexamined sometimes overlapping MRT lines and their integration into a wider mass transport \nplan for HCMC. These include the Study on Urban Transport Master Plan and Feasibility Study \nin Ho Chi Minh Metropolitan Area (HOUTRANS) funded by the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency (JICA), the Urban MRT  \u201cUMRT line 1\u201d study by the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation (JBIC), the Feasibility Study for the Two Priority Lines in the METropolitan RAil \nSystem  (METRAS)  funded  by  the  German  Government,7 the  MRT  \u201clines  1,  2,  3\u201d  by  the \nGovernment of Russia, the Tramway Study by the Government of France, and the general \ndemand model by the Department for International Development of the UK (DFID). A bus rapid \ntransit (BRT) study is being completed by the World Bank. It is still uncertain which of these \ninitiatives, if any, are likely to result in firm investment plans. However, the UMRT 1 line is \ncurrently being examined as part of a more detailed study by JBIC. The proposed TA project will \nhelp to foster a competitive and efficient public transport market that will encourage citizens to \nshift to the MRT. It will help to define how public\u2013private partnerships and innovative financing \nschemes can be applied in the mass transport sector in Viet Nam. ADB will help to link the \nbilateral donors already actively involved in the urban transport sector.  \n6.  The UMPU in the HCMC People\u2019s Committee\u2019s Department of Transport and Urban \nPublic Works (DTUPW) is responsible for planning and implementing the system. The two lines \nas conceived will cover a total of 20.6 kilometers (km), with 22 stations, traversing the central \nbusiness district of HCMC. They have been approved in principle by the Prime Minister and will \nbe integrated into a wider intermodal city mass transit master plan.  \nA.  Consolidated MRT Network Master Plan and Design Parameters \n7.  HCMC People\u2019s Committee needs to prioritize, integrate, and optimize the various MRT \nproposals into a coherent and suitable transport master plan. Without such a master plan the \nproposed MRT project lines will not form an integrated system that will maximize benefits, \nminimize costs, and deliver services to HCMC citizens at the lowest possible fares. A master \nplan would also (i) confirm whether the two proposed lines are potentially suitable projects for \nADB financing and in what form; (ii) show the links and relative roles of all MRT lines, BRT lines, \nand other bus and commuter rail and road investments; (iii) provide a basis for integrated spatial \nplanning  and  development  management;  (iv)  assist  in  coordinating  planning  of  MRT \ninvestments and complementary facilities; and (v) provide a basis for more detailed preparation \nof the project lines. \nB.  Preliminary Engineering Design and Project Feasibility \n8.  To date, MRT feasibility studies have been carried out only to a prefeasibility stage and \non a stand-alone basis. Further studies are needed to establish engineering and operational \nissues and to ensure that the quantity and quality of MRT services will provide an attractive \n                                                 \n6  Figure provided by the METRAS Study (referenced below) for the share of bus transport alone, excluding taxis, \nand other forms of small scale public transport.  \n7  Transport East West Expert Team. 2003.

Over 60% of the projected MRT lines will be \nunderground and station locations will need to be fixed as accurately as possible in relation to \nadjacent  properties.  Further  geotechnical  testing  will  be  needed  to  aid  preliminary  design. \nConsideration will have to be given to the poor mapping of utilities in HCMC. Environmental and \nsocial aspects will need to be addressed in detail. \nC.  Project Implementation and Financing Options \n9.  Options for institutional arrangements during implementation and operation need to be \nconsidered in detail. Possible risks affecting demand and revenues for the project, as well as \ncosts and implementation schedules, need to be identified and a risk management strategy \nprepared. During the financial and economic evaluations of the project, special consideration \nneeds to be given to operational cost-recovery, the affordability of fares, and the relationship \nbetween demand and government policy on fare levels and potential subsidies. \n10.  The form and content of concession arrangements and the associated potential for \nprivate  sector  involvement  depends  on  the  availability  of  sustainable  revenues  and  other \nfinancing for operations. Potential non-fare revenue sources (such as associated commercial \ndevelopments, property taxes, fuel levies, and other special charges) will be critical.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA,  which  is  a  Project  Preparatory  Technical  Assistance,  will  advise  HCMC \nPeople\u2019s Committee on the integrated development of the first two MRT lines in HCMC. The \ngoal of the MRT is to provide convenient, comfortable, safe, affordable, and clean urban travel \nthat  improves  the  quality  of  urban  living  and  reduces  reliance  on  private  modes  of  travel \n(Appendix 1). An initial poverty and social assessment is included in Appendix 2. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will provide consulting and other services to the UMPU to develop plans to \nimplement the first two lines of a proposed MRT system for HCMC. The TA is divided into three \nparts. Part I will prepare a consolidated MRT network master plan and land use strategy that \nmaximizes  MRT  use  and  reflects  anticipated  demand.  Part  II  will  draw  up  preliminary \nengineering  design  and  technical  and  operational  standards,  with  supporting  social, \nenvironmental, technical, economic and financial appraisals. Part III will propose institutional \nand implementation arrangements and financing options, introducing and facilitating public\u2013 \nprivate partnerships and innovative financing approaches. It is anticipated that, subject to the \noutcome of the TA, before the investment loan ADB will finance detailed engineering design, \npreparation  of  tender  documentation,  and  other  preparatory  activities  to  support  the \nimplementation of the Project.  \n13.  The  TA  will  review  conventional  planning,  engineering,  and  institutional  techniques. \nEmphasis will be given to ensuring that the HCMC People\u2019s Committee can implement an \nintegrated approach that considers the full range of issues affecting the effective implementation \nand eventual operation of the project.  \n14.  Complementary  studies  on  urban  air  quality  management  will  be  considered  to \n(i) quantify  the  improvements  in  HCMC  from  the  project,  (ii)  provide  baseline  data  at  the \nbeginning of the implementation of the MRT projects, and (iii) review the impact on air quality of \nsound urban transport policies. Additional resources will be sought in partnership with the Clean \nAir Initiative for Asian Cities. \n ", "4   \n15.  The TA will be supplemented with a parallel study to review the options for public\u2013\nprivate partnerships for the MRT project. The objective of the review will be to determine an \nappropriate role for the private sector in implementing and operating the project, with a view to \nminimizing costs on a risk-adjusted basis and taking advantage of a market-oriented approach. \nThe review will build on previous work done in Thailand8 and will provide (i) a framework for \nconsidering private sector participation in implementing and operating the project; (ii) a value-\nfor-money analysis of implementation approaches that involve varying degrees of private sector \nparticipation  and  a  more  detailed  financial  model  reflecting  the  preferred  approach  and \nmeasuring the performance of the project from the points of view of the government and private \nsector  participants;  and  (iii)  a  description  of  necessary  institutional  and  contractual \narrangements given the preferred implementation approach. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.2 million equivalent, of which ADB will finance \n$1.7 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan The Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The Government will finance $0.5 million equivalent \nin-kind  through  the  provision  of  geotechnical  surveys,  in-city  transportation,  adequate  air \nconditioned office space, counterpart staff, and access to telecommunications facilities for the \nconsulting firm during implementation of the TA. The Executing Agency (EA) and consultants \nwill  be  located  in  the  same  office.  The  consulting  firm  will  provide  translators  to  prepare \nVietnamese versions of study reports. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months commencing in November 2006 \nand ending in April 2008. The UMPU will be the EA and will appoint a project director and a \ntechnical counterpart team. The team will be drawn from UMPU, other arms of DTUPW, the \nDepartment of Urban Planning and Architecture, and other agencies. The HCMC People\u2019s \nCommittee will appoint a steering committee, with representatives from UMPU, the People\u2019s \nCommittee, the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Finance, ADB, and other agencies.  \n18.  The TA will be implemented by a consulting firm. It will require about 60 international \nperson\u2013months and 100 national person\u2013months of consulting time during calendar year 2007. \nIt is expected that consulting services will be allocated as follows: part I (30%), part II (60%), \nand part III (10%). The international consulting firm will have expertise in transport and urban \nplanning; demand forecasting; civil, structural, geotechnical, tunnel, mechanical and electrical \nengineering;  rolling  stock;  rail  operations;  financial  and  economic  analysis;  environmental \nassessment; resettlement; social assessment; and institutional planning and capacity building. \nThe international consulting firm will be supported by domestic consultants in transport and \nurban planning; demand forecasting; engineering; institutional arrangements; law; financial and \neconomic  analyses;  resettlement,  environmental  and  social  planning;  and  translation.  The \nconsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. A list of local firms that have registered interest in the TA will be made. \n19.  The TA will use fixed budget selection, taking into account the importance of the project, \nthe need for a high-profile consultant project team, and the fact that the work will take place in a \nrelatively new subsector for ADB. The terms of reference are extensive and an outline is \npresented in Appendix 4. The request for proposals will include a matrix of consultant skills \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2005.

The \nconsulting firm will be asked to produce a simplified technical proposal as (i) the short-listing \nprocess will have already established that the firm has outstanding competence in the urban \ntransport sector and in the region; and (ii) the detailed terms of reference mean that only limited \ninput is expected on the methodology and technical approach. \n20.  An inception report and detailed work plan will be submitted within 1 month of the start of \nthe TA. Six dissemination and institutional capacity building workshops will take place with key \nstakeholders throughout the TA period. The consulting firm will provide a midterm report at the \nend of month 5 and a draft final report in month 10. The final report will be submitted at the end \nof month 12. In addition, the consulting firm will submit several working papers as detailed in the \noutline terms of reference (Appendix 4). \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n21.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \nThe Viet Nam country strategy and program, 2006-2009, stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable equitable \neconomic growth to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the share of the \npopulation below poverty from 70% in 1990 to 27% in 2005 was based on rapid but equitable economic growth. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy for Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is to develop public transport and road infrastructure to alleviate \ncongestion and open up new areas for urbanization. Public transport links to new urban areas will provide better \naccess to services and employment opportunities. The proposed project is expected to develop two MRT lines in Ho \nChi Minh City to provide convenient, comfortable, safe, affordable and clean urban travel. The MRT lines will provide a \ncheaper alternative to traveling by car and possibly motorcycle and lead to time savings for road passengers. An \nurban public transport system will help address growing pressures on traffic and the environment in high-density \nareas. These pressures will ultimately affect the quality of life, the working environment, the ability to attract \ninvestment into the project area, and access to services and will therefore help to reduce poverty. The Government\u2019s \npoverty reduction strategy will be reviewed to identify the role and impact of such large-scale infrastructure projects on \npoverty reduction of Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nFollowing ADB\u2019s enhanced poverty reduction strategy,1 projects classified as general interventions no longer require \nproject-level poverty assessments. However, social assessments will be prepared for resettlement, HIV/AIDS, and the \npersonal safety and security of passengers and staff. The resettlement plan will contain mitigation measures to \naddress impoverishment due to displacement and land acquisition.

In \naddition, an assessment will be done on the impact of MRT lines on private and public transportation user groups in \nterms of safety and saving of time and transport costs. Services and facilities for men and women in the metro stations \nwill be also identified. A gender plan for addressing gender concerns in the Project related to resettlement, HIV/AIDS, \nsafety measures, facilities in the station, and capacity building of the EA and relevant stakeholders will be prepared for \nthe proposed project. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Objective \n1.  The project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will assist the Urban Metro Preparation \nUnit (UMPU) to develop plans to implement two lines of a proposed rail mass rapid transit (MRT) \nsystem for Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). It is also anticipated, subject to the outcome of the TA, that \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance detailed engineering design, preparation of tender \ndocumentation, and other preparatory activities. A more detailed examination of implementation \narrangements and project financing will be undertaken as part of this work.  \nB.  Detailed Tasks \n1.  Part I: Consolidated Mass Rapid Transit Network Master Plan and Design \nParameters \n2.  The consultants will demonstrate the rationale for the Project by outlining the urban and \ntransport planning context, developing a consolidated MRT network master plan within which the \nproposed lines and other future public transport infrastructure and services can be developed, \nreviewing the proposed alignment of the two project lines, and presenting an updated project \nconcept and design parameters for the lines that will, following approval by the Government, be \ndetailed during the remainder of the TA.  \n3.  Specifically, the consultants will: (i) present the context for the Project by briefly describing \nand  analyzing  current  economic,  demographic,  land  use  and  transport  features  of  HCMC, \ncommitted and probable road development projects, and current public transport proposals; (ii) \nconduct traffic surveys and update and recalibrate for 2006 conditions an existing computerized \ntravel demand model.10 Planning forecasts (e.g., population and employment) for 2020 will be \nreviewed and modified as needed. Scenarios for a future integrated public transport system will be \ndeveloped and tested using a model to indicate their performance. Particular consideration will be \ngiven  to  options  for  developing  a  comprehensive  rail  MRT,  including  integration  of  currently \nisolated lines. The consultants will also present indicative costs and scenarios for alternative \napproaches to rail MRT to provide benchmarks to support informed decision making. \n4.  The consultants will estimate likely demand for the two project lines. The consultants should \nindicate: (i) the anticipated level of demand for each of the two project lines (including during peak \nhours, average weekday use, annual use, and the level of demand on which station and train \nservice capacity should be based); (ii) the likely sources of demand for the lines (i.e., the extent to \nwhich use of the lines will be transfers from other travel modes and the extent to which it is newly \ngenerated demand); (iii) anticipated demand at each station, transfers between MRT lines by \ndirection, and mode of access to and from the station; (iv) average trip length on the lines; (v) the \nlikely ramp up in use of the lines as people take advantage of the new services; and (vi) the \nsensitivity of demand to key variables such as fares (considering at least three fare scenarios\u2014(a) \nmaximization of fare revenue, (b) recovery of operating and maintenance costs from fare revenues \nusing  a  flat  fare,  and  (c)  distance-related  fares),  the  extent  of  the  rail  MRT  system  and  its \ndevelopment staging, population, economic growth, value of personal travel time, and car and \nmotorcycle ownership. A program of practical policy measures to improve the likelihood of forecast \ndemand being achieved should be proposed. In particular, attention should be given to policies \nregarding land use development in general and redevelopment of land in the vicinity of stations in \nparticular. \n                                                 \n10  Preferably the model developed during the Houtrans Study, which is based on the CUBE platform. The model is now \nat the Transport Development Study Institute of the Ministry of Transport in HCMC. Other agencies and firms may \nhave copies of this model or one developed in 1996 for a previous transport study. Data from the former model will be \nmade available to the consultants, who will need to make their own arrangements to implement and use an effective \ntravel demand model. \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \n5.  The consultants will propose an optimal integrated rail MRT network master plan. They will \nindicate the sensitivity performance of the two project lines with regard to other parts of the plan, \nincluding the sequence of network development and other transport investment. They will confirm \nthe  key  design  parameters  for  the  two  project  lines  that  are  consistent  with  service  quality \nstandards  and  underlying  demand  forecasts.  They  will  optimize  system  design,  and  ensure \nharmonized technical and commercial operations across the network. Consideration will be given \nto  options  for  the  vertical  and  horizontal  alignment  of  the  lines,  the  location  of  stations, \nimplementation of high-level design standards (including access to stations, air conditioning, gauge, \ngrades, curves, noise and vibration, power supply, signaling, rolling stock, and ticketing), and the \nstructure and level of fares. Indicative costs and benefits should be estimated to aid screening of \npotential options, with initial economic and financial evaluations prepared to guide decision making. \nRecommended design parameters should be documented for consideration and endorsement by \nthe Government to provide the basis for ongoing engineering design and a more detailed study of \nproject feasibility. The consultants will present their recommendations at a dissemination workshop \nof all key stakeholders. \n2.  Part II: Preliminary Engineering Design and Project Feasibility \n6.  Previous MRT feasibility studies have been carried out only to a prefeasibility stage and \ndesigns, if any, are conceptual. More detailed engineering, social (including poverty analysis and \nresettlement) and environmental investigations of the project lines are needed to provide the basis \nfor more accurate cost estimations, development of safeguard measures, and confirmation of \nproject feasibility. \n7.  To prepare the preliminary engineering design, the consultants will:  \n(i)  examine available geotechnical, cadastral, water chemistry and utility information \nand  specify  essential  additional  information  needed  to  support  the  work  of  the \ncurrent  study  in  time  to  allow  the  government  to  assemble  the  data,  including \nundertaking  additional surveys  as  needed  (the  HCMC  People\u2019s  Committee  has \nbudgeted $300,000 for surveys of up to 46 boreholes to collect further geotechnical \ninformation);  \n(ii)  prepare  engineering  specifications  for  civil  works,  railway  works,  electrical  and \nmechanical services (including power supply, signaling, ticketing and rolling stock) \nand for service provision to guide subsequent work in the study and to ensure \ndesign  standards  are  made  clear  for  ongoing  project  development  and \nimplementation (design standards should ensure costs over the lifecycle of the \nproject are minimized);  \n(iii)  prepare engineering layouts and plans for the recommended scheme in sufficient \ndetail  to  estimate  construction  quantities  and  project  cost  to  a  preliminary \nengineering standard\u2014this work will inform detailed engineering designs that will be \nundertaken after completion of the TA (it is expected that plans will generally be \nprepared  to  a  scale  of  at  least  1:500  in  critical  areas  and  to  a  suitable  scale \nelsewhere, with more detailed standard designs prepared for stations, structures, \ntunnels and other unique elements of the system);  \n(iv)  make  recommendations  on  construction  methods  that  take  account  of  impacts \nduring  construction  and  minimize  overall  costs  to  the  community,    review \nprocurement issues to allow project costs to be estimated, and, to support project \ncost estimation, develop plans to mitigate traffic, environmental and social impacts \nduring construction and operation of the Project; and  \n(v)  prepare best estimates (\u00b125% accuracy) and 90th percentile estimate of the capital \ncost of implementing the two project lines (i.e., respectively the expected median \ncost and the cost for which there is only a 10% probability of being exceeded), taxes, \nduties and physical and price contingencies should be identified separately and \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \ncosts, broken down into foreign exchange and local currency components, should \nbe identified separately for individual project components and should include all \nitems needed to ensure the delivery of a sustainable, operational project. \n8.  To prepare for project implementation, the consultants will:  \n(i)  identify potential options for implementing the project, including sections of lines and \nstations (accommodating budget or construction industry constraints) and propose \nan implementation schedule to allow financial disbursements to be estimated and \nproject implementation to be planned;  \n(ii)  prepare a risk analysis for project implementation and outline a strategy to manage \ndesign and construction risk; and  \n(iii)  prepare indicative timetables and operating plans for train services on project lines \nand use this information to determine rolling stock and operating resource needs, \nand to estimate operating and maintenance costs for the system (this should include \na comment on the effect on costs of operation by a public or private agency).  \n9.  On the institutional framework, the consultants will: \n(i)  assess options for a ticketing system and for revenue management (account should \nbe taken of the need for an integrated ticketing system for both lines and for other \nMRT lines that might also be developed in the future); and  \n(ii)  estimate fare revenue and other potential direct sources of revenue to the operator \nof  the  system,  identify  opportunities  for  revenue  generation  from  property \ndevelopment  and  other  sources,  and  prepare  a  risk  management  strategy  to \nfacilitate achievement of the revenue targets.  \n10.  On  safeguard  compliance,  the  Project  has  received  an  initial  A  classification  for  both \nresettlement and environment. The consultants will identify the need for land acquisition for the \nproject, as well as access restrictions that will be imposed and changes in land use and the \nnumber of people who will be affected permanently and temporarily by all project components \n(including MRT lines, depot, stations, borrow pits, and work camps). The consultants will ensure \nseverance impacts are identified and addressed. They will assist the HCMC People\u2019s Committee to \nprepare, and lay the basis for the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of a resettlement plan \nthat is in accordance with ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995) and the provisions in its \nOperations Manual (section F2/BP). They will establish the cost of resettlement, compensation and \nincome  restoration  measures.  The  consultants  will  review  the  HCMC  People\u2019s  Committee \ncompensation proposals and prepare detailed resettlement plans based on national laws and \nADB's policy on involuntary resettlement. Some initial preparation of land has started on a site that \nis planned to accommodate people displaced by construction of the two project lines (this site is \nalso proposed as a depot for a possible future MRT line extension). Due diligence will be done on \nthe initial land preparation and, if people were affected as a result of land preparation, a new \nresettlement plan will be prepared. If the existing site for relocation is being reserved as a depot, \nthe consultants will identify other relocation sites and assess suitability in terms of location, quality \nof site, and development needs and prepare measure for AP integration with host communities. \nResettlement plans will include socioeconomic surveys and social and gender analyses, with full \nconsultation and timely disclosure of project and resettlement information, in accordance with \nADB's policy on involuntary resettlement, and also ADB. Gender and development (2003); and \nADB. Public Communications Policy (2005) and the requirements of the Government of Viet Nam. \nA  poverty  assessment,  a  participation  strategy  and  a  social  monitoring  program  will  also  be \nprepared.  The  consultants  will  also  conduct  an  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  a \nsummary environmental assessment, and environmental management plans in accordance with \nADB's Environment Policy (2002), ADB\u2019s Operations Manual F1/BP and F1/OP (2003) and other \nenvironmental assessment guidelines. Identify adverse and beneficial impacts of the project, and \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nprepare an environmental monitoring program, estimate the cost of the program, and establish \nimplementation arrangements. \n11.  The consultants will also prepare financial and economic evaluations for the proposed \nproject in accordance with ADB guidelines, notably an extensive assessment as explained in ADB. \nGuidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects (1997) (paragraphs 112\u2013115) and following the ADB \nFinancial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005)  to  assess  and  address  any  fiduciary \nconcerns. Considering the large size of the proposed MRT projects for HCMC, the consultants \nshould review the impact at the national level on foreign exchange, debt management, and budget \nexpenditure and should make an assessment of the affordability of such projects. The evaluations \nshould take account of whole-of-life costs associated with planning, construction and operation of \nthe two project lines, and should propose key scenarios (e.g., base case, upside, downside), \nincorporating quantitative sensitivity testing of key variables to indicate the probability of outcomes \nbeing achieved. In the economic evaluation, attention should be paid to defining the appropriate \n\u201cwithout project\u201d case, and to external costs and benefits of the lines (including disruption during \nconstruction, reduced traffic congestion when completed, and environmental impacts) in addition to \nother benefits such as savings in travel time and vehicle operating costs. The consultants should \nidentify  impacts  not  included  in  the  economic  evaluation  as  well  as  beneficiary  groups. \nConsideration should be given to options for staging implementation of the project, and to the \naffordability of fares. The financial viability (financial internal rate of return, and operating and \ncapital cost recovery) and economic merit (economic internal rate of return and net present value) \nof the project should be reported. \n3.  Part III: Project Implementation and Financing Options \n12.  Work  will  be  undertaken  to  develop  a  plan  to  support  implementation  of  the  project, \nincluding capacity building and financing. The consultants will:  \n(i)  confirm key legal issues and approvals that must be taken into account in planning \nfor project approval, construction and operation and in particular to accommodate \nprivate sector partnership arrangements;  \n(ii)  examine institutional arrangements for the delivery of infrastructure and operation of \nservices, and recommend an approach;  \n(iii)  identify opportunities for private sector involvement in financing, implementing and \noperating the project, using the results of the financial evaluation (it is anticipated \nthat the project infrastructure will be delivered through design-build arrangements \nwith performance-based contracts);  \n(iv)  prepare a detailed program and estimated cost for the ongoing work needed to \nfurther prepare the project, leading to international competitive bidding for project \nimplementation and provide input to terms of reference for ongoing engineering \ndesign work;  \n(v)  describe  in  detail  the  responsibilities,  structure  and  staffing  needs  of  the \norganization(s)  involved  in  this  work  and  identify  capacity  building  and  staff \ndevelopment needs for these organization(s), including a training program and study \ntours  to  cover  supervision  and  coordination  of  the  design,  implementation  and \noperation  of  the  project  in  collaboration  with  various  stakeholders,  including \nprocurement and implementation of safeguards;  \n(vi)  comment on potential sources of finance for project implementation, identify the gap \nbetween the estimated costs and revenues of the project, present a justification for \nan MRT subsidy (if one is required), identify potential sources of revenue to finance \nthe gap (e.g., land taxation and special levies), and identify issues that should be \naddressed in the more detailed study of implementation arrangements and project \nfinancing; and summarize risks associated with implementation of the project and \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nsubsequent operation of services, and prepare a strategy that the Government can \nuse to manage the risks. \n4.  Reporting \n13.  The consultants will prepare reports in English, with summaries translated into Vietnamese. \nThe final report and the preliminary engineering design will be translated into Vietnamese. All \nreports will be submitted in both electronic and paper form to ADB. All data and analyses will be \nconsolidated and provided to the government in electronic form. \n14.  The consultants will also prepare technical working papers according to schedule during the \nstudy. Responses to comments on working papers may be presented as addendums to the papers. \nFifteen copies of draft working papers and twenty copies of final versions will be provided. It is \nanticipated that technical working papers will include: (i) project context and MRT network master \nplan;  (ii)  alignment  review  and  Project  concept;  (iii)  technical  specifications  and  preliminary \nengineering design (with engineering drawings); (iv) capital costs and ongoing maintenance and \noperating costs, and revenue; (v) resettlement plans and environmental and social assessments; \n(vi)  financial  and  economic  analyses;  and  (vii)  project  implementation,  risk  management, \ninstitutional arrangements, and financing options. \n15.  The consultants will prepare a final report. This will focus on the findings of the study and \nthe actions needed to implement the Project. Fifteen copies of the draft final report and 20 copies \nof the final version will be provided. The consultants will prepare the following administrative \nreports: (i) an inception report 1 month after commencement of the study and (ii) a midterm report \nat the end of month 5. Six copies of each administrative report will be provided. The consultants \nwill organize six dissemination and institutional capacity building workshops to take place with key \nstakeholders during the TA period. Three will be held in HCMC and three in Hanoi or another major \nVietnamese city. \n16.  In addition, using standard ADB board document formats and guidelines, the consultants \nwill draft the following: (i) ADB safeguard documents (resettlement, social, and environment); \n(ii) Board documents for a proposed technical assistance loan (or equivalent) for detailed project \npreparation; and (iii) Board documents for a loan investment project. \nC.  Study Schedule and Consultancy Requirements \n17.  It is anticipated that the TA will commence in January 2007. Work on parts I, II, and III will \noverlap to expedite the TA. Part I will be completed within 4 months of the commencement of the \nTA, part II within 9 months, and part III within 10 months. The draft final report will be submitted in \nOctober 2007. \n18.  The team leader will ensure the efficient and effective undertaking of the TA. The team \nleader must work for the project full-time, be located in HCMC for the duration of the study, be a \nlong-term senior member of staff of the company, and must have the authority to act on the firm\u2019s \nbehalf to achieve the objectives of the TA. Other members of the team should have sufficient \nbreadth and depth of skills to minimize the number of individual team members, thus aiding \nefficiency and adding coherence to project delivery. An individual consultant can cover more than \none skill area, in which case his or her curriculum vitae will be evaluated independently for each of \nthe skill areas covered. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20061106140515+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20061025143814+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - VIE-HCMC METRAS PROJECT.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 (Windows)", "Author": "ECL"}, "author_page": " \n \nVice President  C.
