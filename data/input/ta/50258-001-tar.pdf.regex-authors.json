The technical assistance (TA) will support the banking and finance sectors in developing \nmember  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  improve  the \nimplementation of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) \nregulatory measures, and strengthen the capacity of domestic banks and nonbank financial \ninstitutions (NBFIs) to comply with the requirements of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  \nIt is aligned with the ADB policy on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism,1 \nwhich calls on ADB to (i) assist DMCs in establishing and implementing effective legal and \ninstitutional systems to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism, (ii) increase \ncollaboration  with  other  international  organizations,  and  (iii)  strengthen  internal  controls  to \nsafeguard ADB funds. The TA supports good governance and capacity development, which \ncomprise one of the five drivers of change under Strategy 2020.2  The TA will also support goal \n16 of the Sustainable Development Goals, which aims to strengthen the rule of law and the \nparticipation of developing countries in the institutions of global governance.3 \n \n2.  Fact-finding missions were fielded from 5 September 2016 to 25 October 2016 with the \nfollowing objectives: (i) introduce the proposed TA to a broad set of international stakeholders, \nincluding ADB DMCs and other development partners, among them the Asia/Pacific Group on \nMoney Laundering; (ii) gauge the level of interest of ADB DMCs in the TA; (iii) coordinate with \nother development partners on the timing and scope of the TA; and (iv) in consultation with the \nfinancial  intelligence  units, key  agencies,  and  industry  representatives  of selected  DMCs,4 \nfinalize the scope, outputs, implementation arrangements, consulting terms of reference and \ntimetable for the TA and its subprojects, and the design and monitoring framework. 5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A  broad  range  of  economic  analyses  point  to  the  conclusion  that  strong  financial \ninstitutions\u2014such  as  small  domestic  banks  and  NBFIs\u2014are  critical  to  economic growth  in \ndeveloping countries because these institutions allow for the concentration of capital resources \nfrom domestic savings and the efficient allocation of such resources to investment projects that \ngenerate  sustained  economic  development  (footnote  1).  Unfortunately,  money  laundering \nimpairs  the  development  of  these  financial  institutions,  especially  in  developing  countries, \nbecause  of  the  risks  associated  with  money  laundering  and  their  impact  on  customer \nconfidence.6 The adoption of AML/CFT policies by financial intelligence units and other relevant \nnational authorities (i.e., supervisory and regulatory agencies, including self-regulatory bodies, if \napplicable), as well as financial institutions (where they include adequate know-your-customer \nrules and the strengthening of internal controls), are intended to protect such institutions from \nthe negative effects of money laundering and the financing of terrorism (footnote 1). \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2003. Enhancing the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Sustainable  Development  Goals.  \nhttp://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html. \n4  Particularly Bhutan, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 November 2016.  \n6  Money laundering serves to erode financial institutions (there is a correlation between money laundering and \nfraudulent activities undertaken by employees); in addition, the perceived risk to depositors and investors from \ninstitutional fraud and corruption is an obstacle to trust. \n ", "2   \n4.  However, these same AML/CFT policies and requirements can also affect the prospect \nand ability of domestic financial institutions (DFIs), including domestic banks, to participate and \ncompete internationally. Overly strict approaches to AML/CFT may inadvertently limit financial \naccess, especially in jurisdictions with nascent financial systems. Many financial institutions \nhave opted to end relationships that are assessed as high risk, unprofitable, or complex\u2014such \nas those involving money service businesses, foreign embassies, international charities, and \ncorrespondent banks.7 This practice is otherwise known as de-risking, and it seems to have \nbeen a trend since the 2008 financial crisis, aggravated by a misapplication of the AML/CFT \nrequirements  and  the  risk-based  approach.    Global  financial  developments  such  as  the \ntightening  of  financial  controls  and  standards,  and  the  issuance  of  the  2012  FATF \nRecommendations, have led to international banks severing or limiting correspondent banking \nrelationships  with  small  domestic  banks  and  NBFIs  in  risky  jurisdictions.8   Many  financial \ninstitutions are struggling to keep pace with these global financial developments, and the FATF \nrequirement that financial institutions apply a risk-based approach to identifying, assessing, and \nadopting effective measures to mitigate the risks associated with AML/CFT.9  \n \n5.  The response of international banks to these developments with respect to the provision \nof  correspondent  banking  services  varies,  depending  on  several  elements,  such  as  their \nassessment of in-country risks, business decisions regarding risk-taking, and their areas of \nspecialization  or  comparative  advantage.  The  TA  fact-finding  missions  found  that  some \ndomestic de-risking is also occurring, such as when large domestic banks decide to close the \naccounts of money service businesses due to the compliance risks posed by this segment of \nthe  local  industry.  As  a  result,  while  some  respondent  banks  that  fit  within  one  of  the \ninternational  banks\u2019  correspondent  banking  business  strategies  are  likely  to  maintain  their \ncorrespondent banking relationships, other financial institutions and designated nonfinancial \nbusinesses  and  professions  (DNFBPs)  risk  being  cut  off  from  the  international  payment \nnetworks  (footnote  9).  Further,  financial  institutions  that  might  risk  losing  access  to \ncorrespondent services tend to (i) be smaller institutions that generate low payment volumes; (ii) \nbe located in jurisdictions perceived to be very risky; (iii) not be part of an international group; or \n(iv) provide payment services to customers for whom an adequate risk assessment is not \navailable, due to a lack of necessary information (footnote 9). \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The impact of the TA will be that the legal and institutional systems to combat money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism are established and implemented effectively (footnote \n1). The outcome will be strengthened capacity of DFIs to comply with the FATF AML/CFT \nrequirements. \n \n \n                                                \n7  T. Durner and L. Shetret. 2015.

A TA cluster is considered the most appropriate modality to address the challenges and \nissues at both the regulatory and operational levels, and develop a knowledge product that \nconsolidates the resulting lessons. It will ensure that outputs are delivered at a pace that is \ncompatible with the political and operational situation in the selected DMCs. Three regional \nsubprojects will each focus on a key aspect of the TA. The TA will cover DMCs that were \nidentified as being well-placed to maximize the TA impacts, based on a number of factors \naddressed by the ADB anti-money laundering policy (footnote 1), such as the level of demand \nfor the assistance, the opportunity to follow up on prior ADB assistance, the opportunity to \nsupport key reforms initiated by the government concerned, or the need to address special \nproblems and circumstances posed by a DMC. The DMCs covered by the TA include Bhutan, \nMongolia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines. Consultations with the relevant national \nauthorities of these DMCs were undertaken during the fact-finding missions. Other countries, \nsuch as Myanmar, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam, may also be considered during TA implementation. \n \n8.  Subproject A: Developing risk-based customer due diligence requirements and \ntools. Subproject A will support national authorities to improve the regulatory environment in the \nselected  DMCs.  FATF  recommendation  1  on  assessing  risks  and  applying  a  risk-based \napproach notes that \u201c[c]ountries should require financial institutions and designated [DNFBPs] \nto identify, assess and take effective action to mitigate their money laundering and terrorist \nfinancing risks.\u201d10 The Interpretative Notes to the FATF recommendations further state that \nfinancial institutions and DNFBPs need to have policies, controls, and procedures that enable \nthem to manage and effectively mitigate the identified risks, and to monitor (and if needed \nenhance) implementation of controls.11 Recommendation 10, regarding  customer due diligence \n(CDD),  states  that  each  country  may  determine  how  it  imposes  specific  CDD  obligations, \nthrough law or other enforceable means (footnote 9). \n \n9.  To  address  these  risk-focused  requirements  of  the  FATF  recommendations,  this \nsubproject will support national authorities to develop and issue AML/CFT risk-based CDD \nrequirements and tools for DFIs (and, if necessary, DNFBPs) that are intended to improve \nimplementation of national AML/CFT regulatory measures. It will also build their capacity and \nupdate their procedures. These efforts may also target national corporate registration systems \nand data sources that are accessed by financial institutions (particularly domestic banks) and \nDNFBPs in complying with CDD requirements, so that access to and use of these increases. \nThe  CDD  requirements  and  tools  will  provide  increased  clarity  regarding  the  risk-based \napproach, and the extent to which flexibility and subjectivity can be exercised within the FATF \nAML/CFT  standards. They  will  also  ensure  that  domestic  entities  can  access reliable  and \nupdated data; are able to generate adequate information regarding their customers and can flag \nissues; and, when necessary, can effectively generate and submit reports regarding suspicious \ntransactions and cash transactions. \n \n10.  These outputs will be closely linked with and complement any prior assistance provided \nby ADB to DMCs to develop or strengthen AML/CFT legal and institutional systems. The fact-\nfinding mission revealed that a number of DMCs have issued CDD guidelines for their domestic \nbanks.  This  subproject  should  be  flexible  in  meeting  the  current  and  actual  needs  of  the \n                                                \n10 FATF.  2012.

Subproject  B:  Support  domestic  financial  institutions  to  identify,  assess,  and \naddress risks. Subproject B will support DFIs in the selected DMCs to develop the required \npolicies, controls, and procedures to enable them to identify, manage, and effectively mitigate \nrisks. FATF recommendation 10 on CDD and record-keeping lists the CDD measures that \nfinancial institutions should take, and indicates that financial institutions should determine the \nextent  of  such  measures  using  a  risk-based  approach. 12 FATF  recommendation  13  on \ncorrespondent banking lists additional CDD measures for domestic banks that are engaged in \ncross-border correspondent banking and other similar relationships (footnote 12). In light of the \nfocus of FATF recommendations 10 and 13 on CDD, and recommendations 24 and 25 that deal \nwith transparency and beneficial ownership of legal persons and arrangements, this subproject \nwill support DFIs in developing and implementing enhanced due diligence procedures and \npractices,  and  incorporating  risk-based  approaches  in  their  respective  methodologies.  This \nsubproject will also help build the capacity of DFIs to effectively use adequate know-your-\ncustomer tools and approaches, and adapt these to any given risk scenario. Support is also \nneeded to help DFIs improve how they identify their customers\u2019 ultimate beneficial ownership. \n \n12.  Within the DMCs covered by this subproject, the number and type of DFIs supported will \ndepend on the findings and results of subproject A; in addition, consideration will be given to \nwhether DFIs (i) participate in ADB-financed activities; (ii) have demonstrated capacity to serve \nADB\u2019s  development  objectives,  typically  relating  to  the  provision  of  financial  services  to \nunderserved  segments  of  the  population,  such  as  low-income  households  and  small \nbusinesses;  and  (iii)  operate  in  countries  considered  by  FATF  to  be  high-risk  and \nnoncooperative jurisdictions, or jurisdictions having strategic deficiencies. The TA will (i) support \nADB-financed activities, such as financial institution loans; loans under the Trade Finance and \nFacilitation Program; and private sector lending and development activities; and (ii) improve \nADB\u2019s ability to execute payments to DMCs associated with approved operational activities, \nsuch as payments to suppliers, service providers, consultants, and executing and implementing \nagencies. \n \n13.  Subproject  C:  Capacity  development  program.  Subproject  C  will  leverage  the \nexperience and lessons gained from subprojects A and B to develop and implement (i) a \nknowledge  product  on  AML/CFT  compliance  for  DFIs  throughout  the  region;13 and  (ii)  a \ncomprehensive AML/CFT capacity development program for DFIs that includes interactive e-\nlearning  modules.  The  knowledge  product  will  cover  broad  international  approaches  and \ncountry-specific scenarios; although similarities can be expected among DFIs in different areas, \nthe TA design reflects the fact that each financial institution faces unique internal and external \nchallenges, as well as different national operating environments. A workshop will be held to \ndisseminate the TA experience, accomplished outputs, and updates on AML/CFT. \n \n \n                                                \n12 FATF.  2012.

Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will implement the TA through its Office of Anticorruption and Integrity. Upon TA \napproval,14 the subproject proposals will be submitted for approval by the head of the Office of \nAnticorruption and Integrity. Subprojects will be designed and developed in close collaboration \nwith  the Office  of  the General  Counsel  and ADB  regional  departments  (including  resident \nmissions). ADB will also coordinate closely with pertinent DMC governments, particularly the \nrelevant national authorities, with respect to all aspects of implementation. The TA is expected \nto  be  implemented  from  January  2017  to  December  2021;15 implementation  periods  for \nindividual  subprojects  are  expected  to  be  as  follows:  (i)  January  2017  -  December  2018 \n(subproject A); (ii) January 2019 - December 2020 (subproject B); and (iii) January - December \n2021 (subproject C). The TA will require a total of 48 person-months of international consulting \nservices  and  124  person-months  of  national  consulting  services.  A  project  management \nconsultant will be recruited to provide project management support for the TA and ensure \nconsistency across all covered DMCs and subprojects; other consultants will perform tasks on \nan intermittent basis. ADB may also recruit resource persons for the workshops to be conducted \nunder the TA. Because this is a cluster TA that comprises separate and distinct subprojects, \nand considering that the type of specialization will depend heavily on the specific need identified \nfor  each  country  and  financial  institution,16 consultant  selection  will  use  varying  methods \ndepending on the size and nature of each contract. Given the diverse types of services required, \nthe need for flexibility to match in-country needs, and the relative novelty of the practices and \nspecialized nature of the subject matter, expertise will reside primarily with individuals (as \nopposed  to  firms),  and  individual  consultant  selection  will  be  the  primary  approach  used. \nConsultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).17 The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. The TA will also cover the costs of interpretation and translation, \nand other miscellaneous costs. Disbursement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor Developing Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism Approaches, \nMethodologies, and Controls, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 The TA was determined to be category A (ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance. Operations Manual. OM D12/BP. \nManila), and was reviewed by a technical expert from ADB\u2019s Finance Sector Group. \n15 TA activities will not start in a DMC unless a no-objection letter has been obtained from the government. \n16 Some DMCs may require legal drafting skills, some may need experts with extensive experience with FATF and \nFATF-style regional bodies, while others may require information technology-related experience with AML/CFT \nsoftware. \n17 Lump-sum payments and output-based contracts will be considered for consulting services. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned With \nLegal and institutional systems to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism are \nestablished and implemented effectivelya \n \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapacity of DFIs to  100% of participating DFIs  a.
