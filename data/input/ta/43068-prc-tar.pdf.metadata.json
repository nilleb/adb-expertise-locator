INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2008  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested Asian Development Bank's (ADB) assistance to prepare the \nPolicy Study on Government Public Expenditure in Agricultural Production. The policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) will review the central and local governments' agricultural \nexpenditures  in  terms  of  their  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and  interagency  coordination;  and \nprovide decision makers policy recommendations and the necessary tools to strengthen the \nagriculture sector. ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission on 10 January 2009, and a fact-\nfinding  mission  in  Beijing  during  30\u201331  March  2009.  The  missions  held  discussions  with \nrepresentatives of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the National Development and Reform \nCommission (NDRC), and the Ministry of Finance (MOF). During the discussions, the need for \nand the scope of the proposed TA were confirmed.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC agriculture sector made impressive advances through the 1990s and into the \nnew millennium, including marked gains in land and labor productivity and food output. In 2006, \nagriculture accounted for 11.7% of the PRC\u2019s gross domestic product, and agricultural cropland \nreached 157 million hectares. Growth in agricultural production has enabled the country to feed \nmore than a fifth of the world\u2019s population from an eighth of the world\u2019s arable land.   \n \n3.  Acknowledging the strategic importance of agricultural production to the country\u2019s food \nsecurity  and  economic  development,  the  Government  is  committed  to  modernizing  its \nagriculture sector by improving the policy environment and steadily increasing government \nexpenditures. The agricultural law was amended in 2002 and the Government set the national \npolicy to accelerate agricultural production in 2004. The Government\u2019s agricultural policy, which \nfocuses on agricultural subsidies and rural infrastructure investments, has become one of the \ncornerstones of the PRC\u2019s new countryside development strategy.     \n \n4.  A comprehensive public expenditure review is needed to examine factors that constrain \nagricultural  production  in  the  PRC.  There  is  a  lack  of  quantifiable  targets  of  government \nexpenditures in current agricultural legislation and policies. Although a general national target is \noften set, it is unclear how much expenditure is required at the different levels of government. \nThere is no clear policy on subsector prioritization. Huge regional and provincial differences also \nprevent a national agricultural expenditure policy from being formulated. There are also unclear \nmandates and responsibilities of different government agencies that prevent the establishment \nof  an  integrated  agricultural  expenditure  system  to  streamline  the  decision  making,  and \nmonitoring and supervision processes. There is also a need to formulate clear strategies so that \nprivate investment can complement public expenditure to increase farmers\u2019 incomes, promote \nsmall farms and agribusiness, and strengthen food production and quality. \n \n5.  The lack of awareness and understanding of the impacts of global climate change and \nwater scarcity on agricultural production has also prevented the formulation of an effective \nadaptation policy and its integration into the planning of government agricultural expenditures. \nClimate change is expected to cause a rise in temperature, rainfall redistribution, and more \nfrequent flooding and droughts. These could exert considerable impacts on the agriculture \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 April 2009. \n ", "2   \nsector. Recent studies2 show that the overall impact on crop production, assuming there is no \nincreased carbon dioxide fertilization,3 is a 7%\u201314% reduction in rice, a 9%\u201310% reduction in \nmaize, and a 2%\u20139% reduction in wheat. Assuming an average reduction of 7%, or about 40 \nmillion metric tons of food grain due to climate changes, this represents about 20% of the global \ngrain trade. Such a loss would undermine food security in the PRC and the world, with serious \nconsequences for the poor. The situation is even more complex below the provincial level, \ndepending on geographical conditions.  \n \n6.  Strategy 20204 is consistent with the Government\u2019s plans in three strategic areas: (i) \ninvesting in rural productivity improvement and inclusive growth, (ii) investing in sustainable \nnatural resource use and conservation, and (iii) strengthening the enabling environment and \nlocal institutional capacity for decentralized and participatory rural investments. All these areas \ncall for an active government expenditure policy that should be efficient, effective, and well \ncoordinated among different government agencies.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA is enhanced sustainable agricultural production and food security \nin the PRC. The outcome of the TA is the enhanced ability of concerned government agencies \nto adopt effective public expenditure policies and plans for increasing agricultural production. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  To attain the expected impact, four outputs or components have been identified: (i) \nreview of the central and local governments' agricultural production and public expenditure \npolicies, (ii) assessment of the institutional and operational mechanisms of the central and local \ngovernments' public expenditures on agricultural production, (iii) assessment of the impact of \nclimate change and its implications on food security, and (iv) policy recommendations and \nadvocacy. \n \n9.  Component  1:    Review  of  the  Central  and  Local  Governments'  Agricultural \nProduction  and  Public  Expenditure  Policies.  This  component  will  (i)  review  agricultural \nexpenditures and policies; (ii) assess the experiences, challenges, and lessons learned; (iii) \nconduct  field  studies;  (iv)  assess  the  potential  for  adoption  of  international  practices  and \nexperiences; (v) assess the future position of the agriculture sector in the national economy; and \n(vi) recommend future priorities for the PRC\u2019s agricultural public expenditure policy and strategy.  \n \n10.  Component 2: Assessment of Institutional and Operational Mechanisms of the \nCentral and Local Governments' Public Expenditures on Agricultural Production. This \ncomponent will (i) assess the effectiveness and evolution of the management and supervision \nmechanism  of  the  central  and  local  governments'  agricultural  investments,  (ii)  assess  the \nefficiency of the decision-making process and the institutional constraints of the Government\u2019s \n                                                 \n2  Xiong Wei, Conway Declanc, Lin Erdaa, Xu Yinlonga, Ju Huia, Jiang Jinhed, Holman Iane, and Li Yan. 2008. \nFuture cereal production in China: The interaction of climate change, water availability, and socio-economic \nscenarios.

Component  3:  Assessment  of  Climate  Change  Impact  and  its  Implications  on \nFood Security. The component will (i) assess the impact of climate change on crop productivity \nand  its  implications  for  food  security  at  the  national  and  subnational  levels;  (ii)  study  the \nimplications  for  subnational  agricultural  specialization  and  government  planning,  including \ntransportation networks and intra-national trade patterns; and (iii) collect and analyze adaptation \nand mitigation practices at the local level.   \n \n12.  Component 4: Policy Recommendations and Advocacy. The findings of the above \nthree components will be disseminated through (i) a series of policy notes, (ii) journal articles, (iii) \nacademic books, (iv) high-level policy forums, and (v) recommendations on government action \nplans in order to advocate an enabling investment strategy for a revitalized agriculture sector. \nThese findings will be submitted to key stakeholders including the MOA, MOF, NDRC, and \npossibly the State Council, which will also be considered in the preparation of the 12th Five-Year \nPlan (2011\u20132015).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,122,000 equivalent. It is proposed that ADB \nprovide  $500,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  its  TA  funding  program  (Technical \nAssistance Special Fund-others), and $500,000 equivalent from its Climate Change Fund.5 The \nGovernment  will  finance  the  remaining  $122,000  equivalent  in  kind  covering  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, site transportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimates for the TA \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOA will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. MOA has been the EA of several \nADB lending and TA projects, and has a proven record of staff capacities. A leading group will \nbe established, chaired by the Director General of the Department of Development Planning in \nMOA. The leading group will provide overall guidance on the TA\u2019s direction. Its members will \nmeet and provide guidance through several TA workshops.  \n \n15.  A TA management office will be established in the Department of Development Planning \nto carry out day-to-day TA operations. The Department\u2019s Deputy Director General will serve as \nthe head of the office and function as the overall TA coordinator. The office will be responsible \nfor day-to-day communications and operational matters among ADB, consultants, and related \ngovernment agencies.  \n \n16.  An advisory committee will be established in Beijing to ensure the overall quality and \nacceptance of the TA outputs. The committee will include senior experts from key research \ninstitutes,  including  the  Chinese  Academy  of  Agricultural  Sciences  and  China  Agricultural \nUniversity. The findings of the TA will be discussed with a group of senior policy makers from \nvarious key ministries, including MOF and NDRC. \n \n17.  TA implementation will take 24 months, from August 2009 to July 2011. Implementation \nprogress will be monitored through inception, interim, draft final review meetings, workshops, \n                                                 \n5  Established by ADB.  \n ", "4   \nand conferences. The leading group of the EA and the advisory committee will meet with the \nconsultants on a quarterly basis to monitor TA implementation progress. ADB will participate in \nthe workshops. The research achievements of various stages will be circulated internally for \nperusal in the form of brief reports and research papers. The TA outputs will be publicized and \ndiscussed in journals, books, and seminars. The summarized policy recommendations will be \nsubmitted to high-level government policy makers, including the State Council.  \n \n18.  TA funds will be used to engage two international consultants for 9 person-months and \nfive national consultants for 98 person-months. The outline terms of reference for consultants is \nin Appendix 3. Consultants will be selected on an individual basis and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nEquipment (notebook computers, facsimile machines, and photocopiers) will be procured by the \nEAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe consultants will submit (i) an inception report 4 weeks after their services start, (ii) interim \nprogress reports at appropriate stages of TA implementation, (iii) a draft final report, and (iv) a \nfinal report 2 weeks after incorporating the EA\u2019s and ADB\u2019s comments.  \n \nIV.
