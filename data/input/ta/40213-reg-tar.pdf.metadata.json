At  that  time,  overdependence  on  bank  financing  had  forced \nborrowers to take on excessive short-term foreign exchange exposure to finance long-term \nprojects generating local currency revenues. This created two mismatch problems: (i) loan \nmaturities became too divergent, to the detriment of both local creditors and borrowers; and \n(ii) the currencies in which the loans were made became vulnerable to exchange rate volatility, \nin particular local currency exchange rate depreciation. When international confidence in one \nlocal currency caused a rapid depreciation against the United States dollar, a payments crisis \nensued, exacerbating the loss in confidence across the region (the so-called \u201ccontagion\u201d effect). \nThis led to banking and currency crises in several countries of the region. With improved global \nmacroeconomic conditions in recent years and the structural reforms implemented throughout \nthe region, most crisis-affected economies recovered and have returned to robust growth. The \nlack of efficient bond markets in the region remains, however, and so the absence of alternative \nsources of long-term local currency finance continues to be a source of financial vulnerability. \n \n2.  Although  domestic  bond  markets  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations \n(ASEAN)+31 region have been growing rapidly, most countries still do not have very highly \ndeveloped bond markets.2 Size, turnover, transparency, and variety of issuers and maturities \nremain  key  challenges  for  bond  market  development  in  the  region.  Furthermore,  most \nimpediments to the development of domestic bond markets in ASEAN+3, such as lengthy \napproval processes, unsupportive legal and regulatory frameworks, lack of hedging instruments, \nand poor disclosure standards, are problems related to financial infrastructure. Thus, it is only \nproper for policymakers and regulators in the region to deepen their understanding of the bond \nmarket and the policy framework, as well as to improve their capacities for addressing these \nimpediments in infrastructure and related policy issues.  \n \n3.  In line with the ongoing support extended by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in ASEAN+3 in promoting bond market development, it is \nrecommended that efforts include a forward-looking assessment of the need for human capacity \nbuilding and development in the region\u2019s bond markets. Skilled and trained policymakers are \ncritical to ensure the region\u2019s ability to formulate policies and implement programs that will \npromote sustainable development of more sophisticated and developed bond markets. It is also \nrecognized that, as a result of the region\u2019s diversity in stages of financial development, there is \ncurrently an imbalance in the availability of trained and experienced financial professionals in \ngovernment agencies and regulators in some ASEAN+3 countries.  \n \n4.  The President, under ADB\u2019s 3-year knowledge products and services (KPS) work plan \n2006\u20132008,3 approved the technical assistance (TA) concept clearance on 28 April 20064 to \naddress this need. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3 comprises the 10 members of the ASEAN (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam), People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n2  In the April 2007 issue of the Asia Bond Monitor, total local currency bonds outstanding in ASEAN+3 (excluding \nJapan but including Hong Kong, China) grew from $400 billion equivalent in 1997 to $2,840 billion equivalent as of \nend-2006, or  from 11.5% to 61.5% of  GDP. However, local currency  bond markets in this region remain \ninsignificant at around 7% of total local currency bonds worldwide. Market liquidity, measured by trading volume \nand turnover ratios, has risen in recent years but remains relatively small as compared with markets from \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. \n3  ADB. 2005. Three-Year ADB-wide KPS Work Plan 2006\u20132008. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 September 2007. \n ", "2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  Establishing an efficient domestic bond market infrastructure5 is indispensable to the \ndevelopment of bond markets in the region. The ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative6 has \nalready contributed to the development of the region\u2019s bond market infrastructure. In order to \nencourage greater market participation from bond issuers, institutional and individual investors, \nand intermediaries (securities companies and stock exchanges, among others), however, it is \nvital that policymakers thoroughly understand bond markets in order to formulate or adopt \npolicies conducive for bond market development. \n \n6.  Globalization and Asian financial integration, together with the rapidly changing financial \nmarket  structures,  are  developments  that  have  fundamentally  changed  the  needs  and \nchallenges  of  the  financial  markets  in  the  region.  As  a  result,  market  players  as  well  as \npolicymakers require close monitoring of these changes, and regular training on bond markets \nwould aid in promoting efficient bond markets in the region. \n7.  The rapid turnover of government officials in ASEAN+3 countries is not helping the \ncause of efficiently developing the region\u2019s bond markets, given the transition time required to \nbring new officials up to date on existing policy initiatives and reform programs. There is also the \npossibility of discontinued policy reforms if the transition process is not smooth. To bridge the \ngap  on  the  transfer  of  knowledge  between  officials,  continuous  training  is  needed  for \npolicymakers, and particularly for those who have recently taken up new positions. \n \n8.  ADB's  Office  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  (OREI)  has  implemented  numerous \ncapacity  building  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  projects  for  economic  surveillance, \nregional economic and financial monitoring, negotiating free trade agreements, operating early \nwarning systems for detecting financial vulnerabilities, training financial sector regulators, and \nstrengthening  credit  rating  agencies.7 To  date,  however,  OREI  has  not  been  extensively \ninvolved in capacity building efforts specific to bond market development. The proposed TA will \ncontinue ADB\u2019s support in developing regional bond markets. ADB has accumulated extensive \nexperience in bond market development that promotes regional cooperation by working closely \nwith DMCs to promote structural reform of their financial sectors. In many instances, OREI\u2019s \nfinancial  market  development  initiatives  have  required  RETAs  for  appropriate  knowledge \ntransfer complementing ADB\u2019s research initiatives, particularly for bond market development. \nThis RETA falls under OREI\u2019s key result area 2 for supporting capacity building and institutional \nstrengthening and key result area 5 for developing partnerships with other stakeholders. \n \n9.  Given  the  rapidly  expanding  economic  interdependence  and  financial  cooperation \namong ASEAN+3 countries, the scope has greatly increased for dialogue and coordination \nacross the region among such institutions as finance ministries, central banks, financial services \nauthorities, and  securities  and  exchange  commissions.  OREI  continues  to  receive  positive \nfeedback from training participants, who generally view the training programs conducted by \nOREI as very useful in upgrading their knowledge on targeted issues for the benefit of their \n                                                 \n5  Some examples of market infrastructure are clearing and settlement systems; depository infrastructure; trading \nplatforms; accounting, tax, and legal systems; rating agencies; and risk management facilities. \n6  The ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative, which was endorsed at the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers Meeting in \nManila, Philippines on 7 August 2003, aims to develop efficient and liquid bond markets in Asia, enabling better \nutilization of Asian savings for Asian investments. It would also contribute to the mitigation of currency and maturity \nmismatches in financing. \n7  Please refer to Appendix 4 for the complete list of RETA projects on capacity building by OREI. \n ", "  3\nhome countries and the region generally. Interaction and networking among individuals and \nregional institutions is another benefit, as course participants share knowledge on relevant \ntechnical  issues.  Establishing  effective  and  close  interpersonal  relationships  through  the \nsupportive  alumni  network  also  promotes  an  environment  for  more  effective  regional \ncooperation. In addition, OREI has received requests and proposals from various institutions to \njointly provide specialized training programs and seminars on bond market development.8 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The overall goal of the TA is to promote an efficient bond market in the region, as this \nwill  contribute  to  stable  financial  markets  and  sustained  economic  growth  in  ASEAN+3. \nFurthermore, bond markets play an important role in mobilizing capital for investments that are \ncritical to economic development. This goal can be achieved by enhancing the capacity of \nofficials from policy making institutions and supervisory agencies (such as ministries of finance, \ncentral  banks,  financial  services  authorities,  and  securities  and  exchange  commissions)  of \nDMCs in ASEAN+3 to promote appropriate policy measures for bond market development. This \nTA will not only provide policy makers with a deeper understanding of bond market regulatory \nand supervisory best practices, but, by its equipping them with an extensive knowledge of how \nbond markets function, the participants will know better what are the appropriate actions to take \n(whether preventive or corrective) under varying market conditions.  \n \n11.  The TA aims to design and provide training courses and/or programs for bond market \ndevelopment to enhance the knowledge and skills of capital market regulatory agencies9. It also \naims to provide a venue for regional policy dialogues and cross-country consultations on bond \nmarket development issues. The expected outcome is for ASEAN+3 officials to become more \neffective in enacting policies on bond market development. \n \n12.  The TA complements efforts by OREI to (i) promote regional economic policy dialogue, \nand  (ii)  support  capacity  building  and  institutional  strengthening  in  the  area  of  regional \ncooperation  and  integration.  These  training  programs  and  course  modules  will  enable \nparticipants  to  share  experiences  and  explore  appropriate  policy  measures  for  developing \nefficient domestic bond markets. The training program will cover ASEAN+3 member countries \nexcept Japan, Republic of Korea, and Singapore. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Training Program Design  \n \n13.  The  aim  of  the  training  is  to  assist  financial  regulators  in  making  strategic  policy \ndecisions in directing bond market development, including to identify barriers that restrict market \nefficiency and liquidity. The training program will focus on action planning, a process that assists \ntrainees to formulate strategies to overcome impediments to bond market development. Two \ntraining programs will be developed under the TA. The first will be jointly organized with an \n                                                 \n8  Two recent requests for joint efforts are from the Japan International Cooperation Agency in Tokyo, Japan, and the \nAsia-Pacific Finance and Development Center in Shanghai, People\u2019s Republic of China. \n9  The TA presently targets conducting of activities in Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China, \nIndonesia,  Japan,  Republic  of  Korea,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  Malaysia,  Philippines,  Singapore, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n ", "4   \nexternal institution;10 the second will be an ADB in-house training program fully administered \nand financed by ADB. A bond market training specialist, acting as team leader, will be engaged \nto design, conceptualize, and supervise implementation of the training course modules while \ncalling upon team members\u2019 extensive experience in bond market development. \n  2.  Training Programs and Dissemination of Case Studies \n \na.  Joint Training Program \n \n14.  This training program will be a joint effort between ADB and an external institution. The \nexternal institution will be in charge of all logistical and financial arrangements for training \nparticipants, including travel and accommodation as well as the administrative provisions in \ndelivering the training program. The venue of the training program should be agreed by both \norganizations. Training participants are expected to have the following minimum qualifications: (i) \na bachelor\u2019s degree (or equivalent) in economics or finance from a recognized university, and \npreferably  a  postgraduate  qualification  in  the  same  field;  (ii)  at  least  7  years  of  relevant \nprofessional  work  experience,  with  a  strong  background  in  bond  market  or  capital  market \ndevelopment; (iii) fluency in written and spoken English; and (iv) currently working in planning \nfor bond market development in a ministry of finance, central bank, financial services authority, \nor securities and exchange commission at a middle-management level. \n \n15.  The core program will be a 2-week training course on bond market development. This \nwill involve about 20 middle-management officials from DMCs in ASEAN+3 each year for the \nfirst 2 years of the TA implementation. This course will focus on developing an understanding of \nthe necessary building blocks for the development of efficient and liquid bond markets in the \nregion,  such  as  a  facilitative  approval  process,  sound  legal  and  regulatory  frameworks, \navailability of hedging mechanisms, and good disclosure standards.  \n \n  b.  ADB In-House Training Program \n \n16.  During the final year of the TA implementation, an in-house training program of at least 2 \nweeks  on  bond  market  development  will  be  implemented.  The  program  will  be  at  ADB \nheadquarters and will be offered to public organizations in ASEAN+3 DMCs that intend to \ndevelop sound and active bond markets. Participants shall have opportunities to identify issues \nand impediments to bond market development in their countries and to share knowledge with \none another. About 25 individuals will participate in this training program. ADB will be in charge \nof  all  logistical  and  financial  arrangements  for  training  participants,  including  travel  and \naccommodation as well as the delivery of the training program. ADB staff, consultants, and \nresource persons will deliver the modules of the program in partnership with relevant regional \nresearch centers.  \n \n  c.  Publication and Dissemination of Case Studies \n \n17.  During the second year of the TA implementation, a book of case studies on bond \nmarket development in ASEAN+3 will be published. The bond market specialist will be engaged \nto recommend topics for case studies (one case per module) to be covered in the publication \nbased on a needs assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and to supervise the overall publication, \nincluding to write some sections. These topics will be supplemented with a case study from \n                                                 \n10 For the first training program, Japan International Cooperation Agency has expressed its interest to co-organize the \nprogram with ADB in 2008. \n ", "  5\neach country participant at the first joint training program, based on issues the participants faced, \npolicy actions taken, and results obtained. These should highlight real life cases and lessons \nlearned that could possibly be put into practice. The case studies will be disseminated via the \nAsianBondsOnline  website.11 This  is  consistent  with  the  website\u2019s  objective  of  improving \ninformation  flows  on  Asian  bond  markets.  The  improved  flows  will  help  to  increase  the \ntransparency, liquidity, efficiency, credibility, and depth of bond markets in the region; lower \nfunding costs for Asian bond issuers; and facilitate cross-border capital flows. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.   The TA is estimated at the equivalent of $500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility12 and administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates \nand financing plans are in Appendix 2.13 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.   ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. OREI will administer the TA and supervise \nthe work of the TA consultants. The joint training program will be jointly organized with external \ninstitutions. The roles of external institutions will be negotiated and determined on a case-by-\ncase basis and will be documented by a memorandum of understanding for each arrangement. \n \n20.   Two international consultants (a bond market training specialist and team leader plus a \nbond market specialist) will be hired for a total of 10 person-months. Two national consultants \n(one financial market analyst and one training coordinator) will be selected for a total of 15 \nperson-months. Ten bond market experts will be engaged as resource persons to speak at the \ntraining program. The consultants will be hired and engaged by ADB as individual consultants in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n21.   The TA will be implemented over a period of 32 months. It is expected to begin in April \n2008 and be completed by November 2010. The key activities of the TA are three training \nprograms, including an ADB in-house training program, and publication of case studies. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.
