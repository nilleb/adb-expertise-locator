INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2011  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a technical \nassistance (TA) for Credit and Social Rating System Development for Microcredit Companies \n(MCCs), starting with arrangements in Heilongjiang province.1 The April 2012 mission confirmed \nthe  strong  commitment  of  the  PRC  and  Heilongjiang  governments,  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the PRC government on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \n2.  The ADB country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC includes inclusive growth \nas its first pillar, also a core value of the PRC\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015. Improving \naccess to finance and management of natural resources are the two main areas of support. The \nTA directly supports inclusive growth by providing better information on microcredit company \n(MCC) operations and their financial and social impacts. Ratings will also help policy makers \nunderstand and improve rules to increase financial access. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The PRC\u2019s outstanding economic performance3 is accompanied by a number of serious \nimbalances\u2014between coastal and inland regions, between urban and rural areas, and between \nhigh  demand  for  natural  resources  and  the  need  for  energy  efficiency  and  environmental \nconservation. The government and ADB consider the development of inclusive finance to be a \nkey  policy  measure to achieve  inclusive  growth.4 The  PRC  banking  system  has  played  a \ndominant role in the financial market by mobilizing a large pool of deposits and providing an \nestimated 95% of corporate financing. However, many small and medium-sized enterprises and \npoor households are confronted by serious difficulties in accessing credit.5   \n \n4.  In  2004,  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China  (PBC)  decided  to  open  the  financial  market  to \nmicrocredit operations. That same year, ADB provided TA to support establishment of private \nsector-sponsored microfinance institutions.6 The first seven MCCs began operation in late 2006; \nthe market has continued to grow exponentially. The latest PBC statistics indicate that as of  \n31 March 2012, 4,878 MCCs, with 53,501 employees, were operating in the country. They had \na  total  loan  balance  of  CNY444.7  billion  and  total  paid-in  capital  of  CNY387.1  billion. \nHeilongjiang  province,  the  proponent  for  this  TA,  has  317  registered  MCCs  covering  all \nmunicipalities and 80% of counties. The companies serve 69,000 business clients and have \ntotal registered capital of CNY9.68 billion. They are regulated in a nonprudential manner by the \nHeilongjiang Provincial Office of Financial Affairs. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2012\u20132014. \nManila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 December 2012.  \n3  Real gross domestic product growth for 2011 was 9.2% and inflation 4.1%. Foreign direct investment reached an \nall-time high of $115.86 billion in 2011. \n4  An inclusive financial system is one that services all clients, not just the relatively well off. This means servicing \npoor and low-income clients with a wide range of accessible products. \n5  This is due to unreliable financial reporting, lack of collateral and guarantees, lack of credit-rating and general \ncredit information, and loan officer responsibility for loan losses. \n6  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Rural Finance Reforms and Development \nof Microfinance Institutions. Manila (TA 4430-PRC, for $1,000,000, approved on 9 November 2004). \n ", "2   \n5.  Increasing  resources  to  MCCs  and  their  borrowers  will  encourage  private  sector \nparticipation  in  economic  growth,  creating  more  employment  opportunities  and  increased \nincome.  Additionally,  access  to  microcredit  and  other  financial  services  helps  the  poor  to \nimprove incomes and withstand economic shocks. ADB has continuously supported the rural \nand microfinance subsectors in the PRC. In addition to its groundbreaking work in 2004 to \ndevelop  privately  owned  commercially  sustainable  microfinance  institutions,  ADB  is  now \npartnering with (i) PBC to support innovations in rural and microfinance, and improve rural \nfinance statistics; (ii) the China Banking Regulatory Commission to strengthen the rural finance \nregulatory framework; and (iii) local banks to channel funds to MCCs and the microfinance \nmarket through wholesale funding facilities. \n \n6.  The Heilongjiang provincial government views MCCs as significant for increasing of jobs \nand legalization of enterprises. Key issues for MCCs include sensitivity to rapid changes in \nmarket demand for funds, and higher taxation and more challenging policy environments than \nfor  other  financial  institutions.  Other  TA  projects  and  ongoing  consultations  with  PBC  are \naddressing these issues. MCCs are limited by the size of their capital base and geographic \ncoverage (only one county each) and are primarily financed by owners\u2019 equity investments. \nMost MCCs deploy their entire capital base in 2\u20133 months and have to depend on recycling of \nfunds. Loans to MCC clients are usually 3\u20136 months in duration and finance the working capital \nneeds of their clients. MCC borrowing from commercial banks is severely limited, as banks are \nwary of the unrated financial firms, which are relatively young and not fully regulated. Investors \nare equally hesitant about placing equity into MCCs, as they are uncertain of the quality of \noperations, assets, and management. Independent ratings of MCCs would significantly improve  \nequity investments and lending capacity.  \n \n7.  While an initial credit-rating arrangement for MCCs is being considered and developed \nunder a small grant from the Gender and Development Fund, no market-established system of \nrating firms is available to provide assessments of MCCs on financial and social performance. \nPrivate rating firms have not entered this market due to the relatively recent development of \nMCCs and uncertainty if firms will pay for the ratings. The lack of comparative information on \nMCCs has resulted in severe restrictions on lending and equity investments in many MCCs. \nHeilongjiang  provincial  government  has  proposed  this  arrangement  to  strengthen  its  MCC \nmarket. \n \n8.  The  development  of  competitive  ratings  for  the  MCC  market  is  important  for  three \nreasons.  First,  regulation  is  decentralized  to  the  provinces,  and  rating  systems  will  help \nregulators track the development and performance independent of their own oversight. Second, \nthe MCC market is constrained by limitations on capital and restrictive borrowing, and ratings \nwill  help  strengthen  MCCs  to  attract funds to  grow  and  engage  with  banks  as  wholesale \nfinanciers. Third, establishment of a system of financial and social performance ratings will help \nthe PRC government determine the social impact of MCCs, and the national and provincial \ngovernments to develop policies to encourage and promote MCCs, which provide financial \nsupport to lower-income households and encourage rebalancing of resources. In this way, the \nPRC can build appropriate systems to support their financial and social benefits. \n \n \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved investment quality of MCCs in the PRC. The outcome will \nbe a competitive market for social and financial performance ratings for MCCs in Heilongjiang \nprovince. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will help develop financial and social performance rating systems for MCCs in \nthe PRC, starting with arrangements in Heilongjiang province. Three rating firms will be selected \nbased on international and local rating experiences in microfinance markets. The three selected \nfirms will develop dual financial and social credit ratings for MCCs, and work with provincial \nregulators to help them understand the rationale, systems, and use of the ratings. The rating \nfees for the initial set of MCCs will be covered by the TA, and banks and MCC investors will be \nprovided with information on how ratings can be used for MCC engagement.  \n \n11.  The TA will deliver three major outputs, with following activities:  \n \n(i)  Three rating firms with social and financial rating systems for microcredit \ncompanies. The TA will (a) review international best practice in financial and \nsocial performance ratings for MCCs, (b) determine methodology for rating MCCs, \nand (c) develop selection criteria for candidate rating firms in close collaboration \nwith EA/IA. Experienced and capable ratings agencies will join the TA to develop \nthe social and financial rating system. \n(ii)  Fifteen microcredit companies with social and financial ratings. The TA will \n(a) identify and select candidate MCCs for the social and financial ratings based \non  predetermined  criteria,  which  will  be  developed  in  more  detail  with  the \ngovernment; (b) test the rating systems with candidate MCCs and revise and \nupdate the system based on the results; and (c) share overall process, results \nand implications with the provincial regulators. The final output will be 15 MCCs \nwith social and financial ratings based on the established rating methodology and \nsystem well responsive to the potential demand in MCCs ratings in Heilongjiang \nProvince. \n(iii)  Rating firms approved by provincial regulators in Heilongjiang province for \nrating  microcredit  companies.  The  TA  will  (a)  reflect  views  and \nrecommendations  of  all  interested  stakeholders,  including  provincial  finance \nbureaus, PBC, the women\u2019s federation, and others; (b) improve the existing data \nreporting formats for the rating system; and (c) develop criteria for the provincial \nregulator\u2019s approval of rating firms for MCCs. The provincial financial market \noffices will determine rating firms acceptable for MCC ratings. \n \n12.  Heilongjiang Provincial Finance Department, the executing agency, and the Heilongjiang \nProvincial Office of Financial Affairs, the implementing agency, will select MCCs to be rated \nusing the following criteria: the five largest MCCs by loan portfolio, the five MCCs with the \nlowest average loan size, and the next five oldest MCCs. In this way the market will be reviewed \nin terms of largest organizations that have market impact, those with the likely highest social \nagenda (as those providing smaller loans are targeting poorer clients), and MCCs with the \nlongest operating history. \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of data access, office space, logistics support, and other \nin-kind contributions. Appendix 2 provides the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Finance  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency  (EA)  and \nHeilongjiang Provincial Office of Financial Affairs will be the implementing agency (IA). \n \n15.  The TA will commence on 1 February 2013 and close on 31 May 2015. It will finance  \n(i)  three  lump  sum  contracts  for  consultants  to  support  rating  companies  (an  estimated \nequivalent  of  15  person-months  of  blended  international  and  national  consultant  time)  to \ndevelop and test rating systems; and (ii) training, workshops, and miscellaneous expenses. \nThree firms will be contracted to develop ratings under the consultants qualification selection \nmethod with a ceiling of $100,000 per firm, based on recent prior cost experience developing \nratings for MCCs under the Gender and Development Fund. The rating companies will also \nprovide training to regulators on the results; this cost is separate in the budget and will be paid \nfrom  the  TA  by  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Finance  Department  under  advance  payment \nfacilities. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference are provided in \nAppendix 3. \n \n16.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010 as amended from time to time). An assessment of Heilongjiang \nFinance Bureau capacity will not be undertaken as the bureau has implemented previous ADB \nprojects and its expenditure will be limited to paying for site costs of training activities under \nadvance payment facilities. \n \n17.  ADB and the Heilongjiang Provincial Finance Department will review TA operations in \nthe field three times a year. Market reporting of ratings in the public domain will demonstrate the \nresults.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China for  Credit  and  Social  Rating  System \nDevelopment for Microcredit Companies, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets \nand Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved investment  Lending and  PBC summary of  Rated MCCs will \nquality in microcredit  investments in rated  provincial financial market  attract more \ncompanies  MCCs are 10% higher  office data, website  investment  \nthan in the general   \nMCC market by 2017  PBC will provide \n  incentives to rated \nMCCs with high \nsocial ratings \nOutcome      Assumption \nCompetitive market for  MCC social and  Published MCC ratings  Rating companies will \nsocial and financial  financial performance  data, PRC rating  charge market-based \nperformance ratings for  ratings provided in  companies  rating fee  \nMCCs   Heilongjiang province     \nby at least two rating     \nfirms by the end of   \n2015 (baseline 2012:   \nnone)   \n  Published MCC data, \n25 MCCs rated by the  provincial financial market \nend of 2015 (baseline  bureaus, MCC websites \n2012: none)   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
