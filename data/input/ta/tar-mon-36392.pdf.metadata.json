The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to help develop a strategy to guide the Government\u2019s and the ADB\u2019s \nfuture cooperation and joint programs in the urban development and housing sector. This TA is \nincluded  in  the  Mongolia  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  2004\u20132006,1  and  is \nprogrammed  for  2004.2  Fact-finding  for  the  TA  was  undertaken  in  April\u2013May  2004  and \nagreement was reached with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements,  cost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia experienced rapid urbanization in the second half of the 20th century and this \ntrend  was  accelerated  during  the  transition  from  a  centrally  planned  to  a  market-based \neconomy. By 2000, the urban population was 1.4 million, equivalent to 58% of the national \npopulation of 2.4 million. More than half of the urban population live in Ulaanbaatar, while 10% \nlive in Darhan and Erdenet. The remaining 40% live in 18 provincial (aimag) capitals with \naverage populations of 22,000.3 Provincial capitals function primarily as the administrative and \nservice centers for rural population with densities varying widely but averaging less than one \nperson per square kilometer and spread over an area half the size of India. Each province is \ndivided into about 20 districts (soums), which are further subdivided into 4\u20136 bags (the smallest \nadministrative unit), with 50 to 100 families in each. There are currently 340 urban and rural \ndistricts and 1,634 bags. \n \n3.  Under socialist planning, apartment areas were separated from ger (traditional tent) \nareas, and this is still sustained in every urban area in Mongolia. The apartment areas are \nserved by electricity; piped and hot water; sewerage; central heating; solid waste collection; and \na  full  range  of  education,  health,  social,  and  commercial  facilities.  However,  services  are \nminimal in the ger areas, which are characterized by individual fenced plots with gers and/or \nsmall shelters. Water tankers supply neighborhood water kiosks; sanitation facilities are on-plot \npit  latrines;  and  coal,  wood,  or  dung-fired  stoves  are  used  for  heating  and  cooking.  The \nseparation of the two areas has contributed to the development of urban areas with extensive \nunused open space and low densities, making service delivery more costly. This is especially so \nfor the ger areas, which are on the urban periphery in most cities and towns. Thus, households \nin the ger areas pay significantly more for heating, water, and solid waste disposal than those in \napartment areas. Since water in ger areas costs up to 20 times as much per liter as water \nsupplied to apartment residents, water consumption in the ger areas is low, typically 6\u201312 liters \nper capita per day.4 Over half the population of Ulaanbaatar and at least half of the population of \nthe provincial capitals live in the ger areas. \n \n4.  Urban infrastructure and services are seriously dilapidated and in urgent need of repair \nand improvement. Mongolia had developed basic infrastructure and services in urban areas with \nfinancial assistance from the former Soviet Union. The program stopped when the former Soviet \nUnion collapsed. Many urban areas ended up with incompletely installed infrastructure and \nservices. At the end of 2000, 40% of the urban population had access to piped water, 39% to \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

Lack of funds for regular maintenance \nand periodic rehabilitation has led to a serious deterioration in urban infrastructure and services. \n \n5.  About 35% of the national population are poor, living below a weighted national poverty \nline of about $17 per person per month, half the international norm of $1 per day. People living \nin Ulaanbaatar are marginally poorer (34% fall below the poverty line) than those living in rural \nareas (33% below the poverty line). However, those living in provincial capitals are the poorest, \nwith 45% below poverty line. At the same time, the average monthly income of households \nliving in the ger areas is less than 70% of that of households living in the apartment areas.5 The \npoverty reduction programs and measurement should be targeted at the ger areas, and the \nimbalances in the provision of infrastructure and services between the apartment areas and the \nger areas need to be redressed. \n \n6.  The parliament of Mongolia approved the Regional Development Concept (RDC) in June \n2001 (Resolution No. 57). The objectives of the RDC are to (i) create a favorable environment \nfor narrowing the disparities in urban and rural development within regions; (ii) accelerate \neconomic growth; and (iii) support social progress through utilization of natural, agricultural, and \ncrop-originated resources in line with the capabilities of the particular regions, leading to the \ndecentralization of population concentration. Based on the RDC, eight pillar centers6 were \nidentified as regional administrative centers and development nodes. About MNT500 million \nwas allocated to develop a general plan for each of the pillar centers. The general plan will \ncomprise (i) plans for the background, structure, functions, and optimal size of the pillar center; \nand (ii) drawing plans for engineering, construction, territorial, and land specifications. The plans \nare to be completed by July 2004. \n \n7.  ADB has assisted the urban development and housing sector through loan and grant \nprojects  for  basic  urban  services  improvements  in  the  provincial  capitals,  housing  sector \nfinance,  living  environment  improvement  in  the  ger  areas,  cadastral  survey  and  land \nregistration, and a TA project on regional development planning.7 ADB has been one of the \nmain sources of external assistance for the sector. The World Bank has recently approved the \nSecond Ulaanbaatar Services Improvement Project. The objective of the project is to improve \nthe quality of life of the urban poor in the ger areas of Ulaanbaatar by providing basic urban \nservices\u2014water supply, sanitation, drainage, laundry and bath houses, and access roads and \npathways\u2014in a sustainable manner. The World Bank, in cooperation with the City Alliance, is \nalso developing the City Development Strategies in Darhan and Erdenet. The City Development \nStrategies  is  a  dynamic  process  that  facilitates  the  engagement  and  commitment  of  the \ncommunities and key stakeholders to define their problems and opportunities as a city, to \n                                                 \n5  National Statistical Office of Mongolia and United Nations Development Programme. 1999.

Among  other  agencies,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency, United Nations Development Programme, and United States Agency for International \nDevelopment are active in the sector. Ongoing external assistance to the urban development \nand  housing  sector  is  summarized  in  Appendix  2.  Major  interventions  are  focusing  on \nUlaanbaatar, and assistance to other cities is limited in scale. The TA is needed to undertake \ncomprehensive analysis on the urban development housing conditions of the country. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s urban sector profile for Mongolia was prepared in 1999. Given high rural-to-urban \nmigration and rapid growth of Ulaanbaatar, the rapid growth of the urban informal economy, \nchanges in investment and employment patterns, and revised Government priorities that are \nreflected in several new laws,8 ADB\u2019s approach to the urban development and housing sector \nneeds  revision.  The  TA  will  review  the  recent  developments,  review  priority  sectoral  and \ngeographical needs and areas of focus, and identify future directions for ADB\u2019s strategy and \nprogram in urban development and housing to maximize its impact on the sector. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The overall goal of the TA is to help increase understanding and capability to plan and \nimplement ADB\u2019s TA and lending programs for the urban development and housing sector in \nMongolia for 2005\u20132008.9 The TA will serve to facilitate economic growth in urban areas while \nenhancing the access of the poor to urban services and sustaining the environment. \n \n10.  The principal outputs will be (i) updated basic information in urban development and \nhousing, (ii) an urban development and housing sector strategy for ADB for 2005\u20132008, and (iii) \noutline proposals of priority investments and institutional capacity development requirements. \nThe process and approach of the TA are also expected to help the Government increase \nawareness of issues, constraints, and opportunities in the sector. The results of the TA will be \nfully incorporated in the country strategy and program for Mongolia, which is being prepared. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will use the available sector study results, and focus on identifying concrete \nmeasures  that  can  readily  be  implemented,  through  consultations  with  concerned  key \ngovernment  officials  and  other  stakeholders.  Such  consultations  will  be  participated  in  by \nacademic institutions, dwellers\u2019 representatives, and civil society organizations. \n \n1.  Updated Basic Information in Urban Development and Housing \n12.  The TA will include a comprehensive assessment of the urban situation, covering (i) \nnational population growth, rural-to-urban migration, and urbanization trends in the context of \nnational economic trends; (ii) recent changes in economic conditions in urban areas; (iii) urban \nemployment patterns and opportunities; (iv) the potential growth of industrial and commercial \nactivities in urban areas; (v) social and economic linkage between rural and urban areas; (vi) \nspatial and environmental conditions, and urban settlement patterns; (vii) the condition of urban \ninfrastructure including water supply, sanitation, heating and hot water supply, solid waste \n                                                 \n8 These include the Revised Urban Development Law, 2003; Housing Law, 1998; Land Privatization Law, 2002; and \nRegional Development Law, 2001. \n9 Urban areas studied under the TA will cover Ulaanbaatar, eight pillar centers, and provincial capitals. \n ", " 4  \nmanagement,  urban  roads,  and  public  transportation;  (viii)  land-use  patterns  and  housing \nconditions; (ix) urban poverty profile; (x) institutional relationship and responsibilities of the \ncentral and local government agencies; (xi) municipal finance and financing urban development;  \n(xii) regulations, procedures, and requirements of urban planning; (xiii) existing standards and \nnorms  related  to  urban  development  and  housing;  (xiv)  the  Government\u2019s  policies  and \ninvestment plans; (xv) progress in planning and implementing of the activities proposed under \nthe RDC; and (xvi) past, ongoing, and planned external assistance by other funding agencies in \nurban development and housing. Past and ongoing ADB loans and TAs in urban development \nand housing (footnote 7) will also be reviewed and specific lessons learned will be drawn.  \n \n13.  Based on the assessments, key sector issues and problems as well as opportunities for \ndevelopment will be determined and analyzed. Constraints to efficient urban service delivery \ndue to very low population density, severe pressure on urban infrastructure caused by heavy \nrural to urban migration, and difficulties in applying socialist planning systems and standards \nand norms inherited from the former Soviet Union to the current situation in Mongolia should be \npaid special attention. \n \n2.  Urban Development and Housing Sector Strategy \n14.  A framework will be developed providing clear directions for improving the institutional \nset-up  for  urban  development;  urban  planning,  management,  and  finance;  private  sector \nparticipation; poverty reduction; and environmental management. Future demands for urban \ninfrastructure and services will be estimated on the basis of population projections for major \nurban centers and for the whole country. Based on the framework, an urban development and \nhousing  sector  strategy  will  be  prepared.  The  strategy  will  guide  ADB\u2019s  TA  and  lending \nprograms  in  the  sector  for  2005\u20132008.  Priority  will  be  given  to  measures  to  reduce \nrural-to-urban migration, increase efficiency in urban services, maximize cities\u2019 contribution to \nthe national economic and social development, and improve living conditions in the ger areas in \na cost-effective manner. \n \n3.  Outline Proposal of Priority Investments \n15.  Priority  areas  of  investments  will  be  identified  through  assessing  the  needs  and \ndemands for urban infrastructure and services, and financial and institutional capabilities of the \nGovernment. Institutional capacity development requirements to realize such investments will \nalso be examined. Geographic scope (Ulaanbaatar as the capital or pillar centers identified \nunder the RDC or provincial capitals) and approach to be taken (integrated urban development \nor urban subsector development) will be identified for the priority investments. The TA will \nrecommend  further  steps  for  feasibility  work  for  the  priority  investments,  including  project \nlocation, objectives and rationale, major subsector focus, expected outputs, possible funding \nsources, time frame, and appropriate implementation arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $420,000 equivalent, of which $300,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $120,000 equivalent the local currency cost. ADB will finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $50,000 equivalent in local currency cost, totaling $350,000 \nequivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment will fund the remaining $70,000 equivalent for office accommodation, utilities, local \ncommunications, administrative support, and counterpart staff. Equipment and materials to be \n ", "      5\nfinanced  by  the  TA  will  be  procured  by  the  consultants.10  Detailed  cost  estimates  and  a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Ministry of Infrastructure will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will provide \npolicy guidance, facilitate interagency coordination, and resolve any institutional problems. The \nGovernment Implementing Agency for Construction, Urban Development and Public Utilities will \nbe the implementing Agency for the TA and will oversee the day-to-day implementation of the \nTA. It will appoint a senior officer as a TA manager, assisted by other qualified counterpart staff. \n \n18.  The TA will require 10 person-months of international and 9 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services. The international consultants will include an urban development specialist \nand team leader (4 person-months), an urban infrastructure specialist (3 person-months), and a \nmunicipal and housing finance specialist (3 person-months). The domestic consultants will \ninclude urban governance and management specialist (4 person-months), a social development \nspecialist (2 person-months), an environment  specialist (2 person-months), and a financial \nspecialist (1 person-month). All consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with \nthe Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A biodata \nproposal will be used to recruit consultants and the quality- and cost-based selection method \nwill be used for consultant selection. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 4. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 4 months, from August to December 2004. \nThe major reports required from the consultants are (i) an inception report describing the \ndetailed work program, by the end of the third week after the commencement of the TA; and (ii) \na draft final report, within 3.5 months after the commencement of the TA. Tripartite meetings will \nbe held with the Government, ADB, and the consultants to discuss the TA reports. A final report \nwill be submitted 2 weeks after receiving comments from the Government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Mongolia  for  Developing  an  Urban  Development  and  Housing  Sector \nStrategy, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n10  Equipment may include one desktop computer, laptop computer, printer, photocopy machine, and facsimile \nmachine.
