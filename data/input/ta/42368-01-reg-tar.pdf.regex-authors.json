INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since the late 1990s, a number of developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has experienced financial crises that have often severely disrupted \ninvestment and economic activity. The often significant costs of these crises have highlighted \nthe need to develop and analyze a set of financial soundness indicators (FSIs) that can help \npolicy makers identify the strengths and vulnerabilities in their countries' financial systems and \ntake preventive action to avert a crisis or at least minimize its effects. As the need for FSIs is \nreinforced by the current global economic turmoil originating in the subprime mortgage crisis in \nthe United States, FSIs can also provide an additional set of statistics with which potential \ninvestors  can  assess  the  investment  climate  in  DMCs  before  committing  to  investment \nstrategies and decisions. Higher investments in these countries will enhance economic growth \nand interregional trade. Moreover, financial sector development is one of the five core areas in \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.1 The development of high-quality and internationally comparable FSIs \nand their analysis in participating DMCs will help in monitoring the state of the finance sector in \nthem and in ensuring that efforts to develop the sector are effective.  \n \n2.  This  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  participating \nDMCs  to  strengthen  their  institutional  and  statistical  capacity  to  routinely  collect,  compile, \ndisseminate, and analyze internationally comparable FSIs. The compilation of FSIs will follow \nthe recommendations and guidelines in the Financial Soundness Indicators Compilation Guide \npublished by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).2 In conceptualizing the TA, discussions \nwere held with the IMF and within ADB on which DMCs to include and the appropriate way to \nplan the assistance to avoid any duplication of aid. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  FSIs4 register the current financial health and soundness of the financial institutions in a \ncountry, as well as of corporations and households. They include both aggregated data on \nindividual institutions and indicators that are representative of the markets in which the financial \ninstitutions operate. FSIs are computed and disseminated to support macro-prudential analysis, \nwhich  is  the  assessment  and  surveillance  of  the  strengths  and  vulnerabilities  of  financial \nsystems, with the aim of enhancing financial stability and policy making and, especially, of \nlimiting the likelihood of financial system failure. \n \n4.  The need for a set of FSIs to assess the strengths and weaknesses of financial systems \nhas intensified in recent years in view of the financial crises that have hit many developing \ncountries. Shortly after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, ADB helped central banks of selected \nDMCs to identify, compile, and interpret about 30 additional monetary and financial statistics \nand macro-prudential indicators in an attempt to prevent another crisis. This was followed by \nwork on early warning systems, with a prototype developed to detect region-wide economic and \nfinancial vulnerabilities among members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. Another TA project built on these \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2 IMF. 2006. Financial Soundness Indicators: Compilation Guide. Washington, DC. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010. \n4 Distinguished from financial conditions indexes, which measure financial shocks or shifts in financial conditions, that \ninfluence or predict future economic activity. \n ", "2  \ninitiatives by modifying the prototype into country-specific early warning systems that can be \noperated  by  government  agencies.  Another  project  aims  to  develop  an  FSI  database  for \nselected Asian developing economies.5 The TA complements these efforts and expands the \nresearch frontier through practical applications. \n \n5.  Policy makers and investors require information upon which to base their decisions. In \nthis period of globalization, however, currently available country-specific indicators constrain \ncross-country comparisons. To address this issue, the IMF has proposed a common set of \nstatistics described in the Financial Soundness Indicators Compilation Guide, which defines a \nlist of core FSIs to be compiled by countries and another list of encouraged FSIs (Appendix 2). \nThe guide provides information, recommendations, and advice on the conceptual framework; \nconcepts and definitions; and sources and techniques to use when compiling and disseminating \ncore and encouraged FSIs. It also defines the types of financial institutions, explains in detail \naccounting  rules  and  the  valuation  of  instruments,  and  provides  conceptual  advice  and \nguidance  on  individual  line  items  in  income  and  expenditure  accounts  and  balance  sheet \naccounts, from which the underlying series used to compute many FSIs can be obtained. \nConcepts of the preferred approaches to aggregation and consolidation are explained, and \ninformation is provided on how to develop the metadata to disseminate with the FSIs and \nenable users to make cross-country comparisons. In addition, as each country has its unique \nfinancial structure that affects the range of FSIs that may be computed and their assessment, \nthe guide outlines a list of structural indicators to be compiled in addition to the set of core and \nencouraged FSIs. The structural indicators provide some indication of the types of markets that \nexist in a country and their stage of development. \n \n6.  The guide notes that FSIs are a new body of economic statistics that arise from various \ninfluences and that compiling FSIs is likely to require relatively skilled staff in compiling agencies. \nAccordingly, the IMF conducted a coordinated compilation exercise (CCE) from 2004 to 2007 in \nwhich 62 participating countries developed their capacity to compile FSIs that are important to \nsurveilling  their  financial  systems,  promoting  the  cross-country  comparability  of  FSIs, \ncoordinating the efforts of national authorities to compile FSIs, and disseminating FSIs compiled \nduring the CCE, together with the detailed metadata, to improve transparency. The CCE was \nimplemented through a combination of technical advice and meetings. Participating countries \nwere requested to compile all the core FSIs and at least some of the encouraged ones using the \nstandard reporting forms prepared by the IMF. The IMF intends to conduct similar exercises in \nthe future, so the TA comes at a very opportune time, as it will enable ADB to learn from the \nvaluable lessons that emerged from the CCE and help it to coordinate with the IMF in terms of \nmodalities and scope of assistance to avoid duplication.  \n \n7.  The selection of recipient DMCs for this assistance rests on geographical diversity, \nrecipient country interest and level of economic and financial development, what the TA can \nachieve  given  its  funding  and  time  frame,  and  the  potential  for  complementarity  with  IMF \nefforts.6 The FSIs compiled in the four target DMCs under the TA will provide a common set of \nstatistics that can be used for comparison with those of other countries in their subregions that \n                                                 \n5 Respectively refers to: ADB. 1999.

The improved comparability arising from the use of this common set \nof statistics will help investors to better assess the investment climate and conditions in the four \ntarget DMCs. Any resultant increase in investments in these four DMCs will help to boost their \neconomic  development  and  integration  into  their  subregions  through,  for  example,  trade. \nMoreover, the higher degree of economic integration and faster economic growth which will be \nachieved in these three subregions may have other positive effects in the form of greater \ninterregional trade.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will help the four participating DMCs\u2013Bangladesh, Georgia, Sri Lanka, and Viet \nNam\u2013strengthen their institutional and statistical capacity to routinely collect, compile, analyze, \nand  disseminate  internationally  comparable  FSIs.  The  availability  of  better-quality  and \ninternationally comparable FSIs will help to improve the surveillance of financial systems in \nparticipating DMCs. The FSIs compiled and analyzed in participating DMCs are expected to be \nused in financial surveillance, assessment of the investment climate, and policy making.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be implemented through (i) consulting services; (ii) country consultations; (iii) \nsupport for data collection and compilation; (iv) in-country training; (v) workshops, seminars, and \nconferences; (vi) sector studies and data analysis; and (vii) knowledge dissemination. The \nscope of the TA surpasses the two objectives of the IMF CCE: core data compilation and \ndissemination. Where appropriate, ADB will coordinate with the IMF to streamline support for \nparticipating DMCs.8 The IMF will also be consulted when more complicated technical issues \narise during project implementation. \n \n10.  The TA will work with the lead agency nominated by the participating DMC as the FSI \ncountry coordinator. The lead agency in each participating DMC will coordinate with other \nagencies  in  collecting  and  compiling  FSIs  and  with  ADB  in  implementing  the  various \ncomponents of the TA. The lead agency will be responsible for (i) compiling time-series data on \nthe FSIs (and, where appropriate, structural indicators) and the underlying data series and \ndetailed metadata according to the guidelines and format of the IMF's reporting form for FSIs; (ii) \ncomputing and disseminating the FSIs; and (iii) sustaining the activity after TA completion. It will \nprepare an inventory of current practices in collecting, compiling, and disseminating FSIs and \nmake appropriate recommendations for improvements in consultation with ADB and the IMF. \n                                                 \n7 The four DMCs that have been consulted and have not yet participated in the IMF CCE are Bangladesh, Georgia, \nSri Lanka, and Viet Nam. The other countries that use the IMF FSIs framework include Armenia and Kazakhstan in \nCentral and West Asia; India in South Asia; and Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore in Southeast \nAsia.  \n8 Discussions with the IMF reveal that TA to countries will be similar to that provided during the CCE. Globally, the \nIMF will provide all countries with (i) standard FSI templates for use in reporting FSIs to the IMF, (ii) guidance on \nhow to complete the FSI templates, (iii) guidelines and assistance on how to use an internet-based integrated \ncorrespondence system developed by the IMF for reporting FSIs to the IMF, and (iv) training on methodology for \ncompiling FSIs and procedures for constructing specific FSIs. To resolve country-specific issues, IMF economists \ncorrespond via e-mail and telephone with FSI country coordinators and include FSI components in monetary \nstatistics missions to countries. The IMF will provide advice and recommendations if there is a need to develop or \nexplore new data sources for compiling FSIs. \n ", "4  \nThe lead agency will also prepare a compendium of FSIs based primarily on information that is \nalready available.9  \n \n11.  All the core FSIs should be computed for use in the analysis, together with as many of \nthe encouraged FSIs as can be computed. As far as possible, only existing data sources should \nbe used. It is preferable that no additional indicators be introduced, as the aim is to compile the \ncore and encouraged indicators and, where appropriate, the structural indicators in the IMF \nguide. However, if new sources must be explored to get data for missing core indicators, the TA \nwill support, to the extent possible within a reasonable time frame, the collection of additional \nbasic data. Limited equipment support will be provided for this activity as allowed in the current \nguidelines for the use of the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund.  \n \n12.  In each DMC, international consultants will prepare a handbook of methods for collecting \nand compiling FSIs that will incorporate information from the compendia. They will work with the \nlead agency in analyzing the results of the compilation to strengthen institutional capacity in the \ncountry. They will prepare working papers on the key findings of the TA and apply the findings \nto  improve  the  surveillance  of  the  financial  sector.  Studies  will  be  carried  out  to  better \nunderstand  national and regional finance sector issues affecting countries in the region that use \nFSIs to gauge the investment climate and facilitate policy making. The key outputs of the TA will \nbe the compendia of FSIs, handbook, working papers on data analysis, and financial sector \nassessments and investment climate studies. The common output of ADB and the IMF will be \nthe DMCs\u2019 FSI indicators, underlying data series, metadata, and inventory of current practices.  \n \n13.  The TA will support a number of workshops and in-country training programs.10 The first \nwill be an inception workshop to discuss activities and their timetable, the inventory of current \npractices in the compilation of FSIs in participating DMCs, a draft conceptual framework for the \ndevelopment of FSIs and compendia of them, the preparation of FSIs and underlying data \nseries and detailed metadata, and areas for analysis. Because the compilation of FSIs will likely \ninvolve  several  national  agencies,  in-country  training  workshops  will  be  organized  to  train \nagency staff on how to compile and calculate FSIs and the underlying metadata according to \nthe guide and the standard reporting forms to ensure that the agencies are able to collect the \ndata needed to compute the FSIs during the TA and after its completion.11  Workshops will \npromote the use and analysis of FSIs among policy makers and other data users and provide \nvenues to discuss the results of the studies. Toward the end of the TA, a concluding workshop \nwill discuss its results.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Investment Climate Facilitation Fund12 under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility and be administered by ADB. Appendix 3 provides cost estimates \nand the financing plan. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n                                                 \n9  If the lead agency does not have the highly specialized and technical skills necessary to successfully implement the \nTA, national consultants will be recruited for this task. \n10 The training programs will be conducted in the DMCs in addition to the IMF\u2019s global 2-week FSI courses held in \nIMF regional training centers.  \n11 Where appropriate, the IMF will be invited to send resource persons to participate in workshops, and the training \nwill be scheduled to coincide with IMF missions to the country. \n12 Established by the Government of Japan. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with the focal point being the Economics \nand Research Department's Office of the Chief Economist, which will also administer the budget \nfor  the  TA.  The  ADB  project  officer  will  implement  the  various  components  of  the  TA  in \nconsultation with participating DMCs and consultants. There will be regular communications \nwith the IMF to ensure no overlap of activities and, to the extent possible, that activities are \nsynchronized. \n \n16.  To  promote  ownership  of  the  data  production  and  ensure  its  sustainability,  the \nDevelopment Indicators and Policy Research Division will work with each lead agency under a \nmemorandum of understanding specifying the nature and scope of ADB's assistance and the \nobligations of the lead agency. The memorandum of understanding will be prepared and signed \nbefore the actual compilation of FSIs begins. \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months starting in January 2011. It will finance up to \n8 person-months of international consulting services and 15 person-months of national. The \nconsultancy requirements are (i) one international financial statistics consultant (2.00 person-\nmonths, intermittent); (ii) four international financial sector consultants (1.50 person-months \neach, intermittent); (iii) four national financial statistics consultants (3.25 person-months each, \nintermittent); (iii) one national copyediting consultant (1 person-month, intermittent); and (iv) one \nnational  graphic  design  consultant  (1  person-month,  intermittent).  Provision  for  resource \npersons, including ADB staff, is included. The TA is expected to be completed in December \n2013. \n \n18.  ADB will engage all consultants as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for \nconsultants  is  in  Appendix  4.  Procurement  will  be  undertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased using \nthe TA budget will be turned over to participating DMCs upon the completion of the TA.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented, supervised, and monitored following Investment Climate \nFacilitation Fund implementation and reporting guidelines. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for Strengthening Institutional Capacity to Compile \nand Analyze Financial Soundness Indicators for Investment Climate Assessment, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6         Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nand Indicators   Risks \nMechanisms \n \nImpact    Assumptions \n \nThe surveillance of the  FSIs are used regularly in  Publications and  Participating DMCs are \nfinance system in  financial surveillance and  reports of  committed to evidence-\nparticipating DMCs  policy decisions.  participating DMCs  based policy making \nand investment    and analysis. \n \nclimate assessment is \nInvestors use the FSIs \nimproved with the \nin investment decision \nregular supply of \nmaking. \ninternationally \n \ncomparable and \nbetter-quality data. \nOutcome      Assumption \nParticipating DMCs  At least two participating  Publications, reports,  Participating DMCs are \nenhance their  DMCs routinely collect,  and communications  willing to commit \ninstitutional and  compile, and disseminate  with participating  resources to routinely \nstatistical capacity to  FSIs in their publications  DMCs   compile and \nroutinely collect,  and/or on their websites.   disseminate FSIs and \ncompile, analyze, and  use them in analyses \n \ndisseminate  for policy making. \ninternationally \nRisk \ncomparable FSIs. \nStaff who are trained in \nthe work resign or are \ntransferred. \nOutputs     \nAssumptions \n1.
