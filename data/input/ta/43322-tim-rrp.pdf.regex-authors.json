Selection criteria have been set to \nensure that future subprojects comply with the project environmental \nclassification. An environmental assessment review procedure, which \nhas been prepared, will guide the environmental assessment of the \nsubprojects. \n   \nProject Description  The Project is sector-based in design. It will finance part of the medium-\nterm road network development program. At the end of the Project, \n(i) about 232 kilometers (km) of national roads will have been improved \nto maintainable condition; (ii) a road maintenance program (RMP) will \nhave been established; (iii) access roads and parking areas of cross-\nborder facilities will have been built at Mota Ain, Salele, Sakato, and \nOesilo; (iv) national contractors will have gained improved capacity to \nimplement roadworks; (v) the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) will have \nimproved its ability to administer road projects and the RMP; (vi) road \nsafety  awareness  in  the  project  areas  will  have  increased;  and \n(vii) climate-proofing measures will have become a regular part of road \ndesign and construction. \n \nThe selection of subproject roads to be rehabilitated will be guided by \nthe medium-term road network development program and based on the \nselection criteria and procedure agreed on by the Government and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). \n \nThe RMP will first be established under the Project in three pilot districts \nin  the  border  region\u2014Bobonaro,  Covalima,  and  Oecussi.  Midway \nthrough  project  implementation,  MOI  will  prepare  a  strategy  for \nexpanding the RMP to cover the entire road network. \n   \nRationale  A medium-term strategic planning exercise is under way to set the key \npriorities  for  the  country\u2019s  development  and  sustainable  economic \ngrowth.  Infrastructure  development  is  among  the  three  predefined \nmedium-term strategic objectives (the other two are poverty reduction \nand  private  sector  development),  and  roads  and  water  supply \ninfrastructure are a top priority for 2010. The Government has urged the ", "ii   \nline ministries and development partners to align their budgets with \nnational priorities. The development of road sector is widely recognized \nas  a  key  factor  in  creating  jobs,  promoting  private  sector  growth, \nincreasing agricultural productivity, and reducing poverty. \n \nWhile strategic planning by the Government is making progress, there \nis a need for better coordination with development partners. Working \ngroups  with  members  from  government  agencies  and  development \npartners  coordinate  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  annual \npriority  programs.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  set  up  the \nDirectorate for Aid Effectiveness for more transparent and harmonized \nexternal  aid  flows.  Budget  and  aid  information  is  circulated  at  the \nquarterly meetings of development partners, cochaired by the ministers \nof foreign affairs and finance. MOI also plans to meet regularly with \ndevelopment partners to coordinate the road sector development. \n \nThe Project will support the national priorities and development vision of \nTimor-Leste by establishing sound and sustainable road network, and it \nwill strengthen subregional cooperation with Indonesia by improving \nborder  post  facilities.  The  sector-based  approach  will  allow  the \nGovernment to lead in formulating and implementing its sector strategy \nand development partner coordination. MOI and its road agency, the \nDirectorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control (DRBFC), can thus \nimplement the Project in line with the Government\u2019s vision for road \nsector development, and more actively absorb the required knowledge \nand expertise. \n \nThe Project is also consistent with the reconciliation and stabilization \nstrategy adopted by the United Nations and the Government in the \naftermath of the conflict of 2006. With its comparative advantage in \ninfrastructure development, ADB has been asked by the Government to \nfacilitate  sustainable  socioeconomic  development  by  addressing \nphysical infrastructure constraints, particularly in the road sector.  \n   \nImpact and  The Project will support road sector development, leading to economic \nOutcome  growth and poverty reduction in the project areas. It is expected to \nmake socioeconomic facilities in the project areas more accessible and \ncross-border activities more efficient, reduce travel time and costs, and \nimprove planning and project implementation in the road sector. \n   \nProject Investment  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $52.90 million.  \nPlan  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Amount  Share of \nSource  ($ million)    Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank  46.00    86.96 \nGovernment  6.90    13.04 \n  Total    52.90    100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \n ", "  iii\nGrant Amount and  The Government has requested a grant of $46 million from ADB to help \nTerms  finance the Project. The Asian Development Fund grant will finance all \nforeign exchange cost, local cost for consulting services, equipment, \nproject management, 95% of cost of civil works for access roads and \nparking areas of border posts, 90% of the cost of civil works for the \nrehabilitation of about 232 km of national roads, and 70% of the cost of \ncivil works for road maintenance. Counterpart funds of $6.9 million from \nthe Government will cover 5% of the cost of civil works for access roads \nand parking areas of border posts, 10% of the cost of civil works for \nroad rehabilitation, 30% of the cost of civil works for road maintenance, \nand any taxes and duties, land acquisition and resettlement costs, and \nright-of-way costs. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  1 December 2009 to 31 May 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 November 2014 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  MOI  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  responsible  for  overall  project \nArrangements  management.  In  view  of  its  still-limited  capacity,  MOI  will  operate \nthrough  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  created  for  previous \nADB-funded road projects in the country. The PMU will take charge of \nday-to-day  project  management  and  provide  on-the-job  training  to \ncounterpart DRBFC staff. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Infrastructure \n   \nProcurement  All procurement under the Project will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). All contracts over \n$1 million  for  civil  works  and  $0.5 million  for  goods  will  undergo \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts below those amounts \nwill go through national competitive bidding (NCB) or, as appropriate for \nworks contracts up to $100,000, through shopping. \n   \nConsulting Services  A  consulting  firm  will  be  hired  under  the  Project  to  provide \n497 person-months  of  consulting  services  (141  international  and \n356 national)  for  (i) subproject  appraisal,  (ii) detailed  design,  (iii) bid \ndocument  preparation,  (iv) bidding  and  bid  evaluation  assistance, \n(v) construction  supervision,  and  (vi) project  performance  monitoring. \nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  through  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Financial audit consultants will \nbe hired through least-cost selection. \n \nThe Project will also finance the cost of project management. PMU staff \nwill  be  hired  individually  through  competitive  recruitment.  As  well-\nqualified national consultants are difficult to find in Timor-Leste, the \ncontracts  of  the  financial  administrator  (national)  and  the  road \nmaintenance  engineer  (national)  of  the  PMU  for  the  Road  Sector \nImprovement Project will be extended. \n   \n ", "iv   \nProject Benefits and  Improving access to markets can contribute to poverty reduction by \nBeneficiaries  increasing farming inputs. According to the June 2007 crop and food \nsupply assessment mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization \nand  the  World  Food  Programme  to  Timor-Leste,  38%\u201354%  of \nhouseholds suffer food shortages 3\u20135 months per year in most districts. \nThe road improvements will lead to increased marketing, and increased \nhousehold income. With improved access to local and regional markets \nand towns, farmers will be able to expand and diversify their agricultural \nproduction. People can get better prices for their products when they \nsell  at  larger  markets  or  directly  to  factories  rather  than  through \nmiddlemen.  \n \nBetter access to health facilities will improve the health of the people\u2014\nin  particular  women  and  children.  The  people  of  Timor-Leste  are \nvulnerable  to  respiratory  diseases,  diarrheal  malaria,  dengue  fever, \ntuberculosis, leprosy, and other treatable diseases. Improved access to \nhealth-care facilities will encourage people to seek medical assistance. \nBetter roads will also ease travel to schools, and help strengthen the \nschool  system  by  reducing  teacher  absentee  rates  and  enabling \nschools to attract more qualified teachers. \n \nIn Timor-Leste, sociocultural factors contribute to low enrollment and \nhigh dropout rates among female students, high illiteracy among adult \nfemales, high female unemployment, sex segregation in the paid labor \nforce, an emerging gender gap in wages, high maternal mortality, and \ndomestic violence. About 28% of women suffer from malnutrition; of \nthese, 7% are in need of treatment. The gender-specific benefits of the \nProject are (i) improved access to health-care facilities; (ii) improved \naccess  to  schools,  social  services,  and  other  key  facilities;  and \n(iii) targeted  employment  opportunities  for  female  laborers,  such  as \nbioengineering. \n   \nRisks and  The Project makes several assumptions and is subject to various risks, \nAssumptions  as follows: \n \nResurgence  of  conflict.  High  unemployment  and  high  poverty \nincidence are heightening the potential for instability. The Government \nis  pursuing  a  significant  reform  agenda  and  has  made  progress  in \naddressing  the  causes  and  consequences  of  the  2006  unrest. \nDisplaced people have returned, and the Government has introduced \nreforms in the security sector, addressed claims of discrimination raised \nby former soldiers, and made social transfer payments to vulnerable \ngroups. The police force is gradually resuming responsibility for law and \norder,  while  UN  police  and  international  forces  continue  to  bolster \nsecurity. \n \nLimited  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure. MOI has both \nhuman resource and budget constraints. The budget allocation for the \nroad sector in 2009 is only about $11 million, making the 6,000 km road \nnetwork severely underinvested. As the road agency, DRBFC has only \n12 engineers. The PMU under MOI will therefore be maintained and ", "  v\nstrengthened to oversee and administer day-to-day matters. ADB is \nalso implementing a TA to strengthen project management capacity \nand improve budget execution. \n \nLack of road maintenance financing. DRBFC used to rely on a road \nmaintenance management system developed under a JICA TA project \nfor road maintenance planning, but there has always been a shortage \nof  human  resources  and  funds  for  planned  road  maintenance.  The \nGovernment has given its assurance that it will gradually increase its \nroad maintenance funding. The Project will support the maintenance of \nnational roads in the border region. \n \nDeficiencies  in  border  management.  How  well  the  border \nmanagement agencies, such as the Joint Border Committee, perform \nwill determine the extent to which the benefits of road improvement \nreach  across  borders  and  sustain  subregional  cooperation  and \nintegration. A regional TA project is being prepared by ADB to help \nstrengthen the institutional capacity of the governments of Papua New \nGuinea and Timor-Leste in cross-border matters with Indonesia. \n \nInadequate capacity of national contractors. To attract international \ncontractors,  road  rehabilitation  contracts  will  be  designed  in  larger \npackages, and most civil works will be procured through ICB. Joint \nventures  between  international  and  national  contractors  will  be \nencouraged through consultations and pre-bidding workshops. Most of \nthe contract packages for road maintenance are expected to be small, \nand NCB procedures will be used to encourage national contractors to \nparticipate.  Small  contractors  will  be  trained  in  road  maintenance \ntechnology, bidding and contracting, and project management. \n \nLack of legal authority for rights-of-way. Road sector development in \nTimor-Leste is constrained by the lack of a law for securing right-of-\nway. Although no land is expected to be acquired for the Project, a \nresettlement  framework  for  unforeseen  resettlement  and  land \nacquisition has been prepared. \n \nClimate change. There are inherent uncertainties in predicting future \nclimate change, particularly for a \u201cdata-poor\u201d country like Timor-Leste. It \nis therefore assumed that building capacity to manage current climate \nvariability,  with  some  forward-looking  predictions,  will  also  build \ncapacity to understand and manage ongoing and longer-term climate \nchange.  Moreover,  adaptation  options  with  other  important  benefits, \nsuch as erosion control, will be emphasized as a way of reducing the \nrisk of inappropriate investments.  \n \n ", "124o  30'E 126o  30'E\nTIMOR-LESTE\nROAD NETWORK DEVELOPMENT\nRoad Maintenance Program SECTOR PROJECT\nBorder Post\nNational Capital\nDistrict Capital Atauro Island S t r a i t     o f     W e t a r\nTown\nPort\nMaumeta-Atauro\nCandidate Project Road Lauten Com Joco\nJaco\nNational Road Laivai Island\n8 o 30\u2019S District Road Manatuto Baucau Mula Trisulo TutualaCa8pe o  C3u0t\u2019cSha\nRiver Port Hera Metinaro Laga Luro Los Palos\nDILI Vemasse\nDistrict Boundary Liquisa Tibar DILI Laklo Laleia BAUCAU\nLAUTEM\nInternational Boundary Maubara Remexio MANATUTO Venilale Quelicai Baquia Lore\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the Road Network Development Sector Project. \nThe design and monitoring framework for the Project is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Timor-Leste comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of \nAtauro  and  Jaco,  and  Oecussi,  an  exclave  on  the  northwestern  side  of  the island,  within \nIndonesian West Timor. The island of Timor is part of the Malay archipelago and is the largest \nand easternmost of the Lesser Sunda islands. The terrain is dominated by Mount Ramelau, \nwhich bisects the island from east to west. The coastal zones in many parts of the country are \nnarrow, and mostly on steep hillsides.  \n \n3.  The  economy  grew  by  about  10%  in  2008  on  the  strength  of  a  large  increase  in \ngovernment expenditure and growth in agriculture;1 public spending, mainly with revenues from \noffshore petroleum production, continues to climb in 2009.2 Rice production increased by 21% in \n2008 following an expansion in harvested area, although the total production was still about \n60% short of annual requirements. In contrast, about 50% of the population was living below the \npoverty line in 2007, up from about 36% in 2001. According to estimates of the Food and \nAgriculture Organization and the World Food Programme, 38%\u201354% of households in most \ndistricts suffer food shortages 3\u20135 months a year. About 16,000 young people join the workforce \nyearly, but in the rural areas many people are chronically underemployed. Outbreaks of civil \nstrife are a persistent risk, as the heightened tension immediately after the serious wounding of \nthe President in February 2008 showed. \n \n4.  Road is the primary mode of transport, carrying 70% of freight and 90% of passengers. \nLand transport services in Timor-Leste are provided competitively by the private sector, with \nonly minimal interference from the Government, except for licensing and basic vehicle and road \nsafety requirements. Passengers are ferried by minibuses and taxies in the urban areas, and by \nminibuses and light to medium trucks licensed to carry both passengers and freight in the rural \nareas, particularly where roads are poor. A small number of heavy trucks, about 90 in all, \ntransport containers and large equipment, but the narrow roads and difficult terrain severely limit \ntheir road coverage. \n \n5.  Timor-Leste has an extensive road network of about 6,000 kilometers (km), half of which \nare  undeveloped  rural  tracks.  The  core  network  comprises  1,400  km  of  national  roads \nconnecting the capital, Dili, and 13 districts, and 900 km of district roads linking major population \ncenters to the national roads. About 80% (1,800 km) of core roads are (or used to be) paved. \nAlmost the whole core road network needs to be rehabilitated to a maintainable standard, as \nmany roads have prematurely deteriorated. The poor condition of the roads is compounded by \nfrequent landslides and road closures caused by intense rainfall and geotechnical instability in \nmountainous areas.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Asian Development Outlook 2009. Manila. \n2  The Government spent an estimated $450 million in 2008 and expects to spend $902 million in 2009. ", "2 \n6.  Timor-Leste\u2019s expected membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in \n2012 will significantly boost opportunities for cooperation with Indonesia. The two countries \nagreed on 11 June 2003 to regulate border crossings and markets, and the Government of \nTimor-Leste, in April 2008, issued a decree law legalizing border pass activities for its citizens \nand identifying six locations where border posts were to be built.3 National roads in the border \nregion are main corridors to Indonesia, giving Timor-Leste access to cross-border activities. But, \naccording to the 2007 Timor-Leste survey of living standards, the border region and the rest of \nthe western and central districts, which produce much of the country\u2019s main commercial crop, \ncoffee, have a poverty incidence that exceeds their share of the population.4  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Key Challenges \n \n7.  Post-conflict  recovery. The democratic consultation on 30 August 1999 led to an \noverwhelming  vote  for  independence  after  25  years  of  occupation  by  Indonesia.  In  the \ncampaign  of  destruction  that  unfortunately  followed,  however,  about  three-quarters  of  the \npeople  fled  their  homes.  United  Nations  (UN)  Security  Council  Resolution  1272  of \n25 October 1999 placed the country under the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor until \nthe Government announced its independence on 20 May 2002. A UN Mission of Support in East \nTimor replaced the UN transitional administration at that time with plans to withdraw gradually \nfrom the country.5 \n \n8.  The spate of violence in April and May 2006, triggered mainly by tensions between the \npolice, the military, and the youths, drove more than half of Dili\u2019s 150,000 residents from their \nhomes and into overcrowded camps. Damage to property was significant: houses were looted \nand burned. The UN Security Council therefore authorized the creation of a new UN Integrated \nMission in Timor-Leste on 25 August 2006 with the priority task of restoring public security. In \nthe course of recovery, the country was beset from time to time by civil unrest, especially during \nthe presidential and parliamentary election in mid-2007.  \n \n9.  Timor-Leste countered the shock of the attempted assassination of the President and \nthe Prime Minister by military rebels on 11 February 2008 with resilience. Many feared that the \ncountry was reverting to violence, but a stronger government emerged from the incident and its \naftermath. Of the three security challenges identified by the Government, military rebels are no \nlonger a threat, and progress on the other two difficult issues\u2014the settlement of claims of \ndiscrimination raised by a group of former soldiers (\u201cpetitioners\u201d) and the return of internally \ndisplaced persons\u2014has won the Government further credit.6 Since early 2008, political stability \nhas prevailed. \n \n10.  The  UN  Integrated  Mission  in  Timor-Leste  has  worked  with  the  Government  and \ndevelopment partners to tackle the security and stability issues and prevent a relapse into \nconflict. It has adopted a medium-term strategy with four priority areas: (i) security and stability, \nnow and in the future; (ii) the rule of law, justice, and human rights; (iii) a culture of democratic \n                                                 \n3  The six border posts will be at Mota Ain, Tunubibi, Salele, Sakato, Passabe, and Oesilo. \n4  Coffee accounts for over 75% of Timor-Leste exports excluding gas and oil. The inadequacy of road infrastructure \nin the western mountainous areas has adversely affected coffee production and rural development. \n5  The UN Mission of Support in East Timor was succeeded by the UN Office in Timor-Leste (UNOTIL), with a \nmuch-reduced staff, by UN Security Council Resolution 1599 on 28 April 2005 to support the development of \npolice, border patrol, and other critical institutions. \n6  International Crisis Group. 2009.

Brussels. \n ", "3 \ngovernance and dialogue; and (iv) socioeconomic development.7 The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), with its comparative advantage in infrastructure development, has been asked by the \nGovernment to address the constraints on physical infrastructure, particularly in the road sector. \nIn past ADB projects, damaged sections of road were repaired to facilitate humanitarian relief or \nsecurity operations. Now the economy is growing fast, and the road network needs more \ncomprehensive and sustainable improvements to support socioeconomic development.  \n \n11.  Road conditions and maintenance backlog. A road sector analysis is in Appendix 2. \nAccording to a road condition survey in 2009, the national road network has almost entirely \ndeteriorated and is no longer maintainable.8 Journeys are longer, vehicle operating costs higher, \nand rural communities more isolated. Significant income from agriculture and other products is \nlost and social conditions are worsening. The small and isolated market with poor transport links \nis preventing the country from exploiting economies of scale and comparative advantage. About \n$110  million  (in  mid-2009  prices)  is  needed  immediately  to  restore  the  priority  roads  to \nmaintainable condition, without upgrading or realignment. However, the Government and local \nindustry have neither the financing resources nor the capacity for quick rehabilitation. Moreover, \nthe actual investment needs will be significantly higher than $110 million, given the rate of \ndeterioration during the implementation of a sector development program. \n \n12.  Road  infrastructure  must  be  preserved  through  routine  and  periodic  maintenance. \nRoutine maintenance will clear drainage and small landslips promptly, keep vegetation under \ncontrol, and repair surface damage in its early stages. Periodic maintenance to restore road \nsurfaces damaged by traffic abrasion and wet-season erosion could help to postpone the need \nfor  rehabilitation  or  reconstruction.  The  maintenance  works  should  be  programmed \nsystematically to allocate limited resources more efficiently and effectively over the entire road \nnetwork.  The  annual  maintenance  expenditure  for  the  whole  core  road  network  (about \n1,600 km)  in  its  present  condition  is  estimated  at  $25  million.  But  improving  the  roads  to \nmaintainable  condition  will  reduce  the  expenditure  to  about  $10.5 million.  In  2009,  the \nGovernment allocated only about $3.7 million for the maintenance of all national, district, urban, \nand rural roads.  \n \n13.  Road safety. The Timor-Leste National Police reported 1,656 cases of road accidents in \n2008; of these, 50 resulted in fatalities, 215 in serious injuries, and 1,020 in other injuries. Many \nless-serious, unreported cases were not included. The actual number of injuries and fatalities is \nbelieved to be higher. Sixty percent of all reported accidents are attributed to human error, 25% \nto  road  conditions,  10%  to  the  weather,  and  5%  to  mechanical  failure.  The  potential  for \neven-higher accident rates is great, considering the increased number of vehicles, many of \nthem unprotected motorcycles carrying up to four people, and the increased vehicle speeds \nmade possible by economic growth and road improvements. \n \n14.  Government  capacity. The weak capacity of the Government to manage the road \nnetwork also constrains road sector development. The Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood \nControl (DRBFC) of the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI), the central agency responsible for \nplanning, developing, and maintaining road infrastructure, has only 12 engineers\u2014seven at the \nheadquarters  in  Dili  and  five  in  regional  offices.  Each  regional  engineer  is  assisted  by  a \n                                                 \n7  United Nations. 2009.

DRBFC\u2019s main weakness is the shortage of capable \nstaff in the districts to program, administer, and supervise roadworks. \n \n15.  Capacity of national contractors. National contractors are awarded projects of up to \n$1.5 million by the Government but may not always have the technical and financial capacity to \nimplement  these  projects  properly.  The  lack  of  project  management  expertise  and  skills \nexcludes national contractors from large projects. The Government is developing a contractor \nregistration  system,  which  will  classify  contractors  according  to  financial,  technical,  and \nmanagement capacity. The classification will be linked to the size and type of contracts for \nwhich a contractor is eligible to bid. \n \n2.  Opportunities \n \n16.  Government\u2019s strategy. The Government\u2019s vision for the country is contained in the \nNational Development Plan, which sets targets in governance, culture, economy, environment, \neducation,  infrastructure,  and  living  standards  to  be  achieved  by  2020.9 In  regard  to  the \ninfrastructure sectors, according to the plan, \u201cpeople will no longer be isolated, because there \nwill be good roads, transport, electricity, and communications in the towns and villages, in all \nregions  of  the  country.\u201d  Recognizing  the  importance  of  infrastructure  to  all  sectors  of  the \neconomy and society, the Government also calls attention in the plan to the need \u201cto plan for, \nprovide  and  manage  physical  infrastructure  that  is  efficient,  cost-effective,  and  financially \nsustainable, and which supports the social and economic development priorities of the people of \nTimor-Leste.\u201d \n \n17.  The Government is preparing a medium-term strategic plan setting the key priorities for \ndevelopment, with specific goals and objectives.10 The three medium-term strategic objectives \nwill  be  (i) poverty  reduction,  (ii) private  sector  development,  and  (iii) core  infrastructure \ndevelopment. The five core infrastructure sectors will be (i) roads and bridges; (ii) ports and \nairports;  (iii) dams,  irrigation  schemes  and  water  supply;  (iv) electricity;  and \n(v) telecommunications.  Since  2008,  the  Government  has  announced  its  national  priorities \nyearly. Future priorities will be guided by the medium-term strategic plan once it is approved. \n \n18.  While the strategic plan is still in preparation, the Government announced the national \npriorities  for  2010  under  the  plan\u2019s  framework  on  23  May  2009.  The  large  increase  in \ngovernment expenditure and growth in agriculture buoyed up the economy in 2008, but the \nrising  incidence  of  poverty  and  high  unemployment  point  to  the  need  for  better-targeted \ngovernment spending to answer the lack of basic services and the underdevelopment in the \ncountryside. Roads and water supply infrastructure are top priorities for 2010, reflecting the \nmajor  constraint  their  insufficiency  imposes  on  the  country\u2019s  long-term  development  and \nsustainable  economic  growth.  The  Government  has  also  urged  the  line  ministries  and \ndevelopment partners to align their budgets with national priorities. The development of the road \nsector, one of the most important infrastructure sectors, is widely recognized as a key factor in \ncreating  jobs,  promoting  private  sector  growth,  attracting  business  investments,  increasing \nagricultural productivity, and reducing poverty. As the road sector gains high priority in the \ndevelopment agenda of Timor-Leste, the Government plans to significantly increase its budget \nallocation to road sector in the near future. \n                                                 \n9  Planning Commission. 2002.

The medium-term strategic plan was expected to be considered by the Council of \nMinisters in September 2009, and then presented to the National Parliament for approval. \n ", "5 \n \n19.  A road sector investment program was developed in 2005.11 Noting the changes that \nhave occurred since then in traffic volume, road conditions, and financing resources, the project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) consultants surveyed road conditions nationwide and \nundertook  classified  traffic  counts  and  origin\u2013destination  surveys  from  December  2008  to \nMarch 2009. A new medium-term road network development program based on the survey \nresults and findings of stakeholder consultations is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n20.  Sector  development  and  external  assistance.  While  strategic  planning  by  the \nGovernment is making progress, there is a need for better coordination with development \npartners. Working groups with members from government agencies and development partners \ncoordinate  the  implementation  of  the  Government\u2019s  annual  national  priority  programs.  The \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) has set up the Directorate for Aid Effectiveness for more transparent \nand harmonized external aid flows. Budget and aid information is circulated at the quarterly \ndevelopment partners\u2019 meeting, cochaired by the ministers of foreign affairs and finance. MOI \nalso plans to meet regularly with development partners to coordinate external assistance.  \n \n21.  Road sector development in Timor-Leste has relied heavily on external assistance, with \nADB leading the development partners since 1999. A joint assessment mission coordinated by \nthe World Bank was fielded in October\u2013November 1999 to prepare a medium-term restoration \nprogram. Two emergency infrastructure rehabilitation projects were administered by ADB under \nthe restoration program.12 The two projects facilitated peace, security, and humanitarian relief \naid by attending to immediate infrastructure failures in sectors such as roads, ports, and power. \nMeanwhile, an ADB TA grant from 2000 to 2002 supported the first steps in establishing the \ninstitutions and regulatory frameworks for road, port, and airport operation and management.13 \nA second ADB TA project, for Transport Sector Improvement, prepared a medium-term road \ninvestment program in 2005. The priority roads under the program were included in ADB-funded \nRoad Sector Improvement Project (RSIP), which was completed in September 2009.14 \n \n22.  To support the Government\u2019s capital development program and build capacity in the \ninfrastructure sectors, ADB provided TA for Infrastructure Sectors Capacity Development from \n2005 to 2008 at an estimated cost of $600,000,15 and follow-up TA for Infrastructure Project \nManagement at an estimated cost of $15 million cofinanced by the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development.16 \n \n23.  Since 2000, the Government of Japan has provided $34.6 million in grants for transport, \n54% of this total for road improvements and for project studies and training in the road sector. \nThe Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) funded a TA project for capacity building in \nroad maintenance, and another TA project for the preparation of guidelines and manuals for \nroads. The next JICA-funded TA, for capacity building for road works, will be implemented from \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2001.

The European Union has also provided about $50 million \nthrough three rural development programs, each one with a rural road rehabilitation component. \nUnder the second rural development program, five bridges on the road from Viqueque to \nUatucarbau were rehabilitated or reconstructed. A list of external assistance to the road sector \nis in Appendix 3. \n \n24.  Subregional  cooperation  and  integration.  Despite  their  history,  Indonesia  and \nTimor-Leste are moving in a very positive direction. Cooperation with Indonesia, the main \nsource of most of Timor-Leste\u2019s imports, including rice, fuel, construction materials, and other \ncommodities, is expanding. In 2008, Indonesia was the largest source of Timor-Leste\u2019s imports \nand its third-largest export market.17 Membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nin 2012 will increase the opportunities for cooperation between these two countries. At an \nADB-hosted  workshop  for  archipelagic  Southeast  Asia\u2013Pacific  subregional  cooperation \nprograms on 19\u201320 February 2009, senior officials from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and \nTimor-Leste, discussed the needs and action plans for subregional cooperation. A regional TA \nproject is being prepared by ADB to strengthen the institutional capacity of Timor-Leste and \nPapua New Guinea to improve the cross-border economic corridors. \n \n25.  Most households in the border regions of Timor-Leste and Indonesia consider border \ntrade to be their primary source of income. Family reunions and ceremonies also generate \ndemand for border crossing since many Timor-Leste citizens have close relatives in Indonesian \nWest Timor. Among other constraints, the poor cross-border facilities and the poor condition of \nborder roads in Timor-Leste make cross-border trade and activities more difficult. Roads have \nbeen upgraded and border posts constructed on the Indonesia side, but not on the Timor-Leste \nside. To facilitate cross-border commercial or social activities, Timor-Leste must improve its \ncross-border facilities and national roads in the border regions. Improved connectivity in the \nborder  areas  will  create  economic  benefits,  reduce  poverty,  and  promote  the  country\u2019s \nengagement in subregional cooperation and integration. \n \n3.  Lessons \n \n26.  Several lessons can be drawn from past and ongoing road projects in Timor-Leste: \n(i) difficult  terrain,  geology,  and  weather  conditions  require  more  intensive  routine  and \npreventive maintenance of the road network; (ii) the period of road construction is essentially \nreduced  by  4\u20136  months  of  rainy  season  every  year;  (iii) given  the  crowded  community  of \ndevelopment  partners  in  Timor-Leste,  regular  coordination  is  needed  to  avoid  repetitive \ninvestment; (iv) the capacity of national contractors must be developed through actual works of \nappropriate  size  and  well-targeted  training,  and  (v) while  MOI  still  needs  support  in \nimplementing large projects, skills transfer between project management consultants and MOI \nstaff is important in building the capacity of MOI staff. \n \n27.  As the country\u2019s economy grows, more attention should be given to the quality and \nsustainability of road infrastructure. Past ADB projects were aimed at restoring accessibility and \ncentered on repairing only the damaged sections of the road network. While Dili\u2019s connection \nwith most other areas of the country improved, overall road conditions continued to worsen \nbecause the Government could not meet the maintenance needs. The ongoing RSIP is the first \nattempt to move from emergency work to road development. It involves the rehabilitation of \nlonger  stretches  of  road,  labor-intensive  maintenance,  and  community  participation  in  the \n                                                 \n17  Source: National Statistics Office, Ministry of Finance, Timor-Leste. \n ", "7 \ndevelopment  of  rural  roads.  Further  efforts,  such  as  high-quality  road  maintenance  and \nrehabilitation projects and periodic review of the road sector master plan, are needed to improve \nroad infrastructure more effectively. The improvement of the core road network, adequate road \nmaintenance, and community participation in rural road development must be integrated and \nprogressively  expanded  in  the  course  of  road  sector  development.  To  make  road  sector \ninvestments sustainable, stand-alone maintenance contracts should be avoided. A functioning \nroad maintenance program (RMP), including institutional setup, policy framework, programming \nand implementation capacity, and sufficient budget support, is essential. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n28.  The Project will support the Government in rehabilitating priority national and district \nroads under the medium-term road network development program, and in establishing an RMP \nin the border region. It is in line with ADB\u2019s latest country strategy and program (2006\u20132008), \nwhich identified transport infrastructure improvement as a key area of ADB assistance.18 A new \ninterim country strategy for 2009\u20132012 is being prepared and will be aimed at assisting the \nGovernment in reducing poverty by promoting and supporting inclusive growth. The strategy is \nexpected to focus on improving physical infrastructure, particularly rural connectivity to boost \nagricultural productivity growth, generate employment opportunities, and make social service \ndelivery more sustainable. The Project is included in the country operations business plan \n(2008\u20132010) for Timor-Leste.19 \n \n29.  The Project will support Timor-Leste\u2019s national priorities and the National Development \nPlan by developing and managing road infrastructure, and promote subregional cooperation by \nimproving  border  post  facilities.  Furthermore,  the  sector-based  approach  will  allow  the \nGovernment to lead the way in identifying, prioritizing, formulating, appraising, approving, and \nimplementing its sector strategy, and direct resources from development partners. MOI and its \nroad agency, DRBFC, can thus implement the Project in line with the Government\u2019s vision in \nroad sector development, and more actively absorb the knowledge and expertise needed. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n30.  The Project will support road sector development and thereby contribute to economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction in the project areas. It will have an impact on (i) poverty reduction, \n(ii) direct and indirect job creation, and (iii) cross-border trade. \n \n31.  The Project will facilitate access to social and economic facilities in the project areas, \nimprove the efficiency of cross-border activities, reduce travel time and costs, and make the \nroad network less vulnerable to severe climate. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n32.  The Project will finance a portion of medium-term road network development program. \nAt the end of the Project, (i) about 232 km of national or district roads will have been improved \nto maintainable condition; (ii) an RMP will have been established; (iii) access roads and parking \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2005.

The Project was initially listed as \nthe Second Road Sector Improvement Project. \n ", "8 \nareas will have been built to improve cross-border facilities at Mota Ain, Salele, Sakato, and \nOesilo; (iv) national contractors will have gained increased capacity to implement roadworks; \n(v) MOI will have improved its ability to implement road projects and the RMP; (vi) road safety \nawareness in the project areas will have increased; and (vii) climate-proofing measures will \nhave become a regular part of road design and construction. \n \n33.  To achieve the foregoing outputs, the following project activities will be carried out: \n \n(i)  Road rehabilitation. About 232 km of priority national or district roads will be \nrehabilitated to maintainable condition. Each subproject will be selected from the \nnationwide core road network, according to the procedure and eligibility criteria \ngiven in Appendix 4. The medium-term road network development program will \nguide the selection of subprojects. The feasibility study for each subproject will \nprovide justification of its eligibility under the agreed criteria, and will conform in \ndegree of detail and quality with what is required for ADB to assess the viability \nand suitability of the subproject. Two sample roads (Liquica\u2013Batugade\u2013Mota Ain \nand Ermera\u2013Maliana, about 140 km in total) have been selected for appraisal, \nand will serve as models for the technical, economic, social, and environmental \nassessments of non-sample roads. The feasibility studies of the two sample \nsubprojects are in Supplementary Appendixes B\u2013G. \n(ii)  Road maintenance program. About 302 km of national roads in the border \nregion 20 will  be  maintained  yearly  during  project  implementation.  Contract \npackages appropriate for small national contractors are designed to develop the \nlocal contracting industry. Small contractors will be trained in road maintenance \ntechnology, bidding and contracting, and project management. A summary of the \napproach for establishing the road maintenance program is in Appendix 5. \n(iii)  Construction of border post facilities. Roads and parking lots will be built at \nthe border posts in Mota Ain, Salele, Sakato, and Oesilo. The Government will \nfinance and administer the design of border post facilities, and procure civil works \nfor roads and parking lots according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n(iv)  Consulting  services.  Consultants  will  be  hired  for  project  management, \nfeasibility study, detailed design, the RMP (including the training of small national \ncontractors), construction supervision, and monitoring and evaluation.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Engaging Weakly Performing Countries \n \n34.  Timor-Leste is a fragile, post-conflict country. The small and isolated market with poor \ntransport links has prevented the country from exploiting economies of scale and comparative \nadvantage. Management and implementation capacity is very weak. MOI, which is responsible \nfor all infrastructure activities, cannot function fully because of seriously limited institutional \ncapacity. The project design draws on ADB\u2019s approach to engaging with weakly performing \ncountries.21 The approach entails (i) promoting selective and sustained engagement in areas \nwhere ADB has comparative advantage (the road sector in Timor-Leste); (ii) supplementing \ninvestment financing with community-based approaches (to be implemented under a linked \nproject proposed for Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction [JFPR] financing); and (iii) developing \n                                                 \n20 In the districts of Bobonaro, Covalima, and Oecussi. \n21 ADB. 2007. Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries. Manila. \n ", "9 \ncapacity to promote ownership of development processes (reflected mainly in the design of the \ntraining  program  for  national  contractors  and  the  RMP  to  be  established  by  the  project \nmanagement unit [PMU] and handed over to MOI midway through project implementation). \n \n2.  Building  the  Capacity  of  the  Directorate  of  Roads,  Bridges,  and  Flood \nControl  \n \n35.  The Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control of MOI oversees the road sector. \nHowever, its operation is heavily constrained by its current staff capacity of only 12 engineers\u2014\nseven at headquarters and one in each of the five regional offices. The Project will provide \non-the-job training to counterpart DRBFC staff to complement the ADB TA for Infrastructure \nProject Management, which was designed to strengthen MOI\u2019s project management capacity \nand facilitate budget execution (footnote 16). The PMU will also involve DRBFC in the selection, \nappraisal, detailed engineering, and construction supervision of road rehabilitation subprojects \nto facilitate the transfer of skills to DRBFC. \n \n3.  Building the Capacity of Small Contractors  \n \n36.  According  to  DRBFC,  there  are  about  180  small  contractors  in  Timor-Leste  with \nexperience in implementing road maintenance and rehabilitation works. The Project will promote \nthe growth of a contracting industry for small-scale civil works, which is now underinvested \nbecause of a lack of business opportunities, along with opportunities for training and skills \ndevelopment. Most national contractors do not have enough knowledge and skills to do road \nconstruction work, prepare bids, or manage a business. The Project will hire consultants to train \nsmall  contractors.  Participation  in  the  training  will  be  a  prerequisite  for  bidding  for  road \nmaintenance contracts.  \n \n4.  Creating Jobs \n \n37.  The  Project  will  create  jobs.  The  civil  works,  including  road  rehabilitation  and \nmaintenance and bioengineering, will generate about 22,000 person-months of employment. \nThere  will  be  long-term  business  opportunities  for  contractors,  and  thus  sustainable \nemployment,  under  the  RMP.  In  the  three  pilot  districts,  the  RMP  will  provide  about \n8,580 person-months  of  employment  in  4  years.  After  the  Government  expands  it  to  all \n13 districts, the job opportunities will increase significantly.  \n \n5.  Facilitating Subregional Cooperation and Integration \n \n38.  The rehabilitation and maintenance of national roads in the border region, and the \nconstruction of four border posts on the national road network, will further the progress of \ncooperation with Indonesia. The maintenance works on roads linking three districts in the border \nareas will also give the rest of the country better access to cross-border activities.  \n \n6.  Establishing a Road Maintenance Program  \n \n39.  Delayed and inadequate maintenance is a major cause of premature road deterioration \nin  Timor-Leste.  Proper  maintenance  is  generally  regarded  as  the  most  effective  way  of \npreserving the value of road assets. The Project will help the DRBFC to establish an RMP, \ninitially in the border region. MOI is expected to replicate the model in other regions. To set up \nthe RMP, the Project will coordinate with the team of JICA-funded consultants that will be \nengaged in operating the road maintenance management database and equipment. \n ", "10 \n7.  Improving Road Safety \n \n40.  Poor road safety is the increasing cause of injuries and loss of life and property. As the \neconomy grows, road travel for social and economic activities will also grow. Most trips are now \nmade on unprotected motorcycles carrying up to four passengers. Better roads will make higher \nvehicle speeds possible and thus heighten the risk of road accidents. Road safety awareness \nprograms will be conducted for road users and roadside communities. Traffic safety measures \nwill also be incorporated into the Project, from engineering design to civil works implementation.  \n \n8.  Adapting to Climate Change \n \n41.  Being  a  highly  mountainous,  small-island  country  makes  Timor-Leste  especially \nvulnerable to the impact of climate change. The impact can be far reaching because of the \ncountry\u2019s low level of development and dependence on climate-dependent economic sectors, \nand its low capacity to adapt. Some projected changes can intensify drought in some regions \nand floods in others, reduce agricultural productivity, and damage coastal roads as the sea level \nrises. Much of Timor-Leste\u2019s transportation infrastructure is in highly sensitive areas, where \nlandslides,  land  degradation  and  sedimentation,  and  even  the  complete  disappearance  of \ncoastal roads are constant risks. The Project will build climate-proofing measures into road \nrehabilitation and maintenance by considering future climate data when reviewing engineering \ndesigns and plans and by making adaptation measures part of the environmental management \nplan (EMP). The models to be developed through the Project can influence the Government\u2019s \nroad sector strategy and thus have an impact beyond the Project. \n \n9.  Encouraging Community Participation in Roadworks \n \n42.  Besides  the  Project,  a  linked  project\u2014Our  Roads,  Our  Future:  Supporting  Local \nGovernance and Community-Based Infrastructure Works\u2014will be proposed for financing from \nthe  JFPR.  The  linked  project  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  decentralization  strategy  and \ncommunity-based  infrastructure  works  in  Timor-Leste.  It  will  (i) extend  the  socioeconomic \nbenefits of the national road improvements under the Project to roadside communities, and \n(ii) develop a model for sustainable community participation in community infrastructure work \nwith local government. The linked JFPR project will be implemented in the districts of Bobonaro, \nCovalima, and Oecussi, which overlap with the areas covered by the RMP under the Project. A \nsummary of the linked JFPR project is in Appendix 6. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n43.  The  project  investment  cost,  including  taxes,  duties,  and  physical  and  price \ncontingencies, is estimated at $52.90 million.

Financing Plan \n \n44.  The Government has requested a grant of $46 million from ADB to help finance the \nProject. The Asian Development Fund grant will finance all foreign exchange cost, local cost for \nconsulting services, equipment, project management, 95% of cost of civil works for access \nroads and parking areas of border posts, 90% of the cost of civil works for the rehabilitation of \nabout  232  km  of  national  roads,  70%  of  the  cost  of  civil  works  for  road  maintenance. \nCounterpart funds of $6.9 million from the Government will cover 5% of the cost of civil works \nfor access roads and parking areas of border posts, 10% of the cost of civil works for road \nrehabilitation, 30% of the cost of civil works for road maintenance, and any taxes and duties, \nland acquisition and resettlement costs, and right-of-way costs.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n45.  MOI will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall project management. It will \noperate  through  its  PMU,  which  was  established  under  the  Emergency  Infrastructure \nRehabilitation Project 2 and inherited by RSIP. Assessments of procurement capacity and \nfinancial management recommend this PMU arrangement, considering the weak capacity of \n ", "12 \nMOI  (Supplementary  Appendixes  H\u2013I).  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  (i) overall  project \nimplementation; (ii) stakeholder consultation and coordination; (iii) the procurement of goods, \nworks,  and  consulting  services  for  road  rehabilitation  and  maintenance; 22  (iv) contract \nadministration; (v) sector development support to MOI; and (vi) on-the-job training of counterpart \nMOI staff. (Outline terms of reference for the PMU are in Supplementary Appendix J.) Individual \nconsultants will be hired for the project management staff through competitive recruitment.23 \n \n46.  MOI will assign counterpart staff from DRBFC to the PMU to participate in project \nimplementation, particularly the development and implementation of the RMP. The PMU will \nprovide these counterpart staff with on-the-job training to enable DRBFC eventually to take over \nthe RMP and to build DRBFC capacity for regular road project management. At the end of the \nProject, the PMU will be integrated into MOI\u2019s permanent institutional setup, and the national \nstaff of the PMU will be absorbed by MOI. \n \n47.  ADB  will  finance  the  staff,  equipment,  and  operating  expenses  of  the  PMU  for \nimplementing the Project and supporting sector development. ADB financing is justified because \n(i) the capacity of MOI for project implementation and sector development is limited and needs \nto be strengthened, (ii) the PMU\u2019s performance in previous projects has been satisfactory to \nboth the Government and ADB, (iii) the PMU\u2019s knowledge of and working experience with \nADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines  will  speed  up  project  implementation,  and  (iv) the  PMU\u2019s \neffectiveness in capacity development has been proven by the promotion of the previous project \nmanager to the position of minister of MOI, and the material engineer to secretary of state for \npublic works. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n48.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  5  years,  with  physical  completion  by \nNovember 2014. To give MOI enough time to withdraw funds from the grant account, the \nProject has been set to close on 31 May 2015, 6 months after physical completion. The \npre-rehabilitation activities\u2014detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, tendering, and \nawarding of contracts\u2014will start in January 2010. Civil works for sample roads are expected to \nstart in September 2010. For non-sample roads, the MOI will start subproject appraisals in \nJanuary 2011. An implementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n49.  All procurement under the Project will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, \nas amended from time to time). All contracts over $1 million for civil works and $0.5 million for \ngoods will undergo international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts below those amounts will \ngo through national competitive bidding (NCB) or, as appropriate for works contracts up to \n$100,000,  through  shopping  (A  procurement  plan,  including  suitable  contract  packaging  to \nattract international contractors and promote the national contracting industry, is in Appendix 9.) \nThe procurement of all contract packages for road rehabilitation, the first five contract packages \nfor road maintenance, and all contract packages for border post construction will require prior \nreview by ADB. Other road maintenance packages will be reviewed after procurement. \n                                                 \n22  The construction of border post facilities is in the Government's project pipeline for 2009 and 2010. Only the \nconstruction of access roads and parking areas will be funded by the Project. The procurement unit of the MOF will \nprocure the civil works, and the PMU will administer the construction of the access roads and parking areas. \n23  In view of the difficulty of hiring well-qualified national consultants in Timor-Leste, the financial administrator \n(national) and road maintenance engineer (national) of PMU, who were competitively recruited in 2003 under the \nEmergency Infrastructure Rehabilitation Project 2, will be retained in PMU through contract extensions. \n ", "13 \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n50.  A consulting firm will be hired as project implementation support consultant (PISC) under \nthe  Project  to  provide  497  person-months  of  consulting  services  (141  international  and \n356  national). The PISC will support the PMU in (i) subproject appraisal, (ii) detailed design, \n(iii) RMP  preparation  and  implementation  including  the  training  of  national  contractors, \n(iv) construction supervision, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. (Outline terms of reference for \nthe PISC are in Supplementary Appendix K.) The recruitment will be made through quality- and \ncost-based selection following ADB\u2019s prior review, in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Financial audit consultants will be hired \nthrough least-cost selection. \n \n5.  Anticorruption and Governance Measures  \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  MOI.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \ngrant regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n52.  An information disclosure system will be established by (i) displaying, on notice boards \noutside government offices and important public places in roadside communities, information \nregarding contracts, the list of participating bidders, the name of the winning bidder, basic \ndetails on bidding procedures, the contract award, and the list of goods and services procured; \n(ii) notifying the communities of the date and location of selected events in the procurement \nprocess  (e.g.,  public  bid  openings,  progress  reviews,  and  handover  ceremonies);  and \n(iii) establishing a grievance redress mechanism at the PMU to receive and resolve complaints \nand grievances from communities, contractors, etc. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n53.  The  grant  proceeds  for  the  Project  will  be  disbursed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  facilitate  project \nimplementation and funds flow, the imprest account will be set up in a bank acceptable to ADB. \nThe imprest account will be managed by PMU under the supervision of MOI and MOF, and will \nbe  used  exclusively  to  finance  ADB\u2019s  share  of  eligible  expenditures.  MOF,  through  its \nauthorization,  will  ensure  that  withdrawals  from  the  imprest  account  are  managed  by  two \nsignatories,  one  from  MOI/PMU  and  another  from  the  treasury  department  of  MOF.  The \nproposed signatories for the withdrawal application and the operation of the imprest account \nmust have ADB\u2019s prior approval. The initial advance to be deposited in the imprest account will \nbe based on 6 months\u2019 estimated expenditures to be financed from the imprest account or \n$500,000, whichever is less. If needed, the imprest account ceiling may be adjusted during \nimplementation, subject to compliance with the requirements in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. The amount in the imprest account may not at any time exceed 10% of the total \nADB grant. Direct payment and reimbursement procedures will be used for eligible project \nexpenditures  under  large  contracts.  Such  an  arrangement  is  supported  by  a  financial \n ", "14 \nmanagement  assessment  of  the  MOI\u2019s  and  the  PMU\u2019s  performance  in  previous  projects \n(Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n54.  The Government has asked ADB to approve advance action for the recruitment of \nconsultants  and  the  procurement  of  civil  works.  Advance  contracting  actions  cover \nprequalification,  invitation  of  bids,  bidding,  bid  evaluation,  and  limited  contract  award.  The \nadvance actions must conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. The Government has been advised that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n55.  To meet the implementation schedule, the pre-construction activities will start in 2009. \nThe  Project  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for  project  management  related  consulting \nservices, and civil works. 24 Retroactive financing will be permitted only if (i) ADB and the \nBorrower specifically agree to it in the grant agreement, and only pursuant to the terms of the \nrelevant agreement; (ii) the goods, works, services, and consultants for which it is requested are \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants; and (iii) the amount to be retroactively financed does not exceed 10% of the grant \n(a higher amount may be allowed only with ADB\u2019s approval). The expenditure must also have \nbeen incurred before the effectiveness of the grant, but no earlier than 12 months before the \nsigning date of the grant agreement. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n56.  MOI, with assistance from the PMU, will maintain separate project records and accounts \nadequate  to  identify  (i) the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  grant  proceeds,  (ii) the \nfinancing  resources  received  from  each  financier,  (ii)  all  expenditures  incurred  on  the \ncomponents of the Project and their financing resources, and (iv) the counterpart funds received \nand expended. MOI will hire independent external auditors acceptable to ADB for a yearly audit \nof the project accounts, including project expenditures and transactions, imprest accounts, and \ncounterpart  funds.  MOI  will  submit  to  ADB  certified  copies  of  the  audited  annual  project \naccounts, as well as the auditor\u2019s report, within 6 months of the end of each financial year \nduring  the  implementation  period.  The  audit  opinion  will  cover  (i) an  assessment  of  the \nadequacy of accounting and internal control systems for project expenditures and transactions \nto ensure safe custody of assets financed by the Project; (ii) a determination as to whether the \nGovernment  and  MOI  have  adequately  documented  all  financial  transactions,  specifically \nimprest account procedures; and (iii) confirmation of compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements for \nproject management. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest account procedure \nwill also be part of the audit report. ADB\u2019s policy on the submission of audited accounts, which \ncovers failure to submit audited accounts and financial statements by the due dates, has been \nexplained to the Government. If there is more than 6 months\u2019 delay in the submission of an \naudited financial statement, ADB may not approve new contract awards. If the delay is more \nthan 12 months, grant disbursements may be suspended or the grant may be canceled outright. \n \n57.  MOI, through the PMU, will prepare and submit to ADB quarterly progress reports giving \n(i) a narrative description of progress made during the reporting period, (ii) changes in the \nimplementation schedule, (iii) projected expenditures in the next 6 months, (iv) problems or \ndifficulties encountered, (v) an account of the implementation of the resettlement plan (if any), \nand (vi) activities to be undertaken in the next reporting period. MOI will prepare and submit to \n                                                 \n24 ADB\u2019s management review meeting (MRM) for the Project approved advance actions on 23 July 2009. \n ", "15 \nADB a subproject completion report within 3 months of the completion of each subproject, and a \nproject completion report within 6 months after project completion. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n58.  ADB and the Government will agree on a set of indicators for project performance in \nrelation to its impact and outcomes, consistent with the design and monitoring framework in \nAppendix 1, and with emphasis on poverty reduction. Consultants will be hired by MOI to \nmonitor and evaluate the key indicators for road transport characteristics, income patterns, \naccess to social services, and environmental issues. A baseline survey will establish a database \nof existing conditions, and there will be yearly follow-up rounds of data collection. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n59.  ADB will review the Project every 6 months. Each review will cover all institutional, \nadministrative, organizational, technical, environmental, social, poverty reduction, resettlement, \neconomic, financial, and other relevant aspects that may affect the performance of the Project \nand its continuing viability. The Government and ADB will jointly undertake a midterm review of \nthe Project within about 2 years of its start. The midterm review will focus on (i) project impact, \n(ii) implementation progress, (iii) the performance of consultants and contractors, (v) the status \nof compliance with covenants in the grant agreement, and (vi) the need for any midcourse \nchanges in project scope or schedule to ensure full achievement of the intended impact. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n \n60.  Preliminary  economic  analyses  have  been  prepared  for  63  national  or  district  links \n(about 1,675 km) in the core road network. The economic analysis used the roads economic \ndecision  model  developed  by  the  World  Bank,  with  input  derived  from  the  analysis  and \nassessment of transport and traffic surveys, and road condition surveys, both done in early \n2009. Cost and benefit streams with and without the Project over a 20-year period, discounted \nat an interest rate of 12%, were analyzed. Thirty-two priority road links (about 972 km) were \nrecommended for immediate investment. \n \n61.  Two road links were selected as sample subprojects for rehabilitation. The work will be \nundertaken  within  the  existing  road  alignments.  Detailed  economic  analyses  have  been \nprepared for the two road links (Liquica\u2013Batugade\u2013Mota Ain and Ermera\u2013Maliana) as part of \nthe sample feasibility study under the project preparatory TA. The two sample subprojects have \neconomic internal rates of return of 25% and 26%. \n \nB.  Poverty Reduction and Social Impact \n \n62.  In Timor-Leste, about three-quarters of the poor live in the rural areas and one-quarter in \nthe urban areas.25 At the national level, 64% of the poor, and 76% of the non-poor, have access \nto all-weather roads. According to the TLSLS 2007 results, 80% of the total poor population and \n90% of the rural poor depend on agriculture. Improving access to markets can contribute to \npoverty reduction by increasing farming inputs. According to the June 2007 crop and food \nsupply assessment mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food \n                                                 \n25 Ministry of Finance and the World Bank. 2008. Timor-Leste: Poverty in a Young Nation. Dili. \n ", "16 \nProgramme to Timor-Leste, 38%\u201354% of households suffer food shortages 3\u20135 months per \nyear in most districts. The road improvements will lead to increased marketing, and increased \nhousehold incomes. With improved access to local and regional markets and towns, farmers will \nbe able to expand and diversify their agricultural production. People can get better prices for \ntheir products when they sell at larger markets or directly to factories rather than through \nmiddlemen. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 10. \n \n63.  Better access to health facilities will improve the health of the people, in particular \nwomen  and  children.  The  people  of  Timor-Leste  are  vulnerable  to  respiratory  diseases, \ndiarrheal malaria, dengue fever, tuberculosis, leprosy, and other treatable diseases. Improved \naccess to health-care facilities will encourage people to seek medical assistance. Better roads \nwill also ease travel to schools, and help strengthen the school system by reducing teacher \nabsentee rates and enabling school to attract more qualified teachers.  \n \n64.  In Timor-Leste, sociocultural factors contribute to low enrollment and high dropout rates \namong female students, high illiteracy among adult females, high female unemployment, sex \nsegregation in the paid labor force, an emerging gender gap in wages, high maternal mortality, \nand domestic violence. About 28% of women suffer from malnutrition; of these, 7% are in need \nof treatment. The gender-specific benefits of the Project are (i) improved access to health-care \nfacilities;  (ii) improved  access  to  schools,  social  services,  and  other  key  facilities;  and \n(iii) targeted employment opportunities for female laborers, such as bioengineering. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact \n \n65.  The Project is a category B project, according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003),  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nregulations.26 Accordingly, an initial environmental examination (IEE) has been prepared for it. \nSelection criteria  have been  set  to  ensure  that  future  subprojects comply  with  the  project \nenvironmental  classification.  An  environmental  assessment  review  procedure  has  been \nprepared in Supplementary Appendix L; it presents the general environmental impact of the \nproject activities, the selection criteria, and environmental procedures for future subprojects. It \nwill guide the environmental assessment of the subprojects likely to be financed under the \nProject, and the approval of those assessments. The summary IEE is in Appendix 11.  \n \n66.  The  habitats  in  both  subproject  areas  have  been  affected  by  human  interference \n(anthropogenic influence) and have no legal conservation status. Proper mitigation measures \nhave been proposed in the EMP to ensure that environmental impact is minimized to acceptable \nlevels. The EMP will be incorporated into the design of the road subprojects. The EMP will guide \nMOI and the contractors in managing environmental impact mitigation and compliance. The IEE \nand the EMP for each subproject must be approved by ADB and the National Directorate of \nEnvironmental  Services  before  bidding  documents  for  civil  works  can  be  issued.  The \nenvironmental management capacity of the DRBFC will be strengthened through on-the-job \ntraining in EMP implementation and compliance monitoring. The training may extend to the \nrelevant officers of the Directorate of Environmental Services as requested.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n26 United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor. 2003. Guideline 1: Environmental Requirements for the \nDevelopment Proposals. Dili. \n ", "17 \nD.  Climate Change Adaptation \n \n67.  Understanding how climate change may affect the road sector will allow appropriate \nmeasures  to  be  taken  to  avoid  losses  due  to  climate  change  and  to  take  advantage  of \nopportunities that arise. Taking into consideration the impact of climate change and formulating \nadaptation  measures  to  be  incorporated  into  the  project  design  will  minimize  the  adverse \nimpact, hence, ensure that the Project achieves its poverty reduction goals. Peak rainfall, the \nmost important climate parameter in road engineering, will be the focus of the climate analysis. \nA \u201cno-regret\u201d approach to climate-proofing will be taken to minimize the country\u2019s vulnerability to \nthe  adverse  effects  of  climate  change  and  minimize  risks  of  road  sector  investment.  The \ntechnical approach of climate proofing is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \nE.  Social Safeguards \n \n1.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n68.  The Project is a category B project with respect to involuntary resettlement. The civil \nworks  under  the  Project  will  be conducted  within  existing  road  alignments;  therefore,  only \nminimal  temporary  impact  on  land  or  resettlement  impact  is  expected.27 The  number  of \nhouseholds that may experience incidental impact from civil works will be small. The two sample \nroads have been screened and their impact on involuntary resettlement has been determined to \nbe minor or insignificant. The impact will be assessed through the screening of each subproject.  \nA resettlement framework (Supplementary Appendix N) has been prepared for the Project as a \nprecaution. The resettlement framework is based on ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) and relevant sections of the Operations Manual28 and Gender Checklist: Resettlement \n(2003),29 as well as the process that has been adopted when land or assets have to be acquired \nfor civil works in Timor-Leste. The resettlement framework will guide MOI and PMU in preparing \nand implementing resettlement plans for subprojects requiring resettlement. A summary of the \nresettlement framework is in Appendix 12. \n \n2.  Indigenous People \n \n69.  In Timor-Leste, ethnic association is bound up with language. Seventeen languages, \nderived  from  one  of  two  broad  language  groups\u2014Austronesian  (Malayo-Polynesian)  and \nPapuan (Melanesian)\u2014are spoken across the country. The social assessment concluded that \nno significant differences in cultural and social identity exist among the people who speak \ndifferent languages, and that no ethnic minority groups are expected to be adversely affected by \nthe Project. Therefore, the Project is a category B project with respect to the ADB Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). If necessary, actions will be taken through resettlement frameworks \nand resettlement plans. \n \nF.  Assumptions and Risks \n \n70.  The Project makes several assumptions and is subject to various risks, as follows: \n \n                                                 \n27 Resettlement, as defined in ADB policy, involves permanent or temporary impact caused by (i) the acquisition of \nland or other fixed assets; (ii) a change in the use of land; or (iii) restrictions imposed on land, regardless of \nwhether it involves actual relocation. \n28  ADB. 2006. Involuntary Resettlement. Operations Manual. OM F2/BP. Manila. \n29  ADB. 2003. Gender Checklist: Resettlement. Manila. \n ", "18 \n(i)  Resurgence of conflict. High unemployment and high poverty incidence are \nheightening the potential for instability. The Government is pursuing a significant \nreform  agenda  and  has  made  progress  in  addressing  the  causes  and \nconsequences of the 2006 unrest. Displaced people have returned, and the \nGovernment has introduced reforms in the security sector, addressed claims of \ndiscrimination raised by former soldiers, and made social transfer payments to \nvulnerable groups. The police force is gradually resuming responsibility for law \nand order, while UN police and international forces continue to bolster security. \n(ii)  Limited  capacity  of  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure.  MOI  has  both  human \nresource and budget constraints. The budget allocation for the road sector in \n2009 is only about $11 million, making the 6,000 km road network severely \nunderinvested. As the road agency, DRBFC has only 12 engineers. The PMU \nunder  MOI  will  therefore  be  maintained  and  strengthened  to  oversee  and \nadminister  day-to-day  matters.  ADB  is  also  implementing  TA  to  strengthen \nproject management capacity and improve budget execution. \n(iii)  Lack  of  road  maintenance  financing.  DRBFC  used  to  rely  on  a  road \nmaintenance management system developed under a JICA TA project for road \nmaintenance  planning,  but  there  has  always  been  a  shortage  of  human \nresources and funds for planned road maintenance. The Government has given \nits assurance that it will gradually increase its road maintenance funding. The \nProject will support the maintenance of national roads in the border region. \n(iv)  Deficiencies  in  border  management.  How  well  the  border  management \nagencies, such as the Joint Border Committee, perform will determine the extent \nto which the benefits of road improvement reach across borders and sustain \nsubregional cooperation and integration. A regional TA project is being prepared \nby ADB to help strengthen the institutional capacity of the governments of Papua \nNew Guinea and Timor-Leste in cross-border matters with Indonesia. \n(v)  Inadequate  capacity  of  national  contractors.  To  attract  international \ncontractors, road rehabilitation contracts will be designed in larger packages, and \nmost  civil  works  will  be  procured  through  ICB.  Joint  ventures  between \ninternational and national contractors will be encouraged through consultations \nand pre-bidding workshops. Most of the contract packages for road maintenance \nare  expected  to  be  small,  and  NCB  procedures  will  be  used  to  encourage \nnational  contractors  to  participate.  Small  contractors  will  be  trained  in  road \nmaintenance technology, bidding and contracting, and project management. \n(vi)  Lack of legal authority for rights-of-way. Road sector development in Timor-\nLeste is constrained by the lack of a law for securing right-of-way. Although no \nland is expected to be acquired for the Project, a resettlement framework for \nunforeseen resettlement and land acquisition has been prepared. \n(vii)  Climate change. There are inherent uncertainties in predicting future climate \nchange, particularly for a \u201cdata-poor\u201d country like Timor-Leste. It is therefore \nassumed that building capacity to manage current climate variability, with some \nforward-looking predictions, will also build capacity to understand and manage \nongoing  and  longer-term  climate  change.  Moreover,  adaptation  options  with \nother important benefits, such as erosion control, will be emphasized as a way of \nreducing the risk of inappropriate investments. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n71.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  and  MOI  have  given  the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n ", "19 \n \n(i)  Subproject selection. Subprojects will be selected from the medium-term road \nnetwork development program. Prior to the detailed design of any subproject, the \nGovernment will obtain ADB\u2019s concurrence on the inclusion of the subproject for \nfinancing under the Project, based on the agreed appraisal and eligibility criteria. \n(ii)  Project management unit. Within 3 months of the grant effectiveness date, the \nGovernment, through MOI, and assisted by ADB in consultant selection, will \nrecruit  required  consultants  to  ensure  the  PMU  capacity  for  sector  project \nimplementation. At the completion of the Project, the national staff of PMU will be \noffered to join MOI as a regular staff. \n(iii)  Road safety.

Sector Situation \n \n1.   Sector Profile \n \n1.  Timor-Leste is a small and mountainous island country, with a population of about \n1 million and a land area of 14,609 square kilometers (km2). It is located at the eastern end of \nthe Sunda archipelago and has a dramatic topography dominated by Mount Ramelau, which \nbisects the island from east to west. About 44% of the land area has an elevation of 100\u2013\n500 meters  (m),  and  35%  above  1,000 m,  making  road  building  expensive  and  road \nmaintenance difficult.1   \n \n2.  In Timor-Leste, roads play a vital role in economic development and country integration. \nAs the primary mode of transport, roads carry about 70% of freight and 90% of passengers. \nTimor-Leste  has  an  extensive  road  network  of  about  6,000  km;  half  of  the  roads  are \nundeveloped rural tracks. According to the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI), the core network \ncomprises 1,426 km of national roads and 869 km of district roads. The national road network, \nlinking the 13 districts, comprises two (northern and southern) coastal roads and five roads \ntraversing north\u2013south connecting the two coastal roads. The district roads link major population \ncenters to the national roads. The core network is supplemented by 716 km of urban roads in \nDili and several smaller towns and cities, and more than 3,000 km of rural roads providing \naccess to villages and more remote areas with agricultural potential. \n \n3.  The  road  network  was  constructed  under  relatively  low  standards  of  design  and \nmaterials adapting to the often-severe terrain conditions. Although about 80% (1,800 km) of \ncore roads used to be sealed, the roads were constructed with two standard narrow pavement \nwidths\u20143.2 m and 4.5 m. Even such road widths have often been compromised by actual \nterrain  conditions,  resulting  in  many  very  narrow  roads.  In  mountainous  regions,  the  poor \nhorizontal or vertical alignments of roads limit the traveler\u2019s sight distance, and pose additional \ndanger to traffic. The rural roads that provide access to villages and communities and connect \nto the core network are mostly undeveloped tracks. \n \n2.  Road Condition \n \n4.  Almost the whole core road network needs rehabilitation to restore the network to a \nmaintainable condition. The roads have prematurely deteriorated because of lack of routine and \npreventive  maintenance.  The  deterioration  has  been  compounded  by  intense  rainfall  and \ngeotechnical instability in mountainous areas causing frequent landslides. According to a road \ncondition  survey  of  the  core  network  in  early  2009,  almost  the  entire  road  network  has \ndeteriorated and is no longer maintainable.2 As shown in Table A2.1, only about 8% of the core \nroads are in fair condition, about 22% in poor condition, and about 70% in very poor condition.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  World Bank. 2004.

Transport demand and vehicle ownership in Timor-Leste are modest. However, both \nhave  been  growing  substantially  over  the  last  5  years,  particularly  where  motorcycles  are \nconcerned. Average annual growth of motorized vehicles in 2004\u20132008 was 8.5% excluding \nmotorcycles,  and  16.2%  including  motorcycles.  The  traffic  volume  is  concentrated  on  the \nnorthern east\u2013west axis, linking Dili and other district centers along the coast. Other than a few \nkey north\u2013south links, the traffic volume in the southern regions is low. Traffic counts conducted \non the core network in early 2009 indicated that the average daily traffic for motorized vehicles \non national roads is about 215 excluding motorcycles (about 476 including motorcycles), and on \nnational roads about 42 excluding motorcycles (103 including motorcycles). The heaviest traffic \nflows, in excess of 1,000 vehicles per day excluding motorcycles, are on the northern coastal \nroad. \n \n6.  The nationwide classified traffic counts in 2005 and 2009 indicated that traffic volumes \nincreased significantly over the 4-year period. Motorcycles are now the dominant road vehicles, \nand their use and predominance over other vehicle types continues to grow. Private cars, jeeps, \nfour-wheel drives, pickups, and minibuses are other important groups of road users with rapid \nannual growth rates of more than 15%. The use of large buses has been declining because the \nnarrow, winding mountainous roads are hardly passable. Table A2.2 compares the vehicle fleet \nin 2005 and 2009.  \n \nTable A2.2: Vehicle Fleet \n \nEstimated Total  Estimated Total \nVehicle Type  Number in 2005  Number in 2009 \nMotorcycles  11,012  32,305 \nPrivate cars, taxis, jeeps, and 4WD  5,414  15,539 \nPickups, vans, and minibuses  3,303  3,123 \nMedium and large buses  200  155 \nLight and medium trucks  2,167  2,127 \nHeavy and specialized trucks  61  89 \nTotal  22,157  44,323 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n7.  Weather and coffee production are two major factors affecting traffic. The rainy season \nhas a direct impact on traffic patterns. The duration of the rainy season can vary in different \nareas of the country, between an average of 4 months (from December to March) and 8 months \n(from November to June). Landslides and flooding, which are common during that season, \ncause frequent road closures. Another factor affecting traffic patterns over the year is the coffee \nproduction and harvesting cycle. Five coffee-growing centers are concentrated in the western \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \narea of Timor-Leste. The coffee is picked up by small trucks and first brought to wet factories for \nprocessing, then sent to other factories for drying, and finally to Dili for final processing and \nshipping.  The  coffee  harvest  season  peaks  between  August  and  September.  During  that \nseason, light and medium truck traffic in the coffee-growing areas and between those areas and \nDili increase significantly. \n \n4.  Transport Services \n \n8.  Transport services in Timor-Leste, both for passengers and for goods, are provided \ncompetitively by the private sector. There is only minimal interference from the Government, \nexcept  for  licensing  and  basic  vehicle  and  road  safety  requirements.  In  the  urban  areas, \npassenger services are largely provided by minibuses (and to a much lesser extent, in Dili, also \nby  taxicabs).  In  the  rural  areas,  particularly  where  road  conditions are  difficult,  passenger \nservices are also provided by minibuses, and by light and medium trucks where passengers \nstand or sit on the flatbed. The multipurpose light and medium trucks are licensed to carry both \npassengers and freight. Finally, a small number of heavy trucks, about 90 in total, mainly \ntransport containers and large equipment, but are limited in area coverage by the narrow road \nwidths and difficult terrain. \n \n9.  Currently, land transport services between the Timor-Leste mainland and the Oecussi \nexclave are complicated. All people crossing the border through Indonesian West Timor are \nrequired to have passports with valid Indonesian visas, which can be obtained only in Dili. Thus, \nthe number of people and vehicles crossing is still low at present although it is increasing. A \nferry  operates  between  Dili  and  Oecussi  twice  a  week,  as  an  alternative  to  the  difficult \nland crossing. It has a capacity of about 300 passengers and 170 tons of freight. \n \n5.  Regulations and Specifications \n \n10.  In the road sector, the Government has established much of the essential framework, \nincluding institutions and laws. The development and management of roads is one of the \nseveral tasks for which the MOI is responsible. The Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood \nControl  (DRBFC)  under  MOI  plans,  implements,  and  manages  the  development  of  road \ninfrastructure.  DRBFC  is  also  responsible  for  the  operation  and  maintenance  of  the  road \nnetwork. It operates through five regional offices (in Baucau, Dili, Maliana, Oecussi, and Same) \ncovering the entire road network. \n \n11.  In 2003, the Government introduced two laws to regulate and manage the road sector: \n(i) the Basic Law for Vehicle Transport, and (ii) the Road Code. The former covers rules and \nregulations for vehicle registration, road charges, passenger and freight transport services and \npassenger fares, and the planning and coordination of public infrastructure provision. The Road \nCode  covers  traffic  rules,  traffic  management,  the  classification  and  use  of  roads,  vehicle \ncategorization, fines, vehicle emissions, accident reporting, and licensing of drivers. In 2008, the \nMOI, with assistance from Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), developed several \nguidelines  (pavement  guidelines,  concrete  guidelines,  slope  protection  guidelines,  and  a \nconcrete and aggregate testing manual). \n \nB.  Key Challenges \n \n12.  Poor  condition  of  the  core  road  network.  Although the road assets inherited at \nindependence in 2002 were essentially complete, they were damaged in the conflict period and \nare rapidly deteriorating because of the difficult terrain, geology, torrential rains, low design \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \nstandards, and neglect of maintenance. The poor road infrastructure hampers people\u2019s access \nto economic and social services, and the development of industry and agriculture. \n \n13.  Weak planning and implementation capacity. The DRBFC is seriously handicapped \nby shortage of technical staff.3 This has affected its operational capacity for strategic planning, \nprocurement and administration of new infrastructure contracts, and timely maintenance of the \nroad network. MOI is keen to expand its capacity by hiring more staff, but it is constrained by the \nlimited availability of skilled human resources and better incentives offered by the private sector. \n \n14.  Insufficient  road  maintenance  finance  and  practices.  The road network lacks a \nwell-planned routine and periodic maintenance program. The annual maintenance expenditure \nneeds for national roads are estimated at $20\u2013$30 million. However, the Government allocated \nonly about $3.7 million in 2009 for the maintenance of all categories of roads. DRBFC does not \nhave a functioning system for setting performance targets and for planning and programming \nperiodic  road  maintenance  activities.  Most  road  works    on  the  core  road  network  are \nimplemented reactively by the local communities, through DRBFC, but supervisory guidance \nhas not been provided sufficiently and on time, leaving the quality of the works in question. \n \n15.  Difficult terrain, geology, and weather conditions. Terrain, geology, and weather \nconditions considerably increase the cost of providing and maintaining roads. Mountain roads \nare prone to erosion and landslides in the rainy season, while coastal plain roads, especially in \nthe south, are prone to flooding. During the 8-month rainy season from November to June, a \nlarge part of the road network, including large sections of the national road network and a \nnumber of district roads, becomes impassable after heavy rains. \n \n16.  Limited  capacity  of  national  contracting  industry.  Private  companies  have \nimplemented road projects in Timor-Leste, but they are not ready to undertake large-scale road \nprojects  independently.  The  main  capacity  constraints  of  these  contractors  are  financial \nresources and technical and managerial skills. Most of the consulting work for large projects is \nperformed  by  foreign  companies  since  the  capacity  of  local  consulting  firms  is  still \nunderdeveloped.  \n \n17.  Right-of-way. The legal foundation for the right-of-way (ROW) for roads has not been \nestablished in Timor-Leste. When roadworks require additional land, the Government negotiates \nwith the owners or users on a case-to-case basis. Previously, when land had to be acquired for \ncivil works, the concerned parties negotiated under the direction of local authorities and reached \nagreement regarding compensation rates, the total compensation amount, and the procedures \nfor compensation and cash transfer. There are no specific laws or guidelines concerning land \nacquisition and compensation. The first land law of Timor-Leste (Law No.1/2003) was passed in \nMarch 2003 but does not provide a legal basis for declaring customary land to be public land \nbelonging to the state. A new land law being prepared by the Government is expected to \naddress these issues. \n \n18.  Road  safety.  Data on road accidents are scarce and incomplete. Reports on road \naccidents seem to substantially underestimate the actual number of road accidents. This is \nexplained in part by the fact that Timor-Leste does not require car or driver insurance. Thus, \nroad accidents that do not result in injuries are settled between the involved parties, and not \nreported to the police. The Timor-Leste National Police reported that in 2008 there were 1,656 \nroad accidents; of these, 50 accidents resulted in fatalities, 215 in serious injuries, and 1,020 in \n                                                 \n3  DRBFC has only 12 engineers\u2014seven at the headquarters in Dili and five in the regional offices.  \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nother injuries. Many less-serious, unreported cases were not included. The actual number of \ninjuries and fatalities is deemed to be much higher. Accidents are mostly attributed to human \nerror (60% of all reported accidents), road conditions (25%), weather conditions (10%), and \nmechanical failure (5%). The potential for even-higher accident rates is great, considering the \nincreased number of vehicles, many of which are unprotected motorcycles carrying up to four \npeople,  and  the  increased  vehicle  speeds  made  possible  by  economic  growth  and  road \nimprovements. \n \nC.  Government Strategy and Vision \n \n19.  The  Government  of  Timor-Leste\u2019s  current  National  Development  Plan,4 released  in \n2002, places high importance on infrastructure development. The objectives for roads, bridges, \nand flood control are \n \n(i)  identifying the national, district, and rural road networks essential for the support \nof economic and social development; \n(ii)  initiating policies within a legal and regulatory framework to improve the quality of \nlife, encourage private enterprise, and improve access and safety particularly in \nimpoverished areas; \n(iii)  developing  roads,  bridges,  and  topologies  of  flood  control  that  provide \nenvironmental protection and reverse existing ecological damage; \n(iv)  ensuring development and regulation for the safe circulation of transport; \n(v)  ensuring  transport  infrastructure  meets  national  defense  imperatives,  and \nestablishing technical standards for a national road network; \n(vi)  preserving road assets as the first priority through sustainable maintenance and \nlong-term management plans for support systems; \n(vii)  establishing  an  institutional  structure  and  developing  the  technical  and \nadministrative capacity of East Timorese staff to manage, maintain, and improve \nthe road network; \n(viii)  implementing sustainable strategies for maintaining rural access roads; and \n(ix)  establishing and implementing erosion control measures to prevent damage to \nphysical infrastructure and economically valuable property. \n \n20.  The transport sector is currently faced with managing a degraded road network, which \nentails a very high cost for the reactive work needed to keep it functioning.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Road Network Development Sector Project is the first road project in Timor-Leste \nusing a sector-based approach. The approach allows the Government of Timor-Leste to take \nthe lead in identifying, prioritizing, appraising, designing, and implementing subprojects. As the \nExecuting Agency for the Project, the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) will propose, on behalf of \nthe Government, the rehabilitation of priority road links as subprojects for the approval of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The approval of subprojects will be based on satisfactory \ntechnical, economic, social, and environmental assessments against eligibility criteria agreed on \nbetween the Government and ADB.  \n \n2.  The  subproject  selection  criteria  given  here  apply  only  to  the  road  rehabilitation \ncomponent. Other components of the Project will be implemented according to the standard \nprocedures for ADB-funded projects. \n \nB.  Subproject Eligibility Criteria \n \n3.  The selection of subprojects will be guided, first of all, by the medium-term road network \ndevelopment program.1 The project management unit (PMU) will select candidate subprojects \nand undertake stakeholder consultations to investigate the relevance of the subprojects to \n(i) fostering economic development, (ii) improving the quality of life of residents, (iii) serving rural \nand  remote  areas,  (iv) fostering  regional  development  within  the  country,  and  (v) creating \nemployment.2   \n \n4.  PMU will shortlist the candidate subprojects that satisfy the five criteria. The candidate \nsubprojects must meet the following eligibility criteria for funding under the Project: \n \n(i)  Economic efficiency. The subprojects must be economically viable, and must \ndemonstrate an economic internal rate of return of at least 12%. The economic \nanalysis  should  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects.3 As a bottom line, the subproject will be assessed \nfor its contribution to: (a) savings in travel time, (b) reduced vehicle operation \ncosts, (c) potential for increased agricultural production and marketing due to low \nfreight costs and more reliable access, (d) employment of local communities and \nnational contractors for civil works, (e) increased incomes particularly among \npoor and rural households, and (f) risk mitigation benefits due to climate change \nadaptation measures. \n(ii)  Environment impact. Subproject environmental selection criteria will exclude \nsubprojects that are likely to cause major environmental impact (environmental \ncategory  A),  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental  guidelines.  Environmental \nscreening will be conducted for all subprojects. In selecting subproject sites, \nincluding extraction sites for materials to be brought into the construction sites, \nthe following environmental criteria will be used for the first level of screening. If \nany of these selection criteria are found applicable to the site, then the subproject \n                                                 \n1  The program is subject to regular review and revision by the Government. \n2  The five criteria were identified by the Prime Minister of Timor-Leste in October 2008 for the National Infrastructure \nPlan. \n3  ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "32   Appendix 4 \n \nwill not be approved as part of the Project. Subprojects approved for funding \nunder the Project must not (a) be classified as category A in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003); (b) result in significant loss \nof or damage to natural environments, such as forests, reefs, mangroves, or \nother sensitive areas; (c) have a permanent negative effect on a known rare or \nendangered species; or (d) cause permanent damage to irreplaceable cultural \nrelics and archaeological sites. \n(iii)  Land acquisition and resettlement. No subproject that requires land acquisition \nwith significant resettlement impact, according to ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement \nPolicy (1995), will be eligible for funding under the Project. The inclusion of a \ncandidate  road  as  a  subproject  for  funding  under  the  Project  is  therefore \ncontingent  on  compliance  with  agreed  eligibility  criteria.  With  respect  to \nminimizing land acquisition (no permanent and only minimal temporary use of \nland) and its impact, the criteria are as follows: (i) rehabilitation should require no \nland acquisition and no major earthworks or construction of structures; (ii) the \ninclusion  of  the  road  has  local  support;  (iii) the  proposed  works  avoid  the \ndisplacement of residential structures or other, permanent, structures; (iv) the \nroad is located on state-owned land or there is a negotiated agreement with \naffected owners and communities to use customary land; and (v) there is no \nother significant adverse environmental or social impact. \n(iv)  Counterpart funds. MOI will confirm that all funds and resources necessary for \nthe construction, operation, and maintenance of the subproject are provided on \ntime. \n \nC.  Candidate Project Roads \n \n5.  According to the medium-term road network development program in Supplementary \nAppendix A, the candidate project roads are as follows: \n \nTable A4: Candidate Project Roads \n \nRoad Link  From  To  Length (km) \nA02-07  Zumulai  Suai  29.8 \nA03-03/04  Liquica  Mota Ain  78.8 \nA04-01  Tibar  Gleno  33.3 \nA04-02  Gleno  Ermera  11.5 \nA11-01  A04 Junction (Ermera)  Maliana  63.9 \nA19-01  Pante Macassar  Sakato  15.0 \nSource: The medium-term road network development program prepared under ADB. \n2008.

On the basis of consultations with the Government and key stakeholders, two road \nlinks\u2014(i) Liquica\u2013Batugade\u2013Mota Ain, and (ii) Ermera\u2013Maliana\u2014were selected as samples for \nsubproject appraisal. (The feasibility studies for these two subprojects are in Supplementary \nAppendixes B\u2013G.) The road from Liquica to Mota Ain is on national roads linking Dili and the \nlargest border crossing, at Mota Ain. Another road from Ermera to Maliana provides access to \ncoffee farmers and processors transporting coffee, the country\u2019s most important commercial \nagriculture product, to the market. The rehabilitation works will restore the roads on both links to \nmaintainable conditions. All civil works will be carried out within the road alignments to minimize \nthe adverse impact on nearby communities and the environment. \n ", "  Appendix 4  33 \n \nD.

The PMU will conduct stakeholder consultations on behalf of MOI, and report on the \nresults and propose subprojects for appraisal to the MOI. The minister of MOI will endorse \ncandidate subprojects for appraisal. \n \n9.  With MOI\u2019s endorsement of candidate subprojects, the PMU, assisted by the project \nimplementation support consultants, will undertake the required appraisal to justify subproject \neligibility. The appraisal will involve collecting and analyzing baseline data to assess feasibility \nand expected impact, using methods and tools established for the sample subprojects. Each \nsubproject  appraisal  will  cover  (i) a  technical  feasibility  study,  (ii) an  economic  analysis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, (iii) a social and \npoverty analysis in accordance with the method and procedure used in the sample subproject \nfeasibility study, and (iv) an initial environmental examination and environmental management \nplan in accordance with the environmental assessment and review procedure used in the \nsample subproject feasibility study. Each component of the assessment will confirm acceptable \nratings against the criteria, or recommend further works to complete the assessment. \n \n10.  MOI will review the appraisal report and endorse the subproject that meets all the \neligibility criteria. The subproject appraisal report with the endorsement of the minister of MOI \nwill then be submitted to ADB for approval. \n \n11.  ADB will review the appraisal report and, if necessary, may request additional materials \nand studies to justify the subproject. ADB\u2019s formal approval has to be obtained before the \ndetailed design of any subproject, and its inclusion for financing under the Project. With ADB\u2019s \napproval, the PMU will start subproject detailed design and implementation. \n \n ", "34   Appendix 5 \n \nROAD MAINTENANCE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  Road  is  the  primary  mode  of  transport,  which  carries  70%  of  freight  and  90%  of \npassengers. Timor-Leste has an extensive road network of about 6,000 km, half of which are \ncurrently undeveloped rural tracks. The core road network comprises 1,400 km of national roads \nconnecting the 13 districts and 900 km of district roads linking major population centers to the \nnational  roads.  The  road  conditions  of  the  core  road  network  demonstrate  premature \ndeterioration. Almost the whole network needs rehabilitation works to restore the road condition \nto maintainable levels. \n \n2.  Lack  of  road  maintenance,  severe  climate  environment,  and  unstable  geotechnical \nconditions are the primary reasons for the premature deterioration of road network in Timor-\nLeste.  Routine  maintenance  could  efficiently  protect  road  assets  through  timely  clearing \ndrainage and small landslips, regularly removing vegetation, and repairing pavement surface \ndistresses at early stages. Periodic maintenance to reinstate road surface damage by traffic \nabrasion and wet season erosion could help postpone the needs of rehabilitation. The unstable \ngeotechnical  conditions  and  severe  climate  environment  also  contribute  to  the  poor  road \nconditions, but their impact would have been significantly alleviated if proper maintenance is \nundertaken.  \n \n3.  Insufficient budget allocation and weak executive capacity are the two main constraints \nto keeping the road network in a maintainable condition. The needs of annual maintenance \nexpenditure for national and major district roads are estimated at $20 million \u2013 $30 million. \nHowever,  the  budget  for  the  maintenance  works  for  all  categories  of  roads  is  only  about \n$4.8 million in 2009. The directorate of roads, bridges and floods control (DRBFC) of Ministry of \nInfrastructure  (MOI)  is  responsible  for  developing  and  managing  roads,  but  seriously \nhandicapped by shortage of technical staff; it only has 12 engineers, seven in the headquarters \nin Dili and five in regional offices. \n \nB.   Road Maintenance Program \n \n4.  The Road Network Development Sector Project will support the MOI to establish a road \nmaintenance  program  (RMP).  The  RMP  will  firstly  be  implemented  in  three  pilot  districts, \nBobonaro, Covalima, and Oecussi, which are all located at the border to Indonesian West \nTimor. The connectivity in border region is of strategic importance as it provides access for most \ncross-border activities between Timor-Leste and Indonesia, including trade, travel, and family \nreunion.1   \n \n5.  Timely and adequate road maintenance will proactively protect the roads from premature \ndeterioration,  and  effectively  reduce  road  closure  caused  by  heavy  rainfall  during  the  wet \nseason.  Providing  all-season  access  to  the  rural  areas  also  means  the  social  and  health \nservices will not be interrupted and commercial activities will be facilitated. \n \n6.  Establishing an RMP will benefit the country through job creation. About 16,000 young \npeople join the country\u2019s workforce every year, while in rural areas many people are essentially \n                                                 \n1  As  Timor-Leste  expects  to  join  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  in  2012,  the  opportunities  for \ncooperation with Indonesia will be increased significantly. \n ", "  Appendix 5  35 \nin chronic underemployment.2 An RMP will provide business opportunities to contractors and \nthus generate sustainable employment. The generated jobs will be further increased after the \nGovernment takes over the RMP and expands it to all 13 districts. \n \n7.  A functioning RMP is also an important indicator of good investment environment for \nroad sector since it could protect the road assets from premature deterioration. Development \npartners are usually reluctant to provide large-scale assistance to the road sector before an \nRMP is functioning. More donors and development partners are expected to provide assistance \nto road sector development once the RMP is established. \n \nC.  Implementation \n \n8.  During  project  implementation,  the  RMP  will  be  established  in  three  phases  (an \nimplementation framework is in Table A5). \n \n(i)  Phase 1: Program establishment. In the first year, an international consultant \nwill be engaged as the road maintenance advisor of the project management unit \n(PMU) and take the lead in developing the RMP operation manual, developing \nand conducting a training program for small contractors and DRBFC staff, and \nadministering the related consulting services and civil works. A road maintenance \nengineer (national consultant) of PMU and counterpart DRBFC staff will also be \ntrained on-the-job for planning and implementing the RMP.  \n(ii)  Phase 2: Pilot implementation. In years 2\u20133, the road maintenance engineer \nwill take the lead in implementing the RMP in the three pilot districts. The RMP \noperation manual will guide the activities of road maintenance engineer and \ncounterpart MOI staff. In this phase, counterpart DRBFC staff are expected to \nassume  responsibility  of  specific  tasks  under  the  supervision  of  road \nmaintenance engineer. \n(iii)  Phase 3: Transition and expansion. In years 4\u20135, the RMP will be gradually \ntransferred to the responsibility of DRBFC. In this phase, (i) the DRBFC staff will \ntake the lead in administering the RMP implementation in the pilot region, (ii) \nPMU will provide support, mainly through the road maintenance engineer, to \nDRBFC, and (iii) PMU is also responsible for preparing a strategy to expand the \nRMP to nationwide core road network, and propose related institutional setup \nand financing requirement. MOI will review the expansion strategy, approve it, \nand reflect it in its annual budget planning.  \n \n9.  The training program for small contractors will be reviewed and updated before the \nbidding procedure. Participation in the training program will be a prerequisite for contractors to \nbid for road maintenance contracts. \n                                                 \n2  Ministry of Finance. 2009.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nThe Government and ADB signed a poverty reduction partnership in October 2003. The Government\u2019s National \nDevelopment Plan incorporates a poverty reduction strategy focusing on (i) promoting opportunities for the poor; \n(ii) improving their access to basic social services; (iii) enhancing security, including reducing vulnerability to shocks, \nand improving food security; and (iv) empowering the poor. The 2005\u22122006 country strategy and program update \n(CSPU) notes that pervasive poverty and slow social development require a focus on development that will directly \nbenefit the poor.a The country operations business plan 2008\u20132010 concluded that assistance provided by ADB over \nthe preceding period (2006\u20132008) supported the Government in moving toward four specific National Development \nPlan goals, including provision of roads and bridges for the movement of people and goods, orderly and efficient \nfunctioning of markets, and sustainable development.b The Project will continue to provide support to this goal of the \nNational Development Plan by upgrading, rehabilitating and establishing a strategy for maintenance of 32 priority road \nlinks located across 11 of the 13 districts (the two districts without road sections among the 32 priority links include \nManufahi and Viqueque). The Project will commence with three road links\u2014A03-03 Liquica\u2013Batugade (74.3 km), A03-\n04 Batugade\u2013Mota Ain (2.6 km) and A11-01 Ermera\u2013Maliana (63.9 km)\u2014as sample subprojects. Links A03-03 and \nA03-04 are located in Liquica and Bobonaro districts and link A11-01 is located in Bobonaro and Ermera districts. \nUsing the same division of districts as the Timor-Leste survey of living standards (TLSLS), i.e., (i) east includes \nBaucau, Lautem and Viqueque; (ii) center includes Alieu, Ainaro, Dili, Ermera, Liquica, Manufahi and Manututo; and \n(iii) west includes Bobonaro, Cova Lima and Oecussi, the distribution of the priority links is 49% in the center (covering \n88 sucos [villages]), 17% in the east (covering 30 sucos), and 34% in the west (covering 60 sucos). Combined, the 32 \npriority links will improve access for 178 sucos. \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nBased on the latest TLSLS, the official poverty incidence, is derived from two poverty lines; the lower poverty line \n(food/extreme poverty line) is $0.71/person/day and the upper poverty line (minimum basic needs) is $0.88/person/day, \nhalf of the population falls below the upper poverty line and a third of the population falls below the lower poverty line \nThe characteristics of poverty include the following: \n(i)  Poverty incidence is higher in rural areas (52%) than in urban areas (45%), and with three-quarters of the poor \nliving in rural areas.  \n(ii) Children under the age of 15 years account for 43% of the population but account for 49% of the poor. Young \nchildren (i.e., those aged 5 years or less) represent 19% of the total population but account for 21% of the poor. \n(iii) Those with no or only low levels of education account for most of the poor. The poverty rate for people without \neducation is 58%, with a primary education is 50%, and with a secondary education is 34%.  \n(iv) Controlling for household size, households headed by women are poorer than households headed by men. Overall, \npoverty incidence increases with household size but for any household size the incidence of poverty is higher for \nhouseholds headed by women. \n(v) Poverty is concentrated in the central districts (which includes two of the districts in the sample project area\u2014\nErmera and Liquica). The incidence of poverty in the three districts in the sample project area range from 45% in \nLiquica to 55% in Ermera and Bobonaro. Together, these three districts account for 27.4% of the country\u2019s poor. \nThe household survey undertaken for the Project correlates well with the TLSLS data. Using the upper poverty line of \n$0.88/day/person, some 59% of the sample subproject area is poor (compared with 51% in TLSLS) and some 78% \nsuffer food shortages) compared with 79% in the TLSLS). Taking into account the rural nature of poverty, and that most \nof the poor are engaged in low-productivity farming (80% of the total poor and 90% of the rural poor depend on the \nagriculture sector), improving access to markets as well as increasing availability and diversity of farming inputs have \ncredible contributions to make to poverty reduction. At the national level, 64% of the poor, compared with 76% of the \nnon-poor, have access to all weather roads, in rural areas the proportion of poor with access to all weather roads \ndecreases further to 58% (compared with 68% of the non-poor).  \nThe poor will be direct beneficiaries of the Project in terms of improving inferior quality roads and accessibility in all \nseasons, as well as potentially reducing travel times to the closest all-weather roads for those sucos and aldeias \n(communities) included in the linked project Our Roads, Our Future\u2014Supporting Local Governance and Community-\nBased Infrastructure Works, which is proposed to be funded by Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). This will \nsupport improvement of selected feeder roads in rural communities in project areas, as well as enhance involvement of \nthe communities in roadworks and small community infrastructure such as markets. \n \n ", "  Appendix 10  47 \n2.  Design Features \nThe Project incorporates several strategies to facilitate the ability of households and communities to realize benefits \nfrom road improvements and maintenance and, thereby, reduce poverty in the project area including (i) priorities for \nemployment of local men and women for both civil works and routine road maintenance, particularly for poor \nhouseholds and those households affected by any minor resettlement impact; (ii) contractor specifications for provision \nof HIV/AIDS/STI awareness and prevention programs for construction crews and surrounding communities; (iii) a public \nconsultation and participation program linked to different aspects of subproject preparation and implementation \n(including participation in monitoring), to be undertaken by the executing agency and continue the consultation \ncommenced during the project preparatory TA; (iv) a JFPR project, refer below; and (v) a long-term participatory social \nmonitoring study to track benefits among different road user groups and the communities participating in the JFPR \nproject. The Project includes the JFPR project (approximately $3 million with Government cofinancing) to continue to \ntake community empowerment approach, which was commenced under the Road Sector Improvement Project (RSIP).c \nThe key objectives of the JFPR are (i) to extend the socioeconomic benefits of the Road Network Development Sector \nProject to roadside communities, and (ii) to develop a model for sustainable community participation in community \ninfrastructure work with the local government. The proposed JFPR project locations are Bobonaro, Covalima, and \nOecussi. The Project will support (i) community participation in feeder road rehabilitation and maintenance and capacity \ndevelopment of community workers for future basic community infrastructure works; (ii) skills development for rural \npoor and vulnerable groupsd (including poor households, disadvantaged women, unemployed youth) through literacy, \nnumeracy, basic business skills (agriculture and horticulture) training, and raising community awareness through life \nskills program on road safety, primary health and gender; and (iii) support to selected local government units to develop \nan implementation and monitoring model (including capacity development and funding arrangement) for rural feeder \nroadworks. \nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.     Findings of Social Analysis \nThe sector Project will rehabilitate about 232 km of priority national or district road links, and will initially rehabilitate \nthree road links (sample subprojects); Liquica\u2013Batugade link (74.3 km), Batugade\u2013Mota Ain (2.6 km) and Ermera\u2013\nMaliana link (63.9 km). The current population within the catchment of the 32 priority links is approximately 460,000 \nand is projected to be in the order of 1.01 million at the end of the master plan period, i.e., 2019 (based on continued \ngrowth at the current rate of 5.4% per annum), while the 2019 estimated population within the catchment of the two \nsample subproject links is approximately 320,000.  \nThe primary beneficiaries of the Project are the people who currently live in the 178 sucos (catchments of the 32 \npriority road links) to be upgraded, rehabilitated and maintained under the Project. The current beneficiaries of the two \nsample subprojects include about 131,500 people. More specifically, they include the following groups of road users: (i) \nexisting road users, be they vehicle drivers or passengers and/or nonmotorized transport (NMT) users; (ii) households \nliving in communities along, and in the catchment areas of, the upgraded and maintained roads links, who grow and/or \nsell a range of cash crops and other agricultural produce (including livestock); (iii) passenger and goods (cargo) \ntransport service providers and commercial truck drivers; and (iv) small businesses and traders including vendors at \nlocal and/or informal markets, trade store owners, coffee and other produce buyers, and small and medium-sized \nenterprises in the district capitals and towns. National, district, and local (suco) authorities, and key social service \nproviders such as in the education and health sector, will also benefit from implementation of road improvements and, \nparticularly, the ongoing maintenance of roads.  \nThere are 17 languages spoken across the country which can be classified as being derived from one of two broad \nlanguage groups: Austronesian (Malayo\u2013Polynesian) and Papuan (Melanesian). In reality, little or no significant \ndifferences of cultural and social identity exist among the people. While they speak different languages, the only real \nethnic (or cultural) minority is the small number (5% of population) of Muslims in an otherwise overwhelmingly Roman \nCatholic society. In the area of the 32 priority links, some 14 of the 17 languages are spoken. In the catchments of the \ntwo sample subproject roads, five different languages are spoken. \nAverage population density across the country is 62 people per km2, with the highest population density occurring \nbeing Dili (473 people per km2). Two of the sample subproject areas, Ermera (135 people per km2) and Liquica (100 \npeople per km2), account for the districts with the second and third highest population densities. Most households are \nheaded by men (90%). Households headed by women are smaller than households headed by men by an average of \ntwo people (both urban and rural households). The dominant livelihood activities for Timorese households combine \nsubsistence agriculture, cash cropping and raising livestock. About 84% (93% in rural areas) of the labor force (those \naged between 15 and 64 years) is engaged in agriculture; however, agriculture contributes only 26% to gross domestic \nproduct, indicating a very low level of productivity in agriculture. Nearly all households cultivate food crops to meet \nhousehold consumption needs, with the principal cash crop being coffee. Overall, 37% of households grow coffee as a \ncash crop, 68% grow maize or cassava (subsistence crops), and 31% grow rice.  \nOwnership of motor vehicles had not increased significantly between the 2001 and 2007 TLSLS periods (from 1.8% to \n2.9%); however, motorcycle ownership had doubled (3%\u20136.9%) and bicycle ownership remained roughly the same \n(5%). People, especially those in rural areas, walk or use passenger transport to most destinations. Nationally, the \naverage walking time to the nearest motorable road is 14.9 minutes; however, it is significantly longer in the sample \n ", "48   Appendix 10 \n \nsubproject area and it ranges from 19.5 minutes (Bobonaro) to twice as long in Ermera (29.5 minutes). The project \nsurvey data indicates that 60% of the poor and two-thirds of the marginal (15% above the poverty line) are users of \nNMT. The beneficiary profile shows that the main mode of transport for children travelling to primary and secondary \nschool was by NMT (87.8% and 71.1%) while some travelled by bus (3% and 5%) or by other motorized transport (9% \nand 23%). The children from poor and marginal households have farther to travel to school than children from non-poor \nhouseholds. Similarly, a smaller proportion of poor (15%) than non-poor (27%) are located within 0.5 km of a health \nclinic while some 43% of the poor compared with 23% of non-poor must travel between 3.5 km and 9 km to reach a \nhealth clinic. \nImproving access by increasing all-weather road access, reducing travel time, and improving ease of access (providing \nopportunities for improved passenger transport services) will have benefits for key social service providers such as \nthose in the health and education sectors. A comparison of the 2001 and 2007 TLSLS data indicates that while fewer \npeople did not seek treatment for illness due to lack of transport availability (a decrease from 4% in 2001 to 2.6% in \n2007), the proportion of people not seeking treatment for illness as a result of the closest health facility being too far \nand difficult to reach increased from 38% in 2001 to 42.3% in 2007. This was the main reason given, out of five \npossible reasons, for people not seeking health treatment in the 2007 TLSLS. The benefits of improving access to \nhealth care facilities can contribute to improving health and welfare by reducing the proportion of people not seeking \ntreatment (and potentially becoming more ill with consequent economic impact on their households) as well as \nreducing the number of days during which activities are disrupted due to illness. \nThe first HIV/AIDS case in Timor-Leste was detected in 2001, with 43 cases being confirmed in 2007. However, limited \nsurveillance capabilities and inadequate testing could mean that actual infection rates are higher. Key at-risk groups \ninclude mobile populations such as truck drivers, migrant workers, and commercial sex workers. Overall, 48% of \npeople in the country are aware of HIV/AIDS. The level of understanding about the causes of HIV/AIDS, and therefore \nhow to prevent it, varies across the sample subproject areas. The strategies to address social issues and risks \nassociated with the Project, particularly to enhance benefits for different beneficiary groups, are outlined above in the \ndiscussion of design features of the Project and include a contractor and community STIs and HIV awareness and \nprevention program. \nEconomic benefits include (i) opportunities to establish local markets (both as a result of improved national roads, \ngreater accessibility to district and regional markets and towns, increased diversity of cash crops, higher production \nlevels  and  more  direct  sales,  e.g.,  to  coffee  factories;  (ii)  rehabilitation  of  abandoned  coffee  gardens  and/or \nestablishment of new gardens and an expansion of rice cultivation areas; (iii) growth in livestock raising through \nimproved access to veterinary services and better access to market opportunities; (iv) market vendors expect to sell \nmore often, have more customers and be able to expand their businesses; (v) trade store owners also expect to \nimprove and expand their businesses; (vi) increased opportunities to create and/or expand micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises, especially those developed by women and poor households (with sufficient support). Social benefits \ninclude  (i)  greater  accessibility  to  schools  leading  to  higher  enrollments,  fewer  dropouts,  and  better  academic \nperformance; (ii) greater accessibility to health care leading to improved health outcomes for women and children \n(including increased numbers of people seeking treatment for illness due to reduced travel times); (iii) increased access \nto government services including existing services which currently face access difficulties such as agricultural and \nveterinary extension services, as well as new services like electricity; (iv) beneficial impact on food security; and (v) \nupgrading and sealing roads will reduce dust and improve health and living conditions in roadside villages. The \navailability, frequency, reliability and costs of passenger transport services will improve\u2014for operators and truck \ndrivers, as well as for people who rely on passenger and other transport services. These benefits will reach people \nliving in the catchments of the road links, as well as those living directly along the roads. In addition, over the course of \nthe Project, selected feeder and rural roads will be upgraded and maintained in three districts as part of the JFPR \nproject, with attendant benefits for those communities.  \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \nAt the inception stage, a stakeholder analysis was carried out to identify the primary and secondary stakeholders; their \ninterests in the Project, their perceptions of current problems related to road accessibility, and transport services. \nMeetings have been held at the national level with Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI), DRBFC, PMU within MOI, \nInternational Labor Organization (in Dili and at one of their project sites in Bacau), RSIP labor-intensive component \ncontractors in Manututo, Directorate of Land and Property, Bobonaro District Administration, and CARE International. \nA national consultative workshop was held 30 April 2009 which covered all aspects of the Project including the process \nfor selection of subprojects for inclusion and prioritization in the 10-year master plan, phase 2 technical/engineering, \nroad condition assessment, economic analysis, environmental, social, community-based labor outputs, establishing a \nroad maintenance fund, and how the community would be involved. Consultation meetings were organized with district \nauthorities (district administrators; regional and district works departments; community development, health and \neducation advisors; and district women\u2019s networks); along with other local stakeholders including representatives of the \ncommunity sector (local NGOs, etc.) and the private sector (local business households, bus/truck drivers, etc.). \nParticipation strategy included focus group discussions as well as a structured methodology through survey tools \n(household socioeconomic survey, traffic survey, and passenger transport operator survey).  \n ", "  Appendix 10  49 \n2. What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n Information sharing       Consultation      Collaborative decision making      Empowerment \n \n3. Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nMOI, the executing agency for the Project, will engage staff responsible for safeguards implementation including \nenvironmental and social impact assessment, development of management and mitigation plans, and community \nconsultation activities. The PMU, with assistance from a project supervision consultant, will establish a consultation \nprogram for each subproject. The purpose is (i) to inform communities about the Project and, in detail, about the \nsubproject works; (ii) to provide information about the expected benefits and potential adverse impact, as well as \nproject measures such as compensation, environmental management, community-based initiatives through the JFPR \nand labor-based maintenance activities; (iii) to provide a forum for communities to participate in the Project and express \ntheir interests, preferences and concerns; and (iv) to facilitate different aspects of the implementation of the subproject. \nConsultations with communities will take place at different points in the planning and implementation of subprojects, \nand will be designed not only to inform people about the subproject or specific activities related to its preparation and \nimplementation, but also to enable people in the community to ask questions, make suggestions, state preferences and \nexpress concerns. Special attention will be paid to the participation of women and any other vulnerable groups.  \nC. Gender and Development \n1.     Key Issues \nSociocultural factors contribute to low enrollment and high dropout rates of female secondary school (senior) students: \n(i) high female adult illiteracy; (ii) sex segregation in the paid labor force; and (iii) an emerging gender gap in wages, \nhigh maternal mortality rates, and domestic violence. Women have higher unemployment rates (one in four women \ncompared with one in seven men) and lower labor force participation rates (80% for men and 40% for women). Most \nwomen and men labor in the informal sector, but women tend to be concentrated in the lower income-generating areas \nof the informal workforce. More women than men are engaged in activities such as collecting water (79% compared \nwith 65%) and other chores such as cooking, cleaning, washing clothes (87% compared with 39%), and looking after \nelders and/or children (43% compared with 30%), as well as spending more hours per week (in some cases spending \ndouble the amount of time) at each of these activities than men.  \nThe Food and Agriculture Organization/World Food Programme estimates that nearly a third of the population live on \ndiet which does not provide the minimum daily nutritional needs and that 9 in 10 persons experience some degree of \nfood shortage at some point during the year. Food shortages result from a combination of factors: (i) low agricultural \noutput; (ii) high post-harvest cereal losses (up to 50% in upland corn); (iii) distorted food subsidy policies; (iv) limited \nmarket access; and (v) the very limited alternative means of earning incomes in rural areas. The common coping \nmechanisms are to consume less food and to alter the quality and variety of food consumed, such as substituting corn \nfor rice. Another coping mechanism that is ignored is that women forgo food in favor of children and their families. \nSome 28% of women suffer from malnutrition, of whom 7% are severely malnourished and in need of treatment. \nGender-specific benefits of the Project include (i) increase their agricultural production and expand into new crops and \nother agricultural activities like raising animals, and as a result, increase market sales; (ii) improved (faster, and \nperhaps,  cheaper)  access  to  health  care  facilities;  (iii)  road  improvements,  including  rural  and  feeder  road \nimprovements under the JFPR project, will mean their children will have improved access to schools and, in general, \ntheir  communities  will  have  better  access  to  social  services  and  key  facilities;  and  (iv)  targeted  employment \nopportunities as part of feeder road rehabilitation construction crews (32 priority links) and as workers on the JFPR \nproject roads. To support these benefits, additional measures can include (i) footpaths along roads, (ii) safe places to \nwait for passenger transport services; (iii) upgrading of local market facilities or constructing new markets as part of the \nJFPR project; (iv) agricultural extension services that target women\u2019s needs and interests; (iv) training and assistance \nto learn new income-generation and business development skills; (v) training to strengthen roles and capacities of \nwomen\u2019s groups including district women\u2019s networks; and (vi) education and awareness programs in communities to \naddress growing social problems and to target construction workers. \n2.

The resettlement \nframework prepared for the Project includes a range of gender-sensitive measures, requirements for consultation, and \nmonitoring indicators. The PMU will work with contractors and communities to facilitate the participation of women in \npaid work opportunities for road rehabilitation, labor-based maintenance, and on rural and feeder roads selected for the \nJFPR project; and ensure that all Timor-Leste labor laws are respected, for instance with respect to equal pay for equal \nwork and no use of child or trafficked labor. HIV/AIDS/STIs awareness and prevention programs will target women as \nwell as men, including the programs instituted by contractors to reach people in construction camps and surrounding \ncommunities. The JFPR will include a major component to work with women as well as men to provide training and \ntechnical assistance to support income generation and microenterprise creation.  \n \n ", "50   Appendix 10 \n \nIII.

Introduction \n \n1.  This summary initial environmental examination (IEE) has been prepared under the \nRoad  Network  Development  Project.1 The  Project  is  a  category  B  project  since  no  major \nenvironmental impact was identified in the screening. The two subproject roads selected are \nnational  roads:  (i)  Liquica\u2013Batugade  and  Batugade\u2013Mota  Ain  (A03-04),  and  (ii)  Ermera\u2013\nMaliana. The two subprojects have existed for years and are being used for public transport. \nAlthough the assessed subprojects pass through a potential protected area and important bird \nareas (both areas do not have legal protection status at present), they will have no significant \nimpact on the surrounding forests. An IEE has been prepared for each core subproject in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002) and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003). This summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) summarizes the results of the \nenvironmental assessments and describes the potential environmental impact of the two sample \nsubprojects, the corresponding mitigation measures, and the environmental monitoring program \nto be established during project implementation.  \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The subproject road links selected for rehabilitation are important links identified during \nthe  engineering  assessments  and  economic  analyses  for  the  medium-term  road  network \ndevelopment program, under the technical assistance (TA). They will improve local as well as \nregional connectivity. The Project is therefore expected to improve access to markets and social \nservices for the population, support sustainable development, and reduce poverty.  \n \n3.  The Project is focused on (i) rehabilitating priority national or district roads, (ii) engaging \nnational small contractors for national road maintenance works, and (iii) implementing annual \nroad maintenance in three border districts\u2014Bobonaro, Ermera, and Liquica. At the completion \nof the Project, (i) about 143 kilometers (km) of national or district roads will have been improved \nto  maintainable  condition,  (ii) a  sustainable  road  maintenance  scheme  will  have  been \nestablished, and (iii) the capacity of MOI to implement road projects and the road maintenance \nprogram (RMP) will have been improved. A start date of January 2011 is proposed. \n \n4.  The road improvement works will bring the road sections to a maintainable standard by \nrepairing or replacing road pavements, roadside drains, culverts, culvert inlets and outlets, and \nretaining walls as required. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n1.  Physical Resources \n \n5.  Timor-Leste comprises the eastern end of the island of Timor, plus the exclave territory \nof Oecussi and the islands of Atauro and Jaco. Together, these occupy a land area of about \n14,609 square kilometers Timor is the easternmost of the Lesser Sunda Islands, lying 8\u2013\n. \n10 degrees south of the equator and about 500 km north of Australia. The country has a \nmountainous topography, dominated by Mount Ramelau, which bisects the island from east to \nwest. The highest point, Mount Tatamailau, is 2,963 meters above sea level and less than \n20 km from the sea. The island is a continental fragment, composed largely of limestone and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Preparing the Road Network \nDevelopment Project. Manila (TA 7100-TIM). \n ", "  Appendix 11  53 \nother sedimentary deposits. The island is geologically young, with steep and unstable slopes \nand deep valleys, prone to flash floods.  \n \n6.  In many places on Timor-Leste, extremely steep (>40%) slopes are cultivated, often \nthrough  shifting  cultivation.  High  annual  rainfall  in  the  central  highlands,  combined  with \ndeforestation and clearing of land for agriculture on steep slopes without soil conservation, \nproduces land degradation and frequent landslides. Poor farming practices that exacerbate soil \nerosion include cultivation on steep slopes, without mechanical or planted restrictions on water \nflow (lack of contour bunds, live fences, etc), and burning, especially in dry zone areas. Burning \nthe grasslands to flush out game, traditionally practiced in the dry northern coastal areas, \nincreases the risk of soil erosion. The young geological age and the high rate of tectonic uplift, \ncombined with the presence of weak, poorly consolidated strata, produce intractable stability, \nslope failure, and erosion problems in many areas.  \n \n7.  The climate of Timor-Leste is hot and humid or tropical, with large variations in rainfall \nand temperature over short distances because of the steep topography. Broadly speaking, there \nare two annual seasons determined by the monsoon, which varies in length according to \nlocation, the monsoon lasting longer in the south than in the north. The following pattern is \nidentified: the northern monomodal rain pattern, which produces rain during the 4 months from \nDecember, affects a big part of the north and the east; the southern bimodal rain pattern, which \nstarts December and in May, totaling 7\u20139 months per year, affects the southern part of Timor-\nLeste. \n \n8.  Surface water is scarce as most rivers are not perennial. Extensive and continued \nclearing of forests and other ground cover substantially reduces the ability of the soil to retain \nwater and can also be expected to add to the scarcity of surface water. The majority of rivers \nflow only during the wet season, at which time they are very turbid because of the large \namounts of sedimentation washed from the upper catchments. Flooding is a common problem \nin Timor-Leste, especially in the low-lying coastal plains along the southern shores. On a \nsmaller scale, flooding from overflowing rivers can also occur in the project area. \n \n2.  Ecological Resources \n \n9.  The Malesian region, of which Timor-Leste is a part, is recognized as a region of high \nplant biodiversity with an estimated 41,000 plant species, including 70% of species endemic to \nthat region. From an assessment of other islands in the region, it can be predicted that the flora \nof Timor Island should consist of around 2,500 species of vascular plants. The composition of \nthe flora of Timor is influenced by its location in Central Malesia (Wallacea), a transition zone \nbetween  the  main  rainforest  blocks  of  the  Sunda  (Peninsular  Malaysia,  Sumatra,  Borneo, \nWest Java) and Sahul (New Guinea) shelves. The flora of Timor is characterized by low levels \nof endemic genera (three); at the species level, endemism is estimated at 10.3%.  \n \n10.  Some 224 species of birds have been observed in Timor-Leste. Of these, seven species \nand two genera are endemic to the island. The non-bird terrestrial fauna of Timor-Leste is poorly \nknown, with recent surveys discovering new species of bats, frogs, geckos, and skinks, but the \navailable evidence indicates that there are high levels of endemism in all faunal groups. While \nroughly half of the bird fauna originates from Asia and half from Australasia, the mammal, \namphibian,  and  reptile  faunas  are  dominated  by  Asian  families  and  species.  At  least \n52 mammal species occur in Timor-Leste, mostly small and mobile species. There are 15\u2013\n20 amphibian species and 40 or more reptiles in Timor-Leste.  \n \n11.  The National Directorate for Forestry under the Ministry for Agriculture, Forestry and \nFisheries has prepared a list of 30 potential protected wild areas (March 2009). All of these \n ", "54   Appendix 11 \n \nareas are in various stages of biological assessment and planning, and most of them have not \nyet been systematically surveyed for lack of personnel and funds. These areas still do not have \nlegal conservation status. The process of identifying, proposing, and appointing areas as sites \nthat are protected by law has so far resulted in one area, Nino Konis Santana, at the country\u2019s \neastern extremity being formally recorded as a national park. This area is likely to be managed \nin a way to allow activities in accordance with laws and tradition by local communities. BirdLife \nInternational\u2019s important bird area program had identified a total of 16 terrestrial important bird \nareas in 2007.  \n \n3.  Economic Development \n \n12.  Timor-Leste  has  a  population  of  about  1,080,700  (2008  figure,  from  2004  census \nprojection) and an annual population growth rate (2001\u20132004) of 5.3%. The median age is \n18.3 years and life expectancy at birth is 55.5 years, well below the average for East Asian and \nPacific Island countries. On average, seven children are born to each woman, for a very high \nfertility rate (2004 census). \n \n13.  Timor-Leste is one of the poorest countries in the world. The majority of the rural \npopulation  (78%)  participates  in  the  subsistence  economy.  Subsistence  agriculture  is \ncharacterized by shifting cultivation using the slash-and-burn method. A small amount of income \nis generated by selling cash crops such as coffee, vegetables, and fruits. Numerous varieties of \ntropical root crops and green vegetables are cultivated in this manner. Most of the harvest is for \nhome consumption, but part of it is sold at regular local market outlets depending on demand. \nRoadside marketing is very common along all roads surveyed. Local residents trade their \nproduce for cash with locals and the traveling public.  \n \nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impact and Mitigation Measures \n \n14.  The subprojects were screened for potential environmental impact, with the help of the \ngeographic information system and environmental sensitivity mapping tools. The Timor-Leste \nenvironmental sensitivity map was developed through a scoring-based method, where for each \nenvironmental input dataset (land cover, slope class, geological stability, and biological values) \na score (numerical value) was assigned on the basis of a selected set of classes. The score for \neach class was assigned by expert judgment, with a score of \u201c1\u201d representing the lowest value \nor  very  low  sensitivity  and  a  score  of  \u201c10\u201d  being  the  highest  value,  reflecting  very  high \nenvironmental sensitivity to change. \n \n15.  The environmental impact of the Project will be generally minor to moderate as the \nworks are expected to involve only the rehabilitation and reconstruction of existing roads within \nthe existing road corridors (pavement plus road shoulders). The potential environmental impact \nassociated with the subprojects will occur particularly during pre-construction, construction, and \noperation, and will typically involve the following.  \n \n16.  Impact  on  potential  protected  areas.  During  project  preparation  the  necessary \nattention will be given to protecting the natural environment in connection with the rehabilitation \nand maintenance activities. Improved roads will facilitate access to sensitive areas previously \nprotected by difficult access. This indirect impact will be experienced after construction and will \nbe  considered  in  the  environmental  assessment.  In  Timor-Leste,  the  establishment  of  a \nprotected area network is ongoing; new protected areas are therefore likely to be announced in \nthe future.  \n \n17.  Geological  instability  and  soil  erosion.  Geological  instability  on  slopes  is  an \nimportant  environmental  sensitivity  consideration  for  roadworks,  especially  in  Timor-Leste. \n ", "  Appendix 11  55 \nWhen roads are built in geologically unstable areas, slope failures and shifts will damage or \nblock roads and make repairs difficult. Lack of proper road maintenance during operations \naggravates environmental impact in geologically unstable zones more than in stable zones. \nVery  wet  conditions  especially  during  the  monsoon  period,  in  part  of  the  country  (2,500 \nmillimeters  of  rainfall) can  trigger slope  failures.  In  many  areas,  construction  activities  are \nfeasible only during the dry season. Slope stabilization with engineering and bioengineering \nsolutions and other soil erosion control measures will be undertaken to minimize the problem; at \nthe same time problems of sedimentation and storm water runoff during road construction and \noperation  will  be  addressed.  The  Project  Management  Unit  (PMU)  will  strictly  enforce  the \ndisposal of surplus soil material from construction at designated, environmentally safe disposal \nor fill sites.  \n \n18.  Quarry selection and management. The Project will require materials extraction sites \nfor the reconstruction. Granular material is likely to be extracted from rivers where arrangements \nfor materials extraction are already established. To select and manage quarries appropriately, \nthe long-term impact of quarrying and gravel extraction will be assessed and mitigated. As part \nof the standard project procedures, the contractor can select the quarry site, but the PMU will \nneed to approve the sites and a quarrying and extraction plan before the start of the extraction, \nin line with the regulatory guidelines of by the Government. The approval of the quarrying and \nextraction plan will consider both the quality and the suitability of the materials, and also the \nenvironmental impact of the specific quarrying site. \n \n19.  Management  of  stockpiles,  spoil  heaps,  and  batters.  To  ensure  that  dust  and \nsediment  runoff  are  minimized,  stockpiles,  spoil  heaps,  and  batters  need  to  be  managed \nproperly. Suitable sites for stockpiling and disposal of material will be determined in the detailed \ndesign stage and will preferably be a location where any long-term stockpiles of sediment can \nbe  stabilized  by  vegetation.  The  chosen  disposal  sites  will  be  set  back,  away  from \nwatercourses, drainage lines, and steep or unstable slopes. Any adverse impact will therefore \nbe minimal and temporary. \n \n20.  Air quality. Major earthworks are not expected, but there is possibility of increasing \ndust during construction. The impact of emissions is not expected to be significant because \nthese will be for a very short duration. \n \n21.  Noise.  Construction  activities  may  cause  noise  impact  for  a  short  duration. \nNonetheless,  all  mechanical  equipment  (e.g.,  excavators,  drills,  stone  crushers,  concrete \nmixers) will be provided with noise reduction devices such as mufflers where appropriate and, \nwhen  deemed  necessary,  with  buffers  and  other  noise  abatement  measures  to  minimize \nnuisance to nearby sensitive receptors. \n \nE.   Environmental Management Plan \n \n22.  The environmental management plan (EMP) is designed to ensure that the mitigating \nmeasures recommended to prevent or control the negative impact of the different aspects of the \nproject on environment, life, and property are properly followed, while the positive impact is \nenhanced to gain maximum benefits from the Project. A copy of the EMP is presented in the \nIEE report.  \n \n1.  Pre-construction \n \n23.  During the preparation of the detailed design for the road sections, further attention will \nbe given in protecting potential environmentally sensitive areas and in minimizing negative \nimpact on sensitive ecosystems or the natural environment through the use of environmentally \n ", "56   Appendix 11 \n \nsound design. Subproject selection criteria will ensure that the subprojects do not harm any \necologically or culturally sensitive areas. This is to avoid (i) significant loss or damage to natural \nenvironments, such as lakes, rivers, forests, reefs, mangroves, or other sensitive coastal areas; \n(ii) permanent  negative  effect  on  known  rare  or  endangered  species;  and  (iii)  permanent \ndamage  to  irreplaceable  cultural  relics  and  archaeological  sites.  Road  construction  and \nrehabilitation projects can lead to changes in the community or social environment around the \nroad,  influencing  various  aspects  of  lifestyles,  travel  patterns,  and  social  and  economic \nactivities. ADB policies for land acquisition and resettlement will be applied when dealing with \nthese issues during the pre-construction phase. \n \n2.  Construction \n \n24.  Construction-related activities include (i) removal and disposal of excess construction \nmaterial, spoil material, and debris; (ii) control of erosion; (iii) storage and handling of materials \nincluding fuel and lubricants; (iv) management of construction camps; (v) control of noise and \ndust from construction activities; (vi) measures to ensure worker and community health and \nsafety; and (vii) management of solid and liquid waste. Construction impact will be short term \nand can be mitigated by addressing the EMP requirements. Of particular importance in Timor-\nLeste are mitigation measures to control slope failure and related erosion, sedimentation, and \npolluted storm water impact in areas of high geological instability. In these areas, construction \nshould  be  carried  out  only  in  dry  weather,  with  revegetation  and  bioengineering  solutions \napplied where appropriate. \n \n25.  The  mitigation  measures  include  (i) proper  handling  of  stockpiles,  spoil heaps,  and \nbatters; (ii) proper storage and handling of petroleum products; (iii) provision of on-site sanitary \nfacilities;  (iv) spraying  of  sources  of  dust;  (v) proper  maintenance  of  all  machineries; \n(vi) limitation of work hours to the daytime; and (vii) installation of noise abatement measures \nwhere necessary to minimize nuisance to nearby settlement areas. The implementation of the \nEMP will be the responsibility of the MOI through the contractor, supervised by the PMU of MOI \nwith  the  support  of  the  project  implementation  support  consultants.  An  international \nenvironmental specialist and a national environmental specialist will be part of the consulting \nteam, supporting the PMU in the strict enforcement of the EMP. \n \n3.  Operation  \n \n26.  Adequate routine maintenance is required to minimize environmental impact during \noperation.  This  refers  to  activities  such  as  grading,  grass  cutting,  drain  clearing,  pothole \npatching, and shoulder repairs, which are performed at regular intervals. Periodic maintenance \nactivities are typically scheduled over several years and include resurfacing and bridge repairs. \nOther  periodic  maintenance  activities  are  seasonal  maintenance  such  as  flood  repairs, \nemergency maintenance to reinstate roads after major failures, and the regular upkeep of safety \nfeatures  and  road  signs.  Environmental  impact  from  maintenance  activities  is  commonly \ninsignificant. Noise originating from roads operation cannot be considered a major concern, as \ntraffic volumes are generally low.  \n \nF.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n \n27.  The Executing Agency for the Project will be MOI. The overall sector project will be \noverseen  by  the  minister  of  infrastructure.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation. A consulting firm (project implementation support consultants) will be engaged \nto work with the PMU. The PMU will conduct subproject feasibility documentation, design, \nsupervision,  and  other  aspects  of  project  administration  as  described  in  the  report  and \nrecommendation of the President. Its tasks will also include the environmental management of \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \nthe Project in compliance with the Government\u2019s and ADB\u2019s requirements, and the training and \ncapacity building of MOI staff in environmental management and monitoring. Considering MOI\u2019s \nstaff  constraints,  existing  engineers  and  officers  (3  regional  engineers  and  13  district \nsupervisors) will also be trained to handle the environmental management of the Project. They \nwill  be  engineer-cum-environmental  officers  of  the  Project  responsible  for  overseeing \nenvironmental management at the sites. \n \n28.  Monitoring will relate to compliance with construction contracts, the state of health of the \nnearby environmental resources, and the effectiveness of mitigation measures and complaints. \nThe  project  costs  for  the  subprojects  incorporate  a  budget  and  the  resources  needed  to \n(i) undertake  environmental  mitigation  measures  as  required,  and  (ii) monitor  the \nimplementation  of  EMPs.  The  responsibility  for  undertaking  the  monthly  monitoring  and \npreparing the quarterly monitoring report on the implementation of the EMP will rest with the \nperson  in  the  PMU/project  implementation  support  consultant  team  assigned  to  the \nenvironmental management of the Project. Progress reports will be submitted quarterly to the \nNational Directorate for Environmental Services of the Government and every 6 months to ADB. \n \nG.  Public Information and Information Disclosure \n \n29.  A public consultation was held on 30 April 2009. Over 40 participants from various \ndepartments  of  the  Government,  international  and  national  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs),  international  development  agencies,  and  district  administrations  attended  the \nworkshop. The participants were actively involved in discussions related to poverty reduction, \nthe Project\u2019s goals, and environmental issues. As the opportunity arose, local stakeholders were \nconsulted and informed before and during the field visits to proposed subproject roads. They \nstated that road deteriorations are mainly caused by poor maintenance of drainage and too-few \nculverts and bridges, and expressed their interest in being consulted further during design and \nimplementation. On the side of the Government, officers from the Ministry of Economy and \nDevelopment, the National Directorate for Environmental Services (at the central and district \nlevels),  and  the  Directorate  for  Protected  Areas  and  National  Parks  under  the  Division  of \nForestry of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry should be included in this process. \n \n30.  The disclosure of environmental assessment documents will follow the procedures of \nADB and the Government, including the provision in ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy \n(2005) requiring the disclosure of the relevant environment information in an appropriate form, \nmanner, and language and at an accessible location to be understandable to the affected \npeople and local NGOs.  \n \nH.  Environmental Assessment Review Procedure \n \n31.  An environmental assessment review procedure has been prepared. It presents the \ngeneral  anticipated  environmental  impact,  subproject  selection  criteria,  and  subproject \nenvironmental  procedure.  It  will  guide  the  preparation  and  approval  of  environmental \nassessments of future subprojects likely to be financed under the Project, in compliance with the \nGovernment\u2019s as well as ADB\u2019s environmental requirements. The MOI as the Executing Agency \nwill be responsible for the implementation of the environmental assessment review procedure \nincluding the preparation of the subsequent IEE or SIEE, and the implementation of EMP and \nthe  environmental  monitoring  plan.  Public  consultations  will  be  carried  out  during  the \npreparation of the IEE for future subprojects, and MOI will submit the required documentation to \nADB.  \n \n32.  The PMU in MOI will prepare an IEE for each future subproject submitted to ADB for \nreview and clearance prior to contracting or the start of work. The PMU will obtain approval from \n ", "58   Appendix 11 \n \nthe  National  Directorate  for  Environmental  Services    according  to  the  requirements  of  the \nGovernment before the start of construction. In addition, the PMU will ensure that the EMP and \nthe required mitigation measures for construction activities are included in the contractors\u2019 \ncontracts, with requirements to update the EMP in response to any unexpected impact. MOI will \nensure that the EMP and all mitigation measures during construction are fully implemented. \n \n33.  During  the  implementation  of  the  Project,  ADB  will  review  the  environmental \nassessment reports for future subprojects submitted for approval, disclose the environmental \nassessments  where  necessary,  and  monitor  the  EMP  implementation  and  conduct  due \ndiligence  as  part  of  the  review  of  the  Project.  ADB  will  assist  MOI  in  carrying  out  its \nresponsibilities and building capacity, and ensure that MOI conducts the required consultations \nwith project-affected groups and local NGOs, providing accessible relevant information on the \nProject\u2019s environmental issues according to ADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy. \n \nI.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n34.  From the IEE, it can be concluded that significant or irreversible impact is unlikely, and \nthe subprojects assessed comply with ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard policies. All potential \nenvironmental concerns listed in the EMP can be mitigated. Subsequently, the EMP provides \nsufficient guidance for the PMU to successfully monitor the implementation of the EMP and \nreport on environmental compliance. \n \n35.  Although  the  proposed  road  rehabilitation  subprojects  are  located  or  pass  through \npotential protected areas and important bird areas (both areas do not have legal protection \nstatus at present), the road rehabilitation will have no significant impact on the surrounding \nforests. This is primarily because the subprojects concern existing roads and minor to moderate \ninterventions. The works can generally be carried out within the existing road reserve, and no \ndisplacement of people will be necessary. Provided the requirements of the EMP to mitigate \npotentially adverse impact during subproject construction are met, there will be no significant or \nlong-term impact on the forested area, and no additional or special studies are needed. There \nwill be a replanting program to replace cut trees. No significant associated or cumulative impact \nis identified.  \n \n36.  The alternative option to implementation of this project is not to rehabilitate the roads\u2014\nthe \u201cdo-nothing\u201d option. This option is not acceptable as it will not prevent further deterioration \nand collapse of the roads and will potentially have a significant impact on remote rural villages \nthat rely on the roads for transport and access to markets and social services. \n \nJ.  Conclusion \n \n37.  The results of the IEE indicate that the subprojects will have no major environmental \nimpact and that all environmental impact can be mitigated to an insignificant level. The costs of \nenvironmental mitigations and monitoring are included in the project budget. Therefore, a more \ndetailed environmental impact assessment is not warranted, and the IEE will be finalized as the \nfinal environment assessment of the subprojects.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 12  59 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK \n1.  A  resettlement  framework  has  been  prepared  for  the  Project  in  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s law and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). These documents provide \nguidance to establish the policies and procedures for payment of compensation to affected people \nfor lost or damaged assets and minor land acquisition. During the preparation of each batch or \ngroup of subprojects, the policies and provisions of the resettlement framework will be reviewed \nand, as required, updated to reflect the conditions and requirements for upgrading roads, but \nwithout lowering the standards set out in the present resettlement framework. \n \n2.  Assurances. One of the loan assurances for the Project, agreed by the Government and \nADB, states that no subproject may require land acquisition that will incur significant resettlement \nimpact. Therefore, the Project is categorized as \u201cB\u201d in terms of resettlement impact according to \nADB policy. In case certain subprojects may require temporary land access beyond the existing \npavement, the resettlement framework will set out measures to address such impacts. \n \n3.  Existing land tenure and use. Of an estimated 200,000 land parcels in the country as a \nwhole, less than 25% have ever been formally registered. Origin groups have authority over land \nallocations, including permission for the clearing and cultivating of new land. Within the system of \norigin group authority, there are highly individuated rights to land. It is not accurate to describe \ncustomary land in Timor-Leste in terms of communal or common property only; residential, garden \nand plantation plots are \"owned\" by families rather than the group itself, and generally these plots \nremain under family control. \n \n4.  Screening for impact. The criteria noted in Appendix 4 will be used during a subproject \nscreening  process  to  confirm  eligible  subprojects  among  the  identified  32  priority  links.  The \nscreening process will identify the types and nature of potential impact associated with land \nrequirements and provide adequate measures to address them so as to ensure that the affected \npersons are (i) informed about their options and rights; (ii) included in a consultation process and \ngiven the opportunity to participation in the selection of eligible subprojects; and (iii) provided with \nprompt and effective compensation at replacement cost for loss of or damage to affected assets. \nThe routine and periodic maintenance of roads under the Project will not require the acquisition of \nany land; all maintenance will be carried out within the existing roadway. \n \n5.  Entitlements. The Project\u2019s entitlement matrix was prepared as a part of the resettlement \nframework (Supplementary Appendix N). Affected persons will be compensated for any loss of or \ndamage to land, crops, trees, temporary structures or other assets, as per the policies of this \nresettlement framework. All costs for the Project related to land acquisition, compensation and \nallowances, operation and administration costs, surveys, monitoring and reporting will be financed \nby the Government using counterpart funds. \n \n6.  All people who own crops, trees, temporary structures or other assets on affected land are \nentitled to compensation for the loss of or damage to these assets. Compensation will be paid in \ncash  at  replacement  cost.  In  addition  to  compensation,  affected  persons  are  entitled  to \nassistance, for example, to shift temporary trade shop structures, for disruption of businesses or, \nto move personal possessions. Affected persons will also receive priority for employment for civil \nworks and ongoing maintenance under the Project, as well as participation in the community \nempowerment component in three selected districts.  \n \n ", "60   Appendix 12 \n \n7.  Community consultation. The project management unit (PMU), to be established within \nthe Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI), will organize consultations with each affected community. \nParticipants will include appointed and traditional leaders in the village, affected landowners and \ncommunity  people  affected  by  the  loss  of  assets  on  the  affected  land.  Village  leaders  will \nencourage all other community members to attend including women, elderly people, young people \nand ethnically different population; because women and some ethnic groups are often reluctant to \nspeak in general community meetings, as relevant, separate meetings may be held with them to \nunderstand and discuss their preferences and concerns.  \n \n8.  The key consultations will occur prior to and/or as part of (i) the subproject screening and \npreparation of the subprojects; (ii) carrying out of the detailed measurement survey and social \nsurveys; and (iii) disclosure and review of the draft resettlement plan. The PMU will consult with \ncommunities and affected people on related issues, as required, throughout the process of the \npreparation and implementation of subprojects. Throughout these consultations, the objectives \nare (i) to provide timely and complete information about the project, land requirements and impact, \nto enable people to make informed decisions; (ii) to ensure that all affected persons and other \ninterested stakeholders know and understand the policies and procedures related to additional \nland required to upgrade the road; and (iii) to build and maintain community support for the Project \nby addressing the concerns and preferences of affected persons and other stakeholders. Prior to \ndisclosure, the resettlement framework will be endorsed by MOI as the executing agency for the \nProject. Disclosure of the resettlement framework (or its summary) and resettlement plans will \noccur as per ADB policies. \n \n9.  Grievance redress. The grievance redress mechanisms for the Project will be established \nin MOI to ensure that all affected person grievances on any aspect of land acquisition and/or \ncompensation for affected assets are resolved in a timely and satisfactory manner. Affected \npersons will be made fully aware of their rights (both verbally and in writing) during consultations \nabout land requirements for the Project. In the event of grievances that cannot be resolved \nthrough local mediation, the matter will be referred to the land court system. In this case, the \nproject and district land and property officer will hold the compensation amounts in escrow. \nCompensation will be paid in full upon final resolution of the case in the courts or other forum, in \naccordance with the entitlements of the affected person. \n \n10.  Executing agency. The Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI) is the executing agency for the \nProject. The PMU will monitor and report semiannually to the MOI and ADB on all activities \nassociated with the preparation and implementation of resettlement plans including payment of \ncompensation to affected persons. The scope of internal monitoring includes (i) compliance with \nthe agreed policies and procedures; (ii) prompt approval, allocation and disbursements of funds \nand payment of compensation to affected persons, including supplemental compensation for \nadditional and/or unforeseen losses; (iii) the availability of other resources and efficient, effective \nuse of these resources; and (iv) requirements for remedial actions. \n \n11.  External monitoring. The MOI will recruit a full-time national social safeguard specialist to \nmonitor day-to-day resettlement implementation as well as international and national consultants \nto monitor resettlement issues for all subprojects. The consultants will be recruited and mobilized \nat the beginning of the Project; and will monitor and report to MOI and ADB on all activities related \nto impact on land, community consultations, preparation of resettlement plans and payment of \ncompensation.  The  purpose  of  hiring  consultants  is  to  focus  on  the  social  impact  of  the \nsubprojects and whether affected persons are able to restore, and preferably improve, their pre-\nproject living standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20091030101229+08'00'", "Author": "ADB", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20091124114246+08'00'", "Title": "Road Network Development Sector Project"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \nThe currency in Timor-Leste is the US dollar. \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DRBFC  \u2013  Directorate of Roads, Bridges, and Flood Control \n  EMP  \u2013  environmental management plan \n  ICB  \u2013  international competitive bidding \n  IEE  \u2013  initial environmental examination \n  JFPR  \u2013  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n  JICA  \u2013  Japan International Cooperation Agency \n  km  \u2013  kilometer \n  MOF  \u2013  Ministry of Finance \n  MOI  \u2013  Ministry of Infrastructure \n  NCB  \u2013  National competitive bidding \n  NGO  \u2013  nongovernment organization \n  PISC  \u2013  project implementation support consultant \n  PMU  \u2013  project management unit \n  RMP  \u2013  road maintenance program \n  RSIP  \u2013  Road Sector Improvement Project \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  TLSLS  \u2013  Timor-Leste survey of living standards \n  UN  \u2013  United Nations \n \nNOTES \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY before a calendar year denotes the year in which the fiscal year ends, e.g., \nFY2009 ends on 31 December 2009.  \n(ii)  In this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars.  \n \nVice-President  C.
