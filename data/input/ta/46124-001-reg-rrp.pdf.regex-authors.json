I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan and a proposed grant to the Kyrgyz Republic, and (ii) a proposed grant to the Republic of \nTajikistan,  all  for  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Regional \nImprovement of Border Services Project.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The project supports the CAREC transport and trade facilitation strategy, which aims to \nstreamline transport, trade logistics, customs, and other border control operations to increase \ncross-border  trade  in  Central  Asia.2 From  2007  to  2009,  CAREC  ministerial  conferences \nendorsed a transport and trade facilitation strategy3 and its implementation action plan,4 and a \nplan to address physical infrastructure needs at border crossing points (BCPs) along priority \nCAREC  corridors,  and  to  establish  and  network  national  single  window  (NSW)  facilities.5 \nThe goal was to develop seamless corridors to enhance economic competitiveness of the \nregion.  \n \n3.  BCPs are identified as the major impediments to cross-border transport and trade in the \nCAREC  region.  The  CAREC  corridor  performance  measurement  and  monitoring  (CPMM) \nsystem indicates that in 2012 a typical 500-kilometer journey by a 20-ton truck took an average \nof 19.3 hours and cost $1,068.6 A similar journey in Western Europe takes about 8 hours and \ncosts  $800.7 Delays  are  mainly  due  to  poor  physical  infrastructure  and  inadequate  trade \nlogistics  facilities,  cumbersome  customs  clearance  procedures,  and  limited  utilization  of \ninformation and communication technologies.  \n \n4.  NSW facilities, which enable trade- and transport-related information and documents to \nbe submitted only once through a single entry point, and to be reviewed and processed by \nrelevant government agencies prior to the cargo\u2019s arrival at the border, can provide significant \nefficiency gains. To maximize the benefits of NSWs, coverage should be extended to include \ncross-border electronic data exchange. Many CAREC governments\u2014supported by business \ncommunities\u2014are designing NSWs to accommodate eventual CAREC-wide interoperability. \n \n5.  The benefits of good BCP infrastructure and NSWs can only be fully realized when \ncountries on both sides of the border fund complementary investments, and border control \nagencies cooperate. The project supports the construction and renovation of BCPs in cases \nwhere investments to upgrade complementary facilities on the other side of the border have \nbeen completed or are nearing completion. It will help develop NSWs based on international \nstandards  to  streamline  trade-related  procedures.  The  project  will  be  implemented  in \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Both governments of the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan \naccord high priority to the project. \n \n6.  As landlocked countries, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan need to develop predictable \nand transparent trading environments, improve trade facilitation, and leverage more transit and \ninternational trade to increase competitiveness and sustain inclusive growth. By modernizing \nBCP infrastructure and developing electronic trade platforms like NSWs, they can improve the \nperformance of CAREC corridors, minimize negative impacts of geographic isolation, foster \nmore diverse economic activity, and realize their economic potential. Two road BCPs have been \nselected under the project: the Karamyk in the Kyrgyz Republic and the Guliston in Tajikistan. \nThe BCPs selection is based on the governments\u2019 priority, their special significance for regional \ntrade, complementary development on both sides of the border, and minimal safeguard impacts.  \n7.  ADB support for regional cooperation intersects with the strategies and priorities of the \nproject  countries,  particularly  those  related to promoting  sustainable  growth  and  improving \ngovernance. The project will help improve the environment for trade, which is an engine for \neconomic growth and development. NSW development is consistent with the main priority of \ngovernments to improve governance, reduce corruption by increasing transparency, and ensure \neffective public administration by improving the capacity of the civil service. \n8.  The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan 2012\u20132013 for the \nKyrgyz Republic8 and is in line with the government\u2019s medium-term development program for \n2012\u20132014. The main goal of the development plan is to improve living standards and reduce \npoverty by accelerating economic growth, improving the business climate, and developing an \nefficient governance system.  \n \n9.  The ADB country partnership strategy for Tajikistan supports addressing the most critical \ndevelopment constraints and creating a basis for higher economic growth.9 ADB is committed to \nhelping ensure access to efficient and cost-effective regional transport, developing new export \nmarkets, improving regional customs facilities, and facilitating regional trade. ADB\u2019s strategy is \nto reduce logistics costs for trade and encourage knowledge sharing between Tajikistan and \nother CAREC member countries to foster regional integration and facilitation. Key intended \noutcomes  include  improved  regional  transport  connections,  improved  trade  and  transit \ninfrastructure, and reduced cross-border barriers. The project is included in ADB\u2019s country \noperations business plan 2013\u20132014 for Tajikistan.10 \n \n10.  With ADB support, the Kyrgyz Republic has made an initial $1.1 million investment in its \nNSW11 to complement the development of a customs unified automated information system \nunder the first CAREC regional project loan.12 Tajikistan has benefited substantially from ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012.

The proposed \nproject has incorporated key lessons learned from the past projects: (i) harmonization of trade-\nrelated procedures through enhanced interagency coordination and commitment at the highest \nlevel are prerequisites for the success of NSW development; (ii) adequate capacity of the \ninformation technology staff is the key in achieving technical and operational sustainability of the \nsystem; and (iii) users\u2019 acceptance is critical to smooth operations of NSW systems.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact will be accelerated trade growth within the CAREC region and with the rest \nof  the  world.  The  outcome  will  be  faster,  more  predictable  and  cost-efficient  cross-border \ntransport and trade.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  Border crossing point improvement. The project will improve infrastructure at the \nfollowing two road BCPs to improve working conditions and performance of border management \npersonnel, and reduce processing time and cost:  \n \n(i)  In the Kyrgyz Republic, at the Karamyk BCP, located along CAREC corridors 3b \nand 5, (a) the inspection facilities including customs, sanitary and quarantine, \nand veterinary checkpoints will be improved to handle traffic growth and improve \nthe inspection process; and (b) power, water supply and sewerage facilities, \ncommunication facilities, and office and inspection equipment will be provided; \nand  \n(ii)  In Tajikistan, at the Guliston BCP, located in a key conduit of the regional Osh\u2013\nKhujand  highway,  facilities  will  be  upgraded  and  equipped,  including \ninfrastructure for vehicle inspection and two new border check posts, and water \nsupply and sewerage facilities provided. \n13.  National single window development. This project will support the establishment of \nNSW  facilities  to  streamline  data  submission  to  international  trade  regulators,  and  ensure \nconformity of submitted data with the requirements of business processes in various stages of \ntrade and transport in the international supply chain. International standards will be adopted to \nensure regional interoperability.13  \n14.  The subcomponents of NSW facilities include (i) single window and trade portal software \ndevelopment; (ii) single window backup system and hardware, regional centers, and trade portal \nhardware;  (iii)  certificate  of  origin  and  licensed  track  and  trace  of  system  development;  \n(iv) operating assistance to the single window governance and working groups; (v) business \nprocess  analysis  and  re-engineering  (for  up  to  10  government  agencies);  (vi)  legal  and \nregulatory framework review; (vii) stakeholder engagement and public awareness activities; and \n(viii)  market  study  and  research.  In  terms  of  sequencing,  a  flexible  software  development \nprocess will incorporate possible policy and regulatory changes resulting from subcomponents \n(v) and (vi). \n15.  Project management and supervision capacity strengthening. The project provides \nfunding to engage project management consultants for the project implementation unit (PIU) of \neach project country to provide oversight and supervision.  \n                                                \n13 United  Nations  Centre  for  Trade  Facilitation  and  Electronic  Business  recommendations,  World  Customs \nOrganization database requirements, and World Trade Organization standards. \n ", "4 \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  the  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment  and  Trade  in  Tajikistan  will  be  the  executing  agencies  for  their  respective \nsubprojects.  The  State  Enterprise  Single  Window  Center  in  the  Foreign  Arena  under  the \nMinistry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic (with support of the State Customs Service of the \nKyrgyz Republic), and the Customs Service under the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan \nwill be the implementing agencies for their respective subprojects. The executing agencies will \nhelp the implementing agencies coordinate closely with other government agencies and ADB for \nthe prompt resolution of any issue, expedite the procurement process, organize project steering \ncommittee  (PSC)  meetings,  and  complete  the  project  by  the  established  target  date.  \nThe  executing  agencies  will  designate  project  coordinators  to  carry  out  these  tasks.  \nThe implementing agencies will designate project directors to work with project management \nconsultants to provide overall supervision of project implementation. ADB will organize joint \nconsultations  on  project  implementation  at  least  annually  during  the  CAREC  Customs \nCooperation Committee and Transport Sector Coordinating Committee meetings to ensure that \nthe project countries coordinate with each other closely to complete the project in a timely and \nsynchronized manner.  \n \n21.  Each project country will set up a PSC, chaired by the project coordinator, to ensure \ninteragency cooperation for project oversight. The PSCs will be responsible for (i) guiding the \nproject\u2019s overall policy and strategic direction; (ii) evaluating project performance; (iii) helping \ncoordinate other projects relating to BCP improvement and single window development funded \nby development partners; (iv) serving as a platform to promote private sector participation in \ncustoms and border control improvement initiatives under the project; and (v) ensuring project \nimplementation adheres to agreed schedules. They will meet at least twice a year or as needed.  \n \n22.  Each project country will establish a PIU under the implementing agency. The PIU will \nmanage procurement activities, supervise the implementation of each subproject, prepare and \nsubmit  periodic  progress  reports  to  the  executing  agencies  and  ADB,  provide  secretariat \nsupport to the PSCs, and regularly liaise with the executing agencies and ADB. The PIU will be \nheaded  by  a  project  manager  and  comprise  a  team  of  project  management  consultants, \nincluding procurement specialists, border crossing point supervision specialists, single window \nexperts,  project  performance  monitoring  specialists,  finance  specialists,  and  administration \nofficers. The project manager will report to the implementing agency. \n \n23.

DUE DILIGENCE \n24.  The  primary  stakeholders  and  project  beneficiaries  are  (i)  government  agencies \nresponsible for  regulating  international  trade; (ii)  civil  servants  responsible  for  carrying  out \nborder  management  functions;  (iii)  traders,  truck  drivers,  freight  forwarders,  and  transport \nservice providers engaged in international trade and transport activities; and (iv) communities \nsituated in the vicinity of BCPs that depend on cross-border markets.  \n \nA.  Technical \n25.  Selection criteria for identifying BCPs to be part of the project include (i) government \npriority;  (ii) BCP  along  a  CAREC  corridor  or  of  special  significance  for  regional  trade;  \n(iii)  complementary  development  on  both  sides  of  the  border;  and  (iv)  minimal  safeguard \nimpacts. In the Kyrgyz Republic, the Karamyk BCP is an important gateway in the CAREC \nregion. Based on the volume of transit traffic it supports, its significance is clearly of a regional \nnature. ADB supported the rehabilitation of border facilities on the Tajikistan side of Karamyk; \n ", "7 \nthe project will upgrade facilities in the Kyrgyz Republic. In Tajikistan, new traffic patterns based \non recent economic development increased freight transport. BCPs along these new routes \nneed upgrading. Guliston, in particular needs urgent attention to match renovations made by the \nKyrgyz Republic at Kyzyl-Bel on the other side of the border. The Guliston\u2013Kyzyl-Bel BCP pair \nhas special significance for regional trade given its strategic location in an important Tajikistan, \nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  Uzbekistan  triangle  providing  critical  trade  and  transport  services. \nOverall, the performance of CAREC corridors 3 and 5 is less than optimal. The BCPs are major \nbottlenecks: in 2012, it required 11.8 hours and $147 to cross Karamyk (corridors 3 and 5), and \n1.5 hours and $171 to cross Guliston. \n26.  In  developing  NSW  facilities,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have  carried  out \nimportant  preparatory  work,  including  development  of  necessary  information  technology \ninfrastructure with support from ADB and other development partners. The work provides the \ncountries with solid foundations for developing NSW facilities. With ADB support, the Kyrgyz \nRepublic has made an initial $1.1 million investment in its NSW (footnote 11) to complement the \ndevelopment  of  a  customs  unified  automated  information  system  under  the  first  CAREC \nregional project loan (footnote 12). Tajikistan has benefited substantially from ADB\u2019s previous \ninvestment in a unified automated information system (footnote 12),  Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \nInternationale Zusammenarbeit\u2019s conduct of business process analyses, and a \u20ac2 million grant \nfrom the European Union17 to fund the initial stage of single window development focusing on \ndeveloping  system  specification  requirements.  Substantial  work  remains  to  develop  fully \nfunctional NSW facilities that will maximize the benefits to be derived from, and ensure the \nsustainability  of,  initial  investments.  The  project  was  prepared  in  coordination  with  other \ndevelopment partners. Effective aid coordination will continue during project implementation to \navoid duplication of efforts.   \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  Clear  selection  criteria  were  established  to  identify  BCPs  to  be  upgraded.  NSW \ncomponents  were  identified  using  a  needs  assessment  and  gap  analysis  based  on  work \ncompleted or planned for a specific country. The anticipated economic benefits of the project \ninclude (i) a more informed trade subsector through the information portal, which is a core \ncomponent of a NSW providing traders with access to information about the relevant governing \nregulatory  agencies,  certification  agencies\u2019  specific  documentary  requirements,  and  official \ncosts and times for issuance; (ii) reduced documentary requirements for submission and time \nspent on obtaining regulatory certification from and submitting documents to customs and other \nregulatory agencies; (iii) reduced time and cost for import and export businesses that lead to \nincreased supply chain productivity, reduce waiting time at BCPs, and translate to efficiency \ngains for vehicle operators and passengers; (iv) reduced scope for rent seeking at the interface \nbetween regulatory agencies and traders and/or brokers as a result of NSW facilities, thereby \nremoving the potential for human factor intervention; and (v) increased interest by foreign \ninvestors  as  international  trade  processing  becomes  less  cumbersome  and  more  efficient.  \nThe economic analysis resulted in an economic internal rate of return of 36.37% and net \npresent value of $11.42 million for the subproject in the Kyrgyz Republic; 37.19% and $19.48 \nmillion for the subproject in Tajikistan; and 36.99% and $30.89 million for the project as a whole. \nThus, the investments in the NSW and the BCP components are considered to be highly \neconomically justifiable and implementation is therefore recommended. \n                                                \n17 The European Union-funded project focusing on developing system requirements and software design is expected \nto be completed by October 2013. The ADB project will build on the European Union project and provide support \nfor the NSW hardware and backup system, which will be procured in Q2 2014 to ensure technical compatibility. \n ", "8 \n28.  NSW implementation aims to reduce administrative barriers to foreign trade. Improved \ntrade  facilitation  will  simplify  trade  processes  and  administrative  procedures,  and  promote \ngreater  transparency  and  predictability  in  international  trade  transactions,  thus  leading  to \nreduced costs for foreign trade participants. NSW benefits will be gained at both the macro and \nmicro levels. The improvement of BCPs will generate time savings for freight movements and \neventually have a positive impact on trade. The provision of enabling infrastructure such as \nreliable power supply, water supply and sanitation, and better staff accommodation will lead to \nimproved  staff  welfare  and  productivity  gains.  The  underlying  assumption  is  that  poor \ninfrastructure is causing congestion and delays, negatively affecting trade between neighboring \nCAREC countries and causing decreases in the overall welfare of consumers. Noteworthy to the \nanalysis  is  that  substantial  synergy  could  result  from  the  collective  BCP  upgrades  and \nestablishment of NSWs, transforming the CAREC region from one that has been considered \n\u2015problematic\u201618 to one that welcomes and supports transit traffic. Becoming the land bridge \nbetween Asia and Europe would generate considerably more benefits than are shown in the \neconomic and financial analysis. \n \nC.  Governance \n29.  A governance assessment undertaken during project preparation examined policy, legal, \nand  institutional  capacity  to  adopt  good  governance  processes  for  project  implementation.  \nOver the past decade, the two governments have implemented public expenditure reforms that \ncontributed to improvements in efficiency, accountability, and transparency in public financial \nmanagement. They adopted national procurement laws and strengthened efforts to reduce \ncorruption.  Further,  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  for  the  two  countries  have \nexperience in successfully implementing ADB projects, and in the process augmented their \nfinancial management capacity.19 \n30.  All procurement to be financed by ADB will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). All consulting services to be \nfinanced under the project will be procured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Project implementation, procurement, and \nfinancial management will be aligned with the governments\u2019 standard operating procedures. \nAuditors acceptable to ADB will audit the project accounts annually. The project will strengthen \nstaff capacity in financial management procedures. It will use existing government websites to \n(i) disclose the implementation progress, and bid notifications and their results; and (ii) provide \nopportunities for reporting any corrupt practice. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended \nto date) was explained to and discussed with the governments. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the project administration manuals (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  By eliminating physical and administrative obstacles to trade at BCPs and developing \nNSW facilities with regional interoperability capable of electronic data exchange, the project will \n                                                \n18 See World Bank Logistics Performance Index and World Bank Doing Business Survey, both of which regularly rank \nthe Central Asian countries quite low. In terms of trading across borders (Doing Business Survey 2013), the Kyrgyz \nRepublic ranked 174th out of 185 economies and Tajikistan 184th. In Logistics Performance Index 2012, the \nKyrgyz Republic ranked 130th out of 155 countries and Tajikistan 136th. \n19 The State Enterprise Single Window Center in the Foreign Arena under the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic implemented the Foreign Trade Single Window under the Investment Climate Improvement Program \nSystem Support Project; and the Customs Service under the Government of Tajikistan implemented the Regional \nCustoms Modernization and Infrastructure Development Project. \n ", "9 \n(i) provide and/or upgrade infrastructure; (ii) improve customs services; (iii) create direct short-\nterm  employment20 and  NSW  development,21 and  indirect  long-term  income  generating \nopportunities; and (iv) reduce logistics costs for trade leading to lower consumer prices in the \nmarket, thereby contributing to improved economic development for CAREC residents. \n32.  The project design includes some gender elements. Public health and gender equity \nconcerns will be addressed by designing gender-sensitive BCPs, such as separate washrooms, \ninspection lanes, and nursing areas for women; and providing equal opportunities for female \nborder staff. Development of gender-sensitive infrastructure for cross-border trade will improve \nwomen\u2019s livelihood in border communities, as most local traders are women. \n33.  A  more  liberal  trading  environment  could  result  in  increased  human  and  narcotics \ntrafficking, and rate of transmission of HIV/AIDS and other communicable diseases. The project \nwill augment measures for prohibiting human and narcotics trafficking by providing relevant \ninformation material to border officers and necessary inspection equipment.  \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  The project will not have any adverse environmental impacts or cause any negative \nregional or international environmental impacts. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), the project is classified environment category C. Social safeguard due diligence was \nconducted  during  project  preparation.  The  project  does  not  involve  land  acquisition  or \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts for the components in Tajikistan. However, three households \ncurrently leasing land for cultivating crops at the Karamyk BCP in the Kyrgyz Republic will be \naffected. In line with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement. Affected persons will be provided with appropriate cash \ncompensation for the potential income loss from the leased plots. The details of the impact, \ncash  compensation,  and  its  delivery  schedule  are  provided  in  the  draft  resettlement  plan \napproved by the Ministry of Economy of the Kyrgyz Republic and ADB, and disclosed at the \nADB website on 5 February 2013. No ethnic minority communities will be affected since the \nBCP civil works will be carried out within customs-controlled zones or public land owned by local \nadministrations. The project is classified as category C for indigenous peoples. \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures  \n35.  Sensitivity  tests  indicate  that  economic  circumstances  would  have  to  become \nsubstantially worse for the project to lose its economic viability. Stable economic performance is \nexpected based on the governments\u2019 projections and growth trends. Risks associated with \npotential changes in government policy are moderate. The project is a high-priority supported by \nthe governments. Major risks and mitigating measures (Table 4) are described in detail in the \nrisk assessment and risk management plan.22 \n   \n                                                \n20 About 70 construction jobs (50 in the Kyrgyz Republic and 20 in Tajikistan) will be created.  \n21 About 1,229 person-months of consulting services (107 person-months international and 1,122 person-months \nnational) will be needed. \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement delays   Project  readiness  before  approval,  including  advance  contracting,  and  governments\u2019 \ncommitment to expedite internal approvals.   \nAdopt a design-and-build modality for major procurement packages, as appropriate, to \nattract  better-qualified  contractors,  and  combine  individual  procurements  into  larger \ncontracts to generate economies of scale and simplify project supervision. \nLack of operating and  Government assurances of allocating annual budgetary resources to cover recurrent costs \nfinancial sustainability  related to operation and maintenance of the single window and border crossing points. \nafter project completion  Implementing agencies to prepare operation and maintenance plans. \nEnhance stakeholder engagement and public awareness to generate demand for and \nensure the acceptance of the national single window. \nProvide a focused capacity building program, particularly for information technology staff. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES  \n36.  The  governments  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  Tajikistan  have  assured  ADB  that \nimplementation  of  the  project  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those \nconcerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and \ndisbursement as described in detail in the respective project administration manuals and loan \nand/or grant documents.
