INTRODUCTION\n1. The Office of Environmental Policy and Planning (OEPP) of the Ministry of\nScience, Technology and Environment is responsible for administration of Thailand's\nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures. Bank assistance to streamline and improve\nthe EIA review process was requested by the Government during the country programming\nmission in 19941 and reflects a growing concern among all stakeholders that delays in EIA\napprovals and unrealistic demands for additional information following review of completed EIA\nreports threaten to bring the whole EIA process into disrepute. While substantial reform in EIA\nadministration was offered following implementation of the 1992 National Environmental Quality\nEnhancement and Protection Act, in practice substantial improvement has been difficult to\nachieve for a wide range of reasons.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Environmental Impact Evaluation Division in OEPP handles on average about\n300 ElAs per year, which puts a heavy burden on the 36 relatively inexperienced staff in the\nDivision. Prior to the reorganization of the environmental administration in 1992, more staff were\nassigned to EIA activities, but the Government has put strict limitations on new recruitment of\ngovernment employees, as a deliberate policy to enable them to raise salaries to match the\nprivate sector. Unfortunately, this has not prevented some of the more capable and experienced\nstaff from leaving the public service.\n3. The EIA Division maintains a register of about 37 consultant firms authorized to\nconduct ElAs, advises project proponents and consultants on terms of reference of ElAs, reviews\nElAs in progress, examines ElAs and related documents within 15 days of receipt, is required\nto review final EIA reports and make preliminary comments within 15 days of their receipt, and\nacts as the secretariat to five technical review committees 2 (organized by sector) that have a\nfurther 45 days to review the EIA (and preliminary review) once received from OEPP. The tight\ntime schedules for private sector projects apply regardless of the size of a project or its\ncomplexity. However, in the case of public sector projects to be approved by the Cabinet and\nreviewed by the National Environment Board, these tight schedules are not required although\nOEPP tries to follow the same schedule as for the private sector projects. The pressure on the\nEIA Division to review the detailed EIA reports quickly means that they cannot conduct a\nthorough review by more than one team member, so the quality of the review depends on the\nexperience and expertise of the OEPP reviewer.\n4. Also, the technical review committee (TRC) members are paid only B300 to attend\nthe review meeting, at which they may consider up to 20 EIA reports (particularly in the mining\nsector) and hence they rely heavily on the quality of the preliminary review by OEPP. They often\ncriticize OEPP for an inadequate review rather than the consultants for preparation of a poor\nstandard EIA, which in most cases they have not had time to read. Each TRC has 10-15\nmembers, representing government executing agencies, academia, nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and the secretariat. A quorum for a meeting to proceed is half the\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in April 1995.\nThere is one additional Technical Committee responsible for vetting applications to join the roster of\nauthorized BA consultants.\n-\t \t I\t -\nI\t \u2014 -", "2\nmembers. Unfortunately many government agencies appoint very junior staff to serve on the\nTRC and they feel that they are not sufficiently senior to make a decision without referral back\nto their managers. Each TRC meets at least once a month, meaning that even very dedicated\nmembers (such as NGOs) have very limited time to review the detailed EIAs and make\nmeaningful comment and critical review.\n5. The EIA consultants are required to stand by outside the TRC meeting in case\nthere are questions that the TRC members wish to raise. This is OEPP policy to reduce the time\nconsuming process of EIAs, although consultants and proponents may prefer to participate more\nactively in the review process.\n6. While OEPP encourages public participation during preparation of the EIA, it is\nnot mandatory and most project managers do not permit the EIA consultants to engage in active\npublic participation. Nevertheless there is a clear need for a manual or handbook on effective\npublic participation in EIA. The lack of meaningful public participation during preparation or\nreview of the ElAs is particularly irksome to environmental NGOs, who increasingly are\ndemanding a significant role in the process.\n7. Project proponents are anxious to avoid any delays caused by the EIA process,\nand are also generally unwilling to put significant sums of money into preparation of quality EIAs\n(including meaningful public participation). They see the EIA as simply one more hurdle in the\napprovals process and rarely see EIA as a valuable project design tool.\n8. OEPP is also concerned that there is no standard assessment method and many\nconsulting firms use much more complicated modeling than is really necessary, merely because\nthey own that software. They often run into problems with consulting companies that have\nlimited staff resources and rely heavily on freelance academics. OEPP believes that registered\nfirms should provide more training for their own staff and frequently use academics so that a\ncommon standard in assessment techniques could be achieved.\n9. There is also concern in Thailand that some types of damaging projects are\nexempted from the EIA requirements (e.g., electroplating industries, wastewater treatment plants,\nsolid waste disposal sites, etc.), while other small-scale projects (e.g., all mining proposals) do\nrequire EIAs. There is provision under the 1992 Environment Act for initial environmental\nexaminations, but this has not been used.\n10. There is a lack of follow-up monitoring of ElAs, which means that many mitigation\nmeasures are not actually implemented and in some cases are not effective even if implemented.\nThe lack of monitoring also means that the feedback loop into subsequent design of similar\nprojects is missing. Prior to 1992, most projects were monitored and an annual report was\nprepared. Now OEPP monitors very few projects because of lack of time.\n11. The rationale for Bank involvement in solving the above problems with the EIA\nprocess in Thailand is the extensive capacity building technical assistance (TA) undertaken by\nthe Bank since 1983 in the EIA area. More than 50 environmental assessment strengthening TAs\nhave been undertaken in 18 countries. The importance of improved EIA in designing projects\nwith environment as a primary or secondary objective is also consistent with the Bank's Medium-\nterm Strategic Framework for Development.", "3\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n12. The TA's primary objective is to strengthen the EIA review process so that all\nstakeholders are satisfied that the preparation of an EIA actually improves the quality of projects\nbeing implemented in Thailand. Secondary objectives include (i) improved quality of EIAs;\n(ii) faster turn-around of EIAs by OEPP and the Cabinet and hence less concern over needless\nproject delays; and (iii) more competent reviews of ElAs, which will facilitate (i) and (ii).\nB.\t Scope\n13.\t The scope of the project will include:\n(i) documentation of the current shortfalls in the EtA process as seen by the\nvarious stakeholders, with particular emphasis on the problems during the\nEIA review phase;\n(ii) high level support for the need to reform the existing EIA review process;\n(iii) demonstration of the efficiency improvements made possible by\napplication of the Bank-funded expert system for EIA, through a series of\ncase studies;\n(iv) formulation of a consensus view on the most appropriate changes in the\nEIA review process and development of any necessary regulatory or\nprocedural changes;\n(v) on-the-job and classroom training of the major stakeholders in conflict\nresolution, win-win strategies, quality control procedures, and independent\nthird party monithnng of recommended mitigation measures;\n(vi) preparation of a manual or handbook on public participation in EIA,\nsuitable for sectoral projects in water resources, urban transport, and\nenergy projects;\n(vii) comprehensive review of the structure, membership, guidelines, and\nprocedures of the EIA TAGs, with a view to improving their technical\ncompetence and developing a more efficient and transparent involvement\nin guiding and reviewing EIAs submitted to OEPP; and\n(viii) careful examination of the EIA process for public sector projects, including\nexamination of time schedules for EIA review and approval, public\nhearings before an expert panel, and the use of EIA as a project design\ntool rather than merely an approvals procedure.\nc.viuri\t __:_", "4\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14. The TA will cost $655,000 equivalent, including $390,000 in foreign currency. The\nBank will provide $390,000 in foreign currency and $210,000 in local currency equivalent, while\nthe Government will provide an in-kind contribution equivalent to $55,000. The detailed cost\nestimate is in Appendix 1. The TA will be provided on a grant basis.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n15. The TA will be carried out over a 12-month period beginning in August 1995 in\naccordance with the terms of reference outlined in Appendix 2. The executing agency, OEPP,\nwill appoint the Director, Environmental Impact Evaluation Division as the Project Director. The\nfive TRCs and the EIA Division will be the main focus of training and procedural improvement\nactivities. The National Environment Board will nominate one of its subcommittees as a steering\ncommittee for the TA.\n16. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has agreed to convene a\nhigh level workshop (at Director General level) to secure the necessary support for reform in the\nEIA review process. Such a workshop will be consistent with UNEP's country environmental\nassessment program and they have the facilities in Bangkok for such a workshop as well as\noperational staff experienced in organizing and running workshops. This cooperation is also\nconsistent with the broader long-term framework of cooperation being worked out between the\nBank and UNEP. The Bank will provide part of the funds for the TA to UNEP to implement this\nworkshop soon after the commencement of the TA.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board, has\napproved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of Thailand\nin an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of Strengthening the\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment Review Process in Thailand, and hereby reports his action\nto the Board.", "Appendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES\n($'OOO)\nForeign\t Local\t Total\nCurrency\t Currency\nA.

The consulting firm will provide 8 person-months of input by international\nconsultants with experience in EIA training, public participation, and conflict resolution. The\nproject also provides for 20 person-months of local consultants with expertise in EIA training,\nenvironmental legislation, and public administration. The project budget also provides for\nsecretarial assistance and translation costs. UNEP will be provided with a separate budget to\norganize the proposed high level workshop at the beginning of the project, to present the initial\nfindings on major weaknesses in the current EIA system and to seek strong Government support\nfor reform of the system.\n4. See the main text, paras. 15-16.\n5. The consultants will prepare a combined inception report and existing situation\nreport to be submitted to the proposed high level workshop, two months after project\ncommencement. The inception report will also contain a detailed training program to be\napproved by the Bank. The consultants will prepare a brief report from the workshop findings.\nAfter 6 months, the consultants will prepare an interim report, containing inter alia,\nrecommendations for improvements to the EIA review process, which vill be presented to a\nsteering committee meeting. In the eleventh month, a draft final report will be submitted to the\nBank and the Steering Committee for review. At the end of 12 months after project\ncommencement, a revised final report will be submitted to the Bank and the Government."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090422210105+08'00'", "Subject": "Technical Assistance Report", "Creator": "Envision OCR", "Keywords": "tar: tha 29218, adb ta 2351, adb project 29218, environmental impact assessment, thailand's environmental assessment procedures, environmental impactevaluation division", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3190-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20090918165434+08'00'", "Title": "Strengthening the Environmental Impact Assessment Review Process"}}
