Further,  the \norganization  of  the  health  sector  itself  suffers  from  an \ninappropriate  delivery  system,  inadequate  regulatory \nmechanisms, and inappropriate health care financing methods. \nThe  Philippine  Government  has  established  the  Health  Sector \nReform Agenda (HSRA) to address issues. The HSRA defines \nkey  reforms  and  strategies  that  address  inequities  and \ninefficiencies in the sector. \n \nIn  1999  the  Department  of  Health  (DOH)  was  charged  with \nimplementing the HSRA. Although some reform measures have \nbeen  tested  successfully,  most  of  the  HSRA  strategies  in  the \nareas of health insurance, provider payment, quality of care, and \ngovernance  have  not  been  operationalized  and  tested.  The \nGovernment has requested assistance to fully implement these \nreforms.  \n \nThe Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) comprised two \nloans. A Program loan to support the financing of comprehensive \nsector  reforms  and  a  project  loan  for  implementation  of  the \nreforms in selected provinces. The program loan policy reforms \nand actions outlined in the policy matrix will remove obstacles for \nHSRA  implementation  and  catalyze  future  investments.  The \nproject  loan  will  support  design  and  initial  implementation  of \nreform interventions by local government units (LGUs) level in five \nselected provinces. \n \n \n \n  \n   \n ", "iv     \nThe Sector Development Program \n \n  The  goal  of  the  HSDP  is  to  improve  the  health  status of  the \npopulation,  especially  of  the  poor,  and  to  achieve  the  health-\nrelated  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  of  the  United \nNations. Implementing an integrated set of health sector reforms \nthat benefits the poor will include system-wide changes and the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  project  interventions  in  selected \npilot provinces that build on the HSRA. The HSRA delineates the \nrange of issues to be addressed to accelerate reduction of poverty \ncaused by and contributing to ill health.  \n \n \nImportant Features  The  Program  will  address  the  root  causes  for  the  lack  of \nsubstantial changes since the publication of the HSRA in 1999 by \nputting  into  place  the  appropriate  incentives  for  change  in \nsystems,  processes,  and  rewards.  The  Program  takes  into \naccount  the  lack  of  fiscal  space  available  to  Government  for \ninvesting  in  health  and  in  poverty  reduction,  and  proposes  a \nrefocus of health spending and higher expenditures in areas that \ndirectly benefit the poor. The Program follows a strategy, which \ninvests in people and primary health facilities and that focuses on \ncost  containment  and  cost  efficiency.  The  envisaged  policy \nactions and reform interventions emphasize performance-based \nresource  allocation,  increased  accountability  and  good \ngovernance, and consumer participation. \nThe Program Loan   \n \nObjectives and Scope  The program loan supports the overall goal of the Program by \npromoting  cost-effectiveness  of  health  services  and  equity  of \nhealth status through implementation of an integrated set of health \nsector  reforms.  The  system-wide  changes  will  largely  concern \nimproving  the  ways  that  HSRA  reforms  are  implemented  and \nmanaged at all levels in the health sector. The Program follows \nthree fundamental objectives deriving from the sector analysis and \nlessons learned. These are (i) improving focus on the poor and on \nprimary  health  care,  (ii)  structural  reforms  in  the  sector \norganizations,  and  (iii)  operationalizing  regulatory  reform  and \nimproved governance in the sector. \n \nCost Estimates  The adjustment and other costs of the policy reforms addressed \nby the program loan are estimated to be at least $280 million \nequivalent. \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  The  Program  will  be  financed  by  a  loan  of  $200,000,000 \nequivalent  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  ADB  will  be \nprovided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have an amortization period of \n15 years including a grace period of 3 years, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n ", "  v \nProgram Period and  The loan will be utilized from 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2007. \nTranching  The  first  tranche  of  $100  million  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness, expected in December 2004. The second tranche \nof $100 million is expected to be released by June 2006 (or about \n18 months after the first tranche). Throughout implementation, the \nsteering  committee  and  the  UPMU  will  monitor  quarterly  the \nimplementation of policy and institutional reforms envisaged under \nthe HSDP. In cooperation with the UMPU, ADB will carry out \nsemiannual  review  missions  to  assess  implementation  of  the \npolicy agenda and discuss major policy developments with the \nconcerned  agencies.  Such  missions  will  be  fielded  to  assess \nwhether conditions for the release of the second loan tranche \nhave  been  fulfilled.  To  obtain  the  release  of  the  second  loan \ntranche,  the  Government  will  be  required  to  carry  out  actions \nidentified in the policy matrix as conditions for tranche release, \nand  to  demonstrate  satisfactory  progress  in  implementing  the \nproject loan. \n \nExecuting Agency and  The Department of Finance (DOF) will be the EA of the program \nImplementation  loan. DOF will chair a program interagency steering committee to \nArrangements  coordinate the program loan activities. \n \nProcurement,  The  loan  proceeds  will  finance  the  foreign  exchange  costs  of \nDisbursement, and  eligible  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB's  member \nCounterpart Funds  countries.  Procurement  of  eligible  items  finance  under  the \nprogram  loan  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  standard \ngovernment  procedures  or  normal  private  sector  commercial \npractices  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  Government  will  use  the \ncounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  to \nfinance the costs of implementing the HSRA. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  From 1 January 2005 to 30 June 2007. \n \nThe Project Loan   \n \nObjectives   The project loan will result in more affordable and better quality \nhealth care, and thus increase utilization through cost savings and \noutput  enhancing  health  sector  reforms  in  six  areas:  (i) \nrationalizing health care financing and increasing health insurance \ncoverage  of  the  poor;  (ii)  improving  governance,  operational \nefficiency, and service provision of public hospitals; (iii) increasing \nutilization  of  improved  public  health  care  services;  (iv) \nstrengthening regulatory functions for improved quality, efficiency, \nand  safety;  (v)  promoting  service  integration  in  local  health \nsystems;  and  (vi)  promoting  organizational  effectiveness  and \npublic accountability in the health sector.  \n \nComponents and Outputs  While  policy  actions  will  address  national  reform  issues,  the \nproject loan will create outputs related to the five principle reform \nareas and support cultural change in the health system. Through \nthe special purpose entity, nominated as the Municipal Finance \n ", "vi     \nCorporation (MFC), it will also finance required investments of \nDOH and LGUs. Conditions suitable for project implementation \nexist in five provinces surveyed during project preparation: Ifugao, \nIlocos  Norte,  Nueva  Vizcaya,  Oriental  Mindoro,  and  Romblon. \nFinal  selection  of  participating  areas  will  be  conducted  on  a \ncompetitive basis, based on willingness and capacity to undertake \nthe required reforms. In the selected provinces, support will be \nprovided to cities and municipalities with the highest incidence of \npoverty. \n \nCost Estimates  Five provinces have been surveyed and are eligible for project \nsupport: three neighboring provinces in the north of Luzon (Ifugao, \nIlocos Norte, and Nueva Vizcaya); and two poor island provinces \n(Oriental  Mindoro  and  Romblon).  The  Project  will  have  five \ncomponents: health sector governance, regulatory reform, local \nhealth sector reform, hospital reform, and public health reform. \n \nProject  costs  of  the  investment  package  for  five  selected \nprovinces are estimated at $23.3 million equivalent. \n \n  ($ million)\nFinancing Plan   Source  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange Currency  Cost \nADB    6.25   6.75  13.00  56 \nGovernment   0.00  10.33  10.33  44 \n  Total   6.25  17.08  23.33  100 \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The project loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period \nof 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. \n   \nAllocation and Relending  Participating LGUs will share the costs of the Project in terms of \nTerms  counterpart funds for civil works and equipment in accordance \nwith their fiscal capacity of borrowing.  MFC will lend to LGUs at \nmarket interest rates. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   From 1 February 2005 to 30 June 2011 \n   \nExecuting Agency  DOH will be the executing agency for the project loan. \n   \nImplementation  The Bureau of International Health Cooperation of DOH through \nArrangements  the  Unified  Project  Management  Division  (UPMD)  will  be \nresponsible for overall management under the overall guidance of \na program inter-agency steering committee, headed by the DOH \nsecretary.  UPMD  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of  management \nconsultants  comprising  the  unified  project  management  units \n(UPMU). At the provincial level, project management units (PMUs) ", "  vii \nwill be responsible for the implementation of the Program with the \ngovernor as the provincial project director, assisted by teams of \nmanagement and technical consultants. The MFC will establish a \nPMU to assess and administer loans to the LGUs. \n   \nProcurement  DOH,  through  UPMD  and  the  LGUs,  will  procure  goods  and \nservices.  Equipment  (medical  and  non-medical),  vehicles,  and \nsupplies will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, on the basis of international competitive bidding for \ncontracts  over  $500,000,  international  shopping  and  local \ncompetitive  bidding  for  contracts  between  $100,000  and \n$500,000, or direct purchase. Civil works will be partially funded \nand  contracted  by  the  local  governments.    For  civil  works, \ncontracts of over $2 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding,  all  other  contracts  will  be  based  on  local \ncompetitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  DOH,  through  UPMD,  will  engage  international  and  domestic \nconsultants,  either  individually  or  through  consulting  firms. \nRecruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB \nfor  domestic  consultants.  ADB\u2019s  Quality-  and  Cost-Based \nSelection method will apply for consulting firms. \n   \nBenefits and  The main benefits will be (i) reduced poverty and improved health \nBeneficiaries  status  of  the  poor,  (ii)  improved  governance  (iii)  consumer \nempowerment, and (iv) strengthened local government capacity. \nThe  main  beneficiaries  will  be  poor  people  who  benefit  from \nexpanded health insurance coverage and from improved access \nto and higher quality of health service.  \n \n  The HSDP will contribute to the overall reform process as defined \nby  the  HSRA.  In  particular,  it  will  facilitate  changes  in \norganizational  and  professional  cultures,  introduce  continuous \nimprovement processes, and empower health service personnel \nand consumers. The Project loan will benefit over 725,000 people \nin selected LGUs in the Philippines by upgrading local health care \nservices and facilities and increasing access to care. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Although  supported  and  endorsed  by  leading  advocates  and \nanalysts in the health sector in the Philippines, the main risk is \nthat the reform approach of the HSRA and the Program will not be \naccepted by those that carry the main responsibility for program \nimplementation, particularly the hospitals and LGUs. The HSDP is \nstructured  to  offer  the  appropriate  incentives  for  these \nstakeholders  and  to  mitigate  this  risk.  Capacity  constraints  in \nLGUs will require support from DOH. The HSDP has resources to \nundertake the required capacity building for HSRA implementation \nin its areas of focus. \n   \n \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Republic of the Philippines for the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP). The \nprogram framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n \n  1.  Sector Structure and Financing \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s role and presence in the health sector is a constitutional mandate. \nUnder the 1987 Constitution, health is both an objective of, and the instrument to, achieve \neconomic development. To fulfill its constitutional mandate, each government administration \noutlines,  among  others,  its  health  objectives,  policies  and  strategies  in  the  Medium  Term \nPhilippine Development Plan\u2014the master plan on which the specific objectives, programs, \nactivities and projects of each government agency are anchored. According to the 2000\u20132004 \nplan, Filipinos of all ages should have access to health, nutrition, and population management \nservices that are essential to achieve full human potential leading to a sustainable improvement \nin the quality of life. The sector analysis is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n3.  The Philippine Government has not provided sufficient support to meet the health care \nneeds of the poor. Total health expenditure in 2001 was estimated at P119.4 billion, 3.5% of \ngross domestic product. Of this, 75.8% was spent on personal curative health care and only \n13.2% on public health (the balance being used in research, training, and administrative costs). \nPublic health is only 31% of the Government health budget, while curative health is 48%, which \nmeans that the Government is directly providing support for curative services at provincial and \nteaching hospitals that could more efficiently be provided at a much lower level of the health \nsystem. The Government spends 6.2% of its budget on health, and only 0.8% on public health \nprograms. It seems unlikely in the current economic climate that the percentage allocated to \nhealth can be increased or that the total Government budget will expand. However, the amount \nallocated to public and preventive health (which disproportionately benefits the poor) is very low \nand a reallocation of the currently available funds can have a significant impact on the delivery \nof services for the poor. Curative/personal health expenditures are paid mainly from household \nout-of-pocket sources, with social insurance covering only 9% of the costs (2001). The national \nGovernment covers 12% of curative costs and local government 9%. Household out-of-pocket \nspending amounted to 42.8% of total health expenditures, while social health insurance spent \nP9.3 billion, or only 7.8% of the total. Government sources (national and local governments) \naccounted for 37.4% of total health care spending. Efficiency in the system would be improved if \nadditional  costs  for  curative  care  could  be  shifted  from  the  national  Government  to  local \ngovernments by providing first-line curative services and referral at the barangay health stations \n(BHSs) and rural health units (RHUs) instead of burdening the Department of Health (DOH)-\nretained hospitals with this level of health care. The percentage of curative personal health care \ncovered by social insurance should be greatly increased and increased amounts of government \nhealth funds allocated to public and preventive health programs. \n \n4.  For the wide variety of public, private and non-profit hospitals, clinics, and medical \npractices, financing sources include local and central governments, various agencies within \ngovernments, locally and centrally operated health insurance schemes, foreign and in-country \n ", "2    \ndonations, and several channels of formal and informal self-pay. The private health sector is \nfinanced principally from user fees and health insurance proceeds; government subsidies are \nthe main source of revenue for public health facilities and programs. Disadvantages of this \ncomplicated mix include high administration costs, weak information systems, cost-shifting (and \nconsequent penalties in terms of mistrust), and conflicting financial incentives for care providers \nand patients. Health insurance contributed less than 10% from 1991\u20132000, although it has been \nsteadily  growing  in  the  past  3  years,  driven  by  special  programs  of  national  and  local \ngovernment that have been targeting the poor. Almost half of the money spent on health came \nfrom direct out-of-pocket payments by individuals. This is of great concern because self-pay \ndecisions, especially of the poor, are often poorly informed, increase supplier-induced demand, \nand reduce the degree of progressivity of health care financing. \n \n5.  The Government decided to address these weaknesses in 1995 by establishing the \nNational Health Insurance Program under the management of a new government agency, the \nPhilippines Health Insurance Corporation or PhilHealth. This brought together several existing \nhealth  insurance  schemes  and  provided  a  vehicle  for  later  aggregation  of  financing \nmechanisms. Attempts to increase the proportion of health financing through this channel have \nbeen only partially successful and less so for the informal sector, which represents a huge part \nof the Philippine economy. Coverage of the poor has increased since 2000, but membership by \nother sections of the population has grown only marginally\u2014their participation is desirable to \noffset some of the costs associated with coverage of the poor. \n \n6.  DOH controls service quality through various health regulations. The 1963 Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act created the Food and Drug Administration, which ensures the safety and \npurity of foods, drugs, and cosmetics made available to the public. The Generic Act of 1988 \nmandated  the  establishment  of  the  Philippines  National  Drug  Policy  in  response  to  the \ninadequate provision of affordable quality drugs to the people. The 1965 Hospital Licensure Act \nrequires that all hospitals in the country be licensed by DOH. PhilHealth plays an important role \nin maintaining service quality through its accreditation mechanisms: only those health facilities \nmeeting PhilHealth accreditation criteria are reimbursed for health services provided to insured \npatients.  \n \n7.  Since  the  passage  of  the  Local  Government  Code  in  1991,  national  public  health \nprograms such as tuberculosis control, immunization and family planning are delivered by local \ngovernment units (LGUs) with national Government support in the form of medical supplies and \ntechnical assistance. Private health services providers, both nongovernment organizations and \nfor-profit private providers, have been progressively involved, in particular in the tuberculosis \nand family planning programs. \n \n2.  Health Status \n \n8.  The health status of Filipinos has improved in the last two decades. Infant mortality \ndeclined from 57 to 29 per 1000 live births between 1990 and 2003, and under-5 mortality from \n80 to 40. Maternal mortality fell from 209 to 172 per 100,000 live births between 1990 and 1998. \nHowever,  there  are  reasons  for concern.  First,  the  common  illnesses  of  poverty  (such  as \ninfectious diseases, and malnutrition) have not been reduced to acceptable levels, while social \nand  economic  changes  are  creating  new  costly  challenges  in  terms  of  lifestyle  diseases. \nSecond,  improvements  in  health  status  have  been  less  significant  than  in  many  similar \ncountries. Third, while avoidable mortality has declined, many non-fatal health problems have \nreceived less attention. For example, malnutrition in children under-5 only declined from 34.5% \nto 32% between 1990 and 1998. Fourth, the improvements have not been equally shared: for \n ", "    3\nexample, the national infant mortality rate is 29 per 1,000 live births, but it varies from 22 in \nManila to 61 in Eastern Visayas. \n \n9.  Filipinos  are  suffering  from  a  double  burden  of  illness  from  infectious  and  lifestyle \ndiseases, some of which are new to the country. The country has not successfully rid itself of \ninfectious diseases, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, gastroenteritis, malaria, and measles, \nwhich continue to be leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Acute respiratory infection still \nclaims the highest number of lives of children under-5 years of age. Tuberculosis remains a \nmajor public health threat: with 297 tuberculosis cases per 100,000. However, lifestyle diseases, \nsuch as cardiovascular diseases, malignancies, and pulmonary disorders (e.g., asthma and \nchronic  obstructive  lung  disorders),  are  moving  up  in  the  top  10  causes  of  mortality  and \nmorbidity.  A  growing  incidence  of  HIV/AIDS  (human  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency syndrome), and emerging diseases such as SARS (severe acute respiratory \nsyndrome) and avian flu also pose a potential threat to the country and require particular \nattention.  \n \n10.  Malnutrition and nutrition deficiencies, major factors influencing the health of mother and \nchildren remain public health issues. Iron deficiency anemia affects 29% of the population, with \nwomen constituting a majority of those afflicted. Among pregnant women, the prevalence of \nvitamin A deficiency increased from 16.4% in 1993 to 22.2% in 1998. Fertility continues to \ndecline gradually, but the Philippines\u2019 total fertility rate1 of 3.7 and population growth rate of \n2.4% are still considerably higher than the 1998 rates in neighboring Southeast Asian countries. \nWith a national contraceptive prevalence rate of only 45%, much lower than its neighbors, the \nPhilippines has a high unmet demand for effective family planning. With poor reproductive \nhealth, sexually transmitted diseases are not satisfactorily controlled. Many risk factors for the \nrapid spread of HIV/AIDS are present. \n \n  3.  Poverty and Health \n \n11.  The poor have less access to quality health care and consequently are in worse health \nthan the rich. The Philippines has one of the highest income disparity ratios in Asia, with the \nrichest population decile commanding more than 20 times the income of the lowest population \ndecile in 2003. Public health delivery systems have deteriorated in recent years and support for \npreventive health serving the rural and poor segments of the population has not kept up with the \nincreases in the number of people that must be served.  Poor people reported seeing a doctor \nonly 25% of the time when they were sick while the rich saw a doctor 48% of the time. Over \n90% of poor women deliver their children at home with traditional birth attendants, while the rich \ndeliver in hospitals where the risk is much lower. This is one of the factors contributing to the \nfact that the infant mortality rate among the poorest 20% of the population is more than double \nthat of the richest 20%. The under-5 mortality rate among the poor is nearly three times higher \nthan among the rich. The Philippines has the lowest use of contraceptives and the highest \nfertility rates and population growth rates in Asia (2.36% per year). The poor have much less \naccess to family planning methods than do the rich. The poor have 6.5 births per woman (1998) \nwhile the rich have only 2.1 births. Only 20% of the poor use contraceptives as opposed to 30% \nof the rich.  Malnutrition and maternal mortality are health issues linked to poverty and high \npopulation growth. In the Philippines, malnutrition has not declined significantly during the past \n20 years from 34% in 1990 to 32 % in 2001. Maternal mortality has declined less in the \nPhilippines  than  in  the  neighboring  countries  of  Southeast  Asia.    Access  to  quality  care, \nespecially for the rural poor, has been declining. This is due to overcrowding of higher level \n                                                 \n1  The total fertility rate gives an indication of the average number of births per women during her childbearing age. \n ", "4    \npublic hospitals, reduced health expenditures, and a shift of public resources away from the \nlocally-funded primary and secondary health centers and hospitals, including BHSs and RHUs \nin favor of larger centrally-funded health institutions and tertiary care facilities. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Overview \n \n12.   In contrast to the undeniable achievements in improving the health status of the rapidly \nincreasing  population  during  the  last  decades,  progress  in  recent  years  has  slowed.  The \nproportion of fully immunized children over the past 10 years has not reached the desired level \nof at least 80%. In 2001, only 62.9 % of children were fully immunized. Although deaths from \ndiarrhea  for  all  ages  declined  from  1980  to  1990,  its  rate  of  prevalence  among  children \nincreased sharply in 1998 to 1 out of 14 children under 5. Variations in life expectancy and \ninfant and maternal mortality are significant for different regions in the country. These variations \nreflect the inequitable sharing of health services among regions and among segments of the \npopulation within each region: there is inequity in geographical access to health facilities and \nhealth  providers,  but  also  in  the  quality  and  the  cost  of  available  health  services.  As  a \nconsequence, the overall performance of the Philippine health sector lags far behind those of its \nSoutheast Asian neighbors. \n \n13.  Despite  significant  external  assistance  (para.  29)  and  relatively  successful \nimplementation of narrowly focused programs, inequity and inefficiency remain the major issues \nof the Philippines health sector. The large variations in health status among social classes and \namong regions reflect unequal access to health services and, in particular, to quality health \nservices and affordable drugs. Quality health services and drugs are available, but too often \nonly in the private sector, are expensive and are concentrated in urban areas. Physical access \nis limited in non-urban areas and many people, in particular the poor, can only afford health \nservices  provided  by  public  facilities,  which  in  most  cases  are  not able  to  provide  quality \nservices because of resources constraints and inefficiencies in the delivery system. \n \n14.  Much inefficiency is due to the fact that the Philippines health system has not yet \nadapted to the conditions created by devolution under the Local Government Code (1991). The \ndevolution  of  health  services  from  the  national  government  to  the  LGUs  resulted  in \nfragmentation of the public health care delivery system, with provincial governments taking \nresponsibility  for  referral  hospitals,  and  municipal  and  city  governments  managing  primary \nhealth care facilities (RHUs and BHSs) and providing some public health services. At present, \nno formal referral and patient gate-keeping arrangement is in place for DOH-retained and LGU \nhospitals. Patients tend to by-pass lower level referral centers and proceed directly to higher-\nlevel facilities, often because of the lack of drugs and competent health personnel at lower \nfacilities. Drug procurement for public health facilities, no longer centralized, is also fragmented \namong LGUs, resulting in logistics problems, stock outages, and increased drug prices because \ndrugs are ordered in small quantities. Health personnel are also affected, as they no longer \nhave a clear career path to advance in the ranks of DOH and thus are more hesitant to practice \nin remote areas and among the poor. Moreover, a salary ceiling (50% of the local budget) \nimposed  by  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management  reduces  LGUs\u2019  capacity  to  hire \nadditional staff. Studies suggest a wide variance in health system status across LGUs. The \nLGUs that gave priority to health have significantly better systems and health outcomes while \nthose that did not suffered. \n \n ", "    5\n15.  The poor are mainly using public health services and public hospitals, because that is all \nthat is available in remote areas or because private providers are too expensive. Improving the \nquality of services provided by public hospitals and facilities is essential if the needs of the poor \nare to be addressed. However, besides severe under-funding of public hospitals, the present \nadministrative system provides few incentives for public hospitals to improve cost-efficiency. \nThis situation is aggravated by a significant lack of managerial and administrative skills in public \nhospitals. \n \n16.  Government  action  is  needed  to  coordinate  the  diverse  actors  in  the  sector  under \ndecentralization. In 1999, DOH developed the Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA), which \ndefines key reforms and strategies required to address inequity and inefficiency, and achieve \nthe millennium development goals (MDGs). The HSRA has the following goals: expand the \neffective coverage of public health programs; increase access and utilization, especially by the \npoor, of hospital services from both public and private health care providers; and reduce the \nfinancial burden on individual families in need of health care. To achieve these goals, several \nunderlying structural constraints need to be addressed by (i) increasing public resources and \nthe efficiency with which they are used, (ii) improving in the health insurance system, (iii) \nimproving  hospitals  and  local  government  health  systems,  and  (iv)  introducing  regulatory \nreforms. A description of the structural reform requirements in these areas follows. \n \n  2.  Structural Issues \n \n17.   At 3.5% of gross domestic product in 2001, health care spending in the Philippines is \nstill below the 5% benchmark set by the World Health Organization. The spending pattern raises \nconcern for the efficiency, equity, and adequacy of health care provision. The disproportionate \nspending  on  personal  health  care  (75.7%)  is  inefficient  because,  relative  to  public  health, \npersonal  health  care  is  less  cost-effective  and  benefits  much  fewer  people  per  peso  of \ninvestment.  Placing  the  largest  burden  of  payment  on  household  out-of-pocket  payments \n(42.8%) is both inefficient and inequitable considering that a large segment of the population is \npoor. \n \n18.  By law, the health insurance premium of the poorest (some 25% of the population) \nshould be paid by LGUs, but severe budget constraints prevent LGUs from fully covering their \npoor  populations.  The  national  Government  has  extended  an  earlier  decision  to  provide \nsubsidies to the poorest LGUs to help them cover the poor. However, several issues need to be \naddressed. First, national subsidies are only provided to LGUs that commit their own funds for \nthe insurance premium; many LGUs still need to be convinced to allocate enough resources to \ncover their poor. Second, another 25% of the population, mostly poor, are not covered by the \nlaw and cannot afford to pay the full cost of health care. Third, even those poor who are covered \nare not aware of the benefits and are not utilizing health services effectively. Finally, the benefit \npackages of PhilHealth need to be improved to better respond to the needs of the poor. Health \ninsurers are still studying how to establish adequate mechanisms for specifying the volumes \nand types of services; appropriate prices; and control of utilization, costs, and quality of care. \nPhilHealth has made some progress in the last 2 or 3 years but much remains to be done. For \nexample, the basis for payment for inpatient care is still mainly on the basis of days of stay, \nwhich  encourages  prolongation  of  the  period  of  hospitalization.  Fee  for  service  is  always \nproblematic to the extent that few patients are sufficiently well-informed to judge whether the \nservices are appropriate or reasonably priced. Given the particular relations between service \nproviders and patients in the health sector, there are many opportunities for supplier-induced \ndemand and unnecessary or otherwise inappropriate care. \n \n ", "6    \n19.  The Philippines is fortunate to have many skilled and dedicated health professionals who \ndo  a  good  job  in  the  circumstances.  However,  the  many  workforce  problems  include  low \nmotivation, poor working standards, lack of flexibility of roles and functions, and poor training in \nsome  clinical  areas.  The  uneven  distribution  of  clinical  staff  is  a  major  problem.  One \ndistributional aspect is the concentration of health professionals in urban areas, and acute \nshortages  in  some  of  the  more  remote  rural  areas.  Another  aspect  is  the  sometimes \ninappropriate mix of staff. The Government\u2019s target for barangay health workers is 1 per 20 \nhouseholds, but the actual ratio was 1 per 72 households in 2000.2 The doctor to population \nratio is also below the target (1 per 26,000 compared with the target of 1 per 20,000). There is a \nsimilar trend in the nurse to population ratio. The issue is to retain a portion of the overseas \ncontract  workers  who  are  well-trained  health  professionals.  Lifting  of  human  resource \nconstraints is critical for improving performance of the health system and deserves urgent \nattention. These constraints are linked to conditions of service, training, remuneration, and \nincentives; and will fundamentally determine capacities for sustained improvement in health \nservices. \n \n20.  In total, problems of efficiency and effectiveness are significant at all levels of health \ncare facilities, whether Government or private. One reason is that few incentives are provided to \nencourage care providers to be aware of, and comply with, best practice. Community-based \ncare is reasonably well regulated with regard to selected services (such as child immunizations), \nbut many health care providers are inadequately trained or motivated. At the other extreme, \nmany  highly  trained  medical  specialists  believe  they  have  the  right  to  autonomy  in  their \npractices,  and  may  resist  attempts  to  conduct  auditing  processes.  This  is  reflected  in  the \nrelatively high degree of clinical practice variation in both cost and method of care. Second, \nclinical teamwork is often unsatisfactory. This is reflected in poor communications between \nclinical professions\u2014and especially between doctors and nurses. It is also evident between \nhealth care settings. For example, communications and coordination are typically weak between \nhospitals, community health centers, and general practitioners. Third, consumers are seldom \nadequately involved in the health care process. This means they may be provided with care \nabout which they have been poorly informed, and that they do not feel empowered to provide \nfeedback on their health care service experiences in the interests of service improvement. \n \n21.  Clinical pathways and clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)3 have emerged as critical \ncomponents of well-run health systems in the last 20 years. Some use is made of CPGs in the \nPhilippines. For example, midwives in rural health units have simple pathways for common case \ntypes  that  are  based  on  national  designs.  A  few  of  the  more  innovative  hospitals  are \nprogressively introducing clinical pathways of their own volition, for reasons of quality control, \ncompetitive advantage, and reduction of risks of litigation. PhilHealth has mandated the use of \npathways for a small number of case types, including uncomplicated pregnancies, ambulatory \ntreatment of tuberculosis, and cataract removal. However, most health care remains uncovered \nby CPGs and clinical pathways. \n \n22.  Only 13% of total health expenditures are used for public health. Public health programs, \nsuch as family planning (as part of reproductive health), the program against tuberculosis, and \nhealthy life-style promotion, lack adequate financing despite their high benefit for the poor and \n                                                 \n2   Department of Health. 2000. Field Health Service Information System. Manila. \n3  A clinical pathway is a form used in the management of an individual patient\u2019s care (and there are different forms \nfor each case type). It guides the care team (thus increasing efficiency and quality of care), serves as an integrated \nhealth record of the care actually given by all types of clinicians, and informs patients of the care they may expect \nto receive. Clinical practice guidelines outline a more broad description of case specific treatments. Clinical \nprotocols is a more generic term for both, clinical pathways and clinical practice guidelines.  \n ", "    7\ntheir  significant  positive  externalities  for  society.  Moreover,  these  programs  suffer  from \ninefficient organization and incentives. Yearly budgetary allocations prevent adequate planning \nand, combined with lack of management skills at the local level, result in logistics problems and \nrupture of stock of supplies. National subsidies are allocated to the LGUs responsible for \nimplementing the program, but subsidies are allocated on a per capita basis without taking into \nconsideration  LGU  need  or  fiscal  capacity.  And  despite  progress  in  recent  years  (e.g.,  in \naddressing tuberculosis) tremendous opportunities still exist to better involve the private and \nnon-profit health sector, for example in the family planning and tuberculosis programs.  \n \n23.  Devolution has resulted in many improvements. For example, several LGUs (including \nthose in Capiz, Pangasinan, and Pasay City) have been remarkably successful in enrolling \nindigents in the national health insurance scheme. Some LGUs (and particularly in Capiz and \nPangasinan) have improved methods of drugs procurement and management in response to \ngaps in supply. Bukidnon LGU made some innovative changes in contracts for hospital staff to \novercome recruitment difficulties under the national payment rules. Other local initiatives have \nconcerned facilities and resource sharing between public and private health facilities in Makati \nCity, Negros Oriental, and South Cotabato; integration of several development activities (in \nNegros Oriental); improvements in continuity of governance (in South Cotabato); and improved \nreferral systems (through interlocal health zones [ILHZs]).  \n \n24.  Many problems have resulted from the failure to give adequate consideration to the \ncomplexities of devolution. One obvious initial problem was that of disagreement about the cost \nof services transferred to the LGUs in relation to the additional revenues allocated to the LGUs. \nAnother  issue  relates  to  the  fragmentation  of  referral  systems  and  the  coordination  and \nintegration of services. The longstanding problems of service coordination at the local level were \naccentuated by the devolution process. Although greater local autonomy created opportunities \nto integrate services within each LGU, it had several unintended adverse effects, including a \nweakening of coordination between LGUs. One corrective measure was to develop the concept \nof ILHZs, whereby LGUs could agree to collaborate to improve the quality, efficiency, and \neffectiveness  of  health  service  provision.  Details  of  the  design  were  specified  in  a  DOH \nadministrative order in 2001 (AO 37). The idea was partially tested in a few provinces and \nparticularly in South Cotabato in the Integrated Community Health Services Project (ICHSP),4 \nwhich was implemented from 1997 to 2003. But evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of \nthe specified design is lacking. \n \n25.  Many regulations are outdated, predating devolution. This has a particularly significant \nimpact for the procurement of drugs and development of an efficient public-private partnership \nin  the  health  sector.  With  devolution,  drugs  are  procured  locally,  resulting  often  in  more \nexpensive drugs and creating problems for quality control of drugs and medical supplies. Lack \nof  clear  regulations  for  coordination  with  the  private  health  sector  has  resulted  in  missed \nopportunities for better coordination and complementarity and sometimes led to a chaotic supply \nof hospital services (facilities and medical equipment) across provinces. \n \n26.  In summary, the structural issues, which require reforms, revolve around access of the \npoor to the insurance system, funding and quality of both hospitals and local health systems, \naccess to quality public health care, and provision of regulatory incentives and capacity for \nincreased  efficiency.  To  implement  these  reforms  effectively,  coordinated  interventions  are \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 1995.

Manila. \n ", "8    \nrequired across these areas in terms of investments, administrative reforms and perhaps most \nimportantly,  fostering  cultural  change  within  institutions.  ADB  has  been  involved  in  the \nPhilippines health sector for many years and in a number of fields focusing on the community, \nand women's health. This experience has reinforced the need for structural reform and provided \nthe basis for design of needed interventions. \n \n  3.  Lessons Learned \n \n27.  In the Philippines, several projects have piloted some of the proposed reforms of the \nGovernment's  HSRA.  ADB's  ICHSP  provided  very  important  lessons  for  the  HSRA.  The \nproblems and issues are not unique to the Philippines. A number of key lessons have been \nlearned both from developing and developed country experience (Appendix 3). While health \nsystems vary enormously, these lessons are nevertheless applicable across most systems. \nFirst, in developing countries any initially focus should be on the poor and basic health services, \nknowing that the poor are benefiting most from basic health care at the community level. \nSecond, the structure of health-care systems must be changed so that competitive pressures \npush them in a more useful direction, enhancing the power of purchasers and increasing \ncompetition in the supply of medical care. Another lesson is that just because governments \nfinance  so  much  of  health  care,  they  do  not  necessarily  have  to  deliver  it  themselves. \nGovernments should also review their role as regulators. A better role for regulators would be to \nsponsor competition. Regulators should set out quality standards and monitor performance, \nbuilding on some positive initiatives in other countries. The re-engineering of health care will \nrequire reform in the way medical providers are paid. Successful reform will involve rewarding \nquality and performance, and paying directly for better outcomes, and for steps that reduce \ncosts of care. \n \n28.  Experience in implementing the ICHSP and other Philippine health sector projects has \nshown that successful implementation of development-supported projects in a devolved context \nrequires a well-planned effort to build stakeholder partnerships. The ICHSP initially experienced \nconfrontations between the central Government agencies and the LGUs, and between LGUs \nthemselves. The challenge was to change confrontation into collaboration; this occurred as the \nstakeholders  saw  the  benefits  of  partnership.  The  ICHSP  eventually  became  an  effective \nvehicle to re-establish collegial partnership between DOH and the various levels of LGUs in \nplanning, managing, and financing health services within a devolved set-up. In a significant way, \nit helped to break barriers, bridge gaps, and bring about a new partnership in managing health \nservices in the country. Additional recurrent issues hampering effective project implementation \nin the Philippines include a prolonged approval process and time consuming procedures for \nprocurement of goods and civil works encountered at the central level. Implementation of the \nICHSP tested the initiative of empowering LGUs: bidding of civil works was entirely managed by \nLGUs, including opening of bids in the project provinces. This positive experience demonstrates \nthat contract award processing can be made significantly more effective and efficient. \n \n  4.  External Assistance \n \n29.  External  assistance  to  the  sector  has  been  extensive  but  has  not  had  significant \nstructural impact as it was mainly piloting and testing technical improvements under devolution. \nUnited States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided the initial support for the \nHSRA through the Health Sector Reform Technical Assistance Program. With the assistance of \nthe  World  Bank,  DOH  has  developed  comprehensive  reform  proposals  for  social  health \ninsurance, drug procurement and, as part of the Second Women\u2019s Health and Safe Motherhood \n ", "    9\nProject (WHSMP II), reproductive health-family planning. The World Bank also supports the \nEarly Childhood Development Project, jointly financed by ADB,5 and the Social Expenditure \nManagement Project 2, used for budgetary support in procuring vaccines, tuberculosis drugs \nand oral contraceptives. USAID provides technical assistance to the tuberculosis program, the \nInfectious Disease Surveillance and Control Project and the Integrated Family Planning and \nMaternal Health Program. The family planning program has also been supported by Deutsche \nGesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbei (German Agency for Technical Cooperation, GTZ) \nand  USAID.  GTZ  has  tested  community  participation  mechanisms  in  local  financing  and \nsupports reproductive health and family planning. Japan International Cooperation Agency is \ninvolved in tuberculosis control, the Philippine Pharmacopeia project, measles elimination, and \ncommunity  health.  Other  partners  include  the  United  Nations  agencies  (Wolrd  Health \nOrganization, United Nations Children's Fund [UNICEF], United Nations Population Fund, and \nUnited Nations Development Programme), Australian Agency for International Development, \nand the Austrian, Spanish, and Belgian cooperation. ADB has been a long time partner of DOH \nwith its cofinancing of the Women's Health and Safe Motherhood Project6 and the Integrated \nCommunity  Health  Services  Project7  cofinanced  by  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. ADB partnered with DOH in other projects: Early Childhood Development Project \nand the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project. Details are provided in Appendix 4. \n \n  5.  Opportunities \n \n30.  As a consequence of the technical focus of much assistance, many of the strategic \nobjectives of the HSRA still to be operationalized. Only some reforms have thus been tested \nwith the assistance of DOH\u2019s development partners and lessons learned. The Government has \nauthorized  collection  of  user  fees  and  retention  of  revenue  in  DOH  hospitals,  and  some \nprovinces  have  successfully  tested  financial  and  managerial  autonomy  in  their  provincial \nhospitals. The enrollment of some indigents in PhilHealth by the LGUs has taken place in most \nconvergence sites.8 Pooled procurement of drugs in a few provinces has significantly reduced \nprices. In several LGUs, public and private hospitals have forged agreements to share high-tech \nmedical equipment, or to use a private hospital as a referral hospital for the area. Some LGUs \nhave provided tax incentives to the private sector to facilitate services to the poor by private \nhospitals. In several parts of the country, LGUs have initiated the establishment of ILHZs \ninvolving  all  health  services  providers  in  the  area.  Involvement  of  the  community  and  the \ndevelopment  of  a  functional  community-based  referral  system  have  been  successfully \nintroduced in several ILHZs. One ILHZ in Negros Oriental registered with the Security Exchange \nCommission,  facilitating  independent  management  with  for  example  independent  hiring  of \nadditional health personnel with increased salaries. These experiments have provided important \ninsights for DOH and LGUs. \n \n31.  DOH has asked all its development partners to support the HSRA. The ADB health \nsector policy,9 with its emphasis on access for all to essential health services that are effective, \ncost-efficient and affordable, fully supports the HSRA's objectives. In view of this, ADB has \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1998.

Policy for the Health Sector. Manila. \n ", "10    \nproposed the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP) taking into account the lessons \nlearned. The key principles utilized are: \n \n  (i)  shift public spending to the poor and vulnerable; \n  (ii)  decrease costs by encouraging competition among providers, increasing use of \nefficient clinical protocols, and focusing at basic levels of care; and \n  (iii)  increase quality of human resources in clinical areas, facility management, and \npolicy.  \nInitially, the interventions supported by the HSDP will be budget neutral and after the Philippines \nrecovers from its current fiscal constraints, expenditures will rise to international norms. The \nprogram loan will provide support for defraying the adjustment costs of regulatory changes, and \nthe investment loan will assist the Government to implement the changes. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n \n32.  The overall goal of the HSDP is to improve the health status of the population, especially \nof the poor, and achieve health-related MDG targets. The purpose of the HSDP is to increase \nutilization of affordable and financially sustainable quality health services by the poor based on \nthe progressive implementation of cost-saving and output-enhancing health sector reforms that \nare guided by the HSRA. The focus is on results, emphasizing improved access to health \nservices and better outcomes for the poor, and including greater access to essential drugs, \nstrengthened health systems and better management. The HSDP consists of a program loan to \nsupport national health sector reforms and an investment loan to finance specific interventions. \nThe  program  loan  will  catalyze  the  implementation  of  health  sector  reforms  by  creating a \nsupportive policy environment for substantial changes in sector operations and for investments \nat the national and local levels. The project loan will advocate, design, initiate, and evaluate \nspecific interventions in support of the HSRA at the national level and in five selected provinces \nwith the objective to translate agreed policy reform into changes in corporate cultures and in \nconcrete improvements of health services, especially for the poor. The program framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Important Features \n \n33.  ADB has been at the core of policy dialogue in the sector over a number of years. The \nkey policy reforms targeted under this Program have been discussed at donor forums and, \ntogether with DOH, the key agenda items have been developed. As other development partners \nmay become involved in implementing HSRA in other provinces, it is also essential that DOH be \nable to coordinate efficiently all external assistance for HSRA and institutionalization of this \ncoordination is required. This refers particularly to grant funds that may become available from \nbilateral donors and the European Union.10 The HSDP will address the root causes of the lack \nof substantial changes since the publication of the HSRA in 1999 by putting into place the \nappropriate incentives for change in systems, processes, and rewards. The HSDP takes into \naccount the lack of fiscal resources available to the Government to invest in health and poverty \nreduction; and proposes a refocus of health spending and higher expenditures in areas that \ndirectly benefit the poor. The HSDP follows a strategy that invests in people and primary health \nfacilities, and focuses on cost containment and cost efficiency. The envisaged policy actions \n                                                 \n10 The European Union has earmarked EURO32 million in support of implementing HSRA and has expressed its \nintention to cofinance the Program. \n ", "    11\nand  reform  interventions  emphasize  performance-based  resource  allocation,  increased \naccountability and good governance, and consumer participation. The structure of the program \nloan, based on the five pillars of the HSRA, enables these strategies, and the lessons learned \n(paras. 27 and 28), to be integrated with ongoing and future investments in the sector (Appendix \n4). The Program aims at system-wide changes of organizational and professional cultures, \nmethods of health care financing, resource allocation and health care regulation. \n \n34.  The Program reforms will be supported by the project loan, which will implement all \nproposed  policy  changes  in  selected  pilot  LGUs  (convergence  sites).  Convergence  sites \ncomprise clusters of LGUs in the provinces of Ifugao, Ilocos North, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental \nMindoro, and Romblon. In order to learn a maximum of lessons for national replication, the \nProject area includes provinces with high and low fiscal capacity. HSDP however was designed \nas a poverty intervention, and in all provinces, the focus will be on the needs of the poor and \nmarginalized  groups  with  special  attention  to  indigenous  people.  The  Project  loan  is  also \nstructured by the five pillars of HSRA. The two loans of the Program are the first external \nassistance  supporting  a  systematic  and  comprehensive  implementation  of  the  reforms  at \nnational level and in selected convergence sites. DOH intends to implement HSRA in ten more \nprovinces during the coming years. Close collaboration among development partners under \nDOH\u2019s leadership has been going on during the last years and will form the basis for analyzing \nlessons learned before additional external assistance will help to extend the implementation of \nthe HSRA to other provinces.  \n \nC.  The Program Loan \n \n1.  Objective  \n \n35.  The program loan supports the overall goal of the HSDP by promoting cost-effectiveness \nof health services and equity of health status through implementation of an integrated set of \nhealth sector reforms. The system-wide changes will largely concern improving the ways that \nHSRA reforms are implemented and managed at all levels in the health sector. The program  \nloan support three fundamental objectives: (i) improve the focus on the poor and primary health \ncare, (ii) support structural reform of sector organizations, and (iii) operationalize regulatory \nreform and improve governance in the sector.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \n36.  The policy matrix and the development policy letter in appendix 5 and 6 describe the \nreforms considered important and necessary to achieve the HSRA objectives and specific \nsector investments. The reforms are grouped into the five HSRA reform areas: (i) social health \ninsurance, (ii) hospital autonomy, (iii) public health programs, (iv) ILHZs, and (v) regulatory \nfunctions. The program loan will also support reform in health sector governance, although the \nmain thrust of activities in this area will be undertaken through the project loan. \n \n    a.  Health Care Finance Reform \n \n37.  Social health insurance reforms aim at expanding PhilHealth coverage to at least 85% of \nthe  population,  with  universal  coverage  of  the  poor.  The  objectives  of  the  reforms  are  to \nincrease membership and improve benefit packages. To increase coverage of the poor, national \nsubsidies that complement local governments\u2019 partial payment of the health insurance premium \nfor the poor will continue, and the Department of Budget Management will establish appropriate \nmechanisms to ensure that national funds are timely remitted to PhilHealth. The establishment \n ", "12    \nby PhilHealth of progressive premium contributions based on one\u2019s capacity to pay will improve \nfairness and facilitate increased coverage of the informal sector. PhilHealth will pilot a low health \ninsurance premium for the poor and vulnerable, who cannot benefit by law from government \nsubsidies  (about  25%  of  the  population).  PhilHealth  will  multiply  enrollment  and  payment \ncenters and authorize group enrollment through cooperatives, unions, and other community \ngroups.  The  benefit  package  will  be  improved,  with  better  coverage  of  hospital  services, \ncatastrophic and expensive illnesses, and outpatient services. Treatment and prevention of \ndiseases that still represent a public health threat (tuberculosis, rabies, and vaccine-preventable \ninfections), and family planning will progressively be covered. To increase utilization of services, \nPhilHealth will develop and implement an information campaign, especially targeting the poor. \n \n    b.  Hospital Reforms \n \n38.   The reforms will enhance the sustainability and efficiency of hospitals by restructuring \nthem into corporations and supporting participation of the private and nonprofit sector. They will \nalso encourage the upgrading of lower tier hospitals to provide better quality care, relieving the \nstress  on  regional  hospitals.  Hospital  reforms  will  ensure  that  quality  health  services  are \nprovided cost-efficiently, linking hospital revenue to quality of services. Financially autonomous \npublic hospitals are expected to become less dependent on direct budget subsidies from DOH. \nA first step is to secure authority for public hospitals to earn, retain and utilize all their revenues. \nThe two main sources of revenues will be: users\u2019 fees and reimbursement of hospital services \nby PhilHealth.11 Hospital autonomy, however, will require building management capacity of \nhospital administrators and developing good corporate governance through various guidelines, \nregulations and accountability mechanisms. Various management tools such as business plans, \ncontinuing quality improvement programs and use of clinical protocols will be introduced. While \nsubsidies will still be required, they will become performance-based rather than facility-based. \n \n    c.  Public Health Reforms \n \n39.  The objective of these reforms is to increase financial resources for, and effectiveness \nof, primary health care. Public health programs such as immunization, the tuberculosis program \nand  the  reproductive  health  and  family  planning  program  are  cost-effective  approaches  to \nimprove the health of the Filipinos and achieve the MDGs. With devolution, DOH continues to \nplan, monitor and finance these programs, but LGUs are responsible for delivering the services. \nReforms will secure continuous financing of the Program through multi-year, performance-\nbased budgets. To improve equity and efficiency, DOH subsidies to the LGUs to implement the \nprograms will no longer be allocated on a population-based formula, but rather based on the \nLGUs\u2019 fiscal capacity and poverty prevalence. The reforms will be tested by focusing first on the \nprogram against tuberculosis and the family planning program, both high priority programs for \nthe Government. \n \n    d.  Local Health System Reform \n \n40.   The fragmentation of the local health systems, an unforeseen result of devolution, \nneeds  to  be  addressed.  ILHZs  will  be  established\u2014and  ultimately  legally  registered  as \nautonomous entities\u2014by convincing neighboring LGUs in specific catchment areas to cooperate \n                                                 \n11  PhilHealth only reimburses hospitals, public or private, that are accredited. Lack of investment (rehabilitation and \nmedical equipment) in many public hospitals sometimes prevents accreditation and most often reduces the quality \nof services they can offer. The investment loan will provide the needed resources for hospitals in the five selected \nproject provinces. \n ", "    13\nand share functional facilities and services in a local health network involving the private health \nproviders. To increase efficiency and as an incentive for the LGUs to collaborate, PhilHealth will \ndevelop accreditation criteria and mechanisms that specifically apply to ILHZs. \n \n    e.  Regulatory Reform \n \n41.   Health-related  regulations  will  be  updated  to  answer  new  requirements  related  to \ndevolution. Focusing on the need to guarantee quality of services, regulatory reforms will first \nstreamline licensing and accreditation procedures for health facilities, strengthening in particular \nprimary  health  care  services  and  ensuring  an  equitable  and  cost-effective  distribution  of \nhospitals and high-technology medical devices across the country. High priority is also given to \ndeveloping regulations and incentives that will ensure availability of quality drugs at a cheaper \nprice. Another priority, highlighted by the recent SARS and avian flu outbreaks in Southeast, \nand Eastern Asia, is the need to strengthen the national disease surveillance system. \n \n3.  Financing Plan \n \n42.  The proposed loan size is based on the estimated direct short- to medium-term costs of \nthe reform program net of $280 million. In addition, associated restructuring costs resulting from \nHSRA implementation are substantial and include the following (Appendix 7): (i) according to \nthe  law,  national  Government  and  LGUs  share  the  costs  for  subsidizing  the  payment  of \nPhilHealth  premiums  of  the  poor.  With  the  HSRA  and  in  accordance  with  the  law,  the \nGovernment is aiming at universal coverage from the current estimated 50% coverage; (ii) the \ncost  of  nationwide  social  marketing  and  information  campaigns  addressing  all  relevant \nstakeholders,  including  DOH  personnel  at  central  and  regional  level,  local  authorities, \nprofessional organizations, and the population at large are significant; and (iii) additional efforts \nof testing, monitoring, and evaluating reform interventions by DOH and LGUs will require strong \ninputs  in  terms  of  staff  years  and  operational  costs.  The  Government  estimates  that \nimplementation of the reforms may eventually cost more than $2.2 billion. \n \n43.  The Government has requested a loan of $200,000,000 equivalent from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the HSDP and cover adjustment costs. The loan will have a \n15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof  0.75%  per  annum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  Loan \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own ondependent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The loan, expected to be utilized over 16 months, from \n1 January 2005 to 30 June 2007, will be released in two tranches. The first tranche of $100 \nmillion will be made available upon meeting the conditions of the first tranche and upon loan \neffectiveness. The second tranche of $100 million is expected to be released in mid-2006 or \nabout 15 months after first tranche release. Prior to the release of the second tranche, the \nGovernment will be required to meet the agreed upon conditions described in the policy matrix \nsummarized in Appendix 5 to demonstrate satisfactory progress with program implementation. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n44.  DOF will be the Executing Agency for the program loan. DOH and its agencies as well \nas other concerned departments will be responsible for implementing the reforms described in \nthe policy matrix and reporting implementation progress to ADB. The loan proceeds will be used \n ", "14    \nby the Government for the coverage of the poor by PhilHealth; to implement nation-wide social \nmarketing and information campaigns; and to cover the additional costs of testing, monitoring, \nand evaluating reform interventions by DOH and LGUs. \n \n45.  The  Government  and  ADB  will  review  program  implementation;  and  assess  the \nimplementation and impact of the policy, legal, and institutional reforms, and other changes \nenvisaged under the HSDP. To facilitate such a review the Government, through DOH, will \nprovide relevant data and information in a quarterly report. DOH will submit to ADB a detailed \nreport on the progress and impact of policy reforms during the first year of the HSDP within 3 \nmonths after the end of the first year of implementation. The measures specified as conditions \nfor the release of the second tranche of the loan are set out in the program policy matrix \n(Appendix 5). \n \n  5.  Procurement \n \n46.  The policy loan proceeds will be used to finance the equivalent foreign exchange costs \nof items produced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding listed ineligible items and \nimports financed under other official development assistance. The Government will certify that \n(i) if the loan proceeds will finance imports already made, the value of eligible imports in the \nperiod concerned exceeds the amount of the requested withdrawal, or (ii) if the loan proceeds \nwill finance items to be imported, the value of eligible imports in the immediately preceding 1-\nyear period is equal to or greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal plus all other \namounts expected to be withdrawn during the succeeding 1-year period. Appendix 8 provides \nthe list of ineligible items. \n \n  6.  Monitoring and Tranching \n \n47.  Throughout implementation, the steering committee and the UPMD will monitor quarterly \nthe  implementation  of  policy  and  institutional  reforms  envisaged  under  the  HSDP.  In \ncooperation  with  the  UMPD,  ADB  will  carry  out  semiannual  review  missions  to  assess \nimplementation of the policy agenda and discuss major policy developments with the concerned \nagencies. Such missions will be fielded to assess whether conditions for the release of the \nsecond  loan  tranche  have  been  fulfilled.  The  first  tranche  will  be  released  upon  loan \neffectiveness, expected in December 2004. The second tranche is expected to be released by \nJune 2006 (or about 18 months after the first tranche). To obtain the release of the second loan \ntranche, the Government will be required to carry out actions identified in the policy matrix as \nconditions for tranche release, and to demonstrate satisfactory progress in implementing the \nproject loan. \n \n7.  Counterpart Funds \n \n48.  The Government will use the local currency funds generated by the HSDP loan to meet \nprogram expenditures and associated costs of reform and to help maintain current levels of \nsocial expenditures. \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n \n1.  Objectives and Scope \n \n49.  Based on the goal of the HSDP, the Health Sector Development Project aims to make \nsignificant improvements in the health status of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable groups of the \n ", "    15\npopulation in selected provinces by increasing their access to, and utilization of, quality health \nservices. The Project will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of delivery of health care to \nthe poor by focusing on the investments and HSRA reforms needed to implement a number of \nCPGs critical to the health of the poor. Interventions will support the implementation of these \nCPGs in selected convergence sites, and in DOH, PhilHealth and other agencies at the central \nand regional levels. Project loan implementation will be progressive and performance-based, \nresponding to identifiable outputs and achievements of the convergence sites, to demonstrate \nthe effectiveness and the cost-efficiency of the HSRA in the selected provinces and thus provide \nthe foundation for expanding the HSRA package into other provinces. \n \n50.  The Project is designed as a sector project and is expected to cover five provinces. \nCurrently,  five  provinces  have  been  surveyed  and  are  eligible  for  project  support:  three \nneighboring provinces in the north of Luzon  (Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, and Nueva Vizcaya); and two \npoor  island  provinces  (Oriental  Mindoro  and  Romblon)  although  other  provinces  may \nparticipate. These provinces are convergence sites identified by DOH as having a strong LGU \ncommitment to health reforms including a willingness to borrow and to provide counterpart \nfunds. This will be confirmed by contracts between DOH and the LGUs before the start of \nproject activities in the concerned provinces. These provinces are relatively easy to access from \nManila, a major advantage for project administration as learned from previous ADB supported \nprojects. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n \n51.  The Project consists of five components implemented through two funding streams. \nDOH will finance consultancy and sector capacity building activity and investments to support \nHSRA  implementation.  The  special  purpose  entity  nominated  as  the  Municipal  Finance \nCorporation (MFC) will provide finance to LGUs to undertake required civil works and equipment \npurchase. The integration of activity and outputs across the five components is set out below.    \n \n    a.  Health Sector Governance \n \n52.  This  component  will  strengthen  participating  provinces  and  LGUs  to  implement  the \nHSRA.  Focusing  on  the  promotion  of  a  cross-disciplinary  culture  promoting  efficient  and \neffective care, it will enhance appropriate administrative and clinical skills, encourage adoption \nof improved clinical protocols (CPGs and clinical pathways), facilitate participation in health \nmanagement and planning, and strengthen monitoring systems that allow effective oversight. To \nstrengthen DOH, capacity building at all levels will be supported by a master plan, specific staff \ndevelopment activities, fellowships and information campaigns. Crucial expertise in areas like \nhealth financing and economics, management, sociology and anthropology, and marketing will \nbe needed at national, provincial, and municipal health offices. The Project will help DOH design \nand develop a national resource center. The center will be established (i) to provide policy \nanalysis and advice, (ii) to spearhead operations research, and (iii) as a repository of HSRA \nresource  materials.  The  center  will  systematically  document  lessons  learned  from  HSRA \nimplementation in the provinces, as well as compile and disseminate health-related information \nbased on a revamped health information system. Consumer satisfaction surveys, reflecting the \nperceived quality of services, will be initiated and the results published to support informed \nchoice and foster competition. Support for more effective public-private partnerships will include \nhospital area planning and improved implementation of CPGs including public health programs, \nin particular the program against tuberculosis and the reproductive health program including \nfamily planning. This component will provide the resources to design the systems for extension \nof PhilHealth coverage to lower income groups, implemented through the following components. \n ", "16    \nOther activities under this component are more logically discussed in relation to the components \nthey support and are set out in the following sections. \n \n    b.  Regulatory Reforms \n \n53.  This component will provide systems to DOH and LGUs to bolster cost-efficiency in the \nhealth sector. DOH will institute systems to help provinces and LGUs increase efficiency and \nreduce the cost of essential drug purchases, promoting the use of generic drugs. The devolution \nof some functions of the Bureau of Food and Drugs, such as monitoring and rapid preliminary \ntesting of drug quality, will be piloted in the project area. DOH will help LGUs and ILHZs to \nestablish  already  successfully  tested  mechanisms  for  the  procurement  and  distribution  of \npharmaceuticals,  such  as  outsourcing  the  procurement  of  drugs  and  pooled  procurement. \nActivities under the health sector governance component will design and test approaches like \nsocial franchising in the pharmaceutical sector, currently tested in more than 10 provinces, \nwhich is regarded as appropriate for procurement and distribution of low-cost quality medicines \nto remote areas and supporting involvement of the private health sector. Also under the health \nsector  governance  component,  DOH  will  carefully  monitor  LGUs  and  ILHZs  to  ensure \nsatisfactory performance before continuing and extending the new policies.  \n \n54.  To support these initiatives, performance will become the basis for resource allocation \nthrough  the  PhilHealth  insurance  system.  Designed  under  the  health  sector  governance \ncomponent, other cost-containment measures such as the introduction of competition into the \nprovision of services, guidelines on the procurement of high-tech medical equipment, and the \nprovision of expensive health services, will also be implemented to avoid oversupply and cost- \ninefficiencies. The Project will provide systems to PhilHealth so it may adopt a fee schedule for \nreimbursement of services and pharmaceuticals, which contains appropriate incentives to make \nhealth care service provision more accessible, competitive, and equitable both in public and in \nprivate facilities. \n \n    c.  Local Health Sector Reform \n \n55.  The third component will invest in improved health care systems and facilities at the LGU \nlevel,  enhancing  their  sustainability  and  effectiveness.  Project  resources  will  be  used  to \nimplement an agreed package of CPG-focused interventions in a sequenced manner, based on \na business plan and the actual performance of the concerned LGUs. The Project will support \nthe development of systems to administer ILHZs, establishing an efficient and effective referral \nnetwork of health facilities linking primary health care services with hospital services and public \nhealth programs. In return for project assistance, the LGUs will have to first ensure the coverage \nof  the  local  poor  under  PhilHealth.  Enrollment  of  people  in  the  non-formal  sector  will  be \nencouraged using a range of locally appropriate incentives, including group enrollment through \norganized groups. The existing means test will be reviewed to improve targeting of government \nsubsidies.  When  LGUs  meet  the  coverage  conditions,  project  funds  will  be  released  to \nrehabilitate  local  primary  and  secondary  health  care  facilities  to  conform  to  licensing  and \naccreditation requirements. The availability of affordable quality drugs is a major problem in the \nhealth sector, and the Project will integrate mechanisms for the procurement and management \nof drugs (logistics management, inventory control, and rational use of drugs) established under \nthe health sector governance and regulatory reform components in every ILHZ. In agreement \nwith the concerned LGUs, the Project has undertaken 13 case studies of ILHZ implementation \nin Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, and Romblon. ILHZ will involve both \npublic and private health sector providers.  \n \n ", "    17\n56.  As the Project concentrates on the needs of the poor, marginalized and vulnerable, \nspecific project activities will focus on building their capacity to help themselves, facilitate their \nrepresentation in local health boards, and increase their utilization of health services taking \nadvantage of PhilHealth coverage. Information campaigns specifically designed for the poor and \nmarginalized groups will be implemented, explaining PhilHealth benefits besides the traditional \nhealth information campaigns related to disease prevention and promotion of healthy life-style. \nThrough ILHZ outreach activities, community financing to cover health costs not reimbursed by \nPhilHealth (transport to hospital, outpatient drugs, etc), and group activities in support of health-\nrelated activities such as water supply, sanitation, and nutrition-related improvements will be \nencouraged.  The  health  sector  governance  component  will  establish  a  community-focused \ndatabase, building on the Department of Interior Local Government initiative started in 2002, to \nimprove identification of poor and vulnerable groups. \n \n  d.   Hospital Reform \n \n57.  The objective of this component is to enhance sustainability and efficiency of hospitals \nby restructuring them into corporations and support participation of the private and nonprofit \nsector integrated into CPGs. ILHZ and coordination mechanisms have been developed, and \nhospital  financial  autonomy  and  capacity  building  activities  will  be  undertaken  through  the \ngovernance reform component. Project funds will be used to rehabilitate local public hospitals, \nwith  the  objectives  to  (i)  provide  better  quality  services,  particularly  for  the  poor,  and  (ii) \nstimulate healthy competition between public and private health sector providers based on the \nquality of services offered. Civil works will mainly consist of rehabilitating and upgrading existing \nhealth facilities. In some cases, hospitals will be expanded and some primary health care \nfacilities  will  be  built  in  poorly  served  remote  areas  (particularly  in  areas  with  indigenous \npeople). An initial environmental examination was performed for the civil works to be financed \nby the HSDP (Appendix 9). The Project will also finance the procurement of medical and office \nequipment, and vehicles. Recurrent costs generated by these investments in the local health \nsystem will be compensated by efficiency gains and resulting cost savings. The governance \ncomponent  will  assist PhilHealth  to  design  benefit  packages  and  systems  to  reinforce  the \nobjectives of hospital reform. \n \n    e.  Public Health Reform \n \n58.  This component will provide cost-efficient systems for effective public health programs \nintegrated into CPGs. The Project will support in particular the implementation of the program \nagainst tuberculosis and the reproductive health. Program implementation and subsidies will be \nlinked  to  performance  in  the  ILHZs  and  project  LGUs.  For  tuberculosis,  the  Project  will \nstrengthen the World Health Organization-recommended DOTS.12 For reproductive health and \nfamily planning, the Project will support the implementation of a core package of services \ndeveloped by DOH under the Second Women\u2019s Health and Safe Motherhood Project. The \ngovernance component of the Project will provide systems design and support for effective \noperation of public health systems at LGU and provincial levels, and for related PhilHealth \nsystems. \n \n                                                 \n12  Directly Observed Therapy Strategy (DOTS) is the most effective strategy available today for controlling the \ntuberculosis epidemic. DOTS combines five elements: political commitment, microscopy services, drug supplies, \nsurveillance and monitoring systems, and use of highly efficacious regimes with direct observation of treatment. \n ", "18    \n3.  Project Cost Estimates \n \n59.  The  project  costs  amount  to  $23.3  million,  with  $14.1  million  accruing  to  national \norganizations and $3.6 million for LGUs. The remaining $1.3 million covers contingencies, \ninterest, and other charges. Of the total, $6.3 million (27%) is the foreign exchange cost and \n$17.1  million  equivalent  (73%)  represents  the  local  currency  costs.

Financing Plan \n \n60.  The Government has requested a loan of $13,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance 56% of the Project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a \ngrace period of 6 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, and a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) \nthe reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of \nthese terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communiction or advice from ADB. ADB will fund \n100% of the foreign exchange cost, totaling 28% of the estimated project cost, and 40% of the \nlocal currency cost. The Government will provide the remaining $10.3 million equivalent as \ncounterpart financing, which accounts for 44% of the total costs. This includes financing civil \nworks, in-country training, workshops, materials and consumables, project management, and \ntaxes and duties. DOH will finance consulting and sector capacity-building actitvity. The loan \nproceeds will be utilized over 6 years fro the date of loan effectiveness. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 2. \n \n ", "    19\nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local   Total  Percent \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nADB   6.25  6.75  13.00  56 \nGovernment  0.00  10.33  10.33  44 \nDepartment of Health    8.88  8.88   \nLocal government units    1.45  1.45   \n  Total   6.25  17.08  23.33  100 \n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n61.  $7.77 million of the loan proceeds will be lent to LGUs at market rates in accordance \nwith the Local Government Code and based on LGUs\u2019 fiscal capacity. Participating LGUs will \nshare the costs of the Project in terms of counterpart funds for civil works and equipment. The \nnominated special purpose entity, the Municipal Finance Corporation (MFC) will provide the \nloan financing to LGUs from the loan proceeds to undertake required civil works and equipment \npurchases, MFC, a wholly Government-owned development finance institution, was established \nas the Municipal Development Finance Office of DOF in 1984, and has gained relevant capacity \nofr LGU financing by implementing a wide variety of World Bank and ADB projects. In 2004, the \nGovernment  corporatized  the  organization  creating  MFC.  It  is  scheduled  to  commence \ncorporate  operations  in  February  2005.  Its  mission  is  to  provide  medium-  and  long-term \nfinancing to Philippine LGUs. It is capitalized at P1 billion. The funds flow for the Project is set \nout in Appendix 11. \n \n5.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n62.  DOH will be the Executing Agency for the Project and provide overall guidance for \nproject  implementation.  The  DOH\u2019s  undersecretary  for  external  affairs  will  be  the  project \ndirector. The director of the Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau will be the overall \nproject  technical  coordinator.  The  Bureau  of  International  Health  Cooperation  through  the \nUnified Project Management Division (UPMD) will be responsible for the overall management of \nthe Project. The head of UPMD will be the overall project manager. A team of consultants will \nbe recruited to assist UPMD as the unified project management unit (UPMU), which will be \ndirectly responsible for project implementation. MFC will establish a project management unit to \nundertake assessment and maintenance of loans to LGUs. This unit will be supported by UPMU \nconsultants. The secretary of DOH will lead a steering committee providing overall guidance to \nthe Project. Members will include DOF, MFC, PhilHealth, representatives of the private sector \n(nongovernment organizations, professional associations, private health care providers), and \nconsumer groups. The director of the Center for Health Development or DOH\u2019s regional health \noffice will be the regional project supervisor and will designate the existing regional unified \nproject management team as the regional supervisory unit for the Project. The regional unified \nproject management team will (i) ensure coordination between UPMD at the national level and \nthe project province(s) in their jurisdiction; (ii) provide technical support when appropriate, and \n(iii) be responsible for monitoring, evaluation and auditing of project activities.  \n \n63.  In the project provinces, the provincial governor will be the project director and the \nprovincial health officer the project coordinator. The provincial steering committee will comprise \nthe governor, project director, and chairs of the ILHZ boards. The provincial project coordinator \nwill assign one of his or her permanent staff as provincial project manager assisted by a team of \nconsultants and technical health experts, who will form the provincial PMU, which will be directly \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  project  activities  in  the  province.  The  provincial  project \n ", "20    \ndirector will facilitate establishment of an ILHZ.  Each ILHZ will have a board and permanent \nsecretariat. The HSDP will be implemented over 6 years. Every year, each ILHZ will prepare an \noperational plan (comprising a plan of action, a program of activities, and a financial plan) that \nwill be submitted to the national UPMD for approval via the provincial project coordinator, with a \ncopy to the Health Policy Development and Planning Bureau via the regional health office. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 12. \n \n  6.  Procurement \n \n64.  The  procurement  of  goods  and  services  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement and following existing standard operating procedures established by \nUPMD.  ADB  and  Government  procedures  and  rules  in  calling  for  tenders,  whether  for \ninternational  or  local  competitive  bidding,  will  be  followed.  The  existing  bids  and  awards \ncommittee of DOH will handle bid evaluation and contract awards. Civil works will be awarded \nby the LGUs on the basis of local competitive bidding. Procurement for most of the project \ngoods will be consolidated at the national UPMD level, with a limited number of procurements \ntaking place at the regional or provincial levels. Equipment (medical and non-medical), vehicles, \nand supplies will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding for contracts over \n$500,000, international shopping and local competitive bidding  for contracts between $100,000 \nand $500,000, or direct purchase. Civil works will be partially funded and contracted by the local \ngovernments.  For civil works, contracts of over $2 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding; all other contracts will use local competitive bidding. Philippines experience \nhas  shown  that  local  companies  alone  will  bid  below  these  thresholds,  local  capacity  is \nadequate,  domestic  procurement  processes  are  satisfactory,  and  the  Government  has \nrequested local competitive bidding be used where appropriate. For certain types of specialized \nmedical equipment, international shopping may be appropriate as the number of suppliers in the \nfield is limited. Indicative procurement packages are set out in Appendix 13. \n \n7.   Consulting Services \n \n65.  DOH will recruit a team of management consultants consisting of experts in financing, \nprocurement, civil works, monitoring and evaluation, and good governance and a technical team \nto provide advisory assistance to the Project. The technical advisory group of consultants will \ninclude experts in relevant health sector reform areas. Total input is estimated at 523 person-\nmonths of international and domestic consulting, comprising 86 person-months for international \nspecialists and 437 person-months for domestic specialists. The total cost of such services will \nbe $7.25 million with staff comprising $2.44 million and the remainder comprising training in \nhealth care reform and clinical and managerial training for staff of DOH, the participating LGUs, \nand the health facilities involved. The consultants will be engaged through an international \nconsulting firm following the quality and cost-based selection or through individual consultant \nselection in accordance with ADB Guidelines on Consultant Selection or other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants (outline terms of reference are \nin Appendix 14). \n \n  8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n66.  To expedite disbursement for project expenditures, the Government will establish two \nimprest accounts for eligible expenditures with the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, one each for \nDOH  and  MFC.  The  imprest  accounts  will  be  managed,  liquidated,  and  replenished  in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines on Imprest Fund and Statement of Expenditures Procedures. \nThe initial amount to be advanced under the imprest account will be the maximum of the \n ", "    21\nequivalent of $1 million for MFC and $500,000 for DOH. ADB's statement of expenditures \nprocedure may be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures and liquidating or replenishing \nadvances  up  to  a  maximum  amount  of  $200,000  per  contract.  The  imprest  account  and \nstatement of expenditures records will be audited annually separately by auditors acceptable to \nADB. \n \n  9.  Auditing \n \n67.  Project expenditures will be recorded according to the standard requirements of the \nCommission on Audit. All agencies involved in project implementation will prepare and maintain \nseparate accounts for project-related disbursements. UPMD will consolidate the accounts from \nthe various national offices and provinces and submit them to the DOH Finance Service, which \nwill review the consolidated accounts and, after audit, submit them to DOF and ADB. The audit \nreport will include a statement verifying that funds disbursed by ADB against statements of \nexpenditures have been used for the purpose for which they were provided. Project accounts, \ntogether  with  disbursement  documents,  will  be  audited  annually  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. \nA separate audit opinion on the imprest account and statement of expenditures procedures \nshould be included in the annual audit report. \n \n  10.  Reports \n \n68.  Quarterly progress reports will be prepared by every provincial project management \nteam, duly signed and endorsed by the governor as the provincial project director. These teams \nwill be responsible for coordinating project activities and for preparing reports on their status and \noutcomes. The reports will be furnished simultaneously to UPMD and the DOH regional health \noffice (regional project supervisor), and will be consolidated at the national level. UPMD will \nprepare its own report on the implementation of national activities funded by the Project. It will \nprepare a single report on project accomplishments to be submitted quarterly to the project \ndirector and subsequently forwarded to ADB. \n   \n11.  Project Performance Monitoring System \n \n69.  The project performance monitoring system will contain data and information on each \nhealth sector reform area, relevant management data and in particular detailed financial data \ndocumenting Project progress and adherence to principles of good governance. Achievement \nwill be checked against performance targets set by DOH at the beginning of each year. The \nperformance  parameters  will  include  (i)  activities  and  outputs  realized  vis-\u00e0-vis  plans  and \ntargets,  (ii)  independently  verified  physical  accomplishments,  and  (iii)  actual  costs  against \nbudgeted amounts.  \n \n70.  Specific  monitoring  forms13  will  be  developed  and  used  to  monitor  progress  and \naccomplishments. The monitoring system will be designed to enable prompt remedial action. \nEvaluation of the Project will be carried out primarily through a set of baseline and end-of-\nProject surveys. While a poverty survey has been undertaken during project preparation, a \ngeneral population-based survey is needed on the current status and outcome of the HSRA \ninitiatives in all five provinces to validate the indicative levels of outcome and impact indicators \nreflected in the HSDP framework. Available data in existing DOH and provincial reports are \n                                                 \n13 Under the leadership of DOH, donors and financing institutions are expected to agree on common formats of \nreports and monitoring forms for all externally funded projects that are supporting implementation of HSRA. \n ", "22    \ninsufficient to establish detailed objectives and targets for project activities in the next 5 years. A \nsurvey at the end of the Project will evaluate the impact of the HSDP on the overall health status \nin the five provinces at the time. UPMD will contract nongovernment organizations to undertake \nthe baseline and end-of-project evaluation surveys.  \n \n  12.  Project Review \n \n71.  A Project Inception Mission comprising ADB and DOH staff will be fielded shortly after \nthe project loan becomes effective. Yearly project review missions will (i) monitor progress of \nproject  implementation;  (ii) identify  areas  of  concern;  and  (iii)  suggest  remedial  actions.  A \ncomprehensive midterm review of project performance will be conducted to identify problems \nand constraints encountered during the first half of the Project and to adjust the design and the \nproject framework or take remedial actions as required. Technical or budgetary changes of the \nProject based on the results of the project performance monitoring system will be considered, \nas will additional activities, or expansion of activities and sites for the remaining project period. \n \n  13.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n72.  The Project will comply with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and guidelines. DOH and the \nimplementing agency will ensure timely submission of project accounts. Subprojects will be \nselected, components approved, and goods and services procured according to the agreed \nguidelines  and  criteria.  ADB\u2019s  anticorruption  policy  was  explained  to  the  national  and  the \npreselected  local  governments,  DOH,  and  PhilHealth  during  project  processing.  The \nanticorruption provisions added to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were also \ndiscussed, and the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement were \nemphasized. A strict project performance monitoring system will allow DOH and ADB to confirm \nthe appropriate use of project funds. \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Beneficiaries \n \n73.  The HSDP will contribute to the improvement of the health status of the population, \nparticularly  the  poor  and  other  marginalized  and  vulnerable  population  groups,  through \nimplementation of a package of reforms that will improve quality of health services, and facilitate \ntheir availability to the poor. Improving the health status of the population will impact on their \nhuman capital and thus on their productive capacities. For women, in particular, improved health \nstatus and reduced fertility through enhanced family planning and reproductive health services \nare anticipated to improve individual productivity. The HSDP will facilitate the empowerment of \npoor, marginalized, and vulnerable groups by supporting their participation on local health \nboards.  \n \n74.  The  Project  directly  targets  approximately  175,000  poor  and  subsistence  poor \nhouseholds, or close to a million people, in the five preselected project provinces: Ifugao, Ilocos \nNorte, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, and Romblon (in 2000, the five project provinces had a \ntotal  population  of  approximately  2.1  million  people,  or  400,000  households).  These \nbeneficiaries are composed of poor families, and vulnerable, and marginalized groups such as \nwomen of reproductive age (15-49 years of age), households headed by women, children under \n5, and indigenous people. Of the total number of project beneficiaries, more than half of the \nfemale beneficiaries will be women of childbearing age (15-49), and 13% will be children under \n5.  The  Project  will  ensure  that  at  least  (i)  95%  of  children  in  the  project  areas  are  fully \n ", "    23\nimmunized; (ii) the contraceptive prevalence increase by 15%; (iii) 90% of the poor are enrolled \nin the National Center for Health Promotion, either as indigent, sponsored, or individually paying \nmembers; (iv) 80% of births are delivered in a certified or accredited health facility and attended \nby a trained health care professional; (v) 70% of the poor and indigenous population are located \nwithin 5 km or 1 hour from a primary health care service provider; and (vi) 50% of the poor are \nusing primary health care facilities (BHSs and RHUs) or hospital out-patient departments for \ntreatment or preventive services. \n \nB.  Social and Poverty Analysis \n \n75.  The  primary  source  of  income  in  the  five  provinces  is  farming  followed  by  wage \nemployment in the formal and informal sectors. Other sources of income  include rents, and \nremittances (from family members who are working abroad or domestically). Poor households \nspend almost 50% of their income on food items. Because of their meager incomes, investing in \nhealth is simply not a priority for poor households. Improved access to quality and affordable \nhealth services is identified as a high priority among the poor in the provinces. Distance, bad \nroads, and inadequate transportation hamper access to health facilities, services, and providers.   \n  \n76.  To maximize the benefits for the poor, the Project will (i) construct approximately 160 \nBHSs, and upgrade and expand RHUs and BHSs; (ii) establish an effective mechanism for \nidentifying  and  prioritizing  the  poor,  and  determine  their  unmet  needs  for  essential  health \nservices; (iii) strengthen or help organizations/associations of the poor so that they can be \nappropriately represented in at least 70% of local health boards at project sites; (iv) train and \norganize barangay health workers and family health volunteers to promote healthy lifestyles and \ndisseminate information on essential health services that are made available at BHSs and \nRHUs in barangays with a majority of poor and indigenous people; (v) provide health insurance \ncoverage for at least 90% of the poor and indigenous households in the areas covered by the \nProject, and facilitate provision of social health insurance coverage to at least 90% of poor \npeople; (vi) provides technical and financial support for community-based health programs and \nprojects  targeting  poor  and  other  marginalized  groups  in  particular;  and  (vii)  upgrade  the \ncapacity of frontline health workers. \n \n77.  One of the main objectives of the HSDP is to make quality health care accessible and \naffordable for the poor and to meet the health needs of women in particular. A gender analysis \nwas conducted during HSDP preparation. Main aspects constraining women\u2019s access to health \nservice facilities are (i) lack of privacy in health facilities and inappropriate scheduling of health \nservice provision, (ii) lack of mobility and efficient transport, and (iii) lack of female health \nprofessionals. The gender analysis stresses that because of the constraints for women\u2019s access \nto health service facilities and their economic situation, women will benefit particularly from the \nupgrading and/or expansion of BHSs and RHUs into birthing and lying-in clinics in areas where \nthe  core  referral  hospitals  are  more  than  1.5  hours  away.  Aside  from  the  existing  health \nprograms being implemented by the BHSs and RHUs, core health packages for these facilities \nwill include enhanced services for family planning and reproductive health counseling. Women \nwill  also  be  the  major  participants  and  beneficiaries  of  information,  education  and \ncommunication campaigns. They will be actively involved in setting up the community-based \ninformation system for identifying and prioritizing the needs of poor women for essential health \nservices and social health insurances. Women will also be selected for skills upgrading in health \ncare since the majority of health caregivers in the communities are women. Finally, groups of \npoor women will receive limited financial assistance in the form of seed money to set up \ncommunity-based projects for health. \n   \n ", "24    \n78.  To ensure that the gender aspects are mainstreamed in the Project, a poverty and \ngender specialist will be included in the technical team of consultants. This specialist will (i) work \nwith DOH and other relevant stakeholders to design a community-based information system that \nintegrates gender and poverty issues in coordination with the community-based information \nsystem specialists; and (ii) develop a gender and development plan, monitoring and evaluation \nindicators; and specific gender and development reporting requirements. While not expected to \nhave  significant  resettlement  impacts,  implementation  of  the  Project  may  involve  limited \nresettlement and involvement with indigenous peoples. Participatory strategies for dealing with \nthese  issues  have  been  developed.  The  summary  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment, \nincluding  gender,  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples  is  in  Appendix  15,  the  summary \nresettlement framework is in Appendix 16, and a summary indigenous peoples framework is in \nAppendix 17. \n \nC.  Environment \n \n79.  The HSDP will rehabilitate and upgrade health facilities in the project area, such as \nhospitals, health centers, sub-health centers, and village health posts. An initial environmental \nexamination for project activities was completed during project preparation (the summary is in \nAppendix 9). The assessment and evaluation of the interventions showed that none would \nrequire  the  preparation  of  an  environmental  impact  assessment.  No  interventions/activities \nproposed  can  be  considered  environmentally  critical  or  are  projected  to  create  significant \nadverse or negative impacts on the environment. Although proposed activities/interventions, \nspecifically  the  upgrading  of  existing  health  facilities,  may  be  significant  in  degree,  albeit \ntemporary in nature, these impacts are avoidable, localized in scope, and mitigable through \nproper planning and the employment of appropriate construction methodologies. Positive socio-\neconomic impacts are predicted to occur as a result of the implementation of the activities and \ninterventions. Hospital waste management will become part of the capacity-building program \nleading to improvements in the environmental management of health facilities. All building and \ncivil works will be designed to minimize damage to the environment.  \n \nD.  Economic and Financial Analysis \n \n80.   The HSDP finances crucial structural changes in the sector, which have previously \nfrustrated HSRA implementation, specifically through (i) more efficient health spending; (ii) pro-\npoor restructuring of health budgets; (iii) rationalization of local health, public health and hospital \nsystems; and (iv) improvement of regulation, organization, and governance of the health sector.  \nOverall, the implementation of policy measures will result in additional costs totaling $280 \nmillion. In annual terms, the net impact is equivalent to nearly $100 million per year (a figure to \nbe compared with the 2001 recurrent health budget of about $702 million). The HSDP is \nassumed  to  increase  the  proportion  of  the  population  with  access  to  quality  health  care, \nparticularly  among  the  poor  and  marginalized.  Improvement  of  the  referral  system  and \norganizational reform of the management system toward integrated care, from the first point of \ncontact to the referral hospital, should have a beneficial effect on the overall system\u2019s efficiency \nat the provincial level. The sustainability of funds for sector reform has been considered and, in \naddition to the assurances in the policy letter, the contribution of the Government has been \nstructured to have no budget impact in the first 2 years and to increase with projected growth \nthereafter. In addition, the Project is structured to be affordable and revenue generating for the \nLGUs, thus providing an incentive for replication and a means of enhancing the sustainability of \nhealth care provision. The HSDP is expected to yield an economic rate of return of about 28% \n(Appendix 18). Considerable social return on investment is anticipated through: (i) resource cost \nsavings, and (ii) productivity benefits from a population in better health.  \n ", "    25\n \n81.  Financial analysis was also conducted on the nominated special purpose entity, MFC. \nMFC is scheduled to commence corporate operations in February 2005 with capital of P1 billion. \nTo ensure the financial viability of the MFC loan and sound financial management, MFC will \nmaintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10%\u2014in keeping with the requirement of the \nBangko Sentral ng Pilipinas for similar institutions\u2014and provide solid provisioning for asset \nquality. The financial projections for MFC are in Appendix 18. \n \nE.  Risks and Assumptions  \n \n1.  Political Risks \n \n82.  The governance of organizations involved in the health sector is weak and constitutes a \nrisk at the policy and management levels; both are subject to political interference. The HSDP \nwill therefore provide consultants to upgrade systems and train staff, and change organizational \nand managerial cultures through training, improved coordination, and involvement of the public \nin monitoring progress. \n \n83.  Political commitment by all parties is fundamental to progress toward the MDGs and to \nsuccessful  implementation  of  a  new  vision  for  health;  and  requires  the  finance,  economic \nplanning,  and  health  departments  to  collaborate  at  all  levels  to  create  an  environment  of \nsustained attention to the challenges linking macro-economy and health. A pre-requisite to risk \nminimization is anticipation and open discussion of the problems and the taking of actions that \ndirectly address them. In addition, the project loan provides appropriate incentives in the form of \nstaff  and  investment  resources  to  the  involved  organizations  to  support  them  in  HSRA \nimplementation. \n \n2.  Macroeconomic and Financial Risks \n \n84.   The economic and financial risks are considered less prominent as the HSDP does not \nintend to substantially increase health care spending. The lack of a viable credit market for \nfinancing the investment needs of the aggregate LGUs has inhibited infrastructure investment, \nwhich has affected the construction or rehabilitation of hospitals and other health infrastructure.  \nFor much of the health sector expenditures, LGUs will undertake cost savings and quality \nimprovements  financed  through  efficiency  gains  and  new  operations\u2019  modalities  that  allow \nsharing of facilities and services and economies of scale at the local level. Without the HSDP, \nthe likely success of such pathways could not be demonstrated and poverty reduction and \nachievement of MDGs would remain a distant objective. \n \n3.  Capacity Constraints \n \n85.  The capacity of organizations involved in the health sector is weak and constitutes a risk \nin three dimensions. Skills are limited and are constantly being eroded through emigration. \nFurther, inappropriate organizational and professional cultures also constrain reform. The HSDP \nwill therefore provide consultants to upgrade systems and train staff, and address organizational \nand professional cultures in various ways\u2014both directly and indirectly\u2014through training, better \ncoordination, and increased public accountability. Although the beginning of devolution in the \nPhilippines dates back to 1991 and the HSRA was published in 1999, the HSDP is the first \nintervention that aims at full implementation of the reform agenda in all its complexity. The \ndevolved functions of several components of the HSRA need to be operationalized and DOH \n ", "26    \nand UPMD should provide full support in the context of the project loan to mitigate the risks \nassociated with the limited capacities of many LGUs. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances  \n \n86.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  The policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the HSDP Loan \nAgreement, as described in the development policy letter, will continue in effect \nfor the duration of the HSDP loan period, and the Government will promptly \nadopt the other policies and take the other actions included in the HSDP, as \nspecified  in  the  development  policy  letter  and  HSDP  Loan  Agreement,  and \nensure that such policies and actions continue in effect for the duration of the \nHSDP loan period. \n \n(ii)  The Government will seek prior approval of ADB to any change of UPMD Project \nManager and of Provincial Project Coordinators, and will ensure that UPMD and \nprovincial PMU staff will be transferred no more than once in 2 years. \n \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that (i) an environmental assessment is carried out \nfor each Subproject in a participatory manner as part of the planning process of \nthe  Subprojects  and  in  accordance  with  the  Environmental  Assessment \nFramework  prepared  for  the  Project;  (ii)  based  on  such  environmental \nassessments,  an  environmental  management  plan,  including  mitigation \nmeasures, institutional arrangements, monitoring plan and sufficient budget for \nits implementation, is developed by the LGUs and approved by the UPMD; (iii) an \nenvironmental  impact  assessment,  where  necessary,  is  undertaken  for  each \nSubproject and submitted to ADB for concurrence prior to Subproject approval; \n(iv)  adequate  environmental  mitigation  measures  are  incorporated  into  all \nSubproject  design,  construction,  operation,  maintenance  and  monitoring \narrangements  in  accordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s  environmental  laws, \nregulations,  and  standards,  and  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  and  (v) \nmitigation  measures  and  monitoring  plans  required  in  the  subproject \nmanagement  plans  are  implemented  effectively  and  in  a  timely  manner \nsatisfactory to ADB. \n \n(iv)  In the event that land acquisition and/or involuntary resettlement are required for \nany subproject, the Government will ensure that (a) such land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement  are  undertaken  in  accordance  with  the  Borrower\u2019s \napplicable laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) \nand the Project\u2019s Resettlement Framework  as agreed between the Borrower and \nADB, and disclosed to public in accordance with the relevant procedures of ADB; \n(b) where necessary, resettlement plans acceptable to ADB are prepared, with \nappropriate participation of and disclosure to the affected people, and submitted \nfor ADB\u2019s approval; (c) measures indicated in such resettlement plans are duly \ncarried  out  prior  to  award  of  the  respective  civil  works  contract;  and  (d)  all \n ", "    27\ncompensation payments and resettlement assistance are provided to the affected \npeople prior to displacement and/or dispossession. \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998) and take all necessary actions \nto encourage women living in the Project provinces to participate in planning and \nimplementation of the subprojects. Furthermore, the Government will (a) make \nevery effort to identify and assign suitable qualified women to undertake Project \nimplementation activities at national or provincial levels; and (b) cause DOH to \nmonitor the effects of the Project on women through collection and compilation of \ngender-disaggregated data, where relevant, including in the resettlement plans \nfor the subprojects and the project performance monitoring system established \nfor the Project. \n \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous \nPeoples (2003) and the Indigenous People Framework prepared for the Project,  \n(a) adverse impacts on indigenous people are avoided or adequately mitigated in \na timely manner; (b) indigenous people are provided with opportunities to benefit \nfrom the Project in an equitable and sustainable manner; (c) affected indigenous \npeople are adequately consulted and provided with full opportunity to participate \nin  the  planning  and  implementation  of  any  mitigation  and  enhancement \nmeasures; (d) sufficient budget is made available and funds are disbursed in a \ntimely manner for effective implementation of the framework and any indigenous \npeople development plan that may be required; and (e)  implementation of the \nframework and development plans are monitored and reported to ADB through \nquarterly progress reports. \n \n(vii)  The  Government  agrees  that  no  disbursement  will  be  made  from  the  loan \naccount for any subproject scheme that is not based on transparent procurement \nmethods. \n \n(viii)  The special purpose entity for the project loan to be nominated as MFC, will \nmaintain financial ratios required by the appropriate regulator. \n \n(ix)  DOH  agrees  to  assist  LGUs  to  initiate  a  province-wide  media  campaign  to \nemphasize the Project\u2019s benefits and to stimulate community participation in its \nimplementation. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness of the Project Loan \n \n87.  The following are conditions for project loan effectiveness: \n \n(i)  The project steering committee will have been established. \n \n(ii)  The  Government  issues  the  Forward  Obligational  Authority  for  project \ncounterpart funds. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement of the Project Loan \n \n88.

The following sections summarize a more detailed analysis set out in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \nA.  Health Outcomes \n \n2.  General health levels, especially in relation to the Philippines' per capita income, are \nlower than in other countries of the region, except for Viet Nam, which has one third of the per \ncapita gross national product of the Philippines. The Philippines has a gross national product \nper capita 50% higher than Indonesia, but has lower nutrition, immunization, and safe water \nstatistics (Table A2.1). Other health variables, such as child mortality, tuberculosis prevalence, \nand maternal mortality rates also lag if adjusted for the relative income levels. Quality of care \nespecially for the rural poor has been declining in the Philippines, due to overcrowding of higher \nlevel public hospitals, reduced recurrent expenditures and a shift of public resources in favor of \nlarger institutions and tertiary care facilities and increasing levels of private practice by public \nservice doctors. \n \nTable A2.1: Comparative Health Statistics  \n  GNP per  Under  >5 Mortality  Maternal  1-year olds  Tuberculosis  Rural Pop  Poverty \u2013  Income \n  Capita ($)  Weight  rate  mortality  immunized  prevalence  with safe  rural (%)  ratio (high \n  for age  rate  vs Measles water  20%/low \nCountry  >5  20%) \nPhilippines  1,050  31.8  40  200  75  582  79  54  12.5 \nIndonesia  600  27.3  50  230  76  742  69  26.1  4.0 \nMalaysia  3,390  20.1  10  41  92  128  94  13.2  12.3 \nThailand  2,010  17.6  31  44  94  225  81  17.2  9.3 \nViet Nam  370  33.8  39  130  97  264  72  45  5.6 \nSingapore  24,150  2.9  4  15  89  28  n/a  0  8.5 \nGNP = gross national product, Pop. = population. \nSource: World Bank. 2000. World Development Indicators. \n \n3.  Health management issues are the major factors impeding the delivery of services for \nthe poor who rely on public facilities for both curative and preventive health services. However, \nprimary health services for the poor are understaffed and underfunded; lack drugs, medical \nequipment, and supplies; and provide poor quality care. Patients are bypassing these facilities \nand using the outpatient facilities at provincial and teaching hospitals for minor ailments. This \nleads  to  both  operational  and  allocative  inefficiency  in  the  use  of  health  care  resources. \nOvercrowding at provincial and teaching hospitals also prevents the provision of quality services \nfor patients who need higher level care. Improved management, reorganization, and additional \nfinancial resources are needed to improve quality of care at the primary health care level and to \nimprove access to quality health services by the poor. These issues point to the need for \nstructural change and health sector reforms. \n \nB.  Health Sector Reforms \n \n4.  Faced with budgetary constraints on one hand and the need to improve the quality of \nhealth care for the poor, on the other, the Government developed the Health Sector Reform \nAgenda (HSRA) to implement alternative means of managing service delivery and financing. A \nnumber  of  health  sector  management  strategies  have  been  developed  and  implemented \nthroughout the world to improve health services. The public sector can be made more efficient \nthrough decentralizing, and providing management autonomy for hospitals, and by providing \nappropriate incentives for staff at different levels. Additional gains in efficiency can be achieved \n ", "34   Appendix 2   \nby  contracting  out  specific  tasks  to  the  private  sector  and  nongovernment  organizations. \nHowever, implementation of any of these options results in additional administrative costs for \ntracking money and ensuring service quality. \n \n5.  The comparative advantage of any specific strategy for a public health system can only \nbe determined by conducting cost-effectiveness analyses based on appropriate incentives for \nthe various providers (see Table A2.2). Some options will require field-testing or operations \nresearch to determine their effectiveness and total costs. Only after that can they be expanded \nor replicated in larger areas. The degree of success in implementing health partnerships will \ndepend  on  effective  decentralization  and  the  active  participation  of  local  government  and \ncommunities. \n \nTable A2.2: Incentives for Health Providers \n  Provision of Services \nFinancing of \nPublic  Private \nServices \nPublic  Decentralization  Services contracted to private \nAutonomous hospitals  provider \nIncentives in public facilities \nUser charges \n \nPrivate  Private practice in public  Institutional provider funded by: \nfacilities  \u2022  Private insurance \nCommunity financing  \u2022  Pre-paid care \n  Individual providers \nPrivatization of health facilities \nand services \n    Source: ADB Studies. \n \n6.  The HSRA aims to provide these incentives and is the collective responsibility of the \nHealth Policy Development and Planning Bureau, Bureau of Local Health and Development, \nNational Center for Disease Prevention and Control, National Center for Health Facility and \nDevelopment, Bureau of Food and Drug, Bureau of Health Devices and Technology, the Bureau \nof Health Facilities and Services, and National Center for Health Promotion. The Philippines \nHealth Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) has been given the responsibility for leadership in \nhealth financing reform. The 17 regional health offices are the arms of Department of Health at \nthe local level to propel the adoption and implementation of health sector reform initiatives by \nlocal government units. \n \n7.  The HSRA is a plan to exercise, in a coherent and well-orchestrated manner, the policy \ninstruments of financing, regulation, information, and direct service delivery as mandated by the \nhealth reform enabling laws:  \n \n(i)  Public hospitals must become effective instruments not only for inpatient care, \nbut also for ensuring that subsidies are equitably dispensed through socialized \nfees. Moreover, public hospitals must be competitive and therefore influence \nservices and prices in the private sector. \n(ii)  Technical  leadership  in  public  health  programs  (information,  research,  and \ntechnical  guidelines)  must  become  an  effective  instrument  in  influencing  the \n ", "  Appendix 2 35\n   \neffectiveness of service delivery in the field that was devolved and shared with \nprivate providers.  \n(iii)  Multi-year  budgets  must  be  provided  to  ensure  that  priority  public  health \ncampaigns are sustained long enough to meet targets and demonstrate impact. \n(iv)  Local health systems, where local government units jointly govern and share \nresponsibilities for a health catchment area must be recognized as the frontline in \nservice delivery and sustained financing. \n(v)  The  capacity  of  health  regulatory  agencies  must  be  upgraded  to  effectively \nperform their traditional functions, as well as new roles in public information and \ncompetition promotion. \n(vi)  The National Health Insurance Program (NHIP) must expand enrollment and \nimprove benefits to reduce the financing burden, and leverage effective and \naffordable services from both public and private providers. \n \n9.  The reform areas are highly interdependent and complementary, and therefore should \nbe implemented as a package. Health financing reforms through NHIP expansion will make \nhospital autonomy viable and will ensure that the poor remain protected. Hospital reforms, in \nturn,  will  free  up  resources  for  investments  in  public  health  programs,  health  systems \ndevelopment,  and  health  regulations  at  national  and  local  levels.  Effective  public  health \nprograms and local health systems will relieve the NHIP from paying for hospitalizations that \nshould have otherwise been prevented or better handled at primary care facilities, and effective \nregulation will ensure that health facilities, equipment, and products meet quality standards and \nare competitively priced so that national and local health budgets and NHIP benefits get good \nvalue for money. \n ", "36   Appendix 3 \nLESSONS LEARNED \n \n1.  In general terms, the Philippines provides a clear example of the need to address core \nprimary health care (particularly communicable disease and reproductive health), targeting, \ncompetition, coordination, and sustainable financing (Table A3).   \n \n2.  Primary Health Care Delivery. A key issue is whether performance can be improved for \nthe poor by increasing their voice in decision-making. This can be accomplished in several \nways. The first is the direct management of local clinical services, through community health \ncenters or revolving drug funds, as in the Bamako Initiative. A second is mobilizing communities \nfor health-promotion activities, from malaria prevention to improved water supply. A third is \nparticipating in monitoring the performance of facilities and providers. Another issue is how to \nimprove accessibility. Physical proximity to poor clients can be improved through investment \ndecisions. But opportunities also exist for consolidation because of improved infrastructure; this \nshould be pursued to improve quality and productivity. Accessibility can be improved at lower \ncost not by duplicating available services in the private and charitable sector, but by allowing \nclients  more  choice  of  service  delivery  outlets  through  contracts  with  nongovernment \norganizations and private providers, and by improving technical efficiency and incentives among \npublic service providers. Moreover, nongovernment organizations may have greater experience \nin dealing with certain at-risk groups, such as people with disabilities or youth at risk of sexually \ntransmitted diseases, than the Government. Health care facilities, which have shown to be both \ncostly and inefficient at treating their intended beneficiaries, such as residential institutions for \nthe mentally ill or physically disabled, should be reconsidered in favor of lower-cost, higher-\nimpact services, such as day-care facilities. \n \n3.  More Equitable Government Spending. At the macro level, the key issue for the \nPhilippines is how facilities and insurance funds are accessed by the poor. Many developing \nand middle-income countries have developed core packages, which define health interventions \navailable at the village (health post), community (health center), and district levels (district \nhospital).  Effective  packages  respond  in  a  cost-effective  way  to  the  needs  of  the  poorest \nsegments of the population, and represent priority activities for public financing. They should \ninclude services that respond to the burden of disease afflicting the poor and should be linked to \npoverty maps to facilitate geographic targeting. Virtually all of the interventions are community \nand clinic-based, but they also require supporting infrastructure of population-based services, \ncommunication and knowledge dissemination, school health, and environmental health. \n \n4.  Competition and Input Markets. Governments have a major role to play in the two key \nmarkets that support and feed into the health system \u2013 the pharmaceutical and labor markets. \nThe availability of drugs affects the clinical quality of health services, costs, and perceptions of \nclients. Purchasing pharmaceuticals in the private market is also one of the main out-of-pocket \nexpenditure items for the poor. Key aspects to be assessed include selection, procurement, \ndistribution, pricing, and quality. Instruments for improving pharmaceuticals transactions market \nwide include (i) communications campaigns to improve the understanding of drugs among \nclients and sellers, (ii) social marketing to improve the quality and availability of drugs and family \nplanning  supplies,  and  (iii)  impartial  enforcement  of  regulations  to  protect  consumers.  By \nmaintaining and disseminating essential drugs lists and pursuing policies to encourage use of \nlow-cost,  high-quality  generic  drugs,  governments  can  improve  the  functioning  of  the \npharmaceutical system. Procurement in the public sector can be improved through an essential \nlists of drugs, supplies, and equipment; use of competitive bidding; and encouragement of \ncompetition in logistics and distribution systems. The labor market too is a key issue. The \nquality, distribution, and responsiveness of health personnel influence the availability, quality, \n ", "  Appendix 3    37\nand access to interventions by the poor. Issues to examine include (i) the total number and \ndistribution of various types of providers, by geographic location and level of care; (ii) retention \ncapacity of the system for trained staff; (iii) quality of education and technical skills, as well as \nresponsiveness to the client; and (iv) underlying incentives for provider performance, particularly \nin relation to poor clients.  \n \n5.  Governance Issues in Health Provision. A core responsibility of government in a \nmixed  system  is  to  exercise  effective  oversight.  Governance  becomes  more  important  as \ngovernments shift from direct service provision to a role dominated by policy; population-based \nhealth interventions; financing; regulation of providers and insurers; and guiding the system and \nbehavior through research, provision of information, quality enhancement activities, and careful \nuse  of  financial  subsidies.  Four  areas  are  key:  regulation,  coordination,  monitoring  and \nevaluation, and information. \n \n6.  Financing Sustainability. The issue here is whether the level of resources available to \nthe sector is sufficient to ensure the provision of essential services to the poor. Have resources \nbeen made available to sustain the chosen package of interventions? If not, have priorities been \nimposed  to  shrink  the  package  to  fit  within  the  constraints?  Sustainability  does  not  mean \nunlimited access to funds, but rather that hard decisions are made so that a functioning system \ncan deliver the highest priority services over time. The Philippines will need to address this \nissue in the context of its policy to ensure broad insurance coverage. A key issue is whether \nprepayment and insurance methods, when combined with public subsidies, succeed in creating \nan insured pool of poor and non-poor individuals, thereby offsetting the higher health risks of the \npoor by the lower risks of the better off. Typically, incentives, subsidies, and compulsion are \nrequired to achieve this goal.  \n \n7.   Project Experience. The principal lesson learned from recent projects in the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank's  (ADB)  health  portfolio  in  the  Philippines  is  that  that  implementation \ncapacity is crucial, especially for the performance of Local Government Units (LGUs). ADB \nexperience, in common with the World Bank,1 is that the following are necessary: \n \n(i)  Recognize that, under devolution, the LGU plays the major role in health care \ndelivery and DOH can act only in conjunction with the LGUs; as a corollary, \ninvolve  LGUs  as  active  partners  in  project  preparation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring. \n(ii)  Establish a professional project management office in the Department of Health \nwhile involving technical services in all aspects of project implementation. \n(iii)  Resolve fundamental cross-cutting management problems upfront (e.g., weak \nfinancial management, procurement, and human resource management). \n(iv)  Have a detailed plan for monitoring and evaluation ready at appraisal and use it \nin management and supervision. \n(v)  Introduce the complete package of project inputs for a given project area in a \nsynchronized manner to ensure quality production of the project deliverables. In \nparticular, ensure that soft inputs like training and advocacy/communication do \nnot take a back seat to civil works and equipment. \n(vi)  Plan and implement financing arrangements at the outset. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 World Bank. 2004.

Many recent projects are relevant to the Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) and an \nextensive aid coordination mechanism is in place. The following initiatives are of particular \nrelevance for the Health Sector Development Program. \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Integrated Community Health Services Project \naimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the health care delivery system through a \nhealth system development approach. The project was implemented in six provinces from \n1997\u20132003.  The  Women\u2019s  Health  and  Safe  Motherhood  Project  cofinanced  by  several \ndevelopment  agencies  has  four  components:  service  delivery,  institutional  strengthening, \ncommunity partnership, and policy and operations research. The Early Childhood Development \nProject is providing comprehensive assistance through the adoption of an integrated approach \nto child development up to 6 years of age. It is being implemented in three regions with co-\nfunding from the World Bank.  \n \n3.  United States Agency for International Development. The Health Sector Reform \nTechnical Assistance Project is directed at introducing health sector reforms in the advanced \nconvergence  sites.  The  Decentralized  Drug  Management  System  Project  supported  the \nassessment of the drug supply situation in the country, and resulted in the development of a \nprocess whereby centralized bidding takes place for an annual national supply. Other recent \nprojects have concerned assistance to local government units (LGUs) for hospital management, \nand social health insurance with emphasis on outpatient services.  \n \n4.  German  Government  Assistance.  Both  technical  and  financial  support  are  being \nprovided. The four components are currently being implemented in several parts of the country, \nand concern pharmaceuticals, local health systems development, social health insurance, and \nfamily planning and reproductive health. \n \n5.  The World Bank. Assistance to the Department of Health (DOH) includes preparation of \nproject  proposals  for  two  large  projects.  The  Health  Sector  Reform  Project  is  intended  to \nstrengthen HSRA implementation in four convergence provinces. The Women\u2019s Health and \nSafe Motherhood Project-II supports the objectives of Women\u2019s Health and Safe Motherhood \nProject and links them to the broader health sector reform process in selected sites.  \n \n6.  The Japan International Cooperation Agency. DOH is receiving assistance in support \nof  HSRA  implementation  through  four  projects  that  concern  upgrading  of  facilities  and \nequipment,  tuberculosis  control,  family  planning  and  maternal  and  child  health,  and  the \nprevention and control of sexually transmitted diseases. \n \n7.  Supplementary Appendix B sets out more details of external assistance to the sector. \nDetailed discussions have been held on coordination with all funding agencies, resulting in an \nagreement to harmonize individual project approaches as much as possible while maintaining \nthe medium-term objective to implement a sector approach under the leadership of DOH. The \nEuropean Union has expressed its intention to work with the Asian Development Bank on \nextending activities of the HSDP with grant funds after finalizing its project formulation mission \nat the end of 2004.

Health Sector Expenditure \n \n1.  The recurrent expenditure for health services was 96% (65% personnel salaries and \n35%  maintenance  and  other  operating  expenses),  compared  with  an  average  of  4%  in \ndevelopment expenditure from fiscal year (FY) 1998 to FY2001 (Table A7.1).

In 2001, total national health expenditure was 3.5% of gross national product.1 The \npublic sector provides both public health care services and personal care services, with the \nDepartment of Health (DOH) and local governments as the main players. DOH allocates the \nbulk  of  its  expenditures  to  personal  care  services,  and  the  local  governments\u2019  collective \nresources are spent on public care services. In terms of level of care, DOH spending goes \nprimarily to tertiary care (personal care), while that of the Local Government Units (LGUs) goes \nto primary and secondary care (public health). In terms of functions, DOH allocates roughly the \nsame budget shares to personal services and maintenance, operating, and other expenses \n(MOOE). In contrast, the bulk of LGU spending goes to personal services: resources are \ninsufficient for drugs, medicines, supplies, and facility improvements.  \n \nB.  Adjustment Costs \n \n3.  The adjustment costs for the reform program are estimated at $280 million over 3 years \n(Table A7.2). \n \n4.  With the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP), efficiency of health spending will \nbe improved through three main mechanisms. Fewer staff will be necessary to operate the \nsystem as a result of revised norms (staff size; doctors and nurses to patient ratios, number of \ndays per stay). Per person expenditure on health operating costs is expected to decrease as a \nresult of increased utilization of lower level facilities, and purchaser systems reform in social \ninsurance.  The  HSDP  will  encourage  a  pro-poor  restructuring  of  health  budgets.  Health \nspending will be better targeted as a result of the shift from personal care (tertiary level) to \npublic  health  support  (i.e.,  vertical  programs  for  tuberculosis,  malaria,  purchase  of  drugs, \nsurveillance, expansion of public health facilities).  \n                                                 \n1 National Statistic Coordination Board. 2003. \n ", "48   Appendix 7   \n \nTable A7.2: Reform Cost Estimates, 3-Year Period \n($ million) \nItem  Cost \nPromotion Participation, Linkages, and Public Accountability  10.00 \n   \nPublic Expenditure Reform in the Sector   \nA.

Health  care  financing  will  be  rationalized  through  establishment  of  management \ninformation systems connecting the Philippines Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) with \nDOH  and  hospitals,  establishment  of  additional  collection  centers,  technical  assistance  for \ndeveloping and pilot testing new insurance schemes and studies, incremental staff, additional \noffices, community-based re-insurance, and licensing and accreditation support. Subsidies will \nbe provided increase social insurance coverage of the poor (assuming 25% of the population or \n21.5 million people). Further structural adjustments will be achieved with a view to encouraging \nthe mobilization of extrabudgetary resources, granting hospital autonomy in managing revenues \ngenerated, and supporting the establishment of local health boards. \n \n6.  Taking into consideration the high capital and recurrent costs of health facilities, the \nGovernment will support the establishment of interlocal health zones (ILHZs) by improving and \nintegrating health referral systems (upgrading core referral hospitals, and satellite barangay \nhealth stations and rural health units). Under the proposed reforms, higher-level health facilities \nare to be rationalized in favor of public health and secondary facilities. HSDP implementation \nwill involve a radical overhaul of management processes at hospital and public health facilities \nalong with considerable strengthening of capacities for designing, managing, and implementing \nhealth  sector  reforms.  Through  the  Health  Sector  Reform  Agenda,  the  Government  is \ncommitted to support moves toward self-management and autonomy of health institutions at all \nlevels.  Participation,  linkages,  and  public  accountability  will  be  institutionalized.  Cost \ncontainment, output, performance-based funding mechanisms will become the basis of resource \nallocation. Finally, quality improvement and drug regulation will be reformed through clinical \npractice guidelines, procurement schemes, competitive pricing, devolution of Bureau of Food \nand Drugs, and establishment of national drug board.

Environmental Examination of the Project \n \n1.  Introduction \n1.  The proposed Health Sector Development Project (HSDP) is intended to support the \nimplementation of the Health Sector Reform Agenda (HSRA) of the Department of Health \n(DOH) and to enhance access of the poor to essential health services. In keeping with the \nthrusts and objectives of HSRA, the Project will focus on the implementation of reform in five \nareas, namely (i) hospital reforms, (ii) public health reforms, (iii) health care financing reforms, \n(iv) local health systems development, and (v) regulatory services reforms. \n \n2.   The Project is targeting five preselected provinces: Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, \nOriental Mindoro, and Romblon. The Project\u2019s three components\u2013health sector governance, \nhospital reform, and local health systems reform have environmental impacts. \n \n3.  The procedure adopted to identify all significant environmental impacts from different \nstages  of  subproject  development1  is  contained  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \nEnvironmental  Guidelines  for  Selected  Infrastructure  Projects  (Checklist  of  Environmental \nParameters for Urban Development Projects), and the results were checked for consistency \nagainst the new guidelines, except for the Sapalibutad and Pulongbulo subprojects where \nADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  were  used.  A  more  detailed  description  of \nenvironmental issues relating to the Project and a detailed initial environmental examination for \na typical interlocal health zone are set out in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n2.  Description of the Project and Environment \n4.  Subprojects will involve small-scale construction and civil works such as buildings, local \nroads and drains. Most are likely to improve the environment. All subprojects generate small, \nbut significant environmental impacts during construction. The proposed works by their very \nnature  mitigate  environmental  impacts  and  reduce  the  inherent  health  risks  attributable  to \nunplanned development of health facilities. The environment of the subproject sites is normally \nurban, albeit poorly serviced. No significant species of flora or fauna are expected to be found. \nTopography varies, but is generally flat. Soil conditions vary greatly. \n \n3.  Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  Impacts associated with small-scale civil works and small medical facilities common to \nthe subprojects, and recommended mitigation measures, are set out in Table A9.1. These \nrecommended  measures  are  simple  and  easy  to  integrate  in  the  feasibility  and  detailed \nengineering studies. \n  4.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring \n6.  Because  subprojects  will  normally  not  have  significant  environmental  impacts, \nparticipating Local Government Units (LGUs) will be required to obtain either certificates of non \ncoverage or environmental compliance from the regional Environmental Management Bureaus \nof the Department of Environment and Natural Resources. This will require consultant support \n                                                 \n1   Including location, design, construction, and operation stages. \n ", "  Appendix 9    51\nto  the  unified  project  management  unit  (UPMU).  The  component  of  the  investment  loan \nsupporting DOH will provide this, while institutionalizing the capacity within DOH. \n \n7.  The UPMU will not approve subprojects without the appropriate environmental clearance \nand environmental management plan. The steering committee will monitor compliance. Both the \nenvironmental management and monitoring plans are set out in Supplementary Appendix E. \nThe investment process is consultative, and project interventions will be discussed with the \ncommunity concerned. \n \nTable A8:1 Environmental Impacts and Typical Recommended Mitigation  \nMeasures for the Health Sector Development Project \nIssue  Degree of Significance \nA. Preconstruction Phase \n1.  Land and  No impact is projected as the Project involves only upgrading of existing facilities. No \nResource Use  additional facilities will be constructed; therefore, no additional land is required. \n2.  Water Quality  Since the proposed intervention only entails the rehabilitation and upgrading of \nexisting facilities, it is not projected to impact on the water quality in the area. \n3.  Air Environment  Levels of Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), SO and NO will increase as a \nx x\nresult of the operation of equipment and machinery and the increase in volume of \nvehicular traffic. However, this impact is temporary and short-term in nature, and is \nconsidered insignificant considering the project type and scale.   \n4.  Noise Level  The operation of equipment and machinery and the increase in the volume of \nvehicular traffic in the area will inadvertently result in increased levels of noise.  \nHowever, this is temporary and short-term and is, therefore, an insignificant impact. \n5.  Floral and Faunal  Since no additional land is required, clearing of vegetative cover  will not be \nCommunities  necessary. Habitat for faunal communities in the study area will not be affected. \nB. Construction Phase \n1.  Land and  No impact is projected on this parameter as the Project involves only upgrading of \nResource Use  existing facilities. No additional facilities will be constructed, therefore no additional \nland is required. \n2.  Water Quality   Since the proposed intervention only entails rehabilitating and upgrading    existing \nfacilities, water quality in the area will not be affected.   \n3.  Air Quality  Levels of TSP and other gaseous materials, such as SO and NO will increase as \nx x\na result of the operation of heavy equipment and machinery and the increase in \nvolume of vehicular traffic. Likewise, this impact is temporary and short-term and is \nconsidered insignificant. \n4.  Noise Level  The operation of equipment and machinery and the increase in the volume of \n  vehicular traffic in the area will inadvertently result in increased levels of noise, but \n  this is a temporary impact and short-term. It is a significant impact. \n5.  Floral and Faunal  Since no additional land is required, no vegetative cover will be cleared.  Habitat for \nCommunities  faunal communities in the study area will not be affected. \nC. Operation and Maintenance Phase \n1.  Land and   No significant impact. \nResource Use \n2.  Water Quality  The Project will not have a significant impact on the water resources in the area \nduring its operation.   \n3.  Air Quality  During this phase of the Project, the volume of vehicular traffic is projected to \nincrease. Consequently, emissions from these sources will also increase, primarily \nSO and NOx. The level of this impact, however, is projected to be lower than \nx\nduring the previous phases (pre-construction and construction) of the Project. \nOwing to the project type and scale, this impact is insignificant. \n4.  Noise Level  The operation of the rehabilitated facilities will have no significant impact on the \nnoise levels in the area. \n5.  Hospital Waste  During the operation phase of the proposed intervention, an increase in patients \nserviced is anticipated. Consequently, an increase in hospital waste generation is \nprojected. This impact is significant. \n6.  Floral and Faunal  During this phase of the Project, impacts on the terrestrial ecology of the Project \n ", "52   Appendix 9   \nIssue  Degree of Significance \nAssemblages  area are minimal to nil. No trees will be cut or vegetative cover cleared during this \nphase. Replanting of floral assemblages will be undertaken along the alignment. \n7.  Socio-economic  The upgrading of the health facilities will result in better delivery of services and \nresult in a healthy population, ultimately leading to a better quality of life. \n       effect \n    \n5.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure \n8.  Because  subprojects  for  the  project  loan  have  not  been  finalized  full  community \nconsultation was not possible. Pilot site investigations included opportunities for the public to \nparticipate in the design process of the subprojects.  \n \n9.  Participating LGUs will incorporate the process of consultation in their activities. The \nLGUs concerned will ensure that all those affected, including owners of assets and occupants of \nprivate lands affected by right-of-way acquisition and other physical developments in relation to \nthe proposed subproject are properly consulted. Individual visits and consultation meetings were \nconducted. Minutes of the meetings and agreements reached will be properly documented, \nincluding the master list of people to be affected.  \n6.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n10.  The assessment and evaluation of the interventions showed that none would require the \npreparation of an environment impact assessment. No interventions or activities proposed can \nbe considered to be environmentally critical or are projected to create significant adverse or \nnegative impacts on the environment. However, potential adverse impacts of some of the \nproposed activities/interventions, specifically the upgrading of existing health facilities, may to \nsome extent be significant in degree, albeit temporary in nature, localized in scope, and would \nnot have long-term deleterious impacts on the receiving environment. Moreover, these impacts \nare avoidable and can be mitigated through proper planning and the employment of efficient \nconstruction methodologies. Positive socio-economic impacts are predicted to occur as a result \nof the implementation of the activities/interventions. This will result in better living conditions for \nthe  poor  and  vulnerable.  Nevertheless,  it  is  recommended  that  an  initial  environment \nexamination of the specific subprojects be carried out during project implementation once the \nspecific facilities and their sites are identified, for a more detailed assessment of probable \nimpacts of the subprojects.  \n \n7.  Conclusions \n \n13.  The conclusion of the assessment is that the Project is expected to have a positive \nimpact  on  the  environment,  in  particular  because  of  improvements  to  neighborhood \ninfrastructure  and  because  of  improved  awareness  of  the  correct  procedures  for  handling \nhospital  waste.  Impacts  during  construction  are  expected  to  be  minor,  temporary  and \nadequately addressed by DOH, UPMU staff, and consultant resources available for the Project. \n \nB.  Environmental Assessment of the Policy Matrix \n \n1.  Description of Policy Interventions \n \n14.  The policy matrix set out in Appendix 5 sets out the reforms required in each of the five \nareas. The reforms, with one exception, involve reallocating existing health budgets to more \n ", "  Appendix 9    53\npro-poor use and increasing the efficiency of health care provision. The exception is, within the \nHospital Reforms component, the bolstering of regulations on the handling of hospital waste. \nThe policy interventions and their impacts are set out in the matrix in Table A9.2. \n \nTable A9.2: Policy Interventions and Impacts \n \nPolicy Intervention  Economic and Social  Environmental Impacts  Mitigation \nOutcomes  Measures \nHealth Care  Increase coverage and  None  None \nFinancing Reform  level of services to the poor \nHospital Reforms  More efficient local  Hospital waste management will   \nhospitals offering higher  be improved   \nquality services especially  Where new investment is  Project loan will \nto the poor  catalyzed some minor,  institutionalize \nparticularly construction,  appropriate \nimpacts may occur  procedures \nPublic health  More funding for public  None  None \nreforms  health especially for the \npoor \nRegulatory Reforms  Lower cost provision of  None  None \nservices \nLocal Health  More efficient local health  Where new investment is  Project loan will \nSystem Reform  services offering higher  catalyzed, some minor,  institutionalize \nquality services especially  particularly construction,  appropriate \nto the poor  impacts may occur  procedures \nHealth Sector  Supports the previous and  None  None \nGovernance  is focused on improving \nefficiency in the health care \nsystem \n \n2.  Environmental Management Plan \n \n15.  The only potential adverse environmental impacts are associated with subcomponents \nof two components. These components are under the supervision of DOH and the participating \nLGUs. The environmental management plan will thus be focused on improving the capacity of \nDOH and participating LGUs to correctly identify and manage environmental issues. This plan \nwill be formulated in detail by consultants working under the project loan. \n \n3.  Conclusion \n \n16.  The conclusion of the assessment is that the HSDP is expected to have no impact on \nthe environment. Where it catalyzes new development it will normally have a positive impact on \nthe environment, in particular because of improvements to neighborhood infrastructure and \nbecause of improved awareness of the correct procedures for handling hospital waste. Impacts \nduring construction are expected to be minor, temporary, and adequately addressed by the \nenvironmental management guidelines prepared by consultants funded under the Project. \n \n ", " 54 Appendix 10 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($ '000) \n \nTotal ADB Government\nForeign  Local  Total Foreign  Local  Total Foreign  Local  Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in the Philippines: The investment loan Project will \ncontribute to improving the health status of the population, particularly of the poor and other marginalized and \nvulnerable population groups, by implementing a package of reforms that will improve the quality of health care and \nensure access of the poor to quality health services.  \n \nImproved health status of the population will have a positive impact on human capital (the ability to command labor), \nwhich is a key asset of the poor. Improved health leads to higher productive capabilities. For women in particular, \nimproved health status and reduced fertility through enhanced family planning services will enhance their individual \nproductivity. In addition, the Project will facilitate the empowerment of poor, marginalized, and vulnerable groups. Their \nskills and competencies will be developed by supporting community-based organizations to participate in local health \nplanning and to increase representation on local health boards. These capacities become lifelong skills that they can \nuse in negotiating, claim-making, and searching for alternatives to improve their socioeconomic status.  \n \nThe Project directly targets approximately 175,000 poor households or close to a million people in the five project \nprovinces Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, Mindoro Oriental, and Romblon (in 2000, the five project provinces had \na total population of approximately 2.1 million people, or 400,000 households). These beneficiaries are composed of \npoor families whose incomes cannot meet the basic food and nonfood requirements, and subsistence poor families, \nwhose incomes cannot meet even basic food requirements. The beneficiaries also include vulnerable groups such as \nwomen of reproductive age (15\u201349 years of age), households headed by women, children under 5, and indigenous \npeople. Of the total number of project beneficiaries, more than half of the female beneficiaries will be women of \nchildbearing age and 13% will be children under 5.  \n \nThe Project will ensure that (i) at least 95% of children in the project areas are fully immunized; (ii) the contraceptive \nprevalence is increased by at least 15%; (iii) at least 90% of the poor are enrolled in the National Health Insurance \nProgram  either as sponsored, or individually paying members; (iv) at least 80% of births are delivered in a certified or \naccredited health facility and attended by a trained health care professional; (v) at least 70% of the poor and \nindigenous population are located within 5 kilometers or 1 hour from a primary health care service provider; and (vi) at \nleast 50% of the poor are consulting the barangay health stations (BHS), rural health units (RHUs), or hospital \noutpatient department for treatment or preventive services.   \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis       Targeting Classification \n   \nThe primary source of income in the five provinces is farming, followed by  Poverty intervention \nwage employment in both the formal and informal sectors. Other sources of  Targeted intervention (M 1\u20137) \nincome are largely rental incomes and remittances and subsidies from \nfamily members who are working either domestically or abroad. Household \nexpenditure analysis reveals that poor households spend almost 50% of \ntheir  income  on  food  items.  Second  to  food  comes  expenditure  on \nproduction/income-generating related activities. Education expenses come \nin third.  Because of their meager incomes, investing in health is simply not \na priority among poor households. Lack of access to quality health services \nis the common complaint among the provinces. Long distances, bad roads, \nand inadequate transportation hamper access to health facilities, services \nand providers.  \n \nPoverty incidence varies across the five project provinces. Compared with \nnational poverty incidence of 28.4% of families in 2000, three of the project \nprovinces have significantly higher poverty incidences. In 2000, Nueva \nVizcaya had the lowest poverty incidence (15.9%), followed by Ilocos Norte \n(18.2%), while about half of the households in Mindoro Oriental (43.7%), \nRomblon  (55.2%),  and  Ifugao  (55.6%),  were  considered  poor.  The \npercentage of households who will directly benefit from the Project is \n ", "  Appendix 15  63 \nsignificantly higher in the poorest provinces. The distribution of households \ndirectly benefiting from the Project is as follows: 67.8% in Ifugao, 27.5% in \nIlocos Norte, 28.3% in Nueva Vizcaya, 46.4% in Oriental Mindoro, and \n73.4% in Romblon.   \n  \nThe following specific mechanisms are included in the project design to \nmaximize the benefit of the Project for the poor: (i) construction of a total of \napproximately 160 BHSs, and upgrading and expansion of existing RHUs \nand BHSs; (ii) establishment of an effective mechanism for identifying and \nprioritizing the poor and determining their unmet needs for essential health \nservices; (iii) strengthening of organizations/ associations of the poor so \nthat they can be appropriately represented in at least 70% of local health \nboards in project sites; (iv) training and organization of Barangay Health \nWorkers  to promote healthy lifestyles and to disseminate information on \nessential health services that are made available at BHSs and RHUs in \nbarangays with a majority of poor and/or indigenous people; (v) provision of \nhealth insurance coverage for at least 90% of the poor and indigenous \npeople households in the areas covered by the Project; (vi) provision of \ntechnical and financial support for community-based health programs and \nprojects targeting poor and other marginalized groups in particular; and (vii) \nimprovement of the capacity of frontline health workers so that the poor can \nbe provided with quality health care. \n \n \nC.

Background \n \n1.  The  Government  of  the  Philippines  has  requested  a  $32.5  loan  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to undertake the Health Sector Development Program (HSDP). The \nHSDP  includes  a  civil  work  component  (the  Project)  aiming  at  expanding  hospitals  and \nexpanding or constructing rural health units (RHU) and barangay health stations (BHS) in five \ncandidate provinces: Ifugao, Ilocos Norte, Nueva Vizcaya, Oriental Mindoro, and Romblon. \nLand acquisition and resettlement (LAR) for the Project is expected to be minimal and, at times, \nunnecessary. RHUs and BHSs are small facilities requiring no more than 160 m2 and 60 m2 \nrespectively. Hospital expansion may need wider plots, but also in this case is expected to \ncause impacts below the \u201csevere impact\u201d threshold1 defined by the ADB resettlement policy. \nWhere RHU, BHS and hospitals will be renovated or expanded within the properties of these \nfacilities, LAR will not be needed.  \n \nB.  Compensation Policy Framework and Procedural Guidelines  \n \n2.  To plan the compensation of project impacts the Department of Health (DOH), the \nimplementing  agency,  has  prepared  Compensation  Policy  Framework  and  Procedural \nGuidelines  (CPFPG)  fitting  relevant  laws  and  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement  as \ndetailed in the Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice. The CPFPG establishes \na  compensation  policy  for  the  Project  inclusive  of  eligibility/entitlement  provisions  and \nassurances guaranteeing that eventual donations of land are fully voluntary. The CPFPG also \ndetails  LAR  preparation  and  implementation  procedures  and  activities.  Supplementary \nAppendix F provides detailed frameworks. \n \n1.   Compensation Policy \n \n3.  The  CPFPG  establishes  the  following  policy  principles:  (i)  negative  impacts  will  be \nminimized as much as possible and, unless absolutely necessary impacts affecting informal \nsettlers will be avoided; (ii) when impacts cannot be avoided compensation will be sufficient to \nimprove or at least restore the pre-project income and living standards of those affected; (iii) \nlack  of  formal  title  to  land  should  not  be  a  bar  to  compensation  or  rehabilitation;  (iv) \ncompensation activities will be carried out with equal consideration of women and men; the \ncompensation beneficiaries will be the documented owners independent of their gender; (v) the \naffected persons will be fully informed and consulted on compensation options and resettlement \nplanning; (vi) asset compensation will be provided at market rates (for land and crops) and at \nreplacement rates (for houses and other assets); (vii) compensation, replacement land and \nrehabilitation  provisions/allowances  will  be  provided  in  full  prior  to  ground  leveling  and \ndemolition;  and  (viii)  resettlement  and  compensation  costs  will  be  included  in  subproject \nbudgets. \n \n4.  The CPFPG sets eligibility/entitlement provisions for various losses and subsidies. Land \nlosses will be compensated in cash at market rates or through \u201cland for land\u201d arrangements. \nFull/partial  buildings  losses  will  be  compensated  in  cash  at  replacement  rates  free  of \ndepreciation, demolition expenses, and salvaged materials; crop losses will be paid at market \n                                                 \n1 Severe impacts occur when more than 200 national majority individuals or 100 Indigenous Peoples individuals are \naffected by losses exceeding 10% of their productive land or income and/or are relocated.   \n \n ", "66   Appendix 16   \nrates, and tree losses will be compensated based on the productive value of each tree. Finally, \naffected  sharecroppers,  house  renters,  relocates,  and  businesses  owners  will  respectively \nreceive a production allowance covering the value of 1 year produce in affected plots, a rental \nallowance covering a standard 3 months rent in project areas, a transfer allowance covering \ntransport costs, and a Business losses allowance based on tax declarations or local minimum \nsalaries for each month of interruption of business activities up to 1 year. \n \n5.  As it is common in local government unit (LGU) projects in the Philippines, land may be \nprocured through donations. This is acceptable under ADB policy, but only if the donations are \ndemonstrably  voluntary.  To  satisfy  this  requirement,  the  CPFPG  establishes  the  following \nconditions: (i) a donation is to be a donor\u2019s informed decision based on knowledge of his/her \nentitlement to compensation at market rates and asset compensation amounts; (ii) the donation \ndoes not affect the donor\u2019s livelihood; (iii) the plots to be donated are titled, are not rented out, \noccupied by squatters, or encumbered; (iv) the voluntary nature of the donation is documented \nby: (a) a signed Deed of Donation; and (b) by a signed statement that the donor is aware of the \nabove conditions. The inclusion of both documents in the LAR plan will be the basis for ADB \napproval for the plan.   \n   \n2.  LAR Preparation and Implementation: Activities and Procedures \n  \n6.  CPFPG approval by ADB and LGUs will respectively be a condition for project appraisal \nand province inclusion in the Project. ADB approval of the LAR plans will be a condition for \ncontract awards; LAR plan implementation will be a condition for civil works initiation. LARP \npreparation will entail: (i) identification of the plots needed by each subproject;  (ii) preparation \nof  an  impact  assessment/AP  inventory;  (iii)  valuation  of  affected  assets  at  market \nvalue/replacement cost; and (iv) public consultation/information activities. These activities will \nbe carried out by the Municipal Planning and Development Office (MPDO) with Barangay \nCaptains\u2019 assistance. Based on the above activities, the MPDO will prepare a budgeted and \nscheduled LARP fitting ADB requirements. As it is expected that each subproject will affect less \nthan 200 individuals (and less than 100 in the case of BHS and BHU construction)2 the LARPs \nwill follow in principle a Short LARP format.  \n \n7.  The  overall  responsibility  for  LAR  rests  on  the  LGUs.  The  Municipal  Planning  and \nDevelopment  Officer,  in  coordination  with  barangay  leaders,  is  responsible  for  LARAP \npreparation with funds provided by the LGU. LARP preparation/implementation will be based on \nintense public consultation carried through surveys and meetings and involving EA, LGUs and \nAPs. A summary of the CPFPG will be distributed to all APs. CPFPG and LARPs in Tagalog will \nbe made available to the public in each LGU. The same documents in English will be disclosed \non the ADB website. Grievance will be first lodged at the barangay. If no settlement is reached, \nthe grievance may be lodged to the MPDO. If still unresolved, a case can then be lodged at the \nProvincial Health Office and, if needed, further appealed at the central Project PMO. The last \navailable appeal option will be at the appropriate court of law. The MPDO will monitor LAR \nimplementation quarterly. External monitoring will be assigned to an external monitoring agency \n(EMA).  The  MPDOs  will  report  quarterly  to  central  PMO  and  ADB.  EMA  reports  will  be \nsubmitted to ADB semi-annually and will be supplemented by a final evaluation report at the \nend of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n2 ADB policy requires a full LARP when project impacts are severe (see footnote 1).   \n ", "  Appendix 17  67\nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES FRAMEWORK1 \n \nA.  Background \n \n1.  In  the  pre-selected  provinces  the  subprojects  may  affect  Indigenous  Peoples  (IP). \nConsidering project interventions, negative impacts on IPs will be limited to LAR, which, as \nalready noted, will be minimal, if not unnecessary. In view of this fact, the provisions set out in \nthe CPFPG are deemed sufficient to safeguard not only mainstream Filipinos but also IPs. \n \n2.   If the Project\u2019s negative impacts on IPs are extremely small, the positive impacts on \nthem are substantial. On the one hand the construction of new BHUs and BHSs will be carried \nout in remote areas where IPs have poor access to basic health facilities. On the other, the \nhealth services reform pursued by the Project stands to directly benefit IP stakeholders by \nincreasing the availability of doctors in isolated barangays, establishing less discriminatory \nmedical practices and attitudes, and providing health programs and delivery mechanisms better \npatterned on the needs of specific beneficiaries. In order to ensure that these benefits are \nsystematically extended to IP communities the DOH has prepared an Indigenous Peoples \nPolicy Framework (IPPF) based on a social assessment (SA), relevant local laws, and the ADB \nPolicy on Indigenous Peoples.  \n \nB.  The Indigenous Peoples Policy Framework \n \n3.  The IPPF provides a definition of IP, identifies the groups that may be affected by the \nProject and summarizes SA results and IPPF legal background. The IPPF also details IP policy \nprinciples, IP strategy and relative task organization and preparation. \n \n4.  IP Policy Principles. The IP policy principles for the Project are: (i) all efforts will be \nmade to distribute project benefits to IP communities;(ii) project interventions will be carried out \nin  full  respect  of  the  needs  and  traditions  of  the  IPs  and  will  not  lead  to  their  further \nmarginalization; (iii) IPs will not suffer unmitigated adverse impacts during or after Project \nimplementation;  (iv)  when  medically  beneficial,  the  IPs  traditional  health  practices  will  be \nincluded in Project programs; (v) health information materials provided by the Project will be \nhanded  to  IP  beneficiaries  in  a  language  they  can  understand  well  and  read.  (vi)  IP \nrepresentatives will be included in the Project decision-making process; (vii) IPs will be given \nbroad opportunities to participate in Project outputs design and in Project decisions; (viii) the \nProject  will  pave  the  way  for  the  formation/institutionalization  of  productive  partnerships \nbetween local governments and IP communities based on principles of equity.  \n  \n5.  IP strategy for the Project. The Project will not have a separate component for IPs. \nKey to the inclusion of the IPS into the design/implementation of the reformed health services \nand  other  Project  deliverables  will  be  an  intensive  participatory  process  involving  both \nmainstream and ethnic minority people. This participatory program will be carried for the entire \nduration of the Project through focus groups, community meetings, and questionnaires and will \ninvolve  IPs  both  as  Project  planners  and  as  project  beneficiaries.  The  objective  of  public \nparticipation activities is the incorporation of the needs of each significant social group in project \nareas,  including  IPs,  into  the  design/delivery  of  new  health  services  and  into  the \nplanning/construction of new health facilities.   \n \n                                                 \n1 See Supplementary Appendix F for details. \n ", "68   Appendix 17   \n6.  Organization and Responsibilities. Overall responsibility for the preparation and the \nimplementation of Project programs and for ensuring that Project benefits will be extended to \neventual IP communities, rests on the Provincial PMU. Data collection, participatory planning \nactivities, and the preparation of annual action plans will be carried out by an NGO, which, in \nthe relevant provinces, will include substantial IP staff. The annual action plans will have to be \napproved by the Provincial Health Board (PHB) and by ADB. \n  \n7.  IPPF Preparation Activities. After the establishment of the PMU the first activities will \nbe hiring the NGO that will carry out participatory planning activities, and the preparation of a \nwork plan. In provinces inhabited by IPs, the NGO will include staff from local IP groups and the \nwork plan will have to reflect the assurances established by the IPPF. Following this initial \nphase project preparation implementation will proceed by including the following tasks:  \n \n(i)  Data-gathering  for  the  Community  Based  Information  System  (CBIS).  In  relevant \nprovinces, this task will involve, through workshops, interviews and focus groups, IPs \nacross  gender  and  age  boundaries  and  traditional  leaders.  CBIS  information  will \ninclude: (a) IP demography and settlement patterns, (b) preferred location of new health \nfacilities, (c) agreed LAR compensation modalities; (d) IP perceptions on the way health \nservices are delivered; and (e) all data needed to develop tuberculosis eradication, \nhealth insurance, and reproductive health programs. \n \n(ii)  Annual Action Plan preparation. Based on CBIS data, the NGO under the supervision of \nthe PMO will prepare a scheduled and budgeted Annual Action Plan (AAP) detailing all \nactivities to be carried out in the year to follow, including, when relevant, specific \narrangements for IPs. \n \n(iii)  In IP provinces, the draft AAP will be disclosed for comments to the IP communities \nbefore submission to the Provincial Health Board for approval.          \n \n8.  Disclosure.  The  IPPF  in  local  language  will  be  distributed  to  all  concerned  IP \ncommunities. The IPPF in English will be disclosed on the ADB website. \n \n9.  Monitoring/Evaluation. The PMU will monitor Project implementation quarterly and will \ninclude a section detailing Project activities targeting IPs and IP degree of satisfaction. The \nfindings of the internal monitoring reports will be reviewed annually by an external monitoring \nagency (EMA). EMA reports will be compiled and submitted to the PMU and ADB annually. At \nthe end of the Project the EMA will prepare a final evaluation report on IP satisfaction. \n \n \n ", "          Appendix 18    69\nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Economic Rationale \n \n1.  The Philippine health sector is characterized by fragmentation; underproduction, and \nunderconsumption of public health and health promotion interventions; information asymmetries \nand underproduction of information; and limited effective access to basic care, particularly for \nthe poorest segments of the population. Inefficiency in the public delivery system is indicated by \nthe insufficient availability of affordable drugs and health personnel in the public sector provision \nsystem, and insufficient funding of public health as compared with personal care. The system's \noverall effectiveness\u2013in terms of health status achieved for the level of financial, physical, and \nhuman resource inputs committed\u2013is hampered by poor quality, limited effective access, and \nmicro inefficiency. The impact of the financing system on distributional equity is regressive. The \nHealth Sector Development Program (HSDP) aims to improve health care delivery to the poor, \nvulnerable, and other marginalized population groups. This section sets out the economic and \nfinancial  analysis  of  the  HSDP.  Supplementary  Appendix  G  provides  a  more  detailed \ndiscussion. \n \n2.   The HSDP is expected to yield an economic rate of return of about 28%. Although this \nassessment is based on a number of assumptions, sensitivity analysis indicates relatively robust \nresults.  Considerable  social  return  on  investment  is  anticipated  through  (i)  resource  cost \nsavings, and (ii) productivity benefits from a population in better health. Cost savings considered \nin the analysis arise from three sources: (i) efficiency gains in the hospital sector through \neconomies of scales achieved in the overall health service supply and optimum utilization rate, \n(ii) reduced transportation costs made possible by the availability of services closer to the \nbeneficiary population, and (iii) reduction of the drug bill through improved efficiency in the \nprocurement and distribution system. Productivity gains, on the other hand, result from fewer \nlives lost and less time lost due to illness. \n \nB.  Analysis of the Municipal Finance Corporation \n \n3.  The  Municipal  Finance  Corporation  (MFC),  a  government  financing  institution,  was \nincorporated and registered in June 2004 as an affiliate of the Land Bank of the Philippines and \nis the successor to the Municipal Development Fund Office. Its role is to facilitate the access of \nlocal government units (LGUs) to finance for development investment. MFC\u2019s initial paid-in-\ncapital is P2 billion. Using modest growth assumptions, MFC will continue to operate viably and \nprofitably in the next 6 years (2005, base year) by (i) generating income from low-cost sources \nof  funds  for  lending  and  investments;  (ii)  maintaining  sufficient  liquid  assets  to  meet  loan \ndrawdowns; (iii) preserving the balance between operating expenses, gross income, and total \nassets; and (iv) ensuring that its capital adequacy indicator meets the central bank requirement. \nMFC estimates its total assets will grow from P3.3 billion in 2005 to P4.4 billion in 2010 (Table \nA17.1), an increase of more than 6% annually. Income after tax is expected to average about \nfrom P143 million annually during the 6-year period (Table A17.2). A summary of the financial \nperformance indicators of MFC for the next 5 years confirms its solid commitment to preserve a \ncapital adequacy ratio that is higher than the central bank\u2019s mandated 10% (Table A17.3). \nProfitability  is  projected  as  better  than  the  estimated  average  for  the  banking  sector,  as \nindicated by a projected return on assets of about 2.4% at the end of 2010. The proposed Asian \nDevelopment Bank loan will account for about 57% of MFC\u2019s projected total assets by the end \nof 2010 and will, thus, have a positive impact on its overall financial condition. \n \n ", "70      Appendix 18 \nTable A17.1: Projected Balance Sheets of Municipal Finance Corporation, 2005\u20132010 \n(P' 000)\n \n  2005  2005  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nAccount \nAssets             \nCash in Banks  61.6  106.1  149.8  200.5  251.8  301.9 \nAccrued Interest Receivables  126.1  124.8  151.4  165.0  176.6  182.2 \nInvestments in TB  1,990.9  1,990.9  1,990.9  1,990.9  1,990.9  1,990.9 \nLoans Receivables  1,085.7  1,528.7  1,755.3  1,949.2  2,043.3  1,953.8 \nOther Assets  9.1  9.1  9.1  9.1  9.1  9.1 \nTotal Assets  3,273.3  3,759.6  4,056.4  4,314.6  4,471.7  4,438.0 \nLiabilities and Equity             \nAccrued Interest Expense  44.3  43.4  61.1  70.2  78.0  81.7 \nIncome Tax Payable  14.3  13.6  13.9  14.4  14.8  14.6 \nPayable to National Government  64.5  61.1  62.8  65.0  66.5  65.9 \nDividend Payable  12.9  12.2  12.5  13.0  13.3  13.2 \nLoans Payable  1,085.7  1,528.7  1,755.3  1,949.2  2,043.3  1,953.8 \nStockholders Equity and Retained Earnings  2,051.6  2,100.5  2,150.7  2,202.7  2,255.9  2,308.7 \nTotal Liabilities and Equity  3,273.3  3,759.6  4,056.4  4,314.6  4,471.7  4,438.0 \nMFC = Municipal Finance Corporation, TB = treasury bills. \nNote: Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \nSource: Municipal Finance Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A17.2: Projected Income Statements of Municipal Finance Corporation, 2005\u20132010 \n(P '000) \n  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010 \nAccount \nInterest Income - TB  119.3  119.3  119.3  119.3  119.3  119.3 \nInterest Income - Loans to LGUs  132.9  130.3  183.4  210.6  233.9  245.2 \nTotal Income  252.2  249.5  302.7  329.9  353.2  364.5 \nCost of Funds  88.6  86.9  122.3  140.4  155.9  163.5 \nGross Margin  163.6  162.7  180.4  189.5  197.2  201.0 \nTotal Administrative Expenses  20.2  26.8  40.9  45.0  49.6  54.4 \nNet Income before Taxes  143.4  135.9  139.5  144.5  147.7  146.5 \nProvision for Income Tax (10%)  14.3  13.6  13.9  14.4  14.8  14.6 \nNet Income after Tax  129.0  122.2  125.5  130.0  132.9  131.9 \nRemittance to National Government (50% of  64.5  61.1  62.8  65.0  66.5  65.9 \nNet Income) \nDividend Payment - LBP  12.9  12.2  12.5  13.0  13.3  13.2 \nNet Income after Remittance and Dividend  51.6  48.9  50.9  52.0  53.2  52.8 \nPayments \nLGUs = local government units, MFC = Municipal Finance Corporation, TB = treasury bills. \nNote: Figures may not add up to total because of rounding. \nSource: Municipal Finance Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable A17.3: Projected Financial Performance Indicators of Municipal Finance \nCorporation, 2005\u20132010 (%) \nIndicators  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  Average \nCapital Adequacy               \nEquity/Assets      62.7     55.9  53.0  51.1  50.4  52.0  54.2 \nTotal Debt/Total Equity  52.9  72.8  81.6  88.5  90.6  84.6  78.5 \nManagerial Efficiency               \nOperating Expenses/Gross Income  43.2  45.6  53.9  56.2  58.2  59.8  52.8 \nGross Profit Margin  64.8  65.1  59.6  57.4  55.8  55.1  59.6 \nEarning Performance               \nReturn on Assets  4.4  3.6  3.4  3.3  3.3  3.3  3.6 \nReturn on Equity  6.3  5.8  5.8  5.9  5.9  5.7  5.9 \nMFC = Municipal Finance Corporation. \nSource: Municipal Finance Corporation and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041223105212+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041203110207+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R264-04.doc", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "aj3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20041203030154"}}
