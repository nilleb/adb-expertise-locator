A transaction technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Public Sector Governance \nReforms is proposed to support the implementation of the Post-Program Engagement \nFramework (PPEF) of the Azerbaijan: Improving Governance and Public Sector Efficiency \nProgram (IGPSE) \u2013 Subprogram 2. This will help avoid any loss of reform momentum and \nsupport the Government of Azerbaijan in delivering on its commitment (reflected in the Loan \nAgreement for Subprogram 2) to deploy its best efforts to carry out the PPEF. Through this TA,1 \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be able to flexibly provide strategic policy advice to the \ngovernment in the implementation of rules-based fiscal planning, in state-owned enterprises \nrestructuring and strengthening of private sector participation, and in enhancing access to finance \nand improving the business environment to small and medium-sized enterprises. The reforms \nincluded in the PPEF and to be supported by the proposed TA are, in general, a natural sequence \nof the reform achievements under the IGPSE. \n  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The policy dialogue process under subprogram 2 was successful in charting follow-up \nreform steps that will be crucial to achieve going forward and that can benefit from further ADB \nsupport. The ADB and the authorities agreed on a PPEF through which both parties can lock-in \na working commitment to jointly prepare proposals for the next phase of associated reforms, i.e., \nreforms that are a natural sequence or necessary for subprogram 2 reforms to come to full fruition \nin terms of impact. As reflected in the new ADB Country Partnership Strategy for Azerbaijan \n(2019\u20132023), a second ADB programmatic assistance engagement is also being planned for \n2021\u20132022, and the expectation is that implementing the PPEF will help keep close policy \ndialogue engagement and the current reform momentum. The proposed TA is closely aligned with \nthe  new  ADB  country  partnership  strategy  (2019\u20132023)  and  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations business plan for Azerbaijan.2 It is also in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which \nprioritizes developing public sector and market institutions to support the development of the \nprivate  sector  and  enhance financial stability  (i.e.  operational  priority area  6 to  strengthen \ngovernance and institutional capacity). \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n3.  Policy Output Area 1: Implementation of Rules-based Fiscal Planning. The main \nimplementing agency will be the Ministry of Finance (MOF). \n \n4.  Medium-Term  Expenditure  Framework  and  Medium-Term  Fiscal  Framework \nimplementation. International experience offers guidance in this key reform area, showing that \nthe introduction of these crucial multi-year fiscal planning mechanisms will now require a number \nof annual fiscal cycles of assisted implementation. The MOF, Ministry of Economy (MOE) and \nhigh-level coordination bodies will be crucial in monitoring implementation practices, and in \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2019. \n2   ADB. 2018.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \nassisting line-ministries through such a fundamental change in the way budgetary and fiscal \nplanning is done in Azerbaijan.3  \n5.  Establishment of Fiscal Risk Management Functions. Azerbaijan does not currently \nhave a formal institutional framework for fiscal risks management (FRM), nor any MOF internal \nstakeholder with any of the associated functions of FRM. This was highlighted during the IGPSE  \npolicy dialogue as a potentially very costly institutional gap. The implementation of context-\nrelevant aspects of an Integrated Fiscal Risk Management framework must be made a priority at \nthis stage.4 Aside from key institutional design and development decisions, this also requires the \nacquiring of the necessary analytical capacity by several different stakeholders within MOF. The \ndevelopment of a roadmap to chart the possible multi-year sequence of steps and institutional \nefforts will be a crucial entry-point to this reform front. \n \n6.  Public Debt Management Strategy Implementation. The strategy approved in August \n2018 is a major achievement in terms of setting the stage for effective debt management \ndevelopment going forward in Azerbaijan. It brings about a more comprehensive approach to \nensuring sustainable and sound management of public liabilities, and it is explicitly aimed at \nfurther strengthening the country\u2019s financial sustainability, i.e. at meeting the financial needs of \nthe government (by reducing costs and better managing risks) and upgrading oversight (and \nestablishing \u201climiting\u201d) mechanisms.5 The new strategy also includes explicit objectives on the \ndevelopment of a domestic debt securities market (which will crucially depend on a much higher \nreliance on market-based domestic resource mobilization in local currency), which is actually a \npre-condition for the development of financial intermediation and access to finance in local \ncurrency in Azerbaijan. This is systemically important on its own. ADB TA will support the MOF \nand  the  Public  Debt  Management  Agency  in  implementing  this  strategy  going  forward,  in \nrecognition of the crucial importance of its strict observance. The TA will also support the MOF in \nthe development and issuance of internal regulations to govern and implement the restrictive \nstance (in the public debt management strategy) on the issuance of budgetary loans and state \nguarantees to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) (e.g. making proposals to establish a full-fledged \nconditionality framework)6 and financial institutions (to limit the use of such instruments). \n \n7.  Policy  Output  Area  2:  Further  State-owned  Enterprise  Restructuring  and \nStrengthening of Framework Private Sector Participation in Infrastructure. Output 2 will \nhave  several  implementing  agencies:  MOF,  MOE  and  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises \nDevelopment Authority (SMEDA)/KOB.  \n \n                                                \n3   MOF\u2019s planning practices and analytical capacity for fiscal forecasting will remain a crucial enabler of success in this \nstructural reform, especially with regards to the overall resource envelope, and must thus be developed further. \nTraining to line-ministries will be important throughout, and this might require the development and implementation \nof structured and targeted training plan. The Ministry of Economy (MOE) could also be an implementing agency, in \nthe extent to which the implementation of the MTEF depends on e.g. the issuance of guidelines and regulations for \nsector key performance indicators. \n4  This seems urgent not only with regards to the currently most relevant contingent exposures that the MOF must be \nable to identify and monitor (e.g. specific formal fiscal risks related to [state-owned enterprises] SOE exposures) but \nalso in view of emerging potential exposures that near future developments might produce (e.g. public-private \npartnerships [PPPs]). \n5  A number of crucial elements referred to in the new strategy are e.g.: quantitative targets, to ensure sustainability of \npublic debt; explicit ceilings on foreign currency and variable rate borrowing to minimize currently high exposures to \nthese specific types of risks (currency risk and interest rate risk). Significant restrictions on the issuance of loans and \nstate guarantees to SOEs and financial institutions are also to be established, etc. \n6  In line with the oversight mandate on this issue of the Special Committee chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister (and \nwith MOF as Secretariat). \n \n ", "3 \n8.  SOE reforms. It is crucial to continue to support the Government of Azerbaijan in \nstrengthening the centralized financial management control of SOEs, while in tandem helping to \ndeepen SOE sector-specific reforms. In the context of the latter, proposals will also aim to produce \nclarity on tariff and Government ownership policies. SOEs contribute 45% of gross domestic \nproduct and play a dominant role in the oil and gas, power generation and distribution, water \nsupply and sanitation, railway, roads, air passenger, and communication sectors. Many SOEs are \nsaddled  with  management  inefficiencies.  Further  corporatization  reforms  are  needed  to \nmodernize SOE management and management control practices across these entities.7 It is \ncritical at this stage that the reform path initiated in 2017 on improving centralized financial control \nand financial transparency of SOEs is sustained going forward with corporate governance and \nmanagement practice upgrades, and with deeper efficiency-enhancing, sector-specific reforms.  \n \n9.  Development of an effective Operational Framework for public-private partnerships. \nBuilding on the ongoing assistance to develop an effective, fiscally responsible and planning-\nrelevant public-private partnership (PPP) Policy/Program, and its setting of key future directions, \nit is crucial to establish the operational framework for PPPs and develop the gateway role of MOF \nfor fiscal risk management of PPPs in order to enable the proper piloting of PPP projects. Right \nsequencing  is  key  in  this  regard.  ADB  can  continue  supporting  the  development  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks and capacity for PPP development, \nto subsequently help develop an initial pipeline of projects to bring to market (as other multilateral \ndevelopment partners are also keen to assist with). A roadmap for this effort is crucial at this stage \nto ensure focus of reform efforts and consistency across all the parallel efforts deployed, and that \nthe latter are properly sequenced. A cautious approach to PPPs in Azerbaijan is warranted. Best \npractice in jurisdictions with similar very low capacity and experience in PPPs has (and rightly so) \nbeen to (i) prioritize the completion of an effective and fully-formal operational framework, (ii) \nmake policy choices that reflect a realistic assessment of the low initial capacity to develop and \nscrutinize transactions, and (iii) ensure the preparation of transactions ensures these are both \nbankable and fiscally-responsible.8 ADB can deploy TA to support these challenges, given its \nregional experience and its current and future involvement in Azerbaijan in crucial areas of reform \n(i.e. MTEF and public investment management, public debt management and FRM). \n \n10.  Policy Reform Output Area 3: Enhancing Access to Finance and Improving the \nBusiness Environment. Output 3 will have several implementing agencies: Financial Markets \nSupervisory  Authority  of  Azerbaijan  (FIMSA)  and  SME/KOB.  Support  to  Entrepreneurship \nDevelopment Fund (EDF) and the Mortgage and Credit Guarantee Fund (MCGF) can also be \nmade available. \n                                                \n7  Many SOEs incur recurrent operational losses that are in large measure a result of ineffective sector and non-sectoral \npolicy set-ups and decisions. By omission or commission, policy choices over the years have de-facto used SOEs \nas an instrument of specific economic and social policy, and this has not been the most effective instrument to \nachieve sustained outcomes. The consequent fiscal risks, and the periodic, ex-post, outright fiscal outlays that \nbecome necessary are still mostly provided in incentive-incompatible ways (i.e. not ex-ante nor contractualized, not \nperformance-based, etc). This perpetuates corporate management decisions that are inefficient (and, ultimately, \nfiscally more costly). Sector-specific reforms are key to lifting financial performance and autonomy of the respective \nSOEs going forward in Azerbaijan. In sum, among the current key, legacy issues of SOEs, (i) high level of foreign \ndebt and exchange rate vulnerability, (ii) dependency on cost-inefficient and performance-incompatible solutions of \nfiscal support, (iii) low accountability, transparency and reporting, (iv) fragmented and incomplete discharge of the \nownership function by the government, and (v) lack of autonomous and capable utility regulators to govern tariffs. \n8  For example, in terms of concrete policy choices, many countries with low capacity but still higher experience in \nproject finance than Azerbaijan have simply e.g. ruled out Unsolicited Proposals (USPs) from the initial decade of \nPPP efforts. Caution recommends that, at the very least, a moratorium on USPs could be in effect in countries like \nAzerbaijan until line ministries, the PPP Unit and MOF\u2019s fiscal risk management functions build capacity to both (i) \ntender  traditional  PPP  procurement  projects  and  (ii)  properly  analyze  all  financial,  legal,  technical,  social, \nenvironmental and fiscal aspects of PPP projects. \n ", "4 \n \n11.  Legal and Regulatory Reforms for Diversification and Access to Finance. In addition \nto reforms on credit information sharing, FIMSA has made important progress in establishing a \ncomprehensive secured transactions framework. FIMSA is also embarking on a significant effort \nto further develop the legal and regulatory framework for more inclusive and broad-based credit \nmarkets in Azerbaijan. This path is well-known to be the only effective and sustainable way of \naddressing access to finance issues, and it must be sustained and supported. FIMSA-led reforms \nin this regard can sustainably reduce credit risk premiums in financial intermediation in Azerbaijan. \nThe development of the legal, regulatory and informational underpinnings for financial and credit \ncontracts is now a policy priority. A focused ADB TA project has been approved in December \n2018 to support a continuation of these efforts with non-bank reforms, and the proposed TA will \ncomplement this engagement.  \n \n12.  SMEDA\u2019s policy coordination and implementor role. The government is trying to \npromote SME development through the strengthening of EDF and the implementation of the \noperations of the recently established SME Development Agency (SEDA/KOB). The Strategic \nRoadmap on SME Development targets to increase the share of SMEs in the country's gross \ndomestic product to 15% by 2020, and to 35% by 2025. The establishment of SMEDA, as a new \npolicy setting body to (inter alia) promote policy consistency within this reform front and across a \nsignificant number of different government initiatives of direct funding, can be a path-breaking \nmilestone in this context. ADB TA will be made available to support these objectives. \n \n13.  Direct Finance Support Initiatives. The further development of both the EDF and of \ncredit guarantee instruments in the now-merged MCGF can also produce a major step forward in \nthe promotion of market-based and sustainable access to finance. ADB TA can support sustaining \nthese initiatives. Government of Azerbaijan allocated resources for the credit-guarantee facility \nunder MCGF, and this initiative is now operating at confident underwriting monthly volumes after \na lot of important preparation on both process design and pricing in 2018. This initiative introduces \na price reduction effect between retail lenders and retail borrowers. This price reduction effect \nhowever can only be sustained and sustainable if it is rooted in effective risk pooling and \ndiversification effects (like any insurance mechanism) and not lead to an actual depletion of the \noriginal resources allocated to its operation (e.g. if average pricing is lower than the inherent, ex-\npost  cost,  of  risk  exposures  underwritten).  ADB  TA  could  support  ongoing  and  future \nimplementation efforts to make these initiatives sustainable, and to ensure that additional fiscal \nburdens  are  avoided.  ADB  TA  can  also  provide  policy  recommendations  (and  support \nSMEDA/KOB in its policy-setting role) to ensure that the several parallel efforts of direct (credit \nlines) support to the economy (i) remain consistent with the ongoing efforts by the Central Bank \nof Azerbaijan to develop money-markets and the interest rate transmission mechanism in local \ncurrency (e.g. interest-rate benchmarks in local currency, etc), (ii) do not impede ongoing efforts \nto address the \u201clegacy\u201d problems of asset quality in the banking system in Azerbaijan, and (iii) do \nnot disincentivize credit institutions from seeking market-based wholesale financing.9 \n                                                \n9 The latter is especially important in the face of eventual pressures from commercial and other non-commercial \nstakeholders to obtain additional fiscal support for their potential wholesale lending to credit institutions in Azerbaijan, \ni.e. effectively asking for a subsidy to their risk-taking on retail lenders. Such fiscal subsidy would take away incentives \nfor banks to improve their capital adequacy and risk management practices and governance, and would also not be \nconsistent with the thrust of the new Public Debt Management Strategy of Azerbaijan. These pressures are \nunfortunately a common occurrence in other banking systems (in other jurisdictions) that have gone through recent \nshocks to their asset quality. Many are now (i) in the midst of bank asset recovery and bank resolution efforts, and \n(ii) trying to rebuild confidence in the banking system. Experience has shown that stakeholders have often advocated \n(not always unsuccessfully) for the use of public sector administered funds (or the credit-enhancing capacity of the \npublic sector\u2019s balance-sheet) with the argument that there is no alternative. Unfortunately, all too often this ended \n \n ", "5 \n \n14.
