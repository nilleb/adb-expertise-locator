The Government of Bangladesh requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in April \n2007 to provide assistance in selecting private sector developers for establishing two clean-fuel \npower  generating  plants  on  a  build-own-operate  (BOO)  basis.  These  would  be  (i)  a  450 \nmegawatt (MW) gas-fired combined cycle power plant at Sirajganj and (ii) a 450 MW gas-fired \ncombined  cycle  power  plant  at  Meghnaghat  Phase-3.  ADB  conducted  a  mission  during  \n8\u201310 May 2007 and reached an understanding with the Government on the impact, outcome, \noutputs,  cost  estimates,  financing,  implementation  arrangements,  and  consultant  terms  of \nreference for the proposed technical assistance (TA).1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although Bangladesh has performed generally well on the macroeconomic front over the \npast decade, inadequate electricity supply has been a major constraint on economic growth and \npoverty reduction. The electrification ratio is still very low, as only about 40% of the population \nhas access to electricity. Per capita annual generation of only about 172 kilowatt-hours is \namong  the  lowest  in  the  world.  The  country\u2019s  current  dependable  generating  capacity  is  \n4,120 MW, while peak demand is about 5,000 MW. This has resulted in frequent power cuts \nand load shedding, and this trend is expected to continue in the near future. Erratic power \nsupply tends to increase consumers\u2019 unwillingness to pay their bills, and that leads to shortages \nof funds for maintenance. This, in turn, causes supply interruptions to industry and residences, \nhampers commercial activity, and jeopardizes public safety. Promoting sustainable economic \ngrowth by providing reliable power supply is the main strategic pillar for reducing poverty in \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program for 2006\u20132010. \n \n3.  While abundant water flows in the Jamuna-Padma-Meghna river system, hydropower \npotential is limited because of the flat terrain. Coal reserves, located in the northwest, are deep \nbeneath the surface and difficult to develop. One potential mine with a limited output of about  \n1 million tons per annum has been developed with external assistance to feed 2x125 MW power \nplants, and a study is being undertaken to review the feasibility of developing another coal mine \nin the northwest. The country's entire proven recoverable reserves of oil (including condensate) \nare  estimated  at  59  million  barrels.  Although  Bangladesh  has  had  some  successes  in  \nsmall-scale  development  of  renewable  resources,  these  are  peripheral  to  the  issue  of \ngenerating bulk electricity for the main grid. Bangladesh is, however, well endowed with natural \ngas, which is the only significant source of commercial energy in Bangladesh. At present, about \n85% of the power generation capacity in the country is gas based, 10% is based on imported \nfuel, and 5% is hydro. In terms of energy generated, about 90% of the total in fiscal year 2005 \nwas from gas-fired power plants. Present gas reserves and production are considered adequate \nto serve the existing power plants, and it is highly probable that additional reserves could be \ndeveloped to serve the needs of those power plants projected until 2025.  \n \n4.  Over  the  last  10  years,  consumption  of  electricity  in  Bangladesh  has  grown  at  a \ncompound annual rate of 8.1%, and it is expected that demand for electricity will grow at an \nannual rate of about 8.0% for the next 10 years. The ADB-funded power system master plan \nupdate projected that a total capacity expansion of 17,900 MW would be necessary through \n2025, of which 3,500 MW would be needed by 2010.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 May 2007.  \n ", "2                                                                                                                                        \n   \n   \n5.  As the Government realized that the investment requirements of the power sector would \nexceed the resources available in the public sector and could crowd out investment in other key \nsectors, it adopted a policy decision in 1994 to invite private sector participation in generation. \nThis was followed by a private sector generation policy in 1996. The Government made efforts \nto streamline its administrative and commercial procedures, and the private sector responded \nfavorably. As a result, Bangladesh was successful until the late 1990s in attracting the private \nsector, and particularly in generation (where ADB played a catalytic role). Since introducing the \nprivate sector generation policy, new capacity totaling 1,290 MW (a total of seven plants) has so \nfar been established by independent power producers (IPPs), which presently produce about \n38%  of  the  total  national  generation.  ADB  recently  evaluated  its  power  sector  assistance \nprogram2 in Bangladesh and recognized that the IPP project, in which ADB provided assistance \nin selecting a private sector sponsor, has been operating successfully and producing power at \nreasonable cost to Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) with a high level of reliability. \n \n6.  Despite past success, Bangladesh, like many other developing countries, has recently \nbeen facing difficulties in mobilizing further private capital for expanding power  generating \ncapacity. A worldwide trend shows that private investors\u2019 interest in IPPs in developing countries \nhas fallen off, and the number and value of transactions sponsored by these investors are well \nbelow their peak of the late 1990s. Coupled with the declining interest of private investors in \nIPPs in developing countries, perceived irregularities in procurement procedures aggravated the \nsituation in Bangladesh. As a result, several attempts to award contracts for new IPP projects in \nthe last few years failed. . \n \n7.  Recognizing this, the Government issued new public procurement regulations in 2003 \nthat are consistent with international procurement practices in order to enhance accountability, \ntransparency, and fairness in public procurement transactions for all sectors including the power \nsector. Moreover, the Public Procurement Act was passed by Parliament in 2006. The World \nBank is now providing assistance to the Government in implementing the new law, aiming at \nenhanced  transparency  and  efficiency  in  overall  public  procurement  transactions  for  both \ngovernment and bidders. As it will take some time for these positive effects to appear, urgent \nassistance is needed to carry out selection of sponsors for IPP projects under the present \nprocurement regulations in a way that instills confidence in potential investors. \n \n8.  In  December  2006,  ADB  approved  TA4898-BAN3 to  facilitate  further  private  sector \ninvestments  or  public-private  partnership  financing  for  power  sector  projects  in  a  flexible, \nefficient, and transparent manner, thereby contributing to enhanced and sustainable electric \npower supply in Bangladesh. TA4898-BAN will also help the Government to formulate the \nprivate  sector  participation  policy  and  enforceable  regulations  tailored  to  the  local  market \nenvironment.  While  TA4898-BAN  will  address  the  bottlenecks  in  the  policy  and  regulatory \nframework, the proposed TA is expected to help ensure transparency and fairness in the \ntendering process for the two power generating plants. That should attract more competitive \nbids  from  intended  private  sector  developers  based  on  the  existing  private  sector  power \ngeneration  policy  and  procurement  procedures.  In  parallel  with  the  assistance  of  other \ndevelopment partners, the TA will underpin efficiency and transparency in procuring future \nsimilar projects by strengthening technical specifications, improving bidding documents, and \nadopting best international practices and experience. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2004, Sector Assistance Program Evaluation of Asian Development Bank Assistance to Bangladesh Power \nSector.

Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  is  expected  to  contribute  to  sustained  economic  growth  in  Bangladesh  by \nproviding increased capacity and reliable power supply at an affordable price.  The outcome of \nthe proposed TA will be development of the 450 MW Sirajganj clean-fuel combined cycle power \ngenerating plant and 450 MW Meghnaghat Phase-3 combined cycle power generating plant by \nprivate sector sponsors for commissioning by 2010 on a BOO basis. The TA will assist the \nGovernment in the tendering process for selecting private sector sponsors for these two power \ngenerating plants through a transparent international competitive bidding process. The design \nand monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The tendering process will be conducted in two phases: (i) prequalification and (ii) main \nbidding. The purpose of prequalification is to identify qualified firms based on an examination of \ntheir experience in establishing, operating, and maintaining large-scale power plants, as well as \ntheir capability to raise the necessary equity and limited recourse financing. The result of this \nwork will be a list of firms with the qualifying experience and ability to execute the power \ngenerating plants, and only those qualified firms will be invited to submit proposals in the main \nbidding process. The main bidding process will involve soliciting and evaluating technical and \ncommercial  offers  from  qualified  firms,  then  preparing  project  agreements  (the  Project \nAgreements) that include a power purchase agreement, gas supply agreement, land lease \nagreement,  and  implementation  agreement  for  each  power  plant  to  be  signed  among  the \nGovernment, BPDB, 4 and the private sector sponsors. Given the relatively small volume of work \nand the nature of prequalification work that does not require a team of experts and extra support \nfrom the consultant\u2019s home office, and taking into account the urgency of commencing the \nconsulting services, ADB will assist the Government by providing specialized expert knowledge \nand advice for the prequalification stage. \n \n11.  A single-stage, two-envelope bidding procedure will be adopted for the main bidding \nprocess, wherein the bidders will submit simultaneously two sealed envelopes: one containing \nthe technical proposal and the other the price proposal. The price proposal will be in the form of \nthe bidder\u2019s respective guaranteed two-part tariffs for the sale of electricity from the power \nplants to BPDB under the power purchase agreement. Initially, only the technical proposals will \nbe opened in public at the date and time advised in the request for proposals (RFP) in the \npresence of those bidders who choose to attend. The price proposals will remain sealed and be \nheld in custody of the executing agency (EA). Following completion of the technical evaluation, \nand at a date and time advised by the EA, the price proposals of the technically responsive \nbidders will be publicly opened in the presence of those bidders who choose to attend. The \nprice proposals of the technically non-responsive bidders will be returned unopened. Only the \nprice proposals of the technically responsive bidders will be evaluated and the contract will be \nawarded to the lowest evaluated substantially responsive bidder.  \n \n12.  As the Government and the power sector entities have extensive experience from past \ntendering  processes  for  large  IPP  power  generating  plants,  the  EA  has  already  drafted \n                                                 \n4  BPDB has been designated by the Government as the single buyer of electricity in the country. \n ", "4                                                                                                                                        \n   \n   \nprequalification documents, and it will also draft technical specifications, the RFP, and the \nProject Agreements in collaboration with all agencies concerned. \n \n13.  The TA will assist the EA during the main bidding in (i) finalizing the RFP to invite \ntechnical and price proposals for implementing the project on a BOO basis, (ii) issuing RFP \ndocuments and publishing the RFP notice, (iii) conducting pre-bid meetings and responding to \nbidders\u2019 queries on the RFP, (iv) evaluating technical and price proposals, (v) finalizing the \ncontent of the Project Agreements, and (vi) negotiating contracts with the selected bidders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $600,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis through ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance \nthe remaining $150,000 equivalent in costs through in-kind provision of administrative needs, \nincluding office accommodation, data compilation, logistical office equipment, and counterpart \nstaff. A detailed cost estimate and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The EA will be the Power Cell of the Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources. \nBPDB will give technical support to the Power Cell by providing technical advice, data, and \nsuggestions to the consultants to be recruited under the TA. While providing logistical support \nand coordination with various stakeholders, the Power Cell has designated a project director \nand set up a project coordination committee headed by the Director General of the Power Cell \nto supervise implementation of the TA. The project coordination committee consists of high-level \nofficials representing the EA, the Power Cell, and other agencies concerned (including BPDB, \nPower Grid Company of Bangladesh Limited, and Petrobangla). The committee will discuss the \noutputs of the TA and provide feedback and guidance to the consultants. In particular, the \ncontent of the land lease and the power purchase agreements will be vetted by BPDB and that \nof the gas supply agreement by Petrobangla before the RFP is issued, as BPDB will be the  \noff-taker of the electricity generated from the Project and Petrobangla will supply gas to the \nProject.  The  Power  Cell  will  assume  the  secretariat  function  of  the  project  coordination \ncommittee. ADB will have the right at any time to scrutinize the tendering process.  \n \n16.  The EA will provide for the consultants office accommodation and facilities, internet \naccess, secretarial support, and land transportation within Bangladesh. The EA will also provide \nthe consultants with existing data, preliminary analysis as well as the draft prequalification \ndocuments and RFP. The consultants will incorporate the lessons learned from past similar TA \nof  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in  the  power  sector.  The  consultants  will  be \naccountable to both ADB and the EA. \n \n17.  The TA will require about 10 person-months of international and 15 person-months of \nnational consulting services. Appendix 3 provides outline terms of reference for the consultants. \nThe TA will be implemented over a period of 9 months from September 2007 to May 2008. ADB \nwill  engage  a  consulting  firm  or  consortium  of  firms  in  accordance  with  its  guidelines.5 \nConsultants will be recruited under quality and cost-based selection procedures, and simplified \ntechnical proposals will be requested.  \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2007.

The  consultants  will  submit  the  final  RFP  to  ADB  and  the  EA  within  1  month  of \ncommencing the consultancy services. It shall include details on the process for bid evaluation \nand negotiations, as well as the Project Agreements. All of this will be reviewed in a tripartite \nmeeting to be held in Dhaka and attended by the EA, ADB, and consultants. The consultants \nwill also submit the technical evaluation report to ADB and the EA within 1 month from opening \nof the technical proposals and the price evaluation report within 1 month from opening of the \nprice proposals. Before fielding of the consultants in Dhaka, the EA will provide the consultants \nall  the  documents  produced  during  the  prequalification  stage,  including  prequalification \ndocuments and clarifications, the prequalification application submitted by the bidders, and the \nprequalification evaluation report. \n \nIV.
