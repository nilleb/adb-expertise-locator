THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nand a proposed grant, both to Solomon Islands for the COVID-19 Rapid Response Program under \nthe Countercyclical Support Facility COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option.1 \n \n2.  The program will help the Government of Solomon Islands implement its countercyclical \npublic expenditure program, comprising its COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) \nand the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to address the impacts of the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic.2 The program will support the government to combat the entry and spread \nof COVID-19, provide social assistance to vulnerable groups, and deliver economic stimulus \nmeasures. The Solomon Islands economy is experiencing a significant contraction as a result of \nthe COVID-19 pandemic, and this is beginning to feed through to lower government revenues. \nWithout action, a continuing contraction in government revenues, coupled with increases in \ngovernment expenditure, particularly for public health preparedness and response, will develop \ninto a fiscal crisis.  \n \n3.  Solomon  Islands,  a  small  island  developing  state,  is  among  those  classified  as \nexperiencing fragile and conflict-affected situations. The government, the private sector, and the \ncommunity are not well equipped to deal with the wide-ranging implications of COVID-19. The \ngovernment\u2019s public health response to COVID-19, including closing the borders, has prevented \nentry of the disease into the country. However, it has come at a high economic cost. Income-\ngenerating opportunities are scarce and mostly based on natural resources. Exports have been \nhit hard because of COVID-19. As a small, open economy, the country is highly dependent on \nexports, which represent 42% of gross domestic product (GDP). The formal social protection \nsystem is limited in both programs and coverage, and therefore the government\u2019s ability to directly \nsupport the poorest and most vulnerable through existing programs is constrained. Solomon \nIslands is prone to disasters caused by natural hazards. When tropical cyclone Harold struck in \nearly April 2020, the country\u2019s thin capacity was stretched even further by having to respond to \ntwo shocks simultaneously. The country is ranked 145th of 160 countries in the United Nations \neconomic vulnerability index.3 These fragilities highlight the country\u2019s nonlinear development path \nand need for significant support from development partners.  \n \n4.  Solomon Islands meets all the access criteria of ADB\u2019s COVID-19 Pandemic Response \nOption under the Countercyclical Support Facility (Table 1).4 \n   \n \n1  ADB. 2020.

Adverse impact of  In 2020, the economy is projected to contract by 5% and the fiscal deficit is projected to \nexogenous  increase by 4.6 percentage points to 7.3% of GDP. External debt as a percentage of GDP \nshocks  is expected to almost double to 17.8% in 2020 as a result of the need to finance this deficit. \nThe current account deficit will increase by 6.4 percentage points to 15% of GDP in 2020. \nPoverty is projected to increase from 23.6% in 2018 to 27.5% in 2020.   \n2.  Countercyclical  The government has approved a total of SI$446 million ($54 million) to respond to the \ndevelopment  crisis, comprising of two components: a COVID-19 preparedness and response plan \nexpenditures  ($16.5 million) and an economic stimulus package ($37.5 million). The first component \nhas allocations for health, education, and social protection measures. The second \ncomponent has allocations for additional social protection measures, including through \ntargeted investments in agriculture, fisheries, and tourism; support to small businesses \nand state-owned enterprises; and bringing forward infrastructure projects.  \n3.  Pre-shock record  Economic growth was 3.9% in 2018 and 2.7% in 2019. Inflation was low at 1.9% in 2019. \nof generally sound  There was a fiscal surplus of 0.7% of GDP in 2018 and a fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP in \nmacroeconomic  2019. The current account deficit was 8.6% in 2019. Foreign reserves were equivalent to \nmanagement  8.1 months of import cover. \n4.  Structural reforms  The Governor-General declared a state of emergency on 25 March 2020 and Parliament \n(including health  extended it by for 4 months to 25 July. An initial amount of SI$27 million ($2.5 million) has \nresponse)  been allocated to upgrade hospitals, particularly by building isolation units that could be \nused as intensive care units. Medical personnel are being trained on infectious disease \nissues. Testing equipment is available and medical supplies are being stockpiled. Public \nawareness campaigns are underway. Development partners are providing funding to \nsupplement the government\u2019s efforts. \n5.  Debt sustainability  As a result of the crisis, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is expected to increase from 10.1% of \nGDP in 2019 to 17.8% in 2020 and 31.8% in 2024. Debt sustainability analyses conducted \nby ADB and the IMF conclude that Solomon Islands\u2019 public debt remains sustainable. \n6.  Coordination with  ADB was the government\u2019s lead development partner in preparing the economic stimulus \nthe IMF  package. ADB actively engaged with the IMF on the design of the package to ensure that \nthe IMF\u2019s policy advice was reflected in the final document. The IMF approved a $28.5 \nmillion program on 1 June 2020. ADB and the IMF have discussed arrangements for joint \nmonitoring of their respective programs where feasible.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund, SI$ = Solomon Islands dollar. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n5.  Development  context.  Solomon  Islands  is  ranked  153rd  on  the  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme\u2019s human development index for 2019 and is among the least developed \ncountries in the world.5 Solomon Islands is predominantly rural, with 81% of the country\u2019s \npopulation of 652,000 living in rural villages spread throughout its 9 provinces, covering 20 \nislands. The country\u2019s economy is highly dependent on commodity prices and demand from the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, which receives 66.8% of exports, representing 28% of Solomon \nIslands\u2019 GDP.6 Government constitutes a large proportion of the economy, with government \nexpenditure constituting 41.6% of GDP in 2019. Solomon Islands is categorized as a least \n \n5  United  Nations.  https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category-solomon-\nislands.html (accessed 21 May 2020). \n6  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020. Solomon Islands: Staff Report for the 2019 Article IV Consultation. \nWashington, DC.  \n ", "3 \ndeveloped country, although it is scheduled to graduate in 2024.7 While poverty has declined in \nrecent years, Solomon Islands has the second-lowest gross national income per capita among \nPacific developing member countries ($2,020 in 2018).8 With the World Health Organization \n(WHO)  declaring  COVID-19  a  global  pandemic, the Governor-General  declared  a  state  of \nemergency on 25 March 2020, which gave the Prime Minister broad powers to fight the pandemic. \nOn 27 March 2020, the government suspended all international passenger flights. On 7 April \n2020, Parliament extended the state of emergency for 4 months to 25 July 2020. \n \n6.  Solomon Islands is ranked sixth in the world for vulnerability to disasters triggered by \nnatural hazards.9 When tropical cyclone Harold hit the country, more than 30% of the population \nwere exposed to a combination of heavy rainfall and strong winds leading to secondary impacts \nsuch as storm surges, flooding, and landslides. This resulted in some loss of life and damage to \nproperty, food and water sources, and the natural environment.  \n \n7.  Pre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic management. The government \nmaintained  a  prudent  approach  to  macroeconomic  management  before  the  pandemic,  as \nreflected in its economic indicators (Table 2). Economic growth was a respectable 3.9% in 2018 \nand  2.7%  in  2019,  underpinned  by  logging,  infrastructure,  fisheries,  agriculture,  and \nmanufacturing. ADB had revised its growth projections upward to 2.7% for 2020, mainly because \nconstruction was starting on significant infrastructure projects.10 There was a fiscal surplus of \n0.7% of GDP in 2018 and a fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP in 2019. This reversal was driven by \nlower logging revenues and higher public sector payroll costs. The government, with support from \nADB and other development partners, has been implementing a public financial management \nreform action plan across several work streams, including (i) improving budget credibility, (ii) \nimplementing commitment controls, (iii) institutionalizing a comprehensive approach to cash \nmanagement, and (iv) supporting greater accountability of discretionary funds.11 While the current \naccount deficit was 8.6% of GDP in 2019, official reserves have more than 8 months of import \ncover. The country\u2019s external public debt level was relatively low, at 10.1% of GDP, but this was \nprojected to increase because of the government\u2019s ambitious infrastructure construction program. \nInflation was low at 1.9% in 2019. \n \nTable 2: Pre-COVID-19 Macroeconomic Indicators \nItem  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019p \nGDP growth (%, constant prices)  2.5  3.2  3.7  3.9  2.7 \nInflation (CPI period average)  (0.6)  0.5  0.5  3.5  1.9 \nTotal revenue (% of GDP)  35.1  31.8  32.8  34.3  30.1 \nTotal revenue and grants (% of GDP)  47.9  43.2  43.1  45.3  39.0 \nExpenditure (% of GDP)  48.0  47.1  47.5  44.6  41.6 \nOverall fiscal surplus (deficit) (% of GDP)  (0.0)  (3.9)  (4.4)  0.7  (2.7) \nGross external public debt (% of GDP)  7.5  7.6  7.1  7.6  10.1 \nGross official foreign reserves ($ million)  519.6  513.6  576.9  613.1  601.5 \n     In months of imports  10.0  9.1  9.3  8.5  8.1 \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  (3.0)  (4.0)  (4.9)  (4.5)  (8.6) \n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, CPI = consumer price index, GDP = gross domestic product,  \np= projected. \nNotes: Statistics for 2019 are estimates.  \nSource: International Monetary Fund Article IV Reports. \n \n \n7  United Nations. https://unctad.org/en/Pages/ALDC/Least%20Developed%20Countries/UN-list-of-Least-Developed-\nCountries.aspx (accessed 21 May 2020). \n8  World Bank data. https://data.worldbank.org/country/solomon-islands (accessed 21 May 2020). \n9  United Nations University, Institute for Environment and Human Security. 2016.

Health \nservices are delivered through a network consisting of 1 national referral hospital in Honiara, 11 \nprovincial hospitals, 35 area health centers, 107 rural health clinics, and 190 nurse aid posts.12 \nThe skills mix and distribution of health workers across provinces is generally uneven. Some 84% \nof medical practitioners and 53% of nursing staff are based in Honiara. Many health facilities \noperate without adequate water and sanitation; electricity; or basic medical, diagnostic, and \nsurgical equipment. However, Solomon Islands is served by a well-trained nursing workforce, \nwhich provides the backbone of service delivery in rural areas, and the number of doctors is \nincreasing.  \n \n9.  Compared with its peer Pacific small island states, Solomon Islands generally lags in \nterms of hospital beds, nurses and midwives, and physicians. There are no intensive care unit \nbeds in the country and only two ventilators (with an additional seven on order). In late 2019, the \nGlobal Health Security Index, which benchmarks countries on pandemic preparedness, ranked \nSolomon Islands 183rd of 195 countries.13  \n \n10.  Health impact of COVID-19. As of 2 June 2020, Solomon Islands had no reported \nCOVID-19 cases. This is attributable to the government\u2019s decisive containment measures to \nprevent people from entering the country and its relative isolation. The first travel restriction came \ninto force on 1 February 2020. Restrictions became progressively stricter, including increased \npatrols  between  Papua  New  Guinea  and  Solomon  Islands  to  enforce  the  border  closure. \nHowever, Solomon Islands is at risk of the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections because of its \nweak public health system, insufficient testing and tracing systems, and underdeveloped water \nsupply and sanitation services. Common noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes and adult \nobesity, increase vulnerability to COVID-19.  \n \n11.  Economic impact of COVID-19 and transmission mechanisms. The Central Bank of \nSolomon  Islands  (CBSI)  forecasts  a  5%  contraction  of  GDP.14 Other  key  macroeconomic \nvariables are also expected to worsen in 2020. The current account deficit is projected to increase \nfrom  8.6%  of GDP  in 2019  to  15.0%  in  2020  (footnote  6).  The  exogenous  shock  will  be \nconcentrated in the external sector. Logs account for 71.6% of all exports and 22% of government \nrevenues. Nearly half of the workforce is thought to be directly or indirectly associated with the \nlogging industry. Tourism, which is another important transmission mechanism, represents 5% of \nGDP. With no passenger arrivals, tourism has dropped to almost zero and may stay low for the \nremainder of 2020. The government has an ambitious infrastructure program, but this work \nprogram has stalled because of its reliance on imports of raw materials and skilled foreign labor. \nAt 1.5% of GDP, remittances are a small, but growing, source of income for the country, and a \nkey source of cash for poor and vulnerable households. Remittances are expected to fall because \nworkers cannot go to Australia and New Zealand, which have dedicated labor mobility schemes \nfor people from the Pacific. \n \n12.  Fiscal impact of COVID-19. A fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP was projected before the \nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of February 2020, the government\u2019s cash on hand was \nalready tight at 0.6 months of monthly expenses. This caused the government to manage its cash \nflow carefully, with a risk of accumulation of arrears. In March 2020, the government implemented \nmeasures to contain discretionary expenditures, such as reducing public servants\u2019 overseas travel \n \n12  WHO. 2015.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the fiscal deficit is expected \nto rise to 7.3% of GDP because of an expected decline in revenues and higher expenditures. \nRevenue declines will be led by lower logging and decreased economic activity will reduce income \nand consumption tax revenues. Government expenditure is increasing, especially in the health \nsector, but also through the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP). Fiscal deficits are projected to \npeak in 2020 and decline slowly during 2021\u20132024 but at lower levels, averaging 5.8% of GDP.  \n \n13.  Socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound \nsocioeconomic impact on the poor and vulnerable, especially women. More than 80% of workers \nare employed in the informal sector. More women than men are informal workers and 75% of \nwomen are in vulnerable employment.15 Interventions to prevent the entry and  spread of COVID-\n19 have already resulted in many women losing their livelihoods in the informal sector (such as \nroadside and market vendors, and microentrepreneurs). Decreases in income will impact food \nsecurity and nutrition for households without produce gardens or subsistence farms. In addition, \nthere have already been job losses for women in hotels, restaurants, and casinos, where about \ntwo-thirds of staff are women; and a loss of sales in other tourism-related businesses such as \nhandicrafts. Key factories that predominantly employ women, such as SolTuna, where 56% of \nstaff are women, have also announced that they will lay off workers if there is a lockdown.  \n \n14.  There  is  no  unemployment  insurance  to  support  people  who  lose  their  jobs.  The \nsuspension  of  nonessential  procedures  by  public  health  facilities  also  threatens  women\u2019s \ncontinued access to maternal and reproductive health services. The loss of income suffered by \nmany people means that they are unable to afford private doctors or medicines, and many \nsicknesses and chronic conditions are not being treated. This further heightens vulnerability \namong the elderly, people with disabilities, and those with preexisting health conditions. In \naddition,  already  high  levels  of  gender-based  violence  (GBV)  are  expected  to  increase, \nparticularly if there are restrictions on movement.16  \n \nB.  The Government\u2019s COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan and Economic \nStimulus Package \n \n15.  The government\u2019s response program consists of two major components totaling 3.7% of \nGDP: (i) the SI$137 million ($16.5 million) CPRP, approved by the Cabinet on 26 March 2020, \nwhich aims to minimize the risk of importation and spread of COVID-19 and reduce societal \ndisruption; and (ii) the SI$309 million ($37.5 million) ESP, announced on 4 May 2020, which is \ndesigned to ameliorate the economic impact of the pandemic, both immediately and in the short- \nto medium-term. \n \n16.  In  February  2020,  the  government  established  a  multiagency  COVID-19  oversight \ncommittee, chaired by the Secretary to the Cabinet, to coordinate the whole-of-government \npreparedness and response to COVID-19. The COVID-19 oversight committee ensures, on \nbehalf of Cabinet, the implementation of the CPRP. The National Disaster Operations Committee \nundertakes day-to-day coordination. The CPRP established eight subcommittees to monitor \nactivities. There is also an economic stimulus oversight committee responsible for monitoring \n \n15 Vulnerable employees are less likely to have formal work arrangements and are therefore more likely to lack decent \nworking conditions, adequate social security, and voice through effective representation by trade unions and similar \norganizations. Vulnerable employment is often characterized by inadequate earnings, low productivity, and difficult \nwork conditions that undermine workers\u2019 fundamental rights. \n16  Fully 41.8% of Solomon Islands women reported that they experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate \npartner in the last year. The prevalence increases to 63.5% if lifetime experience is captured. More than 30% of \nwomen reported being sexually abused before the age of 15. (ADB. 2015. Solomon Islands Country Gender \nAssessment. Manila.) \n ", "6 \nactivities to be delivered by the ESP. It reports directly to Cabinet and its secretariat functions are \nundertaken by the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT).  \n \n17.  Poverty and vulnerability extend throughout the general population, with 57% of the \npopulation living on less than $3.10 per person per day, only 16% connected to the electricity grid, \nand nearly half of rural households without access to toilet facilities. Considering also the lack of \ndeveloped social protection systems, activities targeting poor or vulnerable groups are embedded \nacross the various sub-components of the government\u2019s program, as described below. \n \n1.  COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan \n \n18.  The CPRP encompasses five areas: (i) establishing an integrated management system of \npreparedness and response through a whole-of-government sector approach, (ii) implementing \nhealth systems preparedness and response measures, (iii) implementing education systems \npreparedness and response measures, (iv) implementing livelihood preparedness and response \nmeasures, and (v) ensuring the safety and security of communities and health professionals.17 \n \n19.  Scaling up the health response. Significant activities have been implemented with \ndevelopment partner support, including the addition of 15 isolation unit beds at the national \nreferral hospital and installation of a COVID-19 testing machine at the national laboratory.18 \nHowever, significant challenges and gaps remain, particularly in the outer islands, including \nshortages of laboratory supplies and insufficient personal protective equipment for frontline \nworkers. Laboratory staff are receiving training on the use of test kits. An outbreak of COVID-19 \nwould require significant additional increases in health expenditure. \n \n20.  Social protection measures. Social protection measures under the CPRP are delivered \nunder the oversight of the livelihood and protection subcommittees. Preparedness activities to \nensure food security include assessing food stocks, stockpiling food rations, enhancing food \nproduction, and ensuring the adequate and timely distribution of emergency food rations. The \nCPRP  provides  1  month\u2019s  food  rations  for  100,000  households,  including  about  10,000 \nhouseholds headed by women, should a COVID-19 case be identified and further restrictions \nimposed. People living in urban areas (19% of the population), who have less access to gardens \nand other subsistence sources, would be prioritized. The Protection Committee is tasked with \nensuring that vulnerable groups have equal access to services and resources that meet their \nessential needs. This includes establishing active child protection and GBV subcommittees, \nensuring counselling services are available, coordinating with counselling providers and ensuring \nthey have access to personal protective equipment, readying public awareness campaigns to \neradicate  stigma  or  discrimination  against  those  infected  with  COVID-19,  and  assessing \nquarantine facilities to ensure they cater for people with special needs and other vulnerable \ngroups. \n \n2.  Economic Stimulus Package \n \n21.  The ESP is a combination of immediate measures to prop up aggregate demand and meet \nsocial protection needs, short- to medium-term measures to support the economy during the \nrecovery phase, and medium-term measures to promote growth. The package contains six \nactivities (paras. 22\u201328). \n \n17 Government of  Solomon Islands.  2020.  Consolidated  N-DOC  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan  for  Novel \nCoronavirus (COVID-19). Honiara. \n18 ADB provided a surge capacity specialist to strengthen clinical management of COVID-19 patients, infection \nprevention control, and capacity building for surveillance and contract tracing. \n ", "7 \n22.  Support for farmers as a form of social protection. This activity has multiple purposes, \nincluding increasing the incomes of farmers (a vulnerable group), enhancing Solomon Islands\u2019 \nfood security, and supporting a pathway to greater economic diversification and growth. This new \ngovernment activity has targeted 35,000 crop and livestock farmers, with at least 10,000 by June \n2021, and is prioritizing subsistence farmers who lack the funds or skills to expand production. \nGovernment support will include providing planting materials, fertilizer, pesticides, and training; \nensuring minimum prices; supporting compliance with food safety standards; and subsidizing \nfreight costs. The government will conduct gender analysis to understand women\u2019s participation \nthroughout the value chain to ensure that female entrepreneurs and other small agricultural \ncooperatives can be supported. SI$70 million ($8.6 million) has been allocated. \n \n23.  Support for forestry, fisheries, and tourism as a form of social protection. The \ngovernment is keen to diversify the economy and increase the incomes of fishers and tourism \noperators. The government has indicated that artisanal fishers and small tourism operators will \nbe the focus. For fishers, the government will provide training and cold storage around the country, \nsubsidize freight costs, and open niche export markets. For tourism operators, there will be \ntraining, the possibility of minor capital works, and greater marketing of Solomon Islands as a \ntourist destination. The government will provide support to the few sustainable forestry plantations \nto help these businesses expand their planting, milling, and exports. Support will be linked to \nattainable production targets and maintaining employment levels.19 SI$44 million ($5.5 million) \nhas been allocated.  \n \n24.  Social protection and community support measures. The government will provide \nSI$5 million ($0.6 million) in grants to churches and provincial authorities to support outreach, \nadvocacy,  and  awareness-raising  activities  on  social  distancing,  proper  hygiene,  available \ngovernment health services, and support to the poor and vulnerable households to weather the \ncrisis. In addition, the government will provide SI$5 ($0.6 million) million to help schools prepare \nto resume classes. This includes funds for hand sanitizer, face masks, and improved toilet \nfacilities. These measures will ensure continued investment in social services and will address \nthe  direct  impacts  of  the  health  crisis  and  recovery.  Finally,  the  government  has  directed \nbusinesses to maintain their pre-crisis prices and reminded them not to distribute unsafe or low-\nquality goods. The government has allocated SI$5 million ($0.6 million) to contract women and \nyouths to monitor prices according to price control regulations and report any breaches.  \n \n25.  Support to micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. The government will directly \nsupport micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) by (i) creating a SI$5 million ($0.6 \nmillion) facility to enable MSMEs to pay their rent; (ii) extending deadlines to pay taxes, and giving \na 5-year income tax break to businesses that are most directly affected by the pandemic, such as \ntourism; and (iii) providing the Development Bank of Solomon Islands with SI$20 million ($2.4 \nmillion) in equity and a further SI$15 million ($1.8 million) credit line to enable it to provide loans \nto MSMEs, including those owned by women. \n \n26.  Support  to  state-owned  enterprises  and  large  employers.  Many  state-owned \nenterprises (SOEs) provide essential services and are large employers. The government will \nprovide support to these businesses to enable them to continue their operations, maintain \nemployment, and recover once the crisis is over. Solomon Airlines, the primary provider of air \nservices, has been financially devastated by international travel restrictions. To enable it to \ncontinue operating domestically and to bring in essential freight, especially for the Ministry of \nHealth and Medical Services, the government will provide it with additional equity of SI$5 million \n \n19 The government has committed to collecting sex-disaggregated data on employment targets. \n ", "8 \n($0.6 million) and a loan of SI$15 million ($1.8 million). Solomon Water recently started an \nextensive capital works program, with ADB support, and its balance sheet has weakened.20 To \nensure service delivery is not compromised, the government will provide it with a SI$5 million \n($0.6 million) capital injection. SolTuna, which is an important exporter and large employer, will \nreceive SI$5 ($0.6 million) million in new equity. The Commodity Export Marketing Authority will \nreceive SI$2 million ($0.2 million) for marketing and testing the quality of agricultural products. \nThe government will provide SI$18 million ($2.2 million) to large private businesses to help them \nmaintain employment and continue exporting. \n \n27.  Infrastructure  projects.  This  activity  will  provide  employment  by  financing  the \nconstruction of wharves linking agriculture hubs in Kirakira and Malu\u2019u (SI$39 million or $4.7 \nmillion), bridge building in Malaita (SI$30 million or $3.6 million), and the upgrading of airstrips in \nSeghe and Taro (SI$21 million or $2.5 million). To ensure that these projects bring the greatest \neconomic benefit to these regions, local labor-intensive systems will be used where possible and \nmaterials will be sourced locally where feasible. \n \n28.  The ESP includes the following activities which, while not funded from the government\u2019s \nbudget,  will  support  vulnerable  people  and  businesses: (i)  each  Solomon Islands  National \nProvident Fund member will be able to access SI$5,000, which is expected to inject SI$200 million \n($24 million) into the economy; (ii) banks have offered to defer debt repayments for up to 6 \nmonths; (iii) Solomon Power lowered its May 2020 tariff by 16% (reducing its revenues by SI$6 \nmillion or $0.7 million); (iv) Solomon Islands Port Authority removed its domestic port charges for \nApril and May 2020 (costing it SI$6 million or $0.7 million) and is providing 2 extra days of free \nstorage  for  imports  and  exports  through  July  2020;  (v)  the  wholesale  supplier  of  internet \nconnectivity  from  the  recently  installed  submarine  cable  has  increased  bandwidth  to  retail \ntelecommunications operators by 50% for 4 months at no additional cost; and (vi) the government \npolicy, announced in late March, of halving the salaries of nonessential public servants (about \n25% of public servants) starting in May is reversed, and these public servants will continue to \ndraw their normal salaries. \n \nC.  Proposed Program, Impact, and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s program will contribute to the government\u2019s efforts in containing the pandemic and \naddressing its social and economic impact, particularly on the poor and vulnerable. The outcome \nwill be adverse effects of COVID-19 on businesses and the population reduced. The program will \nhave three outputs: (i) measures to combat the entry and spread of COVID-19 in Solomon Islands \ndelivered; (ii) measures to provide social assistance to vulnerable groups enhanced; and (iii) \neconomic stimulus delivered. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s value addition. A regular (often daily) dialogue between the government team and \nthe ADB team, comprising headquarters, regional office, and Solomon Islands Pacific Country \nOffice staff and consultants, was key in supporting the design of the government\u2019s ESP. The \npolicy dialogue enabled the teams to discuss and agree on the macroeconomic analysis and \nappropriate policy responses. Complementary to ADB\u2019s policy advice, ADB quickly mobilized \ntechnical assistance (TA) to facilitate dialogue, support the collection of data, and give the \ngovernment additional support to execute its countercyclical expenditure program. Given the \ngovernment\u2019s limited capacity, ADB is providing TA to monitor the program\u2019s outcome and \noutputs, and will provide further TA to support the government in implementing the ESP.21 ADB \n \n20  ADB. 2019.

Lessons learned. ADB has worked with the MOFT and conducted policy dialogue for \npolicy-based operations for an extended period. This engagement has focused on public financial \nmanagement and private sector development. The last program was completed in 2018.22 More \nrecently, ADB has provided TA focusing on tax reforms and improving budget execution (footnote \n21). The lessons from this experience include the need to (i) interact regularly with the government \ngiven its limited capacity, (ii) provide TA to supplement capacity, (iii) use existing mechanisms to \ndeliver support as creating new transmission mechanisms takes time and capacity, (iv) link \nimmediate policy responses with longer-term support, and (v) coordinate with development \npartners. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s pipeline. In meeting the government\u2019s desire for medium-term policy responses \nto support higher economic growth and address gaps that became apparent during the crisis, \nADB is ensuring that its future TA, project, and program pipeline is responsive to the government\u2019s \nchanging priorities. ADB\u2019s current regional TA projects will support the government in its work to \nmeet the financing needs of MSMEs and sustainable infrastructure.23 New region-wide TA \nprojects on social protection; MSMEs; gender; and water, sanitation, and hygiene will provide a \nbasis for larger interventions. ADB will continue its policy dialogue on public financial management \nand private sector development. Building on its TA on tax reform, ADB is designing a program \nthat will broaden the tax base and actively support economic growth (footnote 21). ADB is well \nadvanced in drawing up detailed designs and conducting due diligence for a land and maritime \ntransport  project,  which  the  government  sees  as  an  important  component  of  its  overall \ninfrastructure program and provide jobs for Solomon Islanders. Future health and education \nprojects will address gaps exposed during this crisis.  \n \n33.  Alignment with Strategy 2030 and the Pacific Approach. The proposed program is \naligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly the operational priorities related to addressing \npoverty, promoting rural development and food security, accelerating progress in gender equality, \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity, and strengthening regional cooperation and \nintegration.24 The program reflects Strategy 2030\u2019s approach to fragile and conflict-affected \nsituations and small island developing states, which recognizes their vulnerability to exogenous \nshocks and institutional capacity constraints. The program is aligned with the three strategic \npriorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020, which serves as the country strategy for \nSolomon Islands, specifically reducing costs, managing risks, and enabling value creation.25 \n \nD.  Development Partner Coordination \n \n34.  Government-led  coordination.  The  government,  through  its  oversight  committees, \nprovides strategic direction and coordination. The government has received funds and donations \nof medical supplies and equipment from Australia, New Zealand, the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand  the  United  States.  WHO  has  provided  training  and  technical  guidance  on  critical \npreparedness, readiness, and response actions for COVID-19. UNICEF has provided training for \n \n22 ADB. 2018.

Under the Biketawa Declaration, a framework agreed to by all the leaders \nof the Pacific Island Forum countries for coordinating responses to regional crises, Solomon \nIslands is also entitled to assistance through the Pacific Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19. \nThis is coordinated with regional and global bodies such as WHO.26 The World Bank is preparing \na $5 million health project under its fast-track facility for COVID-19 response.27 \n \n35.  ADB coordination as lead development partner in preparing Economic Stimulus \nPackage. ADB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have had regular bilateral meetings on \nmacroeconomic and fiscal issues, and as part of wider development partner discussions on \nsupporting the government during the crisis. ADB, as lead donor supporting the government in \npreparing the ESP, coordinated the policy advice provided by Australia, the European Union, the \nIMF, New Zealand, and the World Bank.  \n \nE.  Development Financing Needs, Budget Support, and Debt Sustainability  \n \n36.  Solomon Islands\u2019 revised fiscal deficit for 2020 is 7.3% of GDP. The government\u2019s \nfinancing requirement is expected to reach $106.9 million, including a financing gap caused by \nCOVID-19 of about $52.2 million. This financing gap, which is attributable to lower revenue \nbecause of lower economic activity and higher expenditure as a result of the ESP package and \nhigher health expenditures, will be largely financed by development partners. ADB will provide \n$26 million in 2020, of which $20 million is from this program and $6 million was provided in April \n2020 under the Pacific Disaster Resilience Program.28 The balance will be provided by other \ndevelopment partners and a domestic bond issuance (Table 3). There is still a small financing \ngap which will be resolved by finding savings in the budget or additional budget support. \n \nTable 3: Urgent Financing Needs and Support for 2020 ($ million) \nItem  2020 (before COVID-19)  2020 (adjusted for COVID-19) \nFinancing requirement  54.7  106.9 \nDomestic sources     \nDomestic bond issuance  0.0  14.5 \nDividends from state-owned enterprises  0.0  1.8 \nSubtotal  0.0  16.3 \nExternal sources     \nADB COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option  0.0  20.0 \nADB Pacific Disaster Resilience Programa  0.0  6.0 \nAustralia  8.5  8.5 \nEuropean Union  6.7  6.7 \nInternational Monetary Fundb  0.0  28.5 \nNew Zealand  1.8  1.8 \nWorld Bank  10.0  15.0 \nSubtotal  27.0  86.5 \nTotals  27.0  102.8 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease. \na Comprising a $3 million concessional ordinary capital resources loan and a $3 million Asian Development Fund grant. \nb Financed using the Rapid Financing Instrument and Rapid Credit Facility. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n26 The Humanitarian Pathway on COVID-19 supports the timely movement of medical supplies, technical experts, and \nhumanitarian assistance to Pacific Island Forum Members.

The pathway is \nsupported by a regional taskforce made up of senior officials of Forum Members, the Council of Regional \nOrganizations of the Pacific agencies, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, WHO, \nregional law enforcement and legal agencies, and the forum secretary. \n27 World Bank. 2020. COVID-19 Emergency Response Project. Washington, DC. \n28  ADB. 2019. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Policy-Based Grants for the Proposed Pacific Disaster Resilience Program (Phase 2). Manila. \n ", "11 \n37.  The government has requested (i) a concessional loan of $10 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $10 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \n(Asian Development Fund) to help finance the program. The loan will have a 24-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and \n1.5% per year thereafter; and such other terms and conditions as are set forth in the draft loan \nagreement. The government\u2019s development policy letter is in Appendix 3. \n \n38.  In 2019, Solomon Islands\u2019 public debt\u2013GDP ratio was low at 10.1%. Public external debt \nstood at $98 million, primarily from ADB (50%) and the International Development Association \n(39%). Public domestic debt stood at SI$245 million ($29.6 million), which was primarily bonds \nissued to the Solomon Islands National Provident Fund (SI$180 million or $21.6 million). On 25 \nApril  2020,  the  government  issued  a  SI$120  million  ($14.5  million)  COVID-19  domestic \ndevelopment bond. The current low debt levels leave space to absorb shocks such as the COVID-\n19 pandemic. With most development partners providing support through grants, public external \ndebt by the end of 2020 will still be at prudent levels, with a debt\u2013GDP ratio of 17.8%, despite the \neconomic contraction. However, the ratio is projected to increase to 31.8% by 2024 because of \nsignificant new infrastructure projects. The debt sustainability analyses of ADB and the IMF \nconclude that Solomon Islands\u2019 public debt remains sustainable and at moderate risk of debt \ndistress despite its rising trend, and that the loan provided under the program will not aggravate \nthe country\u2019s debt vulnerability and risks in the medium term.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n39.  The MOFT will be the executing agency for the program. The MOFT will monitor budget \nexecution and the flow of funds for countercyclical measures, and will submit quarterly reports to \nADB on expenditures made from the national budget to support the countercyclical measures. \nADB will provide TA resources to supplement the government\u2019s capacity in monitoring the \nimplementation of the government\u2019s program. In coordination with the government and other \ndevelopment partners, ADB will monitor outcome-level information throughout the implementation \nof the program using an existing TA (footnote 21). The ADB program implementation period is \nFebruary 2020 to June 2021. The loan and grant will be disbursed to a government account at \nthe CBSI in a single tranche upon loan and grant effectiveness, which is expected in July 2020. \nThe  proceeds  of  the  loan  and  grant  will  be  withdrawn  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time).29 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n40.  Governance. The latest public expenditure and financial accountability assessment took \nplace in 2012. It showed that most areas of public financial management had improved since the \n2008 assessment, particularly in budget credibility, budget comprehensiveness and transparency, \nand policy-based budgeting. ADB is providing TA to help the MOFT improve budget execution, \nwhich will also support monitoring of the government\u2019s countercyclical program (footnote 21). \nADB provided support for corporate governance reform, which contributed to a turnaround in the \nfinancial  performance  of  SOEs.  There  is  a  lack  of  procurement  capacity  and  expertise  in \ngovernment ministries. An anticorruption act was adopted in 2018. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998, as amended to date) was explained to the government and the MOFT. \n \n41.  Poverty. Although poverty has declined considerably\u2014from 45.6% of the population living \nbelow the international poverty line of $1.90 per day in 2006 to 23.6% in 2018\u2014it remains \n \n29 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nsubstantial. Two-thirds of rural households must travel to their main source of drinking water, \nwhich is usually a community standpipe (45% of households) or a river or spring (25% of \nhouseholds). Wood and coconut shells are the main energy source for cooking for 90% of \nhouseholds. Households spend 49% of their income on food\u2014mostly on rice, bread, flour, and \nnoodles,  as  89%  of  households  grow  their  own  vegetables.  Average  household  health \nexpenditures are less than $20 per year. \n42.  There is no system of unemployment insurance to cushion the impact of job losses. As \nfamilies cut back on food expenditures, the already high malnutrition rates for rural infants (20%) \nand young children aged 2\u20135 (40%) are likely to increase.30 An increased inability to pay school \nfees means that the secondary school graduation rate, which at 7% for girls is one of the lowest \nin the world, will fall further. The program will have a positive impact on the poor by (i) helping \nfarmers increase their yield and incomes, (ii) providing support to industries that are most affected \nby the pandemic with the proviso of maintaining employment levels, and (iii) creating a small \nemployment program targeting women and youth. \n43.  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It includes several \nproactive actions across all three outputs to support women with the immediate and medium-term \nimpacts of COVID-19. The health response to COVID-19 ensures that (i) 150 frontline health \nworkers (nurses and doctors), of whom 50% are women, will be trained on COVID-19 protocols \nand provided with appropriate personal protective equipment; 31 (ii) at least 750 women will be \ntrained  as  public  health  advocates  to  support  gender-responsive  COVID-19  public  health \nmessages across all provinces; (iii) GBV referral pathways are incorporated into health planning; \nand (iv) COVID-19 health facilities are safe and accessible for women and vulnerable populations.  \n \n44.  In addition, socioeconomic impacts on women will be addressed in several ways. First, to \naddress issues relating to reduction or loss of income should a COVID-19 outbreak occur, food \nrations will be distributed to 100,000 households throughout the country, including to about 10,000 \nhouseholds headed by women. Second, capital injections into SOEs that commit to retaining staff \nwill benefit women, who make up a large proportion of workers in companies such as SolTuna \n(56% of the workforce) and Solomon Airlines (36%). Third, women will be contracted to monitor \nprices, which will increase their income and ensure prices are affordable. Fourth, an agricultural \nsupport  program  will  be  developed,  which  will  include  support  to  women  farmers. \nThe development of the support will be informed by gender analysis and proactive measures will \nbe taken to set targets to ensure women farmers benefit. Fifth, the Development Bank of Solomon \nIslands will be provided with funds to make loans to MSMEs, including those owned by women. \nSixth, measures will be introduced to prevent and respond to GBV, including nationwide radio \npublic awareness campaigns on GBV and COVID-19, and the development of COVID-19 referral \npathways and COVID-19 telephone GBV services in all provinces. Service providers will have \nplans in place that will allow them to continue to provide services if COVID-19 cases are \nconfirmed. Finally, the Protection Committee and GBV subcommittee have been activated and \nare ensuring that gender issues and support for the rights of vulnerable populations are being \nconsidered across COVID-19 preparedness and response activities. This committee has been \nallocated funding of SI$2.3 million ($0.3 million). The gender activities and outcomes of the \nprogram will be monitored using a gender monitoring matrix.32 \n \n \n30 Joelle Albert et al. 2020.

Adverse Impact of  There has been a sharp decline in growth and revenue forecasts for 2020 \nExogenous Shocks  as a result of the pandemic. The final magnitude of the economic losses will \ndepend on how the outbreak evolves in both Solomon Islands and the rest \nof the world. For the past 5 years, growth in Solomon Islands has averaged \n2.5% of GDP. With the onset of the pandemic, growth is projected to \ncontract from between 0.2% and 12.3%. The wide range of projections \nreflect when the forecasts were made, the assumptions on trading partner \ngrowth, particularly the People\u2019s Republic of China, how long borders will \nstay closed in Solomon Islands and key neighbors like Australia and New \nZealand, and the underlying fragilities in the economy. The fiscal deficit is \nprojected to increase from 2.7% of GDP in 2019 to 7.3% of GDP in 2020. \nGovernment external public debt is projected to increase from 10.1% of \nGDP to 17.8% in 2020. The current account deficit will increase by 6.4 \npercentage points to 15% of GDP in 2020. Poverty, as measured by the \ninternational poverty line of $1.90 per day, is expected to increase from \n23.6%  of  the  population  in  2018  to  27.5%  in  2020.  The  economic \ndeterioration is a result of three primary causes: (i) lower exports, which are \nconcentrated  in  logging,  agriculture,  and  tourism;  (ii)  significant \ninfrastructure projects are stalled as skilled labor and raw materials cannot \nbe imported; and (iii) falling remittances as additional workers cannot travel \nto the key Australian and New Zealand markets.  \n2.  Countercyclical  The government has approved a SI$446 million ($54 million) countercyclical \nDevelopment  development program to respond to the crisis consisting of two major \nExpenditures  components. The first component, costed at SI$137 million ($16.5 million), \nis  for  implementing  the  COVID-19  Preparedness  and  Response  Plan \nfocused on preventing the virus from entering the country and getting the \ncountry  ready  if  the  virus  enters,  particularly  the  health  sector.  The \npreparedness and response plan contains an initial SI$27 million ($2.5 \nmillion) for health, social protection measures including food rations for the \nentire population for a month, increased gender-based violence measures, \nand  more  supplies  to  schools  such  as  hand  sanitizer.  The  second \ncomponent,  costed  at  SI$309  million  ($37.5  million),  is  an  Economic \nStimulus  Package.  The  Economic  Stimulus  Package  includes  social \nprotection measures through support for farmers; the forestry, fisheries, and \ntourism sectors; grants to churches, provincial authorities, and schools; and \ncontracting women and youth to monitor prices. There is rental relief and \nmore credit through the development bank for micro, small, and medium \nenterprises,  equity  injections  in  state-owned  enterprises,  and  bringing \nforward  infrastructure  projects.  The  Economic  Stimulus  Package  also \nprovides each Solomon Islands National Provident Fund member the ability \nto access SI$5,000. Banks are deferring loan repayments. Power tariffs and \nPort Authority charges have been reduced. And the furloughed public \nservants will continue to receive full pay. \n3.  Pre-shock Record  The government has a pre-shock record of generally sound macroeconomic \nof Generally Sound  management, with low deficits. Economic growth was respectable at 3.9% \nMacroeconomic  and 2.7% in 2018 and 2019, respectively. This was driven by strong \nManagement  performance  in  logging,  infrastructure,  fisheries,  agriculture,  and \nmanufacturing. Inflation was low at 1.9% in 2019. There was a fiscal surplus \nof 0.7% of GDP in 2018, but the fiscal deficit was manageable at 2.7% of \n ", "  Appendix 4  21 \nAccess Criterion  Asian Development Bank Assessment \nGDP in 2019. Although the current account deficit was 6.4% in 2019, there \nwere plenty of official reserves, with over 8 months of import cover. Public \nexternal debt levels were low\u2014rising from 7.5% of GDP in 2015 to 10.1% of \nGDP in 2019\u2014but were projected to double to 21.7% of GDP in 2024, which \nis driven by the government\u2019s comprehensive infrastructure investment \nprogram, which would positively impact growth, particularly in rural areas. \n4.  Structural Reforms  Solomon Islands has zero COVID-19 cases. With a fragile health system \n(including Health  which would quickly be overwhelmed if the virus arrived and spread rapidly, \nResponse)  the government implemented strong measures to prevent entry of the virus \nand prepare the country, particularly the health system, for an outbreak. A \nState of Emergency was declared on 25 March 2020 and extended by \nParliament for 4 months to 25 July 2020. International passenger flights \nwere suspended on 27 March. On 26 February 2020, the government \napproved the COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan which aims to \nminimize the risk of importing COVID-19 to Solomon Islands, limit the \nspread and impact of the disease if it enters the country, and reduce societal \ndisruption and social impacts of the pandemic. An initial SI$27 million ($2.5 \nmillion) has been allocated to the health response. Hospitals are being \nupgraded, particularly isolation units which could be used as intensive care \nunits; medical personnel are being trained on infectious disease issues; \ntesting  equipment  and  medical  supplies  are  being  procured;  public \nawareness campaigns are underway. Development partners have provided \nfunding to supplement the government\u2019s efforts. \n5.  Debt Sustainability  As result of the crisis, the public debt\u2013GDP ratio is now expected to increase \nfrom 10.1% of GDP in 2019 to 17.8% of GDP in 2020 and 31.8% of GDP in \n2024.  Persistent  budget  imbalances  and  an  ambitious  infrastructure \nconstruction program are expected to continue exerting significant upward \npressure on the debt\u2013GDP ratio, even after the impacts of the pandemic \nhave  faded  and  economic  growth  has  recovered.  Debt  granted  on \nconcessional  terms  constitutes  80%  of  total  debt,  with  ADB  and  the \nInternational Development Association as the major creditors. The high \ndegree  of  concessional  lending  keeps  borrowing  costs  low.  Debt \nsustainability  analyses  conducted  by  ADB  and  the  IMF  conclude  that \nSolomon Islands\u2019 public debt remains sustainable despite its rising trend and \nboth with or without the $10 million loan from this program. \n6.  Coordination with  ADB and the IMF collaborate closely on policy issues in Solomon Islands. \nthe IMF  ADB has participated in IMF Article IV missions. The two organizations \nrecently agreed to support the government in preparing a medium-term \nrevenue strategy. During COVID-19, ADB and the IMF have had regular \nbilateral  meetings  on  macro  and  fiscal  issues,  and  as  part  of  wider \ndevelopment partner discussions on supporting the government during this \ncrisis. ADB, as lead development partner supporting the government in \npreparing the economic stimulus package, actively engaged with the IMF on \nthe design of the package to ensure their policy advice was reflected in the \nfinal document. The IMF approved a $28.8 million program on 1 June 2020, \nto be financed from its Rapid Credit Facility and Rapid Financing Instrument. \nADB and IMF have discussed joint monitoring arrangements from our \nrespective programs where feasible. The latest IMF Article IV report was \nmade public in February 2020 and an IMF Assessment Letter was received \non 20 April 2020.  \nADB = Asian Development Bank, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product, IMF = International \nMonetary Fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank staff. \n "], "metadata": {"ADBContentGroup": "84;#SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b", "ADBCountry": "39;#Solomon Islands|e95dea21-3f95-49c3-a4fd-555080da4c9e", "ADBCountryDocumentType": "", "ADBDepartmentOwner": "83;#SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b", "ADBDivision": "31;#PLCO|609583a2-78a9-4781-823e-db1ffb65c55d", "ADBDocumentLanguage": "3;#English|16ac8743-31bb-43f8-9a73-533a041667d6", "ADBDocumentSecurity": "", "ADBDocumentType": "6;#Templates|c97063a1-ad03-4324-beaa-bf7c225b0bba", "ADBDocumentTypeValue": "ADB Document", "ADBFocusArea": "", "ADBProject": "121;#54178-001 : Rapid Fiscal Stimulus Program|935de850-e742-4daf-8af2-b3ac45008b52", "ADBProjectDocumentType": "", "ADBSector": "", "Author": "Asian Development Bank", "AuthorIds_UIVersion_1536": "110", "AuthorIds_UIVersion_2048": "109", "Comments": "", "Company": "Licenced User", "ContentTypeId": "0x010100A3BFD338C4D69F46BE33AA49AB50870100E100252EC4D55742A4A16BD1F24A5558", "CreationDate": "D:20200617073235+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 17 for Word", "Keywords": "solomon islands, covid-19, coronavirus, covid-19 response, pandemic, medical supplies, emerging disease, public health, 54174-001, loan 3922, adb projects, terms and conditions, board approval, rrp, approved projects, recommendations of the president", "ModDate": "D:20200625105040+08'00'", "Producer": "Adobe PDF Library 15.0", "Segment": "", "SourceModified": "D:20200616233145", "Subject": "The program will help the Government of Solomon Islands implement its countercyclical public expenditure program, comprising its COVID-19 Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP) and the Economic Stimulus Package (ESP) to address the impacts of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe report and recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors (RRP) document describes the terms and conditions of a project for consideration and approval by ADB's Board of Directors.\n\nThis document dated June 2020 is provided for the ADB project 54178-001 in Solomon Islands.", "TaxCatchAll": "6;#Templates|c97063a1-ad03-4324-beaa-bf7c225b0bba;#4;#SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b;#3;#SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b;#1;#English|16ac8743-31bb-43f8-9a73-533a041667d6", "Title": "COVID-19 Rapid Response Program: Report and Recommendation of the President", "a0d1b14b197747dfafc19f70ff45d4f6": "", "a37ff23a602146d4934a49238d370ca5": "Templates|c97063a1-ad03-4324-beaa-bf7c225b0bba", "d01a0ce1b141461dbfb235a3ab729a2c": "", "d61536b25a8a4fedb48bb564279be82a": "SEC|0251849c-5d26-4413-ade9-2e3ee268b27b", "de77c5b4d20d4bdeb0b6d09350193e53": "", "h00e4aaaf4624e24a7df7f06faa038c6": "English|16ac8743-31bb-43f8-9a73-533a041667d6", "hca2169e3b0945318411f30479ba40c8": "", "ia017ac09b1942648b563fe0b2b14d52": "PLCO|609583a2-78a9-4781-823e-db1ffb65c55d", "k985dbdc596c44d7acaf8184f33920f0": "", "p030e467f78f45b4ae8f7e2c17ea4d82": ""}, "author_page": " \nVice-President  Ahmed M.
