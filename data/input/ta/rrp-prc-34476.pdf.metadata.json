An environmental impact assessment was undertaken, and \nAssessment  the summary environmental impact assessment was circulated to the \nBoard on 30 April 2003. \n \nProject  The Project is located in Gansu Province and involves the construction of \nDescription  the 98-megawatt (MW) run-of-river Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant (XHP) \nby  the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower  Company  (XHC);  upgrading  power \nsupply to three poor townships (Xishui, Huazhai, and Anyang) for more \nreliable electricity directly from XHP; and institutional strengthening of the \nproject implementing agency.  \n \nRationale  Coal-fired thermal power plants are the main source of energy in Gansu \nProvince, a poor inland western province. The capital, Lanzhou, has \nfrequently been cited as one of the cities with the worst air pollution in the \nPRC, mainly arising from coal combustion and desertification. Gansu is in \nthe process of developing several needed clean energy development \ninitiatives,  covering  a  spectrum  of  renewable  energy  technologies. \nHowever,  clean  energy  production  is  unevenly  distributed  and  faces \nmany challenges in Gansu. \n \nZhangye City is a poor area of Gansu with a deficient energy supply. Of \nZhangye City\u2019s 1.25 million population, almost 80% are classified as rural. \nOf its rural population, 293,000 or about 23% have incomes less than the \nprovincial rural poverty line. Using the lower range of provincial estimates, \n17,000 persons in Zhangye City can be classified as urban poor. Located \nabout 600 kilometers northwest from the provincial capital of Lanzhou, \nthe City experiences frequent interruptions and shortages in electricity \nsupply. The Zhangye City electric network is part of the Hexi corridor \nnetwork,  which  in  turn  is  part  of  the  Gansu  and  Northwest  power \nnetworks.  \n \nThe installed capacity in Zhangye City and in the Hexi grid is too small to \nmeet the current peak load demand and most of the power stations are \nsmall. In 2001, the Zhangye network experienced load-shedding of 1,975 \nhours,  equivalent  to  3.2  gigawatt-hours  (GWh)  of  unserved  energy \ndemand. The current installed capacity in Zhangye City is approximately \n94.5 MW, whereas peak demand is almost 200 MW. The Hexi corridor \ngrid  has  installed  capacity  of  475 MW  against  its  peak  demand  of \n850 MW.  Zhangye  City  is  importing  more  than  80%  of  its  electricity \ndemand of about 900 GWh from the Hexi corridor network. The power \nsituation in Zhangye City is expected to become worse as projected \nelectricity  demand  is  increasing  but  no  new  generating  plants  are \nexpected to become operational until 2006. The power shortage is a key ", "iv   \nexpected to become operational until 2006. The power shortage is a key \nfactor inhibiting economic development of the area.  \n \nBoth short-term and long-term forecast methods were used to assess the \ndemand projections. Five initial alternatives using three power generation \ntechnologies\u2014hydropower,  coal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired\u2014were \npreliminarily considered  for  selecting  viable  electricity  generation.  The \nGeneration Expansion System Planning (GESP) II model was used to identify \nthe least-cost alternative option from the list of feasible alternatives.  The \nGESP II model identified the 98 MW XHP as the least-cost alternative for \ngeneration expansion in Gansu Province. \n \nHydropower development can  increase power generation, improve  the \nefficiency  and  reliability  of  supply  of  electric  power,  and  improve \nenvironmental quality. These will directly and indirectly reduce poverty \nand accelerate economic growth. The Project is consistent with the 10th \nFive-Year Plan, which calls for clean energy development, energy sector \nrestructuring, and  with the Government\u2019s plan to accelerate economic \ndevelopment in Zhangye City by providing reliable electricity supply to \nlocal  agriculture  and  cottage  industries,  and  to  reinforce  the  power \navailability and reliability in the electricity grid. \n \nObjectives and  The  main  objective  of  the  Project  is  to  contribute  to  environmental \nScope  improvement in Zhangye City through provision of improved access to \nclean energy. The Project consists mainly of: (i) XHP, a 98 MW run-of-\nriver  hydropower  plant,  (ii)  rural  electrification,  and  (iii)  institutional \nstrengthening.  \n \nCost Estimates  The total project cost is estimated at $87.0 million equivalent, comprising \na foreign exchange cost of $35.0 million (40%) and a local currency cost \nof $52.0 million equivalent (60%). \n \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $35 million (100% of foreign \nexchange  cost)  from  the  ordinary  capital  resources  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  finance  the  Project.  The  local  cost \namounting to $52 million equivalent will be financed through a loan from \ndomestic  commercial  banks  and  equity  from  Hei  He  Hydropower \nDevelopment Company, Zhangye Water and Power Bureau, and Gansu \nYinlong Construction Corporation.  \n \nLoan Amount and  The loan will have a 24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an \nTerms  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per \nannum, and a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be capitalized in the \nloan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan \nand Project Agreements.  \n \nAllocation and  The Borrower of the ADB loan will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be \nRelending Terms  re-lent from the Ministry of Finance to the Gansu Provincial Government \n(GPG) and then to the Zhangye City Government (ZCG). ZCG will relend \nloan proceeds ($35 million) to XHC, through an on lending agreement \nwith the same terms and conditions as those of the loan. The foreign ", "  v\nwith the same terms and conditions as those of the loan. The foreign \nexchange and interest rate variation risks of the loan will be borne by \nXHC.  \n \nPeriod of  Until 30 April 2008 \nUtilization   \n \nEstimated Project  31 October 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  GPG  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  responsible  for  the  overall \nArrangements  implementation of the Project. XHC will be the implementing agency to \ncoordinate  and  monitor  all  construction  activities  of  XHP.  A  project \nimplementation  unit  at  XHC  will facilitate land acquisition,  social, and \nenvironmental protection measures, and ensure that local concerns are \nadequately addressed. \n \nExecuting Agency  Gansu Provincial Government \n \nProcurement  Equipment, materials, and services financed from the proceeds of the \nADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. Items financed with local currency funds will be procured \nfollowing  local  competitive  bidding  acceptable  to  ADB.  Advance \nprocurement action and retroactive financing has been approved by ADB \nin principle.  \n \nConsulting  International and domestic consultants financed under the loan will be \nServices  recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \nThe Project will provide 29 person-months of international consultants of \nwhich 15 person-months are for supervision of civil works, 8 person-\nmonths for supervision of installation, 2 person-months for environmental \nmonitoring, 2 person-months for financial management, and 2 person-\nmonths for institutional strengthening. \n \nAbout 820 person-months of  domestic consultants will be  required for \nXHC and will be funded by domestic financing. Domestic consultants will \nbe  recruited  using  either  ADB recruitment procedures or government \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. XHC will establish about three resident \nsupervision engineer offices for construction supervision, environmental \nmonitoring,  socioeconomic  and  poverty  monitoring,  and  project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. \n \nProject Benefits  The  Project  will  improve  the  efficiency  and  reliability  of  electricity \nand Beneficiaries  provision through the run-of-river XHP. XHP will have significant positive \nenvironmental impacts in terms of air pollution avoided from alternative \nenergy sources. The system planning and least-cost analysis show that \nthe  alternative  is  a  109 MW  coal-fired  power  plant.  Based  on  this \nalternative, the avoided emissions were estimated at a yearly average of \n240 tons, 1,910 tons, 1,500 tons, and 366,000 tons of particulate matter, \nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide, respectively. There \nare almost no trees and shrubs on the mountains along the river section, \nwith thin soil layers on top of riverside mountains not suitable for grazing, ", "vi   \nwith thin soil layers on top of riverside mountains not suitable for grazing, \ngrass vegetation is only 15% in the XHP site, no threatened species of \nwildlife, and few residential settlements, Project impacts will be minimal. \nProper construction; rational reuse and disposal of excavated soil and \nrock; proper treatment of wastewater during project construction; and \nrestoration of construction sites, temporarily occupied land, gravel mining \nand  washing  sites,  and  waste  rock  sites,  will  mitigate  adverse \nenvironmental impacts. \n \nXHP construction is expected to generate peak employment of 3,000 \npeople. During the operation and maintenance of the power plant, about \n100 permanent staff will be employed. Improvement of the service roads \nfrom the present dirt track to an all-season road will reduce travel time to \nmarket  and  improve  access  to  education  and  medical  services  for \nisolated  households  served  by  this  road.  The  rural  electrification \ncomponent can provide reliable electricity supply for three townships with \na total population of 24,037, of whom 22,193 or 92.3% are poor, and will \nencourage new small and medium enterprises that would increase output \nand employment.  \n \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is 7.5%, which is \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital of 4.5%. The economic \ninternal rate of return (EIRR) is 23.4%. Sensitivity tests show that both the \nFIRR  and  EIRR  will  be  able  to  withstand  reasonable  changes  in \nassumptions. \n \nRisks and  XHP will have several types of risks, including geotechnical, hydrological, \nAssumptions  and financial risks. XHC is aware of these risks and adequate steps are \nbeing taken to avoid or minimize them. It has obtained a license to use \nthe river for the operations of XHP. Additional intangible risks exist due to \nthe ongoing restructuring of the power sector.  \n \nSensitivity  analysis  has  been  conducted  to  investigate  the  effects  of \nchanges in key variables on the financial and economic viability of XHC, \ncompared with the base case. Only adverse changes are considered. \nBoth financial and economic indicators remain robust despite simulated \nadverse conditions. Risk analyses have also been performed using a \nprobabilistic  approach  to  the  perceived  risk  factors  that  affect  the \neconomic  viability  of  XHC.  Based  on  the  weighted  average  of  all \nsimulated combinations, the expected  EIRR is well within acceptable \nlevels. \n \n \n ", " ", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  to  you  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a \nproposed  loan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Gansu  Clean  Energy \nDevelopment Project. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  Economic and social development in PRC has been rapid in the last two decades. The \nPRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) per capita was $964 (in 2002 values), life expectancy at \nbirth is 70.1 years, and adult literacy is 83%. Government programs have resulted in poverty \nreduction, particularly in rural areas. Using the official rural poverty line of CNY947 per capita, \nthe PRC\u2019s rural poor represents 4.6% of the rural population. Studies estimate urban poverty in \nthe PRC at 4.7%. \n \n3.  Economic  growth  has  been  facilitated  by  infrastructure  development,  a  crucial \ncomponent being energy sector development. At the end of 2002,  the PRC\u2019s total installed \npower was 350 gigawatts (GW). By 2010, it is estimated that total installed capacity will reach \n450 GW. The PRC's electricity is generated overwhelmingly by coal (about 75%). Coal use in \nthe  PRC  entails  high  transport  costs  and  is  characterized  by  low  utilization  efficiency. \nHydroelectricity ranks a distant second (about 20%), followed by oil, gas, and nuclear power, \nwhich account for the remaining 5%. Appendix 2 gives a summary analysis for the energy \nsector.  \n \n4.  The  heavy  dependence  on  coal  as  an  energy  source  has  resulted  in  substantial \nenvironmental damage due to pollution. The adverse impacts of environmental pollution have \nbeen acknowledged to disproportionately affect the poor. Poorer households typically rely on \nraw coal and biomass (e.g., wood and animal dung) for cooking and heating, and suffer \naccordingly from indoor air pollution. High pollution loads and energy intensity would be reduced \nif there were a more pronounced shift toward clean energy, energy efficiency, and greenhouse \ngas abatement.  \n \n5.   Coal-fired thermal power plants are the main source of energy in Gansu province; \nhowever, hydropower accounted for 41% of power generation in  2000. Gansu is developing \nseveral clean energy development initiatives, covering a wide spectrum of renewable energy \ntechnologies. Installed wind generating capacity is 8 megawatts (MW). Residential solar water \nheaters are becoming more common. Solar photovoltaic and battery systems are used in some \nremote, off-grid areas as source of power for small appliances (e.g., radio and television).1 \nBiomass-to-biogas is another potential source of clean energy for agricultural areas. Different \ntechnologies have regional applications within the Province, with solar and wind appearing more \npromising in the western areas, and greater hydropower potential in the southeastern areas. \nSeveral small and medium-scale hydropower projects have been commissioned in the region of \nthe Project, with several more planned for development. However, clean energy production is \nunevenly distributed in Gansu. The capital, Lanzhou, has frequently been cited as one of the \ncities  with  the  worst  air  pollution  in  the  PRC,  mainly  arising  from  coal  combustion  and \ndesertification. \n                                                 \n1  The national solar energy research center is located in Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province. ", "2  \n6.  During  the  2001  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  PRC  Government  requested \nassistance for hydropower and clean energy development in Gansu province. In response to \nthis  request,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  September  2001  provided  technical \nassistance (TA) to explore the need for policy and institutional reforms for hydropower and clean \nenergy development, and to examine the feasibility of investment programs as the basis for a \nproject in Zhangye City that could be supported by ADB.2 The TA\u2019s draft final report was \nsubmitted to ADB and the Government in December 2002. An ADB loan Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited the PRC in January 2003 and a Memorandum of Understanding for appraisal was \nendorsed by the Government on 28 September 2003. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Zhangye City3 is a poor area of Gansu with a deficient energy supply. It used to be a \nmajor trade center of the famous ancient Silk Road. Of Zhangye City\u2019s 1.25 million population, \nalmost 80% are classified as rural. Of its rural population, 293,000 or about 23% have incomes \nless than the provincial rural poverty line. Using the lower range of provincial estimates it is \nestimated that 17,000 can be classified as urban poor in Zhangye City. A summary of Zhangye \nCity\u2019s approach to poverty reduction is given in Supplementary Appendix A, and a summary of \nthe public consultation process is given in Supplementary Appendix B. Located about 600 \nkilometers (km) northwest  of the provincial capital of Lanzhou (Map 1), the  city experiences \nfrequent interruptions and shortages in electricity supply. The Zhangye City electric network is \npart of the Hexi corridor network, which in turn is part of the Gansu and Northwest power \nnetworks (Map 2).  \n \n8.  Electricity demand in the Northwest network is expected to grow at 7% and 6.4% in the \n10th and 11th Five-Year planning periods (2001\u20132005 and 2006\u20132010), respectively. Similarly, \nenergy demand growth in Gansu province is expected to be 6.0% and 5.7% for the same \nperiod. The installed capacity in Zhangye City and in the Hexi grid is too small to meet the \ncurrent peak load demand and most of the power stations are small. In 2001, the Zhangye \nnetwork experienced load-shedding of 1,975 hours. The current installed capacity in Zhangye \nCity is approximately 94.5 MW4 whereas peak demand is almost 200 MW. The Hexi corridor \ngrid has an installed capacity of 475 MW against its peak demand of 850 MW. Zhangye City is \nimporting more  than 80% of its electricity demand of about 900 GWh from the Hexi corridor \nnetwork.  \n \n9.   The Xiliushui and Xiaogushan hydropower plants are the two proposed hydropower \nstations on the Heihe river expected to start producing power around 2006 to 2007. The \nZhangye City network has two comparable but distinct peak demand scenarios, winter and \nsummer. The summer peak imposes maximum demand on the existing network. The summer \ndemand is made up of a larger peak mainly due to the agricultural (pumped irrigation) load. \nHydropower can provide maximum generation during summer months and is particularly suited \nto alleviate the peak electricity demand gaps in summer for the Zhangye  City network. The \nexpected energy balances excluding the import from Hexi Corridor Grid in 2005, 2006, and \n2010 are -1,015 gigawatt-hours (GWh), -628 GWh, and \u2013914 (GWh), respectively. The power \nsituation  in  Zhangye  City is expected to become worse as projected electricity demand is \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to People\u2019s Republic of China for Gansu Hydropower Development. Manila. \n3  Zhangye until 2002 was designated as a prefecture with five counties and one city. With the change in status from \nprefecture to city, the former City area has been redesignated as Ganzhou district. \n4  This includes 8.5 MW of coal-fired capacity in Ganzhou district, which operates only on an intermittent basis; \n52 MW at the Longshou phase I hydropower station; and approximately 34 MW of mini-hydro at the Longqui \nstations 1, 2, 3, and 4, and other small hydropower stations. ", "  3\nincreasing but no new generating plants are expected to become operational until 2006. The \npower shortage is a key factor inhibiting economic development in the area. \n \n10.  The  98 MW  Xiaogushan  hydropower  plant  (XHP)  is  the  least-cost  alternative  for \ngeneration expansion in Gansu province. XHP will represent about 38% of the installed capacity \nin the Zhangye grid and, in the short term, it is likely to dominate the local generation scene in \nterms of ancillary services, peak load, and base-load management. With only 98 MW installed \ncapacity, however, it will not be able to influence the electricity generation tariffs in the electricity \nmarket.  To  ensure  the  ongoing  financial  viability  of  the  operations  of  the  Xiaogushan \nHydropower Company (XHC) in the future, it is necessary to ensure that the overall operation of \nXHC is competitive and  that its management is well equipped to maximize the value of its \nnatural advantages\u2014lower transmission losses as it is close to the local load center and overall \nlow-cost operation as a small run-of-river hydropower station. XHC and the Gansu provincial \ngovernment  (GPG)  need  to  ensure  that  the  framework  for  competition  and  regulation  is \neffective, transparent, and predictable. This is to ensure a free and fair competitive market for \ngeneration in the province. \n \n11.  The development of clean energy is consistent with the PRC Government\u2019s 10th Five-\nYear Plan, which calls for energy sector restructuring. The plan\u2019s target is to decrease the \nproportion  of  energy  from  coal  by  3.9%  and  increase  energy  from  natural  gas  and \nhydroelectricity  by  5.6%  in  2005.5  Gansu  province  has  actively  promoted  development  of \nalternatives to coal-fired power, and has achieved a high rate of hydropower development in \nZhangye City (91% of installed capacity). A review of the clean energy subsector, and key \ninstitutional reforms and power sector restructuring activities are found in the energy sector \nanalysis (Appendix 2).  The PRC\u2019s achievements in energy conservation and environmental \nimprovement have also been substantial.  \n \n12.  The development of clean energy resulting in increased energy generation and in more \nreliable and efficient energy service contributes to poverty reduction. Poverty reduction in \nZhangye  City  is  governed by the strategy put forward in the \u201cOverall Program of Poverty \nReduction and Development in Gansu Province (2001\u20132010)\u201d, developed by the  provincial \ngovernment. The plan identifies the extreme natural conditions, poor infrastructure, and low \nlevels of human capital as the causes of continued poverty in the Province. Hence the areas of \nfocus  are:  infrastructure  development  particularly  rural  roads,  electricity  supply,  and \ncommunications;  increased  agricultural  productivity  focused  on  irrigation  improvement; \nenvironmental  protection,  rehabilitation,  and  improvement  of  existing  infrastructure;  and \nimprovement of the delivery of social services. \n \nC.  Lessons Learned \n \n13.  Of 11 public power sector projects financed by ADB in  the PRC, four  have been \ncompleted.  Project  completion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  assess  the  four  as \ngenerally successful and indicate that these were smoothly implemented. Lessons from ADB\u2019s \nactivities in the PRC point to: (i) the need to improve financial reporting; (ii) the need for more \nattention  to  environmental  matters;  (iii) the  advisability  of  using  larger  boiler-turbine  units; \n(iv) the need for rigorous screening to ensure that projects are in line with ADB\u2019s energy policy; \n(v) the  possibility  of  delay  for  complex  and  multicomponent  projects  involving  several \n                                                 \n5  Hydropower potential in the PRC is one of the largest in the world. Estimates by the Government (Ministry of Water \nResources) place current hydropower resource use at 10\u201320% of potential. In comparison, utilization of available \nhydropower is typically at 50\u201390% in developed countries. This shows that the potential for expansion is large. ", "4  \nimplementing agencies and multiple approval processes; (vi) the need for greater efforts to \nimplement policy-related covenants; and (vii) the importance of capacity building. A discussion \non external assistance is summarized in Appendix 3 and details are provided in Supplementary \nAppendix C.  \n \n14.  Power utilities have been weak in the area of commercial and financial management. \nOften, there is a need for institutional strengthening in the areas of organizational structure, \ndelegation of authority, management information and control systems, accounting and financial \nmanagement, and personnel development and training. Recently, some ongoing PRC power \nprojects have experienced implementation delays in meeting procurement and construction \ndeadlines.  These  are  mainly  due  to  the  ongoing  restructuring  of  the  power  sector  and \nconsequent change in the \u201cownership\u201d of the projects. \n \n15.  ADB reviewed and evaluated the cost-recovery performance of the power sector in \n14 developing member countries (DMCs), and reviewed the record of financial covenants by 42 \npower  utilities.6  Through  three  key  criteria\u2014cost  minimization,  tariff  setting,  and  collection \nefficiency\u2014the PRC was one of three DMCs that were assessed as having the highest level of \nsatisfactory performance. Among the lessons in the review of compliance levels, the need to \nassist  DMCs  to  create  new  institutions  with  a  more  business-like  approach  to  utility \nmanagement was noted. ABD support should continue for new, unbundled utilities that have \nadopted a more transparent, commercial, and independent approach. \n \n16.  The  above  lessons  have  been  taken  into  account  in  designing  the  Project.  A \ncomprehensive  feasibility  study  was  prepared  during  the  study  process,  and  project \nimplementation issues were given special emphasis. Consulting services will be provided to \nassist in project implementation, and institutions involved will be strengthened to improve overall \nand financial management capabilities, and to ensure sustainability. Local currency financing \nwas structured to ensure an appropriate mix of debt and government equity. Provision was \nmade  for  sufficient  working  capital,  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  financial  and  economic \nperformance was undertaken. Conservative cost contingencies have been used to avoid loan \nsurpluses. Technical aspects were carefully reviewed and project alternatives were examined \nprudently. Project design has carefully considered environmental and social aspects and has \nensured that the Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s energy and environment policies.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n17.  The main objective of the Project is to contribute to environmental improvement in \nZhangye City through provision of improved access to clean energy. The Project targets the \nHexi grid in terms of electricity provision, and the townships of Xishui, Huazhai, and Anyang for \nrural electrification. The Project also aims to provide support for institutional strengthening in \nimplementing  agency  (IA).  The  Project  is  located  in  Gansu  province  and  comprises  the \nconstruction of a 98 MW run-of-river XHP by XHC; upgrading power supply to three poor \ntownships for more reliable electricity directly from XHP; and institutional strengthening of the \nIA. \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2003. Special Evaluation Study of Cost Recovery in the Power Sector. Manila. ", "  5\nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n18.  The proposed Project components are as follows. \n \n1.  Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant (98 MW) \n \n19.  The XHP component includes all necessary civil works and equipment to complete the \n98 MW facility (2 x 40 MW plus 1 x 18 MW) and connect it to a 110 kilovolt (kV) intermediate (or \nservice) substation.  This  interconnection  point  is  assumed  to  be  the  \u201cpoint  of  sale\u201d.  XHP \ncomprises the following subcomponents: (i) civil works, (ii) service road improvement, (iii) power \nplant  equipment,  (iv)  hydro-mechanical  equipment  and  metal  structures,  (v)  environmental \nmanagement, (vi) construction utilities, (vii) transmission lines  (27 km) to the 110 kV substation \nto be constructed adjacent to the downstream Longshou phase II project, and (viii) design and \nsupervision. XHP is a key energy development project in the 10th Five-Year Plan of Zhangye \nCity, and is consistent with continued sustainable growth of the renewable energy subsector. \nMore details of run-off-river power plant is provided in Supplementary Appendix D. \n \n2.  Rural Electrification \n \n20.  This component includes construction of a 35 kV line in association with XHP, and a \n35 kV line to transmit electricity after the completion of the Project to Xishui, Huazhai and \nAnyang townships. A majority of the people living in these townships are considered to be poor \nand they will receive more reliable electricity directly from XHP. \n \n3.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n21.  Institutional strengthening has been included as a separate component for the Project. \nExtensive discussions with the Executing Agency (EA) and IA reflect the strong need for \nbuilding the capacity of the IA. It should be noted that XHC is a new project company created to \nundertake the development of the Project. Further, if the Project is approved, it will be the first \nADB-supported loan in Gansu province. In view of this,  it is envisaged that  the institutional \nstrengthening component will ensure that the IA will have sufficient capacity to implement the \nProject. The component is also designed to bring sustainable benefits which will improve the \nmanagement of XHC for increased efficiency. \n \n22.  Central  to  the  institutional  strengthening  effort  is  support  for  project  management, \nprocurement  and  contract  supervision,  financial  management,  enterprise  reforms  and \ngovernance,  human  resources  development,  performance  management,  environmental \nmonitoring, and energy efficiency improvement activities. The Project will provide training and \nconsulting services in these areas. Both local and foreign training programs will be developed \nfor  skills  development.  Beyond  training,  consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  aide  the \nimprovement  of  XHC,  and  project  design  has  incorporated  elements  that  will  support \ninstitutional  strengthening.  For  example,  the  development  of  a  financial  management \ninformation system is included in the institutional  strengthening component to improve the \nfinancial management and enterprise governance of XHC. To complement this, XHC is required \nto  update  its  chart  of  accounts  to  include  subaccounts  for  department/branch  or \nproject/subproject;  introduce  an  annual  company-wide  business  planning  and  budgeting \nprocess; introduce a system of project budgeting and costing; introduce a monthly financial \nreporting and review process;  and create post descriptions for all existing and new financial \ndepartment positions. \n ", "6  \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Potential Benefits from Clean Development Mechanism \n \n23.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  had  extensive  dialogue  with  the  Government,  which \nencouraged the expansion of the environmental aspect of the Project. The Mission explained \nthe  processing  requirements  for  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM)  activities  to  the \nGovernment (Appendix 4). Through discussions with the EA, the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and \nthe Ministry of Science and Technology, it was agreed to pursue tapping the CDM potential for \nXHC, and benefits could be channeled as seed resources to reduce poverty in the area. The \nProject is a viable CDM candidate, and based on current prices being offered for emissions \nreductions that are yet to be certified, potential revenues could meet about 10% of the total \nproject cost. If the Project were approved by the  United Nations Framework Convention on \nClimate Change CDM Executive Board, it would be one of the first ADB-funded efforts to assist \nin bringing certified emission reductions to the market. A web site (www.xhconline.com) was \ndeveloped to provide necessary information about the Project and potential for CDM activities. \n \n2.  Policy Dialogue \n \n24.  Environmental improvements related to clean energy is the strength of the Project. Over \ntime the Project was developed into a multicomponent effort that would result in beneficial \nimpacts to improve the environment while targeting the poor. The Zhangye City Government\u2019s \n(ZCG) involvement to improve the project area\u2019s overall development,  the environment, and \npoverty reduction plans, has strengthened the rationale for the Project. Various environmental \nimprovement  measures  such  as  closure  of  an  old  coal-fired  power  plant,  mechanisms  to \nharness CDM benefits, and energy conservation activities are included in the Project.  \n \n25.  GPG and ZCG requested ADB\u2019s TA support for the further promotion of its renewable \nenergy program. The requested TA aims to demonstrate: the potential for renewable energy \n(RE) commercialization, and the associated poverty reduction benefits of RE applications. The \nproposed TA can build on the experience of the Project, and has the potential to create self-\nsustaining  renewable  energy  service  providers  with  the  ability  to  design,  construct,  and \ncommission viable RE systems. It has been put forward that the proposed TA would consider \ndifferent forms of renewable energy (solar, wind, and biomass/biogas), consistent with the \noverall RE subsector activities in Gansu province. If approved, the proposed TA will benefit from \nprior work funded by ADB7 and will expand on the poverty reduction benefits from the Project so \nthat the further design of the proposed TA will not replicate, but be complementary to, the \nProject\u2019s impacts. \n \n3.  Maximizing the Project\u2019s Impacts on the Poor \n \n26.  Statistics in 2002 show that 269,452 of Zhangye\u2019s 983,206 rural people (27%) had \nannual per capita incomes below the Gansu province official rural poverty line of CNY1,100. \nThe Project area is located within Xishui township of Mati district in Sunan county. Mati is a poor \ndistrict with 3,766 people or 80% of its population under the provincial herder poverty line of \nCNY1,650 (Zhangye Poverty Reduction Bureau). Xishui township has a poverty incidence of \n93%. The rural electrification component has been designed to deliver power directly from XHC \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2002.

This component is estimated to result in \nsubstantial benefits to the poor  residents of the three townships, all of whom are existing \nelectricity consumers. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n27.  Project cost estimates are summarized in Table 1. The total project cost is $87 million \nequivalent, including physical and price contingencies, and interest and other charges during \nconstruction.

Financing Plan \n \n28.  The Government has requested a loan of $35 million (100% of the foreign exchange \ncost of the Project) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the Project. The loan will \nhave a 24-year term including a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offer  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5% (the fee will be capitalized \nin the loan), and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft Loan and Project \nAgreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made relying on any \ncommunication or advice from ADB.  \n ", "8  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nA.

The local cost amounting to $52 million equivalent will be financed through a loan from \ndomestic commercial banks and equity from  Hei  He  Hydropower  Development  Company \n(HHDC), Zhangye Water and Power Bureau, and Gansu Yinlong Construction Corporation. The \nBorrower of the ADB loan will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be re-lent from MOF to GPG \nand then to  ZCG.  ZCG  will  relend the loan proceeds to XHC, through an on-lending loan \nagreement with the same terms and conditions as those of the loan. The foreign exchange and \ninterest variation risks of the loan will be borne by XHC.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n30.  GPG will be the EA responsible for  the overall implementation of the Project.  HHDC \nestablished XHC in December 2001 for the development of the Project. The organization chart \nof XHC is found in Appendix 6. XHC will be the IA to coordinate and monitor all construction \nactivities  of  XHP.8  A  project  director,  directly  reporting  to  the  president  of  XHC,  will be \nresponsible for overall project management, approval of contracts, and payments. An XHC \nproject implementation unit established within XHC will facilitate land acquisition as well as \nsocial and environmental protection measures, and ensure that local concerns are adequately \naddressed.  The  unit  is  headed  by  an  XHC  project  manager  responsible  for  physical \nimplementation activities on a day-to-day basis and for the preparation of progress reports. The \npresent simple structure and dual responsibilities of the management staff of XHC is adequate \nfor current project preparation work but is insufficient for project implementation. Institutional \ncapacity needs to be developed. Assistance will be provided under consulting services in this \nrespect.  The  draft  project  administration  memorandum  (PAM)  is  given  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n31.  Preconstruction activities, such as detailed design, preparation of bidding documents, \ntendering and awarding of contracts, and construction of critical diversion tunnel works were \nstarted in mid-2003, and should be completed by February 2004.

", "  9\nelectrification construction work started in October 2003 and will take about 48 months, the \nanticipated completion date being 31 October 2007. The implementation schedule is attached in \nAppendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n32.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The civil \nworks for XHP is divided into 15 major packages9 to be procured under local competitive bidding \n(LCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. Equipment component is divided into 29 packages and \nprocured  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  and  international  shopping  (IS) \nprocedures (Appendix 8). Generally, for equipment more than $500,000 and civil works more \nthan $5 million, ICB is used. For equipment $500,000 and below, IS is applied, and for civil \nworks $5 million and below, LCB is applied. Ancillary facilities including administration building \nand service areas building under domestic financing will be procured using LCB  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Procurement for rural electrification under government financing will follow \nGovernment procedures acceptable to ADB. Procurement for rural electrification financed by \nADB will follow ADB procurement guidelines. ICB will be managed by a procurement agency, \nwhich is well qualified to perform these tasks and has previous experience in other externally \nfunded projects.  The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy  will be included  in all \ndocuments and contracts during bidding for and implementation of the Project. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n33.  International and domestic consultants financed under the loan will be recruited in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  Project  will  provide \n29 person-months of international consultants of which 15 are for supervision of civil works, \n8 are for supervision of installation, 2 are for environmental monitoring, 2 are for financial \nmanagement, and 2 are for institutional strengthening to be grouped under four packages \n(Appendix 9 and Supplementary Appendix F). Overall XHC project supervision will be under the \nresponsibility of the chief supervision engineer\u2019s (CSE) office. The CSE will be supported by two \ndeputy CSEs. One deputy CSE will be the team leader of the international consultants and will \nassist the CSE in project and contract management activities, and certify contractor\u2019s progress \npayments and contract variations prior to their approval by the CSE. \n \n34.  It is estimated that about 820 person-months of domestic consultants will be required for \nXHC and will be funded by domestic financing. Domestic consultants will be recruited either \nunder ADB recruitment procedures or under government procedures acceptable to ADB. XHC \nwill establish about  three resident supervision engineer offices for construction supervision, \nenvironmental monitoring,  and socioeconomic monitoring (6\u201310 person-months), and project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n35.  Except as the ADB may otherwise agree, the Borrower shall establish soon after the \nEffective Date, an imprest account at a bank acceptable to ADB. The imprest account shall be \nestablished,  managed,  replenished  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook dated January 2001, as amended from time to time, and detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the Borrower and ADB. The initial amount to be deposited \ninto the imprest account shall not exceed the equivalent of $800,000. \n                                                 \n9  In total there are 15 civil work packages, but only 14 will be financed by ADB.  ", "10  \n \n36.  The statement of expenditures (SOE) procedure may be used for reimbursement of \neligible expenditures and to liquidate advances provided into the imprest account, in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated January 2001, as amended from time to time, \nand  detailed  arrangements  agreed  upon  between  the  Borrower  and  ADB.  Any  individual \npayment  to  be  reimbursed  or  liquidated  under  the  SOE  procedure  shall  not  exceed  the \nequivalent of $100,000. \n \n6.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n37.  The Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval for advance action to expedite the \nrecruitment  of  consultants  and  procurement  for  civil  works  and  critical  equipment.  ADB \nManagement approved advance procurement action in May 2003. This covers prequalification \nof contractors,  and tendering and bid evaluation for the civil works contract and equipment \npackages, but does not include the signing of contracts. During  subsequent discussions the \nGovernment requested retroactive financing for up to $3.5 million-worth of equipment ordering \nand civil works expected to be incurred from 1 October 2003 to  loan effectiveness. Advance \nordering  will  allow  XHC  to  start  the  power  generation  work  immediately  after  civil  works \ncompletion. On 11 September 2003, ADB Management approved the Government\u2019s request for \nretroactive financing. The Government and the IA have been advised that approval of the \nadvance actions or retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project.10 \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n38.  XHC, through HHDC and ZCG, will maintain separate accounts for the Project and \nrelated financial statements, including (i) a statement of accounting/financial policies, (ii) a cash-\nflow  statement,  (iii) an  imprest  account  statement,  (iv) a statement  of  expenditures,  (v) an \nincome statement, (vi) a balance sheet, and (vii) notes to the financial statements. The income \nstatements will be started on commencement of hydropower operations. HHDC and XHC will \nprepare a set of financial statements for the Project and have them audited annually by \nindependent  auditors.  The  audit  will  be  conducted  in  accordance  with  national  auditing \nstandards. XHC will submit to ADB, within 9 months of the end of each related fiscal year until \nthe  end  of  the  project  period,  certified  copies  of  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements and an auditor's report for the Project, all in English. During project processing, ADB \nreminded the Government of its stringent requirements for timely submission of audited project \naccounts and financial statements, and that noncompliance  with requirements may result in \nsuspension of loan disbursements.  \n \n39.  During the midterm review in 2006, financial projections of HHDC for XHC for the \nfollowing 5 years will be submitted to ADB for its review and such projections will be updated \nannually thereafter. The Government has agreed that, as in previous ADB-financed projects, \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  will  be  made  for  reporting  the  progress  of  project \nimplementation, including cumulative expenditure for civil works as well as for the entire project. \nIn this regard, XHC/HHDC will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports in such form and detail \nas ADB may request, and brief monthly updates. To facilitate postevaluation of the Project, \nXHC/HHDC will furnish  to ADB, within  3 months of project completion, a project completion \n                                                 \n10 XHC has undertaken CNY82 million-worth of preconstruction work such as construction of access road, temporary \nbuildings, slope stabilization, water and electricity supply for construction work. However, these could not qualify \nfor advance procurement or retroactive financing due to lack of compliance with ADB guidelines  regarding \nprocurement.

A summary of financial \nperformance and projections is presented in Appendix 10. In addition, XHC/HHDC will provide \nADB with reports on contract management procedures (including approval of variation orders \nand progress payment certificates), proposed tariff increases, benefit monitoring, and other \nactivities within the required time as stipulated in the Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \n8.  Anticorruption \n \n40.  During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to provincial and \nlocal government officials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption that was \nadded to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. ADB's \nprogram for the PRC includes assistance that will improve governance and provide incentives to \nreduce the incidence of corruption in the longer term.  In 1998,  an ADB TA11 helped the \nGovernment develop detailed guidelines for the selection and engagement of consultants, \naimed to increase transparency, take account of the principles of ADB's anticorruption policy, \nand provide for equal opportunity competition. The resulting guidelines were well received by \nthe Government. ADB  has assisted the Government in  strengthening its auditing system to \nconform to the requirements of the Audit Law and international auditing standards.12 These TAs \nstrengthen the Government's ability to detect fraud and corruption, and ensure transparency in \nthe procurement process. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n41.  A set of indicators for evaluating project performance in relation to its goals, purposes, \noutputs, and conditions have been prepared. Indicators will be reviewed at the start of project \nimplementation and will include (i) economic development and poverty indicators for Gansu and \nthe project area, (ii) energy indicators for Gansu and the project area, (iii) electricity and tariffs, \n(iv) load shedding incidences, (v) financial sustainability of XHC/HHDC, (vi) per capita incomes \nin the project county and townships, (vii) access to social services in the project area, (viii) jobs \ncreated in construction and maintenance of the project, and  (ix)  environmental  indicators. \nEmployment impact indicators will include information about unskilled laborers, poor laborers, \nand women laborers, and will be monitored through  the biannual progress report. At the \nbeginning of project implementation, XHC and ZCG will establish baseline and target values for \nthe indicators. The indicators will be measured at project completion and  3 years later, and \ncompared with the baseline. Where relevant, indicators will be disaggregated by gender. XHC \nand ZCG will recruit a qualified consultant using its own funds for monitoring and evaluation to \nhelp establish the monitoring and evaluation system, and train the IA staff in its use.  Main \nsources of data used include (i) a review of secondary data from government sources, (ii) a \nhousehold socioeconomic sample survey, and (iii) participatory rural appraisal with the help of \nnongovernment organizations in communities affected by XHP, rural electrification, and social \ndevelopment  activities.  A  report  summarizing  the  key  findings  of  monitoring  at  inception, \ncompletion, and  3 years later will be submitted to ADB. A draft PAM will be prepared and \ndiscussed  with  the  EA,  and  form  part  of  the  memorandum  of  understanding  for  project \nimplementation. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998.

Implementing Agency\u2019s Financial Management \n \n42.  A  review  of  XHC/HHDC\u2019s  financial  management  was  undertaken  during  project \nprocessing  (Appendix  11  and  Supplementary  Appendix  G).  Institutional  strengthening  is \nrequired to move XHC toward international best practice in commercial management. XHC will \nupdate  its  chart  of  accounts  to  include  a  subaccount  for  department/branch  (for  each \nadministrative or operational functional department) or project/subproject (for each construction \nor other project element). Supported by changes to the chart of accounts, XHC will introduce \n(i) an annual company-wide business planning and budgeting process, (ii) a system of project \nbudgeting  and  costing,  and  (iii) a  monthly  financial  reporting  and  review  process.  Post \ndescriptions should be created for all existing and new financial department positions. Each post \ndescription  should  clearly  specify  functional  responsibilities,  skills  required  to  meet  these \nresponsibilities, and qualifications and experience required. \n \n43.  To  build  XHC\u2019s  financial  management  capacity,  skills  training  programs  will  be \nimplemented. The training program will be designed for XHC, and delivered through a suitably \nqualified expert in the field. Such training may also be extended to include relevant financial \ndepartment staff within HHDC, as appropriate, and as capacity allows. Clerical accounting skills \nand financial reporting skills in accordance with PRC Accounting Standards are best addressed \nthrough  accounting  courses  provided  by  local  tertiary  institutions.  Additional  training  to \nstrengthen the skills of the financial department staff, and a course in financial management \nprinciples should be conducted for the board of directors and senior management within XHC to \nincrease the commercial acumen of the management team.  \n \n44.  It is essential for XHC to design and implement its own set of financial management and \naccounting policies and procedures, written to address the specific context of the company and \nin terms that are well understood by all relevant management and staff. XHC\u2019s first priority in \nmanagement  information  systems  development  should  focus  on  the  implementation  of  an \neffective financial management information system (FMIS). A critical success factor for the \ncompany will be the ability to plan and manage financial performance. To achieve this, an FMIS \nwill be implemented so that the company will be able to rigorously monitor and control business \nperformance on a regular basis.  \n \nb.  Environmental Measures \n \n45.  A  summary  environmental  impact  assessment  (SEIA)  covering  the  environmental \nanalysis, including environmental benefits, adverse effects, and recommended mitigation and \nmonitoring measures related to the construction and operation of XHP has been prepared and \nwas circulated to the ADB Board on 30 April 2003. The SEIA was based on an environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA) report prepared by the Gansu Environment Protection Research \nInstitute, which was reviewed and approved by the Gansu Environment Protection Bureau. XHC \nsubsequently requested the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) to review the \nEIA and, based on this review, the EIA level was elevated from grade III to II. Additional air, \nwater, and aquatic biota tests were conducted. The Gansu Environmental Protection Bureau, \nthe Forest Bureau, and subsequently SEPA approved the EIA with a final effective date of 21 \nApril 2003. \n ", "  13\nc.  Social Issues  \n \n46.  Activities under the project preparatory TA were carried out in a participatory manner. \nThe consulted parties include township government and electricity distribution company officials \nof six townships, and selected households, schools, local enterprises, and irrigation pumping \nstations to verify information from higher-level official sources and develop a social profile of \nrural townships. The six townships were: Xishui township in Mati district, and Anyang, Huazhai, \nGanjing,  Longqu,  and  Xidong  townships  in  Ganzhou  district.  In  extended  interviews  with \nofficials, the role of electricity and electricity problems in the project area and the differential \ntariffs charged to different classes of consumer were explored. \n \n47.  Resettlement. XHP will permanently occupy 28 hectares (ha) of land, most of which is \ncurrently unused and about 10 ha is grassland. Only 2 households (17 persons) are affected by \npermanent loss of grassland rights, animal sheds, or trees, for which compensation has already \nbeen paid. The Project will also temporarily occupy 26.7 ha (mostly unused land and some \ngrassland) for construction camps, borrow areas, spoil areas, and temporary work areas. Four \nhouseholds (12 persons) will be compensated for temporary losses. In total, only 100 square \nmeters of animal sheds will be affected, and no residential structures need to be relocated. The \nproject components that affect persons are the powerhouse site, 1 km from Bajiaowan village, \nand the widening of the existing road to the powerhouse. The weir and new access road to the \nweir are located along the Heihe river gorge where nobody lives. There will be upgrading of a \n46 km section of class IV road from Huazhai township to Bajiaowan village.  \n \n48.  A short resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared  by XHC, a summary of which is \npresented in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix H. The RP is based on the preliminary \ndesign study and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected households. \nConsultation meetings including XHC, local officials, and affected village leaders were held in \nFebruary  2002  to  establish  the  principles  and  compensation  standards  for  grassland  and \naddress other issues. A formal grassland acquisition compensation agreement was signed in \nMarch 2002 between XHC and Xishui township. XHC has finalized the short RP based on \nconsultation with Xishui township and affected villages. \n \n49.  Minority Issues. There are 32 ethnic minority nationalities in Zhangye City who account \nfor 2.1% of Zhangye\u2019s total population. Among the total minority population, the largest groups \nare the Yugur (37.1%), Zhang/Tibetan (36.6%), and Hui (15.9%), with the rest of the minorities \nconstituting less than 10% of the total. Three fourths of ethnic minorities in Zhangye City are in \nSunan, the only Yugur autonomous county in the PRC. The Yugur ethnic minority is found only \nin Gansu, concentrated at high altitudes around the Qilian mountains. They practice a pastoral \nway of life with herding as the main source, if not the only source, of income. The nationalities \ndirectly affected by the XHP are the Zang in Mati district and the Yugur in neighboring districts, \nall located in Sunan county. Hydropower construction will have minor and very localized impacts \non two villages in Xishui. Despite the large administrative area of 894 km2, the population is only \n1,151. With limited farmland, most households herd animals on mountain grasslands between \n1,500 meters and 4,000 meters. The adverse impacts on minorities caused by minor land \nacquisition will be adequately compensated and are addressed in the short RP. \n \n50.  The local community will benefit economically from its proximity to the construction \nactivities and later to powerhouse operations. Affected persons are all of the Zang minority and \nhave maintained traditional pastoral livelihoods. XHC will not cause significant adverse impacts \non the local people, nor will it alter their pastoral way of life. However, during construction, it will \nprovide opportunities for young people to earn significant income for construction labor and ", "14  \nrelated commercial activities, which will help the villages reduce poverty. The Xishui township \ngovernment  will  develop  strategies  to  ensure  that  the  economic  \u201cboom\u201d  can  be  properly \nmanaged in a manner to strengthen the local communities in harmony with traditional values \nand customs. These approaches are embodied in a community development strategy and plan, \nwhich is supported by XHC (Supplementary Appendix I). The EA will ensure that the community \ndevelopment strategy and plan are finalized, identifying accountability for carrying them out. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n1.  Demand Analysis \n \n51.  The load forecast period for the Gansu network was divided into two terms: short-term \n(3 years) and long-term  (to  the  end  of  the system planning period  in 2020).  A  bottom-up \napproach or  sector analysis method was used for the short-term forecast. Different end-use \ndemands\u2014primary  (agriculture),  secondary  (industry  and  construction),  tertiary  (including \ncommercial and service), and residential (urban and rural)\u2014were calculated based on current \neconomic  activities,  policies,  and  impact  of  recent  major  construction  projects  in  Gansu \nprovince. Three methods\u2014regression, linear time series, and exponential time series\u2014were \nused for forecasting energy consumption.  The regression model used electricity tariff, gross \ndomestic  product,  population,  industry  structure,  and  energy  efficiency  as  independent \nvariables. The historical data from 1986 to 2001 and the short-term demand information (2002\u2013\n2004) were all taken as inputs to the regression model. The estimates of the exponential time \nseries (GWh 89,788) and regression models (GWh 90,083) were similar, whereas the linear \ntime series produced a different trend. The analysis used the estimate from the regression \nmodel and rejected the results from  the linear time series  (Appendix 13 and Supplementary \nAppendix J).  \n \n2.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n52.  Because  of  the  large  gap  between  demand  (1,400\u20132,000 GWh)  and  supply  (750\u2013\n1,200 GWh) in Zhangye City, demand-side responses were not considered as full alternatives in \nthe analysis. Only supply-side options\u2014new generation plants\u2014were used as viable options. \nFive initial alternatives using three power generation technologies\u2014hydropower, coal-fired, and \nnatural-gas-fired\u2014were preliminarily considered for selecting viable electricity generation for the \nprovince. Three fossil fuel generation technologies were considered as technology alternatives: \ncoal-fired thermal (small 300 MW and large 600 MW), and combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT \n300 MW). Technology alternatives, including XHP, were analyzed in detail. Capital and annual \noperation and maintenance (O&M) costs for each technology alternative were examined. The \nhydropower and coal-fired power stations were the only two options that showed a positive net \npresent value (using a 12% discount rate). The larger hydropower option was not considered in \ndetail due to project schedule and hydrologic restrictions; the CCGT option was dropped due to \nthe lack of natural gas in the project area. \n \n53.  For direct comparability, the output of each alternative was normalized. Adjustments \nwere also made for load factor differences. It was assumed that aside from the benefit for \ncapacity substitution for XHC, the alternatives would generate more energy (the load factor is \naround 68%) to substitute generation from small coal-fired plants. The latter could not be used \nto meet incremental demand, but would save fuel consumption in existing plants, bringing ", "  15\nenergy savings benefits. The equalizing discount rate\u2014the rate at which the present value of \ntwo life-cycle cost streams are equal\u2014thus indicating a discount rate at which preference \nchanges\u2014shows  that  hydropower  remains  a  better  alternative  up  to  the  discount  rate  of \n12.85%, after which smaller thermal power units will be preferable. Hydropower, with its high \ncapital costs and very low operational costs, is the preferred option when lower discount rates \nare used (Appendix 13).  \n \n54.  Using viable technological options\u2014hydropower and coal-fired plants\u2014a list of feasible \npower plant alternatives was developed, subject to the constraints imposed by the environment, \nriver flow, and geography/geology. Various hydropower candidates were considered (including \nfew-MW small hydropower stations up to large stations such as the 1,400 MW Heishanxia \nstation). The development sequence for these hydropower candidates before 2010 has been \ndesignated as \u201cfixed scheme\u201d, because either they are under construction or there have been \nother development purposes (flood control and water supply).  XHP is the only candidate for \npower expansion in the period up to 2010 and others, except fixed ones, will be available after \n2010.  \n \n55.  The  Generation  Expansion  System  Planning  (GESP)  II  model  developed  by  Power \nEconomic Research Institute of Beijing was used to identify the least-cost alternative generation \noption from the list of feasible alternatives based on the  demand forecast for  the Gansu power \nsystem. The least-cost analyses confirmed the robustness of XHP. The GESP II model optimized the \nobjective function of minimum total system cost\u2014capital costs, operational costs, and other external \ncosts\u2014to meet power demand within the defined reliability criteria. The planning period used was \n2002 to 2020 and, in order to reflect the operation characteristics of expansion candidates sufficiently, \nthe study period was expanded to 2050. The technical and economic indices of the power system \nfrom 2021 to 2050 were assumed to be same with those in 2020. \n \n56.  Three hydrologic conditions were considered: average with 80% probability, wet with 10% \nprobability, and dry with 10% probability. The production simulation was carried out for all hydrologic \nconditions.  The  least-cost  analysis  used  the  weighted  average  operations  cost  based  on  the \nprobabilities in the objective function. The forecast annual load curve was modeled using three \nseasons: wet season (April to September), average season (October to December), and dry season \n(January to March). Based on historic data, the system peak was modeled in the dry season. The \nfixed system included existing power plants (under construction or decided generation plants, \nretirement plans of generation units, and power exchanges with other power grids. The GESP \nmodel  identified  the  98 MW  (351  GWh)  XHP  as  the  least-cost alternative for generation \nexpansion in Gansu province (Appendix 13).  \n \n3.  Economic Analysis \n \n57.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated for the Project to assess its \neconomic viability (Appendix 14 and Supplementary Appendix K). The costs considered were \ncapital costs, and O&M costs. Appropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial \nvalues into economic values. Values are expressed in 2003 local currency. The quantified \nbenefits of the proposed projects considered in the economic analysis include incremental \nenergy supply  through willingness-to-pay (WTP). The EIRR was computed at 23.4% for the \nProject. Environmental improvement, education, health, and other social benefits were not \nincluded in the economic analysis.13 Sensitivity and risk analyses were carried out simulating \nadverse scenarios, and the project EIRR was found to be stable and robust. \n                                                 \n13 CDM benefits are also excluded. ", "16  \n4.  Financial Analysis \n \n58.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value (FNPV) were \nestimated for XHC. The FIRR is 7.5%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) \nestimated at 4.53%, and the FNPV is CNY152.4 million at  this WACC. The base case is \nconsidered financially feasible. Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR is robust under adverse \nconditions (Appendix 15 and Supplementary Appendix L). The financial viability in terms of \nequity capital and a tariff analysis have been undertaken and are shown in Appendix 16 and \nSupplementary Appendix M.  \n \n59.  An electricity tariff of CNY0.26 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) was assumed for the financial \nanalysis. It is an ADB assumption based on the discussions with various officials. This rate is \nslightly lower than the tariff (CNY0.29/kWh) that XHC claims it would receive from the Zhangye \nElectricity Grid.  \n \n60.  The FIRR measures the viability of a project. The XHC component\u2019s receipts, payments, \nand net cash flows are for the full project period (24 years) where it is assumed that the receipts \nand payments will remain constant in real terms once a steady state is reached. The present \nvalue of net benefits becomes zero at a discount rate of 7.5%, which is the FIRR for the Project. \nSince the cash flows in the FIRR calculation are post-tax, the FIRR is compared against the \npost-tax WACC of 4.53%. Since the FIRR is higher than the WACC, the XHP component is \nfinancially viable. Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR remains robust when tested under \nvarious adverse conditions. \n \nB.  Environmental Benefits \n \n61.  The Project will improve the efficiency  and reliability of the electricity supply and will \nhave significant positive environmental impacts in terms of avoided air pollution from alternative \nenergy sources. This will have positive associated area, regional, and global impacts from \navoided increases in air pollutants. The system planning and least-cost analysis shows that the \nalternative is a 109 MW coal-fired power plant. Based on this alternative, the avoided emissions \nwere estimated at a yearly average of 240 tons, 1,910 tons, 1,500 tons, and 366,000 tons of \nparticulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon dioxide, respectively. With almost \nno trees and shrubs on the riverside mountains along the river section, grass vegetation of only \n15% in the XHP site, with thin soil layers on top of riverside mountains not suitable for grazing, \nno threatened species of wildlife, and few residential settlements\u2014the negative environmental \nimpacts are minimal and can be mitigated. Proper construction; rational reuse and disposal of \nexcavated  soil  and  rock;  proper  treatment  of  wastewater  during  project  construction;  and \nrestoration of construction sites, temporarily occupied land, gravel mining and washing sites, \nand waste rock sites, will mitigate adverse environmental impacts. The improved reliability of \nelectricity in the project area, ecosystem rehabilitation and expansion, and economic and social \nimprovements will enhance the net environmental benefits from the Project. \n \nC.  Social and Poverty Reduction Benefits \n \n62.  Benefits to the poor will largely be in terms of increased economic opportunities. XHP \nconstruction is expected to generate peak employment of 3,000 people. During the O&M of the \npower plant, about 100 permanent staff will be employed (Appendix 17 and Supplementary \nAppendix N). In order to ensure that the hiring of construction labor will benefit local people, \nespecially the poor and women, ADB  has requested XHC, the Zhangye Labor Bureau, and the \nZhangye All-China Women\u2019s Federation to jointly prepare a labor hiring and training plan for the ", "  17\nunskilled workforce and to ensure that contractors implement the plan. Project beneficiaries and \nthe proportion of beneficiaries who are poor are identified in Appendix 17 and on this basis the \npoverty impact ratio was computed at 42%. XHC will also implement additional measures to \nbenefit  local  communities,  including  (i) hiring  and  training  of  local  workers  for  project \nconstruction, (ii) provision of water supply for Bajiaowan village, (iii) allowing access to project \nfacilities (e.g., medical emergencies, transportation, electricity supply), (iv) supporting purchases \nof local supplies and services for local communities, and (v) utilizing  local  work  teams  for \nupgrading existing roads. \n \n63.  A total of 98 MW of clean power in Zhangye will support the expansion of the industry \nand agriculture sectors in Zhangye. The rural electrification component can provide reliable \nelectricity supply for three townships with a total population of 24,037, of whom 22,193 or 92.3% \nare poor, and will encourage new small and medium enterprises that will increase output and \nemployment. The improved electricity will allow Xishui herders to buy crop residues from \nlowland farmers, pass them through electric chaff cutters to feed livestock through the winter, or \nstall-feed more livestock (e.g., cashmere goats penned to collect wool) year round. Reliable \npower would also allow households better access to information (reading at night and in winter, \ntelevision, radio) leading to better social development of poor people in the project area. In the \nfarmer townships of Huazhai and Anyang, the stable voltage and more reliable electricity may \npermit farmers to pump water from the irrigation canals to their higher fields thus increasing the \ncroppable area and reducing the risk of low yields and crop failure. Improved electricity supply \nwill allow households to process crops. It will allow farmer groups to invest in electric threshing \nand winnowing machinery\u2014to allow farmers to go away a month earlier to work in seasonal \nconstruction. In Huazhai township, the improved electricity supply and stable voltage will allow a \n10-bed hospital to use its x-ray and ultrasound machine, presently idled to avoid damage due to \npower fluctuations. \n \n64.  XHC is also required to pay construction tax equal to 4.12% of annual expenditures, of \nwhich 2.0% goes to local government (i.e., Sunan county). This revenue stream to Sunan \ncounty would be in the order of CNY10 million annually, which can be used to improve social \nservices and invest in economic development activities to reduce poverty in the county.  \n \nD.  Assessment of Project Risks \n \n65.  XHC will have several types of risks, including geotechnical, hydrologic, and financial \nrisks, and it has taken appropriate steps to avoid or minimize all of them. The most crucial risks \nare floods and powerhouse location. Site investigations have shown that the rocks underlying \nthe XHP site are of high strength and low mass permeability. Most of the faults are oriented \nnormal to the proposed tunnel alignment and should only affect a limited length of tunnel. A \ndetailed assessment of hydrologic risks is given in Supplementary  Appendix O. A potential \nslope failure on the mountain slope above the powerhouse poses a risk to XHP. XHP is located \nin an area of active geo-morphological development with steep natural slopes and  deeply \nincised valleys. Above the powerhouse the rock is expected to have a strongly developed joint \nsystem including critical joints dipping out of the hill with possible clay infill. Landslide may occur \nas  a  result  of  a  triggering  mechanism,  such  as  a combination  of  sudden rainstorm  and \nearthquake. To overcome the risks, XHC agreed to construct an underground powerhouse.  \n \n66.  Water use rights are an additional project risk. XHC has obtained a license to use the \nriver  for  XHP.  There  is  a  comprehensive  plan  to  develop  additional  hydropower  capacity \nupstream in a cascade system. The Ministry of Water Resources and the National Development \nand Reform Commission approved a planning document that includes allocation of water rights ", "18  \nin the river basin. The EA has obtained water user rights for operation of XHP from the Water \nResource Bureau of ZCG.  \n \n67.  Additional  intangible  risks  exist  due  to  ongoing  restructuring  of  the  power  sector. \nGeneration assets will be separated from transmission and distribution, and market pricing of \ngenerated power will be introduced in stages. Increased competition in the power generation \nsector may depress wholesale electricity prices. In Zhangye City, the demand-supply imbalance \nis expected to persist for several more years, as reflected in the project financial analyses. \nAdditional generating capacity is proposed for the Zhangye City area, primarily the 150 MW \nLongshou phase II hydropower plant (downstream of the project site). The 600 MW Pingliang \ncoal-fired power plant, proposed for the Gansu grid, would meet some of the Zhangye City \ndemand. Large natural gas-fired plants are not currently planned in Zhangye City. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n68.  GPG, ZCG, and XHC have agreed to the following specific assurances, in addition to the \nstandard assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i) Power Sector Reform: GPG and ZCG will cause Zhangye Electric Power Company (ZEPC) \nand XHC to implement the power sector and tariff reform program of the Government and tariff \nreduction programs, including a lifeline tariff for poor consumers as agreed upon with ADB. \n \n(ii) Tariff: GPG and ZCG  shall be responsible for formulating tariff of the electricity generated \nby XHP will be adequate for XHC to cover operating costs, maintenance and depreciation, \nfinancing cost, and, from fiscal year 2009, allow an acceptable return on the net fixed assets.  \n \n(iii) Other  Projects  and  Policy  Change:  GPG  will  consult  with  ADB  prior  to  any  project \napprovals for new generation, transmission, and distribution investments, and any changes in \npower pricing policies that may affect the Project and operations of XHP. \n \n(iv) Financial Performance: From 2008, there will be a debt service coverage ratio of at least \n1.2 times; and from 2010, 1.3 times.

GPG and ZCG will ensure that any proposed change in ownership of the project \nfacilities will be carried out in a legal and transparent manner. \n \n(xv) Human Resources Development and Training: XHC (in consultation with HHDC) will \nprepare a human resources development plan. Before undertaking international training, XHC \nwill prepare, for ADB\u2019s concurrence, (i) a training plan and number of trainees, (ii) a program of \nworkshops to be delivered by those trained internationally, and (iii) a list of training equipment \nand aids required to strengthen XHC\u2019s and HHDC\u2019s training programs. Upon completion, XHC \nwill submit to ADB an evaluation of the international and domestic training carried out.  \n \n(xvi) Shareholders\u2019 General Meeting: In accordance with the company law of the Government, \nXHC will convene a general meeting of  shareholders once a year within 6 months  of the ", "20  \ncompletion of the previous accounting year and convene  a temporary general meeting of the \nshareholders to discuss and decide on the matters in accordance with its articles of association.  \n \n(xvii) Supervisory  Board:  XHC  will  ensure  that  its  supervisory  board  will  be  formed  in \naccordance with the  Government\u2019s company law,  and that it  comprises representatives of \nshareholders and includes an appropriate proportion of representatives of the staff and workers \nof XHC.

Clean Energy Subsector Review \n \n1.  Potential for Hydropower  \n \n1.  Practically usable hydropower resources are located in the southwest, central, and \nnorthwest part of the country. The hydropower potential is estimated to be 378 gigawatts (GW) \nof which only 83 GW is currently utilized\u2014which is about 24% of the total installed capacity \nmaking the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) the third largest country in the world in terms of \ntotal installed hydropower capacity. The potential for small-scale hydropower is also large with \npotential in all regions of the PRC. It is estimated that, among over 2,000 counties in the whole \ncountry, more than 1,100 are suitable for building small-scale hydropower stations of over 10 \nmegawatts (MW). The total potential for medium and small hydropower resources is about \n139 GW. Most of these are located in the vast mountainous areas, which account for 70% of the \ncountry's total land area. The installed capacity of small hydropower amounted to over 19 GW \nand the annual electricity output of 64 terawatt-hours (TWh). Hydropower supplies electricity to \n300 million people in about 800 counties, covering nearly half of the country's area and 70% of \nthe mountainous area.  \n \n2.  Wind, Solar, and Other Renewable Energy in Gansu Province  \n \n2.  The provincial government is committed  to developing wind energy as a sustainable \ngreen source of energy for the province. Supported by a loan from the Government of Spain, \nthe Yumen Wind Power  Station, the largest in Gansu province, with an installed capacity of \n8 MW, is expected to generate about 19 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity per year. Gansu \nprovince plans to build at least three wind power stations in 5 years, with a combined installed \ncapacity  of  100 MW.  In  1993,  Gansu  province  designed  a  Rural  Electrification  Project  to \npromote solar electric energy technology to meet the electrical needs of rural Gansu residents. \nThe project targeted poor households in the province and subsidized about 20% of the retail \nprice of the systems for end users. The project was to install 600 20-watt systems with a battery \nto power two 8-watt florescent lights and a black and white television for two to three hours per \nnight. In addition, several Gansu schools would install larger systems and, on an experimental \nbasis, satellite reception for nomadic herders was also tested under the project. This was done \nin collaboration with the United States Department of Energy and Gansu Solar Electric Fund.  \n3.  Gansu Province Hydropower Resources  \n \n3.  Nine river systems in the Yellow, Yangtze, and inland river drainage basins with an \nannual discharge of 61.4 billion cubic meters are the main water resources in Gansu province. \nThe combined hydropower potential is estimated at 17 GWh. The province has constructed 29 \nhydropower stations with a total installed generating capacity of about 3,000 MW and an annual \noutput of 11 TWh. Heihe river, the largest inland river in Gansu province, originates from Qilian \nmountain and Datong mountain. The river runs through Qinghai province, Gansu province, and \nInner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  and  terminates  in  Juyanghai  of  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region. Heihe river has hydropower potential of 453 MW, of which only 59 MW \nhas been tapped through Longshou phase I project. Longshou phase II project (142 MW) is \nunder construction. Under the Heihe river basin development plan,there are eight medium-sized \nhydropower  stations  proposed,  namely:  Huangzangsi,  Sandaoheigou,  Chouniugou, \nSandaowan, Dagushan, Shiyangling (replaced by Xiaogushan), Xiliushui, and Yingluoxia. The \nproposed 98 MW Xiaogushan project will be the third operational power station on the Hei He \nriver basin development plan. \n ", "24   Appendix 2 \n4.  Since 1998, four small hydropower stations have been constructed and commissioned \ndownstream of the Heihe cascade system: Longqui No.1 (3 x 4 MW), Longqui No. 2 (2 x 2 MW \nplus 1 x 1.6 MW), Longqui No. 3 (3 x 1.25 MW), and Longqui No. 4 (3 x 1 MW). These stations \nhave been integrated with the existing irrigation system in Sunnan county, south of the Zhangye \nCity urban center. \n \nB.  Institutional Reforms and Power Sector  \n \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA)1 to develop a \nplan for power sector restructuring in the PRC and to introduce competitive markets. The TA \nrecommended, among others, a strategy for reforming  the  power market, optimal industry \nstructure, wholesale electricity market design options, and the preferred design and options for \nmanaging  long-term  reliability  and  system  security.  The  Government  used  the \nrecommendations in formulating its reform strategy. \n \n1.  Responsibilities of Power Sector Institutions \n \n6.  The State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), State Development and Planning \nCommission, and Ministry of Finance (MOF) were the key administrative organizations in the \npower  sector.  SETC  was  a  department  directly  reporting  to  the  State  Council  and  was \nresponsible for state-owned enterprises in the power sector. Its responsibilities were to: plan for \nthe  power  industry;  establish  rules,  norms,  and  technical  standards;  propose  policies  on \nelectricity and heat prices; provide the primary review of power projects; provide advice on rural \nelectrification  and  small  grids;  and  conduct  planning  for  wind  power.  Each  province  had \neconomic and trade commissions at the provincial level, and the power department of SETC \nwas responsible for provincial power administration. SDPC was a department under the State \nCouncil and its responsibilities were to review and approve new power projects, establish price \npolicies, and approve prices. It had provincial branches  that were responsible for the power \nprojects and price control at the provincial level. MOF\u2019s responsibilities in the power sector were \nto establish and manage the financial system for power firms, establish tax policies in the power \nsector, and protect the value of state-owned assets.  \n \n2.  Power Sector Restructuring \n \n7.  In April 2002, the Government issued a proposal for power sector reform, and stated the \nobjective of reform as the introduction of competition for efficiency improvements, reduction of \ncost,  implementation  of  a  market-based  pricing  mechanism,  optimal  resource  allocation, \nnationwide grid connection, and separation of government and commercial functions. During the \n10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005), the major tasks for power sector reform are: separation of \npower plants from grids, restructuring of generation and grid companies, establishment of a new \nregulatory framework for competition, establishment of competitive regional power markets, \nimplementation of a new pricing mechanism, establishment of new environmental standards, \nencouragement of cleaner power development, study of pilot for direct sales to large users, and \nrural power sector reform. \n \n    a.  Transmission and Distribution Network \n \n8.  The Government has established two new grid and distribution businesses: the State \nPower  Grid  Corporation  in  Beijing,  and  the  Southern  Power  Grid  Corporation  based  in \nGuangzhou, Guangdong Province. The Southern Power Grid Corporation covers five provinces \nincluding  Guangdong,  Guangxi,  Yunnan,  Hainan,  and  Guizhou.  The  State  Power  Grid \nCorporation  will  cover  the  remaining  provinces  in  the  interim.  Five  regional  power  grid \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

", "  Appendix 2  25\ncompanies\u2014the North China, Northeast China, East China, Central China and Northwest Grid \nCorporations\u2014will  be  established  under  the  State  Power  Grid  Corporation.  The  key \nresponsibilities of the State Power Grid Corporation will be (i) electricity trading and dispatching \namong the regional power grids, and (ii) participating in the investment and construction of the \nregional power grids. The regional power grid companies will be responsible for (i) managing \nand  operating  the  regional  grids,  (ii) ensuring  reliability  of  power  supply,  (iii) planning and \nprogramming the development of the regional grids, (iv) fostering the regional power markets, \n(v) operating  and  managing  the  regional  trading  centers,  and  (vi) dispatching  electricity \naccording to grid rules. It is understood that the regional power grid companies will be set up in \n2003. The existing provincial power companies will be restructured into branches or subsidiaries \nof the regional power grid companies. \n \n    b.  Regulatory Reform  \n \n9.  The Government has abolished the State Economic and Trade Commission and merged \nits  functions  into  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (formerly  the  State \nDevelopment and Planning Commission). The State Council formally established the State \nElectricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) in October 2002; with the status of a ministry, this \nagency directly reports to the State Council. SERC is empowered to perform administrative and \nregulatory duties with regard to the national electric power sector in accordance with laws and \nregulations. The Government finalized the overall regulatory framework including the objectives \nof the SERC, its structure, and some of the codes and rules for effective regulation. \n   \nc.  Generation Sector \n \n10.  To ensure a sufficient number of competitive generation companies in each market, the \nreform plan restructured the generation capacities of the State Power Corporation (SPC) into \nfive independent generation companies. Each company is allowed to own a maximum of 20% \ninstalled  generation  capacity  in  each  electricity  market.  The  five  independent  generation \ncompanies are Huaneng Group, China Huadian Group, China Power Investment Group, China \nGuodian Group, and China Datang Group.  Some of the generation capacity has also been \nallocated to the two grid companies for the purpose of safe and reliable operation of the grids. \nOf the five generating companies, four will hold  a roughly equal share of about 30 GW of \ncapacity, while Huaneng will obtain about 38 GW. Figure A2 shows the industry structure. \n \n11.  Competition  in  supply  will  not  be  introduced  under  this  reform  plan,  but  a  single \ncorporatized supply company will be established at the national levels. Corporatized generation \nand  transmission  companies  will  be  encouraged  to  raise  capital  in  the  domestic  and \ninternational capital markets. Transmission and distribution will not be separated, but internal \nseparate accounting will be established for the two businesses. Grid companies will be allowed \nto own pumped-storage generation and other forms of small-scale generation as reserve for \nemergencies, or for systems support.

", "  Appendix 3  27\nSUMMARY OF EXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED \n \n \n1.  External sources, including direct foreign investment, are increasingly being promoted \nand now finance about 20% of total annual investments in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) energy sector. These are used mainly in the power subsector. The Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has provided 11 public subsector loans totaling $1.34 billion for the PRC power \nsubsector. These include three hydropower, four thermal power, and two power transmission \nprojects, one renewable energy (grid-connected wind power) project, and one pumped storage \nproject. ADB has made strategic use of technical assistance (TA) to help prepare projects, \nprovide policy support, and build the institutional capabilities of  power utilities that are the \nexecuting agencies of ADB loans. Among external agencies, ADB has taken a leading role in \nproviding support for (i) corporatizing power utilities, (ii) developing the policy and regulatory \nframeworks for encouraging foreign investment in the power sector, (iii) introducing competitive \nbidding  procedures  for  the  selection  of  build-own-operate  and  build-own-transfer  projects, \n(iv) strengthening financial management of power plants, and (v) rationalizing the power tariff \nstructure.  \n \n2.  The World Bank is the largest official source of external funding for the power sector. As \nof April 2003, it had provided $5.8 billion to finance 25 power projects, most of which are large-\nscale thermal power or hydropower projects. The World Bank's 2003 program does not include \nany power projects. Its future program is expected to focus mainly on renewable energy projects \nunder the World Bank-Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Partnership for Renewables. \nRecently, World Bank TA for the power sector has been mainly supporting the Government's \nefforts to design and implement detailed regulatory procedures for deregulation. The United \nNations Development Programme is also providing assistance to help the Government evaluate \nvarious options for power sector restructuring and for promoting energy conservation.  \n \n3.  Among the bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the \nlargest source of external assistance. It has provided concessional loans totaling \u00a5438 billion \n($4.0 billion at the  current exchange rate) for 14 power sector projects through its official \ndevelopment assistance window, excluding those assisted through export credits and untied \nyen loans provided by the former Export-Import Bank of Japan. JBIC has also provided special \ncredits to major cities to improve their environment through the installation of emission control \ndevices and equipment in power plants and factories, and through building water treatment \nfacilities. JBIC is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance to the power sector from \nhydro and thermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly \nin the western region. Germany, through Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW), has provided \napproximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and turbine modernization \nprojects. KfW has been also assisting the Government in energy efficiency, providing credit \nlines, and renewable energy development. Other bilateral sources, mostly providing export \ncredits or mixed credits, include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United \nKingdom, and United States.  \n \n4.  To  address  the  risk  of  overlapping  investments,  aid  coordination  among  external \nagencies remains essential. ADB has established a close working relationship with the World \nBank in addressing policy issues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and continues to \nexchange views with bilateral sources and the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank \nhave emphasized the importance of improving the management of power utilities, tariff reforms, \nefficiency improvement, environmental protection, and a greater role for the private sector. \nDuring the processing of the proposed Project, discussions were held with the World Bank, \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nJBIC, and KfW to ensure that their respective activities are complementary and to maintain \nconsistency in policy advice. \n \nB.  Lessons Learned \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s experience in the PRC\u2019s energy sector has shown that its projects are generally \nwell planned and implemented smoothly. Executing agencies and implementing agencies have \npersonnel with good technical skills and have made effective use of the training financed under \nADB  loans  to  build  their  institutional  capacity.  Compliance  with  covenants  is  generally \nacceptable, although greater efforts are required to implement the policy-related covenants, \nparticularly those relating to diversification of enterprise ownership at the micro level in line with \nproject commitments and policy directions. The rigorous government screening of projects has a \npositive impact. Energy conservation projects have experienced some delays, mainly because \nof their complex multicomponent nature involving several implementing agencies in different \nprovinces. Delays have also occurred for some projects in loan signing and loan effectiveness, \nas well as in procurement, construction, and commissioning. The Government is streamlining \nthe multiple approval process to address these problems. \n \n6.  Power utilities have been weak in the area of commercial and financial management. \nOften, there is a need for institutional strengthening in the areas of organizational structure, \ndelegation of authority, management, information and control systems, accounting and financial \nmanagement, and personnel development and training. So far, four of 10 public power sector \nprojects financed by ADB in the PRC have been completed; these are the Fuel Conversion \nProject,1 Shanxi Liulin Thermal Power Project,2 Hunan Lingjintan Power Project,3 and Henan \nPower Project.4 The project completion and project performance audit reports for these projects, \nwhere prepared,   indicate that they were implemented smoothly, and assess them all as \ngenerally  successful.  Some  cost  increases  as  well  as  minor  delays  were  noted. \nRecommendations  from  the  experience  gained  highlight  (i) the  need  to  improve  financial \nreporting; (ii) the need for more attention to environmental matters; (iii) the advisability of using \nlarger boiler-turbine units; and (iv) the importance of capacity building, not only for project \npreparation, but also for training staff in operational and managerial aspects of power utility \noperations. A reevaluation of the Fuel Conversion Project, which was completed in December \n1999, revised the project rating downward to unsuccessful in economic terms and concludes \nthat ADB-financed projects in the energy sector should not be narrowly focused on expected \neconomic gains, which may not materialize, and should be rigorously screened to ensure that \nthey are in line with ADB\u2019s energy policy.5 Recently, some ongoing power projects in the PRC \nhave  experienced  some  implementation  delays  in  meeting  procurement  and  construction \ndeadlines. This is mainly due to the ongoing restructuring of the power sector and consequent \nchange  in  the  \u201cownership\u201d  of  the  projects.  Nevertheless,  the  overall  implementation \nperformance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the PRC is satisfactory.6 \n                                                                 \n1  ADB. 1987.

The above lessons have been taken into account in designing the Project. (A summary \nof the lessons learned is given in Table A3.) A comprehensive feasibility study was prepared by \nconsultants. Local currency financing was structured to ensure an appropriate mix of debt and \ngovernment equity.

Introduction \n \n1.  The Zhangye City area is power deficient (94.5 megawatt [MW] of installed capacity vs. \n200 MW peak demand) and currently imports power from the Lanzhou network over a 500-\nkilometer (km) transmission line (300 kV). Given the projected growth in demand and the \nshortages  in  the  Zhangye  system,  electricity  generated  by  the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower \nCompany (XHC) will be consumed within Zhangye. Zhangye\u2019s excess demand is currently \nbeing met by imports of electricity generated mainly by thermal power stations, and the supply is \ntherefore dependent on the availability of surplus in the Lanzhou system. This results in erratic \nsupply and poor quality service, especially for low-end and poor rural consumers. \n \nB.  Baseline \n \n2.  Several baselines can be considered for the Project, for example: (i) the current power \nsupply mix of the Zhangye grid; (ii) power expansion plans for the Zhangye grid; or (iii) electricity \nimports from the Lanzhou system. Analysis of economic least-cost system expansion plans led \nto defining the appropriate baseline for the Project as the proposed expansion of the Zhangye \ngrid with a new 300 MW or 600 MW coal-fired power plant. The proposed baseline conforms to \nthe second  approach  approved  by  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate \nChange Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Executive Board.1 \n \n3.  The baseline will be an average of 860 tons of carbon dioxide (CO ) emitted per \n2\ngigawatt-hour (GWh) of electricity generated in the system (the equivalent CO  emissions from \n2\na 300 MW coal-fired plant). This is a conservative estimate as it does not include efficiency \nlosses resulting from operating a coal-fired plant to meet peak loads. No CO  emissions would \n2\nresult  from  the  Project  leading  to  net  emissions  reductions  and  rendering  the  Project \nenvironmentally additional, as defined by the CDM Executive Board. The expected net CO  \n2\nreduction due to the Project will be 348,000 tons equivalent (tone) per year. The Project \ncontributes to sustainable development through: \n \n(i)  use of local renewable energy resources to displace thermal power generation in the \nprovince, resulting in improvement in local air quality (including indoor air quality); \n(ii)  increased local economic and commercial activity through reliable and better quality \npower from a clean and renewable source; and \n(iii)  generation of employment in the project area and surrounding region. As noted, \nZhangye City is one of the poorest areas in the province. \n \nC  Crediting Period \n \n4.  The choice of two crediting periods is possible: (i) a maximum fixed term of 10 years, or \n(ii) an initial term of 7 years with possibility of renewal twice, provided that the baseline is \nreviewed and updated for each renewal. For the Project, it is appropriate to consider the first \noption, with a fixed term of 10 years, as it lends certainty to the Project. Once approved, the \nbaseline is valid for 10 years and the Project will not be required to meet the evolving rules on \nadditionality and baselines. Based on the above assumptions of power generation, baseline, \nand crediting period, the Project will result in an aggregate of 3.48 million tone of CO  over a 10-\n2\n                                                 \n1  The approach approved by the CDM Executive Board is \u201cemissions from a technology that represents an \neconomically attractive course of action, taking into account barriers to investment\u201d (Decision 17/CP.7 of the \nMarrakesh Accords, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). In view of the investment barriers \nthe baseline scenario represents what would have occurred in the absence of the project activity. \n ", "    Appendix 4  31\nyear crediting period. Table A4 gives the estimated revenue from the Project\u2019s sale of certified \nemission reductions (CERs) at $3.00 and $5.00 per tone of CO . The CER revenues can \n2\nprovide 12\u201320% of the project cost on undiscounted basis, respectively. \n  \nTable A4: Estimated Revenue from Certified Emissions Reductions \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  $3/tone of CO   $5/tone of CO  \n2 2\nAnnual Revenue Stream from CERs   1,044  1,740 \nRevenue Stream for 10-year Crediting Period   10,440   17,400  \n     \nCO = carbon dioxide, CERs = certified emissions reductions, tone = ton equivalent. \n2 \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \nD.  Monitoring and Verification Plan \n \n5.  The amount of verified emission reductions (VER) from the Project will depend on the \nextent of electricity generated and sold to the grid. The point of sale is the 110-kilovolt (kV) \nsubstation, where electricity sales data from XHC will be metered and monitored. The baseline \nemissions and the annual electricity sales quantity will provide the actual quantity of CERs \ngenerated by the Project. This data can easily be verified with minimal verification costs. \n \nE.  Clean Development Mechanism Requirements \n \n6.  Donors such as the World Bank, the United Nations\u2019 Environmental Programme, and \nseveral  bilateral  agencies  are  actively  involved  in  CDM  related  activities  in  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC). Through a stand-alone technical assistance, ADB is assisting small-\nscale CDM project development in the PRC. 2 To develop the Project under CDM, various levels \nof clearances from the Government are required. Upon receiving such clearances, nomination, \nand  other  necessary  documents,3 the  Project  can  be  registered.  Final  clearance  can  be \nobtained from the CDM Executive Board when the Project fulfils all requirements of the Kyoto \nProtocol. \n \n7.  Entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol is necessary for any CERs to be recognized. \nAlthough PRC has ratified the Protocol, overall ratification and effectiveness of the Protocol are \nstill  uncertain.  Despite  non-ratification,  some  Annex  B  parties  have  indicated  several \ncommitments  to  buy  CERs  resulting  in  a  nascent  but  functioning  market  for  emissions \nreductions. For example the World Bank\u2019s Prototype Carbon Fund has developed a system of \npurchasing verified emission reductions (VERs) instead of CERs. There are several other \npotential buyers in the market with the best current offer price ranging from $3-5 per tone of \nCO .  \n2\n \n8.  For  XHC,  discussions  have  been  initiated  by  the  Prototype  Carbon  Fund  and  the \nGovernment for possible sale of VERs. However, at the moment, no other potential buyers have \nindicated their interest in trading CERs with XHC. It should also be noted that the operation \nlevel, and the power generated by the Project with respect to overall financial and economic \nperformance would also have direct impacts on CER revenues. More details and draft project \ndevelopment  documents  that  might  be  required  for  CER  sales  can  be  found  at \nwww.xhconline.com.  \n                                                 \n2  ADB.  2002.

Assumptions and Basis of Cost Estimates \n \n1.  The total cost estimate for the Project is $87million (CNY719 million). These figures are \ncomparable with the cost estimates for Longshu hydropower project on Heihe river, completed \nin 2001, and the cost estimates for Xiliushui hydropower project (under construction) on Heihe \nriver. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) findings note that the construction \nschedule for the diversion structures has no work scheduled during the wet season or winter \nwhen freezing is a problem. The costs of materials, labor, and construction have been adjusted \nto include such harsh conditions. The cost of transport to the project site has also been carefully \nadjusted. The other major features on the cost estimates are: (i) cost per unit kilowatt (kW) is \nCNY7,342, and (ii) loan interest rate during construction is 5.76% with the total financial charges \nduring development amounting to CNY75 million. \n \n  1.  Civil Work Cost Estimates \n \n2.  The unit prices for civil work construction costs are based on the Gansu province official \nprices.  Methodology  for  calculating  these  prices  are  approved  by  the  Gansu  Water \nConservation  Administration.  It  is  recognized  that  these  are  lower  than  construction costs \nelsewhere in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) because of economic conditions within the \nprovince. However, the Gansu Design Institute (GDI) has advised that the unit prices for civil \nwork  the  construction  have  also  been  checked  against  actual  bid  unit  prices  of  recent \nhydropower  projects  in  the  province,  particularly  the  downstream  Longshou  and  Xiliushui \nhydropower projects.  \n \n  2.  Equipment Cost Estimates \n \n3.  For major equipment, the cost estimates are based on GDI\u2019s in-house cost data and \nprice quotations from local and international equipment manufacturers. This is a reasonable \napproach. In consultation with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Appraisal Mission, GDI \nalso obtained actual bid prices from projects under construction or recently completed (in the \nlast  5  years)  to  finally  derive  the  cost  estimates.  The  ADB  Mission  noted  that  foreign-\nmanufactured  generating  equipment  (of  similar  but  smaller  capacity)  was  provided  at  the \nLongshou hydropower project, and was commissioned in 2001. In some occasions, project \ncosts were estimated using simple regression analysis for the data from comparable projects of \ndifferent sized equipment.  \n \n  3.  Contingencies \n \n4.  The  estimate  includes  provision  for  about  2.6%  of  physical  and  1%  of  price \ncontingencies.1 This could be low considering the current status of the Project and the difficulty \nof accurately predicting tunneling conditions. The low level of contingency funds reflects the \nresults of ongoing policy dialogue on loan surplus in PRC projects. \n \nB.  Proposed ADB Loan and Project Financing \n \n5.  The proposed ADB loan will have a total loan period of 24 years including a grace period \nof 4 years and a repayment period of 20 years. The financial expenses for the ADB loan \n                                                 \n1  These include no price contingencies for foreign exchange cost.  ", "  Appendix 5  33\ncomprise a floating interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending rate, a fixed spread component of 0.6% based on the \nfloating rate, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and a front-end fee of 0.5%. Other \nterms and conditions for the ADB loan are set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements.  \n \n6.  On the basis of the cost estimates, Project financing comes from three sources: owners\u2019 \nequity contribution, ADB loan, and domestic bank loan. The proportion among the three is to be \napproximately 16.1% equity financing, 40.2% ADB loan financing, and 43.7% domestic loan \nfinancing. With regard to the required equity contribution, Hei He Hydropower Development \nCompany will contribute 50%, Zhangye Water and Power Bureau will contribute 30%, whilst \nGansu Yin Long Construction Company Limited, a private enterprise, will take the remaining \n20% equity. The terms of the domestic loan from Bank of China, are 15-year repayment at an \nannual interest rate of 5.76%. According to the preliminary design, it is assumed the funds will \nbe drawn during 4 years in annual proportions of 15%, 40%, 35%, and 10%, respectively.  \n \n7.  Interest expense incurred on the domestic loan during the construction period will be \nfully capitalized. The loan principal is assumed to be repaid with an annuity each year during the \n20 years starting from the commencement of operation, whilst the associated interest will be \npaid annually. For the ADB loan, the front-end fee is to be charged once for the total loan \namount at the very beginning of the loan period. The commitment charge is to be incurred on \nthe un-withdrawn portion of the loan on a yearly basis as given in the loan agreement. The \nmarket-based floating interest including LIBOR and the fixed spread will be charged annually to \nthe amount drawn and outstanding. The schedule of loan principal repayment, after the 4-year \ngrace period, is prepared with installment shares, which are determined on the annuity basis \nusing a 10% discount rate as stipulated in the ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook dated \nJanuary 2001. \n ", "34   Appendix 5 \nTable A5: Detailed Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total \nComponent  Exchange*  Currency  Costs \n           \nA.

Similarly, other key positions  should also be the full-time XHC \npositions for the entire duration of core project activities. Other key areas to be addressed are: \ndefining the purpose of each position (vice presidents, engineering departments, general office); \nclarifying how the Project will be handled through the organizational structure; and defining \nresponsibilities for areas crucial to the Project, such as environment. \n \n3.

This represents about 3.48  gigawatt-hours (GWh) generated per \nemployee, which is on the high side, considering that for small  hydropower generation, the \nbenchmark figure is about 2.6\u20133.5 GWh per employee. Other employee benefits included are: \nwelfare benefits, 14%; labor protection; 31%; housing fund, 5%; education fund 1.5%; and labor \nunion,  2%  of  salary.  The  Gansu  Tax  Bureau  decided  that  XHC  would  be  entitled  to  a \npreferential income tax rate of 15% until 2010, instead of the general income tax rate of 33%. In \naddition, it will enjoy tax-free treatment for the first 2 profit-making years. XHC will retain after-\ntax profit and no dividends will be paid. Other local taxes include: value-added tax, 17%; city tax \n5%; and education tax of 3% on sales.  \n \n3.  Administration and Maintenance  \n \n4.  The working capital requirement is considered to be CNY12 per kilowatt (kW) of installed \ncapacity, a standard commonly used for projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The cost of \nmaterials is estimated using a benchmark figure of CNY6/kW and administrative expenses as \nCNY15/kW. A relatively higher figure of CNY0.0020/kWh for maintenance is used considering \nthe remoteness and extreme weather conditions at the project area. Insurance cost of 0.25% \nand plant maintenance cost of 1.15% of fixed asset value are used for financial modeling. \n \n4.  Forecast Quantities \n \n5.  XHC falls into the price-taker category. Analysis assumes the steady state level gross \ngeneration of 366 GWh per year until 2014 and about 348 GWh from 2015 onward. It is \nassumed that the generation tariff will fall by 5% (real terms) in 2009 and by 10% from 2019 \nonward. The steady state generation levels are based on extensive technical and hydrologic \nanalysis. Various technical experts\u2019 estimates for average energy potential range from 370 GWh \nto 400 GWh per year. Technical modeling is based on 57 years of monthly inflow data adjusted \nfor the minimum environmental flow of 1.6 cubic meters per second into the river between the \ntunnel intake and the power house. Analysis assumes that the plant will start operation in 2006, \nand will generate about 90 GWh (25% of steady state generation) in the first year and full \ncapacity will be realized from 2007 onward. The estimated generation of 351 GWh per year by a \n98-megawatt (MW) power station represents a plant utilization factor of 43%. \n \n ", "   \n \n \nTable A10.1: Income Statements \n(CNY

The board of directors will meet at least \ntwice a year and more frequently if deemed required to deal with issues in hand. The directors will \nelect the chairperson from among them based on knowledge and experience in the industry and a \nproven senior management track record. The main procedural functions of the chairperson are to \npreside over shareholders\u2019 meetings, and to convene and chair meetings of the directors. \n \n4.  Audit Committee  \n \n4.  XHC will constitute a board  of AC with qualifications and experience acceptable to  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The AC will comprise a chairperson and two other nonexecutive \nmembers, each of whom will be appointed by the board of directors. The chairperson of the board \nof directors cannot be the chairperson of the AC. The head of the internal audit department will be \nrequired to attend and report to the AC. Principal duties and responsibilities of the AC are to review \nand supervise the financial reporting process and internal controls process and internal controls \nincluding: (i) recommend the appointment of external  advisers, and liaise with the advisers on \nissues such as compliance with accounting standards and other matters raised concerning XHC\u2019s \nauditing standards and internal reporting and control procedures; (ii) review financial reporting and \ninternal control procedures; (iii) review any reports released by the internal audit department; and \n(iv) review the management of financial matters and focus on the independence and objectivity of \nthe external advisers, and the freedom allowed to the internal audit department. XHC will form an \ninternal audit unit with at least one staff member who is a certified accountant with accounting and \nauditing experience. The internal audit unit will directly report to AC. The  board of directors will \nendorse the roles and responsibilities of internal auditors.  \n \n5.  Job Descriptions and Budgeting \n \n5.  At present there is no written job description for XHC staff. Prior to the commencement of \nthe Project, a document containing the  various job descriptions should be developed. The job \ndescriptions should clearly define the duties and responsibilities of personnel, lines of supervision, \nand limits of authority for all of the officers, managers, and staff. It appears that the budgeting \naspect of XHC needs to be strengthened substantially. Existing process of budget preparation is \nonly appropriate due to the limited activities of XHC; however, once the Project is implemented, a \nmore sophisticated procedure should be developed. Before the start of each project year, XHC \nshould have individual budget highlighting total planned expenditure and other relevant cost activity \nplanned for the coming year. These individual budgets should then be consolidated to produce the \ncorporate budget.  \n \n6.  Training of Personnel for Capacity Building \n \n6.  It is vital that personnel of the internal audit unit and finance department are trained on the \ndifferent ADB procedures and requirements to ensure smooth project implementation. In addition a \ntraining program should also be developed in areas identified as lacking. These areas include \nproject budgeting, costing, department budgeting, financial analysis, internal control, and auditing.  ", "46 Appendix 12 \nSUMMARY LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \n1.  Project construction will have minor and very localized impacts on two villages in Xishui \ntownship. The population of Xishui township is only 1,151 despite a large administrative area of \n894 square kilometers. Farmland is very limited so people earn their livelihood as herders. The \nProject will permanently occupy 28 hectares (ha) of land, most of which is wasteland and about \n10 ha is grassland. Only two households (17 persons) will be affected by permanent loss of \ngrassland rights, animal sheds, or trees, for which compensation has already been paid. The \nProject  will  also  temporarily  occupy  26.7  ha  (mostly  wasteland  and  some  grassland)  for \nconstruction camps, borrow areas, spoil areas, and temporary work areas. Four households (12 \npersons) will be compensated for temporary losses. In total, only 100 square meters of animal \nsheds will be affected; no residential structures need to be relocated. Since the Project is a run-\nof-river hydropower plant, components that affect people are the powerhouse site and the \nwidening of the existing road to the powerhouse.  \n \n2.  A short resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared  by the  Xiaogushan  Hydropower \nCompany (XHC) (Supplementary Appendix G). The RP is based on the preliminary design \nstudy  and  consultations  with  local  officials,  village  leaders,  and  affected  households. \nConsultation meetings including XHC, local officials, and affected village leaders were held in \nFebruary 2002 to establish the principles and compensation standards for grassland and to \naddress other issues. A formal grassland acquisition compensation agreement was signed in \nMarch 2002 between XHC and Xishui township. \n \n3.  The resettlement objective is to ensure attainment of equal or  better livelihoods and \nliving standards in line with the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Land Administration Law \n(1998), the PRC Grassland Law (1985), and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (1995). The RP compensation standards are based on the Land \nAdministration Regulation for Gansu province and the Grassland Management Regulations of \nSunan county. XHC will ensure that any people losing land, structures, other assets, or other \nmeans of production will be assisted in restoring their incomes and living standards to at least \nthe levels without the Project\u2019s intervention. Lost assets will either be replaced or their owners \ncompensated at replacement cost. The standard for grassland compensation is 10 times the \nannual average output value of the land over the past 3 years. Information on compensation \nstandards and rates have been posted in the village and township offices. The compensation is \npaid directly to the affected households. CNY7,500 was provided to each household for the loss \nof simple animal sheds. The total resettlement budget is estimated at $25,000 equivalent \n(CNY0.2 million). \n \n4.  XHC has agreed to implement additional measures to benefit the local communities, \nincluding: (i) hiring and training of local workers for project construction, (ii) provision of water \nsupply for Bajiaowan village, (iii) allowing access to project facilities (e.g., medical emergency \nfacilities, transportation, electricity supply), (iv) supporting purchases of local supplies and \nservices for the local communities, (v) utilizing local work teams for the upgrading of the existing \nroad, and (vi) provision of more reliable electricity supply to three local townships after project \ncompletion. XHC will be responsible for internal monitoring and quarterly reporting. XHC will \nensure compliance with the requirements set out in the RP. The Sunan County Land and \nResources Bureau will conduct regular audits of compensation payments and procedures. \nAnnual audits will be made available to ADB. XHC will also engage an independent monitor \n(e.g., a local sociologist) to investigate resettlement implementation progress and community \ndevelopment issues, and prepare evaluation reports for submission to XHC and ADB every 12 \nmonths  over  the  4-year  project  period  to  assess  whether  affected  households  have  fully \nrestored their incomes and livelihoods, in accordance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. ", "  Appendix 13  47\nLEAST-COST GENERATION PLANNING AND ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Load Forecast \n \n1.  Energy demand forecasts play a key role in generation planning since the level of future \ndemand is one of the critical variables in selecting the least-cost power plant. The load forecast \nperiod for the Gansu network was divided into two terms: short-term (3 years) and long-term (to \nthe end of the system planning period in 2020). \n  \n2.  Short-Term Forecast. A bottom-up approach or sector analysis method was used for \nthe short-term forecast. Different end-use demands\u2014primary (agriculture), secondary (industry \nand  construction),  tertiary  (including  commercial  and  service),  and  residential  (urban and \nrural)\u2014were calculated based on current  economic activities, policies, and  impact of  recent \nmajor construction projects in Gansu province.  \n \n3.  Long-Term Forecast. Three methods\u2014regression, linear time series, and exponential \ntime  series\u2014were  used  for  forecasting  energy  consumption.  The  regression  model  used \nelectricity tariff, gross domestic product, population, industry structure, and energy efficiency as \nindependent variables. The historical data from 1986  to  2001 and the short-term demand \ninformation (2002\u20132004) were all taken as inputs to the regression model. The results are \nsummarized in Table A13.1. The estimates of the exponential time series and regression \nmodels were similar, whereas the linear time series produced a different trend. The analysis \nused the estimate from the regression model and rejected the results from the linear time series.  \n \nTable A13.1: Energy Forecast in Gansu Province \n(gigawatt-hours) \n \nYear  Regression  Linear  Exponent \n2005  40,034  36,530  39,653 \n2006  42,198  37,780  41,883 \n2007  44,598  39,040  44,238 \n2008  47,256  40,290  46,725 \n2009  50,198  41,540  49,353 \n2010  53,451  42,800  52,128 \n2011  56,277  44,050  55,059 \n2012  59,351  45,300  58,155 \n2013  62,694  46,560  61,424 \n2014  66,330  47,810  64,878 \n2015  70,285  49,060  68,526 \n2016  73,680  50,320  72,379 \n2017  77,311  51,570  76,449 \n2018  81,194  52,830  80,748 \n2019  85,347  54,080  85,288 \n2020  89,788  55,330  90,083 \n      Source: Gansu Provincial Government; Staff estimates. \n \n4.  Analysis of Power Balance. Electricity demand in the northwest network is expected to \ngrow at 7% and 6.4% in the 10th and 11th Five-Year planning periods (2001\u20132005 and 2006\u2013\n2010), respectively. Similarly, energy demand growth in Gansu province is expected to be 6.0% \nand 5.7% for the same period. The Xiliushi and Xiaogushan hydropower stations are the two \nproposed hydropower plants on Heihe river expected to start producing power around 2005 to \n2007. The energy balance in Zhangye, including the generation from Xillushui and Xiaogushan, \nis shown in Table A13.2.  \n ", "48   Appendix 13 \nTable A13.2: Energy Balance, Zhangye \n(gigawatt-hours) \n \nItem  2005  2006  2010 \n1.

The Zhangye City network has two comparable but distinct peak demand scenarios, \nwinter and summer. The summer peak imposes maximum demand on the existing network. The \nsummer demand is made up of a larger peak mainly due to agricultural (pumped irrigation) load. \nThe Xiaogushan Hydropower  Plant (XHP) will provide maximum generation during summer \nmonths and is particularly suited to alleviate the peak electricity demand gaps in summer for the \nZhangye City network. \n \nB.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n6.  Because of the large gap between demand (1,400\u20132,000 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) and \nsupply (750\u20131,200 GWh) in Zhangye City, demand-side responses were not considered as full \nalternatives in the analysis. Only supply-side options\u2014new generation plants\u2014were used as \nviable options. \n \n7.  Project  Alternatives.  Five  initial  alternatives  using  three  power  generation \ntechnologies\u2014hydropower, coal-fired, and natural-gas-fired\u2014were preliminarily considered for \nselecting viable electricity generation for the province. Three fossil-fuel generation technologies \nwere considered as technology alternatives: coal-fired thermal (small, 300 megawatts [MW] and \nlarge, 600 MW), and combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT, 300 MW). Technology alternatives, \nincluding XHP, were analyzed in detail. Capital and annual operation and maintenance costs for \neach technology alternative were examined. The capital cost used in the analysis excluded \nphysical contingency and taxes. The hydropower and coal-fired power stations were the only \ntwo options that showed a positive net present value (using a 12% discount rate). The larger \nhydropower options were not considered in detail due to project schedule and hydrological \nrestrictions; the CCGT option was dropped due to the lack of natural gas reserves in the project \narea. \n \n8.  For direct comparability the output of each alternative was normalized. Adjustments \nwere also made for load factor differences. It was assumed that aside from the benefit for \ncapacity substitution for XHP, the alternatives would generate more energy (load factor is \naround 68%) to substitute generation from small coal-fired plants. The latter could not be used \nto meet incremental demand, but would save fuel consumption in existing plants, bringing \nenergy saving benefits.  \n \n9.  The equalizing discount rate\u2014the discount at which the present value of two life-cycle \ncost streams are equal, thus indicating a discount rate at which preference changes\u2014shows \nthat hydropower remains a better alternative up to the discount rate of 12.85%, after which \nsmaller thermal power will be preferable. Hydropower, with its high capital costs and very low \noperational cost, is the preferred option when lower discount rates are used.  \n \n10.  Using viable technological options\u2014hydropower and coal-fired plants\u2014a list of feasible \npower plant alternatives was developed subject to the constraints imposed by the environment, ", "  Appendix 13  49\nriver flow, and geography. Various small and medium size hydropower options were considered \n(including few-megawatt small hydropower stations up to large stations such as the 1,400 MW \nHeishanxia station). The development sequence for these hydropower candidates before 2010 \nhas been designated as fixed schemes due to  their being either under construction or there \nhaving been other development purposes (e.g., flood control and water supply). The XHP is the \nonly candidate for power expansion in the period up to 2010 and others except fixed ones will be \navailable after 2010 (Table A13.3).  \n \nTable A13.3: Identified Feasible Alternatives to Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant \n \nCoal-Fired Thermal  Capacity, MW  Committed Period \n  Pingliang Planta  600  2003\u20132004 \n  300MW Thermal  300  2004\u20132011 \n  600MW Thermal  600  2012\u20132020 \nHydropower     \n  Liujiaxia Expansiona  300  2006\u20132007 \n  Xiaoxiaa  230  2005\u20132006 \n  Jiudianxiaa  240  2008\u20132009 \n  Heishanxiaa  1,400  2010\u20132013 \n  Xiliushuia  157  2005\u20132006 \n  New Wind Farm and Small Hydropowera  162  2002\u20132005 \nXHP  98  2006\u20132007 \n  Qilinsi  113  2020 \n  Other L&M Hydropower  1,000  2016\u20132020 \nL&M = large and medium sized, MW = megawatt, XHP = Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant. \na  Small Hydropower includes  XHP (98 MW).  \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \n11.  Identifying  the  Least-cost  Option.  The  Generation  Expansion  System  Planning \n(GESP) II model was used to identify the least-cost alternative generation option from the list of \nfeasible alternatives based on the demand forecast for the Gansu power system. The least-cost \nanalyses confirmed the robustness of XHC. The GESP II model optimized (minimized cost) the \nobjective function total system cost to meet power demand within the defined reliability criteria. \nThe planning period used was 2002 to 2020 and in order to reflect the operation characteristics \nof expansion candidates sufficiently, the study period was expanded to 2050. The technical and \neconomic indices of the power system from 2021 to 2050 were assumed to be the same as \nthose in 2020. \n \n12.  The optimization model simulated power exchange between Gansu and other provinces \nas additional power plants (power import) or load demand (power export). Three  hydrologic \nconditions were considered: average with 80% probability, wet with 10% probability, and dry \nwith 10% probability. The production simulation was carried out for all hydrological conditions. \nThe least-cost analysis used the weighted average operations cost based on the probabilities in \nthe objective function. The forecast annual load curve was modeled using three seasons: wet \nseason (April to September), average season (October to December), and dry season (January \nto March). Based on the historic data, the system peak was modeled in the dry season. The \nfixed system included existing power plants, under construction or decided generation plants, \nretirement plan of generation units, and power exchanges with other power grids. The GESP \nmodel identified the 98 MW XHP as the least-cost alternative for generation expansion in Gansu \nprovince.  \n \nC.  Conclusions \n \n13.  The major conclusions of the least-cost analysis are: (i) gas-fired combined cycle is not \nviable, small hydropower and small to medium  coal-fired power stations are technologically \nviable  alternatives  for  generation  in  Gansu;  and  (ii)  the  98  MW  XHC  was  the  least-cost \nalternative for generation expansion.  ", "50   Appendix 14 \nECONOMIC ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Estimation of Costs \n \n1.  Economic costs are at 2003 prices and are expressed in domestic currency. Tradable \ncommodities  were  valued  at  border  prices  at  the  prevailing  exchange  rate.  Nontradable \ncommodities were valued through shadow prices using a standard conversion factor of 0.93, and \nspecific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for steel, 0.76 for cement, 0.82 for timber, 2.0 \nfor skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. The capital costs were also adjusted to eliminate \nprice inflation, interest during construction, and taxes. \n \nB.  Estimation of Benefits \n \n2.  The main benefit of the Project is power generation to meet  the electricity demand in \nZhangye City. Analysis used conservative estimates of the actual  benefits\u2014lower forecast for \ngeneration, plant use of 1%, and transmission losses of 3%, formed the basis for the incremental \nnet energy supply from the  Xiaogushan Hydropower  Plant (XHP). XHP, with its 98-megawatt \n(MW) installed capacity, is assumed to generate about 366 gigawatt-hours (GWh) per year, which \nrepresents about 43% load factor or an average load of 42 MW. The quantification of incremental \nbenefits was based on end-users\u2019 willingness-to-pay (WTP). \n \n3.  Economic benefit was calculated using a linear and a semilog electricity demand function. \nThe estimate using a semilog demand function was lower than the linear method, which assumes \nthat 50% of the price difference represents consumer surplus. Consumer surplus\u2014the difference \nbetween what one is willing to pay for a commodity and the amount one is actually required to \npay\u2014was estimated as CNY0.63/kilowatt-hours (kWh) using a semilog function.1 The WTP for \nthe Project was calculated by deducting the incremental cost of distribution and transmission. A \nbenchmark figure of CNY0.16/kWh was used as an estimate for the incremental transmission and \ndistribution cost. The final result of CNY0.47/kWh was used for all economic benefit calculations.  \n \nC.  Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n4.  The basis for project evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the with-\nproject (base) case and the without-project (alternative) case. The project analysis period is 24 \nyears following expected full operation by 2008. The project construction period is 4 years \ncommencing in 2004 to the end of 2007. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was \ncalculated at 23.4%, indicating that XHC is economically viable (Table A14.1).  \n \n5.  A complete quantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project was not possible \ndue to various factors including time and resources. Thus,  the total benefits estimated in this \nanalysis can be interpreted as conservative estimates. There are large positive environmental \nbenefits from the avoided pollution from an alternative energy source (a coal-fired thermal power \nplant). Among these environmental benefits, the most prominent ones are: improved human \nhealth from avoided morbidity and mortality from fine particulates, improved human welfare due \nto improved visibility and reduced materials damage from avoided air pollution, and positive \nimpacts on environmental resources due to avoided emission of carbon dioxide. The analysis \nalso excludes quantification of economic costs  and benefits from the rural electrification, and \ninstitutional strengthening components. \n \n                                                 \n1  ERD Technical Note 3, p. 8.

The \nquantification of costs and benefits shows that overall economic benefits outweigh costs. Crucial \nin the quantification of benefits was estimating incremental energy supply and consumers\u2019 WTP \nfor  those  benefits.  Consumer  surplus  was  calculated  based  on  a  linear  electricity  demand \nfunction. This method assumes 50% of the price difference represents consumer surplus. The \nestimated consumer surplus was CNY0.63/kWh using a semilog function.  The WTP for the \nProject was calculated by deducting the incremental cost of distribution and transmission of \nCNY0.16/kWh from CNY0.63/kWh. The final result  of CNY0.47/kWh was used as the  WTP \nthroughout the document.  \n \n9.  Based on the economic analysis, it was estimated that the Project\u2019s net present value is \nCNY392 million. The quantification was based on the WTP2 and a gross energy generation of \n366 GWh less annualized capital and maintenance costs. The analysis yields a base case EIRR \nof 23.4%. Sensitivity and risk analysis shows that the EIRR is robust. An economic evaluation of \nlocal environmental impacts was also undertaken and it improved the EIRR to 24.8%.  The \nanalysis  concludes  that  XHC  is  not  only  the  least-cost  alternative  but  is  also  justifiable  in \neconomic terms. \n                                                 \n2  In real, 2003 terms.

Xiaogushan Hydropower Company (XHC) was established in December 2001 and it is \nfully responsible for implementing the Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant (XHP) component of the \nProject. Financial analysis evaluates the commercial viability of XHP and is focused primarily on \nXHC as the implementing agency (IA). Detailed financial analysis is found in Supplementary \nAppendix K. Prices in dollar terms are assumed to increase in accordance with international \ninflation forecasts of 2.0% per year; and prices in local currency are expected to increase by \n1.5% in 2003 and 2004, and by 2.5% from 2005. Exchange rates were used to convert the \nfuture CNY/kilowatt-hours (kWh) tariff in equivalent $/kWh terms and the rates reflect the \ndifferential inflation between foreign and local currency. \n \nB.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n2.  The estimated costs for the XHP component, including physical and price contingencies \nand capitalized financial charges during development are $87 million. The Government has \nrequested a loan of $35 million (40.2% of the total project cost) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the balance will be financed by loan from Bank of China and equity capital. For \nthe ADB loan a long-term interest rate of 4.5%\u2014although the current London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR) rates are lower\u2014is used for the analysis. The loan will have a 24-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 4 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of \n0.5%, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe Government will relend the proceeds of the ADB loan to XHC through the Gansu Provincial \nGovernment and Zhangye City Government in the same currency and on the same terms and \nconditions  as  the  ADB  loan  to  the  Government.  The  equity  holders  for  XHC\u2014Hei  He \nHydropower Development Company, Zhangye Water and Power Bureau, and Gansu Yinlong \nConstruction Company\u2014will finance about $14 million equivalent in local currency cost. Bank of \nChina will cofinance $38 million. Analysis assumes long-term interest of 5.76% over a 15-year \nterm for the Bank of China loans.

Tariff Methodology \n \n3.  Although in the short to medium term, the provincial pricing bureau is likely to decide on \nthe price the provincial government would pay for the energy purchased from XHC, in the longer \nterm XHC would sell its electricity through bilateral contracts and in the competitive wholesale \nelectricity market where prices will be decided though competition with other market players. A \nreasonable efficient level of cost structure and fair return on investment can only be used as a \nproxy to assess the longer term competitive market price for electricity. \n \n4.  Using a revenue requirement approach, the hydropower generation tariff was calculated \nas CNY0.26/kWh.1 About 1.2% risk premium was added to the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) to reflect a more realistic financial opportunity cost of capital. The reasonable level of \nrevenue requirement for XHC, in a typical year, is calculated using: a return on asset of 5.73%, \ndepreciation of 3.75%, no new investment or capital expenditure, operation and maintenance \nexpenses of about CNY12.4 million, and an average tax level of CNY10.7 million.  A tariff of \nCNY0.26/kWh is the minimum threshold required to recover the opportunity cost of CNY91.4 \nmillion per year from sales of 351 GWh of electricity to be sold by XHC. In light of these \ncalculations, the proposed tariff of CNY0.29/kWh by the Executing Agency is considered high \nand on a conservative note, a long-term tariff of CNY0.26/kWh is used in the analysis.  \n \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n5.  The net cash flows during the lifetime of the Project are discounted at the financial \nopportunity cost of capital to show a project\u2019s worth in financial terms. The WACC is used as a \nproxy for the financial opportunity cost of the Project, which is generally used to evaluate the \nfinancial viability of ADB projects. The WACC represents a weighted average of the different \nreturns (interests) paid to the various source of funds for the Project. The calculation of WACC \nis based on the financing plans shown in Table A15.2 and it applies only to the Project. After \nadjustment for the corporate rate of 33% for tax deductibility of interest payments, and for the \nlocal inflation projection of 2.5%, the post-tax real WACC is calculated as 4.53%. \n \n6.  ADB guidelines on financial management require that the real cost of capital for each \ncomponent should be at least 4% and where a financing component fails the minimum rate test, \nthe derived value should be replaced with 4%. For example, the domestic loan component with \n5.76% interest\u2014became 1.32% after adjusted for tax at 33%\u2014fails the minimum rate test of \n4%. The derived value was replaced with 4%. The WACC would be 2.98% without the minimum \nrate test.  \n \nE.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n7.  Financial internal rate of return (FIRR) measures the viability of a project. Table A15.2 \npresents the XHP\u2019s component\u2019s receipts, payments, and net cash flows for the full project \nperiod (24 years) where it is assumed that the receipts and payments will remain constant in \nreal terms once a steady state is reached. The present value of net benefits becomes zero at a \ndiscount rate of 7.5%, which is the FIRR for the Project. Since the cash flows in  the FIRR \ncalculation are post-tax, the FIRR is compared against the post-tax WACC of 4.53%. Since the \nFIRR is higher than WACC, the XHC component is financially viable. Sensitivity analysis shows \nthat subjected to adverse conditions, the FIRR remains robust (Table A15.3). \n \n                                                 \n1  A discussion of electricity tariffs and tariff reforms is found in Appendix 16. \n ", "  Appendix 15  55\nTable A15.2: Financial Internal Rate of Return for XHC \n(CNY million) \n   \nItem  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2015  2020  2028 \nReceipts                     \nGross Energy Generation (GWh)  \u2014  \u2014  90  366  366  366  366  348  348  330 \nNet Energy Generation (GWh)  \u2014  \u2014  86  351  351  351  351  334  334  316 \nTariff (CNY/kWh)  0.26  0.26  0.26  0.26  0.26  0.25  0.25  0.25  0.23  0.23 \nTotal Receiptsa      22.2  90.1  90.1  85.6  85.6  81.4  77.1  73.0 \nPayments                     \nProject Cost  95.4  254.3  222.5  63.6  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014 \nOperation and Maintenance Cost  \u2014  \u2014  8.2  10.4  11.0  12.4  12.4  12.4  12.4  12.4 \nTotal Payments  95.4  254.3  230.7  74.0  11.0  12.4  12.4  12.4  12.4  12.4 \nTax  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  4.6  4.0  4.3  10.7  12.8  13.6 \nNet Cash Flow after Tax  (95.4) (254.3) (208.5)  16.1  74.5  69.2  68.9  58.2  51.9  47.0 \n                    \nFIRR = 7.5%   \n                  \nCNY = yuan, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, GWh = gigawatt-hour, kWh = kilowatt-hour, \u2014 = not available.  \na  Net of city maintenance and education-added taxes. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \nTable A15.3: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nSensitivity Analysis of FIRR  Change in Variable  FIRR (%) \n     \nBase Case    7.5 \n(i)  Capital Cost Overrun  10%  6.3 \n(ii)  Energy Sales Reduction  (10%)  5.7 \n(iii)  Implementation Delay  1 year  6.0 \n(iv)  Combination of (i) and (ii)    4.6 \n(v)  Combination of (i) and (iii)    5.0 \n(vi)  Tariff Reduction  (10%)  5.7 \n(vii)  CNY (Exchange Rate) Depreciation  10%  6.9 \nCNY = yuan, FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Staff estimates. \n ", " 56 Appendix 16 \nELECTRICITY TARIFF AND TARIFF ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Regulatory Reform and Tariff  \n \n1.  Currently the Gansu Provincial Price Bureau (GPPB) is the tariff approval authority for all \npower  generating  plants  in  Gansu  Province.  This  bureau  administratively  reports  to  the \nprovincial government and follows the guidelines from the State Price Bureau. The GPPB \napproves the tariff based on actual costs at the final stage of a project, before actual generation. \nBased on estimated cost figures, it gives agreements (in principle) on the estimated tariff at the \nfeasibility stage. The current mode of tariff approval will be changed with the introduction of \ncompetition, and changes have already been initiated at the national level. \n \nB.  Subsidies in Electricity Tariff  \n \n2.  GPPB  intends  to  establish  cost  reflective  tariffs  in  most  cases,  and  tariffs  for  both \ngenerator and end-user reflects that intention. However, cross subsidies exist between end-user \ncategories,  e.g.,  commercial  consumers  subsidize  agricultural  consumers.  Average  tariffs  in \nGansu are shown in Table A16.1. Tariffs have increased over the 1993\u20132000 period. Agricultural \ntariffs had the lowest increase compared to all other end-user categories. In 1997, 1998, and 1999 \nthe Gansu Province average electricity tariffs of CNY0.249 kilowatt per hour (kWh), 0.260, and \n0.262 were lower than the national average electricity tariff of 0.341, 0.353, and 0.356.1 Gansu \nprovince electricity tariffs are also generally lower than the North-West Power Network average \nelectricity tariff. The average tariff in  Zhangye City in 2001 was 0.216/kWh (A detailed tariff \nanalysis is given in Supplementary Appendix M).  \n3.  It is important to note that the price for generation by Xiaogushan Hydropower Company \n(XHC)\u2014CNY0.26/kWh\u2014is higher than the overall average tariff in the Zhangye City. It is only \npossible because the cost of generation from other old generators in the Province is significantly \nlower, making the weighted average cost of generation much lower. CNY0.26/kWh is the least-\ncost option for new generation in the Province. This indicates, that in the medium to longer term, \nwith retirement of older plants and addition of newer plants, the prices in Zhangye City will be \nincreased unless it receives direct subsidy from the province. Rural tariffs are generally higher \nthan  average  tariffs  due  to  their  distances  from  the  distribution  substations.  The  power \ndistribution company decides the tariff in a particular rural township by adding the cost of \nserving these consumers and the purchase price of electricity from the network. \n \nTable A16.1: Tariffs in Rural Town \n(CNY/kWh) \n \nTown*  Commercial  Industry  Residence   Agriculture/Irrigation \nAnyang  0.84  0.53  0.538  0.538 \nHuazhai  0.57  0.69  0.530  0.530 \nXidong  0.84  0.62  0.530  0.270 \nGanjun  0.84  0.62  0.530  0.270 \nLongqu  0.84  none  0.750  0.750 \nXishui  none  none  0.980  No pump irrigation \nCNY = yuan, kWh kilowatt-hour. \n* Selected towns only. \nSource: Staff estimates \n                                                 \n1  Based on statistics from the State Power Company  (Electric Power Industry in China Yearbooks of 1999 and \n  2000). ", "  Appendix 16  57\nC.  Building Block Approach for Tariff Calculation  \n \n4.  A common method used by regulators to assess tariffs of monopoly assets is known as \nthe building block method. This involves the addition of the various costs of a business to \ncalculate revenue required for a business to be viable, and division by forecast quantities to \ncalculate tariffs. The key components of the building blocks approach are: return on assets; \ndepreciation; operation and maintenance expenses; and taxation\u2014when post-tax Weighted \nAverage Cost of Capital (WACC) is used for Return on Assets. \n \n5.  Return on Assets. It is the total return required for the asset to meet the investor\u2019s \nopportunity cost, usually measured as the asset value times the cost of capital. Cost of capital is \ncalculated by adding the cost of debt and cost of equity with the respective weights or use of \nWACC. \n \n6.  Return of Assets. It is the proportion of assets used for production of goods and \nservices in the year, or depreciation. It is calculated by dividing historical asset value by the life \nof an asset. For XHC, a depreciation rate of 3.75%. \n \n7.  Operation and Maintenance Cost. A benchmark figure of CNY0.03/kWh (excluding \ndepreciation) was used, which is consistent to similar projects. Considering the remoteness of \nthe project area, adjustments were made in certain components of the operation costs.  \n \n8.  Taxation. Analysis used a post-tax WACC for return on assets. No allowances were \nmade for tax in the calculation, so it is added separately in the building block approach to \ncalculate revenue requirement. \n \nD.  Proposed Tariffs for Xiaogushan Hydropower Plant \n \n9.  At the feasibility stage projects are screened on the basis of cost estimates and the \nacceptable unit price range is CNY 7,000\u201310,000 per kilowatt (kW). Xiaogushan Hydropower \nPlant with about 8,200 CNY/kW project cost, and CNY0.26/kWh proposed tariff, is consistent \nwith recently approved tariffs of similar types of power projects in the region. The proposed tariff \nof CNY0.26/kWh is in 2003 prices. It is assumed that the generation tariff will be reduced by 5% \n(real terms) in 2009 and by 10% from 2019 onwards. This gradual reduction in price and volume \nis  used  to  model  the  risk  resulting  from  likely  competition  from  other  generators  once \ncompetition is introduced and the energy sector is deregulated.  ", "58   Appendix 17 \nSOCIAL AND POVERTY ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Poverty Analysis  \n \n1.  Poverty Profile of Project Area. Of Zhangye City\u2019s 1.25 million population, almost 80% \nare classified as rural. Of its rural population, 293,000 or almost 30% have incomes less than \nthe national rural poverty line of CNY1,100. Using the lower range of provincial estimates it is \nestimated that 17,000 can be classified as poor. Details of poverty incidence in Zhangye City \ncan be found in Supplementary Appendix N.  \n \n2.  Causes of Poverty. In the farming areas of Zhangye City, the main causes of poverty \nare related to low farm productivity, lack of supplemental income sources, and lack of education. \nThis is aside from the harsh natural conditions, which includes high altitude  that limits the \ngrowing season to 80\u2013170 frost-free days allowing only one field crop per year; poor soils and \nlow rainfall; and inadequate irrigation. Many farmers have unreliable gravity irrigation and \ncannot use electricity to pump water from either an irrigation canal or from an aquifer of \neconomic depth resulting in  lower and less stable yields.  Herder communities face similar \nissues of low productivity, lack of supplemental income sources, and lack of education.  \n \n3.  Rural Electricity Services and Household Consumption. Rural areas in Zhangye City \nface regular load shedding. During power shortages, remote rural areas, which are generally \nserviced through 10-kilovolt distribution lines, are cut off first. Xishui township, where the project \nis located, had power outages for 70 days in 2001 due to load shedding. The power outages \ngenerally last one or two days. Outages result in electricity being unavailable during critical \nperiods of the growing season, according to farmers. Low voltages prevent the usage of \nsensitive appliances, motors, and equipment (e.g., x-ray machines in clinics) or may damage \nequipment due to voltage fluctuations. Extra cost is required for voltage stabilizers. The average \nelectricity consumption of poor households is generally very low. \n \nB.  Social Issues \n \n4.  Ethnic Minorities There are 32 ethnic minorities in Zhangye City accounting for 2.1% of \nZhangye\u2019s total population. The largest groups are Yugur (37.1%), Zang/Tibetan (36.6%), and \nHui (15.9%), with the rest of the minorities constituting less than 10% of the total. Three-fourths \nof ethnic minorities in Zhangye City are in Sunan, the only Yugur autonomous county in the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. The nationalities directly affected by the project are the Zang in \nMati district and the Yugur in neighboring districts, all located in Sunan county. The Xiaogushan \nHydropower Plant construction will have very localized impacts on two villages in Xishui. The \nlocal community will benefit economically from its proximity to the construction activities and \nlater  powerhouse  operation.  The  Xishui  township  government  is  formulating  a  community \ndevelopment strategy and plans1 to ensure that the economic benefits from the Project can be \nproperly managed in a manner to strengthen the local communities in harmony with traditional \nvalues and customs. The strategy and plan was developed in a participatory manner with the \naffected villagers. \n \n5.  Resettlement. A short resettlement plan (RP) has been prepared by the Xiaogushan \nHydropower Company (XHC), a summary of which is found in Appendix 12. The RP is based on \nthe preliminary design study and consultations with local officials, village leaders, and affected \nhouseholds. A formal grassland acquisition compensation agreement was signed in March 2001 \nbetween XHC and Xishui township. Two households affected by the Project have already been \n                                                 \n1  The draft community development strategy and plan was submitted to ADB on 1 April 2003. ", "    Appendix 17  59\ncompensated for the loss of grassland acquired for the preparatory works on the Project. XHC \nhas finalized the short RP based on consultation with Xishui township and affected villages.2  \n \n6.  Affordability. Electricity is an expensive commodity for the poor. In the project area, the \ntypical consumption of electricity for rural households ranges from 10 kilowatt-hours (kWh) to 26 \nkWh per month, mostly used for lighting. Such consumption rates would cost CNY50\u2013300 per \nyear, which represents 2\u201310% of the household\u2019s net income. Use of electricity for groundwater \nirrigation is growing. However, the groundwater is deep (150 to 400 meters) and thus expensive \nto pump, especially with low agricultural prices. Consequently, there has been political pressure \nto subsidize electricity prices for farmers, and irrigation in particular. Even at subsidized tariffs, \naffordability is a serious issue for the farmers in general, and poor households in particular. \n \n7.  Community  Enhancement  Measures.  XHC  is  considering  implementing additional \nmeasures to benefit local communities, including: (i) hiring and training local workers for project \nconstruction, (ii) provision of water supply for Baojiawan village, (iii) allowing access to project \nfacilities (e.g., medical emergency facilities, transportation, electricity supply), (iv) supporting \npurchases of local supplies and services for the local communities, (v) utilizing local work teams \nfor the upgrading of the existing road, and (vi) provision of more reliable electricity supply to \nthree local townships after project completion. These would all result in positive social benefits. \n \nC.   Poverty Reduction Benefits \n \n8.  The project will provide poverty reduction benefits through improved electricity supply for \nthe poor, cleaner energy, and employment opportunities during project construction and after \ncompletion due to increased economic development in the project area. The poverty impact \nratio was calculated at 42% (Table A17). \n \nTable A17: Poverty Impact Ratio \n \nDistribution of  Financial  Economic        Government/    \nProject Effects  Returns  Returns  Difference  Consumers  Economy  Labor \nOutput (Revenues/Benefits)  1,001  1,957   956  956 \nInvestment Cost  (572)  (532)  40    38  2 \nOperating Cost  (169)  (142)  26    13  13 \nTax  (102)    102    102   \nTotal  158  1,283  1,125  956  153  15 \n        \n         Government/     \nBeneficiaries      Consumers  Economy  Labor  Total \nNEB-NFB      956  135  34  1,125 \nFinancial Return        158    388 \nBenefits      956  293  34  1,513 \nProportion to Poor      48%  55%  43%   \nBenefits to Poor      457  161  14  632 \nPoverty Impact Ratio            42% \nSource: Staff estimates. \n                                                 \n2  The final RP was submitted to ADB on 28 April 2003.
