Facilitation of the cross-border movement of goods, vehicles, and people between and \namong the countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is a priority initiative under the \nGMS  economic  cooperation  program.  It  supports  the  GMS  program\u2019s  strategic  thrusts  of \nenhancing  connectivity,  promoting  competitiveness,  and  engendering  a  greater  sense  of \ncommunity. Cross-border transport facilitation enhances connectivity by maximizing the benefits \nderived from subregional transport infrastructure in terms of increased trade and investment. \nImproved efficiency resulting from the easier flow of goods and people across borders promotes \nthe competitiveness of participating countries, individually and as a subregion. A greater sense \nof  community  is  fostered  directly  through  the  harmonization  of  rules  and  procedures,  and \nincreased interaction between and among the peoples of the subregion.   \n2.  At the Second GMS Summit held in Kunming, the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in \nJuly 2005, the GMS leaders were \u201cencouraged by the considerable progress in negotiating the \nannexes  and  protocols  of  the  Cross-Border  Transport  Agreement  (CBTA)  and  the \ncommencement of its implementation.\u201d They further reaffirmed their commitment \u201cto move with \nspeed and purpose to implement the Agreement at an increasing number of border crossings.\u201d \nThe proposed technical assistance (TA) has been requested by the GMS countries to support \ntheir  efforts  to  facilitate  cross-border  transport  and  trade  in  the  subregion  through  the \naccelerated implementation of the CBTA at key border crossings. The TA will complement the \nGMS Strategic Framework for Action on Trade Facilitation and Investment, which will enhance \nthe benefits of the CBTA through a comprehensive set of measures to facilitate trade. Fact-\nfinding for the TA was conducted in September 2005. The TA design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The CBTA is a comprehensive multilateral instrument that covers relevant aspects of \ncross-border transport and trade facilitation, including (i) single-stop/single-window inspection, \n(ii) cross-border movement of persons, (iii) transit traffic, (iv) arrangements to enable transport \noperators  to  undertake  cross-border  transport,  and  (v)  exchange  of  traffic  rights  between \ncountries. Assisted by ADB2, the CBTA was formulated, signed, and ratified by all six GMS \ngovernments, and 16 of its 20 implementing annexes and protocols3 have also been signed to \ndate.   \n4.  Implementation of the CBTA is expected to mitigate key nonphysical barriers to the \nefficient  cross-border movement  of  goods,  vehicles,  and  people in  the  GMS.  The  barriers \ninclude (i) restrictions on the entry of motor vehicles, which result in costly and time-consuming \ntransshipment; (ii) inconsistent and difficult border crossing formalities and procedures related to \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 8 April 2005. \n2  ADB. 1996.

Manila (TA 5686, approved on 29 May 1996, for $180,000).; ADB. \n1997. Technical Assistance to the Greater Mekong Subregion for the Cross-Border Movement of Goods and \nPeople. Manila (TA 5749, approved on 26 August 1997, for $550,000).; ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the \nGreater Mekong Subregion for Facilitating the Cross-Border Movement of Goods and People.

Manila (TA 6098, approved on 9 April 2003, for $800,000). \n3  Seventeen annexes and three protocols had been prepared to provide the operational details needed to implement \nthe CBTA. While the annexes and protocols form an integral part of the CBTA, each of them has to be signed and \nratified by GMS governments to allow its implementation.  ", "2   \ncustoms,  immigration,  and  quarantine  inspections;  and  (iii)  multistep  and  uncoordinated \nprocessing of goods, vehicles, and people at border checkpoints. The CBTA implementation is \nan  integral  component  in  the  transformation  of  the  GMS  road  corridors  into  full-fledged \neconomic corridors.  \n5.  Memoranda of understanding (MOUs) for CBTA implementation have been finalized for \n7 of the 15 key border crossings in the GMS covered by the CBTA. These are the Dansavanh \n(Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic [Lao PDR])-Lao Bao (Viet Nam), Mukdahan (Thailand)-\nSavannakhet (Lao PDR), and Mae Sot (Thailand)-Myawaddy (Myanmar) border crossings along \nthe  East-West  Economic  Corridor;  the  Bavet  (Cambodia)-Moc  Bai  (Viet  Nam)  and \nAranyaprathet (Thailand)-Poipet (Cambodia) border crossings along the Southern Economic \nCorridor; and the Mae Sai (Thailand)-Tachilek (Myanmar) and Hekou (PRC)-Lao Cai (Viet Nam) \nborder crossings along the North-South Economic Corridor. The MOUs include a time-bound \naction  plan  for  self-executing  articles 4   of  the  CBTA,  commitments  to  expedite  the \nimplementation of annexes and protocols following their ratification, and interim measures for \nimportant procedures, such as the bilateral exchange of traffic rights, until such time that the \nrelevant annexes and/or protocols are ratified by GMS governments. Implementation of the \nCBTA began on 30 June 2005 at the Dansavanh-Lao Bao border crossing, will begin by 31 \nDecember 2005 at the Mukdahan-Savannakhet and Aranyaprathet-Poipet border crossings, \nand by 30 June 2006 at the other 4 key border crossings.  \n6.  Discussions with GMS officials and other stakeholders during the preparations for the \nCBTA  implementation  at  the  key  border  crossings  during  the  period  September  2004\u2013\nSeptember 2005, revealed constraints to the full, immediate, and sustainable implementation of \nthe CBTA. The constraints include (i) the need to harmonize the GMS countries\u2019 relevant laws \nand/or regulations with the provisions of the annexes and protocols; (ii) the absence of a critical \nmass of technical capacity among relevant officials at the border crossings; and (iii) the limited \ninstitutional capacity at the central Government level.  \n7.  Major challenges for effective implementation of the CBTA include (i) establishment of \nefficient  management  systems  and  associated  capacity  building;  (ii)  streamlining  and \nharmonization of border control documents; (iii) preparation of revised manuals of operation at \nthe border checkpoints and associated training; (iv) establishment of required infrastructure, \nand, in some cases, relocation and/or modification of layouts of border checkpoints as well as \nprovision of common control areas to allow single-stop inspection and single-window inspection; \nand (v) mitigation of negative externalities associated with increased cross-border movement. \nSuccessful implementation of the CBTA at the key border crossings would encourage GMS \ngovernments to ratify the annexes and protocols and, thus, accelerate full implementation of the \nCBTA subregionwide. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  Overall, the TA is expected to contribute to rapid and sustainable economic growth \nresulting from increased trade and investment. The TA\u2019s expected outcomes are (i) increased \ncross-border trade at border crossings covered by the CBTA; (ii) reduced nonphysical barriers \nto the cross-border movement of goods, vehicles, and people; and (iii) improved capacity for \nsustainable implementation of the CBTA. The expected outputs of the proposed TA are (i) \n                                                 \n4  Implementation of a self-executing article of the CBTA does not require the entry into force of an annex or protocol. ", "  3\nshortened border crossing clearance times at key border crossings; (ii) finalized arrangements \nfor  CBTA  implementation  at  a  second  set  of  border  crossings;  (iii)  recommendations  to \nmaximize  benefits  and  address  limitations  of  the  implementation  of  the  CBTA;  and  (iv) \nstrengthened National Transport Facilitation Committees (NTFCs).5  The activities of the TA will \ncover all six GMS countries6. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  CBTA  Implementation  at  Key  Border  Crossings. Consistent with the time-bound \nMOUs  for  CBTA  implementation  at  the  seven  key  border  crossings,  the  TA  supports  the \nfollowing measures: (i) harmonizing, simplifying, and rationalizing forms and procedures, and \npreparing manuals for efficient border management consistent with related international (e.g., \nWorld Customs Organization [WCO]) and regional (e.g., Association of Southeast Asian Nations \n[ASEAN])  agreements,  including  translation  of  forms,  procedures,  and  manuals  into  the \nrespective  local  languages;  (ii)  identifying  the  information  and  communication  technology/ \nmanagement information system (ICT/MIS) requirements including the facilitation of pre-arrival \nclearance  procedures,  taking  into  account  ICT/MIS  provided  by  other  external  aid/funding \nagencies; (iii) facilitating the implementation of the single-window system prescribed under the \nASEAN Customs Cooperation initiatives; (iv) providing limited ICT equipment and software at \nselected border checkpoints, where such are urgently needed to facilitate the establishment of \nan  electronically  transmitted  declaration  system;  (v)  conducting  a  study  on  modern  border \nmanagement systems and recommending its implementation; (vi) conducting location-specific \ntraining/capacity-building  activities,  including  preparation  of  manuals,  guidelines  and \nprocedures,  and  instructional  media;  (vii)  conducting  \u201cbefore\u201d  and  \u201cafter\u201d  border  crossing \nclearance time studies and compiling relevant cross-border statistics to assess the effectiveness \nof facilitation measures; and (viii) monitoring the implementation of, and facilitating compliance \nwith, the time-bound arrangements for CBTA implementation and advising the NTFCs and/or \nline agencies of the status of compliance. \n10.  Arrangements for CBTA Implementation at a Second Set of Border Crossings. The \nTA will support the preparation and finalization of arrangements for implementing the CBTA at a \nsecond set of border crossings. The TA will provide assistance in (i) drafting bilateral time-\nbound MOUs for CBTA implementation at each of the second set of border crossings to be \nconsidered and endorsed by the Ministerial Joint Committee (JC);7 (ii) facilitating meetings to \nnegotiate and finalize the MOUs; (iii) identifying and facilitating the provision of requirements for \nestablishing  an  effective  border  management  system  and  implementing  single-window \ninspection  and  single-stop  inspection  for  each  border  crossing;  and  (iv)  monitoring  the \nimplementation  of  the  MOUs,  and  advising  NTFCs  and/or  line  agencies  on  the  status  of \ncompliance.  \n11.  Effective and Sustainable Implementation of the CBTA. The TA will assist in (i) \nstrengthening  the  existing  institutional  mechanisms  within  each  country  (i.e.,  NTFCs)  and \namong countries (i.e., JC and its subcommittees8); (ii) reviewing the structure of NTFCs, the JC \n                                                 \n5  NTFC is a permanent body established in all GMS countries and chaired by a minister or vice-minister. It brings \ntogether representatives of all agencies concerned with the implementation of the CBTA. \n6  GMS countries include Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam. \n7  The Ministerial Joint Committee (JC) is a standing body established to monitor and assess the functioning of the \nCBTA. It is composed of the chairpersons of NTFCs in the six GMS countries. \n8  Under  the  JC,  subcommittees  on  customs,  immigration,  health/sanitary,  phytosanitary,  and  transport  were \nestablished  to  (i)  discuss  implementation-related  issues  on  the  respective  thematic  areas,  and  (ii)  make \nrecommendations to the JC on how to resolve these issues. ", "4   \nand its subcommittees, and make recommendations for their operationalization; (iii) examining \nkey outstanding issues in the CBTA\u2019s contents and its annexes and protocols; (iv) measuring \nthe benefits of improved cross-border transport facilitation, through \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d studies; \n(v) disseminating information about CBTA implementation to the public and private sectors, \nincluding at the border areas; and (vi) providing coordination/secretariat support to the JC, its \nsubcommittees, and NTFCs.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA will cost about $860,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates and the financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional \nCooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund, funded by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China in an amount not exceeding $400,000, and by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nTA  funding  program  for  $400,000,  both  administered  by  ADB.  The  participating  GMS \ngovernments will provide the remaining $60,000 equivalent in kind, in the form of counterpart \nstaff as well as logistical support.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Operations Coordination Division of \nADB\u2019s Mekong Regional Department will take the lead in the TA implementation. NTFCs in the \nsix GMS countries will serve as focal points for TA implementation. The TA will be implemented \nover 18 months, from March 2006 to August 2007. \n14.  The TA will be carried out by a team of international and domestic consultants to be \nrecruited as individuals in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants.  Individual \ninternational  consultants  with  expertise  in  (i)  trade  facilitation,  (ii)  capacity  building  on \ncustoms/trade facilitation, (iii) transport regulations and international law, and (iv) transport \nfacilitation, will be recruited on an intermittent basis during TA implementation.  10 person-\nmonths  of  international  consulting  services  and  42  person-months  of  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required. The outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 3. To facilitate \nimplementation  at  key  border  crossings,  limited  key  ICT  equipment  will  be  procured  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Procurement and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB \nfor the procurement of equipment.  On completion of the TA, equipment will be transferred to \nthe participating governments. \n15.
