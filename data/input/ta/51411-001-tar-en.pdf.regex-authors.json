INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) seeks to support the Government of Mongolia to enhance \nthe nonbank financial system\u2019s capacity for providing financial access through supporting the \nresolution, rehabilitation, and development of the savings and credit cooperative (SCC) sector.1 \nThe TA is included in the country operations business plan, 2018\u20132020 for Mongolia of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The SCC sector lacks capacity and a development framework to support sustainable \nfinancial inclusion. Mongolia had 290 SCCs in the third quarter of 2017\u2014192 conducting services \nin Ulaanbaatar and 98 operating in rural areas\u2014with a total asset base of MNT142.8 billion. While \nthe SCC sector reflects a nominal portion of the overall bank-dominated financial system in \nMongolia, SCCs in many rural areas are among the primary financial service providers. Further, \nfor lower-income elements of the population and many micro and small enterprises, SCCs are a \nprimary source of financial services in both urban and rural areas. Their capacity to provide \nfinancial services in these selected segments is important to the overall economy and to support \nfinancial access. In 2017, the government approved a program for developing the finance sector \nthrough 2025, including detailed support for the SCC sector.  \n   \n3.  The  Mongolian  Confederation  of  Credit  Unions  (MOCCU)  is  the  major  cooperative \numbrella organization for SCCs, but the Law on Savings and Credit Cooperatives does not require \nSCCs to become a member of MOCCU. The SCC industry is fragmented, as only 63% of its \nactors are MOCCU members and most SCCs operate of their own accord. MOCCU does not \nprovide many needed centralized functions and services to members, as is normally the case with \na league organization. Most SCCs lack the expertise and capacity to manage a sustainable \nbusiness plan effectively. Nonetheless, applications for new SCC licensing have increased. The \nFinancial Regulatory Commission (FRC) is responsible for considering the impact of the new \nentrants on the SCC and nonbank industry. A detailed SCC plan to guide the area does not exist \nto support the concept of financial inclusion by making financial services more accessible to \nunderserved regions. The FRC should assume its mandate as regulator by directing new entrants \ntoward areas in need of services while protecting current SCCs from encroachment. The goal will \nbe to diversify the credit union demographics and avoid the concentration of institutions, which \nwould saturate the market.     \n \n4.  The financial strength of the SCC sector is weak. Through ADB support, the FRC \nembarked on a thorough assessment of each SCC.3 Each supervisor compiled data on their SCC \nportfolio according to templates that included prudential standards and norms. This exercise \naimed to establish the level of risk each SCC is experiencing and rank them against prescribed \nstandards that were established based on international best practices. The result was a list of \ninstitutions that are considered insolvent, risking the integrity of the sector or posing potential \nfinancial losses to their members. The intention was to proceed with a resolution program that \nwould require earmarked insolvent SCCs to provide the FRC with a plan to address their situation \nor to proceed with a merger, liquidation, or delicensing. Based on the FRC\u2019s initial assessment, \nabout 30% of SCCs may need rehabilitation or resolution. Concerns with SCCs arose over time, \nwith many new SCCs created under government programs that were not well-considered. In 2014, \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 October 2018. \n2 ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2018\u20132020. Manila. \n3 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to Mongolia for Supporting Financial Sector Development and Stability. Manila. \n ", "2   \nthe City of Ulaanbaatar created 118 credit unions within the city limits as part of a program to \ndeliver microfinance to small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the city. The City of \nUlaanbaatar provided each credit union with a loan as seed money and the program was \nsuccessful in distributing funds rapidly. However, the assessment and financial review revealed \nthat a large number of credit unions are insolvent, mostly because of nonperforming loans. These \ncity credit unions distributed many loans across the city without proper consideration of their \nfinancial feasibility, but more so under targeted lending objectives of city officials. SCCs provide \nvital financial services in rural areas, but many suffer from a lack of funding and obtain higher-\ncost and unstable loans from banks.   \n \n5.  Many rural SCCs will be subjected to the rehabilitation and resolution because of their \nweak  financial  condition.  While  the  financial  stability  of  SCCs  is  a  concern,  the  sector\u2019s \nrehabilitation is not simply a matter of the resolution of failed entities. Rehabilitation must consider \nthat SCCs in many areas provide core financial services to concentrated parts of the population. \nClosing SCCs can create more concentration in the sector, potential greater weakness in the \nfuture,  and  negatively  impact financial  access.  Rehabilitation must  explore  all methods for \nrehabilitating  the  sector  including  mergers,  reformulation  of  business  plans,  delicensing  of \ninefficient services, and closure. The process must follow a holistic and effective road map to \nimplement the resolution. ADB has supported SCCs in capacity assessment and financial due \ndiligence to support the FRC and MOCCU in providing advisory services to poorly performing \nSCCs. The FRC did not agree to any resolution plan but expressed the need to establish deposit \ninsurance and stabilization funds. Once a rehabilitation and resolution program is implemented \nand the SCC sector is strengthened, the FRC will initiate deposit insurance and stabilization funds. \nADB\u2019s TA for Supporting Financial Sector Development and Stability has assisted in preparing \noperationalization materials and the framework for deposit insurance and stabilization funds.4   \n \n6.  The FRC has limited capacity and weak organization to oversee SCCs and other nonbank \nfinancial institutions (NBFIs) effectively. Its key capacity challenges to support the strengthening \nof  the  nonbank  finance  sector  are  inefficient  operations,  excessive  workload  assigned  to \npersonnel, and a shortage of staff skilled in risk-based supervision. The FRC is not able to attract \nand maintain skilled professional staff, with 70% of staff having less than 5 years of experience.  \nCompensation is not competitive in comparison to other government and private sector options \nin the finance sector. Work is also hampered by a lack of necessary information technology \nhardware and software equipment. Since the FRC\u2019s establishment in 2006, the number of service \nlicenses issued has increased almost nine times to 6,509 while the number of staff has grown \nthreefold to 144. Each SCC supervisor is assigned to 50\u201360 SSCs, each securities supervisor is \nassigned to 60 joint-stock companies and 12 securities companies, each insurance supervisor is \nassigned to four insurance companies and 12 insurance intermediaries, while each nonbank \nsupervisor is assigned to 60\u2013100 NBFIs. The number of institutions continues to grow. As the \nFRC is primarily funded by the government budget, financial constraints pose a significant \nchallenge to overcome institutional concerns. Adding to the workload is the impact from an \noutdated law and regulations governing SCCs and NBFIs (e.g., each NBFI must reapply for \ncontinuance of their service licenses annually).   \n \n7.  While the FRC has adopted risk-based supervision, the concept requires implementation \nand  training  to  obtain  the  full  benefits.  The  organizational  structure  of  the  FRC  remains \nsegregated  between  onsite  and  offsite  oversight  responsibilities,  posing  challenges  to  the \nimplementation of risk-based supervision. FRC supervision of SCCs has aimed to conform with \nthe  Guiding  Principles  for  the  Effective  Prudential  Supervision  of  Cooperative  Financial \n                                                \n4  Ibid footnote 3. \n ", "3 \n \nInstitutions 5  issued  by  the  International  Credit  Union  Regulators\u2019  Network  (ICURN). 6 \nAmendments or a total restructuring of the Law on Savings and Credit Cooperatives are also \nneeded to improve support for the sector. The FRC has set up a drafting committee that is \npreparing a new law on SCCs for submission to Parliament. ADB is supporting the drafting of this \nlaw under the TA for Supporting Financial Sector Development and Stability.    \n \n8.  As of the third quarter of 2017, 533 NBFIs are operating and many offer multiple services\u2014\n482 provide loan services, 22 provide factoring, 16 provide payment guarantees, 15 provide \nremittance services, 147 provide foreign exchange services, 27 provide trust services, 31 provide \ninvestment and finance consultancy services, 6 offer short-term investments, 2 issue clearing and \nsettlement instruments, and 1 is an online transaction services provider. Supervision of NBFIs is \nimpaired by a lack of staff and the absence of a risk-based approach that would provide effective, \nefficient, and targeted oversight utilizing FRC\u2019s limited resources. An assessment is also lacking \nas to the number of NBFIs operating that may need to be resolved or rehabilitated because of \nweak financial conditions.  \n \n9.  To overcome these challenges, the FRC has taken steps toward institutional reform. It has \nprioritized personnel development through capacity building programs, training, workshops, and \npostgraduate programs. This is expected to improve the overall capacity of the organization and \nmaintain personnel for longer tenures. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: a stable, sustainable, and balanced finance \nsector promoted.7 The TA will have the following outcome: nonbank finance sector contribution to \nthe financial system expanded. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Capacity of savings and credit cooperatives in business operations and \nrisk management strengthened. The capacity of SCCs to support sustainable financial inclusion \nwill be expanded. The FRC has developed and approved an SCC resolution and rehabilitation \nprogram and road map, and will support the implementation. This will include guiding the merger, \nclosure, and rehabilitation of weak SCCs while ensuring that their target populations remain \nproperly supported through financial services.  While the FRC has already identified the SCCs to \nbe included in the program, they will perform additional risk assessments and evaluations as \nneeded to confirm the necessary steps. The operationalization of a deposit insurance and a \nstabilization fund can only be successful once the sector is stabilized. While the framework for \nthis operationalization is supported under existing TA, the current output 1 will support the \ninitialization of the funds (footnote 3).  The TA will (i) guide the FRC to develop a sector road map \nthat will support the concept of financial inclusion by making financial services more accessible \nto underserved regions, (ii) direct new entrants toward areas in need of services, and (iii) help \nensure current SCCs are operationally sound. The goal is to help diversify SCC demographics \n                                                \n5  World Council of Credit Union. 2011.

The \nFRC will provide outreach training to SCCs and MOCCU to support sector capacity building in \noperational and risk management, and the development of sound business plans with expanded \nproducts to improve service to clients and achieve deepened financial inclusion. The TA will \nsupport the creation of a savings and credit cooperatives league.8  Unlike MOCCU, which \ncomprises only 63% of SCCs, the law will require a league to have 100% membership of SCCs.    \n \n12.  Output 2: Capacity of the Financial Regulatory Commission overseeing savings and \ncredit cooperatives and other nonbank financial institutions increased. The consultants will \nassess the organizational and fee structure of the FRC to provide recommendations for increased \nefficiency, given limited financial resources. The consultants along with the FRC will draft an \noptimal vision of the SCC department and recommend how best to supervise NBFIs. This will \nrequire a review of the organizational structure, training needs, and associated tasks and staff \nduties.  The  consultants  will  update  job  descriptions  and  propose  personnel  development \nprograms. The consultants will train the units responsible for SCC and NBFI oversight in the \npractical application of risk-based supervision, and consultants will accompany supervisors for \nreviews of selected SCCs and NBFIs to provide on-the-job training. The consultants will hold \ntraining  sessions  for  FRC  staff  on  prudential  standards  and  risk-based  supervision.  The \nconsultants will provide advice to assess needed governance reforms of SCCs and the potential \nfor enhancement of self-regulatory mechanisms. The consultants will make recommendations to \nreform licensing practices. The consultants along with the FRC will review the status of and \npotential for further development of digital finance technology used by NBFIs and SCCs to support \nincreasing financial inclusion. Concurrently, the consultants will assess the capacity of FRC \nsupervision over digital finance and propose activities to enhance the area\u2019s oversight capacity \nand the regulatory framework. ADB will sponsor a study tour to allow key staff from the FRC to \nattend the ICURN annual meeting and training conference and to meet with credit union and \nnonbank supervisors in the host country of the 2019 conference. As Mongolia is proposing to \napprove a new Credit Union Act to replace the current Law on Savings and Credit Cooperatives \nto improve governance of SCCs, the consultants will provide policy advice and training to ensure \nits implementation is effective. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access \nto needed data and printed documents, facilities for key meetings between the implementing \nagency  and  consultants,  printing  and  distribution  of  project material  to  staff,  assistance  in \ncoordinating meetings, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n                                                \n8  A league normally provides its members with programs and services that may include training, financial literacy, \nmanagement consulting, accounting and auditing services, standardized information technology systems, central \nfinance facilities, brokering of investments, marketing and procurement, risk management, payment and settlement \nsystems, insurance, liquidity management, and overall advocacy of SCCs. \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The executing agency is the Ministry of Finance and the implementing agency is the FRC. \nThe implementing agency will assign staff to a working group to support the project; and organize \nworkshops, conferences, and a study tour. ADB will administer the TA. ADB will select, supervise, \nand  evaluate  consultants;  and  provide  staff  to  act  as  resource  persons  in  workshop  and \nconferences if needed.  \n \n16.
