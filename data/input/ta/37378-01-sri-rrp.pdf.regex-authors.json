I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Jaffna and Kilinochchi Water Supply \nand  Sanitation  Project.1 The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nCapacity Development for Water Supply and Sanitation Service Delivery, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will \napprove the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed Project will support the government's efforts to meet the United Nations \nMillennium  Development  Goals  in  the  Jaffna  Peninsula  through  three  components:  (i) \nrehabilitating, expanding, and developing water and sanitation infrastructure; (ii) strengthening \nwater resource management; and (iii) enhancing implementation and management capacity of \nkey institutions, and providing support for project management and implementation activities.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  government  has  identified  developing  the  northern  and  eastern  provinces  and \nreducing interregional inequalities as key foundations for long-term peace. Since the end of the \narmed conflict, substantial progress has been made in addressing challenges and security \nconcerns. At the end of the war in 2009, 32 welfare centers in the north had about 327,000 \ninternally displaced persons. As of October 2010, less than 23,000 remained, and the majority \nof those are expected to return to their original residences by the end of the year, with the rest \nreturning early next year following completion of demining in their home regions. Development \npartners remain engaged with the government, and are placing increased emphasis on early \nrecovery and rehabilitating and reconstructing basic infrastructure. Security and access has \nimproved substantially, and demining is expected to be completed by the end of 2010 or early \n2011. \n \n4.  Decades of internal conflict resulted in Jaffna Peninsula lagging behind the rest of the \ncountry  economically,  as  many  facilities  for  fish  processing  and  other  key  industries  were \ndestroyed.  Investment  levels  have  remained  extremely  low,  little  maintenance  has  been \nundertaken on surviving infrastructure, and key industries, such as agriculture and fishing, have \nbeen abandoned. Poverty is the most pressing issue in Jaffna. The incidence of poverty in the \nNorthern Province is estimated to be 37%, compared with 15% for the country as a whole.3 \nPoverty in the Northern Province is multidimensional and distinct from the rest of the country. \nBoth income poverty levels and non-income poverty levels remain high, and vulnerabilities \nresulting  from  the  past  conflict  persist.  Providing  basic  needs  will  mitigate  against  these \nvulnerabilities and result in improved health and human capital. Provision of basic needs will \ncomplement government efforts to promote sustainable livelihoods, improve access to markets, \nand increase employment in the Northern Province. \n \n5.  Provision  of  water\u2014the  most  basic  of  needs\u2014and  sanitation  require  careful \nconsideration  because  of  the  distinct  characteristics  of  Jaffna.  Because  of  Jaffna's  unique \ntopography and morphology, the peninsula depends primarily on groundwater resources not \nonly for drinking water but also for many other purposes, including agriculture, the primary \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  A comprehensive study of water resources in Jaffna Peninsula and a feasibility study were conducted under \ncomponent D of the ADB-supported Conflict Affected Areas Rehabilitation Project (approved in 2003). \n3  Government of Sri Lanka. 2009. Wadakkil Wasantham: Three Year Development Strategy for the Northern \nProvince. Colombo. ", "2 \neconomic activity. The aquifer is fragile and at risk because of bacteriological contamination \nresulting from inadequate sanitation and nutrient contamination resulting from agricultural run-\noff. Over-extraction of groundwater has also led to salinity intrusion. Addressing threats to water \nresources  in  Jaffna  requires  an  integrated,  cross-sectoral,  and  multidisciplinary  institutional \nframework. Currently no regulatory mechanism for water resources exists to coordinate, plan, \nand oversee monitoring activities. \n \n6.  Key development problems affecting water and sanitation in Jaffna are related to (i) \ndamaged  sanitation  facilities  and  a  lack  of  access  to  water;4 (ii)  weak  water  resource \ncoordination and planning and a lack of essential policies for managing water resources; and \n(iii) poor institutional capacity of water and sanitation authorities and inadequate awareness on \nwater conservation, environmental protection, and hygiene among beneficiaries. \n  \n7.  The  government  recognizes  the  project  as  a  key  priority  and  a  key  part  of  the \nrehabilitation and reconstruction program for the Northern Province. The project is consistent \nwith the government's 10-year development framework,5 which (i) targets increased access to \nwater supply and sanitation, (ii) encourages the use of alternative water sources to protect and \nconserve  water  resources,  (iii)  identifies  Jaffna  as  a  national  growth  center,  (iv)  promotes \nlocalized measurement and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals \nin recognition of regional variations, and (v) works to rehabilitate and reestablish residents' \naccess to basic infrastructure in post-conflict areas. It is also consistent with (i) the country \npartnership and strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB),6 which aims to achieve socially \ninclusive development by expanding access to high-quality water supply and other services in \nlagging regions, and to assist poor households in establishing links to water supply systems; \nand (ii) the country operations business plan of ADB,7 which identifies drinking water and \nsanitation systems as areas of ADB intervention. The project was prepared in consultation with \ndevelopment partners, and will be cofinanced by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD). \n \n8.  Lessons learned from previous projects and evaluation8 in Sri Lanka have highlighted \nthe need to (i) incorporate greater consultation and participatory processes into project design \nand  implementation,  (ii)  establish  effective  regulatory  entities  and  take  other  measures  to \nprevent conflicts between water users, (iii) ensure proper project cost estimates, (iv) revise \nwater tariffs to be more sustainable, (v) introduce sewerage tariffs, and (vi) provide capacity \nbuilding to staff of agencies involved in water and sanitation. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the project will be improved health and human development in urban \nareas  of  Jaffna  Peninsula.  The  project  will  contribute  to  rehabilitating,  reconstructing,  and \ndeveloping areas affected by conflict. The outcomes of the project will be (i) improved water \nsupply and sanitation infrastructure for residents and returning internally displaced persons in \ntargeted urban areas, and (ii) improved protection and management of Jaffna Peninsula's water \nresources. The project area covers the Jaffna Peninsula and Poneryn Pradeshiya Sabha in \nKilinochchi District. The project comprises stage 1 of phase 1 of the government\u2019s three-phase \nplan to provide water for the entire Jaffna Peninsula.9 \n \n                                                 \n4  Less than 0.5% of residents in Jaffna Peninsula have access to piped water, compared with a country average of \nmore than 32%. \n5  Government of Sri Lanka. 2006.

The project will have the following components: \n \n1.  Improving Water Supply and Sanitation Infrastructure \n11.  Water  supply.  This  comprises  (i)  rehabilitating  and  improving  headworks  at  the \nIranamadu Tank10 to increase water resources and tank efficiency levels; (ii) constructing a \nwater  intake,11 a  raw-water  supply  system,  a  water  treatment  plant,  and  a  treated  water \npumping station; (iii) laying treated-water transmission mains12 to the Jaffna Municipality; and \n(iv) providing water connections to an urban council and Pradeshiya Sabhas en route to Jaffna \nMunicipality13 involving 12 off-takes.14 From the treated water transmission main, the project will \n(i) build new water distribution systems for Jaffna Municipality and the Chavakachcheri Urban \nCouncil  that  will  provide  poor  areas  with  access  to  household  connections  and  metered \ncommunity water facilities;15 (ii) build new water distribution systems for selected Pradeshiya \nSabhas of the Jaffna and Kilinochchi districts, including pipe extensions to property boundaries \nfor ease in providing household and community connections;16 (iii) install bulk/system water \nmeters; (iv) institute a leak detection program for the existing distribution network; and (v) \nprovide spare parts and maintenance equipment.17 \n \n12.  Sewerage and sanitation. This comprises (i) building a sewage collection system,18 (ii) \nbuilding  a  sewage  treatment  plant,  (iii)  building  an  effluent  sea  outfall,  and  (iv)  providing \nmaintenance equipment. The project will also provide low-cost sanitation systems for poor \ncommunities in the form of household or communal latrines.19 Given the fragility of the aquifer, \nall latrines built under this component will be connected to a septic tank, unless they are within \nthe area of Jaffna Municipality served by the sewerage system. A connection to the sewerage \nsystem will be compulsory in this area. Septic tank cleaning machines will also be provided. \n \n2.  Strengthening Jaffna Water Resource Management \n13.  This component will (i) assist the Jaffna Water Resources Management Committee in \ndesigning a policy and institutional framework for integrated water resources management by \nfinancing a study to develop a water resources management plan;20 (ii) support the National \n                                                 \n10  Includes raising and strengthening the embankment; repairing sluices, radial gates, spillway, and lift irrigation; and \nautomation.  \n11  To abstract 27,000 cubic meters per day. \n12 Treated water transmission mains are estimated to be 44 km long. \n13  These may include the following Pradeshiya Sabhas and Urban Council: Pallai (Pachcilaipallai) and Pooneryn in \nKilinochchi District; Kodikamam, Chavakachcheri, Kopay, Nallur, Valigamam South, Valigamam West, Kayts, \nVelanai, Pungudutivu Islands, and Karainagar. \n14 The government has requested AFD to fund item (ii) and part of item (iii) as well as associated consulting services \nfor design and supervision. \n15 The project will support progressive phasing out of stand posts and their conversion into metered community water \nfacilities.  Communities  supplied  with  water  through  communal  metered  facilities  will  form  community-based \norganizations (CBOs) that will register and sign agreements with the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.  \nThe CBOs will nominate representatives to coordinate and collect payments. \n16 There will be about 300,000 beneficiaries of the water system comprising an estimated two-thirds of residents in \nthe coverage area. \n17 The water supply component supports stage one of the first phase of the government\u2019s multiphased approach for \nsupplying water to the whole Jaffna Peninsula. \n18  The sewerage system will cover the most densely populated areas of Jaffna Municipality, benefiting 80,000 \npersons. \n19  These will be in areas within the project's water supply service area not covered by the project's sewerage network. \nWork in this area will be coordinated with sanitation projects of the government and other development partners. \n20 The Jaffna water resources management committee will expand on the Jaffna Water and Sanitation Sectoral \nCommittee  chaired  by  the  government  agent.  Members  will  include  the  NWSDB  (secretariat);  divisional \nsecretaries; secretaries of municipal and urban councils and Pradeshiya Sabhas; nongovernment organizations; \nand the regional director for health services. \n ", "4 \nWater  Supply  and  Drainage  Board  (NWSDB),  the  Water  Resources  Board,  and  other \ninstitutions in developing a groundwater quality and quantity monitoring system; (iii) support \nmunicipalities,  urban  councils,  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  in  monitoring  and  managing \ngroundwater resources by helping them design effective by-laws, rules, and regulations; and (iv) \nconduct  public  water  conservation,  environmental  protection,  and  hygiene  awareness \ncampaigns, and a program for community monitoring. \n \n3.  Building Capacity of the NWSDB to Carry Out Project Implementation and \nBuild Regional Office in Jaffna  \n14.  This component will (i) support the NWSDB to build a regional office in Jaffna, and (ii) \nprovide capacity and administration support for the Jaffna Regional Office (JRO) to carry out \nproject implementation. \n \nD.

Commitment \ncharges for an ADB loan are 0.15% per year to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\n \n16.  The government has requested the following loans amounting to $90 million from ADB \nfor the project: (i) a $20 million loan from ADB's ordinary capital resources, which will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; the loan will \nhave  a  25-year  term  including  a  grace  period  of  6  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.15%  per \nannum,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project \nagreements. The government has provided ADB with (a) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (b) \nan undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance \non any communication or advice from ADB; and (ii) a loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSDR44,286,000 from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources which will have a 32-year term, including \na grace period of 8 years, an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \n ", "5 \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \n17.  The government has also sought a loan from AFD in the amount equivalent to $40 \nmillion to finance part of the cost of the water supply subcomponent and associated consulting \nservices for design and supervision. Conditions and arrangements for AFD cofinancing will be \nthrough a bilateral financing agreement to be negotiated between the government and AFD \nafter approval of the loan expected in December 2010. AFD will administer its loan and the \ncoordination arrangements of this collaborative cofinancing will be detailed in a memorandum of \nunderstanding between ADB and AFD.  \n \n18.  The two ADB loans, which amount to $90 million, or 54.9% of the project investment \ncost), will be used to finance civil works, equipment, consultants, incremental administration \ncosts, and financial charges; financing from AFD of $40 million equivalent, or 24.4% of the \nproject  investment  costs,  will  be  used  to  finance  civil  works  and  equipment  required  for \nimplementing part of the water supply component; and government financing in the amount of \n$34 million, or 20.75% of the total project investment costs, will be used to finance environment \nand social mitigation costs, and taxes and duties. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount Share of \nSource  ($ million)   Total (%) \nA.

The piped water supply system with water sourced from Iranamadu is currently the only \nviable option to provide 27,000 cubic meters per day of water required to replace the Jaffna \nPeninsula's  reliance  on  increasingly  poor  quality  local  ground  water  supplies.22 The  water \ntreatment  plant  will  be  a  conventional  surface  water  treatment  plant.  The  NWSDB  has \nexperience with such plants. This will require ensuring upstream management of the catchment \nand ensuring source protection by the government. Due to land constraints, a sewage treatment \nplant with a mechanical system is proposed. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n22.  The NWSDB suffers from large financial losses because of low tariffs, increasingly high \nenergy costs, high nonrevenue water, and high accounts receivables. However, its losses are \ndeclining as a result of major tariff revisions in 2009 and declining operational costs. The \n                                                 \n22  Alternate sources were extensively considered during prefeasibility. Bore holes were constructed and modeling for \nvarious scenarios were undertaken. These show groundwater to be limited and not a current sustainable technical \noption. Continued study and modeling will be a part of the project. Sources found sustainable can be considered \nfor a future phase of water supply. Barrages and dikes, first introduced in the 1700s by the Dutch and further \ndeveloped after, act as saltwater exclusion schemes. Their ongoing rehabilitation and reconstruction is expected to \ncontribute to reduced exposure and vulnerability of the aquifer.  \n ", "7 \nfinancial internal rates of return for the water and sewerage subprojects are negative because of \nlarge capital costs. Nevertheless, the adopted subproject designs are considered the least-cost \noption. To maintain operation of the subprojects, it will be imperative to implement the indicative \nfinancial improvement action. The NWSDB will submit to ADB income statements and annual \nprojections that include operations and maintenance, debt service, and depreciation costs. If \nannual projections show negative values, the NWSDB will raise water and sewerage tariffs to \nsecure a positive net income ratio. Economic analysis shows that the economic internal rates of \nreturn for the base scenarios are 15.5% for water supply and 13.4% for sanitation. These are \nhigher than the economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 12%. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial management assessment undertaken during project preparation indicates that \nthe  NWSDB  can  manage  loan  proceeds  during  project  implementation.  However,  for  the \nNWSDB to achieve the highest accuracy in accounting, it is necessary for NWSDB to complete \nand fully implement the ongoing enterprise resource planning system23 development. Also, \nregistration of newly created assets in accounting books is generally delayed even after the \nNWSDB completes construction work. As such, depreciation on assets is not accounted for \nand/or is underestimated by the NWSDB. This may affect the tariff revision process, as the \nNWSDB\u2019s tariff policy is to recover operations and maintenance costs and the higher of debt \nservice costs or depreciation costs. \n \n24.  The  NWSDB,  a  central  institution  with  a  strong  provincial  presence,  has  been  the \nexecuting agency for ADB projects in Sri Lanka before, and is familiar with ADB operational \nguidelines.24 However, as the project deals with water resources and entails transmission of \nwater from the mainland to the Jaffna Peninsula in a post-conflict setting, the project proposes \nthat the NWSDB pay more attention to stakeholder consultation than in previous projects it has \nadministered. The project will encourage and strengthen institutions directly linked to project \nexecution to conduct consultations with not only beneficiaries but all persons who might possibly \nbe affected by the project, preferably on an ongoing basis. Special attention will be paid to \nmanaging grievances of\u2014and ensuring that benefits accrue to\u2014farmer communities living in \nand around the water source (Iranamadu Tank). Relevant institutions will be strengthened to \ndeal with amicably resolving any water-rights disputes and conflicts that may arise.  \n \n25.  The government will provide ADB with detailed quarterly progress reports on project \nimplementation, which will follow ADB\u2019s procedures. Independent auditors acceptable to ADB \nwill  audit  the  project  accounts,  including  the  imprest  accounts,  second-generation  imprest \naccounts, and statement of expenditures.  \n \n26.  Procurement will be carried out by the PMCIU and the project implementation unit. \nGoods, related services, and works to be financed from the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Civil works contracts \nvalued at $3 million equivalent and above and equipment contracts valued at $500,000 and \nabove will be undertaken through international competitive bidding procedures, while civil works \ncontracts valued at less than $3 million will be carried out under national competitive bidding. \nEquipment packages valued below $500,000 will be procured following national competitive \n                                                 \n23 Enterprise resource planning is generally an integrated computer-based system used to manage internal and \nexternal resources, such as tangible assets, financial resources, materials, and human resources. \n24 This will be the sixth ADB project executed by the NWSDB, which has also implemented large projects for other \ndevelopment partners. The NWSDB is generally experienced in procuring infrastructure schemes and contracts of \nsubstantial size required to meet international standards. Moreover, given that the agency is run by professional \nengineers, the NWSDB generally possesses sufficient technical knowledge to assess bids. \n ", "8 \nbidding procedures and packages valued at $100,000 equivalent and below will be under \nshopping procedures. The summary of major procurement packages are in Table 3. \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government, the NWSDB, and the Northern Provincial Council. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n28.  Safe water and sanitation are basic needs, and providing those needs in the project area \nwill directly reduce poverty. Increasing access to safe water and improving sanitation further \nreduce poverty by (i) improving public health and reducing malnutrition, resulting in reduced \nexpenditures on health and reduced work days lost from morbidity (which in turn leads to \nincreased labor productivity and income); and (ii) time savings from water collection, particularly \nfor women and children, resulting in more time for productive activities and improving human \ncapital.  The  project  will  (i)  provide  access  to  household  water  connections  and  metered \ncommunity water facilities in poor areas, and (ii) provide low-cost sanitation programs for poor \ncommunities in the form of individual household or communal latrines. Management of water \nand sanitation facilities for the poor will be through a participatory approach.25  \n \n29.  Participation is a crucial element of the project's pro-poor approach. The project will \nprovide  opportunities  to  form  and  empower  community-based  organizations,  and  will  help \nvulnerable groups and the very poor obtain water connections through a scheme of staggered \npayments for water connections. Nongovernment organizations will be engaged to support the \nPMCIU and local governments in mobilizing communities and delivering essential training for \ncommunity-based organizations in planning, monitoring, and evaluating sanitation and hygiene \nimprovement. Local authorities will be invited to play an active role in service delivery planning \nand administration, and community leaders will be invited to actively participate in the proposed \nproject\u2019s water conservation, environmental protection, and hygiene awareness campaign. A \nseparate grant is proposed to provide relief to communities outside the service area of the \nproposed loan. This grant will provide water and sanitation services and livelihood support to \nreturning internally displaced persons and others living in poor rural communities.26 \n \n30.  Despite women\u2019s major responsibilities in collecting, using, and managing water, they \nare  rarely  involved  in  decision  making  on  the  planning,  design,  and  construction  of  water \nfacilities. To maximize benefits for women, the project must recognize their role and needs in \nthe decision making process. Key issues to be addressed include (i) consulting with both \nwomen and men on issues surrounding water transfer, the use of water for cultivation, drinking \nwater,  and  sanitation;  (ii)  mainstreaming  gender  concerns  into  water  and  sanitation  at \norganizational and program levels; and (iii) building the capacities of both men and women to \nenable an effective mainstreaming process.27  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n31.  Environment. The project is categorized as environmental category B and an initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) with a detailed environmental management plan (EMP) was \n                                                 \n25 Strategies are further discussed in the Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2).  \n26 The proposed grant design will provide human and financial capacity support and monitoring to facilitate operation \nand maintenance of rural schemes. \n27  Detailed in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nprepared in accordance with ADB's Safeguards Policy Statement (2009).28 The IEE concludes \nthat no significant adverse environmental impacts are anticipated.29 The project's significant \nenvironmental  benefits  will  include  protection  of  the  fragile  aquifer,  improved  hygiene  and \nsanitary conditions, improved wastewater treatment and disposal, improved ecosystem health \nresulting from reduced discharge of wastewater into sensitive areas, and reduced water losses \nfrom the currently inefficient water distribution system. Mitigation measures and monitoring \nplans have been proposed in the EMP. The EMP will be implemented and monitored by the \nPMCIU. Project engineering and institutional consultants will assist the PMCIU in ensuring \nimplementation of the EMP.  \n \n32.  Social. The project is category B for involuntary resettlement.30 A resettlement plan was \nprepared for the acquisition of a 0.3-hectare privately owned land plot affecting one household. \nThe project is category C for indigenous peoples. The population in the project area is largely \nhomogenous (Tamil) and the socioeconomic survey and consultations show that no distinctive \nand separate indigenous peoples live in the project area.  \n \n33.  The NWSDB has developed internal safeguards capacity from past and ongoing ADB-\nsupported projects. However, given the sensitivity of the Jaffna Peninsula in the post-conflict \ncontext, the project will ensure that adequate numbers of staff are in place to handle both \nenvironmental and social safeguards during project implementation.31 The IEE and resettlement \nplan will be posted on ADB's website. Annual EMP and resettlement plan implementation \nprogress reports will be provided to ADB. \n   \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures  \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of capacity in service delivery  The project includes technical assistance for building capacity for water \nsupply and sanitation service delivery through training for the NWSDB \n(JRO), the Jaffna Municipal Council, urban councils, selected \nPradeshiya Sabhas, and the Water Resources Board. \nEconomic growth cannot be easily projected   Because of the 30-year conflict, unrestricted access only recently \nbecame possible.

Construction-related impacts relate to dust generation from excavation activities; and increased vibrations, \nnoise, fumes, and traffic disruption during construction activities. Good engineering design and management plans \nwill minimize these impacts as well as any impacts associated with operations. All effluent discharge will comply \nwith national standards. \n30 Rehabilitation work will be undertaken within existing facilities and new construction will be undertaken on vacant \ngovernment  land,  wherever  possible.  Where  land  acquisition  is  required,  project  design  ensures  that  no \ndisplacement will result and that the land is not a significant source of income or subsistence. \n31 This includes an environmental officer and a resettlement officer. Through the PMCIU, these officers will monitor \nand supervise the EMP, and coordinate any land acquisition and resettlement activities. \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nFunding for irrigation support not secured  Government is committed and provides assurance that the funds for \n  irrigation will be provided. \nDelays in obtaining A9 right of way   Government toensure coordination with relevant agencies in \nscheduling pipe-laying and road repairs, and will ensure that it is \npermitted to lay water lines under existing or future carriageways, if \nrequired.\nEmergence of other water users or polluters not  The project includes capacity building to coordinate water resource \nunder the influence of NWSDB  management and a public awareness campaign. \nA9 = Kandy to Jaffna Highway, JRO=Jaffna Regional Office, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board.\nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nV.
