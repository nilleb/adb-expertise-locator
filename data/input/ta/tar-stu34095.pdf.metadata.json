INTRODUCTION\n1.  A main feature of Asia\u2019s success story is the remarkable social transformation and\npoverty reduction that have accompanied the region\u2019s rapid economic growth. Some three\ndecades ago, more than half the region was poor, just two of five adults were literate, and\nthe average person could hope to live only 48 years. At present, the proportion of poor\npeople is down to one third, 70 percent of adults are literate, and life expectancy is up to 65\nyears. And while the region\u2019s population has increased from 1.8 billion to 3.0 billion, the\nnumber of poor people has dropped from more than 1 billion to about 900 million.\n2.  However, because Asia is so vast and heterogeneous, its success story is not\nequally applicable to all economies. There are large differentials in economic and social\nprogress between and within countries in the region. The contrast between the economies in\nSouth Asia and those in East and Southeast Asia is sharp. Even the more dynamic East and\nSoutheast Asia have suffered some setbacks, including increases in transient poverty in the\ncountries  hardest  hit  by  the  recent  Asian  financial  crisis.  While  these  economies  are\nrecovering more briskly than anticipated, more time and effort will be required to reverse the\nsocial costs of the crisis.\n3.  Some  countries  have,  wittingly  or  unwittingly,  adopted  more  pro-poor  economic\ngrowth strategies than others, and with remarkable success. What the key policy ingredients\nare of such growth and what factors, apart from economic growth differences, account for\nthe  differential  progress  in  social  development  and  poverty  reduction  across  Asian\ndeveloping countries, remain challenging questions.  These issues will be addressed by this\ntechnical assistance (TA) study.1  The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.   BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. The  extent  and  seriousness  of  poverty  vary  markedly  across  Asian  developing\ncountries. The table on poverty incidence illustrates these sharp differences, using either\nnational  or  dollar-a-day  definitions.  For  example,  using  national  definitions,  poverty\nincidence ranges from a low of 6 percent in the People\u2019s Republic of China to a high of 42\npercent in Nepal; or using the international definition, poverty goes from less than 2 percent\nin Thailand and Kazakhstan to a high of 50.3 percent in Nepal.2\n5.  Poverty is the outcome not only of economic processes, but also of social and\npolitical processes and how these interact with each other. Mediating these interactions is a\nvariety of institutions that are important to understanding poverty and to devising needed\npolicies. Thus, while economic growth is widely recognized to be the principal engine that\npromotes poverty reduction and improvements in people\u2019s living standards, it alone cannot\nfully explain the intercountry differences in achievements made toward poverty reduction.\n6.  Accelerating the progress of poverty reduction requires a strategy that, in addition to\npromoting  rapid  economic  growth,  will  address  other  determinants  as  well,  including\ninstitutions and policies. For instance, removing institutional and policy constraints can make\neconomic growth pro-poor. The new poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) adopts a comprehensive approach and recognizes this concern: \u201cSince poverty\ncauses and characteristics differ from country to country, the starting point must be a\n                                                          \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition)  in March 2000.\n2  The two definitions commonly used leave much to be desired.  Other definitions, such as that used in the\nUnited Nations Development Programme, Human Development Report 1999, also show similarly sharp\ndifferences in poverty rates across Asian developing countries that cannot be explained by economic growth\ndifferentials alone.", "2\ncomprehensive examination of the constraints and opportunities for poverty reduction in\neach country.\u2026 This will require understanding the nature, intensity, and spread of poverty;\nthe  distributional  effects  of  macroeconomic  policies;  the  focus  and  efficiency  of  public\nexpenditures; and the effectiveness of government programs and institutions.\u201d3\nPoverty Incidence in Selected Developing Member Countries\nPoverty Indicator (in % of population)\nDeveloping Member Countries National $1/person/day\nNepal 42.0 (1995-1996) 50.3  (1995)\nPhilippines 40.6 (1994) 26.9  (1994)\nKyrgyz Republic 40.0 (1993) 18.9  (1993)\nSri Lanka 35.3 (1990-1991) 4.0    (1990)\nIndia 35.0 (1994) 47.0  (1994)\nKazakhstan 34.6 (1996) <2.0  (1993)\nPakistan 34.0 (1991) 11.6  (1991)\nMalaysia 15.5 (1989) 4.3    (1995)\nIndonesia 15.1 (1990) 7.7    (1996)\nThailand 13.1 (1992) <2.0  (1992)\nChina, People\u2019s Rep. of 6.0   (1996) 22.2  (1995)\nSource: David, I.P., A.

Institutions are \u201cthe humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic,\nand social interactions.\u201d4 Institutions include social networks, gender roles, the legal system,\nand the state more generally\u2014all of which interact with each other. Institutions are either\nstate or nonstate. State institutions cover many aspects, such as the public provision of\nbasic education and health services, public order and safety, and infrastructure. The nature\nof governance will determine the availability and quality of these public services and, hence,\nthe extent to which the poor have access to them.\n8.  Nonstate  institutions  are  social  institutions,  values,  and  norms.  A  key  social\ninstitution is social capital, which consists of informal norms or established relationships that\nenable people to pursue objectives and act in concert for common benefit. Social capital is\nparticularly important for the poor. Ethnicity and gender roles, which remain pronounced in\nAsia and lead to discrimination against minorities and females, are other institutions that\nunderlie poverty and inequality.\n9. Thus, apart from economic growth, various institutions and policies can explain why\nsome countries have reduced poverty and inequality faster than others, or why in particular\n                                                          \n3 ADB. 1999.

Institutions  and  policies\ninfluence  all  three  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy:  pro-poor,  sustainable\neconomic  growth;  social  development;  and  governance.  Analyzing  the  nature  of  these\ninstitutions and policies will contribute to a deeper understanding of poverty and pro-poor\ngrowth, as well as to the formulation of more effective country poverty reduction strategies.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10.  This  regional  TA  will  support  a  cross-country  comparative  analysis  of  pro-poor\ngrowth and poverty reduction constraints to provide a broad analytical underpinning for\ncountry-specific poverty analyses and strategies, over the medium to long run. Specifically,\nthe TA study will (i) analyze the extent to which economic growth experiences in selected\ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) have been pro-poor, anti-poor, or neutral; (ii) identify\nand analyze institutional and policy constraints on poverty reduction; (iii) distill lessons of\nexperience and best practices; (iv) determine effective strategies to overcome obstacles to\npoverty reduction and foster pro-poor growth; and (v) recommend specific ways for ADB and\nother international organizations to assist in reducing poverty in the DMCs. Related ADB\npoverty studies (ongoing or proposed) are listed in Appendix 2.\nB. Scope\n11.  The study will include an analysis of various DMCs\u2019 economic growth experiences to\ngain a deeper understanding of what constitutes pro-poor growth, as well as of policies and\ninstitutions that impede or facilitate poverty reduction in selected DMCs. The analysis will\nthus also look into such critical issues as governance, public expenditure management, and\ndecentralization to the extent that these are related to institutional constraints on poverty\nreduction. The study will examine poverty reduction strategies that work and do not work,\nand how international agencies can be effectively involved in the task of poverty reduction.\n12.  The  study  will  analyze  the  experience  of  selected  East  and  Southeast  Asian\neconomies\u2014(tentatively)  Republic  of  Korea;  Malaysia;  Taipei,China;  and  Thailand\u2014that\nhave succeeded in pursuing pro-poor growth. For comparison, the study will also analyze\nthe experience of DMCs that have been less successful in achieving pro-poor growth and\nreducing poverty, such as (tentatively) Bangladesh, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic,\nPakistan, Philippines, and Viet Nam. Apart from differences in economic growth and poverty\nreduction, these DMCs have varied experiences in the functioning of pertinent institutions\nand  policies.  The  East  Asian  economies  (Republic  Korea  and  Taipei,China)  can  be\nreviewed  using  available  materials,  supplemented  by  interviews  with  key  persons  in\ngovernment, private sector, and civil society. The other DMCs have either completed or\nongoing country poverty assessments. The study will use these country assessments along\nwith other available sources supplemented by interviews with key individuals in different\nsectors.", "4\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $610,000.  The  cost  estimates  include\nconsulting services, fieldwork, and regional and in-country seminars and workshops. The\nentire amount will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program.\nDetails of the cost estimates are given in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14.  ADB  is  the  Executing  Agency  of  the  TA.  ADB\u2019s  Economics  and  Development\nResource  Center  (EDRC),  in  collaboration  with  the  programs  departments,  will  be\nresponsible for implementing the TA, with the support of an interdepartmental working group\n(IWG). The IWG will comprise staff of the programs departments, Strategy and Policy\nDepartment  (the  Poverty  Reduction  Unit,  in  particular),  agriculture  and  social  sectors\ndepartments, Office of Environment and Social Development, Operations Evaluation Office,\nOffice  of  the  General  Counsel,  and  EDRC  as  chair.  The  IWG  will  ensure  effective\ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  concerned  departments  and  offices.  Staff  of  the  programs\ndepartments will be involved in the country analyses. Moreover, the IWG will attempt to\ncoordinate with poverty reduction activities undertaken by other international organizations,\ne.g., United Nations agencies, United Nations Development Programme, and World Bank.\n15. The study will be carried out in two phases over 9-10 months. The first phase of the\nstudy will be the analysis of the experience of the more successful East and Southeast\nAsian economies, while the second phase will be the analysis of the other DMCs plus the\nintegration  of  the  results  of  the  two  phases.  An  interdisciplinary  team  of  international\nconsultants (12 person-months) with expertise in economic growth and poverty, institutional\neconomics, and social values and norms will help carry out the study. The outline terms of\nreference for the consultants are given in Appendix 4. The consultants will be selected and\nengaged as individuals by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n16.  The TA will commence in September 2000 and will be completed by July 2001. An\ninception workshop will be conducted in October 2000, and a finalization conference will be\nheld in July 2001 in Manila to discuss the findings and recommendations of the TA.\nIV.
