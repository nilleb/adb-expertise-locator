INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) responds to Asian Development \nBank (ADB) developing member country (DMC) requests to stimulate inclusive and sustainable \ngrowth and service delivery by strengthening public sector capacity. The TA supports ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 6 on strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity.1 The TA will build on two previous TA projects: Enhancing Governance and Capacity \nDevelopment as a Driver of Change,2 and the Governance and Capacity Development Initiative \n(Phase 2).3 The TA team will add value to ongoing and forthcoming programs and projects by \nsupporting  DMCs  through  ADB  operations  departments  in  (i)  preparing  governance  risk \nassessments (GRAs) at the country level and sector level to inform country partnership strategies \n(CPS) and enable ADB\u2019s shift toward country systems;4 and (ii) providing knowledge-sharing \nsolutions and institutional capacity activities in selected DMCs to overcome complex governance \nchallenges and promote innovation and learning.  \n \n2.  The TA will contribute to improved alignment between ADB public sector management \n(PSM) operations and ADB strategy and policies on PSM, targeting institutional performance and \ncapacity development. It will lead to better-integrated upstream PSM operations and downstream \nsector support to add value to ADB programs and projects.5 The TA will address, in part, \nweakening performance in project quality that a forthcoming ADB evaluation report highlights.6 \nThe TA is included in the 2020 Management-approved results-based work plan of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Strategy 2030 recognizes that managing the challenges and opportunities brought about \nby a changing global and regional landscape requires strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity  in  DMCs.  ADB  country  performance  assessments  indicate  that  public  sector \nperformance in Asia and the Pacific has improved overall, but significant challenges remain.8 \nIndividual countries present varied pictures of institutional performance, and this diversity is made \nevident  by  the  differing  outcomes  of  standardized  parameters  measuring  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity. However, establishing adequate \u201clearning channels\u201d presents a challenge \nbecause of the tacit nature and granularity of much of the relevant information and experience. In \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila; and ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n4 Country  systems  typically  include  national  arrangements  and  procedures  for  public  financial  management, \nprocurement, results, monitoring and evaluation, and social and environmental procedures. Use of country systems \nrefers to the use of a country\u2019s national, subnational, or sectoral implementing institutions and applicable laws, \nregulations, rules, and procedures for the activity or operations being supported by ADB. \n5  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 April 2020. \n8  A country performance assessment is conducted for DMCs with access to the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and \nlinks the allocation of ADF resources to country policy and institutional performance. Performance is shown to vary \namong countries, but such DMCs tend to perform best in budgetary and financial management and revenue \nmobilization. Many DMCs still struggle with public administration capacity; property rights and contract rights \nenforcement; and transparency, accountability, and corruption in the public sector.  \n ", "2 \nthis regard, ADB is well-positioned to draw on its regional experience in global networks, its \nconvening power, its experience in interdisciplinary approaches to PSM, and its ability to combine \ntechnical knowledge with development finance to catalyze institutional change and reform in \nDMCs. \n \n4.  Governance outcomes and sustainable development outcomes are intrinsically linked. A \ncountry\u2019s governance and institutional capacity affect the way governments perform and their \nability to achieve all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including those on climate change, \ngender, and infrastructure. By prioritizing governance and institutional capacity in DMCs, ADB is \naligning  its  aspirations  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific  with  the  SDGs.9 SDG  16  on  governance \nrecognizes that the worldwide governance agenda remains unfinished and calls on countries to \nbuild effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels; promote the rule of law; \nenhance government transparency; and reduce corruption.  \n \n5.  ADB  experience.  ADB  has  several  mutually  reinforcing  approaches  to  supporting \ngovernance and boosting institutional capacity in DMCs. These include (i) supporting public \nmanagement reforms and financial stability through PSM operations; (ii) focusing on governance \nand institutional actions that promote effective, timely, and corruption-free service delivery; and \n(iii)  strengthening  country  systems  and  standards.  Rather  than  viewing  these  as  separate \noperational  areas,  ADB  is  coordinating  actions  across  all  three  to  enable  more  integrated \nsolutions to DMCs and greater alignment of public and private sector operations. \n \n6.  ADB has developed separate operational procedures to recognize the complementarity of \ngovernance and capacity development. For instance, ADB\u2019s operational plan for governance, the \nSecond Governance and Anticorruption Plan (GACAP II), is fundamentally a diagnostic tool that \naims to strengthen government institutions in DMCs by focusing on three core areas: public \nfinancial management (PFM), procurement, and combating corruption. These areas affect ADB \noperational performance and quality as well as DMC development effectiveness. The review of \nGACAP II in 2013\u2014and a learning note commissioned by the Governance Thematic Group of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDTC-GOV) in 2019 to anchor \nfuture directions on delivering Strategy 2030 and achieving GACAP II outcomes\u2014remain relevant \nand are integral to the delivery of the operational priorities. Yet results have been mixed and there \nis evidence of weak commitment to and ownership of GACAP II across country teams. The review \nalso highlights that while risk assessments, having elevated governance issues through PFM, \nprocurement, and anticorruption areas in countries, sectors, and projects, need to be further \nstrengthened and the monitoring of risk management plans need to be more consistent.10 \n \n7.  Lastly, approaches to addressing institutional strengthening and capacity issues continue \nto evolve. There is increasing importance assigned to the country-specific context in which \ninstitutions operate and the ability of stakeholders to adapt to change as the outcomes of capacity \ndevelopment processes. Development partners are increasingly looking beyond training and \ntechnical  advisory  services  to  DMCs  as  drivers  of  change  and  transformation,  alongside \nstrengthening  the  use  of  country  systems  to  enhance  institutional  performance.  The  2007 \nMedium-Term Framework and Action Plan for capacity development governs ADB\u2019s approach to \ncapacity development.11 ADB reviewed the framework in 2016 and committed to strengthening \n \n9  United Nations General Assembly. 2015.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nits implementation in operations, broadening the base of recommended good practices, and \nstrengthening the quality-at-entry review process for the selection of capacity development \nsupport. This is particularly important across all DMCs, but especially across DMCs with access \nto the Asian Development Fund (ADF), where returns are potentially much higher given the \nweaker institutional base of such DMCs. \n \n8.  ADB often delivers governance and institutional support to DMCs as a component of a \nsector program or project, and not as a stand-alone activity. A forthcoming ADB evaluation report \n(footnote 6) highlights that while the success rate of PSM operations remains high (91% on \naverage during 2017\u20132019, down 1 percentage point from 2016\u20132018), the success rate of \nsovereign operations fell to 71% from 77% on average across the same 3-year time periods. \nSimilarly, projects with governance and/or capacity development as a theme declined to from 74% \nto 68% of all projects during that time. This TA will play an important role in mainstreaming \ngovernance by supporting GRAs, which will be of increasing relevance under the context of the \ncoronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic  and  post-pandemic  operations,  where  such \nassessments will be even more carefully reviewed. \n \n9.  ADB  value  addition.  SDTC-GOV  has  supported  ADB\u2019s  governance  and  capacity \ndevelopment strategies in operations since 2009 through two TA projects (para. 1). These TA \nprojects have assisted in elevating governance and capacity development as a corporate priority \nat ADB. While mainstreaming GRAs has become widespread, it is important to build institutional \ncapacity to shape specific organizational development processes. However, building institutional \ncapacity has yet to become a standard feature of ADB operations. The overall success of these \nTA projects hinged on the flexibility to respond to operational demands and connect TA activities \nto CPS, sector assessments, sector road maps, and longer-term operations to address DMC \ngovernance and capacity issues. ADB has been successful in combining sound diagnostics and \nclose collaboration with DMC stakeholders with adept use of operational modalities. This TA will \nbuild on these gains and upscale emerging good practices, learning from and sharing innovative \npractices in DMCs and globally. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: public service delivery in selected DMCs \nimproved.12 The TA will have the following outcome: governance and institutional capacity in \nselected DMCs improved.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Governance  risk  and  sector  assessments  for  selected  developing \nmember countries completed. A focus on the quality of governance and institutional analysis in \ncountry and sector assessments can improve quality-at-entry and promote sector-wide and cross-\nsector attention to governance and capacity issues in country and sector results frameworks. \nUnder this output, the TA team will support operations departments to assist selected DMCs in \n \n12 ADB. 2018.

This output will support at least seven GRAs, informing selected CPS \nthat are expected to be prepared during the TA\u2019s implementation period.16 The TA team will \nprioritize resident missions that lack sufficient in-house governance expertise to support DMCs in \nthis  area.  Emphasis  will  be  placed  on  supporting  dialogue  with  DMCs  and  improving  risk \nmanagement assessment plans. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Knowledge  of  governance  and  institutional  capacity  for  developing \nmember countries increased. Under this output, the TA team will (i) publish a set of knowledge \nproducts guided by DMC needs, including policy and technical guidance notes on operational \npriorities;17 and (ii) conduct small-scale knowledge-sharing and capacity development activities18 \nfocusing on mitigating governance risks and overcoming complex governance challenges in \nselected DMCs.19 The TA team will target priority sectors, recognizing that public sector agencies \nin the region need deeper vertical specialization, as well as better horizontal integration across \nsector and disciplinary boundaries, and across geographical and political borders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($250,000 from TASF 6 and $250,000 from TASF-other \nsources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. SDTC-GOV will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \norganize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops.  \n \n15.
