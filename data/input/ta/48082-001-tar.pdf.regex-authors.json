INTRODUCTION \n1.  The policy and advisory technical assistance (TA)1 has been developed at the request of \nthe Ministry of Roads and Transportation (MRT) of the Government of Mongolia. Through this \nTA, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will support the MRT in preparing a national intelligent \ntransport system (ITS)2 policy and a strategic deployment plan. In September 2015, ADB and \nthe MRT reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncost, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Mongolia  faces  many  challenges  in  making  the  country\u2019s  economic  and  social \ndevelopment process more efficient, inclusive, and integrated. While all sectors are affected, the \ncountry\u2019s large size, low density in rural areas, and densely populated capital city (Ulaanbaatar) \nmake the development challenges more acute in the transport sector. These include (i) reducing \ntransport and logistics costs for trade to foster regional integration; (ii) enhancing transport \nefficiency  and  safety;  (iii)  promoting  urban  efficiency  through  improved  urban  transport \nmanagement and services; (iv) developing cost-effective solutions to enhance rural accessibility; \nand (v) improving institutional and financial management, and human capacity to ensure asset \nsustainability. \n \n3.  An ITS is an information and communication technology (ICT) area where opportunities \nfor improving the performance of urban and rural transport have not yet been properly explored \nin Mongolia. Because of the country\u2019s vast size, sparse settlement patterns in rural areas, and \nrapid rural\u2013urban migration to Ulaanbaatar, transport infrastructure investments need to be \ncarefully chosen to ensure they are economically viable and maximize the efficiency and safety \nof existing transport infrastructure. When planned and deployed in an integrated way, an ITS \nalso  offers  a  great  opportunity  for  using  existing  transport  infrastructure  more  efficiently, \nmitigating  the  limitations  of  the  constrained  transport  infrastructure,  and  optimizing  future \ninfrastructure investment. \n \n4.  ITSs  are  advanced  applications  that  aim  to  provide  innovative  services  relating  to \ndifferent modes of transport and traffic management and enable various users to be better \ninformed and make safer, more coordinated, and smarter use of transport networks. Recent \nadvances  in  telecommunications,  internet  services,  and  sensing  technologies  offer  the \npossibility of innovations, which include connected vehicles, traffic data collection, and traffic \ninformation provision through smartphones. An ITS offers considerable potential for enabling the \nefficient use of transport infrastructure, both to complement capital investments and as an \nalternative to additional capital-intensive infrastructure deployment, and as a tool for enhancing \nroad safety and transport operations capacity. \n  \n5.  Ulaanbaatar city deployed an urban ITS in 2010 with a traffic signal control system and \ntraffic control center, vehicle detectors, closed-circuit television, and variable message signs. \nHowever, the system has not been properly upgraded to match the growing travel demand and \nthe operational efficiency is very low as a result of improper maintenance and coordination with \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2015. Manila. \n2  An ITS uses information and communication technology to provide services supporting users, operators, and \nmaintainers of multiple modes of transportation\u2014resulting in safer, more efficient, and higher utility transport \nnetworks. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 February 2016. \n ", "2 \nthe traffic police. Regional roads in Mongolia are not covered by an ITS, except to monitor the \nlocation of regional buses in operation. Toll gates and the weighing system are being operated \noffline, regional roads have no emergency communication system, and the logistics sector is still \noperating without an ITS. The city deployed an e-ticketing system, bus management system, \nand bus information system in 2015 through a public\u2013private partnership, but the system is not \nyet complete and integration between the traffic control center and the bus management center \nhas not been achieved. \n \n6.  Need  for  an  integrated  intelligent  transport  system  policy.  National  and  local \ngovernments implement ITS on a project-by-project basis, rather than by following a coherent \noverarching ITS policy (with a national ITS architecture, ITS strategic plan, and open standards \ninteroperability  plan  that  would  promote  institutional  and  systems  integration).  The  ITS  in \nMongolia lags in terms of technology; it is fragmented as it does not have a national ITS policy, \nITS architecture and standards plan, and strategic investment plan (including a technology and \nproject road map and implementation plan); and it is inefficient as it lacks associated institutional \ncooperation. \n   \n7.  Information  and  communication  technology  and  intelligent  transport  system \ndevelopment  in  Mongolia.  The  government\u2019s  ICT  initiatives  focus  on  overcoming  the \ndevelopment constraints of high logistics costs. It has launched various initiatives to use ICT to \nsupport the creation of a knowledge society and has made significant progress through the             \nE-Mongolia National Program, the E-Government Master Plan, the Smart Government Project, \nand the Budget Transparency Law, 2014.4 These programs are designed to deliver services in \nan  efficient  and  transparent  manner,  and  support  business  process  reforms  across  the \ngovernment. They have created high demand for improved ICT infrastructure and e-solutions. \nDeveloping ICT in the transport sector can leverage these efforts and increase the sector\u2019s \noverall efficiency and effectiveness. \n \n8.  A well-integrated ITS is vital for the Mongolian transport environment, where the road \nnetwork is sparsely located in rural areas and road capacity is very limited in the urban area. \nMongolia\u2019s transport sector can be safer, more efficient, and more sustainable by applying ICT \nto all modes of passenger and freight transport\u2014adding ITS applications and equipment to the \nexisting telecommunication infrastructure. The integration of existing transport services can also \ncreate new services, jobs, and growth in the transport and ICT sectors. To be effective, the \nnear-, medium-, and long-term rollout of ITS needs to be coherent and coordinated across the \ncountry\u2019s transport and allied entities. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA will be enhanced transport operation and management in Mongolia. \nThe TA is aligned with the ICT National Strategy 2013.5 The outcome of the TA will be the \npresentation of a national ITS policy and deployment plan to the Government of Mongolia. The \nTA will provide an opportunity for the government to integrate ITS deployment activities across \n                                                \n4  Government of Mongolia, Information and Communications Technology Authority. 2005.

The TA will adopt an ITS user service6 approach to identify priority ITS services based \non different users\u2019 needs and priorities. Potential ITS users include road users, transport system \noperators and maintainers, and government agencies in the transport sector. Identified user \nservices and service bundles (needs) will determine the ITS services (ITS architecture and \nstandards) needed to satisfy the user needs, and how those services will be customized (into \ncustomized service packages) based on actual institutional and environmental requirements. \nThe ITS architecture will specify the customized ITS service packages, which will then identify \n(i) stakeholder elements and their inputs from other stakeholder elements, and (ii) outputs to \nother stakeholder elements that implement one or more ITS user services. Each stakeholder \nelement  includes  a  set  of  functional  requirements  that  specifies  its  operations.  The  ITS \narchitecture also specifies the roles and responsibilities of each ITS stakeholder based on its \nITS elements and the ITS services in which its ITS elements participate. The deployment plan \nincludes  high-level  technology  choices  to  implement  the  near-term  customized  service \npackages (based on trade-off studies where appropriate); and considers stakeholder scope and \nperformance requirements, the sequence of projects, and near-term project investment cost \nestimates.  \n \n11.  The TA will have three outputs, as described below. \n \n(i)  Output  1:  National  Intelligent  Transport  System  Policy  and  Deployment \nPlan  for  Mongolia.  The  TA  will  prepare  the  national  ITS  policy  (needs, \narchitecture,  and  standards)  and  a  strategic  deployment  plan  (para.  10)  for \nMongolia. The policy and deployment plan will incorporates state-of-the-art ITS \nconcepts and infrastructure over 2017\u20132037, with technology choices over 2017\u2013\n2022. The output will select the ITS user services and user service bundles \nneeded to improve the efficiency and safety of the transport sector from 2017 to \n2027 for the ITS deployment plan (project road map). Existing ITS infrastructure \nand services will be incorporated in the policy and the deployment plan. This \noutput  also  includes  the  project  summary  information  describing  associated \ncustomized  service  packages  for  the  project,  project  stakeholder  element \nfunctional requirements, open standards used in the project, project assumptions \nabout scope and performance, and project cost estimates. \n(ii)  Output  2:  Intelligent  transport  system  capacity  development.  Capacity \ndevelopment will be provided to ITS-related government agency staff to support \ntheir participation in the development of output 1. The capacity development \nactivities  will  include  training,  workshops,  and  a  study  tour  of  successful \ninvestments in countries with an advanced ITS. \n(iii)  Output  3:  Knowledge  product.  A  case  study\u2014ITS  Policy  and  Deployment \nStrategy  in  Sparsely  Populated  Countries:  The  Case  of  Mongolia\u2014will  be \npublished and disseminated. \n                                                \n6  A user service is a specific need (of travelers, system operators, or system maintainers) that can be solved by one \nor more alternative ITS services. A logical grouping of user services is called a service bundle, which provides a \nconvenient way to address the range of user needs. Eight service bundles are commonly used in an ITS: travel \nand traffic management, public transportation management, electronic payment, commercial vehicle operations, \nemergency management, advanced vehicle safety systems, information management, and maintenance and \nconstruction operations. \n ", "4 \n12.  A possible risk is the lack of coordination between the different government ministries \nand  agencies  during  TA  implementation.  This  can  be  mitigated  by  (i)  forming  a  steering \ncommittee  composed  of  representatives  from  different  ministries,  agencies,  and \ntelecommunications service providers involved in ITSs; (ii) ensuring continuous policy dialogue \nwith  the  executing  agency;  and  (iii)  selecting highly  qualified  international  consultants  with \nexperience in developing national ITS policies and deployment plans. The steering committee \nwill validate the project at key draft milestones. The consulting team will analyze and track the \nsteering committee\u2019s feedback at each draft milestone to produce a final milestone that meets \nall steering committee member ministry and/or agency needs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by \nADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, access to \nadministrative data, assistance to field trips, use of office space and facilities, logistic support, \nand other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The MRT will be the executing agency and the ministry\u2019s Strategic Policy and Planning \nDepartment  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  to \nconsolidate the needs from different sectors, including (i) the Information Technology, Post and \nTelecommunications Authority, which is in charge of Mongolia\u2019s ICT sector under the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office; (ii) the Ulaanbaatar Urban Transport Control Center; and (iii) the National \nTraffic Control Center. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from 15 August 2016 to 14 July 2017, and \nwill require 14 person-months for four international consultants and 26 person-months for five \nnational consultants. The team of international and national specialists will include (i) a transport \nand/or  ITS  specialist,  (ii)  an  ITS  infrastructure  specialist,  (iii)  an  ITS  technology  and/or \nequipment specialist, and (iv) an ITS architecture and standards specialist. ADB will engage \ninternational and national firms or individuals through a firm in accordance with its Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement under the TA will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time \nto time). All disbursements under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The consulting \nteam will administer training sessions and seminars. An international firm and a national firm will \nbe hired using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 quality\u2013cost ratio. To \nimprove economy, efficiency, and value for money, all consulting services under the TA will be \nengaged on output-based (lump-sum) contracts. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund for the Intelligent Transport Systems Development for Mongolia project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nTransport operation and management in Mongolia through ITS (ICT National Strategy 2013)a enhanced \n  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nNational ITS policy and  By 2018  MRT annual report  Implementation of the \ndeployment plan  deployment plan may be \nNational ITS policy and \npresented to the  delayed by the \ndeployment plan is adopted as \nGovernment of  government\u2019s financial \na national government policy \nMongolia adopted  constraint \n(2016 baseline: Not applicable) \nOutputs       \n1.
