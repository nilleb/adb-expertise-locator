An example is in Appendix 14. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  support  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity \ndevelopment for the Water Resources Department (WRD) of the \nGovernment of Chhattisgarh (GOCG). The Project will modernize \nskills  and  upgrade  existing  development  and  management \ncapabilities. It will support capacity development and institutional \nstrengthening of water users associations (WUAs) that will assume \nresponsibility  for  irrigation  system  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M). \n \nThe Project will undertake rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of \n200\u2013300  minor  and  medium  irrigation  schemes  throughout \nChhattisgarh to improve irrigation effectiveness on about 200,000 \nhectares. R&U will be implemented through a participatory process \nthat actively involves WUAs and will help them develop a sense of \nsystem ownership to facilitate their assumption of management and \nO&M responsibility. A subcomponent of the R&U works will repair \nbroken tank sluice gates, so that the tanks will be able to store \nwater for irrigation.  \n \nIn systems that have received R&U works, the Project will assist \nWUAs develop field channels, prepare on-farm water management \nplans,  and  develop  rabi  cropping  (dry  season  and  usually  from \nDecember to March) and marketing plans. Throughout the life of the \nProject, support will be provided to WUAs to develop their skills and \nexperience needed for sustainable system O&M and rabi cropping. \n   \nRationale  Chhattisgarh  has  abundant  agricultural  land  and  rainfall,  but \nirrigated agricultural productivity is low. Only wet season rice is \ngrown in most areas although rabi cropping provides a high-value \nopportunity to improve the livelihood of many farmers with irrigation. \nIrrigation  system  performance  is  low,  however,  mainly  due  to \ninadequate O&M. The need to improve water management and \ndeficient farm practices also make it difficult for many farmers to \nengage  in  anything  but  low-value  rice  cultivation.  WUAs  were \nformed in 1999 when Chhattisgarh was part of Madhya Pradesh \n(MP) under the MP Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) Act. ", "iv   \n  WUAs have the opportunity to play an important role in improving \nthe management and O&M of irrigation as well as provide an entry \npoint for delivery of agricultural support services, but they need \ngreater  empowerment  and  capacity  development.  Improving  the \nquality  of  existing  irrigation  infrastructure,  developing  WUAs  for \neffective system management and sustainable O&M, and support \nfor  diversified  cropping  present  tremendous  opportunities  to \nimprove  agricultural  productivity  and  uplift  the  rural  sector  in \nChhattisgarh. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program \nfor India, which was finalized in April 2003, states that \u201cexpansion of \nagriculture and rural development is arguably the most important \nfeature of the new strategy to mainstream poverty reduction.\u201d ADB\u2019s \nbroadened assistance to the rural sector complements India\u2019s 10th \nFive-Year Plan and policies of the Indian Government that focus on \npromoting  equitable  growth  through  sustainable  agricultural  and \nrural  development.  Chhattisgarh\u2019s  State  Development  Plan  is  to \nimprove  the  livelihood  of  its  rural  population  through  improved \nagricultural productivity. These objectives are mutually reinforcing \nand provide a framework for investment in irrigated agriculture in \nChhattisgarh. \n   \nObjectives  The  Project  aims  to  improve  rural  livelihoods  and  reduce  rural \npoverty.  The  Project  will  improve  irrigation  service  delivery, \nenhance  agricultural  practices,  and  strengthen  water  resources \nmanagement to increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture in \nChhattisgarh. The Project has the following interrelated strategic \npriorities: (i) improve the ability of WRD to develop and manage \nirrigation  systems;  (ii)  develop  the  capacity  of  WUAs  to  play  a \nmeaningful  role  in  the  rehabilitation,  management,  and  O&M  of \nirrigation systems; (iii) rehabilitate and upgrade minor and medium \nirrigation  systems  through  a  participatory  process  directed  by \nWUAs; and (iv) enhance the WUAs' and farmers' capacities for \nimproved agricultural practices with emphasis on diversified and \nrabi cropping. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $66.6  million  equivalent.  The \nforeign  exchange  cost  is  estimated  at  $15.9  million.  The  local \ncurrency cost (including taxes and duties) is estimated at $50.7 \nmillion equivalent.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\nSource  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development Bank  8.2  37.9  46.1 \nProject Beneficiariesa  0.0  0.6  0.6 \nGovernmentb  7.7  12.2  19.9 \n       \nTotal  15.9  50.7  66.6 \na Contribution of farmers for the construction of field distribution canals. \nb  Including taxes and duties, interest during construction, and commitment fees. \nGovernment  of  India  contribution  will  support  for  the  foreign  exchange \ncomponent and Government of Chhattisgarh will support local currency costs. ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $46.1 million from the ordinary capital resources of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The \nloan will have a 25-year term including a grace period of 7 years, an \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project \nagreements. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The loan duration is 7 years. \n   \nEstimated Project  30 September 2012 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Water Resources Department of the Government of Chhattisgarh \n   \nImplementation  WRD has the mandate for planning, implementing, and operating \nArrangements  irrigation  schemes  in  Chhattisgarh  and  will  be  the  Executing \nAgency. WRD has demonstrated the capacity for implementing the \nsubproject physical works and has made a commitment to introduce \nthe necessary institutional reforms and added capacity to achieve \nfull  benefits  from  the  Project.  The  new  arrangements  involve \nestablishment of units for design, PIM, social development, and \ndam safety under the Project. The Department of Agriculture will \ndeputize staff to support agricultural activities in close collaboration \nwith the PIM unit. A project management unit will be established \nwithin  WRD  at  Raipur  to  assume  overall  responsibility  for \nmanagement  and  coordination  of  all  project  activities  including \nrecruitment of consultants. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement financed from the ADB loan proceeds will be carried \nout  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  Civil \nworks costing over $3 million will be procured through international \ncompetitive bidding procedures, and those estimated to cost $3 \nmillion or less will be procured through local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Civil works awarded under local \ncompetitive  bidding  will  be  procured  from  prequalified  bidders \nbased  on  WRD\u2019s  existing  system  of  advance  prequalification \nacceptable to ADB, and award of contracts will be consistent with \nprocurement procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  The Project will require 382 person-months of consulting services: \n92  international  and  290  domestic  (an  additional  consulting \npackage will be financed through a grant from the Government of \nthe United Kingdom). The input reflects the combination of support \nto  implement  the  physical  works  as  well  as  the  institutional \nstrengthening  necessary  to  make  the  investments  effective  and \nsustainable. Assistance is required to introduce new concepts of \nPIM, social development, and modern design procedures through \nboth  formal  and  on-the-job  training  for  the  WRD  staff  that  will \nsupport  the  new  WRD  units.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited \nthrough international firms and as individuals in accordance with \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. \n ", "vi   \nProject Benefits and  The primary economic benefits of the Project will stem from the \nBeneficiaries  R&U works on irrigation infrastructure that are expected to restore \nthe irrigation areas that farmers can effectively use to at least 90% \nof their design potential. The project R&U activities combined with \nstrengthened  WUAs  and  agricultural  support  services  will \nsignificantly  increase  rabi  cropping.  The  increased  production, \nespecially  the  rabi  cropping,  will  generate  substantial  on-farm \nemployment  for  landless  laborers,  many  of  whom  are  currently \nforced  into  seasonal  migration  due  to  underemployment.  Over \n120,000  farm  families  should  directly  benefit  from  various  R&U \nactivities. A strengthened PIM framework and capacity development \nfor  WUAs  will  improve  the  productivity  of  irrigated  agriculture \nthroughout  the  state.  The  enhanced  capacity  of  WRD  through \nproject  activities,  will  not  only  improve  implementation  of \nsubprojects  but  also  increase  the  effectiveness  of  irrigation \ninvestment throughout Chhattisgarh. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Improving  the  capacity  and  effectiveness  of  WUAs  is  critical  to \nensure sustainable O&M, improved system operation, and water \nmanagement for rabi cropping; and creation of an effective entry \npoint for delivery of agricultural support services. Sustainable WUAs \nmay not now exist, but WUA capacity development and project \nsupport  during  the  years  following  R&U  will  help  ease  the \ntransitional  period  while  WUAs  coalesce  into  effective \norganizations. Institutional changes associated with the Project will \nprovide a strong policy framework to support WUAs. The increased \nagriculture  benefits  from  improved  irrigation  provide  a  natural \nincentive  for  farmers  to  participate  and  contribute  to  the \nsustainability of the WUA. \n \nThe Project integrates institutional reform as an important strategy \nto attain objectives and ensure sustainability. A risk exists in that \nthe implementation of the reform agenda may be delayed. GOCG \nsensitization and policy dialogue regarding a strengthened PIM and \nWUA framework have been ongoing throughout project preparation. \nA national workshop on PIM in Raipur, WRD seminars, a study tour \nfor GOCG officials to other Indian states with PIM reforms, and \nconsultant support to help draft a revised PIM Act have all been part \nof project preparation. The Project will continue the policy dialogue \nand will take measures to assure successful implementation of the \npolicy  reforms.  The  Project  devotes  substantial  capacity \ndevelopment for the new functions and activities for WRD. The \nProject provides ample support to mobilize and develop effective \nWUAs throughout Chhattisgarh. Successful implementation of the \nWUA  program  and  improvement  in  irrigation  performance  will \nsolidify beneficiary and GOCG support for the reforms. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The Government of the United Kingdom will provide a technical \nassistance  (TA)  grant  in  the  amount  of  $1.9  million  to  support \ncapacity development activities for WUAs as well as for monitoring \nand  evaluation.  The  TA  will  support  development  of  the  WUA \ntraining program. ", "  vii\n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nto India for the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project, and (ii) proposed administration of \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Water  User  Association  Empowerment  for  Improved  Irrigation \nManagement in Chhattisgarh. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Despite abundant land and water resources, rural poverty in Chhattisgarh is widespread \nand tied to the productivity of the agriculture sector. Chhattisgarh has been identified as one of \nIndia\u2019s food-insecure states. The disparity in land distribution is significant, and land distribution \nand the availability of irrigation are important determinants of household livelihoods. The causes \nof the low productivity of irrigated agriculture in particular are multiple and interrelated. Increased \ndouble cropping in irrigated areas will enhance productivity dramatically, but it requires significant \nimprovements  in  irrigation  performance,  water  management,  and  agricultural  practices.  An \nintegrated approach is needed to increase productivity and maximize the impacts of irrigated \nagriculture on  rural  growth  and  poverty.  Such  an  approach  requires  not  only  investment  in \nirrigation  infrastructure,  but  a  strategy  that  includes  institutional  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment to support systemic and sustainable change. The Government of Chhattisgarh \n(GOCG)  recognizes  the  importance  and  challenge  of  animating  irrigated  agriculture  and  is \ncommitted to institutional reforms to support this integrated approach (Appendix 1). \n  \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  Agriculture in Chhattisgarh is dominated by rice, which accounts for about 75% of the \nannual cropping, or about 4.0 million out of 4.8 million hectares (ha) of the net sown area. Only \n23% of the rice produced in the state is grown under irrigation.1 Irrigated agriculture covers about \n1.3 million ha,2 of which about 43% is served by major systems (greater than 10,000 ha), 20% by \nmedium systems (2,000\u201310,000 ha), and 37% by minor systems (less than 2,000 ha). The annual \ncropping intensity on irrigated lands is only 120%, with an average irrigated paddy yield of about \n2.5 tons per ha (t/ha) compared with states like Punjab with over 180% cropping intensity, and \naverage rice yields for India as a whole of close to 4.0 t/ha. \n4.  Investment in irrigation is GOCG\u2019s chief strategy to improve food security, reduce poverty, \nand spur rural development (Appendix 2). GOCG has allocated over $100 million per year, or \n20% of its development plan budget, to irrigation development under the current 5-year plan. \nMaximizing the development impact of this investment is absolutely critical to the well-being of the \nrural sector and addressing rural poverty. In spite of this investment, however, paddy production \nrises and falls dramatically with rainfall received and has ranged from 2.9 to 5.9 million tons in \nrecent years, about 4% of India's annual rice yield. Farmers also grow about 0.5 million ha of \npulses, over 0.2 million ha of oilseed crops, as well as maize, millet, vegetables, and other crops \nprincipally in the kharif season (wet season cropping usually from June to October).3 The average \nyield of these crops as well as that of rice is considerably lower than India's national average. \nIrrigated agriculture in Chhattisgarh can be characterized as low-input production of low-valued \ngrain on marginally irrigated land where a main determinant of production is rainfall. \n5.  Underperformance in irrigated agriculture relates to the high concentration of poverty in \nrural areas where 80% of Chhattisgarh's residents live and are employed in agricultural activities. \nAn estimated 43% of the state\u2019s population lives below the poverty line, and a similar portion of \n                                                 \n1  Agricultural and irrigation statistical information in Chhattisgarh is sparse, not collected systematically, and uncertain.  \n2  About 800,000 ha are in schemes that have been completed and 500,000 ha in systems with ongoing development. \n3  Ninety percent of Chhattisgarh\u2019s annual rainfall occurs in the monsoon period from mid-June through September. ", "2 \nthe rural population lacks access to electricity, clean water, and sanitation.4 Forty-five percent of \nthe population is from scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, with an estimated 57% living below \nthe poverty line. Household survey data during project preparation revealed that the average per \ncapita income was $274 and highly skewed, with 60% of the farm households earning less than \n$150 a year. Nearly three quarters of the farmers in Chhattisgarh have holdings of less than 2 ha. \nMany of the poorest rural residents are farm laborers, and up to 40% of some communities are \nforced to migrate after the kharif rice crop due to underemployment.  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n6.  Sustainability of Irrigated Agriculture. Notwithstanding past investments, the viability \nand sustainability of irrigated agriculture are major concerns of the GOCG. The development and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation claim a major share of public resources invested \nin agriculture, but the sector continues to have inadequate and decaying infrastructure. Existing \nirrigation systems in Chhattisgarh perform much below their potential for utilization, i.e., the area \nthat farmers are effectively able to use is less than 50% of the designed area for minor schemes, \n50 to 60% for medium schemes, and about 75% for major schemes. Almost two thirds of the \nminor schemes have less than 50% utilization and one third of the minor schemes have less than \n30% utilization. While evidence of inappropriate planning and design exists, the unsatisfactory \nstatus of irrigation facilities is mainly due to degradation from inadequate O&M. \n7.  The  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  of  GOCG  has  over  3,500  staff  members \nincluding several hundred trained engineers, but their skills would benefit from upgrading to allow \nthem to more fully maximize the benefits of development of irrigation in Chhattisgarh. Water \nmanagement  is  inadequate,  with  insufficient  canal  networks  and  structures  and  limited \noperational orientation toward effective water regulation and distribution. Adequate funds do not \nexist to facilitate regular inspection or prioritization of maintenance and rehabilitation needs, and \nstandardized procedures for O&M are lacking or outdated in many cases. Maintenance has also \nbeen neglected due to little farmer participation and lack of funding and skills for water users \nassociations (WUAs) to conduct O&M. WRD typically collects only about 20\u201325% of the annual \nirrigation service fees from farmers, largely due to poor service delivery. Over 80% of WRD\u2019s \nO&M budget is for establishment costs, with little remaining for field activities. Thus, considerable \nscope exists for WRD to improve service delivery and financial sustainability. \n8.  Inadequate system design, irregular field-to-field irrigation, and the need to improve water \nmanagement limit opportunities for dry season (rabi) cropping from December to March. System \noperational rules are oriented toward kharif paddy production with little water remaining in storage \nto irrigate rabi crops. Farmers build large field bunds to trap monsoon rains, and supplemental \nirrigation water is imprecisely applied to kharif rice, which precludes efficient use of fertilizers and \nother inputs. Rabi and diversified crops require more controlled delivery of irrigation than is \npossible with the existing systems. \n9.  Although Chhattisgarh's current agricultural development policies advocate diversified and \nrabi cropping, agricultural practices need improvement to achieve these goals. Field staff from the \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  (DA)  require  additional  capacity  and  resources  to  deliver  support \nservices effectively. Most farmers are inexperienced in growing anything but kharif rice, which \nprovides food security, with the surplus sold in the market. Farmers have access to fertilizers, \nagrochemicals, and seeds through rural cooperatives located throughout the state and from \nprivate vendors, but fertilizer field application is about half the national average. Government farm \n                                                 \n4  Net per capita production in Chhattisgarh in 2002 and 2003 was lower than that of all but five other Indian states. \nEconomic growth in the last decade for Chhattisgarh ranged from 1.17 to 4.36% while the national average ranged \nfrom 4.91 to 7.83%. ", "3 \ncredit  is  available  mainly  through  rural  cooperative  societies  and  private  moneylenders.5 \nHowever, one of the largest constraints to adequate input application is farmers' reluctance to \nborrow  funds  since  a  reliable  water  supply  cannot  be  assured  to  support  their  investment. \nChhattisgarh has a mature rice milling industry (over 700 mills) and a well-developed marketing \nsystem (170 wholesale and 1,679 primary rural markets), partly because it used to supply over \n70% of the rice for the undivided Madhya Pradesh (MP).6 Farmers sell to both private and state \ntraders,  although  subsistence  production  is  important  due  to  widespread  food  insecurity. \nProduction of crops such as maize, gram, and other pulses, oilseed, and vegetables has been \nrising in recent years, confirming that demand, farmer responsiveness, and markets exist for rabi \nand  diversified  crops.  In  many  cases,  farmers  simply  require  more  reliable  water  supply, \nimproved knowledge, and more experience in growing rabi and diversified crops for a sustainable \nchange in agricultural practice (Appendix 3). \n10.  WUAs. Chhattisgarh retained the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) Act that was \npassed in 1999 when the state was part of MP. About 946 WUAs were created on over 1.13 \nmillion ha to support irrigation system O&M, however, many of the WUAs are not active or \neffective since they were never mobilized and have received no capacity development. Farmers \nare supportive of a greater role in irrigation system  management, but WUAs need skills in \nleadership, water management, O&M, and financial management to become effective. Farmers \nand WUAs have a much greater incentive for effective water management and O&M than WRD, \nbut they need secure financial resources to support their efforts.7 \n11.  Although  the  PIM  Act  recognizes  WUAs  and  provides  a  legal  basis  for  farmer \nparticipation, a strengthened institutional framework for WUAs is needed that (i) more clearly \ndefines  the  role  of  WUAs  and  gives  them  authority  for system  management  and  O&M;  (ii) \nenhances resources flowing to WUAs for O&M, preferably through direct sharing of the irrigation \nservice fee (ISF) revenues;8 and (iii) improves representation of irrigators including (a) at least \none  dedicated  WUA  for  irrigation  schemes  of  200  ha  or  larger;  (b)  membership  given  to \nhouseholds so that both women and men can attend meetings, vote, and run for office; and (c) \nparticipation of sharecroppers. Although some reforms could be achieved within the existing legal \nframework, passage of a revised PIM Act will be the most effective means for change. \n12.  Other Indian States, notably Andhra Pradesh, have had good results using PIM as an \nintegral strategy to promote reforms for improved service delivery in the irrigation sector. The \nAndhra  Pradesh  program,  which  was  World  Bank  assisted,  combined  significant  capacity \ndevelopment for WUAs, irrigation rehabilitation, and improved O&M funds and achieved the \nfollowing successes: (i) effective irrigation utilization doubled in some command areas; (ii) overall \nwater usage declined by as much as one third due to better water management by WUAs even \nthough the irrigated areas increased; (iii) and the percentage of farmers paying their irrigation \nfees increased significantly since the WUAs would receive the funds for O&M even though the \nfees were increased by as much as three times the previous rate (Appendix 3). \n13.  WRD. WRD currently has the technical capacity to develop and manage irrigation, and its \nplanning framework calls for significant expansion of the irrigated area. However, institutional \nanalysis during project preparation indicated that the development impact could be significantly \nincreased  and  more  sustainable  if  the  following  were  integrated  into  WRD's  irrigation \ndevelopment  and  management  practices:  improved  irrigation  designs;  more  effective  water \nmanagement; more sustainable O&M; agricultural support services; and increased participation of \nWUAs. \n                                                 \n5  In the survey during project preparation, 45% of the respondents used Government loans, 40% used private \nmoneylenders, and 15% used their own resources for farming. \n6  Chhattisgarh used to be part of Madhya Pradesh until the state was bifurcated in 2000, creating Chhattisgarh. \n7  Currently WRD is supposed to give WUAs Rs40 per ha, but funds are not available in many cases. \n8  Irrigation service fees are called \"water tax\" in Chhattisgarh. \n ", "4 \n14.  Although Chhattisgarh faces constraints as a new state with maturing capacity and an \nevolving  policy  framework,  many  fundamentals  are  in  place  for  dynamic  growth  in  irrigated \nagriculture. Chhattisgarh is investing substantial resources in irrigation and water resources, but \nneeds assistance in (i) redefining and clarifying roles and responsibilities of WUAs, WRD, and \nother sector stakeholders; (ii) strengthening institutional frameworks; and (iii) developing capacity \nto achieve the maximum potential from their substantial public investment. Chhattisgarh has \nshown a strong commitment to undertaking the necessary reforms and action to increase the \neffectiveness of irrigated agriculture, and, with Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance, offers \ntremendous potential for increased agricultural productivity and improved rural livelihood. \n15.  ADB Framework and Rationale. ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) for India, \nwhich was finalized in April 2003, states that \u201cexpansion of agriculture and rural development is \narguably the most important feature of the new strategy to mainstream poverty reduction.\u201d The \nCSP places emphasis on focal states, including Chhattisgarh, that meet the following criteria: (i) \nhigher than average poverty incidence, (ii) new states or those important for regional cooperation, \nand (iii) a strong commitment to reform. ADB\u2019s assistance to the rural sector complements India\u2019s \n10th Five-Year Plan that focuses on promoting equitable growth through sustainable agriculture \nand rural development. Chhattisgarh\u2019s own development plans call for increasing the primary \nsector\u2019s contribution to the state economy by 50% over the next 10 years. The development \nobjectives of ADB, Government of India, and GOCG are mutually reinforcing and provide a \nframework to support investment in irrigated agriculture in Chhattisgarh (Appendix 4). \n16.  Coordination of the Project with existing and planned ADB support in Chhattisgarh will \nprovide synergistic benefits to enhance development impact in the rural sector. The approved \nChhattisgarh State Roads Development Sector Project9 will improve connectivity of rural and \nunderdeveloped areas and economic growth areas, and will facilitate the marketing of irrigated \ncrops. The Agribusiness Development Support Project, currently under preparation, will promote \nhigh-value agriculture in Chhattisgarh, stimulating demand for more diversified cropping. \n17.  Lessons Learned. Although this is ADB's first irrigation (and rural) project in India,10 the \nWorld Bank has executed integrated irrigation and water resources management projects over \nthe last decade in Andhra Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh. Lessons \nfrom these projects include the following: (i) reforms in the irrigation sector need to penetrate \ndeeply and address interrelated issues simultaneously; (ii) reforms require the commitment of \naffected agencies and wide commitment and acceptance by all stakeholders; (iii) institutional \nchanges should be implemented and reinforced through development of physical infrastructure; \n(iv) capacity building for all institutions and stakeholders in water resources management and \nirrigation is essential; (v) development and participation of WUAs and farmers are vital elements \nof reform; and (vi) a focus on project (and subproject) management is essential to (a) strengthen \nadministrative capacity for effective implementation and disbursement, (b) ensure safeguards, \nand (c) develop effective  monitoring and evaluation systems. ADB\u2019s experience with WUAs \nacross Asia has shown that (i) WUA development is a long-term process, (ii) WUAs need to be \ninvolved in all aspects of irrigation development (including rehabilitation) and management for \nsustainable  O&M  and  improved  service  delivery,  (iii)  executing  agencies  require  focused \nengagement and capacity development to create  effective WUAs, and (iv) an  emphasis on \nfinancial resources and O&M is necessary for sustainable improvements. More broadly, ADB's \nexperience  with  agriculture  projects  has  shown  the  need  for  realism  in  estimating  project \neconomic rates of return, which have proven particularly sensitive to rice prices and to the assumed \nlevels of cropping intensity, input use, and productivity. \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2003.

The overall project goal is to improve rural livelihoods and reduce rural poverty through \nimproved irrigation service delivery, enhanced agricultural practices, and strengthened water \nresources management to increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture in Chhattisgarh. The \nProject has the following interrelated objectives: (i) improve the ability of WRD to develop and \nmanage  the  irrigation  sector;  (ii)  develop  the  ability  of  WUAs  to  play  a  principal  role  in \nmanagement and O&M of irrigation systems; (iii) rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of minor and \nmedium irrigation systems through a participatory process with WUAs; and (iv) enhance the \nWUAs' and farmers' agricultural practices with emphasis on rabi cropping. \nB.  Components and Outputs \n19.  The Project has four components. \n1.  Strengthening WRD \n20.  Institutional Reforms within WRD. Within WRD, the Project will strengthen existing \ncapacity  and  support  new  activities  and  institutional  arrangements  to  maximize  the  project \ndevelopment objectives and improve overall management and development of irrigation systems. \nThe following new operational units will be developed for WRD operations under the Project: (i) \nPIM Unit that will mobilize and train WUAs (within 1 month of loan effectiveness); (ii) Design Unit \n(with survey team) for project R&U and WRD design activities; (iii) Social Development Unit \n(SDU)  that  will  be  responsible  for  social  assessment,  resettlement,  indigenous  peoples, \nenvironment, and economic analysis of R&U subprojects design (SDU and Design Unit within 4 \nmonths of loan effectiveness); and (iv) Dam Safety Unit (within 12 months of loan effectiveness). \nThe consultants will assist WRD to upgrade overall WRD procedures to strengthen irrigation \ndevelopment and management. \n21.  WRD Capacity Development. WRD capacity development will (i) augment the existing \nskills mix to support the project objectives, (ii) establish the functional capacity of the new units, \nand  (iii)  improve  overall  performance  of  WRD  technical  and  nontechnical  functions.11  The \nconsultants will create capacity development curricula in consultation with WRD, and training will \nbe coordinated through the four chief engineers\u2019 (CE) offices. Consultants and trained WRD staff \nwill deliver seminar programs and field training during and after the Project. Exposure to improved \nmethods for irrigation development and management will also be accomplished through topical \nworkshops and staff attendance at national and regional events. \n22.  To enhance WRD's technical and management capacity, establish the new units, and \nfacilitate capacity development, the Project will modernize equipment and develop new facilities. \nComputer-assisted survey and design equipment will support project R&U and be used to train \nstaff  for  improved  irrigation  design.  The  Project  will  introduce  computer  and  information \ntechnology (IT) equipment in the four CE offices, WRD headquarters, new WRD units, the project \nmanagement unit (PMU), and training centers. Extensive IT training will be provided to enhance \nWRD's  capacity  to  develop  and  maintain  management  information  systems  for  project \nimplementation and for more effective management, monitoring, and administrative procedures.12 \n                                                 \n11  WRD capacity development specific to project objectives may include (i) participatory irrigation design; (ii) WUA \nformation, development, and support; (iii) dam safety, design, and management; (iv) social, environmental, and \neconomic assessment; and (v) project economic analysis. Capacity development will also address general WRD \ntechnical and management practices and may include (i) irrigation design, (ii) modern survey techniques, (iii) \nhydrology, (iv) water management and systems operation, (v) geotechnical assessment, (vi) construction management \nand quality control, and (vii) management information systems and information technology (IT). \n12  As acceptance of IT grows, it may be expanded to district offices. \n ", "6 \nThe Project will establish four regional training centers for WRD, WUA, and farmer capacity \ndevelopment. \n2.  Participatory Irrigation Management \n23.  Strengthening the Institutional Framework and WUA Mobilization. Redefining and \nstrengthening  the  roles,  responsibilities,  and  authority  for  irrigation  management  and  O&M \nbetween WRD and WUAs to improve irrigation sector performance are important goals of the \nProject. The Project supports strengthening the institutional framework, including a revised PIM \nAct13 with the following policy changes: (i) ensuring that irrigation systems that receive R&U will \nhave their own WUA to be responsible for O&M, and (ii) ensuring direct fund flows from ISF \n(footnote  10)  to  WUAs  for  sustainable  O&M.  The  Project  will  contract  a  nongovernment \norganization (NGO) to conduct an awareness campaign about revised PIM policies, basic WUA \norganization, and the planned WUA elections to start the WUA development process. Elections \nare currently scheduled for June 2005 under the existing PIM Act and may be delayed to ensure \nthe new WUAs and officers come under the auspices of the revised PIM Act. This delay may be \nnecessary to allow the Project consultants and WRD to develop the revised PIM Act and for \npassage of the revised PIM by the legislative assembly. Although this initial mobilization will be \nfor all WUAs in Chhattisgarh, schemes targeted for R&U (based on technical criteria) will be \nprioritized. \n24.  WUA Capacity Development and Support. Consultants will train WRD staff for the PIM \nUnit and provide capacity development to ensure that WUAs: (i) manage irrigation systems \neffectively, (ii) provide sustainable O&M, and (iii) develop rabi and diversified cropping. The \nfollowing activities will take place during year 1 of the Project: (i) mobilize WUAs; (ii) establish the \nPIM  Unit;  (iii)  develop  modules  and  activities  for  the  WUA  Capacity  Development  Program \n(WUACDP); (iv) train trainers (NGO and WRD staff) for the WUACDP; and (v) formulate a \nstrategy, schedule, and logistics for WUACDP. WRD has designated a PIM Unit chief and other \nstaff positions for PIM field offices at the four training centers. \n25.  An NGO will be recruited to support the PIM Unit with WUACDP delivery over the first 5 \nyears of the Project until adequate WRD staff can be trained. The PIM Unit will deliver WUACDP \nactivities primarily at the village level and activities will be coordinated through the four regional \ntraining centers that will house regional PIM units.14 The regional PIM Unit will organize field \ndelivery of WUACDP activities through local WRD and DA offices, and local rural government \n(panchayat) or other local meeting facilities. All WUA leaders will receive core WUACDP training. \nWUACDP modules will provide basic skills covering (i) WUA management and leadership, (ii) \nfinancial management, (iii) conflict resolution, (iv) irrigation system O&M, (v) water management, (vi) \nagricultural development, and (vii) gender development. In addition, training will be offered at the \nregional centers and to all WUA members. \n26.  In systems that receive R&U, the regional PIM Unit staff will work with WUAs in the field to \nprepare water management plans, rabi cropping and marketing plans, and O&M plans. All WUAs \nthat successfully complete WUACDP will receive a one-time grant of Rs22,500 for estimated \norganizational start-up costs, administration, and O&M equipment. In R&U systems, the one-time \nstart-up grant will be Rs45,000 to help ensure adequate support for management and O&M of the \nupgraded facilities, and these WUAs will receive transitional O&M funds on a declining basis. The \n                                                 \n13  The Project will support (i) a revised PIM Act with implementing rules and regulations; (ii) a model contract for WRD \nand WUAs to specify roles, responsibilities, and authority for irrigation management and O&M; and (iii) a set of by-\nlaws that define obligations between a WUA and its members. \n14  Regional training centers and PIM units will be located at Ambikapur, Bilaspur, Jagdalpur, and Raipur. Each regional \nPIM unit will include (i) a WRD regional PIM officer, (ii) WUACDP regional coordinator, (iii) 3\u20136 WUACDP specialists, \n(iv) one deputy director from Department of Agriculture, and (v) one or more irrigated agriculture specialists. Exact \nstaff numbers at each center will depend on the demand for services in the area. GOCG will provide interim facilities. ", "7 \nPIM Unit will support WUAs in R&U systems throughout the life of the Project, and assist WUAs \nto develop and maintain monitoring and evaluation systems. \n3.  Rehabilitation and Upgrading of Irrigation Systems  \n27.  Pilot Rehabilitation and Upgrading Works. R&U will fully involve the WUAs in needs \nassessment,  design,  and  construction  supervision.  The  PIM  Unit  will  coordinate  WUA \ninvolvement  in  R&U  after  the  members  complete  the  WUACDP.  It  is  anticipated  that  the \nWUACDP and PIM Unit may take a year to become fully operational, so that at the beginning of \nthe Project, pilot procedures will be used to (i) select schemes,15 (ii) train WUAs, and (iii) design \nand execute R&U. The pilot R&U will refine the process for WUA participation in R&U and will \ndemonstrate project benefits to other WUAs and WRD field staff. Projects and WUAs selected for \nthe pilot R&U will include the four subprojects that were prepared during the project preparatory \ntechnical  assistance  (PPTA)16  and  eight  additional  projects,  with  selection  based  on  project \ntechnical criteria and discussion with WRD and the PIM Unit. The pilot phase for R&U will begin \nin year 1 of the Project. \n28.  Framework  for  Subproject  Selection.  The  Project  will  provide  R&U  for  minor  and \nmedium irrigation systems. Selecting systems, especially minor ones, with a high potential for rabi \ncropping is essential to (i) ensure project viability, (ii) sustain the effectiveness of WUAs, and \n(iii) increase agricultural productivity. Initial screening of subprojects will be based on (i) size, (ii) \nreservoir condition, and (iii) water availability in order to eliminate systems with little potential for \nrabi cropping.17 Appendix 5 gives the selection criteria. After technical screening, the PIM and \nSDU units, WUAs, and WRD field staff will conduct an initial assessment to evaluate the systems' \nphysical, social (including poverty, resettlement, and indigenous peoples) and environmental \nconditions  and  economic  viability.  Schemes  with  high  potential  for  economic  returns  and \ncommunity benefits will be prioritized,18 and WUA willingness to participate in the rehabilitation \nprocess, provide O&M, and pursue rabi cropping will be factored into the final selection. WUAs in \nsystems that meet technical subproject screening criteria will be prioritized for WUACDP, so they \ncan be trained, their commitment assessed, and schemes selected for R&U. The project target \nfor R&U is approximately 200 minor schemes and 20 medium schemes, a total of about 200,000 \nha of R&U that will be sequenced over the last 6 years of the Project. \n29.  Rehabilitation and Upgrading Program. Following the pilot subprojects and starting in \nyear 2, the R&U program will begin and will be executed in two stages. After the initial appraisal \nand the system's topographical survey, stage 1 of the R&U will start with a comprehensive field \nassessment to (i) identify R&U needs, (ii) explore design options, and (iii) define the O&M \nimplications of the design options. The assessment will involve WUAs, farmers, WRD staff, and \nthe Design and PIM units. Once agreement on R&U works is reached, the Design Unit and field \noffices will finalize designs and prepare tender documents that will require endorsement by the \nWUA. WRD field offices will execute R&U contracting using standard WRD procedures that are \nmodified to comply with ADB guidelines and loan assurances. WUAs will supervise construction \nwith WRD, and WUA agreement will be required before the release of final payment to the \ncontractor. The PIM Unit will train and assist WUAs to participate in the R&U process. \n                                                 \n15  The same technical criteria will be used for pilot subproject selection (Appendix 5). \n16 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Sector Project. \nManila. \n17  Of WRD's 2,000 minor schemes, it is estimated that between 300 and 600 will meet the technical criteria with an \naverage size of 500 ha. Many of the existing 29 medium schemes, which average 5,000 ha, will meet the technical \ncriteria. At present, not all subprojects have been selected, but the criteria and methodology are in place for their \nselection. Numerous potential subprojects were identified during the PPTA without detailed investigation. R&U will be \nundertaken up to the limit of the project funds. \n18  A basic indicator is schemes that have very low utilization of irrigation potential relative to the design potential. \n ", "8 \n30.  Stage  2  of  R&U  is  development  of  field  channels  and  associated  on-farm  water \nmanagement activities that require WUA decisions regarding: (i) distribution of rabi water, which \nwill normally be insufficient to irrigate the entire system;19 (ii) extent of field channels and their \nrouting; (iii) WUA responsibilities for water management; and (iv) rabi cropping plans. Therefore, \nfield channels and on-farm water management activities will not be included in stage 1 of R&U.20 \nIn the year following stage 1 R&U works and after the WUAs have experience with the new \nstructures, PIM Unit staff will work with the WUAs to develop (i) field channels, (ii) on-farm water \nmanagement plans, and (iii) rabi cropping and marketing plans. After the WUA has submitted \nplans for field channels, on-farm activities, and rabi cropping and marketing to the PIM Unit, the \nProject will support materials and technical supervision to install field channels and associated \nworks, and WUAs will provide land and labor. \n31.  Priority Program for Sluice Repair. System-wide R&U will be limited to systems that \nmeet the R&U selection criteria, but the Project will provide assistance to all WUAs in minor and \nmedium schemes with tanks that have dysfunctional sluice gates. Gate repair should (i) not \nrequire major civil works, (ii) be economically justified, and (iii) involve a system where the \ncommand area is able to benefit from the water supplied. WUAs in the WUACDP will be able to \nrequest inspection for sluice repair, and the responsible executive engineer for the system and \nWUAs will form a team to manage needed repairs for the priority scheme. WUAs will help \ndetermine  the  needed  repairs,  develop  an  O&M  plan,  and  endorse  the  final  works.  This \nsubcomponent, which starts in year 2 of the Project, will target 500 subprojects. \n4.  Agricultural Support Services  \n32.  The Project will provide agricultural support services for systems that have undergone \nR&U. The PIM Unit will work directly with WUA members in their own irrigation system to assess \nproblems and define strategies to improve productivity in their particular context. Eight irrigated \nagriculture specialists to be based in the regional PIM units will be recruited as part of the PIM \nNGO support. The DA will provide a full-time deputy director to work at each regional PIM Unit \nand to help coordinate local DA staff and programs to support WUAs in the subproject areas. The \nPIM Unit agricultural support staff will work closely with WUAs on a long-term basis to identify the \nlinkages between water management and cropping potential, and will assist WUAs at every step \nof  agricultural  production,  from  selection  and  application  of  inputs  to  identification  of  local \nmarkets. The same staff will link WUAs with relevant specialists at Indira Gandhi Agricultural \nUniversity in Raipur, private sector vendors, and other agricultural support resources. Considering \npresent cropping practices and market potential, the initial focus is expected to be on improving \nyield and quality, and hence, market value of kharif rice varieties, and improving the productivity \nof rabi pulses and oilseeds. Over time, rabi cropping should diversify into more commercial crops, \nand diversification should spread to kharif season.  \n33.  The Project's diversified cropping program will support demonstration and small-scale \nassistance projects to promote rabi and diversified cropping. The PIM Unit will work with WUAs to \ndevelop proposals for project support including seed and input trials. Proposals will be submitted \nwhen rabi cropping and marketing plans are completed by WUAs. Installation of field channels or \nan on-farm water management plan is a prerequisite to avail of funds. Project support through the \ndiversified cropping program will be provided as grants to WUAs through the PIM Unit, based on \nthe number of hectares of rabi or diversified crops. PIM Unit staff will also facilitate farm-to-farm \nand WUA-to-WUA demonstrations of successful rabi cropping to share farmer experiences. \n                                                 \n19  It is estimated that, on average, sufficient water will be available for rabi season on 30-50% of the rehabilitated area, \ndepending on rainfall, storage capacity, and irrigation efficiency during kharif season. \n20  Outlets may also be delayed to stage 2 of the R&U works if WUA consensus on their location cannot be achieved. ", "9 \nC.  Special Features \n34.  Focus on Sustainability and Participation. A key to achieving sustainability, especially \nfor O&M, is WUA participation. WUAs have a stronger incentive to execute O&M since farmers' \nlivelihoods are directly dependent on system performance. Participation of WUAs in R&U works \nwill (i) foster a sense of ownership and reinforce responsibility to maintain the irrigation system, \nand  (ii)  build  the  capacity  of  WUAs  to  operate  the  system  effectively  and  to  appreciate \nmaintenance needs. System R&U will increase the incentive for WUA maintenance since some \nsystems are currently so degraded that any O&M investment is futile. Project O&M funds will be \nprovided on a declining basis following R&U, while contributions from WUAs increase as system \nperformance and productivity improve. Policy changes to ensure that farmers play a meaningful \nrole in system management and that financial resources flow to WUAs are key measures for \nO&M sustainability, not only in R&U subprojects, but for all irrigation systems in Chhattisgarh. \n35.  Integrated Approach. A vital project objective is to increase the productivity of irrigated \nagriculture in Chhattisgarh. The Project explicitly recognizes that improved water management \nand agricultural support services are critical to facilitate rabi cropping and optimize productivity \nincreases from R&U works. These activities are an integral part of the project design and will help \nachieve benefits that would not be possible with R&U works alone. \n36.  Gender. The Project acknowledges institutional, social, and cultural barriers to women's \nempowerment and the impact this may have on access to and participation in activities related to \nirrigation and water resources. The Project provides measures to promote the interests of women \nand to ensure gender equity in governance and decision-making processes (Appendix 2). The \nrevised PIM Act will designate households as members of WUAs, so that both women and men \ncan attend meetings, vote, and stand for election. WUAs will have a female representative on the \nmanagement committee and all subcommittees, with an overall target representation of 30% \nwomen on all committees. A WUA gender subcommittee will address (i) the needs of women \ntitleholders and WUA members; (ii) women farm laborers; (iii) developing and protecting access \nto  irrigation  water  for  alternative  uses  such  as  home  gardens,  livestock,  and  domestic \nconsumption;  and  (iv)  creation  of  capacity  development  and  livelihood  programs  targeting \nwomen. The Project calls for an initial 10% representation by women as PIM Unit trainers who \nare contracted through project funds, growing to 20% by year 3 of the Project. \nD.  Cost Estimates \n37.  The total project cost is estimated at $66.6 million equivalent inclusive of taxes, duties, \nand  interest  and  other  charges  on  the  loan  during  implementation  (Table  1).  The  foreign \nexchange cost (including interest and commitment charges) is estimated at $15.9 million.

Financing Plan \n38.  India has requested a loan of $46,108,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help \nfinance 69% of the project cost. The loan will finance the foreign exchange cost excluding the \ncommitment  charges,  and  interest  on  the  loan  during  construction  as  well  as  $37.9  million \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government of India will finance the foreign exchange \ncost comprising interest, commitment charge, and other charges on the loan during construction. \nThe  Government  of  Chhattisgarh  will  support  local  currency  costs  of  $12.2  million.  The \nbeneficiaries  will  fund  $0.6  million  equivalent  of  the  local  costs  through  in-kind  labor  and \ncontribution of land right of way for field channels (Table 2).

Implementation Period. The Project will be implemented over 7  years (2005\u20132012) \ninclusive of all activities. The implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. Initial emphasis will be on \ndeveloping the capacity of WUAs and defining procedures for the R&U process. Subprojects \nprepared under the PPTA and eight additional subprojects to be prepared in 2005 will be ready \nfor contract award by 2006. Lessons learned from the pilot activity will feed into the procedures \nfor subsequent subproject development. Subproject implementation plans will be prepared each \nyear based on the selection criteria and WUA demand. Construction of stage 1 R&U works for \nsubprojects will start after the monsoon and field channel installation will take place in the year \nfollowing canal works. The priority sluice repair program will begin in 2005. \n41.  Executing Agency. WRD has the mandate for planning, implementing, and operating \nirrigation schemes in Chhattisgarh and will be the Executing Agency. WRD has demonstrated the \ncapacity to implement subproject physical works and has made a commitment to introduce the \nnecessary institutional reforms and added capacity to achieve full benefits from the Project. New \nunits  for  design,  PIM,  social  development,  and  dam  safety  will  be  established.  The  project \norganization chart is in Appendix 8 and detailed implementation arrangements in Supplementary \nAppendix B. The DA will support implementation of the agricultural support services component in \nclose collaboration with the PIM Unit and will provide five deputy directors for project support. \n42.  The  PMU  will  be  established  at  WRD  in  Raipur  to  assume  overall  responsibility  for \nmanagement of all project activities including recruitment of consultants. A project director has \nbeen appointed and administrative staffing positions designated for the PMU. The project director \nwill report to the WRD secretary through the engineer-in-chief. R&U works will be implemented \n(tendering,  contracting,  accounting)  in  the  field  through  the  existing  WRD  structure.  One \naccountant from the PMU will be stationed in each of the 3 CE's zones that have eligible \nsubprojects  to  provide  support  on  ADB  procedures,  supervise  monitoring,  and  coordinate \nreporting of procurement and financial information to the PMU. \n43.  Project Coordination. A project steering committee chaired by the chief secretary and \ncomprising secretary-level members from concerned departments21 was formed for the PPTA \nand has been extended for the Project. The project steering committee will meet at least yearly or \nat the request of the chief secretary to provide policy guidance and review project performance. A \nproject technical coordination committee chaired by the WRD secretary and comprising of high-\nranking technical officers from line agencies will be formed within 3 months of loan effectiveness \nto coordinate project implementation and technical issues. A WRD working group under the \nproject director has been established to revise the PIM Act and to address WUA issues. \n2.  Procurement \n44.  Procurement financed from the ADB loan proceeds will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works costing over $3 million will be procured through \ninternational competitive bidding (ICB) procedures, and those estimated to cost $3 million or less \nwill  be  procured  through  local  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB. \nIndicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9. Civil works will be procured from prequalified \nbidders  based  on  WRD\u2019s  existing  procedures  for  prequalification  and  selection  of  contracts \nconsistent  with  ADB  guidelines.  Several  proximate  minor  schemes  targeted  for  R&U \nsimultaneously may be bundled into one contract package. Field channel works will be done \n                                                 \n21  Members of the committee are the chief secretary (chair), and the principal secretaries of the departments of water \nresources, agriculture, forest and environment, fisheries, tribal welfare, panchayat and rural development, and \nfinance.  \n ", "12 \nthrough a combination of LCB contracts and in-kind contribution and contracted labor by WUAs. \nMinor works under the priority sluice program will be implemented through LCB with appropriate \ncommunity participation. Vehicles, equipment, and materials valued at more than $500,000 will \nbe procured by ICB, and those valued at $500,000 or less through LCB. Small or off-the-shelf \ngoods  and  materials  valued  at  less  than  $100,000  may  be  procured  using  direct  purchase \narrangements. \n45.  To support timely contract approvals while ensuring sound practice and accountability, \npost facto approval procedures will be adopted for LCB civil works contracts. For the first five \ncontract packages under LCB from each of the 3 CE zones, WRD will submit the procurement \ndocuments and bid evaluation for ADB review and approval before awarding the contract. If ADB \nfinds  the  documents  and  evaluation  satisfactory,  WRD  will  proceed  with  procurement  and \ncontract award for subsequent contract packages without prior ADB approval. In these cases, \nWRD  will  retain  a  record  of  all  procurement  documentation,  including  copies  of  the  signed \ncontract and the bid evaluation report, for inspection during ADB project supervision missions or \non request. The procurement processes and contract awards will be audited annually as part of \nthe performance audit. If any contract award is found unacceptable, ADB may refuse to finance \nthe contract. \n3.  Consulting Services \n46.  The  Project  will  require  an  estimated  382  person-months  of  consulting  services:  92 \ninternational and 290 domestic. Project consultants are listed in Appendix 10 and their terms of \nreference (TOR) in Supplementary Appendix C (additional consulting services will be financed \nthrough a grant from the Government of the United Kingdom). This input reflects the support \nnecessary for institutional and capacity development to introduce new concepts in the PIM, Social \nDevelopment, and Dam Safety Units to maximize development impact and ensure sustainability. \nNGOs  will  be  contracted  to  support  implementation  of  project  activities  through  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting domestic consultants. \nThe quality- and cost-based selection method will be used to select consulting firms (Appendix 9 \nhas recruitment details). For expedient mobilization of the Project, WRD has requested ADB to \nrecruit the project management consultants, who will be responsible for recruiting NGO support \npackages. \n4.  Advance Procurement Action \n47.  Consultant support needs to be established promptly to develop WUA and WRD capacity \nand maximize project objectives. ADB management has approved advance action to cover the \nperiod from the end of the Appraisal Mission until loan effectiveness. The issuance of invitations \nfor  proposals  under  advance  procurement  action  will  be  subject  to  ADB  approval.  The \nGovernment was advised that ADB approval of advance action does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project. \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n48.  Loan disbursements and maintenance of imprest accounts will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (January 2001) and Interim Guidelines for Disbursement \nOperations, LIBOR-Based Loan Product (July 2002) as amended from time to time. ADB will \nprovide  the  Borrower  with  an  imprest  advance  that  will  not  exceed  3  months'  estimated \nexpenditure or 5% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The controller of aid accounts and \naudit in the Ministry of Finance of the Borrower will maintain the imprest account in the Reserve \nBank of India, and pass on the rupee equivalent to WRD through the Finance Department of \nGOCG. WRD will establish a second-generation imprest account (SGIA) as a no-interest current \naccount with a commercial bank acceptable to ADB. The Ministry of Finance of the Borrower and ", "13 \nGOCG have assured that the entire proceeds of the imprest advance would be creditied to the \nSGIA within 30 days of ADB disbursement. The SGIA proceeds may be used to make any \npayments for eligible expenditures by WRD. For individual payments not exceeding $50,000, \nWRD may adopt the statement-of-expenditure (SOE) procedure for claiming reimbursement and \nliquidating of the imprest fund. The Ministry of Finance of the Borrower will be responsible for \nmonitoring  WRD's  SGIA,  including  monthly  reconciliation  of  accounts  and  preparation  of \nwithdrawal applications for liquidation/replenishment of the accounts. \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n49.  The PMU will prepare monthly financial statements and quarterly progress reports that \ndetail the (i) physical and financial progress of activities against the targets, (ii) progress on the \ninstitutional and capacity aspects, (iii) issues affecting project implementation and their corrective \nmeasures,  and  (iv)  other  agreed  upon  monitoring  parameters.  WRD  will  also  prepare  a \ncomprehensive  annual  report.  WRD  will  submit  reports  to  ADB  and  the  Ministry  of  Water \nResources, Government of India no later than 1 month after the reporting period. Within 3 months \nof  physical  completion  of  the  Project,  the  Government  will  submit  a  comprehensive  project \ncompletion report in ADB\u2019s standard format with additional details as may be requested by ADB. \n50.  WRD, with PMU assistance, will maintain separate records and accounts in accordance \nwith generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and adequate to identify \ngoods and services financed from the loan proceeds; the expenditures incurred for the Project \nand subprojects; and use of local funds. These accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The Government will submit to ADB consolidated annual audited reports and \nrelated financial statements from the Project within 9 months after the end of each fiscal year. \nThe audit of the imprest account, SGIAs, and SOE will be carried out as part of the regular annual \naudit. The auditor\u2019s assessment of the examination relating to the imprest accounts, SGIAs, and \nSOE should be separately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. ADB may audit project accounts during \nreview missions. \n7.  Operation and Maintenance \n51.  The Project ensures increased resources, improved capacity, and better incentives to \nsupport O&M. GOCG and ADB have discussed policy changes that will ensure a portion of the \nISF (water tax) will go directly to the WUAs for O&M support.22 GOCG has assured ADB it will \nreview current rates for irrigation service in light of the needs for O&M, and WUA and WRD cost \nsharing. This review is consistent with the Ministry of Water Resources policy on rationalized \nrates for irrigation service. Under the Project, funds for O&M support will be provided to WUAs on \na declining basis for the first 3 years following R&U activities.23 As project funds diminish, WUA \nO&M support will increase through their share of the irrigation fee as service delivery improves, \nrabi cropping expands, and WUA members realize the benefits from their O&M support. Since \ntheir livelihoods depend on irrigation performance, WUAs have a greater incentive to ensure \nadequate O&M.24 Increased rabi cropping will promote better O&M since less water is available \nduring the rabi season and more precise water control is required for rabi crops. WUAs will \n                                                 \n22  Until such time that policy changes, the Government has committed to make payments to WUAs in accordance with \nthe existing policy of Rs40 per ha. \n23  Following R&U, WUAs will be given Rs90 per ha in the first year, Rs80 per ha in the second year, and Rs70 per ha in  \nthe third year to support O&M. For schemes developed late in the Project, the annual payments will be consolidated \nand disbursed to WUAs over the remaining time of the Project. \n24  It is anticipated that WRD will retain O&M responsibilities for the reservoir, head works, and large structures/canals, \nespecially in medium-size systems. In some minor systems, WUAs may essentially assume full responsibility for \nO&M. \n ", "14 \nreceive capacity development and technical support for O&M and be required to create O&M \nplans as a condition for R&U. \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n52.  Within 4 months of loan effectiveness, the PMU will establish performance monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) procedures acceptable to ADB. The M&E parameters will be developed as a \npart of the project administration memorandum (PAM) with assistance from ADB and the M&E \nconsultants. The M&E system will be a critical component and will be developed in accordance \nwith  ADB's  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS).  Baseline  information  will  be \ncollected as part of the subproject feasibility assessment process. Thereafter, surveys will be \nconducted annually. The scope of the survey, quantity and quality of data, and frequency of \ncollection  will  be  guided  by  project  management  needs  for  progressive  feedback  on \nimplementation  status  and  early  warning  on  situations  that  might  jeopardize  development \nobjectives. Subproject monitoring will be conducted by the PMU, WRD, and WUAs, and reviewed \nand audited closely by ADB. \n9.  Project Review \n53.  During the initial 3 years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual reviews to (i) determine \nif  implementation  arrangements  are  in  place  and  appropriate,  (ii)  assess  progress  in \nimplementing institutional reforms and capacity development, (iii) review subproject selection and \nimplementation,  (iv)  ensure  ADB  safeguards,  and  (v)  assess  any  unforeseen  impacts.  By \nDecember 2008, ADB, the Government of India, and GOCG will undertake a comprehensive \nmidterm review (MTR) to identify problems in implementation arrangements and define needed \nchanges to achieve the project objectives. Two months before the MTR, WRD will submit to ADB \na detailed progress report on project implementation. TOR for the MTR will be included in the \nPAM to be prepared by ADB\u2019s Inception Mission for the Project. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n54.  A TA for capacity development will be financed by a grant from the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom to develop the capacity of (i) WUAs to assume responsibility for irrigation system \nmanagement and O&M, and (ii) WUAs and farmers to adopt diversified and rabi cropping. The TA \nwill support M&E that involves all stakeholders with a focus on livelihood impacts. TA activities \nwill be directly integrated with the Project to support consultants under the WUA strengthening \nand agricultural support services project components. The following will be directly or indirectly \nsupported by the TA: (i) development of the WUACDP that will provide WUA training; (ii) training \nof trainers for contracted and WRD staff; (iii) development of the process for WUA participation in \nirrigation system R&U; (iv) strengthening the institutional framework of PIM and WUAs; (v) a \ncapacity development program to assist WUAs and farmers with improved farm practices; and \n(vi) development of a comprehensive M&E program in accordance with the PPMS. The total TA \ncost is $2,375,000. The Government of the United Kingdom will finance $1.9 million of the TA \ncost on a grant basis to be administered by ADB. GOCG will contribute the remaining cost of \n$475,000 equivalent (in kind services). The detailed costs, financing plan, and brief description \nare in Appendix 11. TORs are in Supplementary Appendix C under Contract Package B. \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n55.  The overarching project benefit is increased agricultural productivity that will improve rural \nwell-being; in addition, many other benefits will accrue including improved capacity of WUAs for \nsustainable O&M, improved capacity of WRD for irrigation management and development, and \nimproved capacity of farmers for increased production of rabi and diversified crops. \n ", "15 \nA.  Economic Benefits  \n56.  The primary economic benefits of the Project will stem from the R&U works to restore the \nirrigation areas that farmers can effectively use to at least 90% of their design potential. The \nProject  will  increase  kharif  production  by  restoring  the  productivity  of  command  areas  that \ncurrently receive no irrigation and will improve effectiveness in areas receiving irrigation. The \nProject  will  support  increased  rabi  cropping  due  to  the  improved  availability  and  control  of \nirrigation water from R&U works and management changes. Technical criteria for subproject \nselection will maximize project benefits, and selection of schemes with effective WUAs will ensure \nsustainability of benefits. The PPTA prepared four core subprojects for R&U \u2013two minor schemes \nand two medium schemes\u2013 that yielded economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) ranging from \n13.7% to 33.4%. Under the Project, over 200,000 ha of land will receive R&U, resulting in a 50% \nincremental increase in kharif paddy production. Rabi paddy cropping is anticipated to increase \nby 350% from its present low base. Irrigation systems receiving R&U works will benefit 120,000 \nland-owing households or 600,000 people. Financial analysis was undertaken, and at current \nprices, which will not be influenced by the Project, the average farm family should see additional \nannual income of $180, or a 96% increase in household earnings from improved yields. Many \nmarginal and small farm families will consume a large portion of the increased production due to \nwidespread food insecurity in many communities. \n57.  Repair of irrigation water storage sluice gates will generate immediate economic benefits \nand provide a much greater incentive for farmers to maintain and manage the rest of the irrigation \nsystem more effectively. Improved O&M and agriculture practices from the WUACDP throughout \nChhattisgarh,  along  with  a  stronger  PIM  framework,  will  provide  incremental  benefits  to  all \nirrigation  systems.  Analysis  of  the  overall  project  including  the  institutional  and  capacity \ndevelopment components yields an EIRR of 22.1% (Appendix 12). \nB.  Social and Other Benefits and Impacts \n58.  Social Impacts. Based on the PPTA findings, over half the farmers who will receive \nbenefits are landless or small landholders with less than 1.5 ha. R&U and WUA management will \nprovide water and benefits to tail-end farmers who have been denied irrigation for years. For \nmany marginal farmers, the increase in production will increase food security in addition to \nhousehold  income.  The  Project  will  benefit  an  estimated  15,000  landless  rural  households \nthrough a 60% increase in labor-days that will be generated mainly during the rabi season. The \nneed for families to go out of Chhattisgarh to find seasonal employment, which is common in \nmany areas, will be reduced. The increase in irrigation system utilization will also improve the \nlivelihood of many sharecroppers who farm marginal lands in irrigation systems. \n59.  Improved  Agricultural  Practices  and  Productivity.  The  Project  will  improve  water \nmanagement and agricultural practices of farmers to increase the productivity of the agriculture \nsector in Chhattisgarh. Irrigation systems that successfully develop rabi cropping are anticipated \nto diversify into higher value crops during the kharif season. Systems that adopt successful rabi \ncropping  techniques  will  provide  examples  to  neighboring  systems.  WUA  strengthening  will \ndevelop social capital that can be leveraged for involvement in input purchases, marketing, and \nother activities to enhance productivity and incomes. \n60.  Strengthened  WRD.  Capacity  development,  enhanced  technical  resources,  and \nimproved practice will not only support successful project implementation, but will have a catalytic \neffect to increase the development impact of GOCG's own substantial irrigation investment and \ncreate far greater impact on the sector as a whole than ADB's investment alone.  \n61.  Resettlement  and  Indigenous  Peoples.  The  new  SDU  along  with  the  project \nconsultants, WRD field staff, and WUAs will address social, resettlement, indigenous persons, \nenvironment,  and  economic  analysis  activities  under  the  Project  (Appendix  13  and \n ", "16 \nSupplementary  Appendixes  D  and  E).  The  SDU  will  manage  the  initial  social  and  poverty \nassessment for subprojects, which will be conducted by a contracted NGO. SDU will review the \ninitial social and poverty assessments and consult with the design and PIM units, WRD field staff, \nand WUAs to determine if a subproject requires a resettlement plan (RP) or an indigenous \npeoples development plan (IPDP). Development of RPs and IPDPs will be supported by NGOs \nand consultants and will be implemented through district-level committees comprising the SDU, \nWRD field staff, GOCG line agencies, affected people, local officials, and other stakeholders. The \nsubprojects are not expected to generate substantial resettlement or indigenous peoples' impacts \nsince project interventions are limited to R&U for minor and medium irrigation schemes. \n62.  Environmental Impacts. Environmental impacts from the Project are not anticipated to \nbe significant. The PPTA prepared an initial environmental examination (IEE) for each of the four \nsubprojects and for the entire Project including each of the four components (Appendix 14 and \nSupplementary  Appendix  F).  The  IEE  for  the  core  subprojects  did  not  predict  impacts  of \nsignificance either during R&U construction, or after subproject completion. The IEE for the entire \nProject concluded that all the components should provide substantial environmental benefits in \nthe medium to long term except for R&U, which is not anticipated to create any negative impacts. \nThe IEE for the subproject Balar irrigation scheme, along with the environmental assessment \nreview procedures, provide an environmental framework to guide WRD and the SDU in the \nenvironmental assessment of subprojects. An IEE will be carried out for subprojects and, if \nneeded,  mitigating  measures  implemented.  An  environmental  monitoring  plan  (EMP)  will  be \nprepared for each subproject that will be supported through participation by SDU, WRD field staff, \nand WUAs. The Project has adequate budget dedicated to support development of EMPs and will \nprovide consultant support (i) for capacity development for WRD, SDU, and WUAs; and (ii) to \nassist in preparing IEEs and EMPs. \nC.  Risks \n63.  Inadequate O&M. Unless a systemic change takes place in irrigation management and \npractices, a risk is that O&M will not be adequate to ensure that subproject benefits are sustained \nafter R&U works. The Project has adopted substantial measures to ensure that O&M will be \nsustained through institutional reforms; intensive WUA capacity development for O&M; improved \nresources and transitional project O&M funds; and an improved incentive structure for O&M by \nWUAs in systems that receive the R&U works. \n64.  Failure to Develop Sustainable WUAs. Improving the capacity and effectiveness of \nWUAs is critical to (i) ensure O&M and subproject benefits are sustained, (ii) improve irrigation \nsystem operation and water management, and (iii) create an effective entry point for delivery of \nagricultural support services and facilitate change in cropping practice. A risk is that effective \nWUAs may not be formed. Intensive capacity development, project funds to help establish WUAs, \nand  agricultural  support  services  will  support  the  WUAs  as  they  coalesce  into  effective \norganizations.  The  strengthened  institutional  framework,  improved  resources,  and  capacity \ndevelopment will ensure the foundation for effective WUAs. The resulting benefits from increased \nagricultural productivity will provide a natural stimulus for farmers to participate and contribute to \nthe sustainability of the WUAs. \n65.  Less-than-Expected  Incremental  Benefits.  Project  benefits  assume  the  ability  of \nmarkets to support incremental production and farmers' willingness to expand rabi cropping. The \ntotal incremental rice output expected from the Project will be widely distributed and modest \nrelative  to  present  production  (<4%  of  Chhattisgarh  and  <0.2%  of  India),  and  no  market-\ndampening  price  impacts  are  expected.  Steady  rice  demand  in  neighboring  MP\u2015prior  to \nbifurcation,  Chhattisgarh  produced  70%  of  all  rice  in  MP\u2015and  nearby  states,  increasing \nurbanization,  and  improved  transport  will  assure  market  access.  Much  of  the  increased \nproduction will be consumed locally due to widespread food insecurity as evidenced by the fact ", "17 \nthat  69%  of  the  households  surveyed  during  project  preparation  kept  a  large  portion  their \nproduction  for  home  consumption.  A  risk  is  that  project  interventions  may  not  be  able  to \novercome the constraints to the adoption of rabi crops. The largest constraint to rabi cropping is \nunreliable irrigation, which is the central focus of the Project. Advisors on irrigated agriculture in \nthe PIM Unit will facilitate improved use of inputs and identify market opportunities. The project \napproach is to support demonstration and pilot activities, educate farmers to take advantage of \nexisting resources, and strengthen the existing linkages for inputs and markets. \n66.  Delays in Reform. The Project integrates institutional reform as an important means to \nattain  development  objectives  and  ensure  their  sustainability.  A  risk  exists  in  that  the \nimplementation of the reform agenda may be delayed. GOCG sensitization and substantial policy \ndialogue  regarding  PIM,  WUAs,  and  WRD  reforms  have  been  ongoing  throughout  project \npreparation. A national workshop on PIM held in Raipur, WRD seminars, a study tour for WRD \nofficials to other Indian states, and consultant support to prepare a revised PIM Act were all part \nof project preparation. Crucial activities under the Project will be to continue the policy dialogue, \nassure  effective  implementation  of  irrigation  management  transfer  to  WUAs,  and  improve \nirrigation performance, which will solidify beneficiary and GOCG support for the reforms. Even if a \nrevised  PIM  Act  is  not  approved,  many  reforms  can  be  achieved  within  the  existing  legal \nframework. In the absence of any reforms, project R&U works supported by WUA capacity \ndevelopment will still provide substantial benefits due to improved irrigation sector performance. \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n67.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GOCG have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  GOCG will ensure timely availability of staff, land, facilities, and funds for costs \nassociated with safeguard compliances under the Project. \n(ii)  GOCG  will  ensure  all  necessary  steps  are  taken  for  early  consideration  and \nenactment of the amended PIM Act by the state legislature; and within 6 months \nthereof, prepare rules and regulations under the Act and enforce the same in the \nsubsequent financial year starting 1 April. \n(iii)  Among other provisions, the amended PIM Act will include (a) transfer of O&M \nresponsibilities to WUAs; (b) WUAs to be provided on a timely basis (at least on \nseasonal basis) with an adequate portion of the water tax for O&M; (c) improved \nrepresentation of one or more WUAs per irrigation system for all systems above \n200 ha, and one for those below 200 ha where practicable; (d) restructuring of the \noffices, term of office, and subcommittees; (e) adoption of measures to ensure \nwomen's participation and effective contribution to the structures and processes set \nforth  in  the  PIM  Act,  as  provided  in  Section  D  (Gender  and  Development)  of \nAppendix 2; and (f) audit of accounts maintained by WUAs. \n(iv)  GOCG will ensure that the Amended PIM Act is drafted and validated through an \niterative, consultative process including all relevant stakeholders. \n(v)  Before the midterm review of the Project, in consonance with Government policies \non  rationalized  ISF  (water  tax),  GOCG  will  review  the  current  ISF  and  make \nappropriate adjustments based on the needs for O&M and cost sharing of the \nwater tax between WRD and WUAs. \n(vi)  For the R&U subprojects, GOCG will ensure (a) transfer of O&M to WUAs with \nadequate capacity, to be jointly reviewed by ADB, GOCG, WRD, and WUAs; (b) at \nleast one dedicated WUA responsible for one subproject; (c) transfer of O&M to \nWUAs under standard contracts specifying roles, responsibilities, maintenance of \n ", "18 \nproper accounts (for O&M and other funds received), and authority for irrigation \nmanagement and O&M; and (d) adequate funding for O&M through timely sharing \nwith WUAs of water tax collections, grants, or other measures. \n(vii)  GOCG will ensure that agreed staff in relevant units are in place before starting \nR&U works and subprojects; that R&U subprojects of minor irrigation systems will \nbe approved not later than 1 year and that of medium irrigation systems not later \nthan 2 years before project completion, respectively. \n(viii)  GOCG will follow the criteria for R&U subproject selection as indicated in Appendix \n5;  and  any  deviations  will  need  prior  approval  from  ADB.  Unless  otherwise \nrequired, the first five R&U subprojects in each of the CE zones will need prior \napproval of ADB. ADB may also conduct random audit of the subprojects. \n(ix)  GOCG will ensure that (a) the Project, particularly selection, design, construction, \nsupervision, implementation, and monitoring of the R&U works and subprojects is \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  on  involuntary  resettlement, \nindigenous peoples, and environment as detailed in the respective frameworks; \nand (b) all mitigation and monitoring measures under related IEE and EMP (with \nbudget) are incorporated and implemented in design (including detailed designs), \nconstruction, monitoring, and implementation of civil works under R&U schemes.  \n(x)  GOCG will ensure an extensive process for WUA and community participation to \npromote acceptance of the Project; subproject selection, design, construction, and \noperational monitoring; and also adequate public and stakeholder information and \nconsultation in complying with the safeguard policies of ADB. \n(xi)  WRD  through  the  bid  documents  and  civil  works  contracts  will  ensure  that \ncontractors (a) comply with all applicable labor laws and follow legally mandated \nprovisions on health, sanitation, and appropriate working conditions under the \nlaws; (b) do not employ child labor; (c) provide equal opportunities for women; \n(d) provide equal pay for equal work for men and women labor; and (e) ensure \nmonitoring of compliance with these provisions and provide for termination of any \ncontract in case of noncompliance. \n(xii)  GOCG will implement measures to maximize impacts on women under the Project \n(para. 36 and Section D\u2013Gender and Development\u2013 of Appendix 2).  \n(xiii)  GOCG will review existing WRD planning and development practice so that new \nirrigation investment targeted at tank schemes with a potential of 1,000 ha and \nabove will have the capability for at least 40% cropping intensity in rabi season \nbased on 75% dependable rainfall. The review and recommended guidelines will \nbe accomplished by year 5 of the Project. \n(xiv)  GOCG will have prepared a complete inventory of all minor irrigation schemes \nusing the Pre-planning: Rapid Assessment Data Sheet for Completed Minor and \nMedium Schemes provided by ADB to GOCG by December 2006. \nB.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Chhattisgarh, India: \n \nWater  resources  and  irrigated  agriculture  contribute  importantly  to  poverty  reduction  in  India  and \nChhattisgarh,  and  the  Project  will  strengthen  these  contributions.  In  Chhattisgarh,  the  majority  of  the \npopulation is poor, with the highest concentration of poverty in rural areas where 80% of the residents of \nChhattisgarh  live  and  are  employed  mainly  in  agricultural  activities.  An  estimated  43%  of  the  state\u2019s \npopulation live below the poverty line, and a similar proportion of the rural population lack access to \nelectricity, clean water, or sanitation. Landless and marginal farmers and farm laborers make up over 80% of \nthe rural poor. Of the state's population, 45% are members of scheduled tribes and scheduled castes, with an \nestimated 57% of them living below the poverty line. Many farmers in Chhattisgarh have small and marginal \nlandholdings. Medium-size farms (2-4 hectares [ha]) and large (>4 ha) farms account for over 70% of \nagricultural land in Chhattisgarh, but are owned by only 28% of farm families, while 72% have landholdings of \nless than 2 ha. Irrigated agriculture provides an important means to raise incomes and living standards for \nmany farmers, especially the poor and marginal ones with smallholdings. Yields from irrigated lands are \nhigher than those from rain-fed areas, and irrigation often provides the opportunity for a second crop, which \ngives large benefits over rain-fed farming. In the case of Chhattisgarh, irrigated agriculture also provides \ntremendous benefits for landless laborers employed in agricultural production. Importantly, a second crop \nreduces the pressure for seasonal migration of families due to under employment during the rabi season. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted Intervention\nThe usual activity status of people in the project area shows that just over 46% of the total population come \nunder the category of workers. Among the workers over 80% are either cultivators or agriculture laborers. \nIrrigation increases and stabilizes the production of rabi crops, ensuring food and income for marginal \nfarmers, small farmers, sharecroppers, and agriculture labor. Small and marginal holdings account for over \n72% of the total operational landholding in the state, and the average landholding of marginal and small \nfarmers is 0.40 ha and 1.30 ha, respectively. In the absence of reliable irrigation facilities, agriculture depends \nentirely on the monsoon rains and, nearly 94% of the farmers practice subsistence agriculture and opt for \nmonocropping, raising paddy for consumption. There is negligible marketable surplus of agricultural produce \nto enable them to buy any other goods. Use of fertilizer is low in the state (65 kilograms [kg] per acre), \ncompared with other parts of the country (140\u2013160 kg per acre). Average per capita annual income at current \nprices in the project area is Rs12,052 per year ($273.9 per year). Income distribution is highly skewed and is \ncorrelated to landownership pattern and access to resources. The top 5% have an income share of 70% and \nthe bottom 95% have an income share of only 30%. The initial survey carried out in four core subprojects \nrevealed that three fifths of households earn less than Rs6,000 per year and 37% earn between Rs6,000 and \nRs18,000 per year. Among cultivators, over 40% borrow money from moneylenders and around 45% obtain \ncredit from government agencies for agriculture operations. The poor depend on wage labor for survival; \nhowever, labor opportunities are limited due to single cropping. Many migrate to nearby cities or work, 40% in \nsome communities. Seasonal out-migration to nearby towns and big cities in search of jobs is part of the \nsurvival strategy of the poor. \n \nConsumption patterns show that nearly 45% of the total expenditure is on food, around 33% on water \ncharges, and a little over 21% on agriculture inputs. Expenses on education and health are less than 1%. \nMost households (90%) live in temporary houses (mud walls and thatched/tiled roof). Over half of the \npopulation is illiterate, and caloric intake is inadequate. Their diet lacks protein, necessary minerals, and \nvitamins, contributing to incidence of numerous diseases particularly among infants, children, and women. \nThe non-availability of safe drinking water is a perennial source of waterborne diseases such as cholera, \ndiarrhea, and jaundice. The tropical climate and prevalent unhygienic conditions breed mosquitoes that cause \nmalaria. Villagers have limited access or means to visit qualified medical practitioners. \n \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nC.  Participation Process \n \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nStakeholders Analysis:  To help identify four core subprojects, focus group discussions were held in \nfour core subproject areas with villagers including women and other vulnerable people. In-depth interviews \nwere held with officials at village, block, district and state levels. The triangulation method was used to cross-\ncheck information collected from the community.   \n    \nProject  Participation  Strategy: Participation  is  key  to  successful  implementation  of  any  development \nscheme, particularly when changes in knowledge, attitude, and practices are involved. The participation \nstrategy involves systematically deciding who will be engaged, in what manner and at what time. The primary \npurpose is to promote transparency, success, and sustainability, and prevent delays and manage conflicts. \nThe activities supported under the loan will focus on empowering water users associations (WUAs) in \ngovernance of irrigation systems. Irrigation field staff and contracted nongovernment organization/training \ninstitutions will assist in establishing and strengthening WUA. WUAs will prepare cropping plans, enter into \nirrigation management agreements with the Water Resource Department, take over governance of the \nscheme, and undertake operation and maintenance and improvement activities on a cost-sharing basis.  \n \n \nD.            Gender and Development \n  \nStrategy to Maximize Impacts on Women \nThe Project includes measures to ensure that beneficial impacts on women are maximized. Under the revised \nparticipatory irrigation management policies, the following institutional changes will be made: (i) membership \nto the WUA will be on a household basis so that both men and women will be members and have the right to \nattend meetings and cast votes; and (ii) all women who are part of a household that is a WUA member will be \nable to stand for election (not just women who are property owners with a title) and hold office on the WUA \nmanagement committee and any subcommittee. The WUA subcommittee structure will also ensure that \nwomen will be represented in WUA activities. The management committee will be required to have at least \ntwo women officers who either are elected under the general election or are nominated by the gender \nsubcommittee. Each WUA will have a gender subcommittee that will have the following mandate: (i) address \nthe needs of women title holders and WUA members, and women farm laborers in the irrigation system; (ii) \ndevelop and protect the use of and access to irrigation water for alternative purposes such as home gardens, \nlivestock, washing, and other domestic uses; and (iii) create capacity development and livelihood programs \nespecially targeting women. In addition to the gender subcommittee, women will have at least 33% target \nrepresentation on the other subcommittees that will be formed in every WUAs, including (i) the water \nallocation and distribution committee, (ii) the dispute resolution committee, and (iii) and the financial audit \ncommittee. Women subcommittee members will be encouraged to attend the training offered through the \nparticipatory irrigation management unit for WUA and 33% of the training slots will be initially reserved for \nwomen. For general training offered to all WUA members, 50% of the slots will initially be reserved for women \nWUA members. Women heads of households will receive priority in services provided to farmers through the \nProject. The WUA gender activities and (sub) committees will build from the base of members in the \nGovernment of India's Ministry of Rural Development program \u2013 Development of Women and Child in Rural \nAreas \u2013 that has existing committees in villages throughout India. In all activities supported through project \nfunds, it will be stipulated that women will receive equal pay for equal work and will be part of contractual \nobligations. The Project will require that PIM Unit staff have at least 20% women contracted through project \nfunds by year 3 of the project and 10% initially. The PIM unit staff will have at least 10% women trainers \n(consultants and nongovernment organizations) in the first year to increase to 20% no later than year 3 of the \nProject. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Water Resources Department and Irrigation in Chhattisgarh \n1.  Introduction. Chhattisgarh separated from Madhya Pradesh (MP) on 25 August 2000 \nwith the passage of the MP Reorganization Act of 2000. Chhattisgarh is the ninth largest state, \nbut ranks 17th in population with just over 21 million inhabitants. Chhattisgarh is rich in natural \nresources and retains 44% of forest cover, which supports livelihood activities, especially for \ntribal residents. The agriculture sector contributes about a third of Chhattisgarh's economic \noutput, but has been declining in recent years. Underperformance in the irrigated agriculture \nsector relates to the high concentration of poverty in rural areas where 80% of Chhattisgarh's \nresidents live and are employed in agricultural activities. \n2.  Overview of WRD. The Water Resources Department (WRD) of the Government of \nChhattisgarh (GOCG) was created by the MP Irrigation Act of 1931. According to its mandate, \nWRD  is  responsible  for  planning,  development,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of \nirrigation schemes; collection of water tariffs; monitoring groundwater; allocating water for bulk \nuse; and surface water regulation. WRD has a staff about 750 college-trained engineers and a \ntotal staff of 3,500 as well as numerous contractual employees. The jurisdiction of WRD is under \nfour chief engineers: one for the Mahanadi Reservoir Project, and three others that oversee \nnumerous projects in their respective zones. Below this level, WRD is divided into divisional \noffices headed by an executive engineer with about 60 divisional offices throughout the state. \nWRD develops and manages major (greater than 10,000 ha), medium (2,000\u201310,000 ha), and \nminor (40\u20132,000 ha) irrigation schemes. Currently, about 1.3 million ha of irrigated lands exist, \nwith  0.8  million  ha  in  completed  systems  and  0.5  million  ha  in  systems  with  ongoing \ndevelopment (Table A3). Once the ongoing schemes are fully completed, an additional 0.3 \nmillion ha will be added to the existing irrigated area. WRD estimates that almost 3 million \nadditional  ha  could  be  developed  for  a  total  of  4.3  million  ha.  Currently,  Chhattisgarh's \ndeveloped irrigation potential about half of India's national average.1 \n3.  When MP bifurcated giving rise to Chhattisgarh, Chhattisgarh did not receive the same \nquantity  or  quality  of  resources  that  remained  in  MP.  WRD  contracts  out  many  technical \nfunctions and designs for most civil works larger than those for minor schemes, and improved \ntechnical expertise for design and execution of minor schemes would be beneficial. However, \nWRD does have a cadre of experienced engineers that have managed many projects, and \nWRD will be adding over 360,000 ha of new irrigated area during the current 5-year plan. Like \nmany irrigation departments, WRD is construction-oriented, and economic analysis and system \nmanagement, operations, and especially maintenance activities may not be addressed to the \ndegree  necessary  to  maximize  and  sustain  irrigation  benefits.  WRD  would  benefit  from \nupgrading of administrative procedures, improved data management systems, and enhanced \nuse of information technology. WRD has established procedures for tendering, contracting, and \nexecuting civil works, and systems are in place for developing and administering over 1 million \nha of irrigated area. WRD executes projects using different Government funding sources and \nhas accounting measures in place to track different funds. WRD must also comply with rules for \nland acquisition and resettlement using GOCG procedures and must obtain project clearance \nfrom the Forestry Department.2 \n \n                                                 \n1  Chhattisgarh has an estimated 60,000 tubewells that irrigate nearly 200,000 ha. Chhattisgarh is estimated to have \na total of 11,960 million cubic meters of groundwater available for development, which provides substantial \nadditional irrigation potential. Farmers have installed well over 90% of the tubewells using private funds. \n2  An in-depth institutional analysis took place during project preparation.

While WRD's basic capacities for irrigation management and development exist, their \neffectiveness  and  the  resulting  development  impact  of  irrigation  could  be  improved  with \nupgrading  of  procedures  and  modernization  of  skills.  Technical  capacity,  especially  for \ndevelopment of minor schemes, could be improved. Many of the current design criteria and \noperational  procedures  date  from  the  British  period.  The  development  of  proficiency  for \neconomic  analysis,  social  assessment  and  vulnerable  persons  issues,  environmental \nassessment, and creation of effective water users associations (WUAs) would result in more \neffective irrigation development in line with current international best practice. The greatest \nsector issue, however, is inadequate attention and resources for system O&M, and systemic \ninstitutional changes are required to address this problem. \n5.  Current Status of Irrigation Development. Increasing the productivity of agriculture is \nvital to the overall development of Chhattisgarh's economy, improvement in rural livelihood, and \npoverty reduction. Expansion of irrigation is a primary strategy of GOCG to increase agricultural \nproductivity. GOCG's 5-Year Plan (FYP) has allocated approximately $500 million to water \nresources and irrigation development from 2002 to 2007. The amount represents over 20% of \nGOCG\u2019s development expenditures for a planned expansion of 360,000 ha during the current \nFYP. The FYP contains WRD's development policy that includes the following objectives: (i) create \na master plan for water resources, (ii) improve packages for resettlement and land acquisition, \n(iii) evaluate and provide safety measures for dams and canals, (iv) ensure active farmer \nparticipation in the management of irrigation systems, (v) rationalize water rates, (vi) develop \nand manage groundwater, (vii) develop and conserve water resources in drought\u2013prone areas \nand, (viii) provide regular training for WRD staff. WRD, however, would benefit from enhanced \nresources and skills, and assistance in formulating action plans and developing capacity to \nimplement much of the irrigation development policy. \n6.  Notwithstanding  GOCG's  investment,  irrigation  systems  perform  poorly.  Improved \nirrigation development, management, and O&M are essential to support rabi (dry season) and \ndiversified cropping. The current cropping intensity in Chhattisgarh is about 120% compared \nwith  Punjab's  183%.  Existing  irrigation  systems  in  Chhattisgarh  perform  much  below  their \npotential. Utilization3 is less than 50% for minor schemes, 50 to 60% for medium schemes, and \nabout 75% for major schemes.4 Two thirds of minor schemes have a utilization ratio of less than \n50%, one third have less than 30%, and some minor schemes irrigate less than 10% of the \ndesign area.  \n7.  This low performance is largely a result of inadequate water management, insufficient \nO&M,  associated  system  deterioration  due  to  inadequate  funds,  and,  ultimately,  lack  of \n                                                 \n3  Utilization is the ratio of area of the irrigation system receiving irrigation water relative to the potential of the \ndesigned command area. \n4  Data is uncertain. Figures are based on analysis of over 800 schemes during project preparation. \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nownership  and  participation  by  farmers.  Over  80%  of  WRD's  operating  costs  go  toward \nestablishment with little funds actually going to the for O&M activities or to the WUAs.5 GOCG's \ncollection of the irrigation service fee (ISF) averages 20\u201325% in most years and is inadequate \nfor O&M. Many farmers do not pay the ISF because they do not see satisfactory delivery of \nirrigation water and there is no evidence that the ISF results in improved O&M or service \ndelivery. WRD does not have the staff or resources to develop and implement O&M guidelines \nin  many  systems  or  to  inspect,  prioritize,  and  execute  maintenance  activities.  In  addition, \nfarmers, especially head reach farmers, often make unauthorized turnouts in irrigation systems \nand take water beyond their allocation. Tail end farmers have little recourse to address the \nsituation, and WRD is often ineffective or unengaged in redressing these problems. \nB.  Agriculture \n8.  Overview  of  Agriculture  in  Chhattisgarh.  Chhattisgarh  has  three  distinct  agro-\necological zones with differing annual rainfall: the northern hill zone (2.85 million ha; 1,250\u2013\n1,725 millimeters [mm] of rainfall); the central Chhattisgarh plains zone (7.49 million ha; 1,300\u2013\n1,600 mm); and the southern Bastar plateau zone (3.26 million ha; 1,200\u20131,600 mm). Ninety \npercent of Chhattisgarh's annual rainfall occurs in the roughly 90 day monsoon period (the wet \ngrowing  season)  from  mid-June  through  October.  Chhattisgarh's  rice  production  varies \nsignificantly with rainfall and has recently varied between 2.9 and 5.9 million ton (t). Paddy \nproduction accounts for about 75% of annual cropping, or about 4.0 million out of 4.8 million ha \nof the net sown area with only 23% of the area irrigated. The average rice yield in the state is \nlower than India's national, average with little more than 1 ton per ha (t/ha) for rain-fed rice. \nIrrigated rice averages about 2.5 t/ha (2\u20134 t/ha), depending on inputs and varieties. India's \nnational average is closer to 4.0 t. Apart from paddy in kharif season, farmers grow about 0.5 \nmillion ha of pulses, over 0.2 million ha of oilseed crops, as well as maize, millet, vegetables, \nand other crops that also have lower yields than national averages. Little irrigated agriculture \ntakes place during rabi season. \n9.  Policies. As part of its Vision 20126 strategic plan formulated in 2002, Chhattisgarh has \nset the following goals for improved productivity of agriculture and allied sectors: (i) increase the \ncontribution of agriculture to the state economy by over 50% during the next 10 years; (ii) reorient \nthe  current  cropping  pattern  in  Chhattisgarh;  (iii)  move  from  single  cropping  to  multiple \ndiversified cropping with focus on cash crops;7 (iv) increase yields in line with the proposed \nincrease in cropping intensity (200% target); and (v) put greater emphasis on development of \nallied sectors. Developing and implementing an action plan to achieve these objectives will \nrequire support since capacity in the agriculture sector needs strengthening. Increasing the \nproductivity  of  irrigated  agriculture  is  necessary  to  achieve  these  productivity  goals  of  the \nagriculture sector as a whole. \n10.  Chhattisgarh  has  the  ability  to  address  some  agricultural  policies  regarding  agency \nreforms and public investment, but the Government of India controls many pricing, subsidy, and \nother policies that influence agriculture. India has made some progress in removing restrictions \non private sector investment in handling commodities and more open interstate trade. The \nGovernment, through the Food Corporation of India, procures rice and wheat along side the \nprivate market with a minimum support price (MSP) to (i) assure farmers of reasonable income, \nand (ii) to sell it at a subsidized price through the Targeted Public Distribution System to ensure \nfood security for the poor. In 2000, the MSP was 40\u201350% higher than production costs in some \n                                                 \n5  In one district it was reported that no funds were available for any O&M over a 5-year period during the 1990s. \n6  Vision 2012 is a planning document prepared with consultant assistance by the GOCG administration in 2002. \n7  India's agriculture sector diversified significantly during the 1990s, led mainly by the western and southern states. \nThose states with the greatest diversification also saw the highest agricultural growth rates. ", "  Appendix 3  29 \nstates. The MSP has led to large national buffer stocks and distortions in cropping practice, but \nthe distribution of the subsidy and its impacts have not been uniform. It has tended to benefit \nlarger  farmers  in  some  select  states  with  intensive  agriculture  that  continue  to  lobby  for \nincreased MSP. Poorer states including MP have not benefited significantly, with limited MSP \nsupport found there. In Chhattisgarh, farmers have noted little permanent difference between \nprivate and state market prices, which are close to the world price. India has indicated its \nintention to rationalize fertilizer prices at the beginning of the decade with complete decontrol of \nurea by 2006. Overall, these national policies do not have substantial distortionary impacts on \nagriculture in Chhattisgarh relative to the rest of India. \n11.  The Farm System. Agricultural practices need strengthening, especially for diversified \nand rabi cropping. Many farmers are inexperienced in growing anything but kharif rice. Long-\nmaturing rice varieties are often used. They are planted late and require watering well beyond \nthe end of the monsoon, taking water that could be available for rabi crops if more timely \nplanting and shorter-maturing varieties were used. Livestock often eat rabi crops, which can be \nremedied in a variety of ways with cooperation and orientation of farm communities to rabi \ncropping. The Department of Agriculture (DA) extension service does not have the capacity to \neffectively address these shortcomings. The DA has many unfilled positions, existing staff may \nnot have an agricultural background or training, and extension staff lack resources such as \ntransportation to deliver services effectively. \n12.  Government-sponsored rural cooperative societies and the private sector provide inputs \nfor farmers, and the cooperative societies provide agrochemicals at subsidized prices. During \nproject preparation, 94.5% of the households surveyed were using fertilizers, but at about half \nthe rate in other parts of the country. Different fertilizers are subsidized at different rates; this \nsituation creates distortion in their purchase, with subsequent misapplication. These problems \ncombined with untimely availability of fertilizer at cooperative societies, imprecise field-to-field \nirrigation,  and  ignorance  concerning  proper  application  limit  the  effectiveness  of  fertilizers. \nSeeds are also available through cooperative societies and the private sector, but quality and \nvarieties vary and may not always yield the best results. Cooperative societies are located in \neach  block  (lowest  state  municipal  level)  in  Chhattisgarh  and  private  vendors  are  found \nthroughout the state, so that almost all farmers have access to inputs within 5\u201310 kilometers of \ntheir  farm.  Credit  is  also  available  to  most  farmers  through  cooperative  societies.  The \nGovernment has periodically been lowering interest rates with the last time being in 2004. Of the \nfarmers surveyed during project preparation, 45% borrowed from government sources, 40% \nborrowed  from  private  moneylenders,  and  15%  used  their  own  resources.  Credit  is  not \nperceived to be a limiting constraint, but the largest constraint retarding the effective use of all \ninputs is an unreliable water supply that poses too great a risk for farmers to borrow and make \nthe  optimal  input  investment  and  application.  In  general,  inputs  are  available.  Improved \nknowledge with regard to input selection and application, linkages with quality suppliers and, \nmost importantly, a reliable water supply will address many of the existing problems of non-\noptimal input use. \n13.  Marketing. The rice, pulses, oilseeds, and other crops produced in Chhattisgarh are \neither consumed at home or sold in local markets. Chhattisgarh has 170 wholesale and 1,679 \nprimary rural markets throughout the state, and most farmers have access to a primary rural \nmarket within a day's travel by tractor, truck, or bullock cart. In the household survey during \nproject preparation, over 68% of the farmers kept much of their produce for home consumption, \nabout 25% sold in local markets, and 7% sold to local middlemen. In many communities, a \nportion of any increase in food production would be consumed by the farm household or locally \ndue to widespread food insecurity, limiting the marketable surplus. Due to the predominance of \npaddy, Chhattisgarh has a well-developed processing industry with over 700 rice mills with a \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \ncapacity of around 3 million t. Chhattisgarh has some oilseed facilities, and development of \nallied industries is an important goal that will receive assistance from the proposed Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Agribusiness Development Support Project.8 \n14.  Chhattisgarh used to produce over 70% of the rice, nearly half of all food grains, and one \nthird of all major crops grown during kharif in MP before bifurcation, yet Chhattisgarh produces \nonly about 4% of India's rice. Chhattisgarh produced 45% of the jowar and over 80% of the \ngram in undivided MP, and a quarter of all MP's pulses during rabi come from Chhattisgarh. MP \nrepresents an important and growing market for Chhattisgarh. Chhattisgarh's rice production \nand  other  major  crops  are  price  competitive  with  neighboring  states  and  crops  such  as \nsorghum, soybeans, and pulses offer price advantages for Chhattisgarh. Market opportunities \nare increasing as infrastructure improves rapidly and as Chhattisgarh and surrounding areas \nurbanize. In Chhattisgarh, production of maize, gram, and other pulses, oilseed, and vegetables \nhas been rising steadily in recent years, indicating that demand, farmer responsiveness, and \nmarkets exist for those crops. \n15.  Irrigation and Dry Season Cropping. Inadequate irrigation system design, on-farm \nirrigation  practices,  and  lack  of  water  management  limit  rabi  and  diversified  cropping \nopportunities. Farmers build large field bunds to trap monsoon rains, and supplemental irrigation \nwater is applied imprecisely to paddy that can thrive in standing water. Rabi and diversified \ncrops require more precise application of water (and drainage) than is currently possible in most \nirrigation systems both at the farm level and in larger canals. Current irrigation development by \nWRD does not include development of field channels or on-farm water management, and few \nsystems have extensive command area development or control structures. The Command Area \nDevelopment  Authority,  a  federally  funded  program,  supports  command  area  development \nactivities in medium and major irrigation schemes in Chhattisgarh, but covers less than 10% of \nthe service area. Flooded, field-to-field irrigation results in tremendous water wastage and \nmakes effective use of fertilizer and other inputs difficult. \n16.  Design and operation of the irrigation systems limit rabi cropping. Many minor and a few \nmedium irrigation systems are designed to provide only supplemental irrigation during the kharif \nseason, so that even with a good monsoon, inadequate storage prevents irrigation of rabi crops. \nEven in systems with larger storage capacity, sluice gates may be broken or reservoir releases \nhave no formal procedures and are oriented toward kharif paddy, with little water remaining for \nrabi. Measurement of water deliveries is rare, and irrigation delivery is not based on real time \ncrop  requirements.  Canals,  including  main  canals,  lack  cross  regulation  and  gated  control \nstructures to manage water deliveries. Outlet structures also lack adequate control structures or \noften do not exist. In some cases, WRD has failed to complete distributary and minor canal \nnetworks  after  completion  of  the  storage  and  main  canals.  These  problems  highlight  the \ninterconnectedness of water management and its impact on rabi and diversified cropping. \nC.  Water Users Associations \n17.  WUAs in Chhattisgarh. Chhattisgarh retained the Participatory Irrigation Management \n(PIM) Act that was passed in 1999 when it was part of MP. The PIM Act created a three-tiered \nsystem of WUAs with (i) basic WUAs at the field level, (ii) higher-level project committees for \nspecial works, and a (iii) distributary committee as an apex body in larger systems. When the \nPIM Act was adopted, 946 WUAs were created on over 1.1 million ha, but none of the higher-\nlevel committees had been formed. The functionality of existing WUAs varies but is generally \npoor. Each WUA has one president and 8-10 officials who are directly elected and who execute \nalmost all WUA activities. The president convenes and chairs WUA meetings and represents \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the Agribusiness Development Support Project. Manila. ", "  Appendix 3  31 \nthe WUA to WRD and at all local forums. Meetings are only for the elected WUAs leaders. \nVoting in the elections is limited to farmers who are current with their water tax accounts. These \nrequirements may limit voting members to 25% of the farmers in some instances. Elections for \nnew WUA officers are scheduled in June 2005, at which time elections for the project and \ndistributary committees are supposed to take place.  \n18.  WUAs' functions include the following: (i) coordinating water distribution among turnouts, \n(ii) patrolling canals to enforce the distribution schedule and to check for damage, (iii) informing \nthe irrigation subengineer of problems so that he can prepare a technical appraisal for WRD that \nwill enable the WUA to access funds to repair the damage, (iv) resolving conflicts among \nfarmers, and (v) calling meetings of members of the WUAs before kharif and rabi seasons to \ndetermine the water delivery schedule. WUA officers manage finances and are the signing \nauthorities of the WUA bank account into which WRD is supposed to deposit maintenance \nfunds. As noted, however, execution is typically weak. Farmers are very supportive of a greater \nrole in system management and O&M, but the WUAs currently do not facilitate their participation \neffectively due to lack of initial mobilization, capacity development, and ongoing support. \n19.  A  large  reason  for  lack  of  capacity  development  is  that  the  WUAs  were  formed \nimmediately before bifurcation, and WRD did not give adequate attention to WUAs' mobilization \nand development.9 WRD lacks resources and skills to effectively develop and empower WUAs. \nProviding  WRD  the  guidance  and  resources  for  an  effective  WUA  capacity  development \nprogram would have a tremendous impact on the activity and ability of WUAs for system \nmanagement and O&M, and overall improvement of irrigated agriculture in Chhattisgarh. \n20.  In addition to needed capacity development, the institutional framework for PIM could be \nstrengthened with the following modifications to provide a stronger enabling environment for \neffective  WUAs:  (i)  changing  the  election  cycle  so  that  not  all  officers  of  the  managing \ncommittee change at one time; (ii) developing bylaws that clearly define WUA functions; (iii) \nreorganizing committees and subcommittees for more effective execution of duties; (iv) defining \nroles and responsibilities of the members of the general body, managing committee, president, \nand WRD in the PIM Act; (v) developing memorandum of understanding/service agreement \nbetween the WUA and WRD that enumerates roles and responsibilities, services provided, and \nfees paid and received for greater accountability; (vi) removing WRD officials as ex officio WUA \nmembers to play an advisory role; (vii) expanding the membership of the general body to \ninclude households so women can vote and stand for office, and to include non-landowners who \ntill the soil and manage water; (viii) ensuring that irrigation systems above 200 ha will have at \nleast one dedicated WUA; and (ix) ensuring fund flows to WUAs for sustainable O&M ideally \nthrough direct sharing of the ISF between WRD and WUAs. Some policy changes can only be \nmade by revising the existing PIM Act, but many important policy changes such as sharing ISF \ncollections can be achieved within the existing legal framework. Amending the current PIM Act \nis the most effective option to achieve the desired policy objectives. \n21.  Experience with PIM in India. Since the 1990s, Gujarat, Haryana, MP, Maharashtra, \nOrissa, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh have had programs to form and strengthen WUAs for \nimproved irrigation. Andhra Pradesh (AP) had the largest and most intensive effort, which was \nassisted by the World Bank. Many states including MP in 1999, have used the Andhra Pradesh \nFarmers' Management of Irrigation System Act 1997 (AP Act) as the basis of their own PIM Act. \nIn 1994, only 48% of the command area in AP was being utilized. After the PIM program in 1997 \nthat  included  institutional  reforms,  rehabilitation,  and  O&M  funds,  the  gross  irrigated  area \ndoubled  in  some  command  areas,  using  two-thirds  the  amount  of  water  that  had  been \npreviously applied. In Rajasthan after the PIM reforms, the average rotation of watering time in \n                                                 \n9  MP has undertaken some WUA strengthening and PIM reform since bifurcation. \n ", "32  Appendix 3 \none canal command was reduced from 79 to 47 days, which significantly increased water \navailability in all reaches of the command area. In AP, the payment of the ISF increased \nsignificantly despite a large concurrent increase in the per-ha ISF rate due to improved service \nand a decline in underreporting occurred since WUAs would receive a portion of the fee. \n22.  In AP, the state government played a large role in promoting irrigation reforms and \ndemonstrated that the irrigation department has to be intimately involved in the reform process. \nOne of the successes of the AP case is that it explicitly set out to redefine the roles of the \nirrigation department and irrigation users, which were articulated in the AP Act. Passage of the \nAP Act was important for it established the WUAs as legal entities and defined their rights and \nobligations  vis-a-vis  the  irrigation  department.  Some  states  have  created  model  contracts \nbetween WUAs and the irrigation department that clearly specify the roles and responsibilities of \neach  and  provide  an  important  accountability  mechanism.  Clearly  demarcating  authority, \nresponsibilities, rules, and member behavior through development of bylaws for WUAs and their \nmembers  has  been  pursued  in  some  states.  The  state  is  critical  to  ensure  an  enabling \nframework to support effective WUAs. \n23.  WUA initiatives have addressed financial issues and improved resources for WUAs and \nO&M, and different mechanisms have been used to pursue those objectives. All states have \ngiven WUAs indirect support through assistance in elections, collection of fees by government \nstaff, and auditing of accounts. In AP, ISF trebled the year the reforms took place, with little \nopposition at the time since most of the funds went to the WUAs; however, raising ISF is \npolitically contentious. Some states that have complied with aid agency-mandated rate changes \nhave subsequently rebuffed them. Several states have introduced direct sharing of the ISF \ncollections with the WUA, which improves the incentive for farmer payment, is more certain than \ndistributing the money from WRD budgets to WUAs, and ensures that the money ends up for \nO&M.  An  important  right  given  to  WUAs  in  most  states  is  the ability  to  charge  members \nadditional fees and to receive revenue from diversified sources, which provides greater financial \nstability. In AP and other states, one-time grants to help with WUAs organizational costs have \nbeen given under aid-funded programs, and some short-term O&M funds have been provided \nuntil WUA's own revenue sources solidify. Enhanced financial resources must be a part of \nreforms for successful WUAs. \n24.  Mobilization and capacity development have been critical parts of developing WUAs in \nAP, Karnataka, and other states. Capacity development programs in India have involved all \nstakeholders from senior government officials to village dwellers, but primarily address WUA \nand irrigation department staff. For WUAs, capacity development has supported core activities \nsuch as water management, O&M, financial management, monitoring and conflict resolution, \nand, in some cases, agricultural extension. In AP, irrigation department staff were trained and \nsensitized to inform agency staff of technical details of the PIM program and to help change \nattitudes and mindsets in working with farmers as partners. The AP's program success came \nlargely from involving WUAs in all aspects of irrigation, including physical development (design \nand construction), O&M, and management (technical, financial, and administrative) and, to the \ndegree possible, putting the irrigation department in a supporting advisory role.

Background \n1.  The Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance (TA) from the Government of the United \nKingdom has been very supportive of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) program in India. The \nCooperation Fund provided grant assistance to help prepare the Project and has been involved \nduring the Project's development. The Project embodies the overall goals of the Cooperation \nFund by ensuring sustainably improved livelihoods for the rural poor. ADB and the Cooperation \nFund agreed that capacity development and institutional strengthening activities for water users \nassociation (WUAs) would be supported through a TA to enhance the development impact of \nthe ADB Project. \nB.  Purpose and Output \n2.  The purpose of the TA is to help develop (i) an enabling framework and capacity for \neffective WUAs that will be able to assume responsibility for irrigation system management and \noperation and maintenance (O&M), and (ii) farmer capacity for diversified and rabi (dry season) \ncropping.  An  additional  goal  is  to  integrate  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E)  into  project \nactivities with broad stakeholder involvement. The TA will result in the following: (i) creation \nof a WUA Capacity Development Program that will provide core training for WUAs throughout \nChhattisgarh; (ii) a training of trainers program to develop the skills of project contracted staff and \nWater Resource Department (WRD) staff who will train to WUAs in the field; (iii) development \nand refinement of the process for WUA participatory rehabilitation and upgrading of irrigation \nsystems under the ADB project including needs assessment, design, construction supervision; \n(iv)  support  to  develop  a  comprehensive  institutional  framework  for  participatory  irrigation \nmanagement (PIM) and WUAs in Chhattisgarh, including a revised PIM Act, a standardized \ncontract outlining management responsibilities for WRD and WUAs, and development of bylaws \nthat specify responsibilities of WUAs and their members; (v) a capacity development program to \nassist WUAs and farmers with improved farm practices for rabi and diversified cropping; and (vi) \ndevelopment  of  an  M&E  program  that  addresses  livelihood  impacts  and  includes  WUA \nparticipation. Specifically, the TA will support WUA and agricultural specialists recruited for the \nProject. \nC.  Expected Results and Outputs \n3.  The  proposed  TA  will  produce  the  following:  (i)  development  of  training  materials, \nmodules, and other capacity developing materials that will support the establishment of an \nongoing WUA training program; (ii) qualified professionals within the WRD PIM Unit who are \nable to effectively train WUA members in the skills needed for management and O&M of \nirrigation  systems,  as  well  as  in  techniques  to  support  rabi  and  diversified  cropping;  (iii) \ninstitutionalization of PIM and WUA capacity development as part of ongoing activities for WRD; \n(iv) functional WUAs that are able to manage and execute O&M for irrigation systems; (v) \nfarmers who are able to grow rabi and diversified crops; and (vi) an M&E program. \nD.  Cost Estimates and Financing Arrangements \n4.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2.375 million equivalent, comprising $1.313 \nmillion in foreign exchange and $1.062 million in local currency. The Government has requested \nthat ADB finance an amount of $1.9 million of the TA cost, comprising the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $587,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government of the \nUnited Kingdom will provide this amount on a grant basis to be administered by ADB.

Implementation Arrangements \n5.  WRD will be the Executing Agency. TA consultants will work in the WRD PIM Unit and \nthe project management unit. The project director will serve as the TA director, and the Project's \nsteering and technical coordinating committees will provide guidance for the TA as they do for \nthe Project. WRD has agreed to provide counterpart staff to work with the TA consultants; office \naccommodations; data collection and management; and studies, surveys, and field support. \nSupport to the TA consultant for vehicles, equipment, development and delivery of training \nmaterials, and other required materials will be provided under project funds. The TA consultants \nwill  have  direct  responsibility  to  manage  staff  (including  nongovernment  organizations) \ncontracted with project funds that will provide initial support to the PIM Unit. \n6.  The TA will be implemented over 7 years concomitant with the project duration. The \nmajority of the input will take place during the first 3 years of the Project, with incremental \ninternational inputs taking place in the later years of the contract. A team of consultants will \nprovide 59 international and 164 domestic person-months of consulting services in WUA and \nPIM  development,  water  management,  agricultural  support  development,  and  M&E \n(Supplementary  Appendix  C,  Consultant  Package  B  of  the  Project  contains  the  terms  of \nreference). ADB will engage a consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. \nThe consulting firm will be selected using a simplified technical proposal and quality- and cost- \nbased  selection  procedures.  Advance  action  will  be  taken  to  recruit  the  consultants  on  a \nnoncommittal basis. ", "  Appendix 12  43 \nSUMMARY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of minor and medium irrigation schemes under \nthe Project will benefit a command area of about 200,000 hectares (ha) and directly affect \n120,000 families or 600,000 beneficiaries. Emergency repairs on sluice gates will result in \ncontrolled water supply in storage reservoirs. In addition, the institutionalization of participatory \nirrigation management (PIM) and improved functioning of water users associations (WUAs) will \nimprove the performance of irrigation throughout Chhattisgarh, which has a total command area \nof over 1.4 million ha. As a result of the Project, irrigation infrastructure will be operated, \nmaintained,  and  managed  in  a  more  sustainable  way  by  WUAs  to  whom  management \nresponsibility for most activities will be transferred. WUAs will also contribute to operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) in cash, labor, and materials. Improved irrigation infrastructure and service \ndelivery  will  improve  supplementary  irrigation  for  the  kharif  season  (wet  season).  Better \nmanagement of water resources will allow expansion of irrigated cropping in rabi (dry season) \nresulting in increased agricultural output, permitting diversification into higher value crops and \nraising household incomes, generating employment, and reducing poverty. \nB.  Methodology and Main Assumptions \n2.  Economic and financial analyses were prepared for the four pilot subprojects (two minor \nand two medium schemes) to assess economic viability, the impact on beneficiary households, \nand their ability to contribute to O&M needs. Economic analysis of the overall Project is also \npresented. Project financial costs were estimated in Indian rupees (Rs) using prices prevailing in \nthe first half of 2004, expressed in constant prices over the project implementation period of 7 \nyears. Financial prices were derived from local sources and include taxes and duties. Economic \nprices were derived based on the following criteria: (i) a domestic price numeraire; (ii) values \nexpressed in constant 2004 prices to exclude inflation; (iii) the Indian rupee being the unit of \naccount; (iv) a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 for nontraded goods and services and a \nshadow value of 0.75 for unskilled and agricultural labor to take account of the surplus of labor \nin the rural areas; (v) border parity pricing with standard methods to derive farmgate input/output \nprices for major tradable commodities; and (vi) transfer payments such as taxes and subsidies \nbeing excluded in calculating economic values. \n3.  Agricultural  Inputs  and  Outputs.  The  main  agricultural  inputs  are  labor,  seeds, \nfertilizer, agrochemicals, and animal and mechanical cultivation. India manufactures its own \nnitrogenous and phosphate fertilizer and imports needed potassium fertilizer. The economic \ncost of fertilizer is based on export parity prices for urea and phosphate, and import parity prices \nfor potassium. Agrochemical prices are based on current market rates. Agricultural labor rates \nare around Rs55 and Rs40 per day for men and women, respectively. The economic prices of \nthe main tradable agricultural outputs (rice, wheat, and maize) are based on their border parity \nequivalent farmgate prices. India currently has surplus production of these food grains and small \nquantities are exported to neighboring countries, so that marginal production will add to exports. \nIndia currently imports a significant portion of pulses and oilseeds for its consumption needs and \nincreased  production  is  valued  as  an  import  substitute  with  a  higher  farmgate  price.  For \ncommodities not traded internationally, the local financial price is used as the economic price. \n4.  Subprojects. For the four pilot subprojects (Balar, Banki, Darki, and Pakhanjore), R&U \ncosts,  crop  budgets,  cropping  patterns,  and  technologies  were  detailed  based  on  field \nengineering estimates, water availability from the scheme's catchment area, reservoir capacity \nand expected changes in land use due to improved water and irrigation management, and \n ", "44  Appendix 12 \nincreased availability of water for rabi cropping. Scenarios with and without the Project were \nevaluated. The farmers\u2019 preference during kharif is primarily to grow rice for home consumption \nand income generation. During rabi, a combination of wheat, pulses, and oilseeds is cultivated \ndepending on local conditions, markets, and relative profitability. The R&U engineering and \nconstruction costs for each subproject were estimated based on the design of the proposed \nstructures and rehabilitation works, including field channels. All direct and indirect R&U costs \n(economic), including labor, equipment, materials, services, and overhead for the four pilot \nschemes, vary from $116 to $543 per ha, depending on system degradation and required \nworks. For the overall Project, an average R&U cost of $216 per ha was estimated. It comprises \n$145 for canal rehabilitation, $31 for repairs of dams and bunds, and $40 per ha for field \nchannels. Based on these costs and project funds for R&U, the Project should be able to \nrehabilitate about 200,000 ha. \n5.  O&M. The Water Resources Department (WRD) estimated the cost of administration \nand O&M at Rs500 ($11.10) per ha per year. WRD assesses farmers an irrigation service fee \n(ISF), (water tax in local usage) of Rs200 per ha for paddy in kharif and Rs99\u2013Rs741 per ha in \nrabi, depending on the crop and expected waterings. During policy dialogue, the Government of \nChhattisgarh (GOCG) agreed that the ISF will be shared with WUAs (for O&M) following its \ncollection, or other resources would be provided for O&M. The farmers will contribute to the \nWUA and O&M through the ISF, their labor and materials for O&M, and additional funds or \nspecial collections. \n6.  Project  Life  and  Sensitivity  Analysis.  The  expected  scheme  life  is  20  years. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out to test the impact of changes and main risks: deterioration of \ninfrastructure due to poor O&M resulting in lower irrigation utilization, increased construction \ncosts, decreased benefits, and a change in the price of rice. The impact of the Project on \nhousehold incomes and returns to labor was assessed to judge the capacity to pay for O&M and \npotential impact on poverty reduction. Information for the Banki scheme, one of the four pilot \nsubprojects, is in paras. 7-13.

Banki Medium Scheme Subproject Analysis \n7.  The Banki scheme has a command area of 2,000 ha. It is located in the northern zone of \nChhattisgarh and is typical of a self-contained design for rabi cropping: it has a sufficient \ncatchment area and reservoir capacity to provide supplementary irrigation to all the command \narea during the monsoon kharif and full irrigation for 63% of the command area in rabi (based \non 65% rainfall and runoff exceedance probability). \n8.  Subproject  Costs.  The  total  financial  investment  cost  is  estimated  at  $549,000 \nincluding 6% for design and supervision. Rehabilitation of the irrigation canal system makes up \n78% of the costs; construction of field canals and watercourses, 19%; and repairs to the dam, \n3%. For the subproject analysis, an additional $15,000 is budgeted to strengthen WUAs to carry \nout O&M and for farmer training and agricultural support services. Total project costs are ", "  Appendix 12  45 \nestimated at around $280 per ha (Rs12,600). Annual O&M costs are estimated at Rs500 per ha \nper year (para. 5). For the economic analysis, the financial costs were converted to economic \nequivalent values to account for distortions (taxes, etc.) and for the opportunity cost of labor. \n9.  Subproject Benefits. Benefits arise from the increase in rice production during kharif \ndue  to  supplementary  irrigation.  The  expansion  of  rabi  cropping,  which  depends  fully  on \nirrigation,  also  provides  substantial  benefits.  Incremental  crop  production  revenue  net  of \nadditional production costs is the main benefit. The without-Project scenario assumes that only \n19% of the command area receives supplemental irrigation in kharif, the majority is entirely rain-\nfed, and 16% of the area is irrigated in rabi. The kharif season is devoted entirely to rice \nproduction and presently yields an average 2.7 tons per ha (t/ha) for irrigated rice and 1.7 t/ha \nfor rain-fed rice. The main crops grown during rabi season are irrigated wheat with an average \nyield of 2.2 t/ha and pulse crops, which yield 0.5 t/ha. In the with-Project situation, it is assumed \nthat 100% of the command area would receive supplementary irrigation during kharif and that \naverage yields for rice would increase to 3.7 t/ha, while in rabi season an area of 1,250 ha (63% \nof the command area) would be irrigated and utilized for wheat (48%) yielding 3.0 t/ha, pulses \n(28%) with 1.0 t/ha, and oilseeds (24%) with 0.8 t/ha.  \n10.  Rehabilitating the Banki scheme is expected to increase paddy rice production by 3,749 \nt and diversified crops (wheat, pulses, and oilseeds) by 1,964 t, a 100% overall increase in \nproduction. The incremental on-farm employment generated by the additional labor requirement \nfor crop production is 130,000 person-days, an 83% increase. Financial net agricultural revenue \nwill increase by Rs17.3 million ($0.385 million), which equates to an average annual income of \nRs8,673 per ha ($192.73), a 121% increase. For the average-size farm of 1.7 ha in the scheme, \nthe average farm income will increase by Rs14,911 per year ($331.35), which is adequate to \nmeet O&M costs to maintain the irrigation network. \n11.  Farmer Financial Incentives. The Banki scheme has an estimated 1,163 households \ndistributed into these socioeconomic groups and farm size: 69 landless households (5.6%); 464 \nmarginal farmers, 0.5 ha (39.3%); 383 small farmers, 1.5 ha (31.1%); and 296 medium and \nlarge farmers, 4 ha (24%). When the scheme is fully operational the average 1.7 ha farm will \nhave an incremental production of 3.0 t rice per year, 1.35 t wheat, and 0.35 t pulses and \noilseeds. Crop production will fully satisfy the annual nutritional needs of the average family and \nallow a considerable surplus for sale. Farm income is expected to increase by an average of \nRs14,900 ($335) per year, a 121% increase from the present situation.   \n12.  Capacity and Willingness to Pay for O&M. Annual O&M costs for the schemes are \nestimated at Rs500 per ha per year ($11.11).1 For the average size of holding this is Rs860 per \nyear ($18.90). The incremental benefits from the increased crop production cover this amount \nmany  times  over  and  the  beneficiaries  have  adequate  capacity  and  incentive  to  ensure \nsustainable  operation  by  contributing  to  O&M  costs.  Their  willingness  to  pay  will  be \nstrengthened by the assistance given under the Project to WUAs through facilities provided, \ncapacity building and training, and support for PIM and agricultural services. As several years \nwill  be  needed  for  average  farming  practices  to  fully  reflect  the  opportunities  provided  by \nimproved irrigation, there is justification for the Project to provide initial training and financial \nsupport to the WUAs as an incentive for their establishment, and for O&M start-up costs and \nequipment. \n13.  Economic Return and Sensitivity . The economic net present value of the net benefit \nstream is Rs43.6 million ($0.97 million) at a discount rate of 12%. The economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 33.4% and the benefit-cost ratio is 2.9:1. Sensitivity analysis was conducted \n                                                 \n1 This was used as a very conservative estimate for the financial analysis. WRD estimates O&M costs at about \nRs180 per ha for minor schemes and Rs252 per ha for medium schemes.  \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \nwith the following results. A 20% increase in the investment costs will cause the EIRR to fall to \n28.6%.  The  switching  value  occurs  at  a  268%  increase  in  costs.  A  shortened  project  life \nbecause of inadequate O&M and a deterioration of irrigation facilities is the biggest risk to \neconomic performance. If irrigation intensity is reduced by 25% in kharif and by 25% in rabi \nseason, the EIRR decreases to 24.1%. The switching value occurs at a 40% reduction in \nirrigation intensity. Rice is the primary crop making up 82% of the production from the scheme \nat full development. If the economic farmgate price of rice is reduced by 20%, the EIRR will \ndecrease to 25.1%. The switching value occurs at a 45% reduction in the farmgate price. The \noverall level of benefits is realistic. A sensitivity test for an overall 20% decrease in the level of \nbenefits reduces the EIRR to 26.7%. The switching value is at a 55% decrease in agricultural \nbenefits. Overall the Banki scheme is found to be robust as evidenced by the high EIRR and the \nhigh switching values for various parameters in the sensitivity analysis. The scheme is most \nsensitive to a reduction in irrigation intensity, particularly in the rabi season, when most of the \nincremental benefits from full irrigation occur.  \nD.  Overall Project Analysis \n1.  Project Costs, and Benefits and Assumptions \n14.  Project Costs. Economic and financial analyses were prepared for the overall Project \nbased  on  the  detailed  analysis  of  the  four  pilot  subprojects  and  other  sector  information \nobtained  during  project  preparation.  The  proposed  Project  will  implement  R&U  on  about \n200,000 ha made up of 15-20 medium schemes averaging 5,000 ha each (approximately \n100,000 ha) and 200\u2013250 minor schemes (approximately 100,000 ha). Total project cost is \nestimated  at  $66.6  million,  including  contingencies,  interest  during  implementation,  and \ncommitment charges. The financial cost is converted to economic cost, using a SCF of 0.9 for \nnontraded items and a lower 0.85 SCF for R&U cost to allow for the higher unskilled labor \nelement of these costs. \n15.  Project  Benefits.  R&U  will  have  an  immediate  impact  in  increasing  the  utilization \npercentage of the irrigation systems. Irrigated cropping during kharif will increase to at least \n90% of the system's design potential in most schemes, and the percentage of cropping in rabi \nwill increase to a degree depending on the water supply that is available from the monsoon \nrains and the physical characteristics of the irrigation system. Increased irrigation potential \nallows farmers to diversify crops and to concentrate on crops with higher financial return. \nReduced risk and uncertainty will give farmers confidence to apply higher levels of crop inputs \nthan is the current situation. Therefore, coupled with the overall increase in cropping intensity, \nthere will be an increase in crop productivity as reliable irrigation generates increased yields, \nboth as a function of a more reliable water supply, and also as a result of an increased use of \ninputs. Developing PIM and strengthening the capacity of WUAs will help ensure adequate \nO&M of the newly rehabilitated schemes and their sustainable operation. \n16.  Irrigation Intensity and Productivity. The Project will give priority to schemes with low \nirrigation utilization due to severe dilapidation, and having an acceptable EIRR. It is assumed \nthat in the without-Project situation only 40% of the command area is irrigated during kharif and \nthe  rest  is  rain-fed.  With  the  Project,  the  percentage  receiving  supplementary  irrigation \nincreases to 90% and 10% remains rain-fed.2 The total benefits of increased irrigation intensity \nto 90% overall are assumed to build up over 3 years after R&U is completed (75%, 90%, 100% \nof 90%). Rabi cropping is almost entirely dependent on irrigation water since very little or no \nrainfall occurs during rabi. At present, because of the poor condition of the irrigation systems, \n                                                 \n2  It is not realistic to consider 100% irrigation intensity over the whole Project for wet season each year since there \nwill be some schemes where the full command area cannot be irrigated every year. ", "  Appendix 12  47 \nless than 10% of the total command area is capable of rabi cropping. With the Project, the rabi \ncropping area is expected to be 36% of the command area, with rabi crops being wheat (50%), \npulses  (25%),  oilseeds  (20%),  and  vegetables  (5%).  Giving  WUAs  in  R&U  subprojects \nagricultural support will help improve productivity by linking farmers with higher quality input \nproducers, supporting demonstration activities, and facilitating marketing for rabi production.  \n17.  Agricultural Benefits. The Project will implement PIM reforms and support WUAs over \nthe entire irrigated area in Chhattisgarh, which totals around 1.1 million ha net of the area for \nR&U activities. This will improve the revenue for, and execution of, O&M activities, lead to more \nreliable irrigation, increase agricultural productivity, and slow the rate of system degradation. \nImproving the management of irrigation schemes will make more water available for use in the \nrabi season. It is anticipated that for the state as a whole, strengthened WUA management and \nincreased  O&M  funds  going  to  the  field  level  will  result  in  an  estimated  5%  increase  in \nproductivity  over  time  in  areas  not  directly  affected  by  the  Project\u2019s  R&U  works.  This  is \nestimated to result in an additional 84,000 t of cereals, pulses, and oilseeds per year. \n18.  Priority Sluice Repair Program. The program will repair the sluices (headworks) of \nirrigation schemes that are inoperable. This will allow the release of water from the reservoir to \nbe controlled, resulting in improved irrigation management, expansion of rabi cropping, and \nfarmer incentives to invest more resources in O&M and management for the rest of the system. \nThe program is expected to give a 10% increase in agricultural production in both kharif and rabi \nseasons. Repair of approximately 500 minor schemes with an average command area of 200 \nha is planned, which is expected to result in an additional 16,000 t of production per year.  \n19.  WRD Capacity Building. Strengthening and modernizing the capacity of WRD will also \nhave an impact on the efficiency and sustainability of the irrigation sector. GOCG is currently \ninvesting a significant portion, around 20%, of its plan budget in irrigation, which is almost $100 \nmillion per year. Even a modest increase in the capacity to use these resources more effectively \ndue to project interventions will have a notable impact on the irrigation sector. \n2.  Economic Analysis of the Overall Project \n20.  Economic Analysis. The overall Project has an EIRR of 22.1% with a net present value \nof Rs1.58 billion ($35.13 million) and benefit-cost ratio of 1.79 at a 12% opportunity cost of \ncapital. Sensitivity analysis is applied to test the effects of changes in the main parameters \naffecting economic returns (Table A12.2). The overall project costs were based on the cost of \nthe four pilot subprojects investigated during the feasibility study and are assessed at an overall \nrate. The overall level of benefits is based on a realistic assessment of the level of agricultural \noutput that can be achieved with reliable supplies of irrigation water and assuming increased \nuse of inputs and improved practice. A sensitivity test on a 20% reduction in the general level of \nbenefits causes the EIRR to decrease to 18.1%. The economic analysis includes benefits that \nrelate to the wider irrigation sector and the management of water resources in Chhattisgarh. \nThis includes the development of PIM and WUAs and, to a lesser extent, capacity building for \nWRD. Excluding the overall benefits from these activities reduces the EIRR to 18.0%. The \nresults show that the Project is robust to changes in overall costs and benefits. The most \nsensitive factor is the level of irrigation intensity for the command area. This finding highlights \nthe importance of ensuring that systems achieve a high level of irrigation efficiency, and that \nfarmers are empowered to manage and have the resources for O&M to ensure the sustainability \nof the rehabilitated irrigation systems. \n \n \n \n \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nTable A12.2: Sensitivity Analysis Results for the Overall Project \nEconomic Internal  Switching \nItem  Sensitivityb \nRate of Return (%)   Valuea (%) \nBase Case  22.1     \n  Net Present Value at 12%  $35,131,748     \n  Benefit-Cost Ratio  1.79     \nInvestment R&U Cost       \n  20% Increase  20.40  265  0.0 \nIrrigation Intensity Area        \n  20% Decrease  18.10  40  0.2 \nRice Farmgate Price       \n  20% Decrease  18.20  45  0.1 \nBenefits       \n  20% Decrease  18.10  66  0.1 \nPIM Component       \n  Exclude General Benefits  18.00     \nPIM = participatory irrigation management, R&U = rehabilitation and upgrading. \na  The switching value is the level of change in the risk factor that causes the economic internal \nrate of return (EIRR) to fall below 12%, the opportunity cost of capital. \nb  Sensitivity is the absolute value of the percent change in the EIRR divided by the percent \nchange in the risk factor.  \n \nE.  Distribution and Poverty Impact Analysis \n21.  Project Beneficiaries. The Project will primarily affect rural agricultural communities, \nincluding some of the most disadvantaged people in Chhattisgarh. It is estimated that around \n120,000 landowning households will directly benefit. An additional 15,000 landless households \nwill also benefit from increased employment opportunity through the incremental demand for \nagricultural labor. In total, around three quarters of a million people will be directly affected by \nthe impact of R&U. The overall impact of strengthening PIM and WUAs on the total irrigation \nsector in the state will have a more widespread impact at a lower level through the increase in \nirrigation efficiency and improved management of the existing infrastructure. \n22.  Poverty Impact. The landless and marginal farmers are estimated to make up over 50% \nof the households in the project area. During project preparation, 69% of the families that were \nsurveyed kept the vast majority of the rice that they produced for home consumption. The \nProject will help stem the precarious situation with regard to food security in Chhattisgarh. The \nbenefits of the increased agricultural production are expected to accrue to all landowners. The \nmarginal small farms and the landless will gain from the increased opportunity for agricultural \nemployment over an extended agricultural calendar by more rabi cropping. Small poor farmers \nwill also have increased opportunity for work to meet the increased labor needs on the larger \nfarms. Employment will not only produce important financial benefits to the landless, but will \nalso reduce the hardship and need for families to go out of Chhattisgarh to find seasonal \nemployment. The average farm with 1.7 ha is expected to receive an incremental income of \n$180.02 (Rs8,100) per year (financial prices) from 3.0 t of crop production as a result of the \nProject, while marginal farmers with less than 0.5 ha will receive $62.97 as the extra value of \ntheir  0.88  t  increase  in  crop  production.  Secondary  and  related  agricultural  business \nopportunities are also expected to develop as a result of the increase in agricultural production. ", "  Appendix 13  49 \nSUMMARY RESETTLEMENT FRAMEWORK AND \nINDIGENOUS PEOPLES DEVELOPMENT PLAN \nA.  Introduction \n1.  The  Chhattisgarh  Irrigation  Development  Project  (CIDP)  involves  rehabilitating  and \nupgrading  existing  irrigation  infrastructure  under  a  loan  to  be  financed  by  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB).  The  Project  will  result  in  enhanced  agriculture  productivity  and \nregional food security by improving irrigation systems, enhancing the capacity of water users \nassociations (WUAs) and farmers, and promoting integrated water resources management. The \nProject provides for sustainable operations of irrigation infrastructure in subproject schemes \nthrough an intensive participatory process. The four core subprojects studied during the project \npreparation stage did not involve resettlement and are not anticipated to have land acquisition \n(LA) or negatively impact any tribal community. A large number of additional schemes will be \nselected for project support, but they are not expected to have any significant LA, resettlement, \nor impact on tribal communities. However, a resettlement framework and indigenous peoples \ndevelopment plan (IPDP) have been prepared, setting out the policies, principles, procedures, \nand implementation mechanisms to adequately address the issue of LA, resettlement, and \nimpacts on vulnerable people if they occur during project implementation. Although the intents \nand substance of the resettlement framework and IPDP address different issues, the framework \nand implementation arrangements for their execution under the Project are similar. \nB.  Resettlement Policies \n2.  ADB's policy on involuntary resettlement was adopted in November 1995. The policy \nrequires the following: (i) avoid or minimize resettlement impacts where possible, (ii) consult \nwith affected people (APs) including disclosure of the resettlement plan (RP) and project-related \ninformation, (iii) pay compensation at the market/replacement value, (iv) provide resettlement \nassistance  to  affected  people  including  persons  with  no  title  to  land,  (v)  ensure  income \nrestoration and rehabilitation, and (vi) give special attention to vulnerable groups. The policy \nobjectives and principles related to income restoration or having a bearing on it are as follows: \n(i) people unavoidably displaced should be compensated so that their economic and social \nfuture would be generally as favorable as it would have been without the project; (ii) any \ninvoluntary resettlement should, as far as possible, be implemented as part of a development \nprogram  and  RPs  should  be  time-bound  and  with  adequate  budgets;  (iii)  APs  should  be \nprovided resources and opportunities to reestablish their homes and livelihood as soon as \npossible; (iv) APs should be fully informed and consulted on compensation options; (v) existing \nsocial and cultural institutions of resettled persons and their hosts should be supported and \nused  to  the  greatest  extent  possible;  and  (vi)  resettled  persons  should  be  integrated \neconomically and socially into the host communities. \n3.  The  CIDP  resettlement  framework  is  also  based  on  India's  National  Policy  on \nResettlement and Rehabilitation (NPRR) that was adopted in 2004 and has many of the same \nprinciples as the ADB policy. The state of Chhattisgarh also developed a model policy on \nresettlement and rehabilitation (R&R) in the year 2002. Based on the Madhya Pradesh model, \nthe  Chhattisgarh  model  calls  for  the  following:  (i)  a  state-level  advisory  committee  with  a \nsociologist  and  economist  for  any  rehabilitation  project,  and  (ii)  identification  of  small  and \nmarginal farmers apart from landowners, because cash compensation alone is not sufficient to \nrehabilitate APs. \n4.  The principles of the project resettlement framework draw from all the aforementioned \npolicies and include the following: (i) negative impacts will be minimized as much as possible; \n(ii) compensation will be paid at replacement value to improve or at least restore preproject \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \nincomes and living standards; (iii) APs will be consulted on the issues of LA, compensation, and \nR&R assistances options; (iv) compensation and assistance will be paid in full before physical \nrelocation; (v) a grievance redress mechanism will be established in every district to ensure \nspeedy resolution of conflicts; and (vi) all efforts will be made to ensure the participation of \nvulnerable  groups  in  plan  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring.  The  resettlement \nframework sets out the eligibility and entitlements for loss of land or other immovable properties, \nor  income  loss  (Supplementary  Appendix  D  includes  the  compensation  matrix).  Affected \nhouseholds may be entitled to a combination of compensation measures and resettlement \nassistance, depending on the nature of ownership rights of lost assets, scope of impacts, and \nthe social and economic vulnerability of APs. \nC.  Indigenous/Tribal Issues and Policies \n5.  Over three fifths of the total geographic area of Chhattisgarh comes under scheduled \nareas by notification of the President of India under the fifth schedule of the Constitution of \nIndia. Of the total population of the state, over 35% is tribes. Thus Chhattisgarh has the largest \ntribal concentration in the country. A total of 42 communities have been declared as scheduled \ntribes under Article 342 of the Constitution of India and five tribal groups have been identified as \nprimitive tribal groups by the Government of Chhattisgarh. Most of these tribes are poor and \nilliterate. The work participation rate among them is 52% and, among the workers, 86% either \npractice agriculture or are engaged in allied agriculture activities. \n6.  Under the fifth schedule of the Constitution of India, certain tribal areas of the state have \nbeen declared as scheduled areas, which have special regulations for (i) transfer of land by \nmembers of scheduled tribes, (ii) allotment of land to members of such tribes, and (iii) the \nbusiness of moneylending. The first Act to protect tribal land from being alienated was passed \nby the Central Provinces and Berar (presently Madhya Pradesh) as the Land Alienation Act, \n1916. Another law applicable to the Madhya Bharat region only and known as Madhya Bharat \nScheduled Areas (Allotment and Transfer of Land) Regulation was passed in 1954. Both laws \naimed  to  check  indiscriminate  transfer  of  tribal  land  without  the  permission  of  the  district \ncollector. After recognition of the states, the Madhya Pradesh Land Revenue Code (1959) \nbecame the basic document for the two states. The NPRR also gives preference to tribal \ncommunities in land allotment. The NPRR advocates resettling tribal members close to their \nnatural habitat in a compact block, so that they can retain their ethnic, linguistic, and cultural \nidentity.  \n7.  ADB uses the following characteristics to define indigenous people: (i) descent from a \npopulation group present in a given area before territories were defined; (ii) maintenance of \ncultural  and  social  identities  separate  from  dominant  societies  and  cultures;  (iii)  self-\nidentification and identification by others as being part of a distinct cultural group; (iv) linguistic \nidentity different from that of the dominant society; (v) social, cultural, economic, and political \ntraditions and institutions distinct from those of the dominant culture; (vi) economic systems \noriented more toward traditional production systems rather than mainstream; and (vii) unique \nties and attachments to traditional habitats and ancestral territories.  \n8.  Based on both India\u2019s legal, constitutional, and developmental strategies and ADB\u2019s \npolicy on indigenous people, the objectives of an IPDP are to ensure (i) that affected tribal \npeople/scheduled tribes benefit from the Project; (ii) that they are included in the entire process \nof  planning,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  the  CIDP;  (iii)  that  affected  tribal  people/ \nscheduled tribes receive benefits from the Project that are at least on par with or better than \nthose received by the rest of the population (this may require special measures and preferences to \ntribal people over others); and (iv) that a basis is provided for the tribal groups in the area to \nreceive adequate development focus. The need for a full IPDP will be established on the basis ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nof the following criteria set out in ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people to determine if project \nimpacts are significant: (i) adverse impacts on customary rights of use and access to land and \nnatural resources; (ii) negative impacts on socioeconomic and cultural identity; (iii) impacts on \nhealth, education, livelihood, and social security status; and (iv) any other impacts that may alter \nor undermine indigenous knowledge and customary institutions (Supplementary Appendix E). \nD.  Institutional Framework and Implementation Arrangements \n9.  To  address  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples  activities,  the  Water  Resource \nDepartment (WRD) will establish a Social Development Unit (SDU) that will be responsible for \npolicy  guidance,  coordination  and  planning,  internal  monitoring,  and  overall  reporting  for \nresettlement, indigenous peoples, social assessment, economic evaluation, and environment. \nWRD will appoint an executive social development officer to head the SDU, supported by a \nsenior resource person recruited for the life of the Project and with an appropriate social or \nanthropological background. The SDU will be responsible for determining if an RP or an IPDP is \nneeded,  based  on  the  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  that  is  carried  out  for  each \nsubproject and discussions with the Design Unit and other WRD and project staff. If an RP, any \nLA, or IPDP is deemed necessary, consultant and nongovernment organization (NGO) support \nwill be engaged to prepare and help implement the RP and IPDP in full consultation with the \nAPs.  The  NGO  will  work  in  close  association  with  involved  WRD  staff  to  ensure  smooth \nimplementation  of  the  RP/IPDP,  including  disbursement  of  assistance,  providing  livelihood \nsolutions, upgrading of skills, etc. \n10.  At  the  district  level,  one  WRD  executive  engineer  will  be  designated  as  social \ndevelopment liaison officer (SDLO),1 to be responsible for resettlement, indigenous peoples, \nand other SDU activities. For each subproject, the RP or IPDP will be implemented through a \ndistrict  level  committee  (DLC)  that  will  be  established  in  each  district  as  needed.  For \nresettlement, the DLC will include the following members: (i) SDLO and WRD staff member \nresponsible for the subproject; (ii) district magistrate or his/her representative; (iii) district LA \nofficer  or  his/her  representative,  (iv)  representative  of  the  Revenue  Department;  (v) \nrepresentative  of  the  panchayat  (local  rural  government)  in  the  affected  village;  (vi) \nrepresentative of the WUA, line departments involved with the RP; (vii) APs, including women; \nand (viii) a local NGO. \n11.  In the case of the IPDP, the DLC will be formed under the chairmanship of the district \nmagistrate or his/her representative with the block development officer/chief executive officer as \nmember secretary. The DLC will include the following members (i) members of the DLC and the \nproject administrator for the local Integrated Tribal Development Project, (ii) WRD SDLO for that \ndistrict,  (iii)  line  agency  representatives,  (iv)  two  tribal  representatives,  and  (v)  an  NGO \nrepresentative. The DLC will be responsible for regularly reviewing of progress, approving micro \nplans,  and  coordinating  with  local  government  authorities  and  their  field  offices.  For \nimplementing the IPDP, a village-level committee (VLC) will be formed with the help of an NGO, \nwhich will include representation from tribal families, the leader of the tribal community, and \nother  village  leaders.  The  committee  will  have  at  least  15  members  with  substantial \nrepresentation  of  women  (with  a  target  33%).  The  committee  will  list  the  needs  of  the \ncommunity and prepare village-level action plans for a particular year. The NGO will facilitate \nplan preparation and group meetings and ensure that the VLCs have all requisite information on \n                                                 \n1  The SDLO's role will be in addition to the regular responsibilities of the executive engineer, and training will be \nprovided. For day-to-day oversight of R&R activities, the SDLO may delegate responsibility to the assistant \nengineer associated with the specific project, but overall accountability will rest with the SDLO. Membership of the \nDLCs for both the indigenous peoples and resettlement activities will be harmonized to facilitate implementation. \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nprogram  contents  and  funds.  The  VLC  will  ensure  full  participation  of  villagers  in  IPDP \nprograms. \nE.  Consultation, Disclosure and Grievance Redress \n12.  The Project will ensure that APs for resettlement, impacted tribal members, and other \nstakeholders  are  informed,  consulted,  and  allowed  to  participate  actively  in  the  subproject \ndevelopment  process,  including  preparation,  implementation,  and  monitoring  of  subproject \nresults  and  impacts.  During  implementation  and  the  monitoring  stage,  information  will  be \ndisseminated to APs and other key stakeholders. The information will be in Hindi and presented \nin  the  subproject  area,  describing  the  main  subproject  features  including  the  entitlement \nframework for resettlement. Consultation will be carried out in ways appropriate for cultural, \ngender-based, and other differences among the stakeholders. Where groups or individuals have \ndifferent  views/opinions,  particular  emphasis  will  be  laid  on  the  views  and  needs  of  the \nvulnerable groups.  \n13.  Consultation  initiated  during  the  preparatory  stage  will  continue  during  the \nimplementation  stage.  For  resettlement,  consultations  during  implementation  will  involve \nagreements  on  compensation,  assistance  options,  and  entitlement  package  and  income \nrestoration.  Information  disclosure  will  be  pursued  for  effective  implementation  and  timely \nexecution of the RP.  For the benefit of the community in general and APs in particular, the RP \nand  R&R  policy  will  be  translated  into  the  Hindi  and  kept  at  the  panchayat  level,  block \ndevelopment office, tehsil office, district magistrate office, and WRD/SDU. \n14.  The RP will be disclosed to the APs and other stakeholders for review and comments on \nthe mechanisms and entitlement in implementing the RP. The aim of this procedure is to receive \ncomments from the APs in particular and incorporate the appropriate suggestions if technically \nfeasible.  \n15.  Grievance redress committees (GRCs) will be set up with the development of all RPs to \nassist the APs in redressing grievances within a stipulated time frame of 15 days. The GRC will \nmeet once in 15 days to expedite redress of grievances. It will comprise (i) representatives of a local \nNGO;  (ii)  public  representatives  (viz.,  member  of  Parliament,  member  of  the  legislative \nassembly, district magistrates office etc.) from respective districts; (iii) a representative of a \nwomen's group; (iv) vulnerable APs; (v) line department; and (vi) the representative of the \ndistrict administration. Participation of women in the GRC will have a target of 33%. \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n16.  WRD will set up an internal implementation monitoring system comprising the SDU, its \nown field staff, and an NGO that is different from the one contracted to prepare or implement the \nRP or IPDP. Monitoring indicators will be established by WRD with ADB concurrence. The \nmonitoring for resettlement or in indigenous peoples activities and plans will be a part of the \nADB Project Performance Monitoring System established for the overall Project.  ", "  Appendix 14  53 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction and Project Description \n1.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  of  anticipated  environmental  impacts \nassociated with the Chhattisgarh Irrigation Development Project (CIDP) was prepared according \nto  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB\u2019s)  Guidelines  on  Environmental  Assessment.  The \nExecuting  Agency  will  be  the  Water  Resources  Department  (WRD)  of  the  Government  of \nChhattisgarh. The Project will be implemented throughout the state over 7 years beginning in \n2005. The CIDP has 3 institutional and capacity building sector-oriented subcomponents to \nstrengthen  the  (i)  WRD,  (ii)  water  user  associations  (WUAs),  and  (iii)  agricultural  support \nservices. A fourth component involves the rehabilitation and upgrading (R&U) of about 10\u201320 \nmedium  and  200\u2013300 minor  existing  irrigation  schemes  for  a  total  area  of  about  200,000 \nhectares (ha). The IEE examined the overall sector and R&U components and within the latter, \ntwo medium (Balar and Banki) and two minor (Darki and Pakanjore) irrigation schemes that \nwere selected as core subprojects during project preparation. The IEE did not indicate negative \nimpacts from the Project, and anticipated positive long-term environmental benefits from all the \ncomponents except system rehabilitation. The following presents an IEE from a subproject \nduring project preparation under the technical assistance. \nB.   Introduction to the Balar Medium Scheme IEE \n2.  The  Balar  medium  scheme  IEE  was  completed  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on \nEnvironmental Assessment for a category \u201cB\u201d Project. The IEE was completed to meet three \nobjectives:  (i)  to  predict  the  magnitude  of  potential  environmental  impacts  associated  with \nplanned subproject activities; (ii) to provide an environmental monitoring plan (EMP) to minimize \nor prevent the occurrence of negative impacts while maximizing positive effects; and (iii) to \npresent a framework for WRD, the local WUAs, and other relevant stakeholders in the area of \nthe scheme to implement environmental assessment and the EMP procedures of the subproject \n(Supplementary Appendix F). The scope of the IEE also recognized that detailed final design \nwould be completed during implementation of the Balar subproject, at which time this IEE may \nbe updated. The IEE has incorporated reviews of existing information combined with interviews \nand consultations/workshops among a sample of stakeholders in the scheme\u2019s area and from \nthe government. \n3.  Description of the Project. The Balar subproject is located in the Mahanadi Basin of \nthe central agroclimatic zone in Kasdol subdistrict of Raipur District. The existing structures of \nthe  Balar  irrigation  scheme  will  receive  R&U  combined  with  improved  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) and agriculture practices that will lead to diversification and value addition \nin farm produce, creation of jobs, and raising of farm and nonfarm income in the surrounding \ncommunity. Balar was constructed approximately 27 years ago and was originally designed to \nirrigate 5,567 ha. However, the existing facilities are deteriorated and only effective for 4,770 ha \nof the kharif (wet season) area and 200 ha of the rabi (dry season) area. The Balar reservoir is \nsupplied by run-off from a catchment area of about 82 square kilometers. Minor siltation has \ntaken place in the reservoir tank due to improper management of land resources upstream and \nadjacent to the reservoir. \n4.  Implementation of R&U. The objectives of developing the Balar subproject are to \n(i) provide R&U for the existing irrigation infrastructure; (ii) develop the capacity and roles of the \nWUAs for O&M of irrigation systems to ensure sustainable operations beyond the life of the \nProject; and (iii) enhance agriculture support services for yield improvement, crop diversification, \nand marketing. The R&U will include the following activities: (i) desilting and lining sections of \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \nthe main canal; (ii) repair of the bench flume and aqueduct; (iii) repair and reconstruction of \ncross regulators; (iv) repair of vehicle and foot bridges; (vi) repair of drops; (vii) installing gates; \nand (viii) construction of watercourses and field channels. R&U construction activities would be \nconfined to small areas of land in and around the structures being repaired and installed. O&M \nwill be led by the WUAs in collaboration with WRD. A period of 2 years is proposed to complete \nR&U of the Balar system from the start of final design through to completion of civil works.  \nC.   Description of the Environment of Balar \n5.  Physical Resources. The command area is mainly a flat plain, while in the vicinity of \nthe  dam/reservoir  catchment  area,  the  topography  varies  from  undulating  terrain  to  small \nhillocks covered with forest. The geology consists mostly of granite, gneiss, and associated \nbasic and ultrabasic intrusives, while soils are sandy loam and clay. Rainfall from May to \nNovember causes flash floods while temperature varies from a minimum of 100C to a maximum \nof 400C. The depth of groundwater varies from 10 to 100 meters as per local information. Use of \ngroundwater for irrigation in the area is rare. Some groundwater is used for livestock and \ndomestic pruposes. No information was available on water quality at the time of this report. \n6.  Biological Resources. The area's aquatic and wildlife resources are considered of \nminor significance. The forests are mostly \u201cdry deciduous type.\u201d Reserve/protected forests do \noccur in the area of the scheme. Despite restrictions on resource use in the protected areas, it \nwas observed that encroaching activities are occurring in the upper areas of the catchment. \nVegetation  is  being  cleared  and  soils  are  being  exposed.  Overall  forest  cover  has  been \ndegraded  by  human  activities,  yet  is  still  essentially  in  tact.  Overgrazing  by  livestock  is \nconsidered a leading cause of soil degradation and continues to persist.   \n7.  Economic and Social Conditions. The availability of economic data in the area of the \nscheme is minimal.  However, Balar is regarded as situated in an underdeveloped area of the \nstate. Agriculture is the dominant contributor to the local economy, and residents rely almost \nentirely on agriculture for employment. Agriculture production is far below potential due to the \nstate of irrigation facilities and poor agricultural practices. During low production periods, local \nsources  of  livelihood  are  supplemented  by  collecting  nontimber  forest  products  such  as \nfirewood, bamboo, resins, berries, various leaf herbs, and myrobalan. About 50% of the people \nare marginal farmers, and the average landholding is about 1 ha. There is little industry or any \ntype of mineral wealth. Roads are mostly unpaved and communication linkages are poor.  \n8.  Social and Cultural Conditions. R&U of the Balar facilities is likely to benefit more than \n25,000 people spread over 23 villages. About 50% of the population belong to scheduled tribes. \nThe dominant tribes are Gonds, Binjhwar, Baiga and Karwar. Health care is available at the \nprimary health center. Literacy rate is about 30-40%, and primary schools are available locally, \nbut attendance levels are uncertain. There are no cultural, historical, or archaeological sites of \nimportance. The Balar area is characterized by large-scale landlessness, underemployment, \nilliteracy,  frequent  crop  failure,  and  high  percentage  of  tribal  population  with  skewed  land \ndistribution. All these factors contribute to poverty among the population. Poor communication \nlinkages and difficult living conditions have resulted in the limited presence of nongovernment \norganizations  in  the  area  such  that  targeted  poverty  reduction  programs  have  not  been \ndeveloped to any significant extent. \nD.  Forecasting Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n9.  The examination of potential environmental impacts has been completed according to \nthe methodology described in the overall IEE of the CIDP to identify significant positive or \nnegative  environmental  effects  associated  with  the  proposed  R&U  and  O&M  of  the  Balar ", "  Appendix 14  55 \nfacilities. A three-tiered impact rating scheme was applied with the temporal (e.g., short-term, \nlong-term) and spatial considerations for the Balar subproject as presented below. Where the \npotential for significant negative environmental impacts to occur was identified, mitigation or \nenvironmental safeguards were described and incorporated in the EMP portion of the IEE.  \n10.  Physical/Chemical  Component.  Relevant  indicators  included  noise,  soils,  and \nhydrology. Dam safety and its influence on hydrologic events were addressed separately in the \nproject  preparatory  documents.  Elevated  noise  levels  may  occur  only  during  construction \nassociated  with  various  equipment  and  worker  activities  creating  nuisance  to  nearby \ncommunities. However, these are expected to be of short duration and spatially limited to each \nconstruction  site.  Contractors  can  be  made  aware  of  the  potential  and  incorporate  simple \nmeasures in equipment operation and worker behavior to avoid annoying noise effects on \ncommunities. No impact is expected. \n11.  Soil salinization does not appear as an issue in the command area, while soil erosion \nwarrants consideration. In general the risk of soil erosion during construction is low. The activity \nwill be limited spatially to where facilities are being upgraded and installed and temporally by \nbeing conducted primarily during the rabi season. Further safeguards associated with on-site \nactivity and clean-up can be incorporated into the final design and into contractors\u2019 conditions of \nwork. However, it appears that current land use practices in the area have already created \nseveral  sources  of  soil  erosion  particularly  in  the  upper  portions  of  the  catchment.  This \nheightens the soil erosion risk that could compromise the sustainability of an R&U irrigation \nscheme. The active life of a reservoir can be shortened by increased sedimentation resulting \nfrom erosion. Additional requirements for canal desilting that may become necessary can pose \nan expensive cost element to O&M. These situations will need further evaluation at final design \nand may require soil stabilization (e.g., revegetation) in some of the areas bordering the R&U \nworks. Procedures during O&M will be needed to minimize sediment entry in the reservoir/tanks \nand  delivery  channels  that  could  compromise  the  efficiency  and  sustainability  of  the  R&U \nactions. Negative impacts of soil erosion arising directly from the Project are not expected. \nHowever, safeguards to manage sedimentation should be incorporated into O&M procedures \nfor a broader command area. \n12.  The hydrologic regime will change during O&M. The water use and release profile will \nneed to be sensitive to water demand from existing and potential future users in areas further \nremoved  (or  downstream  of  the  system).  This  condition  will  need  to  be  addressed  in  the \nmanagement of future water distribution to avoid conflicts. No impact is projected, subject to \ngood procedures for irrigation management that match demand and supply with people\u2019s needs \nbeing incorporated in the final design and O&M packages. \n13.  While water quality data was unavailable at the time of this assessment, it is expected \nthat  more  stable  water  flow  will accompany  O&M.  Stagnant  areas would  be  reduced  and \naccumulation of domestic and livestock waste in the Balar scheme will decrease. Portions of the \nnutrient  loads  from  the  existing  domestic  waste  streams  would  also  be  taken  up  by  the \nagricultural crops. Fertilizer and pesticide use may increase and application rates may require \nattention, and the Project includes an agricultural extension component that will provide training \non  appropriate  application  of  agrochemicals.  No  detectable  effects  on  water  quality  are \nexpected, subject to incorporating safeguards that address community sanitation (during the \nparticipatory  irrigation  management  component)  and  proper  procedures  for  the  use  of \nagriculture pesticides and fertilizers (under the agriculture support component). \n14.  Biological Components. The terrestrial and aquatic habitats in the Balar scheme area \ncontinue to be extensively disrupted by human activities. Relevant indicators include forest \nresources/protected areas and waterborne diseases. During construction, clearing land for R&U \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \nof  existing  structures  or  installing  some  new  structures  may  encroach  on  the  existing \nforested/protected areas. Most of the activity is expected to be limited within areas already \ndisturbed in and around the existing facilities. \n15.  The main concern is during O&M and the indirect impacts related to ongoing community \nencroachment on undisturbed land resources, which will continue even without the Project. \nRealization of the benefits of improved agricultural production from R&U of the Balar scheme \nmay, however, further increase human activity and intensify the encroachment already occurring \non  existing  forested/protected  areas  (e.g.,  extraction  of  resources  for  nontimber  products). \nContinued removal of sensitive forest resources will threaten the sustainability of the scheme \n(e.g., soil erosion). Forest and watershed issues are managed by the Department of Forestry, \nwhich oversees strict management of forest resources and their sustainable exploitation in \nChhattisgarh.1 Boundaries of forest and catchment areas will need to be identified (subproject \npreparation for R&U will provide a topographic survey of the irrigation system and catchment \narea, which can be used for planning with the IEE) and continued encroachment managed \nthrough  local  awareness  raising  and  facilitating  greater  community  participation  leading  to \nappropriate safeguards being incorporated into the daily routines of local residents. During \nrevision of the IEE and final preparation for the subproject, watershed and forestry issues will be \nincorporated into the EMP, and cooperation with the Department of Forestry will be pursued as \nneeded to develop and implement the EMP. The IEE will also include development of livestock \ngrazing management measures to protect catchment resources as well as to address the \nproblem of livestock grazing on rabi crops to support increased rabi production. \n16.  In the case of Balar and other subprojects, linkages with the ongoing nationally funded \nRajiv  Ghandi  Watershed  Management  Program  may  be  possible  to  address  watershed \nmanagement  issues  in  relation  to  the  catchment  of  the  irrigation  system.  Overall,  with  a \nheightened sensitivity and management of current land use practices, R&U of the Balar scheme \nis not expected to pose direct significant environmental effects on any biological components of \nthe  environment.  Formation  of  WUAs  and  the  improved  condition  of  the  irrigation  system \nprovide an incentive and a means for improved management of catchment resources. \n17.  While data on the occurrence of waterborne diseases was not available during this \nassessment, the improved and more stable water flows are expected to reduce the occurrence \nof favorable habitats for disease vectors to flourish. Simple flushing of the system may also be \nemployed to control aquatic weeds and stagnant areas combined with minimizing settlements \nbordering on the scheme\u2019s facilities. Variation in water levels in paddy fields during the wetting \nand drying accompanying rice cropping is also effective against vector-borne diseases. Overall \nno significant negative environmental impact is anticipated. \n18.  Socioeconomic and Cultural Component. Indicators related to infrastructure services \nand heritage resources are not considered relevant to the Balar area. Infrastructure other than \nspecific to the R&U works is not expected to change. Heritage sites gazetted or recognized as \nprotected have not been identified in the area. Relevant indicators include population and \ncommunity changes, employment and income opportunities, social/cultural, gender/vulnerable \npersons, resettlement, and government fiscal effects. \n19.  Population and community changes are anticipated during construction. Construction \nmay increase the presence of persons from outside the community, since contractors will largely \nuse their existing staff for skilled positions. Construction may increase the demand for unskilled \nlabor, attracting newcomers to the area during the R&U works. It is likely that most unskilled \n                                                 \n1 Especially in many tribal areas, nonforest timber products such as tendu leaves provide significant income \nopportunities for local communities and management of forest resources is an important concern of communities \nas well as the Department of Forestry. ", "  Appendix 14  57 \nlabor will be sourced from the local community. The contractor will have to be sensitive to \npossible changes in demographics. Ethnic composition and worker-resident conflicts that could \noccur should be managed within the conditions of work. Once the scheme is operational, \nincreased prosperity among the villages is expected.  Population densities and the potential for \nin-migrants will increase but are more likely to arise from the reduced out-migration to urban \ncenters.  With  reduced  out-migration,  the  social  fabric  of  the  communities  is  expected  to \nstrengthen. This represents a major positive impact to the community inhabiting the Balar \nscheme area. \n20.  Employment  and  income  opportunities  are  expected  to  improve.  Construction  is \nexpected to create a \u201cspike\u201d in income opportunities over the implementation period. Where \nlocal unskilled labor is employed, a moderate positive benefit will remain within the community. \nWhile the effect will be limited spatially and temporally within the window of construction activity, \nthe size of the intervention and the 2 years of activity present a moderate positive immediate \nimpact to the communities in the area. As O&M and improved agricultural benefits are realized, \nthe immediate impact will be increased household incomes among the community and an \nenhanced quality of life\u2013a major positive benefit to local communities in and outside the area. \n21.  Social/cultural conditions will be influenced during construction, with a possible influx of \noutsiders during construction. This could lead to negative impacts on family kinships, roles, and \nresponsibilities among the communities. During a 2-year construction period, opportunities for \nthis to occur are much higher for medium schemes. Contractors will be encouraged to engage \nunskilled workers locally and will be sensitized to local social customs and issues to prevent \nnegative impacts. During O&M, the WUAs will be responsible for maintaining an appropriate \nallocation of water in the scheme. Worker commitments in the WUAs may also cause some \ndisruption  of  the  social  fabric  in  the  community  causing  negative  impacts.  The  CIDP \nparticipatory irrigation management (PIM) component will build a capability in the both the \nWUAs and the communities, and the overall improved participatory environment is predicted to \nrealize a major positive impact among the villages in the area and prevent the occurrence of \nnegative disruptions in the social/cultural fabric. \n22.  Considerations of gender and vulnerable groups will need to be updated and addressed \nduring implementation of the R&U subcomponent and in PIM policy reforms, and in WRD and \nWUA interactions that will specifically address such considerations as part of overall project \nimplementation. Opportunities for greater involvement of these groups in decision making for \nthe system will be supported. A major positive impact on gender and the vulnerable group fabric \nof the community is expected as PIM outputs are incorporated into construction and O&M \nactivities. \n23.  Resettlement  of  persons  is  not  anticipated,  yet  minor  land  acquisition  and  minor \ncompensation for temporary disruptions of economic activities may be required for pockets of \nthe local population. However, detailed surveys have not been conducted to assess the level of \nimpact.  A  detailed  survey  during  final  design  will  be  required  to  evaluate  the  potential \nresettlement  impacts.  Where  any  are  identified,  the  EMP  may  be  amended  under  ADB\u2019s \nresettlement  framework  for  displacement  and  compensation  related  to  land  acquisition, \nresettlement, and impacts on vulnerable people that may result. This issue has been addressed \nin the CIDP design.   \n24.  Government  fiscal  effects  will  be  influenced  by  the  development  and  O&M  of  the \nscheme. As a medium-scale scheme, the area involved is large. Management will be delegated \nto  the  local  WUAs  and  WRD  will  be  relieved  of  significant  management  and  some  fiscal \nresponsibility. This development is expected to contribute a moderate positive impact to the \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nstate  government  and  local  constituents.  Improved  irrigated  agriculture  production  is  also \nexpected to contribute additional local income to the state\u2019s domestic product. \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n25.  Institutional  Requirements  and  Responsibilities.  R&U  of  the  system  will  be \ncompleted  with  the  existing  facilities.  Traditional,  physical  mitigation  is  not  considered \nnecessary.  The  potential  for  adverse  impacts  will  be  managed  by  an  environmental \nassessment/EMP process that incorporates a core program of environmental safeguards in the \nconstruction and O&M procedures of the Balar subproject. Carrying out EMP responsibilities will \nalso depend on the human resources of WRD and WUAs to be developed as part of the CIDP. \n26.  WRD, assisted by the WUAs and the project consultants in the Social Development Unit \n(SDU)  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  EMP.  During  R&U,  the  responsibility  for \nimplementing the environmental safeguards will be on the contractor and monitored by the WUAs, \nassisted by WRD and the SDU. The WUAs will be responsible for leading O&M. The agricultural \nsupport services for the WUAs in systems that receive R&U (including project consultants and \nDepartment of Agriculture [DA] staff) will help the WUAs monitor the implementation and outputs \nof agricultural initiatives, including the use of pesticides and fertilizers, and provide feedback to \nWRD  and  the  WUAs.  The  institutional  capabilities  and  capacities  of  these  organizations, \nparticularly WRD and WUAs, will be developed and strengthened under the CIDP.   \n27.  WRD will be supported over the course of the CIDP with the necessary technical and \nfinancial  resources  to  update  this  IEE  and  carry  out  EMP  responsibilities  under  an \norganizational structure to extend beyond the life of the CIDP. For the Balar subproject, WRD \nstaff from the nearest field office will participate in the EMP process. WRD SDU will provide an \noversight function and serve as a link between the overall CIDP and Balar subproject activities. \nWRD field staff will be more hands-on in working with the WUA and community representatives. \nResponsibilities will involve (i) overseeing and updating the IEE and EMP, (ii) carrying out timely \nsubmission of reports to CIDP management for clearances where required, (iii) ensuring the \nrecommendations  of  EMPs  are  included  in  the  activities  of  the  Balar  subproject,  and  (iv) \nensuring EMP reporting is completed for project review and monitoring. \n28.  The WUAs with support of the WRD PIM Unit will identify representatives as early as \npossible  in  subproject  implementation  to  develop  the  skills  necessary  to  (i)  participate  in \nupdating the IEE (where required) for the final R&U design of their scheme, and (ii) undertake \naspects of the EMP as part of construction and O&M activities in order to manage negative \nenvironmental impacts and initiate remedial responses where appropriate. WRD with project \nconsultant support initially will assist in raising environmental awareness among WUA members \nand provide support to build appropriate capability in participatory environmental management \nand monitoring of the Balar scheme. The project consultants will advise on the institutional \nstructure in this regard and help build the capacity of staff to carry out their responsibilities. The \nproject consultants assisting with implementation of the EMP will consist of two environmental \nimpact assessment social specialists recruited internationally and nationally under the overall \nCIDP. Both experts will work in collaboration with all project consultants on the project team, \nWRD, WUA, and DA counterparts and various other stakeholders in delivery of the EMP.  \n29.  Environmental Monitoring Plan. The EMP consists of initiatives to strengthen the \nenvironmental knowledge and management capabilities of personnel in WRD, the WUAs, and \nother relevant stakeholders so they can carry out their respective EMP responsibilities.  The \nmain  elements  of  the  EMP  will  include  (i)  institutional  strengthening;  (ii)  updating  the \nenvironmental assessment for incorporation into final design, construction, and O&M; and (iii) \nimplementing the EMP core program. The content of these elements will be delivered according ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nto the EMP as presented in the CIDP IEE and adjusted specifically for application to the Balar \nsubproject during implementation. \n30.  Public Consultation and Information Disclosure. Public consultation and disclosure \nwas carried out from 15 April to 14 June 2004 during the project\u2019s preparation. Among the 23 \nvillages  in  the  Balar  scheme,  3  were  selected  for  focus  group  (FG)  sessions  linked  with \nhousehold surveys. Household survey information was obtained from the representatives of 58 \nhouseholds attending the FG sessions. Participants in FGs included (i) heads and members of \nhouseholds; (ii) groups/clusters of beneficiaries; (iii) village rural governments; (iv) WUAs; (v) \nlocal volunteer organizations and some NGOs (few are active in the area); (vi) government \nagencies and departments; and (vii) other project stakeholders (e.g., women, tribes, other \nvulnerable  groups).  Over  25%  represented  women  and  over  50%  scheduled  tribes.  Core \nactivities were (i) disseminating information and requesting villagers to attend FGs; (ii) sharing in \ndiscussing the opinions, perceptions, and preferences of the beneficiaries; (iii) involving the \nbeneficiaries in identifying problems and possible solutions; (iv) obtaining beneficiary views and \nacceptance of CIDP, particularly among the WUAs and farmers, and discussing the potential \nloss of a small portion of their land for construction of field channels; (v) assessing the influence \nof socioeconomic characteristics of village populations to better create supportive mechanisms \nfor planning and implementation (e.g., agriculture, water charges, WUA activities, etc.); (vi) \nidentifying  contentious  issues  related  to  project  impacts  (including  environmental)  on  the \ncommunity, if any; (vii) factoring the beneficiaries\u2019 opinions into design alternatives for R&U of \nthe irrigation schemes; (viii) identifying levels and scope of community participation in project \nimplementation,  particularly  O&M;  and  (ix)  reaching  an  understanding  of  the  overall \ndevelopment goals and benefits of the subproject for presentation in the final project preparation \nreport.  \n31.  Among the representatives surveyed in the Balar scheme, there was interest in R&U for \nthe system in order to realize the improvements in irrigated agriculture they had expected 20 \nyears earlier when the Balar scheme was originally constructed. Site surveys and consultations \nconfirmed many of the existing environmental conditions presented herein and that agriculture, \ndespite the low productivity, remains a mainstay of local livelihoods. Residents indicated that the \nmain constraints to agriculture production were lack of reliable water and a properly organized \nWUA to voice out water needs in the area. Farmers indicated they would be prepared to pay \nwater charges for O&M provided the rates are reasonable and directly support mechanisms for \ntimely supply of water. Improving irrigation is viewed as a need and a mechanism to improve the \nquality of life. The consultative process will need to continue, particularly during final design, to \nstrengthen \u201cbuy-in\u201d and cooperation in finalizing the design and site conditions, and particularly \nin structuring the WUA. It is expected that a larger number of local stakeholders and villages will \nbe involved. \nF.   Findings and Conclusions for Balar IEE \n32.  Findings. The IEE did not predict negative environmental impacts associated with R&U \nof  the  Balar  subproject  that  could  not  be  identified  and  managed  through  the  IEE  and \ndevelopment of appropriate mitigating measures and the EMP. Any impacts that may occur, \nsuch as encroachment on the catchment area, are likely to occur without the Project, and a \nsignificant amount of disruption to the existing environment has already occurred from human \nactivities in the Balar area. The IEE will ensure that environmental safeguards are incorporated \nin the construction and O&M activities under the EMP, as well as address any other issues such \nas encroachment or overgrazing. The local environment is expected to improve under a post-\nproject condition. However, due to the importance of participatory procedures attached to CIDP, \npublic consultations will continue in order to ensure local considerations are incorporated in the \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nfinal design of the Balar's R&U, the construction, and O&M procedures. The IEE and EMP \nresults will be updated to address unique situations where they occur. \n33.  In the Balar system, preventing negative impacts and maximizing positive benefits will \nalso  rely  heavily  on  the  success  of  the  WUA  and  WRD  in  carrying  out  their  respective \nconstruction and O&M responsibilities in a participatory, collaborative manner. This will be \nreinforced by institutional strengthening components under the overall CIDP initiative, including \nEMP training specified in the EMP portion of the R&U subcomponent. Failure to implement \nsustainable O&M mechanisms will compromise the expected increase in irrigated agriculture \nproduction.  The  importance  of  O&M  in  realizing  of  long-term  socioeconomic  benefits  from \nimproved irrigated agriculture will need to be constantly reinforced during the PIM component \namong all the beneficiaries.  \n34.  Conclusions. R&U of the Balar scheme is unlikely to result in any serious negative \nenvironmental impacts or minor impact that cannot be mitigated. While some refinements will be \nrequired  prior  to  final  design,  construction,  and  O&M  procedures,  an  EMP  that  relies  on \nenvironmental safeguards will be applied during all phases of Balar scheme development to \nprevent  the  occurrence  of  negative  impacts  while  maximizing  the  occurrence  of  positive \nimpacts. Collectively, R&U of the Balar system is expected to support a sustainable agriculture \nsystem that will enhance the livelihood of the people through higher and more stable incomes. If \nthe Balar scheme is not rehabilitated, the scheme and the land resources in the area will \ncontinue to deteriorate. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050401152211+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20050301163043+08'00'", "Title": "Chhattisgarch Irrigation Development Project", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
