INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  cluster  will  support  the \nimplementation of the Climate Change Operational Framework 2017\u20132030 (CCOF2030) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), which defines how ADB can facilitate a regional shift onto a \ndevelopment path that is climate-resilient and low in greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the \nParis Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals, and the Sendai Framework for Disaster \nRisk Reduction.1 The TA cluster will help boost the capacity of developing member countries \n(DMCs) for meeting their climate objectives by (i) assisting in refining and translating nationally \ndetermined contributions (NDCs) into climate investment plans, which may be implemented with \nADB assistance; (ii) improving DMCs' access to external public and private climate finance, \nincluding  support  for  innovative  financing  mechanisms;  and  (iii)  developing  methods  and \napproaches to establish baselines and monitoring tools for indicators to measure and gauge DMC \nprogress on climate actions and ADB\u2019s contribution to these actions. \n \n2.  The TA cluster is strongly aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, particularly the operational \npriority  of tackling  climate change,  building  climate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability.2 It is included in the 2018\u20132019 Climate Change and Disaster Risk \nManagement Thematic Group work plan.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The achievement of the Paris Agreement depends on the implementation of progressively \nmore ambitious climate actions, including those described in DMC NDCs.4 However, NDCs in \ntheir current form are insufficient to meet the 2\uf0b0C target.5 Given the lack of public financial \nresources,  weak  financial  and  institutional  systems,  and  limited  climate  knowledge  and \nawareness,  external  support  in  the  form  of  finance,  technology,  knowledge,  and  capacity \ndevelopment is needed to implement the current NDCs, and to design and implement more \nambitious NDCs. \n \n4.  Significant  investments in  low-carbon  and  climate-resilient  infrastructure  are  needed \nacross developing Asia, where ADB assessed the infrastructure gap to total $26.2 trillion, or \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

The \nTA cluster also supports priorities outlined in the Review of 2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan (ADB. 2017. Review of \n2011 Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila); an internal ADB directive to promote the use of high-level technology in \nprojects (ADB [Office of the President]. 2016. Use of High-Level Technology in Projects. Memorandum. 21 April [internal]); \nand the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020, particularly the operational directions on \nstrengthening connectivity between economies and investing in regional public goods and collective action (ADB. 2016. \nOperational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting Connectivity, Competitiveness, Regional \nPublic Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila). \n3  ADB. 2018. 2018-2019 Work Plans of Thematic Groups. Memo from Director General, Sustainable Development and \nClimate Change Department, and Chief Economist and Director General, Economic Research and Regional Cooperation \nDepartment to the President. 21 February. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on \n13 September 2018. \n4  NDCs outline countries\u2019 commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and their climate adaptation priorities. As of \nSeptember 2018, 38 of 40 DMCs receiving ADB financing support have ratified the Paris Agreement. The Kyrgyz Republic \nand Uzbekistan are the remaining DMCs that have not ratified the Paris Agreement. \n5  Climate Action Tracker. The Climate Action Tracker estimates that the planned contribution in most NDCs is not in line with \nefforts to meet the Paris Agreement\u2019s long-term goal to limit warming to 2\uf0b0C while aiming for 1.5\uf0b0C. \n \n ", "2 \n$1.7 trillion annually, during 2016\u20132030.6 To mobilize the needed investment, DMC governments \nmust devise climate investment plans and develop climate projects that help mobilize financing \nfrom various sources, particularly the private sector. However, most NDCs do not match climate \nactions with concrete financing mechanisms, including green bonds, project bonds, climate risk \ninsurance, or guarantee facilities. Consequently, opportunities to mobilize financing are not fully \npursued,  and  the  resulting  lack  in  resources  hampers  climate  action  and  undermines  the \nachievement of NDC objectives. \n \n5.  Transparency and accountability are also key factors in the successful delivery of the Paris \nAgreement and the Sustainable Development Goals. Results-based monitoring and evaluation is \na powerful tool for ensuring transparency and accountability on finance flows and climate actions. \nEstablishing reliable monitoring systems and enabling the measurement of progress will be useful \nfor DMCs to effectively monitor the achievement of their climate and development goals, and also \nhelp ADB measure progress toward the CCOF2030 and Strategy 2030 climate finance objectives \nand their contributions to climate and development outcomes in DMCs. \n \n6.  The CCOF2030 underscores ADB\u2019s commitment to helping its DMCs meet their climate \ncommitments, including by supporting the implementation of their NDCs and facilitating access to \npublic, private, domestic, and international climate finance. In November 2017, ADB formally \njoined the NDC Partnership, an international grouping of countries, development agencies, and \ninternational financial institutions that coordinates support for developing countries to gain access \nto financial, technology-related, knowledge, and capacity development assistance to achieve \nambitious climate goals while enhancing sustainable development.7 ADB supports DMCs in the \npursuit  of  their  climate  and  development  objectives  by  providing  TA,  facilitating  innovative \nfinancing, disseminating knowledge, developing capacity, and building partnerships. \n \n7.  The  TA  cluster  will  contribute  to  ADB\u2019s  support  for  DMCs  in  implementing  NDCs, \nmobilizing finance, and monitoring and tracking climate actions and financial flows in line with the \nParis Agreement. DMCs have articulated the need for such support during the DMC consultation \non the CCOF2030 and increasingly through DMC requests via the NDC Partnership (e.g., from \nthe Marshall Islands, Mongolia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam).8 Responding to this will enable \nADB to identify and meet climate financing and capacity development needs in DMCs. This will \nhelp achieve the Strategy 2030 target of 75% of ADB\u2019s operations being climate relevant by 2030, \nand ADB\u2019s own climate investment reaching $80 billion cumulatively during 2019\u20132030.9 \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n \n8.  By collectively supporting the CCOF2030 implementation, the proposed subprojects are \nstrategically linked to a common overall objective of enhancing the capacity of DMCs for climate \naction implementation. In contrast to a stand-alone TA, the TA cluster modality allows for flexibility \nin expanding outputs and integrating any future initiatives to support CCOF2030 implementation. \n \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2017.

Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n9.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: low-carbon development and climate \nresilience in Asia and the Pacific enhanced.10 The TA cluster will have the following outcome: \ncapacity of selected DMCs for implementing climate actions enhanced.11 \n \n10.  Output 1: Implementation of NDCs in selected DMCs supported. The TA cluster will \nassist DMCs in developing and implementing their NDCs. It will support (i) regional, national, \nsector, or subsector assessments of the needs and concrete opportunities for sovereign and \nnonsovereign climate investment, in line with NDC priorities; (ii) the development of climate \ninvestment plans for selected sectors or subsectors that outline how NDC objectives may be \nachieved by mobilizing finance from appropriate sources and mechanisms, implementing a \nsupportive policy and institutional framework, and developing adequate knowledge and capacity; \nand (iii) the identification and development of climate change priority project preconcepts for \nimplementation through ADB sovereign and/or nonsovereign assistance. The TA cluster will help \nDMC governments carry out effective outreach and engagement with domestic and international \nfinance providers and other stakeholders to facilitate a scaled-up climate investment for the \nrealization of NDC objectives. It will further build DMC capacity for NDC-related investments, and \nsupport the conduct of national and regional consultations and training workshops on climate \nchange risk management and investments. Selected reports will be published as knowledge \nproducts, with limited print copies disseminated to stakeholders from DMCs and development \npartners. Activities under output 1 will be closely coordinated with regional departments. \n \n11.  Output 2: Financial mechanisms to develop the climate actions of DMCs enhanced. \nThe TA cluster will deliver a review of ADB climate finance projects to gather examples of best \npractices from the public and the private sectors, including an analysis of vehicles to catalyze \nprivate capital, such as direct project finance (lending, guarantees, syndications, and equity \ninvestments);  blended  finance;12  and  public\u2013private  partnerships13  or  special  investment \nvehicles.14 It will develop an appraisal methodology to support regional departments in identifying \nrelevant climate finance sources or funds for DMCs in Asia and the Pacific, complete with a \nclassification of fund terms and conditions and with criteria to review the NDCs (mitigation, \nadaptation,  and  disaster  and  risk  management)  for  their  climate  finance  potential  (identify \ninnovative approaches across sectors, themes, and regions and define priority countries and \nsectors for operational support).15 It will also provide an analysis of enabling environments in \nselected priority DMCs to develop (i) public and/or private incentives for climate investments, \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA cluster will be undertaken in two to six DMCs (Appendix 2). \nThe selection of DMCs will be determined in close coordination with regional departments, aiming for a balanced \nrepresentation across ADB regions and DMC circumstances. \n12 Peer reviews by ADB\u2019s Strategy, Policy and Review Department will help ensure the consistency of approach when referring \nto blended finance.

The deliverables on innovative climate finance \ncan be articulated for DMCs in all regional departments. Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) resources will be \napplied to conduct analyses in DMCs that receive funding from the Asian Development Fund, particularly DMCs where \nsynergies can be identified with other components of the TA cluster and with stand-alone TA projects that support the \nCCOF2030 implementation. These DMCs include Bhutan, Cambodia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Myanmar, Nepal, Tajikistan, \nand Tonga. \n ", "4 \nwhich will lower the financial costs of such ventures; (ii) uniform standards on registration \nconditions and impact monitoring of such investments; and (iii) mechanisms to improve access to \nclimate finance. Output 2 will build on the work carried out under output 1 and will integrate an \nanalysis of regional infrastructure investment strategies and hurdles to transboundary climate \nfinance. The deliverables under output 2 will be published in digital and print format. Capacity \nbuilding workshops and knowledge events will be organized to disseminate output 2 findings. \n \n12.  Output 3: Mechanisms to measure, monitor, and report on commitments made \nunder the Paris Agreement established. The TA cluster will establish baselines and targets to \nsupport the monitoring of DMCs' progress toward meeting their NDC commitments, as well as \nADB\u2019s contribution to the NDC objectives. It will determine methodological issues and solutions \nto measure, monitor, and report on progress toward the climate and development goals. Under \noutput 3, the TA cluster will (i) develop results framework indicators for selected DMCs in line with \nNDC commitments; (ii) consult with selected DMCs on the links between the CCOF2030 results \nframework indicators and the NDC implementation priorities; (iii) work with ADB\u2019s operations and \nother departments to develop approaches for monitoring relevant CCOF2030 results framework \nindicators; and (iv) establish baseline and associated indicators under the CCOF2030, including \nrelated monitoring tools and systems. Knowledge products and services from this output will \nprovide overall guidance and tools to monitor the results framework of DMCs and ADB. Selected \nproducts will be published in digital format, with limited print copies. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $4,550,000, of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), (ii) $800,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6), and \n(iii) $3,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.16 Detailed cost \nestimates  and  financing  arrangements  will  be  presented  in  each  TA  subproject  proposal \nsubmitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management \nDivision of its Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will lead the overall \nimplementation of the subprojects. Target DMC selection, activities, and consultant outputs under \neach subproject will be closely coordinated with operations departments, resident missions, and \nsector and thematic groups. The Climate Change and Disaster Risk Management Division will \nselect, administer, and evaluate consultants.

These outputs will be in line with the \ndevelopment of CPSs and COBPs and will also be guided by \noperational processes and country dialogue efforts in \ncoordination with operational departments. \n \nCountry assessments will include assessments of in-country \nenabling environments, technologies, gaps, and opportunities for \nclimate financing. Preconcepts will be developed for priority \nclimate change mitigation and adaptation projects in the sectors \nor subsectors covered by the supported climate investment \nplans, to serve not only as investment opportunities for ADB but \nalso as a proof of concept on how NDC priorities may be linked \nto financing. Sectors that may be covered include agriculture and \nnatural resources, energy, transport, urban development, and \nwater. Preconcepts will likely include information on needed \ninvestment; potential cofinancing sources; climate mitigation \nand/or adaptation impact; relevance to DMC development and \nclimate plans, including their NDCs; non-climate co-benefits; and \nrequired policy, technology, and capacity building support for \nproject implementation. \n \nSubproject 1 outputs will be guided by related documents of the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and \ncorresponding assessments undertaken. It will build on the \nexperience of past and ongoing TA projects, e.g., a TA project \nthat successfully promoted climate technology investment \nplanning through the assessments undertaken and contributed to \nADB\u2019s CPS development and investment planning.b \n \nSubproject 1 will be implemented in four or five DMCs. The \nselection of DMCs will be determined in close coordination with \nregional departments. Priority will be given to DMCs where the \nCPS and/or COBP process will be initiated or where gaps exist \nand opportunities for NDC support can be maximized. \nSubproject 1 will also ideally aim to cover at least one DMC per \nregion, and DMCs with differing circumstances and NDC \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \ndevelopment. Coverage for additional DMCs or additional \nactivities will be subject to additional external cofinancing \nsupport. Subproject 1 will also inform, and benefit from, the \nfindings and outputs of subproject 2, e.g., innovative finance \nvehicles. ADB\u2019s membership of the NDC Partnership will help \nensure a coordinated approach with other development partners \nin supporting the implementation of NDCs. \n \nConsultants will be engaged to support the conduct of \nsubproject 1 activities and delivery of outputs. Subproject 1 \nactivities will include (i) developing selection criteria for the \nprioritization of DMCs and identification of targeted DMCs, \n(ii) conducting country assessments and consultations, \n(iii) holding national and regional consultations with governments \nand stakeholders to present assessment results and the \ndeveloped climate investment plans, and (iv) conducting training \nand/or workshops for climate-relevant government agencies on \nclimate change risk management and investments. Training, \nconsultations, and workshops will be monitored for effectiveness \nand/or inclusiveness. \n \nSelected reports will be published as knowledge products in \nEnglish and the local language, as needed, with limited print \ncopies disseminated to training and/or workshop participants \nfrom DMCs and development partners, including through the \nNDC Partnership. \n \nIndicative implementation  ADB, through the Climate Change and Disaster Risk \narrangements  Management Division under the Thematic Advisory Service \nCluster of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment, will be the implementing agency. Subproject 1 will \nbe implemented in close coordination with operations \ndepartments, including resident missions, and relevant sector \nand thematic groups (i.e., ESG, RDFS TG, TSG, USG, and \nWSG) to communicate on activities, including engagement of \nconsultants, and selected outputs. \n \nImplementation schedule  Subproject 1 is expected to be implemented from December \n2018 to November 2023. \n \nEnhancing Financial Mechanisms to Develop the Climate \nSubproject 2  Actions of DMCs \nIndicative outputs and activities  Linked to TA cluster output 2, subproject 2 will expand the TA \ncluster activities in selected DMCs, with a focus on analyzing \nfinancial mechanisms supporting climate actions. Subproject 2 \nwill enable the review of innovative financial instruments that can \nleverage ADB\u2019s own resources to attract climate finance and will \nassist DMCs in building enabling environments to catalyze \nclimate investments. It will also provide a review of ADB projects \nthat have promoted innovative financing modalities and develop \ncommon, cross-sector approaches and best practices to identify \nthe appropriate vehicles and strategies for attracting resources \nfrom the private sector. Subproject 2 will also integrate the \ndrivers of regional climate and infrastructure investment \nstrategies, notably in the CAREC subregion and in the GMS. \n \n ", "Appendix 2  11 \nThe outputs to be delivered under subproject 2 will include (i) a \nscoping paper on ADB best practice for climate finance \nmobilization; (ii) an appraisal of methodologies to support \nregional departments in the identification of relevant climate \nfinance vehicles; (iii) innovative blended finance vehicles for \npriority sectors; (iv) comprehensive sources of climate finance; \nand (v) assessments on enabling environments and \ntransboundary climate investments. \n \nSubproject 2 will be undertaken in four to six DMCs in at least \ntwo ADB regional departments. Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-6) resources will be applied to conduct analyses in \nDMCs that receive funding from the Asian Development Fund, \nparticularly DMCs where synergies can be identified with other \ncomponents of the TA cluster and with stand-alone TA projects \nthat support the CCOF2030 implementation. These DMCs \ninclude Bhutan, Cambodia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Myanmar, \nNepal, Tajikistan, and Tonga. \n \nThe selection of DMCs will be determined in close coordination \nwith regional departments and PSOD.

It will focus on developing results \nframework indicators in line with NDC commitments and the \nCCOF2030. \n \nSubproject 3 will be undertaken in at least two DMCs, guided by \nthe country selection of subproject 1. The outputs will be \ndelivered at the DMC level, in the context of monitoring NDC \ncommitments; and at the ADB level, in relation to the CCOF2030 \nimplementation. The outputs will include (i) stronger capacity of \nDMC representatives for monitoring the results framework and \nrelated NDC indicators; and (ii) an enhanced knowledge base on \nresults measurement, monitoring, and reporting, including the \ndevelopment of approach papers and country guidance notes \nand the establishment of a related database. \n \nCountry-specific results framework indicators are expected to \ncover focus areas of commitments made by the DMCs, mostly in \nenergy and transport. Performance indicators will include \nfinance, technology, emissions reductions, and land use. This \nsubproject will also make use of subproject 2 outputs in relation \nto financial instruments and enabling environments that lead to \nclimate finance investments. \n \nThe activities will be done in close consultation with country \nstakeholders and relevant climate agencies from select DMCs. \n \nAt the ADB level, results framework indicators will be developed \nin the context of the CCOF2030\u2019s monitoring and reporting \nmechanism, which will include refining its performance indicators \nand determining baselines and targets for these indicators. Some \nindicators cover performance on climate change mitigation \n(greenhouse gas emission reductions, renewable energy \ncapacity, and the like); climate change adaptation; climate \nfinance; and climate and disaster resilience. The subproject will \nalso consider the best approach or tool to measure these \nindicators, both in the interim, during a stocktaking exercise of \noutputs and achievements in 2023, and the final assessment by \n2030. \n \nConsultants will be engaged to support the conduct of \nsubproject 3 activities and delivery of outputs.
