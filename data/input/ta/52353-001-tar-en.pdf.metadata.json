The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation and \ninitial implementation of the Armenia Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy (TTFS), 2020\u2013\n2040, which will focus on developing (i) transport master plan, (ii) a trade facilitation plan, (iii) a \nroad safety plan and program, and (iv) modal action plans. \n \n2.  The TA is not included in the country operations business plan for Armenia, 2019\u20132021. \nThe Government of Armenia requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA support in a letter \ndated 19 November 2018.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Landlocked  Armenia  is  characterized  by  mountainous  terrain  and  extreme  weather \nfluctuations and is dependent on cross-border transport for trade.  Three factors lead to high trade \ntransaction costs for Armenia: (i) the legacy of a transport network developed under the former \nSoviet Union; (ii) being landlocked and (iii) two of its four international borders are closed, \nrestricting cross-border transport. These constraints drive up transport costs for traded goods and \nnecessitate expensive infrastructure rehabilitation and maintenance. In 2008, the government \ndeveloped the Armenia: Transport Sector Development Strategy, providing guidance for the \ntransport sector up to 2020.2 As 2020 approaches, a new strategy\u2014the proposed TTFS\u2014is \nneeded to (i) apply lessons learned from the previous strategy; (ii) broaden the scope of transport \nplanning to involve the private sector; (iii) expand on the previous strategy to incorporate trade \nfacilitation and traffic safety; and (iv) mainstream gender, environmental, social, and climate \nchange aspects. A well-prepared TTFS will help Armenia meet its economic goals, improve \ninternational cooperation and regional integration, and support the government\u2019s efforts to update \nthe Armenia Development Strategy 2014-2025.3 \n \n4.  Transport infrastructure can play a pivotal role in helping Armenia sustain its economic \ngrowth  and  diversify  its  foreign  trade.  The  government  consistently  prioritizes  transport \ninfrastructure improvements, but financing these improvements remains a challenge, and the \ncondition of the transport network has deteriorated as a result. Road conditions have deteriorated \nand of the 1,329 line-kilometers of rail network only about 500 kilometers are serviceable (but in \npoor condition), resulting in declining rail passenger and freight transport. Officially, Armenia has \nfive operational airports; however, almost all international flights are through Zvartnots Airport in \nYerevan, while a limited number of domestic flights serve Shirak Airport in Gyumri. \n \n5.  Road safety conditions in Armenia are poor, with an estimated 550 road fatalities per year \nand about 1% of gross domestic product per year lost because of road traffic crashes.4 Pre-\nrequisites for sustained road safety improvements include establishing a coordinated committee \non road safety across government ministries, high-level political support, improved data for \nmonitoring crashes, and improved traffic laws and better enforcement. \n \n6.  The government has requested ADB support to develop a TTFS that will contain action \nplans defining resource allocation and will assign responsibilities for short-term, medium-term, \nand long-term development. The TTFS and action plans will (i) improve transport infrastructure, \n                                                 \n1  Request letter from the Government of Armenia (government) is in Appendix 3 (Supplementary Document 2). \n2  ADB. 2008.

ADB is already in talks with the government and development partners to improve \nconnectivity and regional integration for Armenia through various mechanisms that will serve as \na basis for developing the TTFS. \n \n7.  This TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Armenia, 2014\u20132018 and \nwill serve as a first step toward aligning Armenia\u2019s transport sector with the operational priorities \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030.5 The TA will complement other regional cooperation programs such as \nthe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program, the Belt and Road Initiative, and the \nEuropean  Commission  Trans-European  Transport  Network.  The  TA  will  support  regional \nintegration, promote ADB as a prime development partner in the transport sector, and underpin \nADB\u2019s goal of solid long-term engagement in Armenia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) long-term prosperity promoted for the \nwhole nation through the development of efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally and socially \nsustainable transport infrastructure and services; and (ii) social and economic development \npromoted, with ADB playing an important role in supporting the global agenda of infrastructure \ndevelopment as a source of global growth. The TA will have the following outcome: TTFS included \nas an input in the updating of the Armenia Development Strategy 2014-2025.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output: Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy developed. The TA team will \nassess present and future supply and demand for all modes of transport to identify bottlenecks in \nterms of time, cost, and physical limitations. Correlating the identified deficiencies with current \nand future resources, the project team will develop a system to prioritize future capital expenditure \nprograms that ADB could potentially target for assistance. The TTFS will (i) strengthen the \ngovernment\u2019s role in the transport sector, (ii) support institutional restructuring and strengthening \nof Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure (MTAI), (iii) strengthen public\uf02dprivate \npartnerships, and (iv) introduce systematic investment prioritization mechanisms. The TTFS will \nincorporate best practices in social and environmental safeguard provision, including climate \nchange adaption and mitigation and gender aspects. \n \n10.  The TTFS will comprise the following: \n \n(i)  A Transport Master Plan. The plan will consist of a prioritized set of projects for \nArmenia, and subsectoral policies and plans including for (i) road transport/trucking, \n(ii)  railways,  (iii)  aviation,  (iv)  urban  transport,  (v)  environmental  protection,  \n(vi) social and gender aspects and (vii) private sector involvement. Given the \nimportance of the national highway network in Armenia, the plan will in particular \nprioritize the development of a road sector strategy, with emphasis on road asset \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nmanagement, integration of public private partnerships and performance-based \nmaintenance. \n \n(ii)  Trade facilitation plan. Without sea ports, landlocked countries such as Armenia \nface  higher  trade  costs  for  both  imports  and  exports.  Quality  transport \ninfrastructure and services can mitigate this disadvantage to some extent.7 The \ntrade  facilitation  plan  will  outline  opportunities  and  propose  interventions  for \nArmenia to strengthen regional trade and boost sustainable economic growth. \n \n(iii)  Road safety plan and program. As of 2015, the rate of road traffic fatalities in \nArmenia was 18.3/100,000 population per year (footnote 4), costing the country an \nestimated 1% of its gross domestic product per year. To improve the situation, a \nnational social and gender-inclusive road safety action plan and program is needed \nfor all modes of travel. Such a program should cover all modes of travel, taking \ninto  account  the  gender,  age,  and  other  characteristics  of  road  users.  The \nprogram\u2019s  key  objective  should  be  to  improve  road  safety  through  safety \ncampaigns and by building capacity in accident data collection, black-spot analysis, \nand road safety audit. \n \n(iv)  Modal action plans. TA team will develop 5-year and 10-year action plans for \neach transport mode. The plans will be based on transparent project prioritization \nmatched  with  available  and  future  funding,  incorporating  climate  change \nadaptation and mitigation factors as well as gender considerations. The plans will \nalso propose regulatory and legal improvements and identify responsible agencies.  \n \n11.  To develop the TTFS, the TA team will: \n \n(i)  Prepare transport sector assessment. Identify the needs and deficiencies in the \nsector, with a focus on road transport, and propose means to improve regulatory \nprocess, as well as physical assets. \n \n(ii)  Conduct a trade facilitation assessment. Through this assessment, the TA team \nwill report on the state of affairs in the trade, identify shortcomings and bottlenecks, \nand  propose  solutions  for  improving  physical  transport  infrastructure  and \nstreamlining legal and regulatory processes. \n \n(iii)  Conduct a road safety assessment. The TA team will take stock of ongoing \nefforts by other institutions and international financial institutions to support road \nsafety, identifying strengths and weaknesses in these efforts. \n \n(iv)  Develop a project prioritization tool. Based on clear policy objectives, the TA \nteam will develop a project prioritization mechanism that will use qualitative and \nquantitative indicators to transpose objectives into priorities.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n7  World Economic Forum. 2016.

The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The GoA will provide access to all available information needed for the study effort, commits to \nestablish a multi-stakeholder Steering Committee that will guide study effort. GoA will also provide \nsufficient office space for the consultant team and counterpart staff.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The MTAI will be the executing agency for the TA. The Transport and Communications \nDivision of ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department (CWTC) will administer the TA. The MTAI \nwill set up and will chair a high-level steering committee made up of relevant line ministries, \nimplementation agencies, and transport system users. The tasks of the steering committee will \ninclude (i) being a champion for the development of a shared vision, common principles, and clear \npolicy objectives; (ii) reviewing the consultant terms of reference; (iii) providing overall guidance \nto the consultant team; (iv) making key decisions relating to the preparation of the TTFS; and (v) \nsubmitting the TTFS to the government for endorsement and ratification.   \n \n14.  ADB  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  government  and  the  MTAI.  MTAI  will  invite \ndevelopment  partners  such  as  the  European  Union  and  the  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme  to  participate  in  the  implementation  of  the TA  activities.  ADB  will  support  the \ngovernment in seeking the development partners their endorsement and active contribution to the \noutputs and the upkeep of initiatives taken under this TA. \n \n15.
