INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2009  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for the Study on Beijing Green Finance Development Strategy. A fact-finding \nmission  visited  Beijing  on  20\u201327  April  2010,  and  an  understanding  was  reached  on  the \nobjectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC is the largest carbon dioxide emitting country in the world and has made \ncommitments to reduce its emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 40%\u201345% of 2005 \nlevels by 2020. Addressing this issue is a priority for the government, but reducing emissions \nneeds to be balanced with the requirements of economic development. Development of green \nfinance is one of the ways the government is exploring to achieve this balance.    \n \n3.  Green finance  consists of financial activities  (such  as investments, capital  markets, \nventure capital, insurance, guarantees, asset management, banking, and lending) that support \nenvironmentally  focused  activities  and  industries.  Carbon  finance  is  one  of  the  largest \ncomponents of green finance  and  developing  this sector  will  have  a  major impact  on  the \nreduction of carbon emissions. \n \n4.  Beijing  municipal  government  has  an  ambitious  strategy  to  position  Beijing  as  an \ninternational financial center for green finance, spearheaded by the successful development of \ncarbon finance. International climate change engagements are driven by the government in \nBeijing; Beijing has the additional advantage of being one of the PRC\u2019s major financial centers. \nHence, locating the green finance center in the political center of the PRC will foster synergies \nand interaction between the private sector and the government to encourage rapid progress in \nthe green finance sector. \n \n5.  Beijing municipal government proposes the development of the Beijing  pilot carbon \nfinance district (CFD), which will be a hub for carbon finance and green finance transactions in \nthe PRC. The pilot CFD is to be located in  Beijing\u2019s Dongcheng district, which has been \ndesignated a low-carbon economic zone. The plan also calls for the expansion of the China \nBeijing Environment Exchange (CBEEX) into a major exchange for carbon finance products. \nThe creation of the pilot CFD and a major exchange will promote the growth of environmental \nfinance business. Increased financial transactions and innovations, in turn, will finance activities \nthat will lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n6.  The  TA  will  help  the  PRC  achieve  its  emissions  reduction  target  through  the \ndevelopment of carbon finance. It will conduct a study on the state of carbon finance in the PRC, \nmake recommendations on enabling policies, and create a road map for the establishment of \nthe carbon finance center in Beijing. The results of the TA will form the basis for discussions and \npolicy recommendations to relevant government agencies, such as the National Development \nand Reform Commission, China Banking Regulatory Commission, China Securities Regulatory \nCommission, People\u2019s Bank of China, and the Ministry of Finance. \n \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 April 2010. \n ", "2 \n7.  The PRC country partnership strategy, 2008\u20132010 identified resource efficiency and \nenvironment sustainability as one of four main thrusts, as energy efficiency and emissions \nreduction  are  important  measures  that  lead  to  the  achievement  of  sustainable  economic \ngrowth.2 The TA will play an important role in the achievement of the CPS goals. ADB is ideally \npositioned to provide the TA since it has been working with stakeholders in the PRC to address \npolicy and financial market issues related to carbon finance and environmental finance. In \naddition, its experience with climate change, carbon funds, as well as the Carbon Market \nInitiative, will be instrumental for the smooth execution of the TA. \n \n8.  Risks include (i) the government changing its commitment to emissions reduction, (ii) the \nmarket and participants not having enough capacity to adopt the sophisticated instruments and \nmanage related risks, and (iii) the government not supporting the plan for carbon finance and \nthe establishment of the pilot CFD. \n \n9.  Currently, three environmental exchanges have been set up as pilot schemes\u2014one \neach in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin\u2014to explore the feasibility of emissions trading. The \nCBEEX  was  founded  on  5  August  2008  by  China  Beijing  Equity  Exchange,  New  Energy \nInvestment of China National Offshore Oil Corporation, China Guodian Corporation, and China \nEverbright Investment Management. It was established with the approval of Beijing municipal \ngovernment. The CBEEX, together with BlueNext (Europe\u2019s largest carbon credits exchange) \nand the China Forestry Exchange, recently released the first standard for voluntary greenhouse \ngas offset entitled Panda Standard Version 1.0. The standard for carbon projects aims to \nprovide transparency and credibility to the nascent domestic voluntary carbon market. However, \nthe  concept  of  emissions  trading  is  relatively  new  and  enabling  policies,  regulations,  and \nlegislation need to be developed.    \n \n10.  ADB is working with the CBEEX to develop the PRC\u2019s first voluntary emissions reduction \nstandard, to ensure standard quality for voluntary emissions reduction and trading.3 ADB is \nproviding  TA  focusing  on  project  design  document  development,  validation,  registration, \nverification, and credit issuance. The proposed TA will coordinate efforts to minimize overlap \nand repetition, and encourage cooperation among TA teams. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be its contribution to the establishment of the Beijing pilot CFD \nand the development of the CBEEX as a major carbon market in the PRC. Success will be \nmeasured by the doubling the trading volume in the CBEEX by 2015 as compared to the 2010 \nvolume. The outcome will be a detailed road map for development of the carbon market in the \nPRC and the establishment of the Beijing pilot CFD. The road map will be proposed to key \ngovernment agencies, such as the Ministry of Finance and the National Development and \nReform Commission. Should the proposals be adopted and implemented, the creation of an \nefficient and transparent marketplace for emissions trading and carbon finance in the PRC will \nspur the transition to a low-carbon economy. This will aid in enabling the PRC to achieve its \nemissions reduction goals. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will ascertain the state of carbon finance in the PRC and identify potential areas \nof development. It will then focus on preparing the road map and strategy for the development \nof Beijing into an international center of carbon trading and green finance. One of the TA \noutputs will be policy recommendations to attract and promote the growth of carbon and green \nfinance-related enterprises into the pilot CFD in Beijing. The TA will also address the strategy \nfor the CBEEX to transform into a major carbon trading exchange. \n \n13.  The TA will conduct the following activities: \n(i)  Identify key issues in the development of a carbon market in the PRC, establish the \nBeijing pilot CFD, and formulate a strategy for the CBEEX, preparing three technical \nreports on: \n(a) the current state and potential development of the carbon market in the PRC, \nfocusing on (1) the preparation of an actionable national strategy and road map \nfor the  development  of the voluntary  emissions reduction  market,  and the \ntransition of the carbon market from being project-based to being commodity-\nbased and finally to being financial market-based, (2) the state of the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism market, (3) the development of a joint plan by the \ngovernment and private enterprise market to manage the PRC\u2019s carbon assets, \nand (4) the formulation of policy recommendations to support the growth of a \ncarbon market in the PRC; \n(b) the  development  strategy  for  the  Beijing  pilot  CFD,  focusing  on  (1)  the \nassessment of the state of the finance business sector, (2) a comparative \nanalysis of Beijing and other global finance centers, (3) an actionable road map \nfor the Beijing pilot CFD in the Dongcheng district, and (4) recommendations to \nBeijing municipal government on business-friendly policies to attract relevant \nventures; \n(c) strategic  development  of  the  CBEEX,  including  (1)  a  5-year  plan  for  the \nCBEEX; (2) the design of the voluntary emissions reduction electronic trading \nplatform and trading regulations; (3) the design of trading products, instruments, \nand  pricing  mechanisms;  and  (4)  a  plan  for  cultivating  carbon  market \nparticipants through trade associations and research institutes. \n(ii)  Based on the technical reports, develop recommendations and create knowledge \nproducts in the form of actionable development road map, strategy and policy and \ntechnical  notes  to  the  Beijing  Municipal  Bureau  of  Financial  Work.  The  Beijing \nMunicipal Bureau of Financial Work will use these recommendations and knowledge \nproducts to promote the establishment of the pilot CFD to the Beijing municipal \ngovernment and other policy makers. \n(iii) Develop key stakeholder understanding of the importance of the carbon market in \nthe PRC and establishing the carbon trading center and the CFD through six to eight \nforums and workshops. The TA will conduct \n(a) forums to disseminate the results of the studies and the road map; and \n(b) workshops targeted at relevant government agencies, financial institutions, and \nstakeholders to raise awareness and influence relevant financial policy making \nand  supervisory  personnel  to  (1)  promote  the  establishment  of  a  carbon \nThe views expressfeinda hnecree ins yasrete tmho,s (e2 o) f ethmep choanssiuzleta ntht ean sdi gdnoi fnicoat nnceece ossf atrhiley  rCepFrDes eanntd th tohsee  sotfr AaDteBg\u2019isc  \nmembers, Board oifm Dpiroercttaonrsc,e M oafn athgeem deenvt,e olor psmtaeff,n at nodf  mthaey  bPeR pCre lcimarinbaorny  inm naarktuerte,.  ( 3) advocate the \nestablishment of the CFD in Beijing, and (4) report and disseminate information \nand results obtained from overseas study tours. \n ", "4 \n(iv) Arrange for relevant government personnel to participate in international study tours \nand make  on-site investigations  of overseas carbon markets. These  events  will \nprovide invaluable insights on efforts to establish the CFD. These tours will allow the \nstakeholders to research and investigate the main carbon markets and exchanges in \nAsia, Australia, Europe, and the United States to study the platforms, products, \ncontracts, and innovative financial tools of international carbon trade. Given the \nimportance of these tours to the executing agency and implementing agency, they \nwill be funded entirely through counterpart financing for the TA. Results and key \ninformation  obtained  from  the  study  tours  will  be  presented  and  reported  at \nworkshops organized by the TA.   \n \n14.  Targeted workshops and/or seminars will be organized for different stakeholders at \nvarious stages of project implementation. Materials from such events may be published, if \nwarranted and appropriate, and used for knowledge product dissemination. Seminars will also \nbe held for government officials and private sector stakeholders in relevant fields to gather their \ninputs for the reports.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent. The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will finance \nthe balance of the cost equivalent to $450,000 through provision of office space, counterpart \nstaff,  project  support,  funding  for  international  study  tours,  and  workshops.  Detailed  cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Financial Work will be the executing agency and the \nCBEEX  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  executing  agency  is  a  municipal  agency \nresponsible for the development and promotion of the financial service industry in Beijing. Close \ncollaboration  will  be  needed  among  the  executing  agency  and  implementing  agency.  The \nexecuting  agency  and/or  implementing  agency  will  provide  the  necessary  office  space, \ncounterpart staff, and other services to the consultants; and will arrange meetings for the \nconsultants with relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n17.  The TA is included in the list of delegated TA projects for 2010. The fact-finding mission \nconducted an assessment of technical ability to implement the TA. The capacity assessment \nwas conducted jointly with the Central Operations Services Office to determine the executing \nand implementing agencies capacity to implement TA in the areas of (i) human and physical \nresources,  (ii)  agency  procurement  processes,  (iii)  process  control  and  oversight,  and  (iv) \nrecords keeping. The assessment concluded that, while capacity was satisfactory, given that \nthis is the first TA that will be undertaken by both agencies, it is recommended that EAFM with \nthe  support  of  COSO  would  provide  substantial  support  and  guidance  throughout  the \nimplementation process.  It is recommended that the TA be delegated to the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  based  on  the  \u2015enhanced  partnership\u2016  approach  detailed  in  the \nmemorandum of understanding recently concluded between ADB and the Ministry of Finance. \nThe process and responsibilities of the parties in recruiting consultants under the \u2015enhanced \npartnership\u2016 approach is outlined in Appendix 3.  \n \n ", "    5 \n18.  The  TA  will  engage  a  team  of  consultants  with  expertise  in  carbon  finance, \nenvironmental law, and exchange establishment and operations. Three international consultants \n(total of 8 person-months) and four national consultants (total of 17 person-months) will be \nengaged. The table on allocation of consulting services provides a breakdown by expertise. \nAppendix 4 provides the outline terms of reference for the consultants. The international and \nnational consultants will be selected and engaged either individually or through a firm. If a firm is \nto be used, the preferred selection method for consultants is quality- and cost-based selection \nwith a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Consultant engagement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of \nthe TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). If equipment is to be purchased for use during the TA, it will be \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and \nwill be turned over to the executing agency on completion of the TA. For equipment, training \nseminars, and conferences, an advance payment facility could be used.  \n \nTable: Allocation of Consulting Services \n(person-months) \nExpert  International  National \nCarbon market expert    6 \nCarbon finance expert  3  5 \nEnvironmental and financial laws expert  2  3 \nFinancial expert    3 \nExchange establishment and operation expert   3   \n             Total  8  17 \n \n19.  The TA is expected to be effective in September 2010 and end in September 2012. The \nconsultants will submit to both ADB and the executing agency and the implementing agency (i) \nthe inception report 2 weeks after commencement of services, (ii) interim progress reports at \nappropriate stages during TA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the \ncontract, and (iv) the final report 2 weeks after receiving comments from the executing agency \nand implementing agency and ADB. All reports must be submitted in English and Chinese. \nWorkshops will be organized periodically for the dissemination of the consultants\u2019 findings and \nthe discussion of policy recommendations. \n \n20.  Major project activities will be regularly monitored and reported on by the executing \nagency  or  implementing  agency  and  ADB  review  missions.  Consultants\u2019  reports  will  be \npresented at workshops and seminars organized for the validation of findings. Reports will be \nmade available on ADB websites in English and Chinese and published, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Public Communications Policy (2005, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.
