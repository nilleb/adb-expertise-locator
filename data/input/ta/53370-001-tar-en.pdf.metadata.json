INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  build  on  the  findings, \nrecommendations, and lessons from the TA for Strengthening Developing Member Countries\u2019 \nCapacity in Elderly Care of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), approved in May 2016 and \nexpected to be completed in May 2020, which aims to develop the capacity of developing member \ncountries (DMCs) to adapt to aging populations and develop long-term care (LTC) systems and \nservices.1 The country diagnostic studies conducted under the previous TA in six countries\u2014\nIndonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Viet Nam\u2014revealed large deficits in LTC \nservices, especially those providing affordable and quality care.2 Developing community-based \nservices has emerged as a priority in each country. The TA will (i) continue to build the knowledge \nbase on LTC for older persons; (ii) develop innovative and sustainable community-based LTC \nservice models that can operate in low-income settings, deliver quality and affordable services, \nare sustainable, and have potential for replication; and (iii) strengthen knowledge sharing and \nnetworking on LTC in the region.3 The TA seeks to create new partnerships for service delivery \nand to address the multiple care needs of older persons in Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and \nViet Nam.4 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the management-approved 2019 results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department.5 It is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030, particularly operational priority 1\u2019s agenda of addressing remaining poverty and reducing \ninequalities among the region\u2019s most vulnerable populations.6 The proposed community-based \ncare models will help develop TA and lending portfolios on adapting to aging.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Asia and Pacific region is at the forefront of a profound demographic transition, largely \nbecause of increased longevity and decreased fertility rates. It is currently home to over half of \nthe global population over age 60 years, and this number is expected to rise to nearly two-thirds, \nor close to 1.3 billion, by 2050. The transition is happening at an unprecedented pace, when \ntraditional family support systems are weakening because of factors such as migration and \n \n1  The TA for Strengthening Developing Member Countries\u2019 Capacity in Elderly Care was financed by the Japan Fund \nfor Poverty Reduction ($2.0 million) and the Republic of Korea e-Asia Knowledge Partnership Fund ($500,000). The \nobjectives included undertaking country diagnostic studies to assess policies, programs, services, financing, and \nsystems development in six countries (Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, and Viet Nam); capacity \nbuilding and knowledge sharing among DMCs on developing LTC systems and services, and developing a network \nof specialists and good practice in the region. ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Developing \nMember Countries\u2019 Capacity in Elderly Care. Manila (TA 9111). \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Diagnostic Study (Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Tonga, Viet Nam). Manila. \n3  LTC refers to the activities undertaken by others to ensure that people, who are at risk of or experience significant \ndeclines in capacity, maintain a level of functional ability consistent with their basic rights, fundamental freedoms, \nand human dignity. LTC can be provided in a range of settings, including people\u2019s homes (home care), in the \ncommunity such as in day care centers and community centers (community care), and in residential settings such \nas nursing homes, or care homes. LTC is delivered by a range of people, including family members, health and care \nworkers, and social workers; and by a range of public, private, and voluntary organizations. LTC systems are systems \nto ensure integrated LTC is appropriate, affordable, and accessible. \n4  No-objection letters will be secured before activities are implemented in these countries. \n5  The TA was initially planned as a supplementary to ADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening Developing Members\u2019 Capacity in \nElderly Care, but was converted into a new TA per Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction advice in July 2019. \n6  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila; and ADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Plans for Priority 1: Addressing Remaining Poverty and Reducing \nInequalities. Manila. \n7  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 November 2019. \n ", "2 \nexpanding  female  labor  market  participation. 8  Concurrently,  longevity  and  the  rise  in \nnoncommunicable diseases are leading to increases in multi-morbidities and syndromes such as \ndementia, resulting in complex care cases requiring skilled care, in which there is very little \ncapacity. To date, the majority of care provision is supplied informally by family members, who \nrarely receive any support or training. As population demographics change, there is a need to \ndevelop systems and services to help alleviate the widening gap between demand and supply \nand provide quality services. \n \n4.  LTC can be provided in the home, in the community, or in residential setting, by public, \nnonprofit, or private sector providers. In the capacity-building and planning process under TA \n9111,  DMCs  emphasized  that  the  design  of  LTC  systems  and  services  should  apply \ninternationally recognized concepts such as (i) healthy aging, or the process of developing and \nmaintaining functional ability that enables well-being in older age; (ii) aging in place, which \nemphasizes individuals aging as close to their homes and communities as possible regardless of \nage, income, or ability; and (iii) older person-centered and integrated care, which focuses on \nensuring health and social services work with individuals and their families to coordinate the \nappropriate range of services. \n \n5.  Existing LTC is very limited in types of services, providers, and geographic and beneficiary \ncoverage: services are commonly limited to high-income groups, social welfare services for the \npoorest older persons without family support, and schemes providing care through volunteers. \nThe country diagnostic studies under TA 9111 found that a major challenge across all countries \nis to shift from developing policy to implementing sustainable services on the ground that are \naffordable  and  address  the  particular  contexts  and  strengths  in  each  country.  Developing \ncommunity-based LTC service models in the four selected countries will (i) help expand access \nto the older population, and particularly the poor and vulnerable; (ii) create a clear evidence base \nfor good practice; and (iii) provide an enabling environment for scaling up in the main area of \nservice delivery that each country is prioritizing. \n \n6.  A key barrier to developing LTC systems is lack of financing. Investment to overcome the \nlarge-scale deficit in services will require decisions on (i) public investment from local and national \ngovernments, (ii) appropriate balance between personal and public cost-sharing for LTC, and (iii) \nmobilizing financial resources from different sources. LTC is often categorized as an unaffordable \ncost, while the absence of LTC services risks the inappropriate and avoidable overuse of acute \nhealth care services. Developing low-cost and effective models that can be scaled up and building \na solid evidence base on the impact of investments are important steps to develop LTC systems \nin the region. \n \n7.  ADB has a growing portfolio in LTC and is engaging with DMCs to help them adapt to \npopulation aging and changing social structures. This TA is a timely response to build on policy \ndevelopment in DMCs, translate policy into implementation, share knowledge, and build up the \nevidence base. ADB can help DMCs invest in policies and programs that enable the population \nto age healthily through developing social protection policies, providing LTC services and systems, \nadapting health systems, providing training and education for the health and care workforce, \npromoting lifelong learning and skill adaption, and investing in inclusive environments, including \ninfrastructure,  housing,  and  transport.  Such  investments  will  enable  older  persons  to  fully \n \n8  Gender is an important dimension in LTC. Family carers and employed carers are predominantly women. Women \ngenerally enter their own old age with fewer assets and lower levels of social security. Women tend to live longer \nand  with  longer  periods  of  ill  health,  which  means  they  require  more  care  themselves.  These  cumulative \ndisadvantages over the life course increase their vulnerability in old age. \n ", "3 \nparticipate in society, including in the labor market, and reduce risks for themselves and their \nfamilies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: remaining poverty and inequalities for the \nregion\u2019s most vulnerable population, including older persons, addressed.9 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: capacity of DMCs to develop and scale up community-based care systems \nand services for older persons improved. 10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Knowledge base on long-term care improved. This output will include \nanalysis and small-scale surveys on LTC systems and services in each country. It will include \ntargeted assessments and research addressing topics defined by DMC needs and prioritized in \ncollaboration with ADB regional departments and other partners on the ground, such as access \nto assistive technology, financing schemes for LTC, investments in age-friendly structure, and \nsocial protection for carers, including family members and domestic workers. This output will help \nidentify areas that will effectively address Strategy 2030\u2019s goal of developing an inclusive and \nresilient region with a focus on the older population, including on LTC issues and options in \nsupport of country partnership strategies and country operations business plans.11 The TA can \nmake resources available for new or ongoing small-scale activities in DMCs that provide on-the-\nground support for LTC activities or pipeline development. \n \n10.  Output 2: Capacity building program and community-based care models developed. \nFor this output, the TA will design and develop innovative, affordable, and sustainable community-\nbased LTC service models in rural and urban areas that respond to the demand and care needs \nof older persons and build on the contexts and strengths of existing social and health care services \nin the selected countries (Indonesia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam). Based on the findings \nof the completed country diagnostic studies, and following further consultations with the national \nministries,  local  governments,  nongovernment  organization  service  providers,  and  other \nstakeholders, four priorities were identified: (i) developing integrated health and social care \nservices; (ii) creating care management systems to facilitate integration; (iii) promoting healthy \nand active aging; and (iv) enhancing human resource development of both formal and informal \ncarers. ADB and DMC counterparts will agree on and implement a capacity building framework \ncovering, for example, case management, human resources, and financing. \n \n11.  In Indonesia, model development will take place in three districts in Yogyakarta and will \nfeature  (i)  community-based  services  that  integrate  health  and  social  care  needs  through \ncollaboration between government-run community health clinics (puskesmas) and new and \nexisting community organizations and that will include new services such as dementia care; (ii) \ndeveloping care management systems and capacity; and (iii) capacity building, including training \nfor family members, volunteers, care givers, and health workers. In Mongolia, the community-\nbased care model design will focus on (i) case management and (ii) development of three active \naging centers (at Ulaanbaatar, aimag or provincial level, and soum or district level). Sri Lanka\u2019s \n \n9  Defined by the TA. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11 Studies can focus on sectors such as urban development, health, education, finance, and public sector management. \n ", "4 \nproposed community-based care model will focus on (i) developing an age-friendly primary health \ncare service model, (ii) integrating social care services such as day care through co-location and \ncollaboration  with  community  service  organizations,  and  (iii)  developing  case  management \ncapacity. The project in Viet Nam will focus on (i) establishing an active aging center through \npublic\u2013private partnership, and (ii) strengthening the capacity of its existing community-based \nintergenerational clubs to partner with the health sector and better deliver integrated health and \nsocial care services. The TA will apply technology to enhance productivity, such as simple \nmanagement information system and application-based assessment tools. \n \n12.  The community-based service models will help fill knowledge gaps locally and create \nknowledge and a clear evidence base, which will facilitate dissemination of good practices and \nscaling up within the four countries, and potentially across the region. Capacity building will focus \non  developing training programs  and  operational  manuals  on  care management;  providing \ncompetency training or skills upgrading for family and other informal care givers; and developing \nguidelines and providing training for documentation, monitoring, and evaluation of integrated care \nservices, including cost-benefit analysis and assessment of quality tools. Collaboration with \ncenters of excellence, including in Japan, will focus on topics such as dementia and support \ncapacity building activities for the community-based care models. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge-sharing and networking systems strengthened. This output will \ncontinue to enhance the knowledge-sharing and networking system for knowledge transfer \nestablished under TA 9111. The TA will design and deliver a regional conference on adapting to \naging Asia and will tap Japanese and other experts from ministries of health, labor and welfare; \nuniversities and research institutes; civil society organizations; and private service providers as \nresource speakers. It will disseminate the findings from the care models to support potential \nreplication within and outside of the four countries, including Pacific and East Asian countries, \nthrough a regional conference on community-based care models. Output 3 will (i) also support \nthe design and delivery of an applied learning program (study tour) in Japan for participants from \nthe four countries to learn best practices in developing policies, implementing services, and \ndesigning community-based care; and (ii) provide operational support to regional departments in \ndeveloping the sector and help expand business development and investments for ADB, including \npotential collaboration with Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The estimate covers eligible costs comprising (i) consultant services; (ii) direct cost of TA \nimplementation, including international and local travel, monitoring and reporting, and support for \nknowledge  product  development;  (iii)  workshops,  seminars,  training  sessions,  and  country \nworking group meetings; (iv) regional conferences and forums; (v) applied learning program \nexposure (study tour) in Japan for DMC participants; (vi) small item goods, such as computer \nsoftware packages, exercise machines, and simple medical devices for the care centers; and (vii) \nsurveys. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA with the Social Development Thematic Group (SDTG) as the \nexecuting and implementing agency, through collaboration with the regional department country \n ", "5 \nfocal persons for country-specific activities and other sector and thematic groups. The SDTG \nsecretariat will undertake the overall administrative and coordination role for the TA, including \nengaging and managing the consultants.

ADB will engage consultants following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project administration instructions and \nstaff instructions.12 Overall, the TA will require (i) an estimated 157 person-months of international \nand national consulting services and (ii) inputs from resource persons with expertise related to \npublic  health,  social  work,  medicine,  gerontology,  finance,  project  management  and \nimplementation, communications, and knowledge management. Of the 157 person-months of \nconsulting services, the SDTG as TA Supervising Unit (TASU) will engage two international \nindividual consultants (13 person-months) intermittently, who will work as a team to provide \ntechnical advice on developing integrated community-based care models in the four TA countries. \nTASU will also engage individual national consulting services (estimated at 24 person-months) \nfor  (i)  project  coordination  and  overall  implementation  of  the  TA  and  (ii)  communications, \nknowledge management, and dissemination.

The requirements for each type of expertise and the exact length of consultant \ninputs will vary according to the area and scope of the outputs.  TASU will develop more \ncomprehensive terms of reference accordingly and further clarify deliverables from consultancy \noutputs.  TASU  will  consider  output-based  contracts,  lump-sum  payments,  and  framework \ncontracts for individual consultants as applicable. \n \n18.  Under output 2, ADB will recruit one firm each for Indonesia and Viet Nam, with each firm \nto include a team of one project manager and one project officer who will provide national \nexpertise  to  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  community-based  care  models,  including \nmanagement and administrative, financial, and logistical support. In Mongolia and Sri Lanka, ADB \nwill engage a firm for each country, or, if there is no suitable firm, ADB will select individual \nconsultants. Because local experience on the ground, qualifications of experts, and proven \neffective  engagement  with  local  multistakeholders  are  crucially  important  to  implement \ncommunity-based care models, ADB will use either (i) consultants\u2019 qualification selection for very \nsmall assignments that do not exceed $200,000; or (ii) single-source selection for very small \nassignments that do not exceed $100,000, as provided for in the staff instructions for ADB-\nadministered consulting services. Consultants will be required to submit final reports to ADB and \nthe governments. Evaluation of their performance will be based on the findings of assessments \nby ADB and the governments. \n \n19.  Social media and websites. The existing ADB Adapting to Aging website developed \nunder  the  previous  TA  will  be  updated  and  maintained  for  knowledge  dissemination  and \nnetworking.13 After the TA closes, the website will be maintained under SDTG activities. \n \nIV.
