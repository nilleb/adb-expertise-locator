The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included in its country operations business \nplan 2007\u201320091 for India a loan for the North Eastern Integrated Flood and River Erosion \nManagement Project covering Arunachal Pradesh and Assam. Under the Project Processing \nand Capacity Development technical assistance (TA) cluster, a project preparatory technical \nassistance  (PPTA)  was  completed  for  Arunachal  Pradesh2 on  30  June  2008.  To  ensure \nimplementation readiness, phase 2 of the design of the project and initial capacity building in the \nWater Resources Department (WRD) of Arunachal Pradesh state government (APSG) and local \ncommunities,  will  be  undertaken  under  a  follow-on  PPTA.3 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1, and the initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Flood and River Erosion \u2014 Impacts and Challenges. India\u2019s north eastern region \ncovers 26.2 million hectares, with a population of over 40 million. About 75% of the region\u2019s \ngeographical area, including 97% of Arunachal Pradesh, is located in the Brahmaputra River4 \nbasin\u2014one of the most flood-prone parts of the world. The most significant problems and the \ncauses of flooding and river erosion are (i) the runoff from extremely heavy rainfall during the \nmonsoon; and (ii) high sediment loads from upper watersheds, which are geologically young \nand unstable, and susceptible to landslides and earthquakes. Watershed degradation caused \nby unsustainable shifting cultivation and deforestation is also widespread. Recurring flooding \nand river erosion affect large segments of the population, degrade the limited productive land \nand the environment,5 and act as a disincentive for long-term investment in the state. As a result, \neconomic growth is slowing down and the incidence of poverty is increasing, as marginal groups \ndescend into poverty because of losses related to floods and river erosion. Arunachal Pradesh \nhas high social and cultural diversity, with over 64% of its population of 1.2 million belonging to \nscheduled tribes. Although the state has immense potential for development of hydropower, \ntourism, and other natural resource-based industries, it remains largely untapped. Its per capita \nincome is 85% of the national average and the poverty incidence (33.5%) is higher than the \nnational level (27%).6 \n3.  Policy Initiatives. A comprehensive policy framework for flood control has been in place \nsince 1954, and has promoted short- to long-term programs for both structural and nonstructural \nmeasures. Recognizing the vast impact of floods and river erosion on the national economy, the \nNational Water Policy7 emphasizes the need for integrated basin-based master planning for \nflood control and management; increased implementation of nonstructural measures such as \nflood forecasting and warning, flood plain zoning, and flood proofing to minimize flood-related \nlosses and to reduce recurring expenditure on flood relief; and modernization and extension of \nthe existing flood forecasting and flood warning systems. In 2004, the Government established \na Task Force for Flood Management to implement these principles of the national water policy. \nThe Government\u2019s 11th Five\u2013Year Plan8 places high priority on protecting flood-prone areas and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

About 42% of its catchment \narea in India is covered by Arunachal Pradesh and 36% by Assam.  \n5   Annual reported damage between 1998 and 2004 amounted to $55 million. \n6   Government of India. 10th Five\u2013Year Plan (2002\u20132007).

Delhi. \n ", "2   \nhas projected expenditures of $720 million equivalent for flood control. It also acknowledges the \nimpact of global warming, as it is expected that floods will become more intense and frequent. \nTo date, 16 million hectares of riverine land have been protected with flood embankments and \nother structures. A nationwide flood forecasting and warning system has also been set up.  \n4.  In Arunachal Pradesh, efforts to address the problems were initiated by WRD, and have \nfocused on structural works in critical locations to protect towns and productive agriculture land. \nSo far, 40 schemes (including 19 town protection works) have been implemented, benefiting \n54,000  ha.  Nonstructural  measures  are  yet  to  be  implemented  in  Arunachal  Pradesh. \nWatershed management efforts are under way, but there is little integration with integrated flood \nand river erosion management (IFREM) programs. More effective management systems for \nplanning,  implementation,  monitoring,  and  maintenance  are  required\u2014based  on  a  firm \nunderstanding of the dynamic river processes, with build-in flexibility for timely and adequate \nresponses.  Substantial  opportunities  exist  to  enhance  cost-effectiveness  through  improved \nplanning, low-cost designs, and high implementation efficiency and transparency.  \n5.  Based on initial progress, APSG intends to develop a comprehensive framework and \nprograms  for  IFREM,  following  relevant  national  policies  and  recommendations.  The  main \nrecommendations envisage (i) developing integrated and sub-basin IFREM plans, incorporating \ncatchment management; (ii) constructing strategic structural measures in the critical areas of \neconomic activity; (iii) introducing nonstructural measures including flood forecasting, warning \nsystems,  and  flood  zoning;  (iv)  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  WRD;  and                      \n(v) developing affected communities\u2019 capacity to understand and address the risk environment \nbetter, based on their tribal traditional and indigenous coping mechanisms. In line with this \ninitiative,  APSG  enacted  the  Water  Resources  Management  Authority  Act,  2006,  which \nproposed the establishment of (i) a ministerial level state water council; (ii) a secretary level \nstate  water  board,  for  which  the  chief  engineer  acts  as  secretary;  and  (iii)  a  state  water \nmanagement authority. However, implementation of the act has been slow in terms of setting up \na state water council and state water board, and thus preparing the integrated water plan. \n6.  WRD is a key organization within APSG to support an IFREM framework and programs. \nWhile it has strong leadership and engineering skills to implement IFREM infrastructure works, \nits institutional functions, structure, resources, and management systems need to be upgraded \nto support an IFREM approach. This should be addressed by (i) supporting APSG to develop a \nstate water resources policy and implement the provisions of the 2006 act\u2014making the state \nwater council and state water board operational; (ii) strengthening IFREM management systems, \nincluding the data and knowledge base and infrastructure maintenance, within the institutional \nframework; (iii) defining the specific roles of WRD and functional arrangements for IFREM; (iv) \nintegrating  community  participation  in  IFREM  operations;  and  (v)  strengthening  social  and \nenvironmental safeguards management. Likewise, effective collaboration arrangements for a \nholistic IFREM approach, integrated with catchment management, should be defined\u2014building \non the existing setup of emergency disaster management and in line with emerging institutional \narrangements  for integrated water resources management. \n7.  ADB Support. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for India (2008\u20132012)9 recognizes the \nrole  of  the  water  sector  in  promoting  equitable  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and \nenvironmental  sustainability.  It  also  focuses  on  enhancing  intra  and  inter-sectoral  water \nresources management, and reducing flood and river erosion damage in states in the north \neastern region through comprehensive risk management. ADB\u2019s Water Policy10 emphasizes \ndeveloping  state  water  policies,  supporting  water  management  institutions,  promoting \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2008.

WRD has initiated efforts to address flood and river erosion, focused on structural \nworks in critical locations\u2014towns and productive agriculture lands. However, nonstructural flood \nand river erosion measures and watershed management have yet to be implemented in state-\nwide IFREM programs. Key challenges facing the development and successful implementation \nof  an  IFREM  strategy  in  Arunachal  Pradesh  are  inadequate  funding,  low  technical  and \nmanagement  capacity  within  WRD,  and  limited  cooperation  between  state  and  central \ngovernment organizations. \n8.  Against this backdrop, APSG submitted a project proposal to establish and implement a \ncomprehensive IFREM framework and programs at the state level for possible ADB financing. It \nincludes a prioritized list of short-term IFREM infrastructure; a range of nonstructural IFREM \nmeasures;  and  associated  strengthening  of  policy,  planning,  and  institutional  capacity.  A \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  proposal\u2014including  a  sector  policy  and  institutional \ndevelopment road map, feasibility and safeguard assessments of five subprojects, institutional \nsetup  and  implementation  arrangements,  and  an  investment  program\u2014has  been  prepared \nunder the completed TA for possible ADB funding through the MFF modality. Building on this \nproposal, the follow-on PPTA will assist in strengthening the capacity of WRD and participating \ncommunities, and enhancing the investment project readiness in line with the project readiness \ncriteria agreed between the Government and ADB. The PPTA will (i) undertake preliminary \ncapacity building within WRD (with up to 15 technical staff being trained) and local communities \nto ensure institutional readiness to implement the investment program; (ii) refine the proposed \ninvestment program based on a clear strategic context outlined in the country partnership \nstrategy, and prepare a framework financing agreement (FFA); (iii) prepare detailed engineering \ndesigns, contract packages, and procurement documents and arrangements for structural and \nnonstructural subprojects to be implemented under project 1 of the program (tranche 1 of the \nMFF); and (iv) prepare the first periodic financing request (PFR) relating to project 1.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The completed TA prepared an investment program to enhance IFREM in Arunachal \nPradesh  through  (i)  strengthened  institutional  capacity  for  IFREM  in  WRD  and  local \ncommunities  in  flood-prone  areas;  and  (ii)  comprehensive,  cost-effective,  sustainable,  and \nadaptive structural and nonstructural measures for IFREM. The impact of the follow-up PPTA \nwill be effective implementation of the investment program. The outcome will be improved \nreadiness to implement and manage the MFF investment program. \n10.  Outputs of the PPTA will comprise:  \n(i)  an improved IFREM policy and regulatory framework;  \n(ii)  a refined strategic context, development road map, and investment program;  \n(iii)  a capacity development plan for WRD;  \n(iv)  WRD staff trained in key IFREM activities (including structural and nonstructural \nmeasures),  and  ADB  project  implementation  and  financial  management \nprocedures to facilitate effective investment program start-up;  \n(v)  frameworks for community participation in IFREM; and for social, resettlement, \nindigenous peoples, and environmental safeguards;  \n(vi)  detailed  plans  for  community  participation,  social  development  and  livelihoods \nenhancement, resettlement, and environmental protection in the areas of the five \nsubprojects selected for implementation under project 1 of the investment program;  \n(vii)  pilot community-based flood management and livelihood enhancement initiatives;  \n ", "4   \n(viii)  preselection  of  sample  watershed  areas  for  IFREM  activities,  including  initial \nsocioeconomic assessment, stakeholder consultation, and information campaigns;  \n(ix)  detailed engineering designs, drawings, specifications, procurement procedures, \nand bidding and contract documents for the five subprojects under project 1;11  \n(x)  detailed  designs  for  nonstructural  IFREM  measures  and  a  program  for \nimplementation of nonstructural measures under the investment program; and  \n(xi)  a project FFA and the first PFR relating to project 1 (tranche 1). \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  International and national consultants will be engaged to implement the PPTA. In close \ncollaboration with WRD and related APSG agencies, the consultants will (i) enhance the policy, \nregulatory, and institutional environment for effective IFREM; and refine the IFREM road map \nand strategy; (ii) strengthen the capacity of WRD and local communities to increase their \nreadiness to implement and participate effectively in the project; (iii) refine the investment \nprogram  and  all  documents  required  to  expedite  loan  processing  within  ADB;  (iv)  finalize \nengineering  designs  and  contract  and  bidding  documentation;  and  (v)  provide  detailed \nproposals  and  designs  for  IFREM  nonstructural  measures.  A  highly  participatory  and \nconsultative  approach  will  be  followed  in  all  PPTA  activities.  Relevant  lessons  from  ADB \noperations experiences of other international organizations, and best international practices will \nbe incorporated in the outputs of the PPTA.12 The activities are grouped into two components. \n1.  Part A: Enabling Environment \n12.  This component will support establishing an enabling policy, regulatory, and institutional \nenvironment for IFREM. Key activities comprise (i) support to APSG to update and refine the \nstate water policy, framework, strategies, IFREM strategy, and sector road map; (ii) support for \nestablishing the state water council and state water board; (iii) design and implementation of \npublic awareness and consultation campaigns; (iv) immediate strengthening of WRD\u2019s capacity \nto  implement  the  project,  and  preparation  of  a  long-term  capacity  development  plan; \n(v) establishing guidelines and mechanisms for effective community participation in IFREM, \nincluding detailed procedures for community participation in the planning and implementation of \nflood and river erosion measures; and (vi) developing frameworks, schedules, and capacity \nbuilding programs for resettlement, social, and environmental assessment and monitoring.  \n2.  Part B: Implementation Readiness \n13.  This component is aimed at enhancing the readiness and implementation arrangements \nof  the  investment  program.  It  will  refine  the  MFF  investment  program  design,  costs  and \nfinancing, benefits and justification, safeguard frameworks, social and gender action plans, and \nimplementation  arrangements.  It  will  prepare  detailed  designs,  contract  packaging,  bidding \ndocuments, and advance actions for procurement (acceptable to ADB) for community works \ncontracts.  It  will  develop  structural  and  nonstructural  works  contracts  that  follow  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) for subprojects selected for \nimplementation under project 1. The subproject selection criteria and procedures for structural \n                                                 \n11 Detailed  engineering  designs  will  be  financed  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility. \n12 The following relevant studies were provided by ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department and are available at \nhttp://evis.asiandevbank.org/: ADB. 2007.

To reflect the \nimportance attached to community participation in the project, detailed plans will be developed \nfor community-based IFREM, risk management, and community-based watershed conservation \nand mitigation strategies.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,130,000 equivalent. It will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program ($150,000) and the Multi-Donor \nTrust Fund13 under the Water Financing Partnership Facility ($750,000) and administered by \nADB. APSG will finance the remaining $230,000 equivalent through provision of office space, \ncounterpart staff, surveys, and data collection and analysis. Specific cost estimates and a \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nPPTA does not commit ADB to finance the proposed investment program. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Arunachal Pradesh Water Resources Department will be the Executing Agency for \nthe PPTA and will appoint a PPTA director at the level of senior superintending engineer. APSG \nhas established a secretary-level PPTA steering committee chaired by the chief secretary to \nguide preparation of the project.14 The PPTA will also seek the advice of relevant government \nagencies at key stages of PPTA implementation.15 ADB, through regular missions and the India \nResident Mission, will monitor the PPTA to support timely implementation. \n16.  The  PPTA  will  be  implemented  over  9  months  from  October  2008  to  June  2009, \nincluding a break in the implementation schedule of 3 months to coincide with the peak flooding \nseason when field activities are constrained by limited access to subproject sites. The break in \nimplementation will provide time for the Government, APSG, and other agencies to review and \nconsult on key draft policy, regulatory, and strategy documents prepared by the PPTA. \n17.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  for  a  total  of  50  person-months,  comprising \n16 person-months of international consultants, and 34 person-months of national consultants. \nThe outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The team will be engaged as \nindividual consultants by ADB to obtain consultants with the most appropriate qualifications and \nexperience for the unique conditions in the area. All consultants will be recruited following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant \nteam  will  submit  to  the  Government,  APSG,  and  ADB  quarterly  progress  reports  detailing \nactivities undertaken and overall progress. In addition to progress reports, the consultants will \nsubmit the specific reports and documents identified in Appendix 4. Procurement of equipment \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Multi-Donor Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership \nFacility, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $150,000 on a grant \nbasis  to  the  Government  of  India  for  preparing  the  Integrated  Flood  and  River  Erosion \nManagement Project \u2013 Arunachal Pradesh, and hereby reports these actions to the Board. \n                                                 \n13  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, and Norway. \n14  Including planning, finance, disaster management, land, rural development, forestry, and agriculture.  \n15  Including the Ministry of Water Resources, Central Water Commission, Brahmaputra Board, and the Ministry of \nDevelopment of North Eastern Region. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or \nDesign Summary \nIndicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions  \nEnhanced economic growth  \u2022 Reduced flood and river  \u2022 State and district statistics  \u2022 Government of India \nand population incomes  erosion damages and  on agriculture, incomes,  (Government) and APSG \nbecause of reduced  poverty incidence to project  and human development  support the proposed \nvulnerability to flood and river  areas (to be quantified by  index  policy, regulatory, and \nerosion, and loss of land in  the technical assistance)  institutional reforms \n\u2022 Arunachal Pradesh state \nArunachal Pradesh  \n\u2022 Long-term institutional  government (APSG)  \u2022 Government, APSG, and \n \nstrategy for effective  consultation papers and  Asian Development Bank \nintegrated flood and river  reports  (ADB) agree on the terms \nerosion management  and conditions of the loan \n\u2022 APSG statistical yearbooks \n(IFREM) adopted   agreement for the \n\u2022 United Nations  Integrated Flood and River \n\u2022 Sound arrangements \nDevelopment Programme  Erosion Management \nestablished for participatory \nHuman Development  Project (IFREMP) \nIFREM planning, \nReport for Arunachal \nimplementation, and \nPradesh  \u2022 Government and APSG \noperation and maintenance  \nprovide required \n\u2022 Budget monitoring and \n\u2022 Actions taken to sustain   counterpart funding for \nevaluation reports \noperation and maintenance   IFREMP \nfunding of IFREM \ninfrastructure      \u2022 Communities willing to \nparticipate in IFREMP \nactivities \nRisk \n\u2022 Natural disasters beyond \nthe design flood return \nperiod \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved institutional capacity  \u2022 Arunachal Pradesh Water  \u2022 Project preparatory  \u2022 WRD staff receptive to \nand readiness to implement,  Resources Department  technical assistance (PPTA)  training and revised IFREM-\nmanage, and sustain the  (WRD) staff trained in  consultants' reports  related functions \nIFREMP  technical IFREM activities \nand ADB project  \u2022 Consultations with relevant  \u2022 Communities receptive to \nimplementation procedures  water and risk management  IFREM awareness and \norganizations  capacity building and pilot \n\u2022 Enhanced IFREM  initiatives \n\u2022 Capacity building training \nawareness and commitment \nand workshop evaluation \nto IFREMP implementation  \u2022 PPTA counterpart funding \nreports \nin communities located in  and facilities provided on \nsubproject areas identified  \u2022 Relevant reports of the  schedule \nunder project 1 of the  Assam IFREMP   \nIFREMP  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe \nhow the project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty \nreduction strategy of the partner country. \nWhile the process of development in Arunachal Pradesh is recent, the state of development is encouraging. \nIncome per head has increased and the rate of growth of income is high compared to the national average. The \nliteracy rate has increased from 25% in 1981 to 54% in 2001. The health status has also improved. Nevertheless, \noverall, the north eastern region has a higher incidence of poverty. The human poverty indexa for Arunachal \nPradesh is estimated at 39% compared to the national human poverty index of 33%. According to the 2001 \ncensus, the scheduled tribes\u2019 population constitutes about 65% of the total population of 1,098,000 people; the \nremainder belongs to the general category. Arunachal Pradesh is also characterized by linguistic diversity, with \n42 languages being spoken. The people have an innate knowledge of the environment passed down from \ngeneration to generation, and have helped to protect the rich biodiversity of the state. Social cohesion and a strong \nsense of community spirit persist. \nOver 90% of Arunachal Pradesh consists of mountainous and hilly terrain cut by narrow tributary river valleys. A \nthird of the net state domestic product comes from the primary sector\u2014agriculture. Except for a few tribes with \nland in river valleys where paddy cultivation is done on mostly rain-fed terraced land during the monsoon season, \nmost agricultural production is based on shifting cultivation (or jhumming) for subsistence purposes only. The \nstate\u2019s  strategy  for  economic  growth  emphasizes  improved  intrastate  and  interstate  connectivity,  rural  and \nagricultural growth, social development, and hydropower and tourism development, while preserving the social \nintegrity and culture of the tribal population.  \nEffective integrated flood and river erosion management (IFREM) is essential in the state\u2019s scarce plain areas, \nwhere productive agricultural land and urban and township areas are located. Causes of significant flooding and \nriver erosion are the runoff from extremely heavy rainfalls during monsoon, which may coincide with floods in the \nmain rivers and high loads of silt from the upper watersheds in the Himalayas, where the Brahmaputra River \noriginates. Sudden breaching of temporary dams formed by landslides in the upper reaches of the tributaries also \ncontributes  to  sudden  devastating  flash  floods.  There  is  no  operational  flood  warning  system.  Watershed \ndegradation caused by shortening cycles and reduced fallow periods in shifting cultivation and deforestation is \nwidespread. The national water policyb emphasized nonstructural measures, and incorporated an integrated \napproach with basin-wide watershed management and stakeholder participation. \nThe economic costs and social disruption associated with flooding have been rising. This is partly due to \nincreasing human occupation and associated economic activity in the scarce floodplains. In-migration into the state \nis indicated by a rising \u201cgeneral\u201d population compared with the tribal population, settling in the risky flood plains for \nagricultural production purposes much in the same way as they do in the floodplains of the Brahmaputra and on \nchar (sandbar) islands. The inflow of migrant labor has led to the introduction of new technology in agriculture. \nMigrant workers have brought the knowledge of wet rice cultivation, and this meant the extension of permanent \ncultivation in many river valleys and plateaus. Only a few tribes\u2014such as the Apatani, Kamptis, and Singpho of \nLohit  district\u2014practice  permanent  cultivation  or  cultivated  paddy  on  terraced  land  as  opposed  to  shifting \ncultivation. It is believed that these migrant workers are an important segment of the agricultural labor force \nextending the permanent cultivation of land that used to be uncultivated. \nB.     Targeting Classification \n1. Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);   Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs \n2. Explain the basis for the targeting classification: The project is located in one of the poorest states in India. \nArunachal Pradesh per capita income is 85% of the national average and poverty incidence (33.5%) is higher than \nthe national level (27%).c \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed? Not \napplicable. \n \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)/due diligence?  \nBesides river erosion control structures, the project will develop (i) frameworks for community participation in \nIFREM, and for social, resettlement, indigenous peoples, and environmental safeguards; (ii) detailed plans for \ncommunity  participation,  social  development  and  livelihoods  enhancement,  resettlement,  and  environmental \nprotection in the areas of the five subprojects selected for implementation under project 1 of the investment \nprogram (tranche 1 of the multitranche financing facility [MFF]); and (iii) pilot community-based flood management \nand livelihood enhancement initiatives. Therefore, participatory social and economic analysis is required to analyze \nstrategies to meet the development needs and priorities of the tribal population and other segments of society. As \nArunachal Pradesh is a special category state, the role of development processes and the involvement of the \nGovernment and local community participation practices will be pursued to determine sensitive, nondisruptive, \nsocial, and culturally sensitive implementation modalities. \nKey questions of the development process in Arunachal Pradesh remain land tenure and land ownership of the \ntribal population, and the changing pattern in the gender division of labor. This will be further assessed in the \ncontext of the technical assistance and the ensuing project. While the challenge for the tribal population will be \nland titling under a communal land holding system, the challenge for women and particularly tribal women will be to \nsecure land ownership. A social analysis already under preparation will also examine the communal landholding \nstructure and to what extent the proposed investment program will affect traditional landholding patterns. Most \nstructural activities will be undertaken on rivers that are regarded as communal land, where access is guided by \nusufruct rights. In this context, community-based approaches will be given priority. \n3. If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? Please see item 2 above. \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1. Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? The major beneficiaries are the poor tribal communities located at the rapidly eroding and \nfrequently flooded riverbanks, where limited agricultural land is available for cultivation.  \n2. What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? Social surveys indicated that \nimproved flood and river erosion security will have positive impacts on farming activities and farm incomes. Limited \naccess to markets and health facilities were identified as other key issues.  \n3. What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? The project will reduce flooding and river erosion, and will protect private assets and public \ninfrastructure. However, in the past limited community participation, lack of transparency in subproject planning, \npoor construction quality of protection structures were the key limiting factors to fully access the benefits of projects \nimplemented  by  the  Water  Resources  Department.  The  proposed  project  will  ensure  full  participation  of \nbeneficiaries  and  local  communities  in  the  entire  project  cycle\u2014planning,  design,  implementation,  and \nmaintenance. The project participation strategy will involve (i) project-specific institutional and implementation \narrangements aiming at close guidance and supervision of the project consultative approach by a multidisciplinary \nproject management team and specialized nongovernment organizations; (ii) awareness campaigns and capacity \nstrengthening programs targeting key stakeholders; (iii) specific actions aimed to empower the participating \ncommunities and vulnerable groups and raise their living standards; and (iv) community-based income-generating \nactivities linked to watershed rehabilitation and management. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \u2013 Key stakeholders are the tribal rural communities and the urban \npoor located in the flood-prone areas. \n2.  What  type  of  consultation  and  participation  (C&P)  is  required  during  the  PPTA  or  project  processing \n(e.g., workshops, community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations, and community-based \norganizations, etc.)? The follow-up technical assistance (PPTA) will complete the stakeholder analysis undertaken \nduring the component technical assistance and refine the community participation strategy based on the realities \nand the special development needs of Arunachal Pradesh \u2014 considering the state\u2019s special political and economic \nsituation and the rights of the tribal population to land and participation in project activities. \nThrough the active participation of community groups, drawing on strong community spirit, ownership of and \nsupport for IFREM and the investment program will be strong. How to best involve community action in flood and \nerosion control for structural and nonstructural measures will be refined, taking into account that structural \nmeasures  (such  as  river  embankments,  revetments,  and  spurs)  require  regular  maintenance  and  need \ncomplementary nonstructural measures to be made more effective. Under the technical assistance, detailed plans \nwill be developed for community participation, social development, livelihood enhancement, resettlement, and \nenvironmental protection in the areas of the five subprojects selected for implementation under project 1 of the \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \ninvestment program. Since most of the community groups were never exposed to the development process and \nhave no experience with working together for development projects, it is proposed to pilot test community-based \nflood management and livelihood enhancement initiatives in micro watersheds under this technical assistance to \nbe scaled up under the follow-on loan. \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No     \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nThe challenge for women and particularly tribal women in the development process will be to secure land \nownership. A result of increasing population density and intensification of agriculture is that shifting cultivation \nsystems with collective ownership over land are usually transformed into a system of peasant production of private \nlandownership using animals for land cultivation and transport. These changes may have significant impact on the \nposition of women, as private landownership may lead to the transfer of land to males and marginalization of \nwomen in production activities which in turn leads to their marginalization in society and the household. Although \nthere is no matriarchy in Arunachal Pradesh, women hold a high and respectable position. They work on equal \nterms with the men in jhumming and make their influence felt in the tribal councils. \n2.  Does  the  proposed  project/program  have  the  potential  to  promote  gender  equality  and/or  women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and \nparticipation in decision making?    Yes      No   Please explain.  \nYes, a gender action plan has been prepared under the component technical assistance and will be further refined \nduring the follow-up PPTA. The PPTA will refine the gender action plan to ensure that women, particularly tribal \nwomen will participate and equally benefit from investment program activities. It will also analyze the changes in \nthe communal land holding structure and to what extent the investment program will affect traditional land holding \npatterns. The pilot community-based flood management, and livelihood enhancement initiatives will be based on \nmicro-watershed  since developing and managing the natural resource base works best when associated with  \nlivelihood activities and time saving techniques for women that improve income and reduce their daily drudgeries, \nSuch initiatives have been successfully tested in the context of the hill tribal cultures of the Himalayas.d \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality?    \n          Yes          No \nIII.

Nonstructural Measures \n8.  The consultants will provide detailed designs for IFREM nonstructural measures based \non proposals made during the PPTA phase 1, to be implemented under the project, including \n(i) flood forecasting and warning mechanisms for selected catchments, including a network of \nrainfall gauges; (ii) pilot flood emergency planning and management (prevention, preparedness, \nresponse, and recovery) starting with the selected catchments; (iii) community-based flood risk \nmanagement; and (iv) flood education models suitable for different sociocultural (tribal) areas \nand  flood  and  river  erosion  problems.  The  scope  for  developing  and  implementing  other \nnonstructural measures (land-use zoning, building and development planning, and financial \nmeasures such as flood insurance) under the project needs to be examined in detail, given their \npotential implications for other state and national policies, regulations, and institutions. The \nPPTA  consultants  will  also  initiate  policy  dialogue  with  APSG  in  relation  to  the  efficient \nimplementation and operationalization of the proposed structural nonstructural measures.  \nd.  Integrated Community-Based Management \n9.  To  reflect  the  importance  attached  to  community  participation  in  the  project,  the \nconsultants will prepare detailed plans for integrated community-based management in relation \nto flood and river erosion, including (i) defining the risk environment, (ii) developing community-\nbased structural and nonstructural mitigation strategies, (iii) community watershed conservation \nactivities,  and  (iv)  guidelines  for  community-based  planning  and  implementation  and \nmaintenance. \nC.
