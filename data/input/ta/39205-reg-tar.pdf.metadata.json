In  December  2004,  the  International  Organization  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions \n(INTOSAI), through Riksrevisionen (the Swedish National Audit Office [SNAO], chair of the \nWorking Group on Financial Audit Guidelines [WG]), presented to ADB a proposal for technical \nassistance  for  the  preparation  of  financial  audit  guidelines,1  based  on  the  International \nStandards of Audit (ISA).2 The guidelines will be made available to all member supreme audit \ninstitutions (SAIs) to assist them in planning and conducting the financial audit of public sector \ninstitutions.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  SNAO  has  been  named  WG  chair  by  the  Auditing  Standards  Committee  (ASC)  of \nINTOSAI.4  INTOSAI  fosters  the  exchange  of  ideas,  knowledge,  and  experiences  among \nmember SAIs, and promotes and supports their continuous improvement. INTOSAI promotes \ngood governance by enabling member SAIs to help their governments govern more capably \nand with greater transparency, be accountable, stay credible, fight corruption, keep the public\u2019s \ntrust, and efficiently receive and use public resources for the benefit of their citizens. \n \n3.  Much of INTOSAI\u2019s work is done by committees and working groups, whose formation \nand composition take into consideration the various auditing systems and the need for regional \nrepresentation. The success of these committees and working groups depends on consistent \nprofessional and financial support from member SAIs. However, for large projects, such as the \npreparation of the financial audit guidelines, external finance is sought to pay for outright cash \nexpenditures. \n \n4.  INTOSAI obtains policy guidance at the highest level from the Lima Declaration (October \n1977), which called for independence in government auditing. The Declaration is seen as the \nfirst level in the hierarchy of standards for public sector auditing. However, it is broadly stated, \nand gives little guidance on how the obligations it lays down should be fulfilled.  \n \n5.  The ASC of INTOSAI (to be subsumed under the Professional Standards Committee by \nSeptember 2005) was therefore created in 1984 to develop auditing standards for the public \nsector. By 1998, INTOSAI had issued a  Code of Ethics, based on the principles of integrity, \nindependence, objectivity and impartiality, professional secrecy, and competence (the second \nlevel of standards), as well as its Auditing Standards (third level). The INTOSAI standards are \nslightly more detailed with respect to the basic principles, general standards, ethical standards, \nfield standards (planning, supervision and review, study and evaluation of internal controls, \ncompliance with laws and regulations, audit evidence, and analysis of financial statements), and \nreporting standards in government auditing. In 2004, the 18th INTOSAI Congress approved the \nImplementation Guidelines for Performance Audit.5  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in July 2005. \n2  Promulgated by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) of the International Federation \nof Accountants (IFAC). \n3  A RETA fact-finding mission was fielded on 25\u201326 February 2005. \n4  With the adoption of the INTOSAI strategic plan, the Auditing Standards Committee will be replaced in September \n2005 by the Professional Standards Committee.. \n5  The Code of Ethics, the INTOSAI Auditing Standards, and the Implementation Guidelines for Performance Audit \nwere delivered by the ASC, with Sweden as chair and SNAO as project secretariat. \n ", "2   \n6.  Since  the  1998  INTOSAI  Congress,  SAIs  have  called  repeatedly  for  more  detailed \nguidance. In 1998, the ASC was assigned to respond to the need for financial audit guidelines. \nIt  was  also  instructed to  closely  follow  the  development  of  the  International  Federation  of \nAccountants (IFAC) and the promulgation of ISA by the International Auditing and Assurance \nStandards Board (IAASB). In 2002, the IAASB and INTOSAI (through the ASC) agreed to \ncollaborate on the promulgation of ISA and the preparation of financial audit guidelines (for \npublic sector auditors). The WG, comprising Austria, Canada, Cameroon, Namibia, Norway, UK, \nUS, Tunisia, and Sweden (chair), was established. As Sweden chairs the WG, SNAO serves as \nthe WG secretariat and has assigned several staff members to this function. \n \n7.  The Financial Audit Guidelines, once completed, will form the fourth level of standards \nfor  public  sector  auditing  and  will  give  in-depth  guidance  on  how  the  INTOSAI  Auditing \nStandards are to be implemented. While international auditing standards must  reflect the public \nsector  perspective,  it has  been  recognized  that  there  is  little  to  be  gained  by  having  two \ncompletely different sets of auditing standards for private sector entities and public sector \nentities.  It  is  also  recognized  that  both  standards  and  guidance  must  allow  the  voice  of \ndeveloping countries to be heard. The Financial Audit Guidelines will therefore be developed \naround the ISA and will include a general introduction and background information, general \nconsiderations common to all public sector audits, a comparison between the INTOSAI Auditing \nStandards and the ISA, and specific practice notes (one for each ISA). With the support of ADB \nand other multilateral development banks (MDBs), experts from developing countries will be \nable to participate in developing standards and to represent the special needs of developing \ncountries in drawing up implementation guidelines. \n \n8.  The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness commits donor support for the development \nefforts of developing member countries (DMCs) by aligning aid with the DMC development \nagenda  and  using  country  systems  and  procedures  to  the  utmost.6    The  Financial  Audit \nGuidelines, addressed specifically to public sector auditing requirements and developed with the \nhelp of experts from DMCs, will be important for developing the capacity of DMC supreme audit \ninstitutions, which now have limited capacity to comply with international auditing standards. \nHaving effective supreme audit institutions will, in turn, make donors more willing to rely on \ncountry systems. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  goal  of  the  proposed  project  is  to  promote  good  governance  through  more \ntransparent  and  accountable  public  sector  management.  The  Project  will  support  the \ndevelopment and dissemination of financial audit guidelines based on the international auditing \nand assurance standards issued by the IAASB. It will achieve this objective through (i) the \nactive  participation  of  INTOSAI  experts  from  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  in \npromulgating auditing standards; and (ii) the development and dissemination of financial audit \nguidelines that consider the needs of the DMCs. \n \n                                                 \n6  High Level Forum. 2005.

The promulgation of international standards is a complex task and must be as inclusive \nas possible. The INTOSAI Financial Audit Guidelines will be developed primarily by experts \nfrom INTOSAI member states.7 To fulfill its obligation to collaborate with the IAASB and to \ndevelop the Financial Audit Guidelines, the WG has established the Reference Panel of experts \nfrom  INTOSAI\u2019s  member  organizations.  Some  experts  will  participate  actively  in  IAASB  or \nPractice Note task forces or both; others will provide support without attending the meetings of \nthe  task  forces.  As  of  February  2005,  98  experts  representing  58  countries  were  in  the \nReference Panel.8  \n \n11.  The IAASB has issued 36 international auditing standards covering general principles \nand responsibilities; risk assessment and response to assessed risk; audit evidence; use of the \nwork of others; audit conclusions and reporting; and specialized areas. At the start of 2004, \nINTOSAI,  through  the  WG,  was  represented  on  various  IAASB  task  forces  preparing  or \nreviewing ISA. Seven ISA have been promulgated, with the participation of INTOSAI, and an \nadditional 16 ISA are expected to be revised or developed over the next 3 years, also with its \nparticipation. Besides participating in the development or review of these 16 ISA, the WG will \ndevelop at least 20 Practice Notes that will suggest how the ISA can best be applied in public \nsector auditing. \n \n12.   INTOSAI can participate actively in the promulgation of ISA only if certain arrangements \nare made as early as possible, even before an ISA-specific task force is formed. A Focus \nGroup, consisting of experts from Cameroon, India, Peru, South Africa, Sweden, and the United \nKingdom, has therefore been formed to provide public sector input to IAASB project proposals.9\n \n13.  The Financial Audit Guidelines will be developed in two stages. In the first stage (for \nwhich ADB funding has been sought) Practice Notes for 20 ISA will be prepared, an additional 2 \nPractice Notes will be drafted, and the general sections of the Financial Audit Guidelines will be \ndeveloped. Stage 1 is expected to end in September 2007, when the International Congress of \nSupreme Audit Institutions (INCOSAI) is expected to endorse the first 20 Practice Notes. In \nStage 2, a further 9 Practice Notes will be prepared, INTOSAI (with IAASB) will continue to \npromulgate standards, and the complete Financial Audit Guidelines will be finalized. The target \ndate for the completion of Stage 2 is September 2010, when INCOSAI is expected to endorse \nthe full set of Practice Notes and the final version of the Financial Audit Guidelines. The \nINTOSAI Project Document is in Appendix 2 and the implementation schedule for Stage 1 is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n14.  To support these activities, Reference Panel members will meet once or twice each year \nto discuss progress to date, share lessons learned, and agree on and revise the terms of \nreference for participation in the ISA and Practice Note task forces. The Focus Group will meet  \nonce each year to give input to IAASB project proposals. And, finally, the WG will meet twice \neach year as the Project steering committee, providing Project oversight. The meetings of the \nFocus Group, Working Group, Reference Panel, and task forces tend to be held regionally, to \n                                                 \n7  These experts usually come from national supreme audit institutions. \n8  INTOSAI has 180 member states, of which 34 are ADB developing member countries. The Panel now includes \nrepresentatives from Azerbaijan, Bhutan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, India, Malaysia, \nNepal, Pakistan, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Viet Nam.  \n9  IAASB prepares a proposal for future ISA, once there is general agreement that a standard is required for a \nspecific topic, a task force is established, and a project is approved (the project objective being the promulgation of \nthe standard). \n ", "4   \nensure inclusive and global promulgation. ADB will support each of these activities by financing \nthe travel, printing, and dissemination costs. The budget provides for ADB\u2019s attendance at WG \nmeetings as a resource person - and its sponsorship of regional meetings to set accounting and \nauditing standards. These regional meetings would include meetings of the INTOSAI, IFAC, the \nConfederation of Asia Pacific Accountants (CAPA), and the International Accounting Standards \nBoard (IASB). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The  total  cost  of  the  preparation  of  the  International  Public  Sector  Financial  Audit \nGuidelines is estimated at $11.08 million. This will cover the general costs (including secretariat \ncosts,  WG  meetings,  Focus  Group  meetings,  and  translation  and  dissemination)  and \ndevelopment costs associated with promulgating the ISA, preparing Practice Notes, and drafting \nthe Financial Auditing Guidelines. The member SAIs will finance $9.647 million (primarily by \nproviding experts), IAASB will finance $356,000 and ADB will finance $235,000 on a grant basis \nfrom its TA funding program. The balance of costs will be met by external resources raised from \nother development partners, including the World Bank.10\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  SNAO, as WG chair, will be the Executing Agency for all TA components except for Part \nA(5), for which ADB will be the Executing Agency. SNAO will administer the TA funds and make \nall related organizational and administrative arrangements according to standard procedures. \nADB will monitor TA activities and will join some WG meetings as an observer.11 ADB will also \nreview and comment on ISA exposure drafts, Practice Notes, and the draft of the Financial Audit \nGuidelines. \n \n17.  The TA Project will be implemented from June 2005 to September 2007, when the \nINTOSAI Congress is expected to endorse at least 20 Practice Notes. TA funds, excluding \nthose for Part A(5)will be released as specific project milestones are reached, as shown in \nAppendix 1. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $235,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Preparation of International Public Sector Financial Audit Guidelines, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10   See detailed cost estimates and financing plan in Appendix 4. \n11   The IFAC is an observer for the Project, and WB and other potential financiers of the Project will also be invited to      \n      participate as observers in Project oversight. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \nPromote good governance  Increased public sector  Annual reports of the Working \nthrough more transparent  input into promulgation of  Group on Financial \nand accountable public  International Standards on  Management Guidelines \nsector management  Auditing \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nSupport the development  Reference Panel  Annual progress reports of  (cid:121)  Enough qualified members \nof financial audit  established and members  the Working Group on  available for the Reference \nguidelines based on  (including back-office  Financial Management  Panel \ninternational auditing and  support) appointed to  Guidelines   \nassurance standards  participate in IAASB task  \u2022  Enough support (and \npromulgated by IAASB  forces (one for each ISA  demand) from member SAIs \nto be promulgated or  to ensure that each SAI can \nreviewed) and  provide enough time to meet \nfour PN task forces  requirements \n(comprising  Reference   \nPanel members) formed  Risks \n(cid:121)  Not enough funding from \nexternal sources to cover \nout-of-pocket (i.e., non-staff) \nexpenses \n(cid:121)  Non-use of Guidelines by \nDMC SAIs \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The  different  processes  for  activities  within  the  WGFA  have  been \ndocumented. Due to creation of PN Task Forces and other changes there \nis a need to update and keep all processes carefully documented.   \n2.  The  basic  structure  of  the  Financial  Audit  Guidelines  introduced  in \nOctober 2004, will be further developed as ISA and PNs are approved. \n3.  Experts active in IAASB task forces will be provided in accordance with \nthe IAASB time table. Back-office experts will be appointed to all experts.   \n4.  PNs will be issued within nine months after a new ISA has been issued by \nthe IAASB. A PN is considered issued after the approval of the WGFA, \nwhile it is not yet an official INTOSAI document until it has been approved \nby  the  ASC,  decided  by  the  Governing  Board  and  endorsed  by  the \nINCOSAI. \n5.  All  PNs  Exposure  Drafts  will  be  published  on  the  ASC  website  for \ncomments. The comment period will be 3 months.   \n6.  When a PN has been issued it will be included in the Financial Audit \nGuidelines. \n7.  Clusters of experts supported by back-office experts will be introduced. \nThese clusters will be given the task to develop PNs to ISA not under \nrevision and not outlined as possible projects. Each cluster will comprise \nof two experts supported by 2-3 back-office experts. The first two clusters \nwill be formed in 2005 to deal with 5 ISA.  \n8.  The WGFA will meet twice a year to coordinate the work. Additional \ntelephone conferences will be held when necessary. A representative \nfrom IAASB will be invited to WGFA meetings. \n9.  The project director will establish forms of cooperation with IAASB and \nwill be responsible for contacts with IAASB and members of the WGFA \nbetween meetings. \n10.  SAIs will be re-invited to nominate experts on a yearly basis.  \n11.  Expert meetings will be held yearly in Stockholm, unless otherwise is \ndecided.  \n12.  The gap-analysis was conducted in 2004 and presented at the WGFA \nmeeting  in  March  2005.  The  ambition  of  the  gap-analysis  was  to \ndetermine  subject  areas  where  there  are  no  ISA,  but  a  need  for \nguidelines in the public sector. The gap-analysis will be further analyzed \nand a decision on additional guidance will be taken during 2005. \n13.  Channels of communication and cooperation between the WGFA and the \nWorking Group on Compliance audit will be established.  \n14.

Should INTOSAI fail to raise enough funds for the current budget, Practice Note preparation would need to be prioritized (a full set \nof retroactive Practice Notes may not have to be completed for the currently promulgated ISA). The degree of active involvement of SAI \nrepresentatives in the various working groups and task forces would also have to be scaled down. \nSource:  INTOSAI estimates. \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051205122646+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051202095814+08'00'", "Title": "Technical Assistance to the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions for the Preparation of International Public Sector Financial Guidelines", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "Company": "ADB", "SourceModified": "D:20051202015634"}}
