Chittagong Port is the premier port in Bangladesh, handling over 80% of the total sea-\nborne trade of the country. However, the very low efficiency levels at Chittagong Port impose a \ndirect cost on the country\u2019s trade competitiveness. The Government wants to improve this \nsituation and has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to \nprepare a project that will facilitate trade by improving the efficiency of the goods clearance \nprocess. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Bangladesh from 3 to 10 February 2003 and \nreached an understanding with the Government on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA is included in the \n2003 Country Strategy and Program Update for Bangladesh.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Chittagong Port is administered by the Chittagong Port Authority (CPA). The total cargo \nhandled at the port increased from 10.3 million tons in 1995/96 to 15.1 million tons in 1999/2000 \n\u2014 an annual average increase of 10%. The Chittagong Container Terminal (CCT), which is run \nby CPA, commenced operations in 1991. From 1991 to 1995, container traffic grew at an annual \naverage rate of 20%, and from 1995 to 2001, it grew at an annual average rate of 12.5%. In \n2001, the total container volume handled at Chittagong Port was 486,000 twenty-foot equivalent \nunits (TEU). More than half, viz., 256,000 TEU, was handled at the general cargo berths, while \nonly 230,000 TEU was handled at CCT. The operational efficiency of Chittagong Port is quite \nlow. For instance the container productivity per gang-hour of 9.73 is less than one third that \nachieved at the world\u2019s best ports. Also waiting times for ships for berths increased from 0.74 \ndays in 1996 to 2.25 days in 2000.  \n \n3.  Chittagong Port\u2019s low efficiency imposes a direct cost on the country. The total cost of \nclearing a container at Chittagong from the ship out of the port has been estimated to be $600 \ncompared with $150-300 in neighboring ports. Maritime transport costs account for 14% of the \ncost of Bangladesh\u2019s textile exports to the US, compared with less than 8% for its competitors \nsuch as People\u2019s Republic of China; India; Taiwan; China; and Thailand. It has been estimated \nthat Bangladesh\u2019s garment exports could earn 30% more if port inefficiencies were removed. At \ncurrent taxation levels, a 30% increase in earnings from garment exports would allow the \ncountry  to  invest  more  in  works,  services,  and  infrastructure  and  thus  accelerate  poverty \nreduction efforts. Furthermore, at present, Chittagong Port handles mainly Bangladeshi cargo. \nHowever the infrastructure that is being put into place including the proposed 1000 m length \nberths at the New Mooring Container Terminal (NMCT), with proper work practices, could itself \nhandle 1 million TEU. The CCT with adequate equipment ratios and good work practices should \nalso be able to handle another 500,000 TEU. Thus, improving efficiency will allow it to increase \ncapacity by 67% without any new infrastructure construction. Chittagong Port can then be an \nentry point for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation region.  \n \n4.  Several agencies are involved in the port sector, and the overall efficiency of the port is \ndependent on the efficiency of the individual agencies. One major agency is CPA, which is \nresponsible for the berthing of ships, loading and unloading of cargo, and storage of cargo \nwithin the port. The low labor productivity is an important factor in reducing Chittagong Port\u2019s \nefficiency.  There  is  also  no  proper  equipment  for  handling  containers  at  the  port.  This \ncontributes  to  low  efficiency  in  unloading/loading  containers.  This  constraint  has  been \nrecognized by CPA, which is planning to purchase cranes using its own resources to alleviate \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2003.  ", "2 \nthe situation. However, equipment purchase by itself and without a change in work processes \nwill not increase the efficiency as much as desired and needed.  \n \n5.  Furthermore as over half the containers are actually handled at the general cargo berths, \nwhere there is no back-up dedicated container freight station (CFS), the handling of containers \nis very inefficient. There are 19 small yards used as back-up areas for container storage. They \nare not only scattered but are in poor surface condition. Since everything is done manually, \ncontainer tracing over the 19 scattered yards is very time-consuming and inefficient. Related to \nthe rationalization of physical storage is the inefficient vehicle control within storage areas. The \ntraffic situation within the container storage area can be quite chaotic with trucks and vehicles \njamming  up  the  operational  area.  This  is  likely  to  worsen  when  the  NMCT  is  developed, \nbecause there is no seamless link between the port internal circulation road system and the \nproposed  port  access  road.2  There  is  a  need  to  build  a  bridge  and  improve  the  internal \ncirculation road within the port area to ensure a smooth connection with the proposed port \naccess road and thus smooth goods vehicle flow into and out of the port area.  \n \n6.  Another  major  agency  is  the  Customs  Department  which  is  responsible  for  the \ndocumentation clearance, goods inspection, and revenue collection aspects of the overall goods \nclearance process. The efficiency of the goods clearance process at the port is hampered by \ninefficient  and  outdated  Customs  work  practices,  some  of  which  are  mandated  by  legal \nrequirements.  Port  users  claim  that,  although  Customs  has  recently  computerized  its \noperations, there has been little impact on clearance times.3 A preshipment inspection (PSI) \nsystem was implemented recently whereby reputable private sector firms are appointed to verify \nthe customs documentation submitted by importers and compute the expected Customs duty \nbefore the forms are submitted to Customs. The National Board of Revenue (NBR) estimates \nthat in over 95% of consignments covered by PSI, Customs accepts the valuation estimated by \nthe firms. However, users state that it has not had the desired effect of expediting clearance, as \nCustoms still queries the documentation submitted even if ultimately there is no change in the \nduty as estimated by the PSI valuer. There is also no electronic data interchange (EDI) system \nto help expedite the clearance system. \n \n7.  Another important issue for Chittagong Port is effective environmental management. \nADB carried out a TA on this subject for Mongla Port in Bangladesh,4 completed in June 2002. \nStrengthening the environmental management capabilities of CPA must also be carried out, as \nthis is the major port in the country. CPA should be in a position to ensure that vessels docking \nat Chittagong Port are equipped with oil spill prevention and structures. CPA has to prepare \nlocal contingency plans and environmental management action plans for the Chittagong Port \narea; assign oil response teams at Chittagong Port; and install oil reception and disposal \nfacilities at Chittagong Port, which are lacking at the moment. CPA has also identified as a \nmajor area of concern the need to alleviate pollution from shore-based sources affecting areas \nwithin the Chittagong Port limits. Another area of serious concern identified by CPA is the \nhandling of hazardous material.  \n \n8.  The proposed Project will cover implementation of improved work practices, use of \ncomputerization to improve efficiency and reduce costs for port users, physical improvements to \ncomplement  new  work  practices,  and  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  CPA  to \n                                                 \n2  The  port  access  road  is  being  financed  under  ADB.  2000.

The output of this TA, especially on \nwork practice changes, will be the basis for the policy and governance reform agenda (including \nappropriate user complaint redress mechanisms) in any subsequent investment loan or loans. It \nis  anticipated  that,  should  the  policy  and  governance  reform  agenda  be  adopted  by  the \nGovernment, ADB will play a continuing role in improving the efficiency of the ports sector. In \nview of ADB\u2019s past experience in the country\u2019s port sector regarding policy and governance \nreform, an incremental approach is being adopted to ensure buy-in by all stakeholders.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The objective of this TA is to facilitate the preparation of the proposed Project. The TA \nwill  have  three  components.  The  objective  of  the  first  component  is  to  improve  the  work \npractices  of  CPA  and  Customs  for  ship  berthing  and  container  clearance  by  improving \nprocesses and procedures and simplifying documentation as well as better interfacing between \nCustoms and CPA in the ship berthing and container clearance process. The TA will also \nprepare a master plan for the introduction of EDI at Chittagong Port. The objective of the second \ncomponent  is  to  recommend  physical  improvements  necessary  within  the  CPA  area  to \ncomplement  the  improved  work  practices  in  facilitating  the  container  clearance  process  in \nChittagong Port. This will include recommendations for improvements in the physical layout of \nthe container yards and container freight stations; better vehicle traffic flow within the port \noperations  area;  as  well  as  preliminary  engineering  of  structures,  buildings,  and  internal \ncirculation roads needed within the port area to efficiently link with the proposed port access \nroad. The objective of the third component is to recommend measures to improve CPA\u2019s \ncapabilities in environmental management. It will build upon the recommendations of TA 3357 \nBAN:  Oil  Spill  Impact  and  Response  Management  Program  (footnote  4)  as  well  the \nenvironmental issues identified by CPA such as controlling pollution from shore-based sources \nand handling of hazardous material. It will also make recommendations on the preparatory \nactions  that  CPA  has  to  undertake  to  comply  with  international  marine  pollution  standard \n(MARPOL 73/78) when it is ratified by the Government. A rapid environmental assessment has \nbeen done, and this Project is classified as Category B.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Process flow analyses of both the documentation submissions and approvals required \nfor container ship berthing and clearance as well as the physical movement of containers are \nrequired to identify how long each document and each container is with the various government \nagencies involved. These two activities will form the key to identifying improvements in work \npractices by CPA and Customs as well as the physical improvements needed to complement \nimprovements in work practices. The consultants should at the outset of their work consult with \nusers to benefit from their experience when formulating ways to improve work practices. There \nshould  also  be  regular  consultation  with  labor  unions  to  ensure  buy-in  from  the  unions. \nPreliminary engineering work will be needed to obtain the technical and cost parameters of the \nproposed improvements. The work on the environmental management component will build \nupon the recommendations of TA 3357 BAN: Oil Spill Impact and Response Management \nProgram (footnote 4). At the same time, field surveys will be carried out to recommend ways to \nidentify the extent of shore-based pollution and identify ways to control such pollution. It is also \nnecessary to carry out activities to ensure compliance with ADB social and environmental \nsafeguard policies.  ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The cost of the TA is $625,000 equivalent, comprising $286,000 in foreign exchange \ncosts and $339,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $500,000 equivalent to \nfinance the entire foreign exchange costs of $286,000 and $214,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency costs. The Government will provide $125,000 equivalent for local currency costs in the \nform of services and facilities including counterpart staff, office accommodation, transport, and \nadministrative resources. The budget includes provision for the travel costs for government \nrepresentatives to Manila for contract negotiations. Details of the cost estimates and financing \nplan are shown in Appendix 1. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been advised that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  CPA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Secretary,  Internal  Resources \nDivision, Ministry of Finance and Secretary, Ministry of Shipping will cochair a project steering \ncommittee consisting of NBR, Ministry of Shipping, CPA, Customs House Chittagong, Ministry \nof Environment and Forests, and Department of Environment. The steering committee will meet \nmonthly and provide policy guidance as well as overall coordination and support to the study. \nThere will be two implementing agencies. NBR be will the implementing agency for the first \ncomponent of the TA, i.e., improving the efficiency of the container clearance process by \nimproving processes, procedures, and documentation as well as better interfacing between \nCustoms House Chittagong and CPA in the container clearance process. The Customs House \nChittagong  and  CPA  will  cochair  a  technical  subcommittee  that  will  closely  monitor  this \ncomponent of the TA and report to the steering committee. The technical subcommittee will \ndiscuss the working details of the study. This subcommittee will meet at least once a month to \nconsider the progress of the study. CPA will be the implementing agency for the second and \nthird components of the study, viz, on physical improvements necessary within the CPA area to \ncomplement the first component in improving the container clearance process in Chittagong \nPort, as well as on environmental management. CPA and Customs House Chittagong will \ncochair a technical subcommittee that will closely monitor this component of the TA and report \nto the steering committee. CPA will chair a technical subcommittee for the third component, \nwhich will consist of officials from CPA, DOE, and Chittagong local authorities.  \n \n13.  An  international  consultant  firm  with  expertise  in  (i)  port  operations,  port  traffic \ncirculation, container freight station, and container yard operations; and (ii) modern customs \nclearance procedures, EDI, and port computerization supported by domestic consultants with \nexpertise in (a) civil engineering of structures, buildings, roads, and bridges; (b) environment \nassessment, environmental management including familiarity with international marine pollution \nstandards, (c) social impact analysis and preparation of resettlement action plans; and (d) local \nlegal system will be engaged by ADB under the TA. The consultants will be recruited through an \ninternational consulting firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants, using the \nquality-and-cost based selection method. A simplified technical proposal will be requested from \nthe consulting firms. An estimated 10 person-months of international and 25 person-months of \ndomestic consulting services will be required. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are \nattached as Appendix 2. The consultants will procure equipment such as computers, printers, \nsoftware, and other office equipment, which will be turned over to the Executing Agency after ", "    5 \nTA  completion.  The  Summary  Initial  Poverty  and  Social  Analysis  (IPSA)  is  attached  as \nAppendix 3.  \n \n14.  The TA is expected to be carried out over 4 months, starting in August 2003 and ending \nin November 2003. Two tripartite review meetings will be held, one to consider the inception \nreport, and the second to consider the draft final report. In addition, there will be an ADB review \nmission at the end of the third month after TA commencement. The consultants will also be \nrequired to organize two workshops, one after the inception report is submitted and the other \nafter the draft final report is submitted, to which all relevant port stakeholders will be invited. The \npurpose is to give all concerned an opportunity to present their views and suggestions about the \ndirection and findings of the study. The second workshop has an additional objective: to inform \npotential users of the improvements envisaged at the port. The TA budget provides for these \nworkshops and for the dissemination of information.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n15.

Within the transport sector, the ports \nsusector plays a role in facilitating international trade. Chittagong Port\u2019slolw efficiency levels also impose a direct cost \non the country. The total cost of moving a container has been estimated to be higher in Chittagong than in neighboring \nports. Maritime transport costs account for 14% of the cost of Bangladesh\u2019s textile exports to the US, compared with \nless than 8% for its competitors such as People\u2019s Republic of China; India; Taiwan and Thailand. It has been estimated \nthat Bangladesh\u2019s garment exports could therefore earn more if port inefficiencies were removed. An increase in \nearnings from garment exports would allow the country to invest more in works, services and infrastructure and thus \naccelerate reduction efforts. \n \nB.
