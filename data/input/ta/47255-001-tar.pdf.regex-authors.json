INTRODUCTION \n1.  Colombo is the capital city and the most important commercial, industrial, and cultural \ncenter of Sri Lanka with a population of about 1 million people. It is governed by Colombo \nMunicipal  Council  (CMC),  which  is responsible for  provision  of  a  wide  range  of municipal \nservices,  including  wastewater  management  services.  CMC  operates  a  320-kilometer \nwastewater collection network, 18 pumping stations, and two sea outfalls to collect and dispose \nof untreated wastewater into the sea. The sewer mains, pumping stations, and two sea outfalls \nare being rehabilitated as part of the Greater Colombo Wastewater Management Project of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB).1 Under the newly approved multitranche financing facility for \nthe Greater Colombo Water and Wastewater Management Improvement Investment Program, \nADB will continue support for CMC to improve and expand the sewer network and to build two \nnew wastewater treatment plants\u2014helping CMC achieve full coverage of wastewater collection \nand discontinue its practice of discharging untreated wastewater into the sea. 2 \n  \n2.  To achieve these objectives in an efficient and sustainable manner, the Government of \nSri Lanka requested ADB to provide capacity development technical assistance (TA) to help \nCMC undertake reforms in two areas: (i) to introduce and design a wastewater tariff mechanism \nto finance operation and maintenance (O&M) of the wastewater collection and treatment system, \nand (ii) to explore the possibility of involving the private sector in construction and/or operation \nof the two planned wastewater treatment plants through a public\u2013private partnership (PPP). The \nTA is included in the ADB country operations business plan for Sri Lanka, 2014\u20132016.3 An ADB \nfact-finding mission was conducted from 10 to 15 June 2014. This report is based on the \nunderstanding reached with the government and CMC regarding the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs  and financing  arrangements,  and  the  outline  terms  of \nreference for consulting services to be provided under the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework of the TA is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In  Sri  Lanka,  urban  wastewater  management  services  are  provided  by  CMC  for \nColombo city, and by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board for other municipalities \nand urban councils outside Colombo city. In 2008, the National Water Supply and Drainage \nBoard introduced a wastewater tariff as a funding mechanism for the O&M of wastewater \nmanagement services in its service areas, including other municipalities and urban councils \nwithin Greater Colombo. CMC has continued to rely on budget allocation through general \nrevenue as the funding source for the combined municipal services of flood control, drainage, \nand wastewater management. Wastewater management services under CMC have suffered \nfrom  lack  of  adequate  funding  support  for  O&M  because  of  competing  needs  for  budget \nresources. Since wastewater operation has a lower priority than flood control and drainage, the \nsewage  collection  system  has  been  deteriorating.  Sewer  blockages  and  overflows  are \ncommon\u2014posing an increasing public health and environmental hazard. The direct discharge of \nuntreated  wastewater  into  the  sea  remains  unchanged  despite  a  significant  increase  in \nwastewater volume as a result of rapid urbanization.    \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n                                                \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n1 ADB. 2009.

Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n4 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 May 2014. \n ", "2 \n4.  While  providing  support  for  CMC  to  upgrade  and  expand  its  wastewater  collection \nsystem and build two new wastewater treatment plants, ADB has agreed with CMC to separate \nthe wastewater management service function from other municipal services like drainage, which \nmay be funded to an extent by the wastewater tariff for its O&M. The proposed wastewater tariff \nmay perform, among others, two basic functions: (i) as a dedicated funding mechanism for O&M \nof  the  increasingly  sophisticated  wastewater  collection  system  and  two  new  wastewater \ntreatment plants in CMC to improve operational sustainability; and (ii) as a policy instrument to \nstrengthen  environmental  management  following  the  polluter  pays  principle,  through  which \nresidents of Colombo city, like people living in other municipalities and urban councils, will pay \nwastewater service fees in accordance with the wastewater service received.    \n \n5.  The construction of two planned wastewater treatment plants will have a significant \nimpact on improving wastewater management services in Colombo city. This will present a \nmajor  operational  and  management  challenge  to  CMC  because  of  its  lack  of  knowledge, \nexperience, expertise, and institutional capability in this field. Given these constraints, CMC will \nlikely need to explore private sector involvement, through a PPP arrangement, in dealing with \nthe  challenges  in  design,  construction,  and/or operation and management  of the  two  new \nwastewater treatment plants. This may also require a wastewater tariff as a dedicated funding \nsource to strengthen operational sustainability and project viability.  \n \n6.  The proposed TA will help the government and CMC address two major challenges \narising  from  the  ADB  loan-funded  upgrading  and  expansion  of  wastewater  management \nservices in Colombo city. It will help CMC establish the guiding principles and pricing policy for \nwastewater management services in Colombo city, and recommend a realistic implementation \nstrategy for the phased introduction of a wastewater tariff in the city, taking into account the \npace  of  service  improvement  and  the  affordability  concern  of  disadvantaged  groups  in \nunderserved areas. The TA will also help CMC assess the options available for PPP in the \nconstruction and/or management of the two new wastewater treatment plants to be built in \nColombo city, and help CMC address the policy and operational challenges arising from the \nintroduction of new services to the city, including providing capacity development support for \nspecialized staff training and institutional strengthening. The proposed TA will complement the \nfinancial support provided by ADB for wastewater management improvement under the ongoing \nADB-financed project and investment program (footnotes 1 and 2).  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  impact  will  be  improved  financial  sustainability  and  operations  of  wastewater \nservices in Colombo city, demonstrated by (i) cost of O&M recovered through revenues from \nwastewater services, and (ii) two wastewater treatment plants meet mandatory wastewater \ndischarge  standards.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  capacity  to  operate  and  maintain \nwastewater services in Colombo city, through (i) a CMC resolution to implement a wastewater \ntariff scheme approved and (ii) PPP contracts for the two wastewater treatment plants initiated.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The formulation and implementation of a wastewater tariff for CMC will improve the \nfinancial position of CMC\u2019s wastewater service division\u2014enabling it to provide adequate funds \nto cover O&M cost, meet debt service obligations, and improve the overall level of wastewater \nservices in Colombo city. The formulation and implementation of a PPP contract will enable ", "3 \nCMC to manage and operate the two new wastewater treatment plants efficiently, and thereby \nmeet stipulated treatment standards and reduce pollution discharge into the sea. \n \n9.  The TA will have three key outputs. The first output is the preparation of a wastewater \ntariff scheme that is expected to be adopted by CMC following full consultation with citizens and \nstakeholders. The wastewater tariff scheme is expected to recover a high proportion of the costs \nimposed on the wastewater system by high wastewater volume producers and entities that \ngenerate significant pollution, while being sensitive to the needs of low-income families in \nunderserved areas. The level of the wastewater tariff will be set in accordance with information \ngathered through a willingness-to-pay survey and affordability analysis. The new wastewater \ntariff scheme is expected to be adopted by CMC and implemented in early 2016.  \n \n10.  The second output is the identification and preparation of a PPP arrangement for the two \nnew wastewater treatment plants. A broader set of PPP options will be reviewed, and best \npractice will be followed for effective implementation of a PPP arrangement for wastewater \ntreatment plants. Bidding documents and a draft contractual agreement for the preferred PPP \noption will also be prepared, so that CMC may seek bids from interested and experienced PPP \noperators and reach agreement with the successful bidder. The PPP contract is expected to be \nagreed in 2016, when the two treatment plants are scheduled to be constructed. This PPP \narrangement  is  expected  to  provide  professional  management  services  for  two  planned \nwastewater treatment plants for about 10\u201320 years. \n \n11.  The third output is the implementation of an information campaign and training program. \nThe information campaign will be conducted for both implementation of the wastewater tariff \nscheme and the PPP, and will encompass a range of activities including two workshops that will \nseek the participation of at least 50 stakeholders including at least 20 women participants. The \ntraining program will focus on ensuring that all CMC staff who have a link to implementation of \nthe wastewater tariff scheme and PPP arrangements have a good understanding of their role \nand responsibilities in this regard. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented to achieve the outcome through (i) improving the capacity of \nCMC staff to implement and manage Colombo city\u2019s wastewater tariff system; (ii) improving the \nquality of wastewater service operations through enabling greater spending to be undertaken on \nO&M activities (e.g., reduced sewer blockages, sewage overflows, and pump breakdowns) \nthrough increased revenues earned from the introduction of a wastewater tariff; (iii) developing \nthe capacity of staff employed in all relevant divisions of CMC (e.g., finance, procurement, \nwastewater, etc.) to implement and manage PPP arrangements with respect to the two new \nwastewater treatment plants; and (iv) helping ensure that the two new wastewater treatment \nplants  are  effectively  and  efficiently  managed through  the  appointment  of a qualified  PPP \ncontractor.  \n \n13.  The major risk for PPP is that CMC will default on payments to the PPP operator. \nHowever, this can be mitigated with CMC introducing the wastewater tariff. The major risks to \nthe introduction of the wastewater tariff will be opposition from citizens who face a rising cost of \nliving  because  of  inflation.  Labor  unions  may  also  have  concerns  over  private  sector \ninvolvement, given the potential risk of job losses. However, these issues are manageable \nbecause the wastewater tariff scheme will be designed taking into consideration affordability \nconcerns  of  low-income  families,  and  will  be  implemented  gradually.  The  two  planned \nwastewater treatment plants will create new job opportunities. During TA implementation, the \nconsultants  will  need  to  conduct  workshops  for  stakeholders  (including  citizens  and  labor \nunions), assist CMC in its public awareness campaign, and help develop consensus among ", "4 \nCMC councilors over the need for the proposed changes by informing them of the benefits that \nwill  accrue  to  the  city  and  its  residents.  Implementation  arrangements  for  introducing  the \nwastewater tariff will need to take into account the concerns and interests of the poor and \nmarginalized groups, and ensure that an equitable approach is adopted in which a greater share \nof costs are recovered from those who use more water and generate more wastewater as well \nas those entities that contribute to significant pollution discharges. There is assumption that \nCMC will adjust tariffs periodically to meet revenue requirements. \n \n14.  A considerable amount of consultation and dissemination through group discussions, \nworkshops,  and  awareness  campaigns  will  be  necessary  to  obtain  the  support  of  all \nstakeholders. The TA consultants will work closely with CMC and stakeholders in achieving this \noutcome. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, office supplies, \nsecretarial assistance and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The executing agency will be the Ministry of Local Government and Provincial Councils, \nwhich will provide overall policy guidance and oversight for the TA. The implementing agency \nwill be CMC, with implementation carried out through the existing project management unit of \nCMC, which is also responsible for preparing the third and fourth projects of the Investment \nProgram. CMC also manages implementation of the ongoing Greater Colombo Wastewater \nManagement Project. The project management unit is comprised of a project director (sanitary \nengineer),  deputy  project  director  (technical  and  institution),  environmental  engineers, \nprocurement  staff,  and  an  accountant,  supported  by  international  and  national  design \nsupervision consultants and institutional development consultants. CMC has adequate capacity \nto manage activities related to the TA.  \n \n17.  The TA  will  be  implemented  over  2  years from  October  2014  to  September  2016. \nConsulting services totaling 30 person-months (15 person-months international and 15 person-\nmonths national) will be required. The international consultants will provide expertise in the \nfields of water sector utility finances, wastewater tariff, and PPP. The national consultants will \nprovide support on technical issues, public communications, and legal aspects. In addition to \nconsulting services, resource persons may be invited to speak at workshops to provide the \nlatest knowledge on wastewater tariffs and PPP to key stakeholders and the consultants. Five \nexperts will be engaged: two international consultants (a team leader and a PPP expert) and \nthree  national  consultants  (a  wastewater  technical  specialist,  a  legal  expert,  and  a  public \ncommunications expert) under the TA. \n \n18.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time) on an individual basis. Outline terms of \nreference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  resource  persons  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).   ", "5 \n19.  The consultants will submit four major reports: (i) an inception report within 2 months \nafter TA commencement, (ii) an interim report within 1 year from the commencement date of \ntheir contract, (iii) a draft final report after the 20 months from the commencement date of their \ncontract, and (iv) a final report after the receipt of comments from the government and ADB on \nthe draft report.      \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Wastewater Management Improvement in \nColombo Municipal Council, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
