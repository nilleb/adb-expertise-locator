INTRODUCTION\n1. Some  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (PDMCs)  rank  very  low  on  the  United\nNations (UN) human development index due to the region\u2019s generally low levels of education,\nfunctional literacy, and health and nutritional standards. Women are significantly disadvantaged\nin relation to men in most PDMCs. The youth are another highly vulnerable group. Policymakers\nmust recognize the persistent and increasing burden of poverty on women and young people\nand \u201cantipoverty plans must be integrated into economic, not just social, policies and into the\ngeneral budget allocation.\u201d1 During the UN conferences of the 1990s, governments around the\nworld committed themselves to a \u201cpeople-centered\u201d vision of social and economic development\nand agreed on their common goals: poverty reduction, elimination of social inequalities such as\nthose based on gender, and living in harmony with the environment. The governments also\nrecognized that \u201cpolicy without the corresponding dedication of financial resources would be\nmeaningless.\u201d 2\n2. Government  budgets  have  a  central  role  in  the  planning  and  control  of  countries\u2019\neconomic activities and are powerful policy tools with profound implications for social equity.\nThis  technical  assistance  (TA)  seeks  to  improve  public  expenditure  management  (PEM)\nsystems to achieve better outcomes for women and youth3 by developing methods and skills in\ngender and youth analysis to ensure women and youth equitable access to social services, and\nequal access to and control over economic resources. The TA will thus help improve the\neconomic efficiency of resource allocation, protect pro-poor and pro-women spending in times\nof aggregate fiscal contraction, and direct resources to those in greatest need. This assistance\nis  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  overarching  objective  of  poverty  reduction.  The  TA  framework  is  in\nAppendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Making government spending more responsive to the demands of poverty reduction\nrequires improved allocation and effective use of resources. The growing consensus is that the\nsocial impact of macroeconomic policies on vulnerable groups has to receive more attention. At\nthe same time, the demand for social control of government finances and greater participation in\npolicy processes is increasing and has led to a number of initiatives such as gender-sensitive\nbudgeting or pro-poor budget initiatives.\n4. Although their vulnerability varies widely across countries and cultures, women and\nyouth in PDMCs are considered particularly vulnerable. The Pacific islands have both patrilineal\nand matrilineal cultures that influence descent and inheritance. However, as a result of land\ntenure conversion and registration, women\u2019s tenure rights and ability to make decisions on\ninheritance are being eroded because male interests dominate the new management structures.\nThe power to own and control economic resources is vested increasingly in men, and women\nhave considerably limited access to resources, power, and decision making. Women and men\nface gender-specific risks under most PDMCs\u2019 economic reform programs. Women have less\naccess to resources such as education, labor market experience, and assets that can help\ncushion economic shocks. Women are more directly affected by reductions in social welfare\nspending and public programs. Privatization and welfare cuts often mean that social services\n                  \n1 UNDP Poverty Report 2000.\n2 UNDP. SEPED Conference Paper Series No 4, May 2000\n3 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on  26 March 2001.", "2\nare  shifted  from  the  paid  public  sector  to  the  unpaid  domestic  labor  of  women,  who  are\nhouseholds\u2019 main caregivers.\n5. Young people under 25 represent more than 50 percent of the population in the PDMCs.\nPast and current population growth has outstripped the capabilities of the PDMCs to provide\nemployment and education to young people. The inability of governments, formal and nonformal\nschool systems, and the private sector to meet young people\u2019s needs make youth vulnerable to\ndrugs and alcohol abuse,  delinquency, and violence, including suicide.4 Teenage pregnancy is\na major health problem.  Urban areas tend to draw in disaffected, bored, and dispirited youths\nfrom the villages or outer islands, giving rise to political instability. Youth participation in the\ntraditional hierarchical Pacific societies is often limited, restricting young people\u2019s opportunities\nto influence decision making.\n6. The lack of opportunity for women and youth cannot be addressed by mere social\ninterventions but by economic policies and improved resource allocation. In the Pacific, the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) has given mostly direct support to women\u2019s organizations and\npolicies.5 National machineries are recognized as the institutional catalysts for promoting gender\nequality, which, however, still faces major obstacles in the form of inadequate financial and\nhuman resources, insufficient official understanding of gender mainstreaming, and competing\ngovernment priorities. Few countries have adequately identified youth issues or strategies.\n7. In the past 15 years \u201cpeople-centered\u201d budget initiatives have examined budgets through\na  poverty  or  gender  lens.  Since  1984,  gender-sensitive  budget  management  has  been\nundertaken in developed and developing countries and has given rise to a substantial body of\ntheory and practice. The movement to improve budget management gained strength in the\nwake of the agreements of the 1995 Beijing Conference.6 In 1995, the Commonwealth Plan of\nAction on Gender and Development advocated the integration of a gender perspective into\nmacroeconomic policies. Twenty countries have since developed initiatives to strengthen the\nimpact of economic policies on women, emphasizing accountability and transparency in public\nexpenditure management.7\n8. By supporting economic, governance, and public sector reform programs, ADB provides\ncapacity-building assistance in budgeting and financial management in 8 of the 12 PDMCs.\nADB also provides TA to manage and support the reform processes in the PDMCs and East\nTimor by training senior government officials. 8  The national budget is the primary fiscal policy\ninstrument that should reflect the highest level of political commitment and socioeconomic\npolicies of a government. Understanding the nature of women\u2019s and youth\u2019s disadvantage and\nthe social relations, structures, and organizations that maintain their disadvantage is the basis of\n                  \n4 According to the World Health Organization, in 1994  the Pacific had in 1994 the highest youth suicide rate in the\nworld.\n5 SSTA for Institutional Strengthening of the Vanuatu Council of Women, TA 3360 FIJ: Women\u2019s Plan of Action, TA\n2058 TON: Coordination of Women\u2019s Development Programs, TA 1983 RMI: Institutional Strengthening of the\nWomen\u2019s Affair Division of Social Services Ministry.\n6 Beijing Platform for Action, Fourth United Nations World Conference on Women, Beijing, 4-15 September 1995.\n7  Some of the experiences are listed below. The Commonwealth Secretariat initiated a pilot process in Sri Lanka,\nSouth Africa, Barbados, and Fiji Islands (where, the experience ended in political turmoil). Another Caribbean\ninitiative is the one in St Kitts-Nevis. Since 1995, the Philippines has had the Gender and Development Budget\nPolicy, and attempts are under way in India. In Africa, initiatives exist in Namibia, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, and\nZimbabwe. Australia has been a leader in Gender-Budget, and nongovernment organization initiatives exist in\nCanada and the United States.\n8  TA 5908-REG: Pacific Governance and Public Sector Management Training Program, for $300,000, approved on\n31 March 2000.", "3\ninformed debate about policy and the appropriate allocation of public expenditure. A youth- or\ngender-sensitive  budget  is  expected  to  improve  efficiency  in  expenditure  allocation  and\nresource use through effective targeting and monitoring to promote gender equality and improve\nopportunities for young people; this will, in turn, increase productivity and improve equity and\nsocial stability.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n9. The  TA\u2019s  main  objective  is  to  improve  PEM  by  integrating  a  gender  and  youth\nperspective into governments\u2019 budget policies. A sound PEM system and a good understanding\nof how input affects outcome is expected to improve the status of women and youth through\nefficient and equitable resource allocation, resulting in improved economic productivity through\nbetter use of human resources. The TA has the following specific objectives:\n(i)  learn  from  global  \u201cgood  practices\u201d  to  design  \u201cpeople-centered\u201d  budgets  and\ngender-appropriate policies, programs, and institutions\n(ii)  assist governments to collect disaggregated data on gender and age groups\n(iii)  build capacities of senior government officials and representatives of women\u2019s\nand youth organizations to support the implementation of gender- and youth-\nsensitive PEM\nB. Scope\n10. In coordination with ADB ongoing assistance in finance, planning, and economic reform,\nthe TA will help governments apply the analytical and methodological tools, and develop the\nmechanisms  for  integrating  gender  and  youth  issues  into  budget  preparation.  The  TA  will\ncoincide with the yearly cycle of budget preparation and follow-up.\n11. Reorienting the national budget to make it more youth- and gender-appropriate requires\na  sound  expenditure  management  system  and  sufficient  data.  The  TA  will  thus  have  two\nphases, covering two budget cycles. Phase 1 will include the following tasks:\n(i)  Review the procedures for (a) preparing the budget, (b) measuring the outputs of\nexpenditure programs, (c) evaluating performances against the outputs, and (d)\nensuring a satisfactory flow of information between the Ministry of Finance and\nthe spending entities.\n(ii)  Establish  administrative  mechanisms  for  initiating  and  strengthening  policy\ndialogue among the Ministry of Finance, key spending ministries, and youth and\nwomen\u2019s  organizations  through  a  program  coordination  mechanism,  that\nidentifies a finance official to serve as the project liaison in government, and a\nsteering committee of senior officials from all the key ministries to oversee the\nprogram\u2019s implementation.\n(iii)  Assess data, availability of gender-specific and age-group statistics and gaps in\ntheir generation and use.\n(iv)  Analyze youth and gender roles and responsibilities in activities supported by the\nbudget process, and the impact of delivery mechanisms.\n(v)  Analyze  the  potential  impacts  of  the  budget  on  young  people  and  women,\nespecially the poor.", "4\n(vi)  Capacity building of  ministries responsible for women's and youth affairs, as well\nas civil-society groups,  so that they can play a critical role in the program.\nUnder phase 1, activities related to budget procedures review and data assessment will be\nundertaken  by  consultants  already  fielded  by  ADB  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  or  Treasury\nDepartment of participating PDMCs. The technical tools already developed and used in various\ndeveloping countries will be identified, tested, and adapted to the requirements of the PDMCs in\nphase 1.\n12. Phase 2 will assist governments during budget preparation to integrate gender and\nyouth perspectives into budget allocation. The phase will include\n(i)  selecting areas of policy focus and strategic interventions, based on country-\nspecific analyses, institutional analysis, and locally determined priorities;\n(ii)  developing youth- and gender-sensitive goals and indicators of success for the\nareas identified;\n(iii)  prioritizing  and  disaggregating  projected  expenditure  into  age-  and  gender-\nrelevant categories; and\n(iv)  monitoring by women\u2019s and youth organizations and departments of the budget\nprocess and its impact on gender and youth.\n13. The expected outcomes are improved accountability, transparency, and increased civil-\nsociety participation in budget preparation. Strengthening the institutional and communication\nlinkages within the government, notably between the Ministry of Finance and all ministries\ninvolved  in  gender  and  youth  issues,  will  help  to  prioritize  youth  and  gender  policies  in\nexpenditure plans.\n14. Two  pilot countries have been selected to implement the TA: Samoa for the \u201cyouth\nbudget\u201d and the Republic of Marshall Islands for the \u201cgender-budget.\u201d They already receive\ntechnical assistance for capacity building in PEM,9 which has strengthened their budgeting\nsystems. The Government of Samoa identifies youth as the most vulnerable group. Samoa\u2019s\nNational Youth Policy was designed based on data collection done to create youth profile, and\nadministrative data has been transformed into useful information. A number of nongovernment\norganizations  (NGOs)  and  churches  are  involved  with  youth,  and  participated  in  the\nconsultations held to prepare the National Youth Policy. In the Marshall Islands, the Ministry of\nWomen Affairs and women\u2019s groups are active, support the gender policy, and provide a good\nbasis for civil-society involvement in budget management.\n15. During phase 1, the TA, in collaboration with the ADB Institute, will offer training-of-\ntrainers module on gender-sensitive PEM for PDMCs to develop Pacific public sector managers\u2019\nawareness and understanding of international themes and practices. Criteria for admission will\nbe agreed on by ADB and the Institute to ensure that participants come from agencies and are\nin positions that will maximize their capacity to train others and to disseminate the experience\nacquired from the module. The module will be completed by a follow-up session organized in\neach country during phase 2.\n                  \n9  TA 3418-RMI: Strengthening the Capacity of the Ministry of Finance, for $150,000, approved on 21 March 2000.\nTA 3311-SAM: Strengthening Capacity for Macroeconomic Analysis, Planning and Policy Formulation (Phase 4),\nfor $690,000, approved on 25 November 1999.", "5\n16. Training workshops, notably on gender awareness and poverty mainstreaming, will be\norganized in the pilot countries for officials from the Ministry of Finance and other line ministries,\nwith  technical  support  from  the  Commonwealth  Secretariat,  to  strengthen  organizational\ncommitment  and  foster  a  better  understanding  of  the  TA\u2019s  processes.  To  ensure  the\nsustainability of the processes and the accountability of the Ministry of Finance to citizens, the\nTA will help youth NGOs and women\u2019s groups to reinforce their advocacy role.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $460,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $300,000\non a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The\nbalance will be cofinanced by the ADB Institute and the Commonwealth Secretariat. The ADB\nInstitute will help organize and fund in-country training. The Commonwealth Secretariat will\nprovide resource persons to implement the TA and workshops. Appendix 2 provides detailed\ncost estimates.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n18. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB\u2019s Office of Pacific Operations will be\nresponsible for processing and supervising the TA. The Department of Budget and Finance in\neach participating country will be the focal agency, and endorsement from the ministers of\nfinance  will  be  sought  to  ensure  the  TA\u2019s  political  acceptability.  Youth  and  women\u2019s\norganizations in each country will be involved in the TA implementation through workshops. The\nTA is expected to be implemented in two phases over 15 months, from May 2001 to August\n2002. Phase 1 will be implemented from May 2001 to January 2002, and phase 2 from February\n2002 to August 2002.\n19. The Commonwealth Secretariat, given its broad experience in gender-sensitive budget\nmanagement, will provide technical support to sensitize key stakeholders (Government and civil\nsociety) and train their representatives.\n20. A team of four international consultants, economists and experts in gender analysis, will\nbe  recruited  for  six  person-months,  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  the\nparticipating countries for eight person-months, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. Detailed terms of reference are presented in Appendix 3.\n21. The team leader for the international consultants will be required to submit a brief\ninception report one month after the commencement of the TA establishing milestones and\ntimebound output agreed upon with ADB. A comprehensive interim report will be submitted at\nthe end of phase 1. The team leader will also submit a final report summing up the findings,\nprogress and achievements during the TA. The final report will include recommendations to\nextend the process to other countries.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n22.
