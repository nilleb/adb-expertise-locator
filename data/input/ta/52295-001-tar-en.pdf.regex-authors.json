THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will design, pilot, setup, and operationalize the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Ventures Facility (the Facility): a multi-donor trust fund that will \ncontribute towards sustainable development goals (SDGs) by deploying and scaling impactful \ntechnologies and business models throughout the developing Asia-Pacific. \n \n2.  The Facility will provide technical assistance and make catalytic investments in early-stage \nprivate companies to accelerate the deployment of impactful technologies and business models. \nThe Facility fills an operational gap allowing ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \nto provide funding at all stages of the business life cycle. Where necessary ADB\u2019s PSOD will \nadopt a One ADB approach by working closely with ADB regional and knowledge departments to \nleverage government relationships, operational networks, and industry knowledge. \n     \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Opportunity: The Asia-Pacific has made great strides in poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth, but the region still lags behind on two-thirds of the SDGs.1 The world is brimming with \ntechnologies and innovative business models that conserve energy, reduce waste, improve crop \nyields and quality, deliver public services more effectively to low income population groups, and \notherwise contribute to SDG impacts. Such technologies have achieved wide implementation in \nlarger, more developed markets. They have tantalizing potential for impact in developing markets. \nMeanwhile, the cost of deploying and scaling technology has plummeted. For example, the unit \ncost of sensors has declined by over 60% between 2004-2017 making the deployment of internet \nof things solutions feasible in the developing Asia-Pacific including remote communities.  \n \n4.  Problem: In emerging markets, private sector innovation can originate from two sources: \nhomegrown entrepreneurs or global technology companies. Correspondingly, the deployment of \nimpactful technologies in the developing Asia-Pacific has been impeded by: \n \n(i)  Nascent innovation ecosystems.2 Collaborative innovation ecosystems involving \nregulators,  corporates,  research  institutes,  and  entrepreneurs  remain  nascent \nacross most of developing Asia-Pacific. Regulatory uncertainty, red-tape, and weak \nintellectual  property  rights  protection  discourage  investment  in  technology \ninnovation. Promising homegrown entrepreneurs need support and networks to \ncommercialize  products  and  secure  initial  customers.  Yet  government-funded \ninnovation and business support programs tend to be fragmented, limited, and \nuneven in quality.  \n \n(ii)  Low technology transfer. Weak network effects have impeded the diffusion of \ntechnology from global technology companies to the developing Asia-Pacific.3 \nMarkets  are  diverse  and  fragmented  by  language,  geography,  culture,  and \nbusiness  enabling  environment.  Technologies  and  business  models  must  be \nadapted  market-by-market  to  a  variety  of  norms,  often  amid  limited  market \n                                                \n1  http://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/publications/Asia-Pacific-SDG-Progress-Report-2017.pdf \n2  The innovation ecosystem describes the large number and diverse nature of participants and resources that are \nnecessary for innovation including entrepreneurs, research institutes, investor community, and commercial industry. \n3  Network effects is the increase in value of a product or service as more customers use it. So the larger the group of \nusers, the higher the value of the product or service to each user. Examples include mobile and social networks. \n ", "2   \n \ninformation and low transparency. User demand for technology solutions is rarely \narticulated in a way that attracts interest from technology providers. This market \nfailure is even more acute for the Asia-Pacific\u2019s smaller and more remote markets. \nThe private sector has proven reluctant to invest there, as technology innovators \noften consider it easier to focus on larger and more mature markets. Those that \ndecide to venture into developing Asia-Pacific often face heightened market risks \nincluding opaque legal and regulatory frameworks. \n \n(iii)  Limited access to venture capital in emerging markets and impact sectors.4 \nSince 2015, venture capital (VC) investment flows to emerging markets in the Asia-\nPacific have reduced as investors focusses on later stage deals. VC portfolios tend \nto be concentrated in selected markets and sectors such as e-commerce. Impact \ninvesting is treated as a niche within the broader VC industry. The lack of risk capital \nis particularly acute for early-stage companies accessing smaller markets, more \nremote  geographic  areas,  companies  serving  public-sector  customers,  and \ninnovators in capital-intensive sectors. While there is a growing pool of \u2018patient\u2019 \ncapital from diversified sources including corporate VCs, social impact funds, \nfoundations, and family offices, these funding sources remain fragmented and \nstruggle with market insights and transparency. The angel investment ecosystem \nremains nascent in most emerging markets.5  \n \n5.  Strategy 2030 priorities and strong client demand. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 emphasizes \nthe importance of innovative technologies. This reflects ADB developing member countries\u2019 \nincreasing demand for technology solutions that contribute to more inclusive and sustainable \neconomic  growth.  Overcoming  the  emerging  market  challenges  currently  constraining  the \ndeployment and scaling of impactful technologies will require catalytic leadership to crowd in \ninvestors and innovators. ADB is uniquely poised to provide it. \n \n6.  Building  on  successful  pilots.  ADB  has  accumulated  knowledge,  expertise,  and \npartnerships by piloting new approaches to deploying and scaling impactful technologies and \nbusiness models in emerging markets. Since 2013, ADB has leveraged its convening power to \ninvolve government and industry in more than 15 accelerator programs across the Asia-Pacific.6 \nThese programs were operated in partnership with industry and have supported more than 100 \nearly-stage companies to deploy technology solutions in emerging markets. These activities have \ngenerated enormous visibility and increased demand for ADB support.7 Key lessons include: \n(i) take a country-specific approach and build-on and expand the existing innovation ecosystem; \n(ii) involve industry and end-users upfront to ensure \u2018demand pull\u2019 for technology solutions; and \n(iii) leverage ADB\u2019s existing government and corporate networks to help deploy and scale \nsolutions (Linked Document 2). \n \nB.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n7.  Impact and outcome. The TA will generate impact by catalyzing risk capital investment \ntowards the identification, deployment and scaling of impactful technology and business solutions \nthat contribute to the SDGs in the Asia-Pacific. The outcome will be operationalization of the ADB \nVentures Facility (Linked Document 1 and 3). \n                                                \n4   www.cbinsights.com. \n5   An angel investor is an affluent individual who provides capital to a startup, usually in exchange for ownership equity. \n6   Under: (i) Mekong Business Initiative, a TA program supported by the Government of Australia (www.mekongbiz.org), \nand (ii) Promotion of Investment in Climate Technology Products through Venture Capital Funds (Subproject 1).  \n7   2,000 positive media stories and 5 million social media shares tracked (www.coveragebook.com).  \n ", "  3 \n \n8.  ADB Ventures Facility. The Facility will support the deployment and scaling of impactful \ntechnologies and business models through capacity and funding: local startups that are taking \nproduct to market, and technology companies attempting to expand into new markets. The Facility \nwill have two components:  \n \n(i)  Business Support Program (indicative $10 million TA for 2020-2022, of which \nADB will seek cofinancing commitments of $5 million) with two tracks: \n \na.  Startup  Support  Program  \u2013  ADB  Ventures  will  partner  with  existing \naccelerators  to  identify  and  support  local  startups  with  SDG-related \nsolutions.8 ADB will incentivize partner accelerators and startups with a \nholistic support package that includes funding, industry expertise, access to \nADB  networks,  and  potential  follow-on  investment  funding  (Linked \nDocument 4). ADB Ventures will also build the capacity of angel investor \nnetworks to support impactful startups. \n   \nb.  Market Expansion Support Program \u2013 Building on existing ADB and other \npartner platforms, ADB Ventures will convene and work with regulators, \nmunicipalities,  and  large  corporates  to  build  consensus  on  problem \nstatements that represent commercial opportunities to technology solution \nproviders and opportunities for SDG impact. ADB will then identify and \nsupport proven global technology solution providers to adapt and deploy \nsolutions in the developing Asia-Pacific (Linked Document 4).9    \n  \n(ii)  ADB Ventures Investment Fund. ADB is currently seeking funding commitments \nof at least $40 million in order to establish and operationalize a trust fund to invest \n8-12 year catalytic capital in early-stage companies (indicatively seed to pre- Series \nB). The fund\u2019s target investees are envisaged as companies that: (i) emerge from \nthe ADB Ventures business support program; (ii) are co-invested with commercial \ninvestors  (including  VCs,  corporates,  social  impact  funds,  foundations,  family \noffices, and angel investors); and (iii) benefit from ADB\u2019s technical additionality \n(para 11). The fund would target financial sustainability and recycle such profits as \nmay be derived from investments back into the fund. This multi-donor fund would \nconsider a variety of instruments suitable for early-stage companies including both \nequity and quasi-equity. The investment strategy and specific funding instruments \nto be deployed will be determined by market diagnostics that determine funding \ngaps in targeted geographies and industries (output 2). ADB would be the investor-\nof-record  for  the  fund\u2019s  investments.  Approval  for  the  establishment  and \nadministration of this fund will be sought separately once fund-raising discussions \nhave resulted in the necessary commitments by third party donors.  \n \n9.  Differentiated country approach. Given the significant variation in progress towards the \nSDGs and the innovation ecosystem development across the Asia-Pacific, the Facility will tailor \nits approach to the unique challenges of each country. The business support program will place \na greater emphasis on startup support in underdeveloped innovation ecosystems. \n                                                \n8   An accelerator in an entity that provides business support services to early-stage companies to help them grow more \nquickly, normally in return for a fee and/or equity stake; an accelerator program is a program that gives early-stage \ncompanies access to mentorship, investors and other support that help them become viable businesses.  \n9  Structures will be established to ensure ADB funding support only for entities with impactful technologies and \nbusiness models that promote SDG impact in the developing ADB member countries, and not directly benefit solution \nproviders from non-ADB member countries. \n ", "4   \n \n10.  Gender inclusion approach. The startup support program in each country will include a \nfemale entrepreneurship award earmarked for a startup with a female co-founder. The market \nexpansion support program will prioritize gender inclusion themes in which at least 50% of the \nbeneficiaries are female. The ADB Ventures investment fund will apply a gender inclusion lens to \nall investment activities by systematically considering the benefits to females and will actively \nseek to catalyze and co-invest with impact funds that target women-owned businesses.    \n \n11.  ADB additionality. With a $102 billion portfolio by the end of 2017 and strong networks \nof governments, corporates, and knowledge institutions, ADB has unique convening power, \nexpertise, and resources to crowd technology and investment into emerging markets. Technical \nadditionality includes: (i) strong government relationships and industry expertise, (ii) regional \nconvening  power,  (iii)  operation  at  scale  with  critical  mass  to  sustain  long-term  strategic \nengagement, and (iv) honest broker role to foster industry collaboration. Financial additionality \nincludes: (i) provision of longer-term patient capital, and (ii) credibility of ADB brand that can \ncrowd-in impact investors. \n \n12.  Outputs. The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Output and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Key Activities \n1.

The TA is estimated to cost $3,000,000, of which (i) $2,600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($400,000 \u2013 TASF-6 and $2,200,000 \u2013 TASF-\nOther sources), and (ii) $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Technology Fund \nto be administered by ADB. Cost estimates and financing arrangements are in Appendix 1. \n ", "  5 \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented between October 2018 and December 2020. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency and PSOD will be the implementing agency for the TA. PSOD has mobilized \nstaff and consultants with relevant expertise. PSOD will adopt a One ADB approach, working \nclosely with the ADB\u2019s regional and knowledge departments to leverage ADB\u2019s government \nrelationships, operational networks, and industry domain knowledge. The fundraising exercise is \ncurrently being coordinated with ADB\u2019s Office of Co-Financing Operations. \n \n15.  Partnerships. The Government of Australia has been a key knowledge partner through \nits funding of the Mekong Business Initiative (MBI) technical assistance. The ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia Department and PSOD collaborated closely under MBI. ADB Ventures will build on the \nbusiness support programs piloted under MBI.  During the design and implementation of the \nFacility, ADB will seek out new partners, including: (a) innovation partners that will partner with \nADB to implement the business support programs; (b) knowledge partners that will provide \nresources to ADB to help design and operationalize the Facility; and (c) funding partners, both \nco-financiers of the Facility as well as potential co-investors after the fund is operationalized. \n \n16.  Consulting Services. Under this TA, ADB will also engage 5 near full-time individual \nconsultants (2 international for 32 person-months, 3 national for 57 person-months) and short-\nterm consultants (an estimated 24 person-months of international/regional consultant inputs) \nusing the individual consultant selection process to ensure quality during the recruitment. ADB \nwill hire one consulting firm (an estimated 12 person-months) for public relations using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method. Terms of reference are in Linked Document 5. ADB will engage \nthe consultants and firm following ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand its associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. The TA resources \nwill be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). Disbursements from the two funding sources will be based on the \nappropriate usage purposes as determined by ADB. \n \n17.  Pilot testing. ADB Ventures will seek to tap into pilot-testing resources including the ADB \nHigh-Level Technology Fund while also setting aside $900,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund funding for pilot-testing of impactful technologies and business models that emerge \nfrom business support programs. Details of the transparent, competitive, and fair screening \nprocess are detailed in Linked Document 4.  \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding \nthe equivalent of $400,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Clean Technology Fund, and \n(ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,600,000 on a grant basis for \n \nthe preparation for the ADB Ventures Facility, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n__ October 2018              Takehiko Nakao \nPresident \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nClean \nTechnology \nItem  ADBa  Fundb  Total \n1.
