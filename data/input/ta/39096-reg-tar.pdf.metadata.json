The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) program of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \naims to foster a more integrated regional market, the growth of regional institutions, and an \nincreased capacity for collective action for common, regional public goods. The objectives are to \nheighten (i) connectivity (ii) competitiveness; and (iii) sense of community among the GMS \ncountries. One of the 11 flagship undertakings is private/business sector development through \nenhanced  participation  and  competitiveness  (Flagship  7).  According  to  the  GMS  regional \ncooperation and strategy program (RCSP) for 2004\u20132008, important progress has been made \nin this regard, but the private sector in much of the subregion is still in its infancy (para. 93).  \n \n2.  As private sector development is widely recognized as crucial for both economic growth \nand  poverty  reduction,  the  GMS  governments  have  sought  ADB\u2019s  help  in  promoting \nprivate/business sector development through this regional technical assistance (RETA),1 to \ncapture synergies among the GMS countries.2 Consultations in May\u2013September 2005 reached \na consensus on the RETA design. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although the level of poverty in GMS is still high, the region has made considerable \nprogress in economic development. Total exports have increased, from about $35 billion in \n1992 to more than $81 billion in 2002. Foreign direct investment almost tripled during the same \nperiod  as  well.  Much  of  the  recent  growth  has  been  attributed  to  private/business  sector \ndevelopment.  As  a  general  trend,  the  private/business  sector  has  been  increasing  its \ncontribution to economic growth and poverty reduction (through employment generation) in \ncomparison with the public/state-owned enterprise sector. \n \n4.  However, despite the importance of policies for enabling business environments, the \nGMS  countries  continue  to  face  considerable  difficulties  in  formulating,  implementing  and \nevaluating these. In Cambodia, a manufacturing enterprise typically has to pay almost $2,000 in \nlicensing-related fees. In Viet Nam, enterprises have to wait up to 1 year to receive their \ncertificates of land use rights. In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), business \nregistration may take up to 9 months because of various requirements at both central and local \nlevels. Thailand has made considerable progress over the last decade but also needs further \nreform,  particularly  in  streamlining  the  legal  framework  for  business.  Some  of  the  major \nchallenges facing the region are outlined below.   \n \n5.  Incomplete Understanding of the Impact of Policies on the Business Environment. \nSeveral studies and donor-assisted projects have surveyed the business environment in the \nGMS countries. These major studies and surveys include: (i) Doing Business Survey by the \nWorld Bank; (ii) survey for the Competitiveness Yearbook by the International Institute for \nManagement Development; (iii) Investment Climate Survey by both ADB and the World Bank; \n(iv)  Business  Environment  and  Enterprise  Performance  Survey  by  the  World  Bank  and \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development; (v) private sector assessments in specific \ncountries by ADB; and (vi) recommendations from various private sector forums. These studies \nand  surveys  have  helped  identify  the  major  challenges  associated  with  the  business \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 19 September 2005.   \n2  The RETA is expected to cover the following GMS countries: (i) Cambodia, (ii) Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \n(iii) Thailand, and (iv) Viet Nam. The RETA will also delineate the experiences of the other GMS economies to the \nextent possible. ", " 2   \nenvironment, by gathering information directly from firms. However, the causes of the policy, \nlegal, and regulatory challenges facing businesses are still not clearly understood.3 Although \nmany of the challenges are believed to be due to the governments\u2019 policies (as reflected in laws \nand  regulations),  the specific  policies  that  impede  business  still  need  to  be identified  and \nanalyzed. Such analyses will not only indicate where reforms are needed but will also provide \nbaseline data for monitoring the progress of reforms. \n \n6.  Lack of Indicators for Benchmarking and Policy Monitoring. An important obstacle \nis the lack of baseline data and indicators4 for the major policies that affect the business \nenvironment. Even Thailand, where the business environment has considerably improved in the \nlast decade, has no such indicators. Without these indicators, it is difficult for governments to \nbenchmark policy performance and monitor policy reforms. \n \n7.  Lack  of  Capacity  to  Develop  and  Maintain  Indicators.  Besides  developing \nperformance indicators for policy reform, there is a clear need to publicize the indicators and to \nbuild capacity and promote ownership. Capacity-building programs will help ensure that in the \nfuture the governments can refine and update the indicators on their own. Finally, sharing of \nexperience and knowledge within the GMS as part of the overall capacity building heightens the \nsense of connectivity within the region. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The key priority is improving the business environment  by reforming the regulatory \nframework and drafting policies that will facilitate private sector development. Although the GMS \ngovernments are committed to enhancing the business environment, they lack the necessary \ntools to formulate, implement, and evaluate the needed policies and institutions. These tools \ninclude: (i) detailed analysis of the impact of policies on the business environment; (ii) regularly \nupdated  monitoring  indicators  of  the  performance  of  major  policy  components;  and \n(iii) sustainable  mechanisms  for  implementing,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  the  policies  and \nreforms, with support and feedback from the private sector.  \n \n9.  The regional approach is appropriate since the GMS countries have similar constraints \non private sector development. As indicated in the RCSP, and in particular for the post-conflict \nor  transitional  economies  of  Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  and  Viet  Nam,  the  most  important \ndeficiencies are in enforcing property rights and establishing effective commercial legal and \ninstitutional systems. Other important common challenges are: (i) limitations in governance and \npublic administration leading to overregulation of business; (ii) lack of capacity of governments \nto provide effective services to enterprises; (iii) limited mechanisms for effective public-private \nconsultation in policy formulation/evaluation; and (iv) absence of data collection mechanisms for \npolicy evaluation.  \n \n                                                 \n3  The surveys indicate the \u201coutcome\u201d of the challenges facing the business environment by estimating the costs, \ntime, and number of procedures that various regulations entail, and the business forums provide important \nrecommendations and possible solutions to the problems that beset businesses. But neither the surveys nor the \nforums identify the \u201csources\u201d of the challenges, particularly the policy sources. Without a full understanding of these \nspecific policy sources, the governments cannot effectively reform the business environment.   \n4  For this RETA, the \u201cindicators\u201d are not necessarily quantitative rankings but refer to baseline data and information \nthat would allow comparisons between countries and the tracking of progress made by each country through time. \nSuch baseline data are a prerequisite for establishing performance indicators to monitor and measure progress on \nthe policy reform agenda. \n ", "3 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  Overall,  the  RETA  is  expected  to  improve  the  business  environment  in  the  GMS \ncountries by developing policy indicators on the business environment that can be monitored. \nThe indicators will be used to analyze the performance and business impact of major policies \nand regulations, and will also allow the GMS countries to benchmark against one another and \nthus make use of one another\u2019s experiences.5 The sharing of experiences and lessons, as well \nas capacity building to encourage ownership of the indicators and the intended reforms by the \ngovernments, will be important in achieving the expected results. \n \n11.  This RETA is designed to produce defined outputs and outcomes. The impact of policies \non the business environment in the GMS will become clearer and more readily comparable. The \nRETA will achieve this outcome through its expected outputs. First, the impact of major policies \n(as reflected in laws and regulations) on business in the GMS countries will be analyzed and \nevaluated with the help of monitoring indicators developed in the RETA. The indicators and the \nanalysis will be published. The analysis should assist the governments in developing more \neffective  policies  and  institutions  to  promote  private  sector  development.  The  measurable \nindicators will also help ADB analyze the performance of certain projects.6 \n \n12.  Second,  there  will  be  extensive  consultation  and  capacity  building,  to  promote \ngovernment ownership of the indicators, which must be regularly updated (either yearly or every \nother year). A specific role will be identified for private sector representatives (both foreign and \ndomestic business associations) and their active participation will be encouraged. Workshops \nfor this purpose are planned during the RETA. \n \n13.  Finally, the RETA will promote regional dialogue among key policy makers and with \nmajor donor agencies. Through the regional dialogue the GMS countries can learn key lessons \nfrom  one  another.  As  the  GMS  countries  have  already  made  some  important  efforts  to \nstrengthen their business climate, as noted above, opportunities to exchange such lessons will \nbe a critical component of the RETA. Accordingly, the RETA will sponsor regional conferences, \nand will also consider the role of the GMS Business Forum in this dialogue.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The primary output of the RETA will be a publication, The Business Environment in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion, a thorough analysis based on measurable indicators for the private \nsector in the GMS countries covered by the RETA. A draft outline of the publication is in \nAppendix 2. The RETA will build the necessary capacity in the GMS governments to update the \n                                                 \n5  Several countries have been using such indicators to measure the effectiveness of regulations. In Australia, the \nindicators  have  led  to  assessments  of  the  impact  of  regulations  on  business  licenses.  In  Mexico,  various \nregulations have been streamlined with the help of the indicators. In the United States, the Small Business \nAdministration analyzes local (state) government regulations.  \n6  The relevant projects include the various small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) projects in the Mekong region: \n(i) ADB. 2004.Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Program.

Manila and (iii) ADB. \n2004. Technical Assistance to Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Preparing the Private Sector Development \nProgram. Manila In addition, there are also a number of financial sector development projects in the region as well. \nThese projects represent an important source of information on the business environment for the RETA. \n ", " 4   \nanalysis/indicators regularly. Workshops and regional conferences will also be held to publicize \nthe findings and increase awareness of the need for private sector development. \n \n15.  The RETA will start the analysis of the GMS business environment by identifying the \nmajor  milestones  that  firms  must  achieve  from  start-up  (business  registration,  receipt  of \noperating license) to improved competitiveness (export growth, technology development).7 In \nthe process, the RETA will also map the business environment, using the surveys and studies \nmentioned above, and then develop indicators of policy impact. The major milestones8 would \ninclude: (i) business start-up (business registration); (ii) access to labor, finance, and physical \nresources such as land; (iii) operating and regulatory licensing; (iv) taxation; (v) access to \nphysical resources such as infrastructure and energy; (vi) enforcement of investor/property \nrights and contracts; and (vii) access to import and export markets. As far as possible, the \nmilestones must closely reflect the findings of the firm-level surveys. \n \n16.  Key activities throughout the RETA will be regional workshops and conferences, as well \nas country-specific activities, to disseminate the findings and raise awareness of the importance \nof improving the business environment. Consensus on the schedule and work programs of the \nRETA is expected to be developed at an inception conference.9 Throughout the RETA, the \nfindings and discussions will be linked with those of other, ongoing GMS activities, including the \nGMS Business Forum. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The RETA will cost about $500,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $300,000 on a grant \nbasis from its TA funding program, and the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China will \nprovide $200,000 also on a grant basis, to be administered by ADB. The cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the proposed RETA. The Governance, Finance, \nand Trade Division of ADB\u2019s Mekong Regional Department will take the lead in the RETA \nimplementation, in coordination with the Operation and Coordination Division. The proposed \nRETA is expected to begin in January 2006  and will last for about 10 months. Over the \nimplementation period, international consultants will be required for 10 person-months, and \ndomestic consultants for 45 person-months. Appendix 4 gives outline terms of reference for \nthese consultants. The consultants will be recruited individually, according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and \nhiring of consultants. Procurement under the RETA will be according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. The computers and other office equipment to be purchased under the RETA will \nbe disposed under ADB guidelines after the RETA. \n \n                                                 \n7  For  the  purposes  of  this  RETA,  competitiveness  is  defined  by  productivity.  Export  growth  and  technology \ndevelopment (as measured by the increase in the value of products) are common indicators of competitiveness.  \n8  As the business sector has many subsectors, the RETA will concentrate mainly on the major issues facing the \ndomestic (small- and medium-sized enterprise) sector and the foreign-invested sector.  \n9  The inception conference is expected to be held in Thailand. The arrangements for other conferences and \nworkshops will be finalized in consultation with the stakeholders. The country-specific workshops are primarily \nintended to build the capacity of government officials and other stakeholders to maintain and further develop the \nindicators in the future. \n ", "5 \n19.  The main focal-point agencies10 in the four GMS countries are the Council for the \nDevelopment of Cambodia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lao PDR, the Office of the National \nEconomic  and  Social  Development  Board  of  Thailand,  and  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nInvestment  of  Viet  Nam.  These  main  agencies  will  be  supported  by  the  following:  (i) in \nCambodia, the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy, Ministry of Commerce, and Ministry of \nEconomy and Finance; (ii) in Lao PDR, the Ministry of Industry and Handicraft, Ministry of \nCommerce, Department for Domestic and Foreign Investment (Committee for Planning and \nInvestment), and Ministry of Finance; (iii) in Thailand, the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of \nFinance, Board of Investments, and Ministry of Industry; and (iv) in Viet Nam, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment will be the main counterpart agency, in coordination with the Ministry \nof Finance, the State Bank of Viet Nam, and other concerned agencies.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved \n(i) ADB\u2019s  administering  a  portion  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$200,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China; \nand (ii) ADB\u2019s providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis, \nfor Enhancing the Business Environment of the Greater Mekong Subregion, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                 \n10  In addition to the government agencies, leading private sector representatives (both domestic and foreign business \nassociations) will be nominated to participate in the RETA.

The work plan and consultant selection may be refined by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to suit its needs and those of the government agencies in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) countries. All consulting inputs are envisioned to be intermittent. The consultants (led by \nthe  team  leader)  will  draft  a  detailed  work  program  at  the  start  of  the  regional  technical \nassistance (RETA).  \n \n2.  The RETA will comprise three phases. Throughout each phase, the RETA will consult \nwith the governments and other key stakeholders, including major private sector representatives \nand donor agencies.  \n \n(i)  The  first  phase  will  concentrate  mainly  on  a  detailed  analysis  of  the  GMS \nbusiness environment (including a full diagnostic review of various surveys and \nstudies).
