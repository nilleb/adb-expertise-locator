In  February  2011,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  a  $1  billion \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to fund operational improvements for urban water supply \nduring 2011\u20132020.1 The MFF provides access to financing to many water companies to help \nthem improve their operations and expand their water supply systems, including intake works, \nproduction transmission, and distribution.2 The facility addresses water as a limiting factor for \ngrowth and inclusiveness by expanding water supply services to peri-urban areas, ultimately \nincreasing competitiveness and assisting the transformation of cities and towns to keep pace \nwith rapid urbanization. This capacity development technical assistance (TA) is being processed \nin parallel with the MFF to help the Government of Viet Nam improve water supply services.3 \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  In 2007, the government formulated a progressive legal framework4 that requires water \ncompanies to equitize5 and operate on business principles that would improve their performance. \nThe  government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan,  2011\u201320156 includes  water  sector \nobjectives:  (i)  identify  water  as  a  limiting  factor  of  growth,  and  support  local  economic \ndevelopment by developing modern urban infrastructure, and (ii) improve the quality of life and \nhealth of people by providing access to safe water. The country program for the water sector in \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132015 for Viet Nam is consistent with these policies.7  \n \n3.  The  TA  aims  to  build  capacity  in  selected  water  companies  to  operate  on  sound \nbusiness  principles  in  order  to  efficiently  fulfill  their  service  obligations  and  establish  a \npartnership with the private sector on a voluntary basis. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Viet  Nam  has  reached  the  Millennium  Development  Goal  7.C  target  to  halve  the \nproportion of people without access to safe water by 2015. With rapid population growth and as \nthe country transitions to become part of the global economy, the government recognizes the \nneed  to  improve  water  sector  efficiency  to  meet  the  increasing  demand  for  water.8 The \nresponsibility for urban infrastructure financing and operation rests with local governments. The \nlegal framework (footnote 4) enables local governments and water companies to increase tariffs \nto full cost recovery with an allowance for subsidies.9 However most local governments lack the \ncapacity to manage the complexity of water services. Considerable capacity building is needed \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Water Sector Investment Program. Manila. \n2  Sixteen water companies (Bac Giang Province, Binh Duong Province, Buon Ma Thuot City (three subprojects), Da \nNang City, Hai Phong City, Ho Chi Minh City, Lam Don Province (two subprojects), Quang Nam Province, Nghe An \nProvince (three subprojects), Nghi Son, Thai Nguyen Province, and Thue Thien Hue Province are borrowing under \nthe first two tranches of the MFF. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2012. \n4  Decree No. 117/2007/ND-CP: Clean Water Production, Supply and Consumption, supplemented by Decree \n124/2011/ND-CP: Amendments and Supplements to a Number of Articles of Decree 117/2007/ND-CP. \n5  A privatization process, in which provincial state-owned water companies are corporatized and incorporated into \ncompanies, operating under commercial law, either as one member limited company or as joint stock company. \n6  Ministry of Planning and Investment.

The  TA  will  contribute  to  the  capacity  development  of  selected  water  companies \nborrowing under the MFF to improve service to users, specifically targeting improved business \nplanning and financial sustainability, nonrevenue water (NRW) reduction, energy efficiency, and \nwater safety plans.10 The TA will assist water companies define service contracts with local \ngovernments (as owners of the water companies and regulators of the water services) and \nusers. The service contracts will include qualitative and quantitative key performance indicators, \ndefined in the business plan, as a basis for regulation by contract, in the absence of an \nindependent  regulator.  The  TA  will  assist  in  strengthening  the  corporatization  process  to \nincrease the accountability and performance of water companies, and to enable private sector \nparticipation in different forms, including PPPs. The TA will build capacity at the level of (i) \ngovernment and water companies to support the design and implementation of the  National \nNRW  Reduction  Program,11 which  defines  ambitious  targets12 for  NRW reduction from the \ncurrent national average of 30% and, (ii) the local government and water companies to support \nfinancial sustainability, through water tariff increases and the enforcement of the legislation.13 \n \n6.  The TA supplements ongoing efforts by development partners in the water sector. ADB \nhas successfully moved financing for water supply from ADB's Special Funds concessional \nlending terms to the ordinary capital resources LIBOR-based lending facility, as a prelude to \nprivate sector and commercial financing. Japan initiated a large public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \nprogram in Viet Nam. The World Bank is assisting the government in several cities through \nwater supply and sanitation investments, mostly funded by concessional loans. Through grants, \nFinland  is  supporting  water  supply  and  sewerage  projects  in  small  towns  in  the  northern \nprovinces.  The  ADB  project  team  for  the  TA  is  coordinating  with  the  Water  Operators \nPartnership Program (managed by ADB) to strengthen water companies through twinning and \nadditional capacity building. The TA supports the implementation of water safety plans by the \nWorld  Health  Organization  and  Business  Management  Training  for  Managers  of  Water \nCompanies financed by Partners for Water (Netherlands) with the Viet Nam Water Supply and \nSewerage Association, to ensure the relevance of the TA to Viet Nam\u2019s water sector. \n \n7.  The ADB Water Operational Plan, 2011\u20132020 focuses on the theme of water security.14 \nImproving water security for a rapidly growing population requires the efficient use of available \nwater resources and effective demand management. The ADB assessment, strategy, and road \nmap for Viet Nam\u2019s water supply and sanitation underscores the importance of efficiency gains \nand the private sector in bridging the water supply\u2013demand gap.15  \n \n8.  The TA will assist the government and the water companies in developing capacity for \nplanning,  regulating,  and  providing  water  supply  services.  The  TA  will  also  provide  the \ninstruments needed to assess the performance and the monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the \n                                                \n10  Water safety plans, initiated in Viet Nam by the World Health Organization and financed by the Australian Agency \nfor International Development are implemented under the MFF and supported by the Ministry of Construction. \n11  Decision No. 2147/2010/QD-TTg on Approval of National Unaccounted for Water and NRW Reduction Program to \n2025.

Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be an improved institutional framework for water supply services in Viet \nNam. The outcome will be improved business practices of selected water companies, serving as \nbest practice examples for the Viet Nam water sector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The overall objectives of the TA are to improve the performance of water supply services \nand  to  make  water  companies  more  accountable  and  efficient.  Capacity  development  will \nsupport new investment made in water supply, particularly by the MFF. The TA will have three \nspecific  targets,  which  are  linked  to  three  outputs:  (i)  promote  policies  through  capacity \ndevelopment of the water companies to ensure the operation using sound business principles, \nand to enable a business environment conducive to partnerships with the private sector; (ii) \nsupport the government in implementing the National NRW Reduction Program (footnote 13), \nthrough pilot program, that will be upscaled in subsequent tranches of the MFF; and (iii) train \ngovernment  agencies  in  establishing  and  maintaining  effective  M&E,  particularly  the  water \nprogram financed under the MFF.  \n \n11.  The TA will assist water companies in formulating business plans, service contracts, and \nNRW reduction plans. The experience gained through TA implementation will be consolidated in \nproposals comprising contract and business plan templates, planning guidelines for NRW and \nwater conservancy, and generic procedures for operation and maintenance.  \n \n12.  The TA has three separate but interlinked outputs. \n(i)  Output  1:  Improved  performance  and  accountability  of  selected  water \ncompanies. Up to three water companies will be selected to prepare business \nplans and establish service contracts with local governments (owners) for the \nbenefit of users. The contracts will outline the level of service, and target 5\u201310  \nkey performance indicators from benchmarking to ensuring a sound regulation by \ncontract. The water companies will each set up a customer service department; \nmonitor  complaints;  report  business  performance  to  users;  and  implement \npolicies for water safety plans, energy efficiency, NRW, and asset management. \nThe  TA  will  support  selected  water  companies  to  implement  international \naccounting  standards,  to  increase  private  sector  participation  through  PPP, \nobtain a credit rating, and transition from a one-member limited company to a \njoint stock company with possible public listings to access the capital market to \nfinance additional capital expenditure. The TA will help the central and local \ngovernments  better  understand  options  available  in  setting  and  enforcing \nappropriate tariffs in exchange for improved operations and increased level of \nservice by the water companies.  \n(ii)  Output  2:  Introduction  of  pragmatic  procedures  for  implementing  the \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nNational Nonrevenue Water Reduction Program. The TA will initiate activities \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "4 \nto define adequate methodologies for the National NRW Reduction Program.16 \nUp  to  three  water  companies17 will  be  selected  to  pilot  the  National  NRW \nReduction Program to define a model feasibility study report for financing through \nofficial  development  assistance  or  PPP.  The TA  will  review  options for  cost \nrecovery mechanisms to finance the National NRW Reduction Program for the \ncentral and local governments and water companies.  \n(iii)  Output 3: Support for monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for water \nsupply services in Viet Nam. Availability and access to reliable information on \nthe system is a critical requirement for implementation of the MFF water sector \ninvestment program. The TA is an integral part of ADB support to establish M&E \nmechanisms for the water sector, using the water companies financed as pilots \nunder  the  MFF.  The  TA  will  develop  M&E  indicators,  based  on  the  project \nmanagement implementation system from the project administration manual of \nthe water companies financed under the first and second tranches of the MFF. \nThe  TA  will  assist  MPI,  the  MFF  coordinating  agency,  in  managing \nimplementation and coordinating with line ministries and agencies involved in the \nwater sector, such as the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Finance, Office of \nGovernment, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment, and State Bank of Viet Nam.  \n \n13.  In order to implement the three outputs, the TA will focus its activities at three levels:  \n(i)  Water companies. Activities include capacity development to (a) provide direct \nassistance for formulating business plans and annual forecasts; (b) define the \ncontents and key performance indicators for service contracts; and (c) promote \nunderstanding  of  the  concept  and  implications  of  a  service  contract,  the \nobligations of service delivery, and asset management.  \n(ii)  Provincial government. Capacity building activities to (a) clarify the role of the \nprovincial people\u2019s committees as the \u2015client\u2016 in service contracts with water \nsupply  companies;  (b)  support  the  people\u2019s  committees  in  assuming  their \nresponsibility as regulator; (c) monitor technical and financial performance; and \n(d) ensure that water companies are fulfilling their obligations in terms of water \nsupply, that meets government standards 24 hours a day at adequate pressure. \n(iii)  Central  government.  Activities  include  the  training  of  agencies  and  line \nministries  to:  (a)  consolidate  experience  with  the  water  company  service \ncontracts  and  business  planning  process  into  (draft)  national  guidelines  and \nfuture  training  programs;  and  (b)  identify  the  issues  and  requirements  for \nimproving water supply services in coordination with the Ministry of Construction, \nwhich  oversees  urban  water  supply;  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF),  which \noversees government pricing and lending policies; and the Ministry of Planning \nand  Investment  (MPI),  as  the  coordinating  agency  for  the  MFF  and  water \ncompanies under the Viet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association.  \n \n14.  The two recently equitized water companies, Quang Tri Water Company (QTWC) and \nDak Lak Water  Company will be selected for the first TA output, as proposed during the \nmanagement review meeting for the second tranche of the MFF to provide additional support. \nOther water companies for Output 1 and 2 will be selected by ADB in collaboration with the \nimplementing agency and the line Ministries. The TA builds on MFF experience with project \n                                                \n16 Based  on  ADB.  2010.  The  Issues  and  Challenges  of  Reducing  Non-Revenue  Water.

Lessons  from  the  MFF  highlight  the  need  to  define  key \nperformance indicators to be monitored. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,250,000, of which $1,100,000 equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nspace, counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency and QTWC will be the implementing agency. QTWC is \ncorporatized and fully owned by the Quang Tri Provincial Peoples Committee (QTPPC). In the last \n10 years, QTWC and QTPPC benefitted from several donors funded projects, including Mekong \nWater and Sanitation Program with UN-Habitat, Second Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation \nProject under ADB (L1514-VIE) and the recently approved Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor \nTown Development Project (L2969-VIE) with ADB. QTWC is also borrowing under the second \ntranche of the MFF and was cleared by ADB for financial management and capacity procurement \nassessment. As implementing agency, QTWC will coordinate with the Ministry of Construction to \nimplement output 2 of the National NRW Reduction Program, and with MPI (the MFF coordinating \nagency) for output 3 on M&E for the MFF. Coordination will be bolstered by three stakeholder \nworkshops  that  will  present  and  discuss  major  project  outputs  and  policy  issues,  review  TA \nprogress, and provide direction for strategy formulation. The TA will also finance a workshop on \nwater safety planning in Viet Nam and selected workshops in the region within the budget allocated. \n \n17.  The TA will finance international consultants (estimated 36 person-months) and national \nconsultants  (52  person-months)  from  May  2013  to  December  2014.  ADB  will  recruit  all  the \nconsultants as individual consultants, in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The skills required under the TA are too broad to be \nprovided by one firm. Consultants must be specialized in business planning, service contracts, \nservice performance, finance and PPP, community participation, water safety plans, NRW, and \nM&E. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time) and be handed over to QTWC at TA completion. ADB will manage the \nrecruitment of consultants and procurement of equipment and seek QTWC\u2019s concurrence prior to \nrecruiting consultants or purchasing equipment. The TA outputs, including knowledge products and \nservices, will be disseminated to intended users through workshops, electronic reports, website \npublication, and other means to be specified in a knowledge dissemination and communication \nplan. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.
