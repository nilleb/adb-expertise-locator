Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is required to prepare a results-based \nlending (RBL) program for possible funding by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA will \n(i) work with the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (NHAR) to develop the RBL program design \nand management framework, (ii) develop the methodology and data collection plan for the \npoverty  focused  rural  road  development  plan  and  impact  evaluation,  (iii)  address  the  due \ndiligence requirements and program assessment needed for RBL, and (iv) build knowledge and \ncapacity in the executing agency (EA) to implement a RBL program. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The TA outputs will be conducted by individual consultants to undertake: \n \n(i)  RBL  program  design,  management,  and  assessment.  The  consultants \n(international, 4 person-months; national, 4 person-months) will be responsible \nfor coordinating the TA outputs and the actions of the consultant team, the EA \nand ADB and prepare and edit the TA final report. They will develop the design \nand  monitoring  framework  and  establish  appropriate  results  to  link  with \ndisbursements, leading to the development of disbursement linked-indicator (DLI) \nmatrix. The consultants will discuss and reach preliminary agreement with senior \nNHAR  officials  and  the  EA  on  the  (a)  program  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \ncomponents, and activities; (b) preliminary program expenditure analysis; and \n(c) problem tree and results chain, with proposed DLI matrix. They will also \n(a) conduct  a  stakeholder  analysis;  (b)  assess  the  program  implementation \narrangements; (c) prepare a program monitoring and evaluation plan linked to \nverification of the DLIs and any program actions; (d) prepare an integrated risk \nassessment  based  on  the  findings  of  the  various  fiduciary,  safeguards,  and \ntechnical assessments; and (e) prepare a program action plan to support the \ncapacity  building  and  risk  mitigation.  The  consultants  will  also  oversee  and \ncoordinate  the  overall  TA  outputs  to  ensure  that  all  the  assessments  are \nundertaken in accordance with ADB requirements for RBL. They will review the \ntechnical design of the RBL program to ensure that the initial program design is \ntechnically sound and meets all relevant standards for ADB financing under the \nRBL  modality.  The  consultants  will  have  preferably  at  least  15  years  of \nexperience in project management in the transport sector and a graduate degree \nin project management, engineering, finance or economics.

The  consultants  (international,  2  person-\nmonths; national, 2 person-months) will perform a comprehensive analysis of the \ncauses  of  poverty  in  the  project  area.  The  consultants  will  investigate  the \nrelationship between the anticipated rural road improvements and the range of \npoverty  reduction  benefits  anticipated  from  the  targeted  intervention.  The \nconsultants will develop the methodology and approach to conducting the impact \nevaluation  including  the  plan  for  collecting  baseline  data  and  comparator \nlocations;  prepare  the  evaluation  methodology  implementation  schedule  and \nTOR for impact evaluation consultants during implementation. The international \nand national poverty specialists will have a degree from the social sciences, be \nfamiliar with the PRC\u2019s established poverty reduction programs and available \ndata, and poverty impact analysis of transportation project in rural areas, and \nhave a minimum of 5 years relevant experience in the PRC.

A  PSSA  will  be \nconducted to confirm these categorizations, and schedule activities to assess the \nsafeguard systems and capacities, and identify mitigating or monitoring actions to \nguide program implementation. The PSSA will specify and recommend program \nactions needed to fill the gaps in safeguards requirements. The Program Action \nPlan (PAP) will include an environmental assessment and review framework \n(EARF) with sample EMP and GRM (multiple EMPs and GRMs may be prepared \nif necessary); resettlement framework with sample resettlement plan, and ethnic \nminority  development  plan.  A  single  GRM  could  be  prepared  for  both \nenvironmental and social safeguards. The consultants will conduct community \nconsultations  and  surveys,  identify  potential  social  risks  associated  with  the \nproject and help develop appropriate mitigation measures and include these in \nthe safeguards documents.  \n \n3.
