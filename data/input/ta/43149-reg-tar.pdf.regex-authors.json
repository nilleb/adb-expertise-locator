INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strengthening the procurement capacity of developing member countries (DMCs) is a \ncritical part of the work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on harmonization, alignment, \ngovernance, and improving aid effectiveness. ADB has participated in multilateral efforts to work \ntogether with partner governments on strengthening procurement practices and institutions.1  \n \n2.  In  August  2009,  ADB  hosted  a  consultative  meeting  (consultation)  to  canvass  with \nstakeholders  across  Asia  and  the  Pacific  on  the  possible  advantages  of  establishing  a \nprocurement forum or similar facility to promote informed policy dialogue and more effective \ninformation  exchange  on  internationally  acceptable  or  good  procurement  practices.  The \nconsultation  participants  concluded  that  an  approach  that  fosters  stronger  dialogue  and \ncollaboration among various stakeholders to support public procurement reform and related \nefforts of DMCs in Asia and the Pacific was needed and would benefit ADB\u2019s member countries, \ndevelopment partners, and civil society organizations (CSOs).2  \n \n3.  This regional technical assistance (TA)3  will provide financial and professional support \nto establish the Procurement Partnership Initiative (PPI). The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  BACKGROUND \n4.  Procurement is a critical consideration in achieving the effective and efficient delivery of \npublic services. It involves the management of a large amount of public funds and is the largest \nsingle cause behind allegations of corruption and government inefficiency. Weak procurement \npolicies and practices constrain development and waste scarce public funds. Efficient and \neffective  procurement  is  an  important  contributing  factor  to  the  achievement  of  superior \ndevelopment effectiveness results for ADB and its DMCs. While facing various challenges in \nachieving  their  procurement  reform  agenda,  ADB  member  countries,  through  the  Paris \nDeclaration,4  committed  to  developing  reliable  procurement  systems.5  Furthermore, \ndevelopment partners (including ADB) committed to promoting the use of country procurement \nby ensuring that applicable procurement procedures are transparent and fair and allow local, \nregional, and foreign firms to compete equally for aid-funded procurement.  \n \n5.  Procurement has been identified in the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action \nPlan (GACAP II)6 as a governance thematic priority that must be assessed at both country and \nsector levels to inform the preparation of the country partnership strategy. Procurement risks \nidentified in ADB priority sectors should thus inform the design of ADB programs and projects in \n                                                 \n1  The involvement  has  primarily  been  through  the  former  Joint  Venture  (now  Task  Force)  on  Procurement \nconstituted by the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD-DAC) in 2006. The OECD-DAC Task Force on Procurement is an international forum for \nprocurement specialists representing multilateral institutions, bilateral development agencies, and developing \ncountries engaged in procurement reform. Its mandate is to fulfill the procurement-related commitments of the \n2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness: to strengthen national procurement systems, to support capacity \ndevelopment, and to use country systems.  \n  Further details are available at www.oecd.org/dac/effectiveness/procurement  \n2  Further details are available at http://adbprocurementforum.net  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 April 2009. Concept clearance \nwas given on 12 March 2009. \n4  Declaration of the Second High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Paris in 2005 (Second High Level \nForum). \n5  See Indicator 2b of the Paris Declaration. \n6  ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan. Manila (IN216-06, 4 August). \n ", "2 \n \nthose sectors. This TA seeks to further ADB\u2019s commitments under the Second High Level \nForum, affirmed by the third High Level Forum,7 and GACAP II; and address the development \nconstraints posed by weak procurement, as identified in country partnership strategies.    \n \n6.  There is currently no facility in Asia and the Pacific to support public procurement \nreforms of DMCs that is able to mobilize financial and professional resources in a flexible and \neffective manner. By networking procurement policy officials, the proposed PPI will facilitate \npolicy dialogue, share experiences, identify common issues, and seek coordinated solutions to \nmove the public procurement systems of DMCs toward internationally accepted good practices. \nMoreover, as public procurement is closely linked to trade, a coordinated procurement policy \nenvironment will contribute to regional economic integration and growth.  \n \n          III.   RATIONALE \n \n7.  Increased country ownership. DMC governments need to have stronger ownership of \ntheir procurement reforms and policies, and engage with their parliaments and citizens to shape \nsuch policies. Development partners may then support the efforts of DMC governments by \ninvesting in their reform activities, keeping in mind that the right set of national institutions and \nhuman  resources  need  to  be  complemented  by  country  ownership  and  accountability.  A \nprocurement assistance facility in Asia and the Pacific can serve as a competitive, flexible, and \ntargeted funding modality that will bridge country-owned development efforts and development \npartner support toward achieving better results in the reform process. The facility can support \ndemand-driven, tailored, and coordinated capacity development activities, such as procurement \npolicy  advice,  implementation  support,  peer-to-peer  exchange,  research,  and  training  to \naccelerate ongoing procurement reform processes, depending on the need and commitment of \nthe DMC concerned. \n \n8.  Effective  information  exchange.  At  the  country  level,  and  on  a  voluntary  basis, \ndevelopment partners and DMCs should be able to monitor the implementation of internationally \naccepted  procurement  principles,  share  results  through  a  common  website,  and  identify \nsimilarities  and  differences\u2014all  for  the  purpose  of  enhancing  collaboration.  Existing  joint \nassessment tools that focus on the quality of country procurement systems could be used to \nmeasure the progress of reform programs that have been identified as eligible for capacity \ndevelopment assistance under the TA. Through establishment of a dynamic website, public \nprocurement  officials  and  interested  development  actors  will  be  connected  to  up-to-date \nregional and international good practice knowledge sources. The creation of this web-based \nnetwork will enhance development of peer-to-peer cooperation and collaboration within the \nregion on high-priority procurement issues, improve transparency, and inform development \ninterventions.  Finally,  sponsorship  of  periodic  regional  (and  subregional)  conferences  and \nworkshops on thematic issues and challenges, and promotion of focused policy dialogue under \nthe TA, will build momentum for and encourage country and subregional level reform initiatives. \n \n9.  More effective and inclusive partnerships. With increased information exchange and \ntransparency at country and subregional levels, the TA aims to build an open and coordinated \nplatform for sharing of good practice approaches and ways in which to improve and upgrade \ncountry procurement systems. Development of this type of collaborative and focused platform \nfor procurement officials, CSOs, the private sector, universities, research organizations, and \nother developments actors interested or involved in procurement regulatory and implementation \nreform and accountability will result in more effective and inclusive partnerships at both national \n                                                 \n7 Third High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness held in Accra in 2008, which declared the Accra Agenda for Action. \n ", "3 \n \nand regional levels. This, in turn, should promote more sustainable improvement in public \nprocurement management and governance in ADB DMCs.  \n  \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA broadly aims to assist in overall improvement of public sector governance in \nAsia and the Pacific.\u00a0The intended impact of the TA is that a significant number of participating \nADB DMCs will have undertaken initiatives to align their public procurement systems with \ninternational good practice. By the end of the TA implementation, the expected outcome is that \nan effective platform to strengthen regional (and subregional) exchange of information and \npartnership among public procurement officials in ADB DMCs is operational. \n \n11.  The TA will focus on developing collaborative initiatives between DMCs that promote \ninformed policy dialogue and enhanced knowledge and capacity in areas of importance to \nmeaningful procurement reform and implementation. Six critical subject areas under public \nprocurement for initial DMC focus were endorsed at the consultation: (i) assessing procurement \nsystems  and  evaluating  performance,  (ii)  developing  procurement  reform  strategies, \n(iii) strengthening  procurement  management,  (iv)  improving  procurement  execution, \n(v) procurement performance monitoring and oversight, and (vi) building procurement capacity.8   \n \n12.  Within this broad topical framework, consultation discussions identified the need for TA \ninterventions that are country-specific and deal with issues of practical importance to public \nprocurement authorities and officials, and that primarily focus on deepening the momentum of \nprocurement reform, institutional capacity building, and efficient project delivery. Consultation \nparticipants stridently articulated the need for TA to focus on ways to promote and improve the \ninstitutional  and  financial  independence  of  public  procurement  authorities,  to  increase \ntransparency and accountability in the procurement implementation and monitoring process, to \naddress the problem of continued corruption, and to encourage country-initiated procurement \nreform efforts.9\n \nB.  Key Activities   \n \n13.  Output  1.  Supporting  country-specific  procurement  reform  initiatives.  The \nProcurement Partnership Facility (PPF) will be established in the initial amount of $500,00010 to \nprovide  financial  support  to  implement  high  priority  procurement-related  project  proposals \ninitiated by DMCs. Over 3.5 years, the TA is expected to finance, among others, country-driven \nprocurement-related projects, but the exact number and value of projects financed under the \nPPF will depend on the relative merits of the project proposals submitted. In typical cases, the \ngovernment authority that is responsible for national procurement policies and reforms within \nthe DMC concerned will submit a proposal for the funding of pre-identified and priority activities \nin  its  procurement  reform  agenda.  ADB  will  invite  proposal  submissions  primarily  through \nposting on the PPI website and through electronic notification to website subscribers and other \npublic  procurement-related  networks.  This  information  will  also  be  disseminated  to  public \nprocurement  officials,  development  partners,  and  CSO  representatives  at  meetings, \n                                                 \n8T  hTeh evsieew ssu bejexcptr earsesaesd w heerere oinri gainrea lltyh oidseen toiffie tdh ea tc aonn seualrtlaienr tc aonnsdu dltaot inveo tm neeecteinsgs baeritlwy ereenp rDeMseCnst  athnods dee voef loApDmBe\u2019nst  \nmpeamrtbneerrss ,h Beloda inrd 2 o0f0 8D airte Dcthoarksa, ,M Baanngalgaedemsehn tht,a ot rw satsa sffp, oannsdo rmeda byy b teh ep Wreolirmldi nBaarnyk i.n  nature.  \n9  A summary of consultation questionnaire findings and major issues/challenges identified during the consultation \nbreakout sessions is available on request. \n10This indicative figure may be adjusted during TA implementation depending on DMC demand under the PPF. The \nPPF will be funded from Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources).  \n ", "4 \n \nconferences, and workshops; and by designated focal points at ADB resident missions to the \nextent possible. \n \n14.  ADB  Central  Operations  Services  Office  (COSO),  in  consultation  primarily  with  the \nrelevant regional department,11 will screen the proposal for approval, considering among other \nfactors,  (i)  responsiveness  to  any  country  procurement  assessment  that  may  have  been \nundertaken for the DMC concerned; (ii) consistency with the DMC\u2019s public procurement reform \nstrategy/agenda; (iii) government ownership of the proposal, including the nature and extent of \ncounterpart resources and support proposed for commitment to the project; (iv) the country \nprocurement assistance portfolio within and outside ADB; (v) the relative weakness or strength \nof  the  national  procurement  system  concerned;  and  (vi)  peer-to-peer  exchanges  and  the \ninvolvement of CSOs, among others.  The guidelines for proposal screening and approval will \nbe disseminated through the PPI website. \n \n15.       The PPF may fund and support the following types of activities, among others:  \n \n(i)  framing  procurement  reform  initiatives  and  strategies,  including  needed \nregulatory and operational reform; \n(ii)  developing policies and procedures to strengthen procurement management and \nperformance, including use of management information system, road maps, and \nbenchmarks; \n(iii)  strengthening the role of CSOs, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and the \nprivate sector through improved procurement transparency and accountability \nmechanisms; \n(iv)  developing  e-procurement,  public\u2013private  partnership,  and  other  specialized \nprocurement approaches, manuals, templates, road maps, tool kits, guidance \nnotes, and related documentation and knowledge resources; \n(v)  mainstreaming procurement performance monitoring and oversight through use \nof  procurement  audits  and  similar  efforts,  and  integration  of  independent \nmonitors such as CSOs and NGOs (e.g., Procurement Watch, Transparency \nInternational) in the public procurement process;  \n(vi)  assisting in assessment of country level procurement systems and evaluating \nperformance, including application of the Development Assistance Committee of \nthe  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD-DAC) \nbaseline and compliance performance indicators; \n(vii)  promoting  informed  policy  dialogue  on  issues  such  as  country  accession  to \ninternational commitments, e.g., the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) \nand the broader implications of GPA-driven country reforms; and \n(viii)  capacity building and training in other areas considered critical for promoting \ninternationally acceptable or good procurement practices.  \n \nAreas  of  focus  that  require  analytical  studies  and  research  under  the  PPF  may  also  be \nconsidered on a case-by-case basis. However, the primary focus of the PPF is to provide \nassistance to public procurement agencies that is practical and action-oriented, and driven by \ncountry-defined priorities to improve local regulatory frameworks and the quality of on-the-\nground procurement implementation.   \n \n                                                 \n11 The proposal selection committee will include a representative from COSO, the regional department (and/or, as \nappropriate, the resident mission concerned), and ADB Regional and Sustainable Development Department\u2019s \nCapacity  Development,  Disaster  Risk  Management  and  Civil  Society  Participation  Division.  The  selection \ncommittee will finalize the detailed selection criteria and approval procedure for PPF proposals. \n ", "5 \n \n16.  Output  2.  Procurement  knowledge  products  and  online  support.  The  TA  will \ndevelop and maintain a dynamic website (based on Web2 technology)\u2014public procurement \ninformation  exchange  and  knowledge  products  website\u2014to  provide  an  online  platform  for \ninformation  exchange  and  networking  among  public  procurement  officials,  development \npartners, and others interested in public procurement reform and implementation. Important TA \nactivities and results will be published online to provide a platform for peer-to-peer exchanges \namong public procurement professionals in participating DMCs and other stakeholders. A needs \nsurvey will be undertaken to clarify the most important priorities for targeted website users and \nto rationalize allocation of web-based resources. \n \n17.  The TA will sponsor targeted research and analytical studies, including country case \nstudies, to support informed policy dialogue and DMC reform and implementation strategies on \nissues  and  challenges  in  public  procurement  identified  by  participating  DMCs,  CSOs,  and \nothers,  either  as  stand-alone  assignments  or,  if  adequately  justified,  as  part  of  proposed \nprojects to be funded under the PPF. The results of such studies and research will be posted \nonline and be publicly available. \n     \n18.  Output 3. Procurement officials in region share good procurement practices. To \nsupport informed policy dialogue and sharing of experiences among DMC policy makers and \nprocurement  practitioners,  the  TA  will  sponsor  two  regional  conferences  during  TA \nimplementation and up to eight subregional meetings/workshops in coordination with existing \nregional and subregional initiatives\u2014regional and subregional public procurement dialogue\u2014as \nwell as participation in other public procurement-related knowledge activities.12 Further, the TA \nwill encourage efforts at twinning or other collaborative arrangements between interested DMCs \nand countries within the region recognized to have procurement systems more closely aligned \nwith internationally accepted practices such as Hong Kong, China; the Republic of Korea; and \nSingapore.13\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,300,000 equivalent (Appendix 2). The TA \nwill be jointly financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013\nother sources) for $800,000 and by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty  Reduction  Fund  for  $500,000.14  All  disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.15  \n  \n                                                 \n12 These include, for instance, initiatives such as the Central Asia Regional Public Procurement Forum and similar \nactivities sponsored by regional organizations such as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, etc. The sponsored \nmeetings, conferences and/or workshops may be virtual or face-to-face, depending on TA funding constraints and \nother considerations. This output also covers TA assistance to support participation of procurement officials at \nrelevant development partner/CSO/other workshops, conferences, and meetings such as, e.g., the Netherlands-\nsponsored annual International Public Procurement Conferences, in addition to provision of resources for ADB-\nsponsored procurement-related events organization, management, and administration. \n13 For example, several organizations in Singapore are interested in providing advisory services and training to \nparticular DMCs provided Singapore\u2019s resources are utilized. These include Singapore\u2019s Civil Service College and \norganizations such as International Enterprise Singapore (promoting Singapore\u2019s private sector outreach), IDA \n(promoting use of Singapore\u2019s G-BIZ or e-procurement platform) and Singapore Cooperation Enterprise (promoting \nThues ev oief wSsin egaxpporeres speudbl ihc earnedin p arivreat eth soesceto or fe txhpee rctiosen)s. uTlthaenste a onrgda dnoiz antoiotn nse ecxepsressasreildy  irnetperreesste inn te txhpolosrein og fp AoDssBib\u2019sle  \nmceomllabbeorrsa, tiBveo aarrdra ongf eDmireencttso wrsit,h M AaDnBa gduerminegn TtA, o imr sptleamff,e anntadti omn.a y be preliminary in nature.  \n14 The latter fund is administered by ADB.

Manila. \n ", "6 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  administered  and \nimplemented by ADB COSO. The setting up of informal working groups (comprising DMC and \nCSO/NGO and private sector members) in each of ADB\u2019s five subregions16 will be encouraged \nto promote subregional dialogue and collaboration within the scope of TA activities. Three or \nfour individual national consultants will be recruited under the TA on an intermittent basis (i) to \nassist in design and development of the dynamic website, to manage website content and \nprepare  and  circulate  the  e-newsletter  (under  output  2);  (ii)  to  monitor  implementation  of \napproved PPF project proposals and to prepare related progress reports (under output I); and \n(iii) to coordinate and administer TA activities, organize conferences, workshops, and meetings \n(under output 3) and related activities. The estimated international and national consultant \ninputs are 20 and 185 person months, respectively. The outline terms of reference are in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  To assist in the preparation, evaluation, and implementation of PPF project proposals \n(under output 1) and for development of thematic position papers, analytical and country case \nstudies, and similar types of research in areas of importance to participant DMCs (under output \n2), the TA will require individual international and national consultants on a short-term as-\nneeded  basis  with  skills  and  expertise  in  public  procurement  reform,  management,  and \nimplementation, as well as in specific subject areas such as electronic procurement and public\u2013\nprivate  partnership  procurement.  The  terms  of  reference  for  such  short-term  individual \nconsultants will be developed as and when specific TA thematic and analytical research and \nadvisory assignments are identified. 17  \n \n22.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  January  2010  to  June  2013.  After  a  start-up \nconsultation meeting to develop a formal TA action plan to be held after TA approval, the first \nregional conference is planned for the first half of 2011 and the second regional conference will \nbe scheduled by early 2013. Periodic online surveys will be conducted to gather feedback on \nthe TA activities and monitor progress and outcomes. TA activities will be coordinated with \ndevelopment  partners  and  others,  providing  procurement  reform  and  capacity  related \nassistance to ensure effective alignment and complementary approaches.  \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 \non a grant basis for the Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.  \n \n                                                 \n16These five subregions are Central and West Asia, South Asia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific. The exact \ncomposition of each subregional working group and the actual subregional divisions will be decided by the relevant \nDMC participants themselves. No activities will be financed under the TA in the territory of a DMC unless such \nDMC has indicated that it has no objection to such proposed intervention. \n17 Depending on the subject matter and quantum of PPF project proposals, it may be appropriate during TA \nimplementation to recruit some or all such short-term consultants under indefinite delivery contracts to reduce costs \nand expedite implementation. \n ", "Appendix 1          7                          \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources/   \n    Reporting  Assumptions/ \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact       \nSignificant number of  Some 20% of ADB DMCs will improve  OECD-DAC  Baseline indicator \nparticipating ADB DMCs  procurement systems by a minimum of  baseline indicator  assessments will \nwill have undertaken  one point on the four-point OECD-DAC  assessments or  be conducted and \ninitiatives to align their  scale by 2014 (i.e., from A to B, or B to C,  assessments  validated in a \npublic procurement  etc.)  conducted using  sufficient number of \nsystems with  other tools  countries \ninternational good  agreed       \npractice   \n \nOutcome       \nPlatform to strengthen  An established and effective network of  Participant DMC  Participation and \nregional (and  procurement policy officials from a minimum  reports  political \nsubregional) exchange  of 20 ADB DMCs     commitment by \nof information and      DMCs \npartnership among  Minimum of 100 users from at least  ADB OIST report   \nCapacity and \npublic procurement  20 countries  registered to the website     \nmotivation of DMC \nofficials is operational    PPF reports \nofficials involved \n     \n \nCoordination  and \ncollaboration of \nother stakeholders \nand development \npartners  \n \nOutputs        \n1.
