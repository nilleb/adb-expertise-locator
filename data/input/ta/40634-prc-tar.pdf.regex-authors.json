INTRODUCTION \n   \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) assistance to prepare the proposed Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion  Environmental  Improvement  Project  (Phase  II).  The  concept  paper  for  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) was approved on 2 May 2007. A fact-finding mission \nvisited the PRC from 19 to 28 May and reached an agreement with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1 \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The PRC energy supply is heavily dependent on coal, which makes up 69% of the \nprimary  energy  supply.  The  heavy  dependence  on  coal  has  resulted  in  substantial \nenvironmental damage caused by emissions such as sulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxides (NO ), \n2 x\ntotal suspended particulates (TSP), and other harmful emissions. SO  and NO  are the main \n2 x\nprecursor gases that cause acid rain, one of the largest environmental problems in the PRC, \nTSP causes serious public health impacts. CO , which is a major emission from coal burning, is \n2\na major cause of global warming. Air pollution alone is estimated to result in an annual loss of \n1.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) for the PRC economy. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion (IMAR) is heavily dependent on coal use with coal supplying 92% of the primary energy \nsupply and 95% of energy for heating purposes (2006). In 2005, IMAR discharged 1.46 million \ntons of SO , representing 5.7% of the national emission, although the IMAR population is only \n2\n1.8% of the national total. Coal burning by households contributes an estimated 6% of IMAR \nannual SO  emissions. Reliance on coal has a high environmental cost for urban areas in IMAR \n2\nwith only 6 of its 20 cities reaching class II air quality standards (2006) and large areas being \nimpacted by acid rain. \n \n3.  Demand for district heating is growing rapidly in the PRC through increased incomes \nand privatization of residential housing. Low rise residential buildings that are expensive to \nsupply with district heating are rapidly being replaced with high rise residential buildings more \nsuitable for district heating. Urbanization and increased demand for district heating is also \nincreasing  in  IMAR  due  to  Government  relocation  policies  for  animal  herders  to  reduce \nenvironmental pressure on fragile pasture lands. IMAR has a total population of 23.86 million; \nthe urban population increased from 42.2% in 2000 to 47.2% in 2005. As a consequence, the \ndistrict heating area is expanding rapidly, increasing by 19% between 2003 and 2004 and a \nfurther 23% between 2004 and 2005. A large proportion of the existing heating systems are \nsmall capacity, highly polluting, inefficient, neighborhood coal-fired boilers, and an aging pipe \nnetwork with high distribution losses. In many urban areas the district heating systems were \ninstalled in the 1970s and have exceeded their design lives, resulting in high distribution losses \nand unreliable services. Additionally, due to relatively poor economic conditions, remote areas \nhave inadequate heating supply; this has a proportionally high impact on the poor.  \n \n4.  The  low  efficiency  of  the  existing  IMAR  heating  systems,  both  in  generation  and \ndistribution, leads directly to environmental impacts from emissions because of increased coal \nconsumption.  The  PRC  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  improving  the  energy \nefficiency of the economy. The PRC 11th Five-Year Plan mandates a 20% reduction in energy \nintensity by 2010. During 2006, energy intensity of the PRC economy reduced by 1.23%, which \nincreased the improvement required in the remaining 4 years. The IMAR target is to improve \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 3 May 2007.  \n ", "2   \nenergy intensity by 25% by 2010. This will be a major challenge considering IMAR uses 2.48 \ntons of standard coal equivalent per CNY10,000 of GDP, as opposed to the national average of \n1.22 (2005). Large energy efficiency gains are available from the district heating subsector \nthrough system replacement and upgrading of the heat production and distribution systems. For \nexample, small heating boilers typically have efficiencies of about 40%, while new larger boilers \nhave efficiencies exceeding 80%. Additional opportunities for improving energy efficiency and \nreducing  environmental  impact  in  district  heating  include  (i)  utilizing  alternative  renewable \nenergy  sources,  such  as  geothermal  energy;  and  (ii)  capturing  waste  heat  from  existing \nindustrial processes.   \n \n5.  Provision of reliable, affordable household heating is a basic necessity in IMAR due to \nsevere winter conditions, when temperatures can fall to as low as minus 40o Celsius, and the \nheating season can extend for 7 months. Environmental impacts from the current heating \nmethods have a disproportionately high impact on the poor. Inadequate coverage of district \nheating to low income urban areas results in use of indoor coal burning for heating purposes, \nwhich is a major cause of respiratory disease. Urban pollution from small local boilers also \nreduces outdoor air quality and has a significant cumulative negative impact on public health. \nIMAR has 31 national poverty counties and 29 provincial poverty counties with 697,000 people \nliving below the poverty line (2005). The cost of heating for the poor is relatively high. For \nexample, a typical family living at the poverty line in a remote area of IMAR could expect to pay \naround 20%\u201330% of annual income on heating bills. The Mongol population, at 4.1 million, \naccounts for 17.6% of the total IMAR population (2005); this percentage is higher in the remote \nand poorer areas. The initial poverty and social analysis is presented in Appendix 2.  \n \n6.  Local government financial resources and central Government support are inadequate to \nmeet the large investment requirements in the IMAR heating subsector. In particular, the more \nremote municipalities and counties lack financial resources to replace and expand existing \nheating systems. Private sector involvement has been relatively slow, due to (i) reluctance to \nprivatize the delivery of an essential public service; (ii) relatively low financial return, (iii) small \nsize of operations in smaller urban areas; and (iv) reluctance of local financial institutions to \nprovide financing, particularly in smaller more remote urban areas. A range of barriers need to \nbe analyzed and addressed to encourage private sector participation in district heating. The TA \nwill continue ADB policy dialogue on district heating reform to develop the enabling environment.  \n \n7.  The Government is working to address the impact of environmental issues and low \nenergy efficiency of the economy. The proposed project supports the following 11th Five-Year \nPlan targets: (i) decrease SO  emissions by 10% by reducing coal consumption; (ii) improve \n2\nenergy efficiency by 20% per unit GDP by replacing obsolete and inefficient boilers, improve \nefficiency of district heating distribution networks, recover industrial waste heat, and utilize \nrenewable energy; and (iii) optimize development of renewable energy resources. The TA will \nalso (i) provide policy advice to several levels of government on improving the efficiency of \npublic utility services, (ii) strengthen the institutional capacity of the executing and implementing \nagencies, and (iii) help improve corporate governance and financial management of local heat \nsuppliers.  \n \n8.  The proposed project is consistent with (i) the strategic priority of ADB\u2019s Medium-Term \nStrategy  II,  2006\u20132008  of  managing  the  environment,2 and  (ii)  the  strategic  development \nobjective of the PRC country strategy and program to improve the environment.3 The proposed \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nproject will build on continuing engagement in the heating subsector, including a number of \nrecent advisory TA projects.4 In December 2006, ADB approved a project5 (2006 project) that \ntargets district heating and gas distribution in Bayannur, Erdos and Wuhai districts of IMAR. The \nproposed project will assist the government of the IMAR (GIMAR) in extending improved and \ndiversified district heating and gas supply to other urban areas, including more remote and \npoorer municipalities and counties. The proposed project will incorporate recommendations and \nlessons from the previous advisory TAs and the 2006 project.    \n \n9.  Previous ADB projects targeting environment improvements in the energy sector provide \nmany lessons. In some projects, initial heating demand forecasts were inaccurate; this led to \nsubsequent canceling of heating subprojects. In some industrial projects, technologies could not \nbe properly transferred due to technical incompatibilities with PRC industrial conditions. The \nproposed project will address these issues by (i) undertaking a detailed demand analysis for all \nsubprojects, and (ii) ensuring that all central heating systems are based on demonstrated \ntechnology currently being operated in the PRC. Risks will be carefully assessed during project \npreparation by incorporating lessons identified from earlier projects for design, preparation, risk \nassessment, and implementation.  \n \n10.  During preparation of the 2006 project, some processing delays were experienced due \nto the poor quality of the prefeasibility studies. Several separate design institutes were engaged \nto prepare different subprojects, which made ensuring consistent quality difficult. Further, some \nimplementing agencies had relatively low project development capacity. This project preparatory \nTA will address these issues by (i) screening design institutes that will prepare the feasibility \nstudies, thereby reducing the number of design institutes and improving quality; (ii) conducting \ntraining sessions for implementing agencies on ADB procedures and anticipated schedules; and \n(iii) helping the design institutes with reviews from an early stage. GIMAR is the executing \nagency for the project preparatory TA, as it is for the 2006 project, and the majority of staff at \nthe Project Management Office will be retained for TA implementation. This should ensure \nconsistency and improve processing efficiency.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved environment of 13 IMAR urban areas through \nincreased efficiency of the district heating and gas distribution systems. The outcome of the TA \nwill be an agreement between the central Government and ADB on project design, feasibility \nstudy, and implementation arrangements for an ensuing project.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will (i) assess IMAR\u2019s district heating subsector; (ii) carry out a demand forecast, \nincluding  least-cost  system  planning;  (iii)  evaluate  the  technical  feasibility  and  engineering \n                                                 \n4\n (i) ADB. 2004.

The major assumptions in the proposed project design include (i) the Government and \nADB will sign the loan agreement, (ii) stakeholders effectively engage in the proposed project, \n(iii) the Government establishes effective ownership over the proposed project, and (iv) the \nimplementing agencies allows full access to relevant documentation. Efforts will be made to \nengage stakeholders at an early stage to ensure support. Careful consultant selection and \nongoing supervision will ensure that quality consultants are selected and reports are delivered \naccording to schedule. Risks include that the schedule may be impacted by delay in consultant \nrecruitment  or  an  early  winter.  Early  consultant  recruitment  will  ensure  that  field  work  is \ncompleted prior to the 2006\u20132007 winter season.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $800,000 on a grant \nbasis from ADB's TA funding program, and GIMAR will finance $200,000. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are given in Appendix 3. The Government has been informed that \nprovision of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The TA will be carried out by a consulting firm with experience in district heating supply, \ninstitutional reform, economic analysis, financial analysis, environmental assessment, and social \nimpact analysis. The six international consultants (combined 15 person-months) will include (i) \ndistrict heating specialist, (ii) private sector development specialist, (iii) economist, (iv) financial \nand  institutional  analyst,  (v)  geothermal  specialist,  and  (vi)  environment  specialist.  The  13 \nnational consultants (combined 46 person-months) will include (i) district heating specialist, (ii) \nprivate sector development specialists, (iii) economist, (iv) financial and institutional analysts, (v) \ngeothermal  specialist,  (vi)  natural  gas  distribution  specialist,  (vii)  social  and  resettlement \nspecialists, (viii) environment specialist, and (ix) project monitoring specialist. The consultants \nwill submit the following reports: (i) inception report in week 10, (ii) draft final report in week 18, \nand (iii) final report in week 28. Tripartite meetings will be held after the consultants submit the \ninception, draft final, and final reports. International and national consultants will be selected and \nengaged in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The services of consultants will be provided through a consulting firm \nselected after the submission of simplified technical proposals and the use of quality and cost-\nbased  selection  methods  (technical  proposals  80%,  financial  proposals  20%).  The  TA  is \nexpected to commence in October 2007 and be completed by April 2008. The outline terms of \nreference are presented in Appendix 4.  \n \n16.  GIMAR will assign the project management office of the 2006 project the responsibility to \ncoordinate TA implementation, and will provide suitable increases in resource allocation. Where \n ", "  5\npossible, the existing facilities and staff of the existing Project Management Office will be utilized. \nGIMAR has agreed to provide interpreters, local transportation, and office space in Hohhot \nequipped with suitable facilities. Some of the office equipment will be financed under the TA and \nbe  procured  by  the  international  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB  Guidelines  for \nProcurement (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be turned over to the \nGIMAR upon completion of the TA. Workshops and seminars will be undertaken to improve \ncapacity of project stakeholders, including implementing agencies, and assist in coordinating the \nTA.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  Preparing  the  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region Environment  Improvement Project (Phase II), and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets/Indicators  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Sources/Reporti and Risks  \n  ng Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImprove the environment in 13  Improved energy efficiency of  Project  \u2022  The Government and \nurban areas of the Inner  heating systems per square meter   Management  Asian Development Bank \nMongolia Autonomous Region    Office monitoring  (ADB) sign the loan \n(IMAR) through increased  Reduced air emissions from district  reports  agreement \nefficiency of district heating and  heating systems in IMAR     \ngas distribution systems    Annual loan   \nClosure of defined number of small  review report   \nheating boilers (target to be   \nquantified during the project   \npreparatory technical assistance \n[TA]) \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nProposed project design,  Memorandum of understanding of  \u2022  Consultants\u2019  \u2022  Stakeholders effectively \nfeasibility study, and  the final tripartite meeting signed by  final report  engage in project \nimplementation arrangements  the Government and ADB during  \u2022  Memorandum  \u2022  Government establishes \nagreed upon by the Government  the tripartite review mission  of  effective ownership over \nand ADB    understanding  project   \n\u2022  Back-to-office    \nreport of \ntripartite \nreview \nmission \nOutputs      Assumption \n       \n1.
