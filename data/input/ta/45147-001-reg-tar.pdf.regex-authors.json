INTRODUCTION \n1.  Information and communication technology (ICT) has had an enormous impact on the \nway governments carry out their functions. The use of appropriate ICT tools and applications \nhas enabled governments to provide more efficient services to improve their communication and \ntransform their relationship with citizens, businesses, and other public sector institutions. ICT \nhas also been increasingly used as a tool to reduce corruption. However, the weak organization \ncapacity of government agencies in developing member countries (DMCs), in terms of ICT \nadoption and project implementation, is identified as a major reason for failure to reap the \npotential benefits of e-government projects. To address this constraint, in 2009 ADB approved \nregional capacity development technical assistance (TA),1 which developed an e-government \ncapability maturity model (CMM)\u2014a tool for assessing the maturity of an organization based on \na set of criteria vis-\u00e0-vis the requirements of a given e-government project. The model was \napplied  to  three  pilot  ICT  agencies  in  Mongolia,  the  Philippines,  and  Viet  Nam.  The  pilot \ncountries noted that the TA raised awareness of the importance of e-government capacity \ndevelopment across various levels of government.  \n \n2.  The  current  TA  will  support  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  public  sector  e-\ngovernment projects in selected DMCs. It will focus on specific projects that are at the design or \nimplementation  stage,  and  will  develop  e-government  toolkits  specific  to  the  use  of  a  tax \nadministration management information system (TAMIS) and a social security administration \ninformation  system  (SSAIS).  The  TA  will  benefit  other  DMCs  through  various  knowledge \nproducts that will be developed. Fact-finding missions were carried out for Tajikistan (22\u201323 \nSeptember 2011), Viet Nam (28\u201329 September 2011), and Sri Lanka (13\u201314 October 2011) to \ndiscuss and agree on the impact, outcomes, outputs, and implementation arrangements of the \nTA. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  During the final workshop of the 2009 regional TA, participating countries expressed \nsome concern that the e-governance initiative could not be sustained without external support \nand that further assistance was needed to customize the e-government CMM to their specific \ncountry situation. Further, the CMM tool would be more relevant if it were fine-tuned to specific \ne-government applications or a DMC\u2019s specific project needs. Most DMCs, with still very limited \ncapacity, resources, and hands-on experience in adopting such a tool, would find this next step \nextremely difficult without continued guidance and support.  \n \n4.  To address these challenges, the current TA is to help sustain the momentum gained \nfrom  the  initial  e-governance  capacity  development  project  and,  more  importantly,  to \ncomplement ongoing ICT-supported public sector operations. The ADB regional departments \nconcerned were asked to identify potential e-government projects to be supported in selected \nDMCs  where ADB assistance can be relevant and useful in ongoing public sector reform \nprograms, especially in areas where ADB has already provided or currently provides support. \nPriority  e-government  applications  and  participating  DMCs  were  identified  through  a \n                                                \n1   ADB.  2009.  Technical  Assistance  on  Improving  Public  Services  Through  Information  and  Communication \nTechnology. Manila. (REG 7351) aimed to enhance the organizational capacity of governments of three countries \n(Mongolia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam) to formulate, direct, and implement e-government projects in the sectors \nof agriculture, education, health, and public administration. The TA included (i) developing an e-government CMM \nand ICT project guidebook, (ii) providing associated training and introducing available capacity development \nprograms, and (iii) supporting strategies for development, as appropriate. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 3 November 2011. \n ", "2           \nbrainstorming seminar under the Governance and Public Management Community of Practice \nand fact-finding missions during TA preparation. \n \n5.   Of  the  three  countries,  Sri  Lanka  and  Tajikistan  need  assistance  for  TAMIS;  and \nTajikistan and Viet Nam need assistance for SSAIS. \n \n6.  Specific e-government domain areas, and their concomitant challenges, in the proposed \nfocus countries\u2014Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam\u2014include the following: \n \n(i)       In Sri Lanka, the ADB-financed Fiscal Management Reform Project (FMRP) was \nimplemented in 2005\u20132008. It supported the government in strengthening its \npublic finance by improving the public resource management system, promoting \nfiscal discipline, and supporting fiscal decentralization. In particular, it sought to \ncreate  an  enabling  environment  to  foster  mobilization  of  tax  revenues  and \nimprove  effectiveness  of  public  expenditures.  Designed  to  take  a  phased \napproach, the FMRP (now phase 2) will focus on implementation through setting \nup a tax and treasury management information system. In an effort to support the \nFMRP  (phase  2),  ADB  approved  a  loan  to  finance  the  Fiscal  Management \nEfficiency  Project  (FMEP)  to  develop  a  revenue  administration  management \ninformation  system.3   In  consultation  with  the  Public  Management,  Financial \nSector, and Trade Division of ADB South Asia Department, the TA will support \nFMEP through e-government capacity development. The Ministry of Finance and \nPlanning expressed strong interest in receiving technical support for the FMEP, \nsuggesting that the TA focus on training government officials for more advanced \ntax and fiscal administration.  \n(ii)       For Tajikistan, ADB approved a $45 million grant in March 2011 to strengthen the \ncountry\u2019s social protection programs and tax management reforms. 4 The Ministry \nof Labor and Social Protection will be provided with support to carry out a pilot \nprogram for non-cash-based pension payments using plastic cards and another \npilot program for consolidation of a multiple benefits system. Also, assistance will \nbe provided to the State Tax Committee to support the introduction of electronic \nfiling  of  tax  returns  by  large  taxpayers  and  other  measures  to  improve \ntransparency and tax collection. The Public Management, Financial Sector, and \nTrade Division of ADB Central and West Asia Department requested TA support \nfor  the  e-government  components  of  the  grant  program.  The  State  Tax \nCommittee and Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, the government agencies \nresponsible  for  tax  management  reform  and  the  social  protection  program \nrespectively, expressed strong interest in receiving technical support for their e-\ngovernment projects.  \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Technical \nAssistance Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Fiscal Management Efficiency Project ). \nManila. The $50 million loan was approved on 15 April 2010. Currently, the project is in the bidding process to \nprocure a main contractor for the revenue administration management information system. \n4  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the \nRepublic of Tajikistan for the Strengthening Public Resource Management Program. Manila.  The $45 million grant \nwas approved on 12 Apr 2011. The program aims to strengthen public resource management in Tajikistan through \nimproved tax policy and administration, more effective and efficient social safety net programs, and improved \npublic financial management. \n ", "  3 \n(iii)       In  Viet  Nam,  the  government  committed  to  developing  a  modern,  fair,  and \ntransparent  social  security  system  through  the  recent  social  security \nadministration reform proposal of Viet Nam Social Security (VSS). The proposal \nis intended to strengthen the operating efficiency and capacity of VSS, with a \nfocus on improved business processes and information management, enhanced \nservice  to  clients,  better  transparency,  and  strengthened  management  of \nreserves. VSS emphasizes the importance of ICT in reforming social security \nadministration but also expresses concern about the agency\u2019s lack of institutional \ncapacity to implement a complex e-government project such as the SSAIS. It has \nasked for ADB support to develop e-governance capacity and help the agency \ndevelop the SSAIS as part of its Social Security Administration Modernization \nProgram. \n7.  Results of the fact-finding missions confirm the urgent need to enhance e-government \ncapacity to implement e-governance projects. The TA will develop e-government toolkits for the \nTAMIS and SSAIS and adapt them for participating countries to enhance their capacity for  \ne-government projects through e-government capacity development programs. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be improved government work productivity and better public \nservices  using  e-government  applications.  The  outcome  will  be  successful  e-government \nprojects and strengthened e-governance capacity of government agencies concerned in the \nparticipating DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will maximize current knowledge and experiences through collaboration with \nnotable  development  agencies  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  such  as  the  National  Information \nSociety Agency,5 the National IT Industry Promotion Agency,6 and the Korea Development \nInstitute.7 Given the complex nature of e-government projects\u2014both ICT and public sector \nreform  need  to  be  considered  together\u2014learning  from  countries  with  actual  experience  in \nsuccessfully  applying  ICT  to  various  public  sector  reform  initiatives  will  be  important.  The \nRepublic of Korea is widely recognized as a rich learning source of best practices in public \nsector reforms and e-government. Moreover, this collaboration is in line with the Republic of \nKorea\u2013ADB  Knowledge  Partnership  agreement,  signed  in  May  2011,  to  open  up  new \nopportunities  for  maximizing  knowledge  sharing  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The  TA  will  also \ncollaborate  with  the  United  Nations  Asian  and  Pacific Training  Centre for  Information  and \n                                                \n5  The National Information Society Agency has been managing the information technology learning program, \ndesigned to promote international cooperation to build human capacity among developing countries, with financial \nsupport from the Ministry of Public Administration and Security.  \n6  The mission of the National IT Industry Promotion Agency, a government agency under the Ministry of Knowledge \nEconomy, is to promote the national ICT industry. As part of economic cooperation and knowledge partnerships \nwith developing countries, it has provided TA to various e-government projects in developing countries. \n7  The Korea Development Institute, an autonomous policy-oriented research organization under the Ministry of \nStrategy and Finance, is an economic think tank. In an effort to share the country\u2019s economic development \nexperiences, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance launched the Knowledge Sharing Program in 2004, with the \nKorea Development Institute implementing the program. \n ", "4           \nCommunication Technology for Development (UN-APCICT)8 for the dissemination of knowledge \ngained from the project to other developing countries outside of the focus countries. \n \n10.  The TA will have four major outputs: (i) development of e-government toolkits on the \nTAMIS; (ii) development of e-government toolkits on the SSAIS; (iii) capacity development for \nthe TAMIS  and  SSAIS for the focus countries (Sri  Lanka, Tajikistan,  and  Viet  Nam);  and  \n(iv) knowledge dissemination and awareness-raising about the e-governance initiative. \n \n(i)       Outputs 1 and 2. The e-government toolkits on the TAMIS and SSAIS will be \ndeveloped for the priority areas selected from the e-government CMM ranging \nfrom  e-government  strategy,  business  process,  organizational  capacity,  and \ngovernance of information technology. The e-government toolkits will be tailored \nto  specific  situations  and  requirements  from  each  participating  country.  In \naddition, e-government toolkits will be made available online through the UN-\nAPCICT website. \n(ii)       Output  3.  In  the  course  of  implementing  components  1  and  2,  specific  e-\ngovernment capacity development programs focusing on the TAMIS and SSAIS \nwill be developed and adapted for the government agencies concerned. These \nwill include the development of knowledge products customized for Sri Lanka, \nTajikistan, and Viet Nam; and in-country training and consultations to assist the \ngovernments  in  formulating,  directing,  and/or  implementing  the  TAMIS  and \nSSAIS projects.  \n(iii)       Output 4. The TA will have a regional conference to disseminate knowledge \nproducts  such  as  e-government  toolkits  and  to  share  e-government  project \nexperiences  for  the  benefit  of  participating  countries  as  well  as  other \nnonparticipating DMCs.  \n \n11.  A number of risks and assumptions are associated with the TA outputs and outcome.  \nFor the outcome, strong ownership by the participating governments in the form of continuous \nsupport for the e-governance capacity development initiative beyond the TA is assumed. Risks \nare associated with the lack of country resources and weak commitment from the governments \nto implement the interventions necessary for the e-government capacity development initiatives. \nThese risks will be mitigated through close collaboration with ADB regional departments and \nresident missions concerned to strengthen the link between the e-government initiatives and \nrelated public sector reform programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The Government of the Republic of Korea and UN-APCICT will make in-\nkind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n                                                \n8  UN-APCICT is a regional institute of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific \n(UNESCAP), mandated to build human and institutional capacity for ICT among UNESCAP member countries.  \n ", "  5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA  and  be  responsible  for  the  overall \nmanagement and monitoring of activities. The implementing agencies for the respective country \ncomponents will be the Ministry of Finance and Planning in Sri Lanka, the State Tax Committee \nand the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection in Tajikistan, and VSS in Viet Nam. ADB will \nclosely collaborate with the government agencies of the Republic of Korea and will make a \nformal  agreement  for  their  in-kind  contributions,  if  necessary.  The  TA  will  work  in  close \ncoordination with ADB\u2019s regional departments and resident missions. \n \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  January  2012  to  June  2013.  It  will  require  two \ninternational consultants, one each to work on the TAMIS and SSAIS for the duration of the TA \n(6  person-months  each,  on  an  intermittent  basis).  The  international  consultants  will  be \nresponsible for (i) overall project management in each domain area; (ii) the assessment of  \ne-government  capacity  of  the  government  agencies  concerned;  (iii)  the  development  of  \ne-government toolkits for a specific application; (iv) the refinement of the e-government CMM \nand ICT guidebook, as necessary; (v) conduct of in-country training; and (vi) the development of \nknowledge products for the regional conference. Three national consultants will be contracted to \nliaise and facilitate communication between the respective government and ADB\u2019s project team, \nand to provide research support (4 person-months each). An experienced national research \nconsultant will assist in developing the e-government toolkits and monitoring project progress \n(12 person-months, on an intermittent basis). All consultants will be recruited on an individual \nbasis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). All disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of \nreference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Confirmation  of  the  no-objection  of  DMC \ngovernments will be obtained before commencing or financing activities in the participating \nDMCs. \n \n15.  The TA will be monitored through regular progress reports, consensus-building activities \nwith  workshops,  and  an  informal  survey  to  gain  comments  and  suggestions  from  key \nstakeholders.  The  TA  will  include  an  inception  workshop  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  or  the \nPhilippines 1 month after consultants are mobilized. A series of country workshops and a \nregional workshop may also be held in collaboration with the Government of the Republic of \nKorea and UN-APCICT. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Supporting \nPublic Management through e-Government Capacity Development, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6    Ap pendix 1     \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved  Reduced transaction time and  Official reports published  Government officials in \ngovernment work  citizen satisfaction for the  or announcements made  participating DMCs are strongly \nproductivity and  public services through the  by government agencies  committed to applying the \nbetter public  TAMIS and SSAIS in  in participating DMCs  knowledge required through \nservices using   government agencies in    training \ne-government  participating DMCs     \napplications  concerned     \n   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened   Measured e-governance  Official reports published  The implementing agencies \ne-governance  capacity through   or announcements made  exhibit strong ownership of the TA \ncapacity  e-government CMM and  by government agencies   \nappreciation of government  in participating DMCs  Relevant stakeholders provide \nagencies concerned in    continuous support for  \nparticipating DMCs     e-governance capacity \n  development initiatives \n \nRisks \nGeneral e-government absorptive \ncapacity and specialized \ngovernment technical capacity is \nlacking \n \nNational ownership of and \ncommitment to the e-governance \ninitiative is lacking \n \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.
