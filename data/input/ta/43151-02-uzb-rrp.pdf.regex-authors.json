I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans;  and  (ii)  proposed  administration  of  a  loan  extended  by  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency (JICA), all to the Republic of Uzbekistan (Uzbekistan) for the Talimarjan \nPower Project. A design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  Uzbekistan's economy grew at an annual average rate of 7% during 2004\u20132006 and 9% \nin 2007\u20132008. Despite the global financial and economic crisis, growth prospects for 2010 and \nbeyond are expected to be within a range of 8%\u20139%. The country has taken a gradual rather \nthan rapid shock approach to reform, and the response to the crisis was swift, balanced, and \nsuccessful.  \n \n3.  Uzbekistan has the most industrialized and energy intensive economy in Central Asia. \nFor each dollar of gross domestic product, Uzbekistan uses 60% more energy than Azerbaijan \nand Kazakhstan, and four times more than the world average;1 this stems from (i) aging and \ndilapidated energy infrastructure, (ii) a low technological base, (iii) lack of investment, and (iv) \ninefficiency.  \n \n4.  Energy efficiency is now a top strategic priority for Uzbekistan, as well as for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),2 and represents the best means (in terms of reducing cost and \ncarbon intensity) to achieve energy security. It reduces the currently high levels of energy \nintensity, and increases energy productivity. The social and economic benefits are also high. \nConsumers spend less, power generation and dispatch costs fall and the financial return to the \nutilities  increase.  Increased  revenues  underpin  more  investment,  better  maintenance,  and \nimproved service quality. \n \n5.  The government has in place policy and legal frameworks to reduce energy intensity \nlevels  and  cut  losses,  and  has  plans  for  significant  clean  technology  investments  and \ninstitutional reforms. In the short to medium term (2009\u20132014), power generation capacity will \nneed to increase considerably to match electricity demand growth of 3.1%\u20135.4% a year. The \nconstruction  of  new  and  more  efficient  combined  cycle  gas  turbine  (CCGT)  plants  fit  the \nstrategy. Other actions include expanding renewable energy, energy efficiency programs, the \nreplacement or rehabilitation of old and obsolete thermal power plants, and energy trade. \n \n6.  Investment in CCGT technology leads to high energy savings and environmental benefits. \nIt is the cleanest fossil fuel-based method of power generation available, and CCGT power plants \nburning natural gas produce significantly less carbon emissions than do coal- and oil-fired thermal \npower plants. \n \n7.  Uzbekistan is rich in hydrocarbon resources.3 Another strategic priority is the processing \n(or value-added production) of these resources for both domestic and foreign markets. This \nstrategy requires substantial investment and investors, with transactions most likely structured \naround a range of public and private initiatives, several of which are under consideration. \n                                                 \n1  International Energy Agency. 2009. World Energy Outlook. Paris. \n2  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n3  Uzbekistan is estimated to have 1.8 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves, 590 million barrels of \nproven oil reserves, and 3 billion tons of recoverable coal reserves. \n ", "2     \n8.  Increased energy production in Uzbekistan directly benefits several countries in the \nregion. Afghanistan already gets most of its electricity from Uzbekistan. Other beneficiaries are \nTajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic, both of which are rich in hydro resources but prone to winter \nshortages. The Uzbek power transmission system also facilitates transfer of power supplies \nbetween these two countries and Turkmenistan. Uzbekistan is a natural gas exporter, including \nto the People's Republic of China. In the medium term, Uzbekistan will also pursue power \nexports to new energy-deficit markets such as Pakistan.  \n \n9.  Uzbekistan is an active participant in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nProgram  (CAREC),  which  includes  Afghanistan,  Azerbaijan,  People's  Republic  of  China, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan. In 2008, the CAREC countries agreed \non a long-term strategy for developing the region's energy sector, which focuses on energy \nsecurity and trade.4 In October 2009, the countries agreed on a framework action plan to \nexpand the regional power network as a means to increase trade in power.5 ADB and other \nmultilateral institutions participating in CAREC are cofinancing studies, capacity development, \nand  investments.  It  was  under  this  framework  that  Uzbekistan  started  exporting  power  to \nAfghanistan (up to 150 megawatts [MW]) in early 2009; these exports will soon rise to 300 MW.  \n \n10.  Power  generation. In 2008, Uzbekistan generated 50,254 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of \nelectric power, imported 925 GWh from its neighbors, and exported about 630 GWh. The total \ninstalled capacity for power generation is 12,400 MW, but less than 10,000 MW are available. \nThermal power plants (TPPs) represent 86% and hydropower plants 14% of the capacity. \nNatural  gas  is  used  for  94%  of  thermal  power  generation.  All  TPPs  run  on  steam  cycle \ntechnology with an efficiency rate of 31%, compared to 57% under advanced CCGT technology. \nTotal losses (net generation output less invoiced energy) are 20% of generated energy. The \nheavy  reliance  on  and  inefficient  use  of  fossil  fuels  in  power  generation  creates  negative \nenvironmental impacts, while CCGT power plants reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \n11.  Most assets are 40\u201350 years old, and require replacement and/or rehabilitation. Since \n1991, only two power generation capacity expansion projects have been completed. By 2015, \nthe government wants to replace 570 MW of inefficient (25% efficiency), outdated generation \ncapacity and install three CCGT power plants totaling 1,600 MW. Construction of two such \nprojects in Tashkent and Navoi began in 2009. The third project is the one proposed here. \n \n12.  Power transmission. The transmission system consists of 1,850 kilometers (km) of 500 \nkilovolt (kV) lines, 6,200 km of 220 kV lines, and 15,300 km of 110 kV lines. The high voltage \nsystem is connected to Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. It also has \na 220 kV connection with Afghanistan. The transmission system is ageing and needs upgrading. \nTransmission bottlenecks are becoming a serious obstacle to the delivery of power to domestic \nand regional customers.  \n \n13.  The southern region of Uzbekistan receives electricity from the northern region, where \n70% of power generation is located. However, over 90% of gas production is located in the \nsouth. This means gas is transported to the north for conversion to electricity, which is then sent \nback to customers in the south. In 2009, the electricity peak demand in the southern region \nsurpassed 2,000 MW, but the north\u2013south transmission capacity is limited to about 1,600 MW, \nresulting in shortages during peak hours. This energy flow problem is compounded by growing \nindustrialization in the south. The CCGT power plants to be constructed in Talimarjan and Navoi \n                                                 \n4  CAREC Seventh Ministerial Conference. 2008.

They will also free up transmission capacity to supply neighboring \ncountries. \n \n14.  The state joint stock company, Uzbekenergo, the sole power sector utility in the country, \nis a vertically integrated and publicly owned monopoly. It owns and operates 10 TPPs (including \nthree  cogeneration  plants),  and  28  hydropower  plants.  It  owns  and  operates  the  power \ntransmission network. It also distributes power to all categories of customers from its 14 regional \ndistribution  centers,  which  have  256  distribution  units.  A  restructuring  of  Uzbekenergo  is \nplanned. The key objective is to commercialize its utility operations and introduce competition in \nvarious business lines.  \n \n15.  To realize the power system modernization and rehabilitation program, Uzbekenergo will \ncontinue  to  seek  investment  from  international  lenders  and  the  private  sector.  To  secure \nfinance, it plans to (i) modernize its accounting system with a financial management information \nsystem, (ii) improve financial transparency in line with international auditing standards and \nreporting practices, and (iii) review the internal financial management structure by establishing \ninternal auditing.  \n \n16.  Uzbekenergo wants to transform its management and operations to become a model \npower utility company in the region. This requires new skills, new business practices, and new \ntechnology.  The  management  of  Uzbekenergo  is  committed  to  change.  Uzbekenergo  also \nneeds expert technical capacity to operate CCGTs. \n \nB.  Project Impact and Outcome \n17.  The project involves a new power plant to improve energy security and facilitate regional \nenergy trade. It also aims to increase energy efficiency and save energy through clean power \ngeneration.  Supporting  investments  will  increase  regional  connectivity,  and  improve  power \nsector performance and management, and customer service. \n \nC.  Outputs \n18.  Outputs are physical and nonphysical in nature. Power supply will be increased by 4,700 \nGWh per year, and power generation efficiency will increase from 31% to 50%. The power \nsystem will operate more reliably, and Uzbekenergo's corporate management and performance \nwill be improved.  \n \n1.  Physical \n19.  Two CCGT units (370\u2013450 MW each) will be constructed at the Talimarjan TPP. Each \nunit will include (i) a gas turbine with electrical generator; (ii) heat recovery steam generator \n(HRSG); (iii) steam turbine with electrical generator; (iv) deaerator unit; (v) steam condenser; \nand (vi) ancillary equipment including generator transformer, systems for control, electrical \nswitching,  oil,  water  and  gas  treatment,  cooling  water,  and  all  other  plant  auxiliaries. \nConstruction will be done by an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor. \nThe EPC contract scope covers detailed design, selection of equipment, installation, testing and \ncommissioning. The first unit will be commissioned in March 2014, and the second unit in \nDecember 2014. An implementation consultant will supervise the construction and report on \nprogress. \n \n ", "4     \n20.  A community service center will also be built for the power plant employees and their \nfamilies. Uzbekenergo will use this center for (i) vocational training for female family members; \n(ii) finance for microenterprises such as a laundry service, salon, bakery, cafe and a handicrafts \nworkshop; (iii) training on various social issues (such as hygiene, preventive medical, family \nplanning, and child rearing); (iv) cultural activities; and (v) sports and recreational activities. \n \n2.  Nonphysical \n21.  A  special  capacity  development  component  will  support  the  improvement  of \nUzbekenergo\u2019s  management,  financial,  and  operational  performance.  Key  areas  are:  (i) \ncorporate management, (ii) financial management systems and audit capabilities, (iii) operation \nand maintenance of CCGT power plants, and (iv) social and gender development aspects. The \nprogram will start with a comprehensive needs assessment. Experts will be engaged to help \nUzbekenergo  with  the  work.  The  necessary  equipment,  software,  training,  and  consulting \nservices will be financed under the project.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n22.

DUE DILIGENCE7 \nA.  Technical \n28.  Talimarjan TPP is located 500 km southwest of Tashkent in Kashkadarya province. The \n800 MW gas-fired steam-cycle unit (unit 1) was commissioned in 2004. The original design \nenvisaged four such units (total capacity of 3,200 MW), and the power plant infrastructure\u2014\nincluding power evacuation, gas supply, and cooling water systems, and a dedicated rail access \nfrom the main railroad network\u2014has been constructed for that capacity. Power is evacuated \nthrough the 220 kV network. The project's proposed power transmission facility will improve \nevacuation reliability by connecting the CCGT units to the 500 kV network. Natural gas is \nsupplied from the Shuritan gas field and processing facilities located about 30 km from the \nTalimarjan TPP. Supply comes through the main pipeline system through a dedicated gate \nstation (2 km from the plant). Gas reserves and supply capacity of 953 million cubic meters (m3) \nper year is assured for the life of the CCGT plant. Water is supplied from the Amu Darya River \nthrough the Karshi Main Canal (KMC), a multipurpose water supply system that runs adjacent to \nthe plant. The KMC is also connected to the Talimarjan Reservoir located 8 km south of the \nplant (1.5 billion m3 capacity), which can serve as a water supply source in times of shortage. \n                                                 \n7  Detailed due diligence reports are referenced in the list of linked documents (Appendix 2). \n ", "    7\n \n29.  The  CCGT  technology  is  the  most  efficient  and  cleanest  power  generation  option \ncurrently available. A CCGT plant can achieve efficiency levels of up to 60%. It uses (i) a gas \nturbine (similar to an aircraft jet engine) burning natural gas, with air to drive a generator and \nproduce  electric  power;  (ii)  a  HRSG,  which  recovers  more  of  the  energy  released  by  the \ncombustion process that occurs in the gas turbine; and (iii) a steam turbine, which uses the \nsteam produced in the HRSG to generate more power. CCGT systems are a well-established \ntechnology and are typically supplied as package items. The design of the CCGT plant is \nintended to ensure safe and efficient operation in different operating modes including start-up, \nfull-load, load-change, shut-down, and emergency shut-down. This is achieved through the \noptions of closed- and open-cycle operation, the selection of thermal plant operating pressures \nand temperatures, steam turbine configurations, and the control systems. The efficiency of the \ntwo CCGT units for the project is 57.4% (this compares to 34%\u201337% for steam-cycle unit 1).  \n \n30.  There will be an associated power transmission facility comprising a 500 kV single-circuit \ntransmission  line  (218  km)  from  Talimarjan  TPP  to  Sogdiana  substation,  and  a  500  kV \nsubstation adjacent to Talimarjan TPP. This will increase power evacuation and transmission \ncapacity, and strengthen the transmission system reliability. The facility will be commissioned by \n2013, and will be financed by the World Bank and Uzbekenergo. The safeguards due diligence \nand actions plans for this investment will follow World Bank guidelines.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n31.  The project is economically and financially viable. The economic internal rate of return is \n20.3%.  The  economic  benefits  are  calculated  by  weighting  the  project's  contribution  to \nincremental  (increased  electricity  consumption)  and  non-incremental  (energy  savings  and \ncarbon emission reduction) aspects. The sensitivity tests indicate robustness under all tested \nassumptions. The financial internal rate of return is 6.3% and exceeds a weighted average cost \nof capital of 0.3%. Nonquantifiable financial benefits, such as the quality of power supply, were \nnot included in the financial analysis. The estimated cost-recovery tariff level is $0.037/kilowatt-\nhour (kWh). The project is viable under all sensitivity tests (capital cost, fuel cost, and revenue). \n \n32.  The financial performance of Uzbekenergo has been strong, especially over the last 5 \nyears. The company has achieved high profitability, has a low debt ratio, and an accelerated \ndepreciation of fixed assets. Most of the fixed assets are inherited as equity, not as debt, and \ntheir residual value has been depreciated. The liquidity level is high, due to a good policy and \nperformance on receivables and account payables. \n \n33.  The financial projections for 2010\u20132015 incorporate Uzbekenergo's investment plan for \nnew  power  facilities,  with  total  investment,  including  for  this  project,  of  some  $4  billion. \nOperating costs are contained and the income projections point towards a strong financial base \nand high creditworthiness, but the tariff will need to be adjusted to reflect the cost of services \nand inflation. \n \n34.  The government is committed to maintaining cost-of-service tariffs. Since 2004, the \nnominal electricity tariff has increased by 18%\u201320% per year. As the result, the per kWh retail \ntariff has risen by factor of three (from SUM20/kWh to SUM62/kWh, or from $0.018/kWh to \n$0.043/kWh) since 2004. The continued tariff increase above the rate of inflation of around 10% \nhas resulted in sustainable financial performance without recourse to direct subsidies.  \n \n35.  The  project  may  be  eligible  for  carbon  financing  under  the  Clean  Development \nMechanism (CDM). Estimates of carbon emission reduction potential based on available CDM \n ", "8     \nmethodology indicate an annual reduction of about 1.2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent \n(mtCO e). ADB is supporting Uzbekenergo with CDM processing through its Technical Support \n2\nFacility under the Carbon Market Initiative. ADB's Future Carbon Fund may purchase up to 50% \nof the emission reductions after the appropriate project registration and validation. \n \nC.  Governance \n36.  The government has undertaken a series of far-reaching measures on governance and \nanticorruption. These include (i) legal reforms to improve the fairness and effectiveness of \njudiciary and court systems; (ii) reform of public sector management, especially public financial \nmanagement  and  tax  reforms;  (iii)  de-monopolization  to  open  opportunities  for  the  private \nsector; and (iv) more efficient and transparent procurement procedures. The government is also \nactive in international anticorruption activities. In 2008, it approved a bill to enter the United \nNations  Anti-Corruption  Convention.  A  comprehensive  governance  assessment  will  be \nconducted under ADB's new country partnership strategy, which will start in 2010. \n \n37.  A financial management assessment of Uzbekenergo, the executing agency, found it \nhas sound financial and accounting systems, procedures and policies, and has adopted accrual \naccounting, double entry bookkeeping and other generally accepted accounting principles and \nconventions  in  compliance  with  current  national  standards.  Capacity  development  under  the \nproject  will  strengthen  Uzbekenergo's  financial  management  capability,  as  well  as  overall \naccounting and auditing practices.  \n \n38.  Uzbekenergo's procurement capacity was also assessed. It has experience in working \nwith other multilateral and bilateral financiers. It is implementing two similar CCGT power plant \nprojects. Procurement lessons from these projects will be applied to this project. Procurement in \nany  case  will  follow  ADB's  guidelines,  including  the  use  of  standard  bidding  documents. \nUzbekenergo is not yet familiar with all ADB requirements and needs hands-on support, which \nwill be provided through an international consultant engaged under technical assistance.8 An \nearly  warning  system  will  be  established  to  ensure  timely  procurement  and  project \nimplementation.  \n  \n39.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and Uzbekenergo. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n40.  The household electrification rate is almost 100%. However, power supply gaps are \naffecting households' socioeconomic activities. Gender stereotypes are reinforced through the \nelectricity shortage, because women must spend more time on household tasks and cannot \nengage in income generating and educational activities. The project will increase the supply of \nreliable power to all customers, which will benefit the population, and improve living conditions \nand job opportunities. \n \n41.  Uzbekenergo will implement a community and gender action plan focusing on Talimarjan \nTPP employees and surrounding communities. A social and gender specialist in the project \nmanagement unit will provide support. Several social support programs will be implemented, \nincluding building of a community service center. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Uzbekistan for Preparing the Talimarjan Power Generation \nand Transmission Project. Manila. \n ", "    9\n42.  The influx of foreign and local workers during the construction period might increase the \nrisk of HIV/AIDS or other communicable diseases in the affected communities. Gender sensitive \nHIV/AIDS awareness campaigns will be initiated by Uzbekenergo for all construction workers, in \ncollaboration with the town administration at the local community. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n43.  The  project's  safeguards  classifications  and  requirements  are  as  follows:  (i) \nenvironment\u2014category A (environmental impact assessment), (ii) involuntary resettlement\u2014\ncategory C (no action), and (iii) indigenous peoples\u2014category C (no action).  \n \n44.  An environmental impact assessment has been prepared and was disclosed on 15 \nDecember 2009. Two rounds of public consultations were held prior to project appraisal. The \nenvironmental sensitivity of the project site and its surroundings is low. The town of Nuristan \n(home to employees of the Talimarjan TPP) is the only community close to the plant; the \nnearest other settlements are over 5 km away. Large parts of the surrounding area have been \ndeveloped for irrigated agriculture; undeveloped areas consist of Karshi steppe, which is made \nup  of  semi-desert  scrublands.  The  project's  key  environmental  issues  are  air  quality  and \nemissions, noise impacts on the Nuristan settlement, and water management. The project will \ncontribute to the process of closing older inefficient plants, which will reduce the amount of \ncarbon dioxide (CO ) produced from power generation. CCGTs fueled by natural gas produce \n2\nsignificantly lower amounts of CO  and nitrogen oxide (NOx) than do oil- or coal-fired plants, \n2\nand negligible amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO ). They typically have 35% lower fuel consumption \n2\nthan conventional TPPs and require less water. Dispersion modeling has done to assess the \npossible impacts of NOx. ADB has agreed with the State Committee for Nature Protection on \nthe acceptable discharge limits for CCGTs. \n \n45.  Water is taken from the KMC in summer and a single pass cooling process is used. \nWater is then discharged back into the canal. The thermal plume is cooled to within 5\u00b0C of the \nintake temperature within 500 meters. A closed system is used in winter whereby water is \nsprayed into lagoons for cooling before being returned to the plant. The method for cooling the \nnew plant will be designed during the engineering stage. There is sufficient water supply in the \ncanal to meet the additional demand without impacting downstream water users. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n46.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4. \n \nTable 4: Summary Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement delays  An international consultant under the project preparatory technical \nassistance is supporting Uzbekenergo in the preparation of bidding \ndocuments and evaluation of bids.  \nProject management  A PMU is staffed with qualified personnel. An implementation \nconsultant will help with construction supervision, contract \nmanagement, financial management, safeguards monitoring, and \nreporting. ADB will train Uzbekenergo in PPMS and disbursement.  \nSafeguards  Uzbekenergo staff will be trained. Sufficient funds have been \nallocated for environmental management. The EPC contractor's \nperformance will be monitored by Uzbekenergo, the implementation \nconsultant, the State Committee for Nature Protection of \nUzbekistan, and ADB. \n ", "10    \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nDelay in associated power  The PMU will manage the project and the associated power \ntransmission facility   transmission facility.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n47.  The government and Uzbekenergo have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government and Uzbekenergo have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements.  \n \n48.  ADB  loans  will  not  become  effective  until  after  a  loan  agreement  between  the \ngovernment and JICA becomes effective. Loans proceeds will not be disbursed until after the \nfollowing loan agreements (which must be satisfactory in form and substance to ADB) have \nbecome effective in accordance with their terms: (i) loan agreement between the UFRD and a \ndesignated commercial bank and a related subsidiary loan agreement between such bank and \nUzbekenergo; and (ii) subsidiary loan agreements between the government and Uzbekenergo \nfor the relending of the loans from ADB and JICA. \n \nV.
