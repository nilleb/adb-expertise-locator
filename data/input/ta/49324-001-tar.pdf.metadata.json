INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strengthening  the  microfinance  industry  to  advance  financial  inclusion  is  a  key \ncomponent of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and aligns with India\u2019s \nNational Financial Inclusion Strategy and the priority sector guidelines of the Reserve Bank of \nIndia (RBI).1  \n \n2.  In 2010, ADB developed the regional Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee \nProgram (MFP) to encourage international and domestic financial institutions to increase local \ncurrency lending to microfinance institutions (MFIs) through risk participation and guarantee \narrangements. As of 30 April 2016, 16 Indian MFIs had received assistance under the MFP, \nsupporting more than 2 million borrowers, primarily women in rural areas. However, a large \nnumber  of  smaller  MFIs  still  need  institutional  strengthening  support  to  grow  sustainably, \nprovide responsible financial services to the poor, and access commercial local funding. \n \n3.  The  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  will  address  sustainable  growth  in  the  microfinance \nindustry, including concerns regarding overindebtedness and consumer protection of clients and \npotential clients, who are mostly based in rural areas and typically have low financial literacy \nand capacity. It will support partner MFIs in managing their growth responsibly by providing \ncapacity  building  related  to  but  not  limited  to  consumer  protection,  risk  management, \ngovernance,  internal  controls,  and  credit  processes.  The  TA  will  also  build  the  financial \ncapabilities of MFI clients and develop knowledge products and impact stories that can be \ndisseminated for the benefit of nonparticipating MFIs. \n \n4.  The  TA  was  discussed  with  MFIs,  microfinance  networks,  and  partner  financial \ninstitutions (PFIs). The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.   Since  2010,  the  RBI  has  introduced  measures  to  mitigate  risk  and  improve  MFIs\u2019 \nbusiness practices, such as anti-money laundering and know your customer guidelines, the Fair \nPractices Code, and regulations on pricing of credit.3 Obligatory reporting to the credit bureaus \nand linking clients to the Aadhaar cards provide important information on clients\u2019 borrowing to \nprevent  overindebtedness.4 The  industry  has  also  strengthened  self-regulation  through  the \nMicrofinance Institutions Network (MFIN).5 Implementing these measures has helped restore \nconfidence in the sector and increase funding from banks and other financial institutions since \n2013. This is critical since MFIs are non-deposit taking. Access to finance in India is improving \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Aapka  Aadhaar.  https://uidai.gov.in/aapka-\naadhaar.html. A client cannot obtain more than two loans in total, whether they are from one or two MFIs. \n5  MFIN is recognized by RBI as the industry\u2019s self-regulatory body and ensures responsible lending and client \nprotection among NBFC-MFIs. http://mfinindia.org  \n ", "2 \n \nthrough various government initiatives6 and increased private sector lending, but it remains \nconstrained, particularly for underserved segments. Access to credit is even more limited, with \nless than 14% of borrowers accessing credit through formal channels.7 As a result of these \ninitiatives and high demand, new MFIs are being launched and existing MFIs are expanding \ngeographic coverage. \n \n6.  A total of 69 licensed nonbanking financial company (NBFC)\u2013MFIs were registered with \nthe RBI as of November 2015.8 As of December 2015, the gross loan portfolio of the industry \nwas Rs423.31 billion, representing 84% growth from the previous year. The industry services \nabout  28.8  million  clients  in  30  states  across  the  country.9 According  to  industry  reports, \nmicrofinance lending is used for agriculture activities (33%); non-agriculture (service, trade, and \nmanufacturing\u201442%);  and  household  finance  (education,  home  improvement,  and  other \nhousehold finance\u201425%) (footnote 9). The average loan size is Rs14,685. More than 95% of \nclients and borrowers are women,  reflecting the significant gender aspect in microfinance. \nFunding totaling Rs276.82 billion as of December 2015 facilitated strong growth in the industry, \nwhich is quite concentrated, with the 10 largest MFIs comprising 72% of assets. These MFIs \nalso receive the majority of funding (77%), while small and medium-sized MFIs face difficulties \nin accessing funding for growth and expansion. Commercial, local currency funding will be \nnecessary to increase access to credit and other services through formal channels. \n  \n7.  While the industry has experienced impressive growth in 2014 \u2013 2015 and remains quite \ndynamic  (enabled  through  a  sound  regulatory  environment,  new  business  models,  and \ninnovative technologies), these achievements do not come without challenges. MFI penetration, \nfor example in south India, has been increasing, especially since many MFIs are broadening \ntheir branch network to cover more geographic locations across the country, which could result \nin  geographical  overlapping  of  some  MFIs.10 The  impressive  growth  rates  and  ambitious \nexpansion plans need to be managed well to ensure MFIs can continue to provide responsible \nfinancial services and manage growth sustainably. It requires institutional and management \ncapacities to implement new business plans; establish strong processes; train front-end staff on \nnew requirements, products, and procedures; make use of suitable technologies to operate \nefficiently; and manage and monitor resulting risks.  Risk management will become crucial, \nespecially among the smaller and younger MFIs. Capacity development across operational, \nmarket, and liquidity issues will be important for these MFIs to implement realistic business \nplans, maintain good portfolio quality, and manage liquidity risks. By strengthening these areas, \na  broader  set  of  MFIs  will  be  able  to  obtain  funding  for  growth,  responsibly  reach  more \nunderserved customers, and introduce responsible yet innovative products. \n \n                                                \n6  Among others, the Government of India launched a highly successful program to open bank accounts for the \nunbanked (Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana). As of March 2016, more than 214 million accounts had been \nopened under the scheme. During TA implementation, where suitable, TA activities will be designed to complement \nor be linked to government programs to ensure benefits for clients. \n7  World Bank. The Global Findex Database 2014. http://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/globalfindex (accessed \n2 June 2016). Of people who had borrowed money in 2014, 27% borrowed from private moneylenders and the rest \nborrowed from family or friends. \n8  RBI. Non Banking Financial Companies (NBFCS). https://rbi.org.in/scripts/BS_NBFCList.aspx (accessed 2 \nJune 2016). The total number of MFIs is anticipated to be  more than 3,000, many of which are not licensed or \noperate as a society, trust, section 25 company (a type of nonprofit company), or cooperative. \n9  MFIN.  Micrometer  (data  as  of  31st  Dec  2015).  Haryana.  http://mfinindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ \nMicrometer-Issue-16_Q3-FY-15-16_19th-Feb-2016_for-dissemination-among-members.pdf  (accessed  2  June \n2016).  \n10  Previously, MFIs were state or regionally focused. \n ", "3 \n \n8.  Ensuring that MFIs provide responsible financial services and that clients have the \nfinancial  capability  to  understand  product  features  and  the  responsibilities  that  come  with \nfinancial services will be equally important, especially since MFI clients are typically from the \nlarge, often poor, and underserved segments of the population. The geographical expansion of \nsome MFIs makes it easier for clients to choose their financial services provider or obtain \nproducts beyond the traditional short-term small loan. Many MFIs have started to increase their \nloan ticket size in line with RBI guidelines. Consumer protection has been given much more \nimportance with the establishment of a framework in the RBI\u2019s Fair Practices Code. However, \nwhile many MFIs are committed to consumer protection, smaller ones often lack the knowledge \nand/or resources to put such principles in place, so implementation can be slow. \n \n9.  While MFIs try to meet clients\u2019 needs with new products, this does not automatically \ntranslate into effective use. The introduction and use of new technologies, such as mobile \nphone banking or agent banking, have created some institutional efficiency gains at MFIs. \nHowever, the use of agents also leapfrogs the step of interacting with a physical bank branch \n(or center meetings) and makes the integration of the previously unbanked into the formal \nfinancial system more challenging. Consumer education needs reinforcement to ensure that \nclients make informed decisions, and that their interest and money are protected. \n \n10.  Capacity building and institutional strengthening for tier 2 (small and medium) MFIs11 \nthrough the TA are important so that they can be supported through the MFP, and for PFIs to be \ncomfortable to provide local currency funding. This support would provide the opportunity for \nsmaller MFIs to scale up their operations and provide finance responsibly. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact is aligned with India\u2019s National Financial Inclusion Strategy, the RBI\u2019s priority \nsector guidelines, and ADB\u2019s strategic priorities for deepening financial inclusion.12 The outcome \nwill be improved access to responsible financial services in India.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be implemented in two phases and will focus on four key output areas: (i) on-\nsite support for institutional strengthening in selected partner MFIs provided, (ii) partner MFIs \nsupported  in the  implementation  of consumer  protection  principles,  (iii)  workshops for  MFI \nclients or potential clients on effective use of financial services provided, and (iv) information \nmaterial on program results disseminated.  \n \n13.  During phase 1, ADB will work closely with partner institutions under the MFP and MFIN \nin the selection of MFIs. The selection criteria are as follows: \n(i)  The MFI should be a licensed NBFC\u2013MFI in India. \n(ii)  The MFI should have a portfolio of at least $15 million. \n(iii)  The MFI\u2019s management should be committed to improving the operations and \nimplementation of consumer protection principles. \n                                                \n11 MFIN classifies MFIs by their gross loan portfolio. Small MFIs have a gross loan portfolio of up to Rs1 billion, \nmedium MFIs have a portfolio of Rs1 billion\u2013Rs5 billion, and large MFIs have a portfolio of more than Rs5 billion. \n12 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila; \nand footnote 1. \n ", "4 \n \n(iv)  The MFI meets the due diligence criteria of ADB\u2019s partner institution, including \nsatisfactory integrity due diligence checks. \n \n14.  Phase 2 of the TA will start after the partner institutions select the MFIs and identify their \nweaknesses. The key activities of the TA related to output 1 depend on the capacity needs of \nthe  MFIs  identified  during  phase  1.  These  will  likely  be  (i)  corporate  governance;  (ii) risk \nmanagement and internal controls; (ii) management reporting and control, in particular related to \noperational risk issues (e.g., portfolio and liquidity); (iii) portfolio management functions; and (iv) \ninstitutional processes and procedures and related staff and management capacities. \n \n15.  Under output 1, the following activities are likely to take place: \n(i)  Prepare and agree the work plan and milestones with selected MFIs that improve \nweaknesses and support sustainable growth. \n(ii)  Carry out capacity building activities for MFIs through workshops, training, and \non-the-job coaching in areas specified in the work plan, such as: \n(a)   providing  training  to  board  and  senior  management  on  governance, \nbusiness planning, growth management, and related risk management \nissues (portfolio, liquidity); \n(b)   reviewing and improving, as necessary, credit management procedures; \n(c)   reviewing and improving risk monitoring and management reporting; and \n(d)   assessing the suitability of using technologies for the implementation of \nservice delivery channels. \n \n16.  Under  output  2,  the  responsible  delivery  of  financial  services  will  be  strengthened \nthrough  (i)  assessments  and  the  identification  of  weaknesses  in  the  implementation  of \nconsumer protection principles, (ii) support for the revision and implementation of relevant \npolicies, and (iii) coaching of staff in relationship management. \n \n17.  Output 3 will focus on educating consumers on improving their financial capabilities. This \nincludes (i) stocktaking of regionally available financial education material, including potential \nuse of local financial literacy centers; and (ii) rolling out of financial education workshops. \n \n18.  Through  output  4,  promotional  activities  such  as  distributing  brochures,  publishing \nimpact stories, and publicizing using other forms of media, will increase awareness on the \nimportance of responsible finance. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and $250,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund13 and \nadministered by ADB. Participating MFIs will contribute to the funding by providing staff time, \ntransportation, accommodation, per diem, office space for consultants (as necessary), workshop \nfacilities, and other miscellaneous cost for participants from their respective institutions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n13 Financing partner: the Government of Luxembourg. Financing will be on a front-loading basis. \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB, through the Private Sector Operations Department, will execute and implement the \nTA  and  will  be  responsible  for  all  technical  implementation  issues.14 The  Private  Sector \nFinancial Institutions Division of the Private Sector Operations Department will be the focal point \nand will work closely with the Department of External Relations for output 4. The TA will be \nimplemented after receiving a no-objection letter from the Government of India. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months from December 2016 to November 2019       \n(1\u20133 months for phase 1 and 33 months for phase 2). Phase 2 may start before phase 1 is \ncompleted  to  allow  for  the  sequencing  of  individual  MFI  support  and  the  preparation  of \nprocurement for consulting services. No consultant services are needed for phase 1, while an \nestimated 29 person-months of consulting services (22 national and 7 international) will be \nrequired for phase 2. A consulting firm will be selected for outputs 1\u20133 according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with simplified technical proposal. For output 4, consultants (a \nfirm or individuals) accredited by the Department of External Relations on an existing retainer \ncontract will be considered. Where possible, output-based contracts (lump sum) will be used. \nADB staff can be used as sector, thematic, or technical experts and resource persons.15 Their \ntravel-related expenses will be paid through the TA.16 Disbursements under the TA will be made \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. Since final areas for \ncapacity building will only be confirmed after the assessment of MFIs in phase 1, the terms of \nreference and consultant inputs are estimates only and might be revised within the approved \nbudget. \n \n22.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated against the activities, outputs, and outcome as \ndescribed in the design and monitoring framework. This will be through quarterly progress \nreports against specific milestones and deliverables to be achieved within a specified time \nperiod. Results, good practices, and lessons learned will be disseminated through one brown \nbag seminar through the Finance Sector Group, consultant reports, and impact stories. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund, and \n(ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nIndia for the Strengthening Financial Inclusion through Responsible Finance Practices project, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14  ADB may delegate parts of the TA to selected PFIs under the MFP in compliance with ADB procedures and after \nconsultation with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department. \n15 For example, to conduct a workshop with partner institutions on the selection of MFIs or to provide awareness to \npotential new MFIs on ADB\u2019s MFP. \n16 ADB, Budget, Personnel and Management Systems Department; and Strategy and Policy Department, 2013.
