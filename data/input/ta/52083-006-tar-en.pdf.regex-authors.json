THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The Government of the Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nhelp  finance  the  Malolos\u2013Clark  Railway  Project  (the  project).  The  project  will  support  the \nconstruction of the 51-kilometer (km) section of a new railway line connecting Metro Manila and \nthe regional center in Clark and the Clark International Airport, located in the Central Luzon \nRegion, around 100 km north of Manila. The new railway line will (i) provide affordable, reliable, \nand safe public transport; (ii) reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (iii) cut the journey time by \nhalf to less than one hour. It is proposed that the project will be financed by a multitranche \nfinancing facility with an indicative amount of $2 billion from regular ordinary capital resources. \nThe  project,  for  approval  in  2019,  is  included  in  the  Country  Operations  Business  Plan: \nPhilippines, 2018\u20132020 and will be cofinanced by Japan International Cooperation Agency \n(JICA).1 \n \n2.  Sector Context. In the Philippines, 98% of passenger transport and 55% of freight \ntransport are handled by the road sector. Railways are operated only in Metro Manila, where \ncurrently three urban rail lines with a total length of 44 km are transporting 350 million passengers \nannually (2016). In addition, the Philippine National Railway (PNR) operates a suburban railway \nfrom Tutuban to Alabang (28 km), transporting 21 million passengers annually (2016). The PNR \nceased operation of the railway service to the north in the 1980\u2019s; the rails have been removed \nbut right-of-way is available for the project. Considering the population size and density of Metro \nManila, the railway network is sparse, and the lack of high capacity public transport is one of the \nmain reasons for the road congestion in Metro Manila, which impacts productivity and slows the \neconomic growth. The air transport sector in the National Capital Region (NCR) has limited \ncapacity to satisfy the growing demand. The Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) and the \nClark International Airport (CIA) are the two major airports serving the NCR. Air passenger traffic \nhas increased at about 10% in recent years. NAIA was handling around 37 million passengers in \n2015,  which  is  beyond  the  designed  capacity  of  the  airport.  As  a  result,  NAIA  has  been \nincreasingly congested and expanding NAIA is constrained by its location within Metro Manila \nwith no space available for major additional infrastructure required. Development of the CIA, \nwhich was handling around 1.5 million passengers in 2017, may help to ease capacity constraints \nin the air transport sector and the capacity of CIA will therefore be increased to 12 million \npassengers per annum by 2022.2 To fully utilize the enhanced capacity of CIA, the connection to \nManila needs to be improved, including rail based public transport. \n \n3.  Alignment with a national strategy. The Project will support the national spatial strategy \n(NSS) of the Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2017\u20132022, which serves as the basis for \npolicies on urban and infrastructure development in accordance with AmBisyon Natin 2040.3 The \nNSS recognizes the role of cities as engines of economic growth and poverty reduction, and \ninfrastructure to provide efficient connective networks of sustainable communities. It aims to \ndecongest  Metro  Manila  and  direct  growth  to  other  key  areas  and  address  spatial  and \nsocioeconomic inequalities by linking lagging regions with leading ones, rather than advocating \nthe uniform dispersal of development. The Government\u2019s \u201cBuild, Build, Build\u201d Program in which \nthe Project is included, builds upon this national strategy. It aims to materialize ambitious goals \nof $158 billion infrastructure investment or 7.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2022. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Philippine Development Plan 2017\u20132022. Pasig City. \n ", "2 \n4.  The NSS, therefore, aims to develop hierarchical regional centers and clusters outside the \ncountry\u2019s metropolitan regions to enhance economic development with improved Infrastructure \nsuch as housing, health care, education, employment opportunities and connectivity between the \nhierarchical regional centers. The Central Luzon Region, where the project area with Clark, CIA \nand  New  Clark  City  is  located,  is  one  of  the growth  areas. The  New  Clark  city  is  under \ndevelopment to accommodate 1.2 million residents and 800,000 jobs in 2045 to become an \nadministrative center for the country. The connection is supposed to be provided by a suburban \nrail and an expressway. 4 The North Luzon Expressway has been developed with 4\u20138 lanes, there \nis however no suburban rail service in this section and the only mode of public transfer to commute \nbetween NCR and Clark City, CIA and New Clark City is by bus. \n \n5.  Strategic Context. The NSS builds on integration of leading and lagging areas and urban-\nrural linkages through transportation networks. Regional center development will be supported \nwith suitable physical and human infrastructure including affordable housing, quality education, \nand healthcare, other social and economic services, and efficient urban management. The \nGovernment therefore develops New Clark City in Central Luzon as one of these regional centers \nwith the CIA as a regional gateway. The railway network will be the backbone public transport \nsystem to New Clark City and CIA. Extending the railway network within Manila will help to \ndecongest roads and reduce the high transport and logistics cost. \n \n6.  Road Map. Development of Clark as regional centers is in line with the NSS and will help \nto achieve the targets for accelerated economic growth. To provide access to Clark and CIA, the \nrailway network will be established. The Malolos\u2013Clark Railway is part of this railway network \nconnecting New Clark City with Manila and Calamba. An extension for long-haul services to \nSouthern Luzon will connect Manila with Legaspi City. To improve public transport in Manila, the \ngovernment  is  extending  two  metro  lines,  constructing  two  additional  lines  and  improving \ninterchanges between the different lines and improve intermodal integration with buses and other \nmodes of transport. The institutional capacity in the railway sector will be strengthened for efficient \nand timely planning, implementation, operation and maintenance of the expanded railway network. \n \n7.  Indicative outcome and impact. The impact of the proposed project is aligned with the \ntargets in the PDP to (i) strengthen GDP growth to 7%\u20138% to achieve upper middle-income status \nby 2022; (ii) develop regional growth centers; and (iii) improve local, national, and international \nconnectivity. The outcome will be an improved transport system in the Manila\u2013Clark corridor by \nrailway connection.  \n \n8.  Indicative output. The project will help to (i) finance the construction of a 51 km new \nrailway line with seven stations, integrating design features that are friendly to elderly people, \nwomen, children, and people with disabilities; (ii) improve the livelihood of project affected persons \nby a skills development program and (iii) support institutional strengthening of Department of \nTransportation (DOTr) for project and contract management. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n9.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government to prepare project \n                                                \n4  Japan International Cooperation Agency and National Economic Development Authority. 2014.

ADB\u2019s past involvement in the Philippine rail transport sector is limited. In 1976, ADB \napproved $24.2 million loan to rehabilitate track and bridges on the South Line of the PNR. \nDespite a time overrun of six years, the project was only 75% complete in 1986 when the ADB \nloan was fully disbursed. The project completion report diagnosed that PNR had fundamental, \ntechnical, organizational and operational weakness.6 ADB resumed support to the rail transport \nsector in 2017 with the Infrastructure Preparation and Innovation Facility (IPIF), which aims to \nsupport  capacity  development  and  preparation  of  detailed  design  for  transport  projects.7 \nSubsequently, a consulting team was recruited under the IPIF to support the DOTr in the \npreparation and implementation of this project. The TA will supplement support from the IPIF, \nwhich is focusing on design and project management for works contracts, with support in the \nwider railway sector capacity development. \n \n11.  Today, the DOTr is the primary transport sector agency, which oversees policies, planning, \noperations, regulations, and investments. This multiple roles of DOTr caused delays in project \ndefinition and implementation in the past. To ensure sustainability and efficiency in the transport \nsector, the PDP aims to eliminate this dual role of DOTr acting as operator and regulator by (i) \nadopting a National Transport Policy; (ii) creating an independent regulatory body for the transport \nsectors; and (iii) creating an independent body for transport safety. Under this framework, a \nprivate sector entity will be selected to operate and maintain the Malolos\u2013Clark Railway under a \nservice contract. All assets financed by ADB and JICA will be owned by DOTr. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n12.  Output 1: Project Implementation Support. Institutional capacity building will support \nDOTr in the project preparatory and early project implementation phase. Capacity development \nwill include (i) consulting services to support DOTr in carrying out land acquisition, resettlement \nand livelihood skills development activities for project affected persons; (ii) consulting services to \nsupport  procurement  activities,  (iii)  consulting  services  to  develop  and  implement  a  public \ncommunication strategy with project affected persons, other stakeholders and the wider public \nincluding  project  website;  (iv)  consulting  services  to  develop  and  implement  gender \nmainstreaming activities under the gender action plan; and (v) other support by consultants and \ntrainings as required to accelerate project implementation schedule. \n \n13.  Output  2:  Railway  Sector  Policy  Framework  Development.  This  component  will \nsupport  the  assessment  of  the  existing  transport  sector  policy  framework  with  focus  on \nestablishing a suitable regulatory framework and institutions to ensure reliable, inclusive, safe and \nsustainable operation of the project in 2022. The component will further support implementing any \nadjustments of the regulatory framework and establishing a safety regulator etc. as required to \nhandover operation and maintenance (O&M) of the railway system to a private sector entity will \nbe selected to operate and maintain the Malolos\u2013Clark Railway under a service contract. \n \n                                                \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 August 2018. \n6  ADB. 1987.

The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access \nto existing data and information, facilitation of liaisons with stakeholders, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer the TA. The Transport and Communications Division of the Southeast \nAsia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants. DOTr, the executing agency of \nthe government will provide necessary counterpart support and guide the implementation of the \nTA to achieve the TA outputs and desired outcomes within the agreed implementation period. \nThe TA implementation will comply with the JFPR Policy Guidelines regarding the utilization and \nadministration of the fund. \n \n18.
