An initial environmental examination for \nall subprojects will be undertaken during project implementation. \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  will  rehabilitate  public  infrastructure  damaged  by \nsevere landslides and floods during the spring and summer of \n2003. The affected infrastructure includes (i) roads and bridges, \n(ii) power distribution lines, and (iii) schools. The Project will also \nprovide municipal infrastructure in two resettlement centers that \nthe Government is establishing for disaster-affected people. \n   \nRationale  The  Project  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Rehabilitation \nAssistance After Disasters. There is an urgent need to help the \nGovernment  cope  with  the  disasters,  especially  given  the \ncountry\u2019s constrained fiscal situation. The Project will assist in \nrehabilitating  damaged  public  infrastructure,  and  ensure  that \nnatural disasters do not disrupt social and economic development \nin project areas. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The immediate purpose of the Project is to assist the Government \nto restore economic and social activity quickly in the communities \nof four oblasts (provinces) struck by landslides and floods by \nrehabilitating damaged public infrastructure. The long-term goal of \nthe  Project  is  to  help  sustain  economic  growth  and  poverty \nreduction in the country. The Project comprises four components: \n \nRoads  and  bridges.  Rehabilitating  five  damaged  roads  and \nrebuilding ten damaged bridges in the oblasts of Chui, Issyk-Kul, \nJalal-Abad, and Osh.  \n \nElectricity. Rehabilitating and rebuilding about 21 kilometers on \nfour damaged power distribution lines, as well as replacing three \nelectrical transformer stations in the oblasts of Chui and Osh. \n \nSchools.  Building  four  schools  and  providing  furniture  and \nfacilities in areas less prone to natural disasters in the oblasts of \nChui and Osh. \n \nMunicipal Infrastructure. Building municipal infrastructure (on-\nsite roads, power lines, water supply, and drainage systems) in \ntwo  permanent  resettlement  centers  that  the  Government  is \nestablishing for disaster-affected people in Osh. \n \n ", "ii   \n   \nCost Estimates  The  Project  is  estimated  to  cost  $6.3  million  equivalent, \ncomprising $3.8 million (59.8%) in foreign exchange cost and \n$2.5 million equivalent (40.2%) in local currency cost.  \n   \nFinancing Plan   \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total   Percent \nExchange   Currency  \n  ($\u2019000)     \nAsian Development  3,754    1,246    5,000    80   \nBank  \nGovernment  0    1,275    1,275    20   \n         Total  3,754    2,521    6,275    100   \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A  loan  in  various  currencies  equivalent  to  SDR3,492,000  \n($5 million equivalent) will be provided from the Special Funds \nresources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The loan will \nhave a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with \nan interest charge of 1% per annum during the grace period and \n1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2007 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2007 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations (MEES) \n   \nImplementation  There will be two implementing agencies for the Project: MEES \nArrangements  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC). \nMEES will be responsible for implementing school and municipal \ninfrastructure subprojects, while MOTC will handle implementation \nof roads, bridges, and electricity subprojects. There will be two \nproject  implementation  units  (PIUs).  The  Government  will \nestablish a new PIU in MEES and will use the existing PIU in \nMOTC  under  the  ADB-funded  Road  Rehabilitation  Project.  \nPIUs will be responsible for day-to-day project coordination and \nimplementation.  A  project  steering  committee,  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  concerned  government  ministries  and \nagencies,  will  be  established  to  supervise  overall  project \nimplementation. \n \nProcurement  Advance  action  on  procurement  for  civil  works  has  been \napproved.  Retroactive  financing  has  also  been  approved  for \neligible expenses incurred and paid from 8 September 2003 (the \nfirst day of ADB\u2019s fact-finding mission) until loan effectiveness, \nsubject to a maximum amount of $1.0 million equivalent and the \nBoard approval of the proposed loan. All ADB-financed goods and \n \n ", "  iii \n  services  will  be  procured  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement through local competitive bidding for civil works and \ndirect purchase for equipment. \n   \nConsulting Services  A total of 136 person-months of consulting services, comprising \n12  person-months  of  international  and  124  person-months  of \ndomestic  consultants,  will  be  provided  to  help  implement the \nProject.  Consultants  will  help  project  management,  detailed \ndesign reviews, quality control, preparation of bidding documents, \nbid evaluation, construction supervision, and environmental and \nsocial impact monitoring. Consultants will be engaged according \nto  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit disaster-affected communities in \nBeneficiaries  four oblasts by rehabilitating and rebuilding roads and bridges, \nrestoring  power  supply,  renewing  access  to  education,  and \nbuilding municipal infrastructure for the Kurshab-1 and Dubitel \npermanent resettlement centers that the Government is setting up \nfor affected people. More than 128,000 people in 78 villages are \nexpected to benefit from the Project. The Project will benefit the \npoor because the majority of the population living in disaster-\naffected areas is poor.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  involves  four  risks.  First,  there  might  be \nimplementation delays because of MEES\u2019 limited capacity. Project \nconsultants  will  assist  MEES  in  managing  implementation. \nAdvance action on procurement, retroactive financing, and the \nadoption of local competitive bidding and direct purchase will help \nreduce  the  risk  of  delayed  procurement.  Second,  construction \nsupervision  may  be  inadequate  because  the  Project  covers \nseveral sectors and relatively small subprojects over a widespread \narea. This risk would be mitigated through adequate consulting \nservices. Third, counterpart funds may not be provided in a timely \nmanner. ADB will work closely with the Government to ensure that \nsufficient counterpart resources are allocated on a timely basis. \nADB financing for part of the local currency cost would alleviate \nthis  risk.  Fourth,  fresh  landslides  and  floods  may  damage \ncompleted project works. This risk would be mitigated through \ncareful design and new alignments to avoid areas at high risk of \nfuture  landslides  and  floods.  During  implementation,  ADB  will \ncoordinate  closely  with  the  World  Bank,  which  will  help  the \nGovernment develop disaster prevention measures.  \n   \n ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kyrgyz Republic for the Emergency Rehabilitation Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES1 \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The Kyrgyz Republic is a small, mountainous country (over 90% of the total territory is \nmountainous) and is vulnerable to natural disasters. Floods and landslides are major concerns \nbecause of monsoon rains, seismic activity, steep slopes, fragile soils, and human action.  \nSuch natural disasters would cause damage to inhabitants and physical  infrastructure, thus \nposing a threat to the country\u2019s economic and social development. Effective response to natural \ndisasters to minimize the damage is one of the major challenges faced by the country. \n \n3.  Roads. The country is landlocked, and road transport accounts for about 94% of freight \nmovement and almost all passenger traffic. The country\u2019s road network covers all seven oblasts \n(provinces),  and  provides  connections  to  far-flung communities and neighboring countries.  \nThe road network comprises about 18,900 kilometers (km) of roads: 9,900 km of state roads \nand 9,000 km of local roads, about 40% of which are sealed, 50% gravel, and 10% earth. Traffic \nhas fallen substantially since 1991 because of economic contraction following the breakup of \nthe former Soviet Union, although the transport recovered somewhat after 1995. In 2001 \npassenger and freight turnovers accounted for 57% and 20% of their respective 1990 levels.2 \nThe Government has made substantial efforts in road sector reform. All 29 road construction \nenterprises and 74 of 86 road transport service providers were privatized. Most national holding \ncompanies that had exercised control over transport operations were abolished. The market for \nfreight  transport  services  is  becoming  increasingly  competitive.  However,  the  Government \ncontinues to exert strong influence over intercity passenger transport and play a large role in \nfreight  transport  through  its  holdings  in  joint-stock  companies  and  its  regulation  capacity.  \nThe existing road network is adequate for the country\u2019s development needs; the major sector \nissue is proper rehabilitation and maintenance to preserve the existing network. The Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  actively  providing  assistance  to  improve  road  sector \nperformance.3 \n \n4.  Electricity. The country has a large hydroelectric potential with more than 163,000 \ngigawatt-hours  (GWh)  per  year,  of  which  less  than  10%  is  presently  exploited.  Primary \nelectricity production from hydropower accounts for more than 80% of the total energy output. \nThe country is a net exporter of electricity. In 2002, it generated 14,750 GWh compared with \ndomestic consumption of 11,500 GWh, with about 10% of annual production exported to \nneighboring countries. Following the split of the power monopoly, Kyrgyzenergo in 2001, there \nare six power sector comprises: one generation company (JSC Generation Stations), one \ntransmission company (JSC National Grid), and four distribution companies operating in the \noblasts of Chui and Talas, Osh, Jalal-Abad, and Naryn and Issy-Kul, respectively. About 98% of \nthe population is connected to the power grid. The Government has initiated power sector \nreform.  The  Energy  Law  was  enacted  to  provide  a  framework  for  sector  regulation  and \n                                                 \n1  The appendix on sector analysis is excluded due to the urgency of processing this Project. \n2  World  Bank.  2003.  Public  Expenditure  Review:  Fiscal  Policies  for  Growth  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Vol.  2. \nWashington D.C. \n3  ADB has provided four loans totaling $145 million and seven TA grants with a total amount of $4.2 million to the \nroad sector. \n ", "2  \nrestructuring, and power tariffs were raised from 0.6 cents/kilowatt-hour (kWh) in 1999 to 1.3 \ncents/kWh in 2002, with a view to bring the average tariff on par with the estimated long-term \naverage cost of 2.3 cent/kWh by 2005. However, the sector faces some major problems: (i) a \nhigh quasi-fiscal deficit because of technical and commercial losses, as well as low revenue \ncollection; and (ii) a rapid deterioration of facilities because of a lack of funds for operation and \nmaintenance. There is also a need to adopt an effective social protection scheme to mitigate the \nimpact of tariff increases on the poor. ADB has worked closely with the World Bank, which has \nplayed  a  coordinating  role  among  the  donors  in  supporting  energy  sector  reform  and \nrehabilitating the power system.4  \n \n5.  Education. The Kyrgyz education system comprises five principal levels of education \nand is based on the former Soviet system.  Government  statistics  indicate  that  the  gross \nenrollment ratio for primary education is 97.5% in 1998, with virtually identical rates for boys and \ngirls. School enrollment and educational quality have deteriorated over the past decade due to \nthe decline in income, depleted stocks of textbooks and other learning materials, an underpaid \nteaching force, and physical deterioration of schools. Although the Ministry of Education and \nCulture (MOEC) only reports 2,500 children out of school in 2001, independent estimates \nsuggest far higher figures.5 About 40% of respondent school children failed a literacy test in a \nrecent survey conducted by the United Nations. Education sector reform has been pursued \nsince 1992 with the promulgation of the Education Law. Major measures adopted include  \n(i) new curriculum, textbooks, and learning materials; (ii) stronger pupil assessment and teacher \ntraining; (iii) delegated responsibility for management and financing of primary and secondary \nschools  to  local  bodies;  and  (iv)  upgraded  and  rehabilitated  facilities  and  equipment.  \nThe Government has recently developed a concept paper for education development to 2010, \nproviding  the  key  policy  and  strategic  framework  for  education.  Nevertheless,  the  sector \nexperiences several main problems: rising inequalities in access to, and declining quality of, \neducation  services;  low  teacher  motivation  due  to  low  salaries;  and  shortcomings  in  the \ndelegation of responsibilities for primary and secondary schools to local bodies. ADB has been \nthe  main  source  of  external  assistance  to  the  education  sector  since  the  country\u2019s \nindependence in 1991.6 \n \n6.  The country is experiencing severe fiscal and debt constraints, due to the accumulation \nof the public sector budget deficits during 1993- 1996 and the large devaluation of the som \nfollowing the Russian financial crisis during 1997- 1998. At the end of 2002, the country\u2019s \nexternal debt stock was equivalent to about $1.8 billion (111% of gross domestic product \n[GDP]), of which about $1.6 billion were public or government-guaranteed loans.7 The large \nexternal debt has become an excessive burden on the fiscal system, severely restricted the \nGovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  borrow  abroad,  and  limited  its  ability  to  effectively  respond  to \nemergency needs with its own resources.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1996.

The Kyrgyz Republic suffered from severe landslides and floods during the spring and \nsummer of 2003 due to heavy rains. The Government\u2019s meteorological records show that \nrainfall in the oblasts of Jalal-Abad and Osh from March- June 2003 was on average about 50% \nhigher than in normal years (Table 1), and over 30 millimeters (mm) of precipitation fell in a one-\nhour period in Chui oblast on 21 June 2003, a record high. Rivers and streams broke their \nbanks under the increased water volume and silt load. Torrential rains also triggered landslides \nbecause soils were saturated by the rains and slid down steep slopes. About 1,000 landslides \noccurred during the first eight months of 2003, compared with an average of 15- 20 landslides \nduring the similar period in a normal year. \n \nTable 1: Rainfalls in Osh and Jalad-Abad Oblasts (March-June 2003)  \nCompared with Normal Years  \n(%)  \n \n  2003 \nArea  March  April  May  June  Average \n(March-June) \nOsh Oblast           \n   Ak-Terek   110.7  171.3  164.4  145.2  147.9 \n   Batken  198.8  277.0  106.1  310.8  223.0 \n   Kara-Suu  170.0  273.6  168.0  263.8  218.9 \n   Nookat  152.4  183.6  121.1  335.5  198.2 \n   Uzgen   127.3  237.2  111.3  154.1  157.5 \nJalal-Abad Oblast  120.5  234.7  107.5    76.1  134.7 \nSource: Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations.  \n \n8.  The landslides and floods of 2003 have caused the country\u2019s worst damage since 1994. \nAccording to the Government, 43 people were killed, 1,088 families lost their houses, around \n6,000  hectares  of  agricultural  land  were  damaged,  and  more  than  300,000  people  were \naffected. Total damage cost more than Som566 million ($13.5 million), almost 1% of GDP. \nNatural disasters also destroyed or severely damaged roads, bridges, power lines, irrigation \nfacilities, schools, and hospitals. An assessment of the damage to roads, bridges, power \ndistribution facilities, and schools is provided below. \n \n9.  Roads and bridges. About 55.5 km of roads and 21 bridges were destroyed or severely \ndamaged. The damage was particularly serious in the oblasts of Chui, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. In \nOsh, huge landslides buried parts of the Kurshab-Jalpaktash asphalt road and the PAD-Budalyk \ngravel road, and significantly damaged the Chalma-Buyga road. In Chui, mudslides destroyed \nthree bridges and about 2 km of the Natural Park Ala-Archa road. Floods also washed away \nnumerous sections of the Barpy-Yrisuu-Changent road in Jalal-Abad, and destroyed the bridges \non the Ilichevka-Erkintoo road in Osh and the Sovetskaya-Syrzavod road in Issyk-Kul. \n \n10.  Electricity. About 57 km of 35-, 10-, and 0.4-kilovolt (kV) power lines and nine electrical \ntransformer stations were damaged in Chui and Osh oblasts. In the Uzgen district of Osh, \nlandslides and mudslides buried the 35-kV Uzgen-Zerger and Mirza-Aki-Salamalik overhead \nlines and several 10-kV overhead lines. Floods and mudslides also partly destroyed the 10-kV \nGulcha-Sopu-Korgon  overhead  line  in  Alay  district,  and  damaged  several  10-  and  0.4-kV \noverhead lines and transformer stations in the districts of Karasuu, Chon-Alay, and Ksara-Kulja. \n ", "4  \nIn Chui, eight 35- and 10-kV lines and three transformer stations were seriously damaged by the \nmudslides. Many communities lacked electricity.  \n \n11.  Schools. Thirty-two schools were destroyed or damaged, particularly in the oblasts of \nChui, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. A number of school buildings collapsed, while others severely \ndeteriorated as a result of heavy rains: the foundations of the buildings subsided and the walls \nare saturated with serious cracks. The Ministry of Ecology and Emergency Situations (MEES) \nhas declared these school buildings \u201cunsafe\u201d, and ordered them to be vacated. Currently, \nchildren  are  studying  in  tents  or  other  temporary  locations  such  as  kindergartens,  with \novercrowded and unheated classrooms. Because some damaged schools are located in areas \nat high risk of future landslides and floods, new schools need to be built in safer areas. \n \n12.  Damage to public infrastructure severely disrupted economic activity and social life in \naffected communities. The destruction of roads and bridges isolated thousands of people and \nhampered their access to food, drinking water, electricity, medical supplies, education, and \nhealth care. Some temporary roads have been formed and electricity restored using makeshift \npower lines, but these are vulnerable and even rainfall can destroy them. As the new school \nyear began in September and winter has set in, damage to schools has disrupted normal \nlearning and caused significant stress to children, teachers, and parents. There is an immediate \nneed to rehabilitate and rebuild damaged infrastructure so as to restore economic and social \nactivity in disaster-affected communities.  \n \n13.  The Government responded actively in the aftermath of the natural disasters. On 13 May \n2003 the Government issued a resolution (No. 277) for urgent relief operations, and it has since \nmobilized its forces or contractors to restore essential services in affected areas. As of the end \nof August 2003, a total amount of Som174.1 million (about $4 million) had been allocated from \nthe state budget to government ministries and agencies to support relief and rehabilitation. \nThe Government also provided grants of Som379,000 (about $9,000) per household for victims \nof the most disastrous landslide in the Kara-Taryk village of Osh.8  The  Government  also \nextended long-term, interest-free credit9 of up to Som200,000 ($4,700) to each of other affected \nfamilies to help relocate them to safer areas and allocated land for permanent resettlement \ncenters. MEES is building two new resettlement centers (Kurshab-1 Resettlement Center10 and \nDubitel Resettlement Center11) in Osh with government funding and it plans to build a third \n(Kurshab-2 Resettlement Center12). Because of the country\u2019s severe fiscal constraints, the \nGovernment has the limited capacity to respond to the natural disasters and has therefore \nrequested emergency assistance from the international community. \n \n                                                 \n8  The largest landslide occurred in the village of Kara-Taryk, Uzgen district of Osh on 20 April 2003. The landslide \ndevastated the village and killed 38 people.  \n9  The loans have a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 2 to 3 years.   \n10 The Kurshab-1 Resettlement Center has a total area of 5 hectares and is being built for 51 families affected by the \nmost disastrous landslide in the Kara-Taryk village. The center is located 25 km from Kara-Taryk village.12 families \nthat lost parents or most of their property were provided houses free of charge, while the remaining 39 families \nreceived  interest-free  loans  to  build  houses.  17  houses  have  been  completed  and  16  houses  are  under \nconstruction. \n11 The Dubitel Resettlement Center has a total area of 18 hectares and is being established for 55 affected families \nfrom Dubitel and Changet villages, 5- 10 km away. Four houses have been completed and 26 houses are under \nconstruction. \n12 The Kurshab-2 Permanent Resettlement Center is planned for 178 affected families to be relocated from the Aral \nand Ak-Terek areas, 55 km away. The Center has a total area of about 15 hectares and will be developed in two \nphases. \n ", "  5\n14.  There is an urgent need for ADB to help the Government cope with the natural disasters, \nespecially given its constrained fiscal situation. Such assistance is consistent with ADB\u2019s Policy \non Rehabilitation Assistance After Disasters and would enable the Kyrgyz Republic to continue \nits  development  expenditures  that  otherwise  would  have  been  reallocated  for  disaster \nrehabilitation. In recognition of this, ADB fielded a fact-finding mission from 8 to 19 September \n2003 following receipt of the Government\u2019s request for emergency assistance. The mission held \ndiscussions  with  the  central  and  concerned  local  governments,  affected  communities, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and other donor agencies. It also assessed the damage \nto public infrastructure. Based on the findings and understanding reached with the Government, \nthe  mission  prepared  an  emergency  rehabilitation  project  for  possible  ADB  support.  The \nproposed loan is within the limits on the country\u2019s public investment program required under the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s poverty reduction and growth facility.  \n \n15.  External Assistance and Aid Coordination. Other international aid agencies have also \nresponded to the country\u2019s natural disasters. The United Nations and the United States Agency \nfor International Development extended grants of $30,000 and $50,000, respectively, mainly in \nthe form of food, medicine, tents, and blankets. Japan, the European Commission, and the \nSwitzerland are providing grant assistance to strengthen the capacity of the central and selected \nlocal governments as well as local communities  to monitor, predict, and handle disasters. \nThe  World  Bank  plans  to  reallocate  $3  million  from  an  ongoing  irrigation  loan  project  to \nrehabilitate damaged irrigation facilities, and has programmed  a $5 million natural disaster \nmitigation project for 2004 to help  develop a program to address key natural resource and \nenvironmental risks, including the impact of rock slides on uranium tailings stored in the Mailuu \nSuu area. There has been close coordination between ADB and the World Bank in response to \nthe  Government\u2019s  request  for  emergency  assistance.  Based  on  ADB\u2019s  experience  in \ninfrastructure and the World Bank\u2019s involvement in the irrigation sector, it was agreed that ADB \nassistance would cover roads, bridges, power lines, schools, and municipal infrastructure while \nthe  World  Bank  would  rehabilitate  damaged  irrigation  facilities  and  help  address  disaster \nprevention issues.  \n \n16.  Lessons Learned. There are several important lessons learned from ADB operations in \nthe Kyrgyz Republic First, the Government\u2019s institutional capacity is generally limited by the \nfrequent  changes  in  staff,  shortages  of  managerial  and  technical  skills  in  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, as well as their limited familiarity with ADB\u2019s operational policies and \nprocedures. This has often led to delays in procurement, slow disbursements, and poor quality \nof work. Capacity building should be an integral part of ADB\u2019s lending assistance. Second, \ninadequate  counterpart  funding  has  recently  affected  ADB\u2019s  portfolio.  The  Government\u2019s \nbudgetary constraints and deficiency in its fiscal management system are the major factors, and \nthese factors have resulted in implementation delays. Counterpart funding for individual projects \nneeds close, regular monitoring.  \n \n17.  ADB\u2019s  previous  emergency  assistance  loans,  particularly  the  Flood  Emergency \nRehabilitation Project for the Kyrgyz Republic,13 the Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project14 \nand the Emergency Baipaza Landslide Stabilization Project for Tajikistan,15 have provided a \nnumber of useful lessons. First, a strong government commitment to rehabilitation is essential to \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1998.

Second, capacity building at executing and \nimplementing agencies is badly needed because their limited institutional capacity has been the \nmajor  factor  in  implementation  delays.  Third,  consulting  services  are  needed  to  ensure \nadequate  construction  supervision  and  project  quality,  given  limited  government  capacity. \nFourth, special attention should be paid to counterpart funding, as inadequate counterpart funds \nhave affected the smooth project implementation. These lessons have been incorporated into \nthe project design. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n18.  The immediate purpose of the Project is to assist the Government to restore economic \nand social activity quickly in the communities of four oblasts struck by landslides and floods by \nrehabilitating damaged public infrastructure. The long-term goal of the Project is to help sustain \neconomic growth and poverty reduction in the country. The project areas cover the oblasts of \nChui, Issyk-Kul, Jalal-Abad, and Osh. A project framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n19.  The Project comprises the following four components, the details of which are given in \nAppendix 2: \n \n(i)  Roads  and  bridges.  Rehabilitating  five  damaged  roads  and  rebuilding  ten \ndamaged bridges. The roads to be rehabilitated are the Natural Park Ala-Archa \nroad in Chui; the Kurshab-Jalpaktash, PAD-Budalyk, and Chalma-Buyga roads in \nOsh; and the Barpy-Yrissu-Changent road in Jalal-Abad. Four bridges on the \nBarpy-Yrissu-Changent road, three on the Natural Park Ala-Archa road, and one \nbridge  each  on  the  Illichevka-Erkintoo,  Chalma-Buyga,  and  Sovetskaya-\nSyrzavod roads will be rebuilt.  \n \n(ii)  Electricity. Rehabilitating and rebuilding about 21 km on four damaged power \ndistribution lines in Chui and Osh. Four damaged lines are (a) the 35-kV Uzgen-\nZerger line, (b) the 35-kV Mirza-Aki-Salamalik line, (c) the 10-kV Gulcha-Sopu-\nKorgon line, and (d) the 10-kV Ala Archa-25 Years of Kyrgyzstan Substation line. \nThree damaged transformer stations located along the Ala Archa-25 Years of \nKyrgyzstan Substation line will be replaced. \n \n(iii)  Schools. Building four schools in areas less prone to natural disasters in the \noblasts of Chui and Osh, including furniture and facilities. \n \n(iv)  Municipal Infrastructure. Building municipal infrastructure in the Kurshab-1 and \nDubitel  permanent  resettlement  centers  in  Osh,  which  the  Government  is \nestablishing for disaster-affected people. Municipal infrastructure includes about \n4.3 km of on-site roads, 8.6 km of power lines, two electric substations, 4.3 km of \nwater supply network, and about 1 km of drains. \n \n20.  The Project comprises 19 infrastructure subprojects, which have been selected from a \nlong list of 52 subprojects provided by the Government, based on priorities established by the \nGovernment and agreed upon by ADB. The major selection criteria are the severity of damage \nand the impact of damaged infrastructure on the affected communities.  \n ", "  7\n21.  The project components and output will be achieved through civil works, procurement of \nequipment,  and  consulting  services  for  project  management,  detailed  design  review, \nconstruction supervision, quality control, and social and environmental impact monitoring. \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n22.  The total project cost is estimated at $6.3 million equivalent, comprising $3.8 million \n(59.8%) in foreign exchange cost and $2.5 million equivalent (40.2%) in local currency cost.  \nThe cost estimates include physical and price contingencies, as well as taxes and duties.  \nA summary of cost estimates is in Table 2 and detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 3. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Project Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n   \nItem  Foreign  Local Currency   Total  \nExchange Cost  Cost  Project Cost \n(equivalent) \nA.

Financing Plan \n23.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan in various currencies equivalent \nto SDR3,492,000 ($5 million equivalent) from its Special Funds resources to finance the Project. \nThe proposed loan will finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $3.8 million and $1.2 million \nequivalent of local currency cost, or 80% of the total project cost. The provision of local cost \nfinancing is justified due to the Government\u2019s severe budgetary constraints and the urgency of \nthe  Project.  The  Government  will  meet  the  remaining  local  currency  cost  of  $1.3  million \nequivalent,  or  20%  of  the  total  project  cost.  Government  financing  will  cover  other  local \nexpenditures including taxes and duties. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period \nand 1.5% per annum thereafter. The Borrower will be the Kyrgyz Republic. The financing plan is \nsummarized in Table 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "8  \nTable 3: Summary of Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total Project  Percent \nExchange Cost  Currency Cost  Cost  \n(equivalent) \nAsian Development Bank  3,754    1,246    5,000    80   \nGovernment  0    1,275    1,275    20   \n        Total  3,754    2,521    6,275    100   \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n24.  MEES will be the executing agency for the Project and will be responsible for oversight \nand coordination of implementation. A vice minister of MEES will be appointed project director \nresponsible  for  implementation.  To  ensure  close  interagency  coordination  and  effective \nimplementation, the executing agency will be assisted by a project steering committee (PSC), \ntwo implementing agencies, and two project implementation units (PIUs). \n \n25.  PSC will be established at the central government level to supervise overall project \nimplementation. PSC will be chaired by the finance minister and will comprise representatives of \nconcerned government agencies, including the prime minister\u2019s office, MEES, MOEC, Ministry \nof  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC),  the  State  Committee  on  State  Property \nManagement and Attraction of Direct Investment, and project oblast governments. PSC will \nmeet  on  a  quarterly  basis  to  review  progress  and  provide  guidance,  as  necessary,  on \nimplementation. An organization chart of project implementation is provided in Appendix 4. \n \n26.  There will be two implementing agencies for the Project: MEES and MOTC. MEES will \nbe responsible for implementing municipal infrastructure and school subprojects, while MOTC \nwill handle roads, bridges, and electricity subprojects.  \n \n27.  There will be two PIUs, one each at MEES and MOTC. The Government will establish a \nnew  PIU  in  MEES,  and  will  use  the  existing  PIU  in  MOTC  under  the  ADB-funded Road \nRehabilitation  Project.  PIUs  are  responsible  for  day-to-day  project  coordination  and \nimplementation.  In  consultation  with  project  oblast  governments,  NGOs,  and  affected \ncommunities,  PIUs  will  coordinate  key  project  implementation  activities  such  as  detailed \nengineering design reviews, preparation of bidding documents, evaluation of bids, awarding of \ncontracts, construction supervision, clearance of environmental examinations, and monitoring of \nimplementation. A fulltime project manager will head each PIU, and will assist the project \ndirector for implementation.  \n \n28.  Due to the urgency of the Project, the Government has undertaken design works for \nmost of the subprojects. In addition to the technical viability of the Project, two major issues will \nneed to be taken into account during detailed design. First, emphasis will be placed on disaster \nprevention because the Kyrgyz Republic is vulnerable to natural disasters. Since the World \nBank and other donors will help the Government develop natural disaster prevention measures, \nADB will incorporate  their  disaster prevention proposals  into  project  design  as  much  as \npossible. Second, special attention will be paid to the analysis of alternatives and least-cost \nsolutions. Project consultants will review detailed designs and provide guidance, if necessary, to \n ", "  9\nthe  executing  agency,  implementing  agencies,  and  PIUs  to  ensure  that  the  design  of  all \nsubprojects is based on least-cost options, addresses rehabilitation needs, and meets medium-\nterm requirements of disaster prevention.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n29.  The Project will be implemented over 3 years, with the Project expected to commence in \nMarch 2004 and end by March 2007. A project implementation schedule is given in Appendix 5. \n \n3.  Procurement \n30.  Procurement of goods and services to be financed out of the proposed loan will be \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Because civil works contracts \nwill be small and scattered, and domestic contractors are capable of undertaking such works, \nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB will be followed. Equipment for schools, \nvalued at about $185,000 equivalent, will be procured by direct purchase. Contract packages \nare provided in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n31.  ADB has approved the Government\u2019s request for (i) advance action on procurement for \ncivil  works,  and  (ii)  retroactive  financing  for  eligible  expenses  incurred  and  paid  from  \n8 September 2003 (the first day of ADB\u2019s fact-finding mission) until loan effectiveness, and \nsubject to a maximum amount of $1.0 million equivalent (20% of the proposed loan) and the \nBoard approval of the proposed loan. These actions are required to expedite implementation. \nThe Government will carefully check related documents for retroactive financing before these \ndocuments  are  submitted  to  ADB.  The  Government  was  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of \nadvance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing the Project. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n32.  The  Project  will  require  136  person-months  of  consulting  services,  comprising  \n12 person-months of international and 124 person-months of domestic consultants, to assist \nimplementation,  including  detailed  design  reviews,  quality  control,  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  bid  evaluation,  construction  supervision,  and  environmental  and  social  impact \nmonitoring. One international consultant as project advisor/civil engineer will be engaged  for  \n12 person-months to (i) ensure the smooth and speedy start-up of project implementation,  \n(ii) oversee quality of project documentation, and (iii) provide guidance and training to PIU staff \non  implementation  matters.  The  service  of  the  international  consultant  will  be  provided \nintermittently over a 3-year period. ADB and the Government will jointly assess the need for \nadditional  consulting  services  during  project  reviews.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the selection of domestic consultants. In consultation with ADB, the \nimplementing agencies will recruit the international consultant, while the international consultant \nwill assist the implementing agencies in recruiting domestic consultants. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are provided in Appendix 7. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n33.  The proposed loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. To expedite loan disbursement, the Government will open an imprest account in a \n ", "10  \ncommercial bank agreed by ADB after loan effectiveness with an initial deposit of $500,000 \nequivalent. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. ADB\u2019s \nstatement of expenditures (SOE) procedure will be used for reimbursing eligible expenditures \nand liquidating advances provided into the imprest account. Any individual  payments to be \nreimbursed or liquidated under the SOE procedure will not exceed the equivalent of $50,000. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n34.  PIUs will maintain separate accounts for the Project. However, these will be coordinated \nand  consolidated  by  MEES,  which  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  financial  statements \naccording to international accounting standards for review by independent auditors acceptable \nto  ADB.  MEES  will  submit  certified  copies  of  the  audited  project  accounts  and  financial \nstatements to ADB within 6 months of the end of each fiscal year. The auditing services may be \nfinanced out of the proceeds of the proposed loan. \n \n35.  MEES  will  provide  quarterly  reports  to  ADB  on  progress  made  and  problems \nencountered during the period under review, the steps taken or proposed to remedy the \nproblems, and the proposed activities and expected progress during the following period. MEES \nwill submit environmental status reports to ADB twice a year during implementation. Before the \nconstruction of the ADB-financed subprojects in the two resettlements sites, MEES will prepare \nand  submit  to  ADB  a  resettlement  framework  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement and Handbook on Resettlement. Within 3 months of physical completion of the \nProject, MEES will submit to ADB a project completion report that provides details about \nimplementation, costs, benefits, and other information requested by ADB. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n36.  Each implementing agency will undertake performance monitoring for each subproject to \nevaluate the delivery and quality of the planned outputs, inputs, activities, and project benefits \nindicated in the project framework. Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, each implementing \nagency,  with  assistance  of  project  consultants,  will  develop  a  comprehensive  project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS) according to ADB\u2019s standards and submit it to ADB for \nreview. \n \n9.  Project Review \n37.  ADB will field a project inception mission shortly after loan approval to initiate the \nimplementation process, and will conduct project reviews of the overall progress of the Project \nat  least  twice  per  year.  If  the  results  of  project  reviews  indicate  serious  implementation \nproblems, the Government and ADB will agree on appropriate mitigation measures, including \nchanges in the scope of implementation arrangements, to ensure the realization of the project \nobjectives. The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a comprehensive midterm review in \n2005. The  midterm review will assess (i) implementation status, (ii) design and construction \nstandards,  (iii)  physical  progress  and  disbursements  made  against  the  implementation \nschedule, (iv) performance of consultants and contractors, (v) social and environmental impact \nmonitoring  results,  (vi)  status  of  compliance  with  the  covenants  stipulated  in  the  loan \nagreement, and (vii) the need for any additional works or changes in the project scope. \n \n ", "  11\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits \n38.  The Project will directly benefit disaster-affected communities in four oblasts of the \nKyrgyz  Republic.  The  project\u2019s  social  and  economic  benefits  include  rehabilitating  and \nrebuilding damaged roads and bridges, restoring disrupted power supply, building schools in \nless disaster-prone areas, and providing municipal infrastructure in permanent resettlement \ncenters that the Government is setting up for disaster-affected people. More than 128,000 \npeople living in 78 villages will benefit. The Project will particularly benefit the poor because the \nmajority of the population in disaster-affected areas is poor: the average poverty incidence for \nthe four project oblasts is 44%. A proposal for grant assistance from the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  is  being  processed  separately  to  help  reduce  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor \ncommunities in disaster-affected areas. From a long-term perspective, the Project will contribute \nto achieving sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction in the country. \n \n39.  The Project is designed to rehabilitate damaged public infrastructure in affected areas in \nthe shortest possible time. Given the relatively small size of individual subprojects, project \nbenefits are not quantified. Nevertheless, the Project is strongly justified because it will help \nrestore social and economic activity in disaster-affected communities. \n \nB.  Impacts \n40.  The Project will help bring social and economic life back to normal in disaster-affected \ncommunities. The rehabilitation of the damaged roads, bridges, and power lines will contribute \nto restoring the supply and distribution networks for basic goods and services. The construction \nof  four  schools  will  help  the  affected  children  regain  access  to  education.  Municipal \ninfrastructure (e.g., on-site roads, power and water supply, and the drainage system) in the \nKurshab-1  and  Dubitel  permanent  resettlement  centers  will  provide  a  sustainable  living \nenvironment for the affected families. The poor living in the remote areas will benefit directly \nfrom the Project because they are most affected by damaged infrastructure and disrupted social \nservices.  \n \n41.  While in principle ADB's safeguard policies apply to emergency projects, the urgency of \nthis  Project  requires  fast-track  processing,  and  therefore  justifies  procedural  and  timing \nflexibility. An initial social assessment was conducted for all project components. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is provided in Appendix 8. \n \n42.  The Project does not require land acquisition or resettlement because components \ninvolve  rehabilitating  infrastructure  within  existing  rights-of-way  or  building  municipal \ninfrastructure  within  the  new  resettlement  sites  that  are  the  State  property.  Some  106 \nhouseholds in the villages of Kara-Taryk, Dubitel, and Changet  in Osh, whose houses were \ndestroyed, are living in locations that the Government considers at high risk of future floods and \nlandslides. The Government has allocated 23 hectares of land for the Kurshab-1 and Dubitel \npermanent resettlement centers in the same Uzgen district for voluntary resettlement of these \naffected families (see footnotes 10 and 11). The Government has also provided grants or long-\nterm, interest-free loans to help them rebuild houses at the resettlement sites. The Project will \nprovide  municipal  infrastructure  in  these  two  sites.  The  fact-finding  mission\u2019s  preliminary \nassessment shows that relocation to these two centers is voluntary, and that both project \nbeneficiaries and host communities at the two sites are Kyrgyz. While there were no agricultural \nactivities previously undertaken at the site of the Dubitel Permanent Resettlement Center, about \n ", "12  \n1.85 hectares at the Kurshab-1 Permanent Resettlement Center had once been agricultural \nland.  The  Government  has  paid  a  total  of  Som18,492  (about  $440)  to  the  affected  host \ncommunity ($235 per hectare), based on average annual output value. The affected host people \nare generally satisfied with the compensation. Prior to the construction of the ADB-financed \nsubprojects in these two resettlements sites, a domestic consultant will conduct due diligence to \nassess  whether  the  affected  host  people  were  adequately  compensated  and  the  families \nalready relocated did so on a voluntary basis. The consultant will also assist MEES to prepare a \nresettlement framework in compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies, and implement \nmitigation  measures  as  required.  ADB  will  monitor  resettlement  and  implementation  of \nmitigation measures during review missions. ADB\u2019s involvement in the permanent resettlement \ncenters will improve the Government\u2019s resettlement process.  \n \n43.  A summary initial environmental examination (SIEE) was undertaken and is provided in \nAppendix 9. The Government agreed to give due attention to environment aspects of the \nProject, and will request MEES, MOTC, and other agencies concerned to undertake initial \nenvironmental  examinations  (IEE)  for  all  subprojects  according  to  ADB\u2019s  environmental \nguidelines and the Government\u2019s environmental standards and regulations. These agencies will \nalso be required to follow mitigation measures outlined in the IEEs and SIEE during project \nimplementation.  ADB  will  monitor  the  implementation  status  of  mitigation  measures  and \nenvironmental impacts of the Project through regular review missions as well as environmental \nstatus reports the Government will submit twice a year. \n \nC.  Risks \n44.  The Project involves four risks. First, there might be implementation delays because of \nMEES\u2019  limited  capacity.  Project  consultants  will  assist  MEES  in  managing  project \nimplementation. The proposed use of an existing PIU in MOTC will reduce the burden of MEES \nand mitigate this risk. Advance action on procurement, retroactive financing, and adoption of \nlocal competitive bidding and direct purchase will help reduce the risk of delayed procurement. \nSecond,  construction  supervision  may  be  inadequate  because  the  Project  covers  several \nsectors and relatively small subprojects over a widespread area. This risk would be mitigated \nthrough adequate consulting services. Third, counterpart funds may not be provided in a timely \nmanner.  ADB  will  work  closely  with  the  Government  to  ensure  that  sufficient  counterpart \nresources required for the Project are provided on a timely basis. ADB financing for part of the \nlocal currency cost would alleviate this risk. Fourth, fresh landslides and floods may damage \ncompleted project works. This risk would be mitigated through careful project design or new \nalignments to avoid areas at high risk of future landslides and floods. During implementation, \nADB will coordinate with the World Bank and other donors, which will help the Government \ndevelop disaster prevention measures. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n45.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has agreed to include the \nfollowing assurances in the loan agreement: \n \n1.  Financial Matters \n \n46.  The Government will ensure that all funds and resources necessary for the Project are \nprovided on a timely basis. \n ", "  13\n2.  Environment and Resettlement \n \n47.  The Government will ensure that MEES prepares IEEs for project components relating \nto schools and municipal infrastructure; and that MOTC prepares IEEs for project components \nrelating to roads, bridges, and electricity, according to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, existing \nlaws, and government regulations and standards concerning environmental protection. \n \n48.  The Government will ensure that (i) the Project is carried out, and all project facilities are \noperated and maintained, according to ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines, the IEEs, the SIEE, \nexisting laws, and government regulations and standards concerning environmental protection; \n(ii) all environmental mitigation measures identified in the IEEs and SIEE are undertaken during \nimplementation; (iii) the guidelines developed under the IEEs and SIEE are incorporated into the \ndesign, rehabilitation, and operation of project facilities; and (iv) MEES prepares and submits to \nADB,  on  a  semi-annual  basis,  an  environmental  status  report  acceptable  to  ADB.  \nThe Government will also ensure that all necessary environmental approvals and clearances, as \nrequired under the relevant laws and government regulations, are obtained in a timely manner. \n \n49.  For the persons who have been relocated to the Kurshab-1 and Dubitel permanent \nresettlement  centers  and  those  who  lost  agricultural  land  because  these  centers  were \nestablished (affected persons), the Government will prepare, through an independent third-\nparty, a due diligence report assessing (i) the adequacy of the compensation and rehabilitation \nmeasures provided to such affected persons, (ii) whether affected persons are at least as well \noff as they would have been in the absence of the relocation, and (iii) whether they have been \nrelocated on a voluntary basis. If necessary, the Government will also (i) prepare a set of \nmitigation measures to address inadequacies found during the due diligence assessment, and \n(ii) implement the mitigation measures according to their terms. The due diligence report and \nmitigation measures, if applicable, will be conducted and determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nPolicy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement.16 The due diligence report \nshould be submitted to ADB for review. \n \n50.  For  the  persons  who  will  be  relocated  to  the  Kurshab-1  and  Dubitel  permanent \nresettlement centers during the Project, the Government will prepare a resettlement framework \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  Handbook  on  Resettlement.  \nThe resettlement framework will contain guidelines and measures for assessing whether (i) the \nProject will cause impacts from land acquisition and/or resettlement, and (ii) the relocation to the \npermanent resettlement centers will be done on a voluntary basis. It will also include procedures \nfor independent third-party verification. If information obtained under the resettlement framework \nshows impacts from land acquisition and resettlement, the Government must inform ADB and \nexplain the reasons. After concurrence from ADB, the Government will prepare a resettlement \nplan according to ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement. \nThe resettlement plan must be approved by ADB prior to the implementation of any resettlement \nactivities under the Project. \n \n3.  Operation and Maintenance of Project Facilities \n \n51.  The Government will ensure that (i) project facilities other than water supply facilities are \nmaintained according to sound administrative policies and practices by project oblasts, or the \nimplementing agencies through the concerned departments and utility companies in charge; \nand (ii) the water supply facilities constructed in the Dubitel permanent resettlement center are \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 1995.

Introduction  \n \n1.  The  Ministry  of  Ecology  and  Emergency  Situations  (MEES)  is  conducting  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEE) for the components of the Project relating to schools and \nmunicipal  infrastructure  and  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and  Communications  (MOTC)  is \nconducting  IEEs  for  the  project  components  relating  to  roads,  bridges,  and  power  lines.  \nThis document is a summary IEE (SIEE) based on the findings of an Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) fact-finding mission in September 2003. The mission visited proposed project sites and \nheld discussions with the central and local governments, as well as representatives of affected \ncommunities. ADB has classified the Project under environmental category B. The mission \nprepared this SIEE for the Project with inputs from MEES, the ADB resident mission in the \nKyrgyz  Republic,  and  domestic  consultants.  MEES  will  conduct  further  environmental \nassessment according to government regulations and ADB\u2019s requirements during processing \nand implementation. \n \nB.  Description of the Project \n \n2.  The Project will rehabilitate and reconstruct public infrastructure damaged by severe \nlandslides and floods during the spring and summer of 2003. The project comprises four \ncomponents covering four oblasts (provinces):  \n \n(i)  Roads  and  Bridges.  Rehabilitating  five  damaged  roads  and  rebuilding  ten \ndamaged bridges in Chui, Issyk-kul, Jalal-Abad, and Osh; \n(ii)  Power  Lines.  Rehabilitating  four  damaged  distribution  lines  totaling  \n21 kilometers, and replacing three transformer stations in Chui and Osh;  \n(iii)  Schools. Building four schools in Chui and Osh; and   \n(iv)  Municipal  Infrastructure.  Constructing  on-site  roads,  power  supply,  water \nsupply, and drainage systems in two resettlement centers in Osh. \n \n3.  The total project cost is estimated at $6.3 million equivalent, $5 million equivalent of \nwhich will be financed by an ADB loan. The Project will be implemented over 3 years, with \ncompletion scheduled for March 2007. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n4.  The Kyrgyz Republic is extremely mountainous and contains some of the highest parts \nof the Tien Shan and Pamir Alay ranges. Its average elevation is approximately 2,750 meters, \nranging from 500 meters in the Fergana Valley to 7,439 meters at Pobeda Peak. The mountains \ncover some 90% of the territory, with the forest cover representing only 4.25% of land area.  \nThe climate is classified as continental, varying with elevation, and can be subdivided into dry \nsteppe, temperate steppe, and tundra. Temperature varies with elevation, with summer highs of \n40oC and winter lows below  \u201320oC. Precipitation also varies with elevation, with more than \n1,000 millimeters (mm) per year in the mountains and less than 230 mm per year in some \nvalleys. Floods and landslides are major concerns because of seismic activity, steep slopes, \nfragile  soils,  and  human  activity.  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  is  unique  in  Central  Asia  for  its \nconcentration of wild plant and animal species. There are more than 500 species of vertebrates, \nincluding 83 species of mammals, 368 species of birds, 28 species of reptiles, 3 spices of \namphibians, 75 species of fish, 3,000 species of insects, and more than 4,500 species of \nsupreme  plants.  The  population  is  5  million  people,  65%  of  whom  reside  in  rural  areas. \n ", "30  Appendix 9 \nAgriculture accounts for more than 50% of gross domestic product and rural inhabitants form \nthe majority of the poor. \n \nD.  Forecasted Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n5.  Project activities will generally occur in sites where infrastructure has been present for at \nleast several years. Potentially sensitive activities include (i) noise and dust from construction at \nthe Kurshab-1 site in Uzgen district of Osh oblast, (ii) lowering of groundwater levels because of \nnew drains constructed at the Kurshab-1 site, and (iii) clearing and re-grading of about 1.5 km of \nthe Nature Park Ala-Archa road in Alamudin district of Chui oblast. There are no known objects \nof historical or cultural heritage that will be impacted by the Project. \n \n6.  Impacts will arise from construction; primarily noise, dust, and waste. Earth-moving may \nalso  induce  erosion  and  landslides.  Some  reconstruction  waste  is  suitable  for  recycling \n(aluminum, copper, and steel). Other wastes (electric insulators and oils) will require careful \nhandling, engineered treatment, and disposal. Other debris (e.g. from clearing demolished \nbuildings) will be disposed as engineered fill or municipal solid waste in designated areas.  \n \n7.  Potential impacts can be mitigated with good design and best engineering practices for \nnoise abatement as well as dust and erosion control. Mitigation measures include (i) rock \ngabions, riprap, and stabilizing vegetation to minimize erosion; (ii) storm water retention basins \nto control contaminated run-off, if necessary; (iii) restriction of working hours to minimize noise \ndisturbance; (iv) water spray to suppress dust at construction sites; (v) re-grading to return \nconstruction sites to natural contours, or engineered contours to minimize erosion and landslide \npotential; (vi) re-grading and revegetation of borrow pits; and (vii) designation of engineered \ndisposal sites for waste that cannot be reused or recycled.   \n \n8.  The Uzgen-Zerger power lines will be reconstructed along the existing right-of-way to \nminimize disturbance to nearby residents. A small patch of water-logged ground at Uzgen-\nZerger does not carry any ecological value or require protection. \n \n9.  Lowering  of  groundwater  at  the  Kurshab-1 Permanent Resettlement Center will be \nnecessary for foundation stabilization, and will not have any long-term negative impacts on \nwater quality or supply. Water supplies for schools and settlements will meet Kyrgyz water \nquality standards (or World Health Organization standards); MEES will determine if treatment \nsystems are necessary.  \n \n10.  The alignment of the Nature Park Ala-Archa road will be maintained after rehabilitation, \nas this is the only main access route for visitors. A new alignment bypassing the park is \nimpractical considering the need to provide continued access to the park. The current alignment \nalong the riverbed represents the most effective solution.  \n \n11.  The Project does not require resettlement. 106 households in the villages of Kara-Taryk, \nDubitel, and Changet of Osh oblast, whose houses were destroyed, are living in areas the \nGovernment considers at high risk of future floods and landslides. Accordingly, the Government \nhas allocated 23 hectares of land for the Kurshab-1 and the Dubitel resettlement centers in the \nsame district. The fact-finding mission\u2019s preliminary assessment shows that resettlement is \nvoluntary, and that project beneficiaries and host communities in the resettlement sites are \nKyrgyz. About 1.85 hectares of land in the Kurshab- 1 Permanent Resettlement Center had \nonce been agricultural land, and the Government has paid a total of Som18,492 (about $440) to \nthe affected host community ($235 per hectare), based on average annual output value.The \n ", "  Appendix 9  31 \naffected host people are generally satisfied with the compensation. Prior to the construction of \nthe ADB-financed subprojects at those resettlement sites, due diligence will be conducted and a \nresettlement framework developed according to ADB\u2019s social safeguard policies. A domestic \nconsultant will assist MEES with community consultation, participation, social impact and benefit \nmonitoring,  preparation  of  the  resettlement  framework,  and  implementation  of  mitigation \nmeasures as required. ADB\u2019s involvement in the permanent resettlement centers will improve \nthe Government\u2019s resettlement process. \n \nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n12.  MEES will be the executing agency. MEES and MOTC will be implementing agencies. \nAs the executing agency, MEES will ensure that an environmental assessment and relevant \nprocedures are incorporated at each stage of the work, specifically (i)  preparation of tender \ndocuments and contracts, (ii) bid reviews and awards, (iii) supervision of pre-construction \nbaseline monitoring, and (iv) construction supervision. \n \n13.  MEES  will  also  be  responsible  for  ensuring  that  the  following  laws  of  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic are complied with: \n \n(i)  Law on Environmental Protection, \n(ii)  Law on Environmental Expertise (Environmental Assessment), \n(iii)  Law on Specially Protected Nature Territories, \n(iv)  Law on Animal World, \n(v)  Law on Atmosphere Protection, \n(vi)  Forest Code, \n(vii)  Law on Highways, and \n(viii)  Law on Protection and Usage of Historical and Cultural Heritage. \n \n14.  Staff from MEES, MOTC, and other relevant government agencies should regularly \nundertake joint environmental inspection of project activities, especially dust, erosion, and noise \ncontrol. The results of the inspections should be included in bi-annual reports submitted by \nMEES to ADB. An environment/social officer should be assigned to each rehabilitation package \nto ensure that environmental contract provisions are enforced. \n \n15.  Recommended environmental monitoring includes routine site inspection and reporting \non soil and erosion control, embankment and erosion protection, borrow pit restoration, water \nquality monitoring (including baseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring), routine dust \nand  noise  monitoring,  and  direct  supervision  and  documentation  of  waste  disposal. \nEnvironmental conditions will be monitored at least twice per year and results reported to ADB. \n \n16.  Specific environmental provisions related to the following topics should be included in \nthe project contract documents as necessary: \n \n(i)  embankments and erosion prevention measures; \n(ii)  borrow pit restoration; \n(iii)  quarry activities; \n(iv)  siting of construction camps and related facilities; \n(v)  siting of asphalt plants; \n(vi)  baseline and routine periodic air quality monitoring; \n(vii)  open burning is prohibited; use of solvents and volatile materials will be approved \nby the project\u2019s construction supervision consultants; \n ", "32  Appendix 9 \n(viii)  dust-generating  items  will  be  conveyed  under  cover;  road  surfaces  and \nexcavation and construction sites will be sprayed with water to control dust; \n(ix)  trucks carrying earth, sand, or stone will be covered with tarps to avoid spilling; \n(x)  baseline and routine periodic water quality monitoring; \n(xi)  baseline and routine periodic noise monitoring; \n(xii)  other noise-related provisions, such as source controls, time-of-day restrictions, \ntime and activity constraints, and community awareness activities; \n(xiii)  safety  provisions  such  as  detours  and  traffic  interruptions,  and  emergency \nresponse procedures in the event of accidents or natural disasters; and \n(xiv)  community relations. \n \n17.  Additional recommendations for oversight and monitoring include: \n \n(i)  Design of all rehabilitation works will be followed, and any deviations that occur \nshould consider the associated potential environmental impacts. \n(ii)  The  designs  will  make  full  provision  for  incorporating  the  various  mitigation \nmeasures noted above. \n(iii)  Contract documents will include, but will not be limited to, all the appropriate \nclauses to cover the environmental protection requirements. \n(iv)  Loan  covenants  should  include  provision  for  adequate  maintenance  of  the \nrehabilitated facilities. \n(v)  Critical activities with anticipated environmental impacts during construction and \noperation should be closely monitored. \n \nF.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n18.  MEES, MOTC, and consultants will document public consultation and disclosure before \nand during implementation. Because this is an  emergency project, consultation with local \nauthorities and residents was conducted on an ad-hoc basis during the fact-finding mission. \n \nG.  Findings and Recommendations \n \n19.  The Project will rehabilitate roads, bridges, power lines, and schools. Adverse impacts \non the environment will be small and limited to the construction period. The most important \nmeasures are proper disposal of construction debris and waste. Adverse impacts can be easily \nmitigated through good engineering and construction practices. No negative impact will persist \nduring  operation.  The  Project  requires  no  resettlement.  Since  all  identified  adverse \nenvironmental impacts are minor and can be mitigated, an environmental impact assessment is \nnot required. \n \nH.  Conclusions \n \n20.  The Project will have no direct negative impacts on water supply, sewerage, energy \nsystems, or waste disposal. No impacts on archaeological or historic resources are expected; \nno significant adverse impacts on settlement patterns, provinces, or communities; and no \nsignificant adverse impacts to aquatic or terrestrial ecosystems are anticipated. Little or no \nagricultural displacement will occur. Construction materials\u2014except special ones such as cable \nstrands  and  admixtures\u2014will  be  obtained  in  and  near  project  areas.  Embankment  soil, \naggregates, and cement sources are available in or near project sites. No adverse impacts are \nseen on employment and income trends, nor on ethnic minorities. \n "], "metadata": {"Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 5.0.5 (Windows)", "Author": "aj3", "ModDate": "D:20031212110554+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20031125190713+08'00'", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 5.0 for Word"}}
