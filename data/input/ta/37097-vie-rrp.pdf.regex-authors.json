This  limits  access  to  markets, \ninputs (including irrigation water), and public services (such as \neducation  and  health  services),  and  increases  vulnerability  to \ndisasters.  It  also  reduces  the  impact  of  public  and  private \ninvestment made in other sectors (such as agriculture, health, and \neducation) that depend upon effective rural infrastructure. In the \nproject  area,  only  30%  of  provincial  roads  have  all-weather \nsurfaces; this severely limits communications in rural areas and \nincreases  travel  times  and  transport  costs  for  agricultural \nenterprises. Irrigation systems have deteriorated over time and \nare not able to deliver the water needed to achieve full coverage \nof service areas. Fifty percent of rural households do not have \naccess to clean water supplies, and defective or deficient coastal \ninfrastructure can not prevent the intrusion of seawater into crop \nlands  and  domestic  water  supplies,  resulting  in  reduced  crop \nyields and an increase in the cost of drinking water. \n ", "ii \nPast experience of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other \ndonors  in  rural  infrastructure  improvement  in  the  face  of \nchallenges  similar  to  those  in  Viet  Nam  have  generally  been \nfavorable. All completed ADB projects in the sector have been \nassessed as successful and all were able to achieve a wider \nimpact than intended in the original scope. Independent studies \nhave  demonstrated  significant  impact  from  infrastructure \ninvestments of all types. The improvement in rural infrastructure in \nViet Nam over the past decade is considered to be one of the \nreasons  for  the  significant  growth  achieved  in  the  agriculture \nsector and the concomitant decline in poverty. \n \nFurther investment in rural infrastructure, especially in the rural \nareas of the Central Region where poverty levels remain high, is \ntherefore  seen  as  a  key  to  removing  the  constraints  on  the \nproductivity in the project area and hence contributing both to \nreducing poverty and diminishing the likelihood that people who \nhave recently escaped the poverty trap will fall back into it. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The overall impact of the Project is expected to enhance rural \nlivelihood  opportunities  and  standard  of  living  for  the  rural \npopulation residing in the Central Region of Viet Nam. This is to \nbe achieved through improved quality, great coverage and better \nintegration  of  rural  infrastructure.  Increased  agricultural \nproductivity,  wider  employment  opportunities,  improved  health \nand education levels, and reduced exposure to natural disasters \nwill collectively improve standards of living for the rural population. \n \nProject Investment Plan  The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $168.2 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $13.1 million. \n \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of SDR 58,723,000 from \nthe Asian Development Fund to help finance the Project. The loan \nwill have a 32-year maturity including a grace period of 8 years, a \n1% interest charge during the grace period and 1.5% during the \namortization period. The Project will be jointly cofinanced with a \nloan  by  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  in  the \namount of \u20ac40 million ($52.0 million equivalent). AFD will also \nprovide cofinancing on a grant basis in the amount of \u20ac1.0 million \n($1.3 million equivalent). The proceeds of the loans and the grant \nwill  be  passed  as  a  grant  to  the  13  participating  provincial \ngovernments by the national Government. The balance of the \nproject cost ($24.8 million equivalent) amounting to 15% will be \nfunded  by  the  Government  and  participating  provincial \ngovernments from provincial budgets. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2014 \n \nEstimated Project  31 December 2013 \nCompletion Date   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) ", "iii \n \n \nImplementation  In  keeping  with  the  principles  of  decentralization  and  the \nArrangements  devolution of responsibilities, the implementing agencies (IAs) for \ninfrastructure  subprojects  will  be  the  respective  provincial \npeoples\u2019 committees (PPCs) of the 13 participating provinces. A \nCentral Project Management Unit (CPMU) established within the \nAgriculture  Project  Management  Board  of  MARD,  will  be \nresponsible for project implementation at the national level. At \nprovincial level, day-to-day management will be the responsibility \nof provincial project management units (PPMUs) established by \nPPCs of participating provinces within the provincial Department \nof  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD).  A  two-stage \nprocess for the identification and preparation of subprojects will \nbe adopted. Firstly, subproject proposals will be selected by PPCs \nfrom  priority  investments  within  provincial  socio-economic \ndevelopment plans (SEDPs). Subprojects chosen should support \nsector  objectives  mainly  comprising  rural  roads,  irrigation \n(including  drainage  and  flood  control),  domestic  water  supply, \nmarkets, and coastal infrastructure with an estimated cost ranging \nfrom $0.5 million to $4 million. These will be confirmed through a \nprocess  of  public  consultation  with  potential  beneficiaries  and \nother  stakeholders,  after  which  a  subproject  identification \nproposal (SIP) will be prepared by the PPMU, submitted to the \nCPMU and, if over $2 million, submitted to ADB for concurrence. \nThe  second  stage  involves  the  preparation  of  a  subproject \ninvestment report (SIR). Upon completion of the SIR, first the PPC \nand then the CPMU will review the studies to ensure that they \nmeet the eligibility criteria for implementation financing and any \nother internal requirements that may be imposed by the province \nor the national Government. The first SIP of less than $2 million \nfrom the provinces covered earlier under the Rural Infrastructure \nSector Project (RISP), and the first SIP under $2 million from \nother  provinces  which  do  not  have  prior  experience  of \nimplementing  the  RISP,  will  also  be  submitted  to  ADB  for \napproval. The PPMUs will then be responsible for supervising \ndetailed design and construction of the approved subprojects. \n \nProcurement  Procurement  will  be  undertaken  by  the  CPMU  and  PPMUs. \nGoods  and  works  financed  by  ADB  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts for works valued at over \n$2  million  equivalent  shall  be  procured  through  international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB), in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines. The first five SIPs prepared shall be submitted to ADB \nfor approval on a no-objection basis. Smaller packages for works \nvalued  at  less  than  $2  million  or  equivalent  but  more  than \n$100,000  or  equivalent  shall  be  procured  through  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB using a \none-stage,  two-envelope  system.  For  works  below  $100,000 \nequivalent,  shopping  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  may  be \n ", "iv \nused. Contracts for goods valued at over $500,000 equivalent \nshall  be  procured  through  ICB  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement  Guidelines.  Goods  costing  less  than  $500,000 \nequivalent  but  more  than  $100,000  shall  be  procured  through \nNCB  procedures  using  a  one-stage,  two-envelope  system \nacceptable to ADB. Smaller packages for goods valued at less \nthan $100,000 may be procured through shopping procedures \nacceptable to ADB. \n \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  three  types  of  consulting  services: \n(i) international  and  national  consulting  services  to  assist  the \nCPMU with implementation and training; (ii) national consultants \nto  assist  PPMUs  with  the  preparation  of  environmental, \nresettlement, and social safeguards for SIPs and SIRs (including \nassociated environmental assessments and resettlement plans); \nand  (iii)  national  engineering  consultants  to  prepare  detailed \nengineering  designs  and  supervise  construction  of  works.  To \nsupport  implementation  and  capacity-building  initiatives,  the \nProject  will  fund  a  total  of  60  person-months  of  international \nspecialists and 271 person-months of national specialists for a \ntotal  of  331  person-months.  Consultants  will  be  selected  and \nengaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and AFD\u2019s \nprocurement regulations. The CPMU will be responsible for the \nrecruitment of project implementation consultants through a firm \nusing  quality  and  cost  based  selection.  National  consultants \nfacilitating  community  participation  and  providing  advice  on \nsafeguards to the provincial governments will be recruited by the \nCPMU  from  national  firms  using  the  consultants\u2019  qualification \nselection (CQS). PPMUs will be responsible for recruiting national \nconsultants  to  provide  technical  specialists  for  design  and \nsupervision of works using CQS procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \nProject Benefits and  The intended beneficiaries are productive members of the rural \nBeneficiaries  population in areas impacted by subprojects. They are mainly \nfarmers and their families who are poor or live just above the \npoverty  line,  whose  incomes  and  livelihoods  are  currently \nimpaired  by  the  lack  of  access  to  markets,  employment \nopportunities, and services. Other groups of beneficiaries include \n(i)  road  users,  (ii)  general  goods  and  service  providers,  (iii) \nsuppliers  of  agricultural  products  and  services,  (iv)  people \nengaged  in  marketing,  (v)  agricultural  cooperatives,  (vi)  water \nuser  groups  or  associations,  (vii)  irrigation  management \ncompanies, and (viii) stakeholder agencies. Measures are built \ninto the project design to ensure that women and ethnic minorities \nalso benefit from the Project. \n \nThe Project will produce a range of economic benefits which vary \ndepending on the type of infrastructure identified for rehabilitation. \nRural road investments have been shown to produce a broad \nrange of positive impacts, ranging from immediate benefits such ", "v \nas reduced travel costs and times, to less direct benefits such as \n(i)  a  diversification  of  income  sources,  (ii)  higher  levels  of \nagriculture  production,  (iii)  greater  diversification  of  agriculture \ncrops, (iv) greater access to health and education services, (v) \nreduced  costs  of  inputs  and  household  commodities,  and  (vi) \noverall reduced levels of poverty among communities served by \nthe roads. The primary direct benefit from irrigation subprojects \nwill be increased agricultural production and the diversification \ninto  higher  value  crops.  The  benefits  from  improved  coastal \ninfrastructure are broad and varied but include (i) increased crop \nyields, (ii) safer drinking water due to the prevention of saline \nintrusions,  (iii)  increased  aquaculture  and  salt  production,  (iv) \nreduced  loss  of  farm  land  from  dune  encroachment,  and  (v) \nenhanced fisheries due to mangrove rehabilitation. The benefits \nof improved domestic water supplies include (i) reduced incidence \nof water-borne diseases, and (ii) reduced time and labor spent \nfetching  water  (especially  for  women  and  children),  releasing \nlabor  resources  for  more  productive  economic  activities  or \neducation.  Improved  attention  to  planning  and  prioritization \nprocesses  in  design  and  management  of  rural  infrastructure \ninvestments  should  lead  to  efficient  and  targeted  resource \nallocation. The cumulative net overall economic benefits include \n(i) improved accessibility in rural areas of the Central Region, (ii) \nhigher levels of agriculture and aquaculture production, (iii) lower \ncosts  of  agricultural  inputs  and  consumer  commodities,  (iv) \nenhanced access to markets, (v) responsive investment planning, \nand (vi) a broader range of economic opportunities both within \nand  beyond  the  agricultural  sector.  As  a  consequence,  the \nsignificant  social  impacts  include  (i)  improved  livelihoods,  (ii) \nfewer  poor  communities  in  the  area,  (iii)  higher  levels  of \neducation, and (iv) improved public health. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The  project  design  assumes  that  the  participating  provincial \ngovernments have the capacity and technical skills to identify, \nplan,  design,  and  implement  medium-scale  rural  infrastructure \nrehabilitation  and  upgrading  but  that  they  lack  the  financial \nresources for these purposes. This assumption is proven valid by \nthe  successful  implementation  of  the  predecessor  project,  the \nRISP,  which  was  implemented  to  sound  technical  standards \nwithin  the  designed  implementation  period  and  within  budget. \nImplementing such a project at the provincial level in Viet Nam \ndoes, however, carry certain risks. Not all provincial governments \nare adequately skilled at (i) identifying high-priority and strategic \nsubproject investments, (ii) dealing with environmental or social \nimpact  issues  (except  for  land  acquisition  matters),  or  (iii) \nappreciating the need for full public consultation. Moreover, many \nprovincial governments do not fully appreciate the importance of \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  funding  for  completed  civil \nworks. The project design, through carefully selected eligibility \ncriteria and capacity-building support, incorporates measures to \nensure that these concerns are dealt with and mitigated to the \n ", "vi \nextent necessary and feasible, and assurances have been given \nby the Government that structures built under the Project will be \nfully maintained. The overwhelming direct and indirect benefits \nexpected  from  the  Project  thus  indicate  that  the  impact  will \noutweigh any possible social, environmental, or financial risks the \nProject might face. \n \nTechnical Assistance  The  CPMU  and  PPMUs  will  be  provided  with  an  advisory \ntechnical assistance to (i) provide guidance and assistance at \nboth national and provincial levels for further policy development \nwith a focus on O&M, and (ii) ensure that both Viet Nam\u2019s and \nADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  and  procedures  are  understood  and \nfollowed during project implementation. This technical assistance \nwill be implemented prior to and during project start-up and during \nthe first 2 years of implementation. The main thrust of new policy \nimprovement will be a thorough analysis of O&M arrangements of \ninfrastructure funding by provincial governments. The main thrust \nof the support for policy compliance will be to ensure that project \nmanagement is established on a sound financial and procedural \nbasis  and  that  ADB  and  Government  concerns  regarding \nsafeguards, the prevention of graft and corruption, procurement, \nand community involvement are fully taken into account during \nday-to-day  project  implementation  activities.  The  cost  of  the \ntechnical assistance is estimated at $1.1 million of which $1.0 \nmillion will be funded on a grant basis; the balance will be funded \nby the Government.  \n \n \n ", "103o  00\u2019E 108o  00\u2019E\nPEOPLE'S  REPUBLIC\nSOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF VIET NAM\nOF  CHINA\nHa Giang INTEGRATED RURAL\n9 Cao Bang\n7 DEVELOPMENT SECTOR PROJECT IN\nLao Cai\n1 6 10 THE CENTRAL PROVINCES\nLai Chau 4 Bac Kan\n2 Ye8n Bai Tuye1n1 QuaTnhgai Ngu1y6en Lang Son\nSon La Phu Tho 12Vin1h3 Phuc Bac1 G8iang 17\nDien Bien 5\n3 HA NOI 1419 Ha Long\n20 15 Hai 21\nHoa Binh Duong Hai Phong\n23 24 22\nThai Binh\n25 26 Gulf   of   Tonkin\nNinh Binh\n20 o 00\u2019N 27 20 o 00\u2019N\nThanh Hoa\n28 PROVINCES\n1.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Integrated Rural Development Sector Project \nin the Central Provinces, and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) of a loan and a grant to be provided by Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) for \nthe Project. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Infrastructure \nPolicy  Reform  Support  and  if  the  Board  approves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under  the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  In November 2004 ADB approved a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to \nhelp the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam formulate a project for rural infrastructure improvement \nin the country\u2019s Central Region.1 The Project was to be modeled on the Rural Infrastructure \nSector  Project  (RISP),  approved  in  19972 and  completed  in  2004.3 During  preparation,  a \ndecision was taken to amalgamate the proposed Project with another similar project being \nprepared simultaneously under another PPTA.4 This report is based on findings of the two \nPPTAs,  Government  feasibility  studies,  findings  of  ADB  missions,  and  discussions  with \ngovernment  officials  and  stakeholders.  The  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is \npresented as Appendix 1. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n3.  When ADB resumed operations in Viet Nam in the early 1990s the country was very \nmuch rural based and poverty was a rural phenomenon. In 1993, 80% of the population lived in \nrural areas, and while the national level of poverty was 58.1%, the percentage of rural people \nliving in poverty was 66.4%. Since then Viet Nam has made remarkable progress in poverty \nreduction. The overall poverty level has fallen to 23.2% but the rural population still accounts for \n70% of the country\u2019s population and levels of poverty remain higher in rural areas. In 2004, rural \npoverty levels were estimated at 26.4%5 in contrast to 13.7% in urban areas. \n \n4.  One of the main reasons for the dramatic advances in poverty reduction has been the \nstrong growth of the agriculture sector, which is the mainstay of economic activity for 90% of \nrural households. Despite declining commodity prices and the impact of the Asian economic \ncrisis, agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 4% over the past \ndecade compared with the economy\u2019s annual growth rate of 7%. This has been achieved \nthrough very high production growth rates in spite of depressed rural prices. For example, the \nproduction of rice, the country\u2019s staple crop, grew by 43% between 1995 and 2005.6 The \nincrease in production of other crops has been even more impressive, with maize increasing \nmore than threefold and coffee and rubber production more than fourfold over the same period. \nNot only did agricultural production increase, but there was also deepening of the domestic \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Between 1990 and 2002, vegetable, pork, poultry, and \negg production per capita all doubled. Since the population of the country also increased \nsignificantly during this period, this indicates something like a quadrupling of overall production.7 \n \n5.  Significant reductions in the level of poverty in the rural areas were also achieved \nthrough other means. According to World Bank (WB) studies (footnote 7), 2.5 million people in \nrural areas were provided with improved rural transport infrastructure during the last decade. \nThis  has  resulted  in  greater  access  to  services  and  opportunities  and  has  contributed \nsignificantly to lower rural poverty levels - access to off-farm employment and markets for \nnonfarm products. According to the same studies, only 25% of rural families currently rely solely \non agriculture for their incomes; the remaining 75% earn supplementary incomes from off-farm \nemployment or self-employment. In many areas, this is only possible due to increased access to \nmarkets  and  employment  opportunities  from  enhanced  transport  infrastructure.  Improved \naccess to clean water (a major factor in reducing diseases), and increasing the availability of \nproductive labor, especially among women, has also been impressive. Between 1993 and 2002, \nthe percentage of rural households with access to clean water increased from 18.1 to 39.6%.  \n \n6.  However, much remains to be done. In addition to the 26.4% of the rural population still \nliving below the poverty line, a large part of the population has just emerged from poverty yet \nremains vulnerable to economic shocks that could impact on recent achievements. Declining \nagriculture commodity prices or natural disasters could still push many rural households back \ninto poverty. Such was the case in 2005 when a series of major typhoons resulted in serious \ndamage to crops and infrastructure and a significant decline in paddy production. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  In Viet Nam, poverty (especially rural poverty) currently has a geographic and ethnic \nbias. The highest levels of poverty in the country are the Northwest (51.9%) and the North \nCentral Coast (36.5%) regions, while the highest absolute number of poor people is found in the \nNorth Central Coast Region. Thanh Hoa and Nghe An provinces (both part of the proposed \nproject  area)  have  the  highest  numbers  of  poor  people  in  the  country.  This  geographic \nconcentration of poverty also reflects an ethnic bias. Areas with the highest poverty incidence \nalso have high numbers of ethnic minority peoples, and among ethnic minorities poverty levels \nare still as high as 69.3%8 due, in part, to inaccessibility. Poverty in Viet Nam  is a rural \nphenomenon, focused to a large extent in the more isolated central and northern regions of the \ncountry, disproportionately affecting ethnic minorities. This is especially the case for families \nwith limited land resources and those living in natural-disaster prone areas such as coastal \nzones. In these areas, soils are typically poor, land holdings are small in size, and large areas \nare subject to flooding and seawater intrusion during seasonal storms and typhoons. This \nsituation prevails along much of the north-central coast, but also exists to a lesser extent along \nthe south-central coast.9 Efforts focused on poverty reduction will need to focus on these areas \nand the particular problems poor communities face. \n \n8.  One  of  the  main  causes  of  high  poverty  levels  is  inadequate  rural  and  coastal \ninfrastructure of all types (i.e., in the transport, agriculture, water, and environment subsectors). \nThis manifests itself in several ways, including (i) reduced access to health and education \n                                                 \n7 Source: WB. 2006. Accelerating Viet Nam\u2019s Rural Development. Washington, DC. \n8 Based on 2002 figures. The 2004 figures are not yet available. \n9 Ironically, these same areas tend to suffer from drought during the dry season months. \n ", "3 \nservices,  (ii)  increased  transport  costs  (in  time  and  money),  (iii)  constrained  agricultural \nproductivity, and (iv) increased exposure to both waterborne diseases and natural disasters. \nAnalysis of this situation showed that the rural infrastructure problem was in turn, caused by (i) \na lack of investments in upgrading and maintaining the existing capital stock, (ii) poor levels of \ncoverage, notably missing items of infrastructure, especially medium-scale infrastructure, and \n(iii) inadequate capacity  in planning and prioritizing investments. With the present emphasis on \ndecentralization, there remains an essential need to enhance inter-sector coordination and \nimprove  efficiency  of  existing  entities  responsible  for  managing  rural  infrastructure.  These \nentities include (i) state-owned irrigation management companies, (ii) rural irrigation water-user \nassociations, (iii) rural water supply water-user groups, (iv) market management boards, and (v) \nthe provincial departments of transport and road-user associations tasked to maintain rural \nroads at commune and district level. \n \n9.  The  Government\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy 10  and  its  latest  socio-economic \ndevelopment plan (SEDP)11 both place considerable emphasis on the provision of infrastructure \nat the national level and, more directly, at the province, district, and commune levels through the \nbottom-up  planning  process  in  provincial  development  plans.  As  rural  infrastructure  is \nessentially a service sector, deficiencies in its performance compromise investments made in \nthe directly productive sectors (such as agriculture and education). The ADB country strategy \nand program recognizes this priority and has identified limitations in physical infrastructure as \none of the main hindrances to accelerated, private sector-led and socially inclusive growth. \nWB\u2019s recent rural development review (footnote 7), moreover, specifically mentions the gap \nbetween national level and rural level infrastructure at the medium scale (i.e., at provincial and \ndistrict level). It notes that only 30% of provincial roads, for example, have all-weather surfaces, \nseverely constraining communications in rural areas, increasing travel times, and the cost of \ntransport for agricultural enterprises. A review of the rural infrastructure sector is provided in \nAppendix 2 and Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s past experience in rural infrastructure improvement has been generally favorable. \nSimilar ADB-funded projects undertaken in the past include the Irrigation and Flood Protection \nRehabilitation Project,12 the Red River Delta Water Resources Sector Project,13 and the RISP \n(footnote  2)  The  Forestry  Sector  Project14 also  included  a  significant  component  of  rural \ninfrastructure. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) was the executing \nagency for all four projects. The RISP is the closest in design to the proposed Project, involving \nrural infrastructure of several kinds (rural roads, irrigation, village water supplies, and rural \nmarkets).  The  implementation  of  the  RISP  was  effectively  devolved  to  23  participating \nprovinces. Project completion reports (PCRs) for these projects assessed each as successful, \nall achieving a wider impact than originally intended. In particular, the RISP completed the \nrehabilitation of 1,900 kilometers (km) of rural roads against an appraisal estimate of 1,500 km, \nwhile the irrigation area rehabilitated was 60,000 hectares (ha) against an appraisal estimate of \n20,000 ha. Similar projects funded by other donors include the WB first and second Rural \nTransport Projects that were also assessed as successful.

More recently, donor investment has adopted a program approach with direct budget \nsupport. 15  Previous  ADB-supported  medium  scale  rural  infrastructure  investments, \ncomplementary to Program 135 were coordinated through provincial SEDPs, as would future \ninvestments of a similar scale under Program 135 phase II. \n \n11.  Major lessons learned from these previous investments include (i) that technical capacity \nexists in Viet Nam to undertake such projects, and (ii) that with adequate coordination and \nsupervision; implementation can be successfully devolved to provincial governments. A sector \napproach was also judged to be the most appropriate means of providing investment for a large \nnumber of subprojects located in participating provinces. While significant efforts have been \nmade in previous ADB-funded infrastructure projects for safeguard compliance issues (with \nregard to resettlement and environment), government staff do not always have the expertise to \nadequately deal with these aspects. Other lessons learned from a recent special evaluation \nstudy (SES),16 highlight that investments in rural infrastructure must be contextually appropriate \nto sustainably lift people out of poverty. It also highlights that upgrading isolated roads did not \nlead to a meaningful impact on poverty reduction as these were not integrated with other \neconomic  opportunities.  In  the  case  of  irrigation  and  water  supply  subprojects,  the  SES \nquestioned,  among  other  issues,  the  technical  and  economic  viability  of  small-scale \ninvestments,  and  also  noted  issues  in  operation  and  maintenance.  The  proposed  Project \ntherefore includes considerable support to ensure selection and design of strategically relevant \nsubprojects that have the capacity to genuinely tackle the most binding of economic and social \nconstraints and are not simply standard or inappropriate physical designs. Special focus is \nplaced on addressing O&M-related challenges.   \n \n12.  The project design is based on (i) an identified demand for enhanced medium-scale rural \nand  coastal  infrastructure  to  further  reduce  the  high  poverty  levels  in  the  central  coastal \nprovinces, (ii) the Government and ADB strategies of providing rural infrastructure for this \npurpose, (iii)  the successful design and implementation experience of the RISP and other \nrelated ADB-funded projects, and (iv) the need for future rural infrastructure projects to include \nstronger  measures  to  enhance  both  safeguard  compliance  and  contextual  relevance  in \nsubproject identification and design. Project investments will be complemented by a strong \ncapacity-building and awareness-raising program for provincial level implementation staff. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The project area comprises 13 provinces in the Central Region,17 one of the poorest \nregions of the country and, as such, identified by both ADB and the Government as a region of \nspecial focus for development investment. The most densely populated areas are the coastal \nzones and the alluvial plains. The uplands tend to be sparsely populated by ethnic minority \npeople. While the upland and mountainous areas have extremely high levels of poverty (in \nsome cases over 60%), the greatest absolute numbers of poor people are found in the coastal \nzone and the alluvial plains where there are higher population densities. \n \n                                                 \n15 WB will support the Government\u2019s ongoing rural infrastructure Program 135-II for grassroots rural infrastructure \nalong with policy and institutional amendments. \n16 ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department. 2006.

The economies of all project provinces are dominated by agriculture. The main activity is \nrice cultivation, supplemented in coastal zones by capture fisheries and aquaculture. However, \nsoils tend to be less fertile and sandier than in other parts of the country, while the climate tends \nto be drier, resulting in a high demand for irrigation water to achieve full agricultural potential. \nMoreover, the region is also disaster prone, being subject to typhoons and consequent floods in \nthe  rainy  season  and  droughts  in  the  dry  season.  This  adds  to  the  precarious  economic \nsituation of the population, most of whom live below or just above the poverty line. Rural \ninfrastructure in the project provinces is in particularly poor condition. Approximately 70% of \nprovincial roads are unpaved and impassable during parts of the wet season, while many of the \nirrigation systems require rehabilitation and upgrading. As a result, access to agricultural inputs \n(including water for irrigation) and markets is limited, as is access to public services and clean \nwater supplies. \n \n15.  Facing these constraints, the proposed Project has been designed to (i) improve rural \nlivelihoods  by  increasing  agriculture  productivity,  (ii)  widen  employment  opportunities,  (iii) \nimprove access to health and education, and (iv) reduce exposure to natural disasters. This will \nbe achieved through investments in locally identified, strategically important, medium-scale rural \ninfrastructure  priorities.  Collectively,  investments  made  under  the  Project  will  improve  the \nquality, extend the coverage, and better integrate rural infrastructure in the Central Region. The \nnet effect of this outcome will be to raise the efficiency of investments made in the productive \nsectors and to increase awareness of the need for timely maintenance of rural infrastructure. \nThe types of rural infrastructure to be improved will include (i) rural roads; (ii) irrigation drainage \nand flood control schemes; (iii) rural markets; (iv) rural water supply schemes; and (v) special \ncoastal works such as sand dune stabilization, salinity intrusion prevention, and mangrove \nrehabilitation.  The  proposed  Project  will  finance  locally  determined  priority  infrastructure \ninvestments outlined in provincial SEDPs. Such plans are prepared on a 5-year basis and \nreflect provincial rural development and rural infrastructure priorities, identified on the basis of \ncommunity generated requests from villages, communes, and districts. \n \nB.  Outputs \n16.  The Project has the following three components: (i) rural and coastal infrastructure \ndevelopment, further divided into (a) rural and coastal infrastructure subprojects, and (b) design \nsupport  studies  and  community  participation;  (ii)  capacity  building;  and  (iii)  central  project \nmanagement. Under the rural and coastal infrastructure development component, the Project \nwill provide funds for the design and implementation of priority rural and coastal subprojects \nchosen from the provincial SEDPs. In order to ensure compliance with safeguard requirements \nof the Government and ADB, support will be provided for special design studies relating to \nresettlement,  ethnic  minorities  and  gender,  and  the  environment  for  all  subprojects.  The \ncomponent relating to capacity building provides resources to facilitate training and guidance for \nnational and provincial staff engaged in the Project. Under the project management component, \nfunds will be provided for the coordination and day-to-day management of the Project and the \nprovision of project implementation assistance and capacity-building consultants to assist in the \nimplementation of the Project and training. These are described more fully in Supplementary \nAppendix B. \n \n17.  Being a sector-style project, precise outputs of the proposed Project will be identified \nduring the implementation period from provincial priorities following public consultations. For \nproject design purposes, a series of parameters was developed based on (i) past experience \nunder the RISP, (ii) provincial priorities so far identified, (iii) stakeholder priorities from field \ninterviews, and (iv) the contents of the respective provincial SEDPs. On this basis, it has been \n ", "6 \nassumed that approximately 110 rural infrastructure subprojects, with an average cost of about \n$1.4  million,  will  be  funded  under  the  infrastructure  component.  About  50%  of  subproject \ninvestment is expected to be applied to rural roads, 30% for irrigation and the balance for water \nsupply and sanitation, markets, and specific coastal infrastructure. Given the prevailing unit \ncosts for such works, the envisaged outputs will comprise construction and upgrading of (i)  \napproximately 55 rural roads totaling about 1,000 km, (ii) 20 irrigation, drainage, and flood \ncontrol subprojects impacting on an area of about 30,000 ha, and (iii) approximately 30 further \nrural and coastal infrastructure subprojects (including water supply schemes, rural markets, and \ncoastal  works  such  as  the  upgrading  of  special  infrastructure  for  salt  processing  and \naquaculture,  the  prevention  of  salinity  intrusion,  sand  dune  stabilization,  and  mangrove \nrehabilitation). Four sample subprojects of the type expected under the Project were analyzed \nduring project preparation; each was found to be economically viable with a large number of \nbeneficiaries (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \n18.  The output from the second component will be the training of a significant number of \ngovernment  personnel  in  project  design,  implementation,  and  construction  supervision. \nCapacities  of  national  and  provincial  individuals  associated  with  the  Project  will  also  be \nimproved in the area of safeguards (including environment, resettlement, and social issues). \nActivities to be undertaken will include (i) the training of personnel at the provincial level, \nespecially  on  safeguard  matters,  but  also  in  project  planning,  implementation  supervision, \nmonitoring, and the financial aspects of project management; (ii) the selection of the subprojects \nin consultation with key stakeholders; (iii) the recruitment of design consultants; (iv) subproject \ndesign; (v) contractor recruitment; (vi) the provision of civil works; (vii) the technical aspects of \nO&M required for different road standards and other infrastructure design; (viii) implementation \nmonitoring; and (ix) the development of methods to ensure provision of adequate budget and \ntraining for O&M of completed subprojects. \n \n19.  Outputs from the third component will be the improved capacities of provincial agency \nstaff  to  manage  small-  to  medium-scale  infrastructure  investments  and  to  maintain  these \nfacilities in sound working condition. \n \nC.  Special Features \n20.  The most significant special feature of the Project is the devolution of responsibility for \nimplementation to provincial and district levels in keeping with the Government\u2019s policy on \ndemocracy and devolution as expressed in Decree 79/CP on the Regulation of the Exercise of \nDemocracy  in  Communes  (1998)  (also  known  as  the  Grassroots  Democracy  Decree). \nParticipating provincial governments will be responsible for their respective subprojects and, \nduring implementation, responsibilities will be devolved (to the extent feasible and workable) to \ndistrict level. The extent of commitment and ownership by the provinces to these arrangements \nis evident from the fact that counterpart funding for O&M of completed subprojects will come \nwholly from the provincial government budgets and that the provinces are in full agreement with \nthese arrangements. \n \n21.  The attached advisory technical assistance (ADTA) will provide the opportunity to review \nthe successes and failures in the critical issue of O&M on all types of rural infrastructure \nincluding the more public items such as rural roads, markets, and coastal structures, as well as \nthe more individual items (where the main beneficiaries assume greater responsibility for O&M) \nsuch as water supplies and irrigation rehabilitation. By taking a broad perspective gained from \nreviewing other infrastructure-related projects in cooperation with other donors, there will be a \nunique opportunity to influence government policy on O&M issues. This should lead to (i) a \n ", "7 \nchange  in  attitude  of  those  allocating  budgets  to  improve  sustainability  of  infrastructure \ninvestment, and (ii) improved technical training in the principles of O&M requirements. \n \n22.  In addition, an important aspect in the selection of the subprojects will be their key \nstrategic impact, maximized through rigorous local contextual selection and design processes \n(Appendix 4). For example, rural roads will be selected for upgrading not only because they are \nin poor condition but also because they open up areas where real development potential and \nthe welfare of the productive poor are presently constrained by a lack of access to markets or \ninputs.  Similarly,  irrigation  subprojects  based  on  simple  and  straightforward  repairs  or \nimprovements will be chosen on the basis of their ability to raise crop production across a broad \narea so as to maximize the benefit to a large number of people who may now be only partly \ndependent  upon  agriculture  for  their  livelihoods.  Water  supply  subprojects  for  the  less \nproductive poor areas, for example, will be chosen based on the estimated cost savings in \nareas where potable water is not available or seasonal drought causes severe hardship in \naddition to time and income losses. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n23.  The project investment cost is estimated at $168.2 million, including taxes and duties of \n$13.1 million. A project investment plan is shown in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n24.  The Government has requested a loan of SDR 58,723,000 ($90 million equivalent) from \nthe Asian Development Fund to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 32-year maturity \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, a 1% interest charge during the grace period and 1.5% \nduring the amortization period. Loan joint cofinancing of the Project will be provided by Agence \nFran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) in the amount of \u20ac40 million ($52 million equivalent).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \n53.5 \nAsian Development Bank  90.0 \n52.0  30.9 \nAFD Loan \nAFD Grant  1.3  0.8 \nProvincial Government  24.0  14.3 \nCentral Government  0.8  0.4 \n  Total  168.2  100.0 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AFD = Agence Francais de D\u00e9veloppement. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n25.  Conditions and arrangements for AFD cofinancing will be through a bilateral financing \nagreement  to  be  negotiated  between  the  Government  and  AFD.  AFD  will  also  provide \ncofinancing  on  a  grant  basis  in  the  amount  of  \u20ac1.0  million  ($1.3  million  equivalent).  A \ncofinancing agreement will be entered into by ADB and AFD under which the parties will jointly \nfinance the civil works and international consulting services. The proceeds of the loans will be \npassed to the 13 participating provincial governments by the national Government as a grant. \nThe balance of the project cost ($24.8 million equivalent), amounting to 14.7%, will be funded \nby  the  Government  and  participating  provincial  governments.  Provincial  budgets  of  all \nparticipating  provinces  have  been  examined  and  it  has  been  concluded  that  all  have  the \ncapacity  to  provide  the  needed  counterpart  funding  (Supplementary  Appendix  E).  Land \nacquisition under resettlement plans will not be financed from loan funds but will remain the \nresponsibility of the provinces. The financing plan is shown in Table 2. \n \n26.  To facilitate project implementation, the Board is requested to approve the administration \nof the proposed loan in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac40 million ($52 million \nequivalent) and approve the grant in the amount not exceeding the equivalent of \u20ac1 million ($1.3 \nmillion equivalent), both from AFD, which are expected to be confirmed on or before the date of \nBoard approval. Approval from the cofinancier will be reported to the Board in accordance with \nthe standard reporting procedures. If AFD does not approve the loan and the grant, the AFD \nportions  of  the  loan  and  grant  will  not  be  financed  under  the  Project.  Alternatively,  the \nGovernment may make alternative arrangements, satisfactory to ADB, to cover the funding \nshortfall. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n27.  The executing agency (EA) for the Project will be MARD. The management structure is \nshown in an organization chart in Appendix 6. MARD has implemented a number of ADB \n ", "9 \nprojects including the RISP (the precursor of the proposed Project), and is the EA for a number \nof ongoing projects. Almost all completed projects undertaken by MARD have been rated as \nsuccessful, and while some inefficiency has been reported with ongoing projects, this may be \nattributed more to the complexities of design rather than any fundamental deficiency in MARD\u2019s \ncapacity. In keeping with the principles of decentralization and the devolution of responsibilities, \nidentification and approval of the subprojects will be through the provincial people\u2019s committees \n(PPCs) of the 13 participating provinces. Eight of these provinces participated in the RISP and \nhave had several years experience in the implementation of rural infrastructure subprojects of \nthe type proposed. They are familiar with technical aspects of subproject implementation and \nthe financial aspects of an ADB-financed loan. The other five provinces also have experience \nwith projects funded by ADB and other multilateral agencies including WB and the International \nFund for Agricultural Development. To ensure their full capability in subproject identification, \ndesign, implementation, and financial management, special capacity-building measures will be \nfocused on these provinces during the early stages of implementation. \n \n28.  The CPMU established within the Agriculture Project Management Board (APMB) of \nMARD will be responsible for overall project implementation at the national level. The CPMU will \nbe managed by a national project director and two vice directors supported by appropriate \ntechnical, administrative, and accounting staff. \n \n29.  At the provincial level, day-to-day management will be the responsibility of provincial \nproject management units (PPMUs) established by PPCs of participating provinces within the \nprovincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD). Eight of these PPMUs will \nbe the same as those established and operated under the RISP, while five will be newly \nestablished. As noted, the newly established PPMUs will be given support and training as well \nas assistance from the experienced PPMUs of neighboring provinces. The PPMUs will be \nmanaged by a director, and supported by a full-time coordinator appointed to ensure day-to-day \nsupervision of the PPMU and to coordinate the work of specific technical experts involved in \nsubproject identification, design, and implementation. PPMU staff will be seconded from DARDs \nas well as other departments as per the requirements. An important position of each PPMU will \nbe the safeguards officer appointed to ensure compliance with public consultation requirements, \nenvironmental impact assessment and mitigation, and social impact (including resettlement) \nassessment and mitigation aspects of subproject implementation.  \n \n30.  At the district and commune levels, the Project will liaise closely with the existing local \nadministration.  The  PPMUs  shall  be  responsible  for  ensuring  coordination  of  day  to  day \nactivities at the district and commune level.  This will include organizing public consultations and \nmonitoring of the subproject design and implementation by the subproject beneficiaries.  \n \n31.  To  guide  project  implementation  at  the  provincial  level  and  to  ensure  interagency \ncoordination as required, provincial project steering committees (PSCs) will be established \nwithin participating provinces. The PSCs will be chaired by the vice chairman of the PPC and \nwill comprise members of representatives from the respective PPC departments and local \nagencies.  PSCs will meet regularly on a 6-monthly basis and intermittently as required. \n \n2.  Subproject Preparation and Appraisal \n32.  A two-step process has been selected for the identification and preparation of subproject \nproposals.  During  the  first  step,  subproject  proposals  will  be  selected  by  the  PPCs  from \npriorities  within  their  SEDPs.  Subprojects  chosen  should  be  strategic  and  straightforward \nengineering  projects  and  will  comprise  rural roads,  irrigation  (including  drainage  and  flood \n ", "10 \ncontrol), domestic water supply, markets, and coastal infrastructure, with an estimated cost \nbetween $0.5 million and $4 million. These will then be reviewed through a process of public \nconsultation18 with  potential  beneficiaries  and  other  stakeholders,  after  which  a  subproject \nidentification proposal (SIP) will be prepared by the PPMU. The PPMU will ensure that all of the \nrequired initial screening selection criteria are properly addressed and reported. These will \ninclude the requirements for (i) public consultation, (ii) an initial environmental examination, (iii) \na  preliminary  social  assessment  including  resettlement  and  land  acquisition  impacts,  (iv) \npreliminary  cost  estimation,  (v)  a  preliminary  assessment  of  benefits,  and  (vi)  preliminary \nproposals for O&M. The first two SIPs of less than $2 million\u2014one from an RISP province and \nthe other from a non-RISP province\u2014shall be submitted to ADB for approval (on a no-objection \nbasis). SIPs for subprojects expected to cost more than $2 million will be submitted to ADB for \napproval on a no-objection basis. \n \n33.  The second step in the subproject identification process involves the preparation of a \nfeasibility  study  or  subproject  investment  report  (SIR).  SIRs  will  be  prepared  by  local \nconsultants under the guidance of the PPMU to ensure that subproject eligibility criteria for \nimplementation funding will be met. This includes ensuring that all measures are taken to \nmitigate possible social impacts including special measures for land acquisition, compensation, \nindigenous  people\u2019s  specific  actions  if  required,  and  special  measures  to  improve  the \nparticipation of women and other disadvantaged groups as beneficiaries. Upon completion of \nthe SIR, the PPC will review the studies to ensure that they fully meet the eligibility criteria for \nimplementation financing and any other internal requirements that may be imposed by the \nprovince or the national Government. Upon approval of the SIRs (in the case of subprojects \ncosting less than $2 million) or ADB (in the case of subprojects costing more than $2 million) \nfunds  will  be  committed  for  the  commencement  of  implementation  activities.  The \nimplementation process is described in Appendix 7 and the selection criteria in Appendix 4.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n34.  The proposed Project will be implemented over a period of 6 years from 2008 to the end \nof 2013. Since subprojects will be relatively small and most provinces already have several \nyears  of  experience  in  implementing  similar  subprojects,  and  since  the  responsibility  for \nimplementation will be spread among 13 provinces, preparation work on most subprojects is \nexpected to begin within the first year. Bidding and construction work will then proceed during \nthe second year and will continue into the fourth year. The initial allocation to provinces will be \nbased on a fixed amount to meet PPMU overheads19 plus a proportional amount reflecting the \nrespective size of the rural population of participating provinces. During the fourth year, a \nsecond phase of subprojects will then be taken up with funds not utilized during the first phase. \nThese are expected to be somewhat smaller in size and will be completed by the end of the fifth \nyear or the middle of the sixth year. The second allocation will be made using incentives based \non the implementation performance of the province and the proportional incremental increase in \nprovincial budget allocations for O&M. The final half year of the Project will be spent ensuring \nthat  O&M  arrangements  are  in  place  for  completed  subprojects.  Indicative  allocation  to \nprovinces is presented in Supplementary Appendix F. \n \n                                                 \n18 A consultation framework was agreed with the Government during the Appraisal Mission. \n19 A figure of $6.1 million equivalent per participating province was agreed at appraisal. \n ", "11 \n4.  Procurement \n35.  A procurement capacity assessment of the EA has been conducted and is presented in \nSupplementary Appendix G. This included a review of the CPMU capacity and a review of the \ncapacity of two participating provincial PPMUs. A procurement plan is outlined in Appendix 8 \nwith  indicative  procurement  and  recruitment  contracts  that  were  based  on  the  capacity \nassessment. Pre- and post-review thresholds were discussed and agreed with the CPMU and \nare included in the plan. \n \n36.  Procurement will mainly be undertaken by PPMUs. Goods and works financed by ADB \nand  AFD  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). Contracts for works valued at over $2 million equivalent shall be \nprocured through international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines. Smaller packages for works valued at less than $2 million or equivalent but more \nthan  $100,000  or  equivalent,  shall  be  procured  using  national  competitive  bidding  (NCB) \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  with  a  one-stage,  two-envelope  system.  For  works  below \n$100,000 equivalent, shopping procedures acceptable to ADB may be used. Contracts for \ngoods valued at over $500,000 equivalent shall be procured through ICB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Goods costing less than $500,000 equivalent but more than \n$100,000 shall be procured through NCB procedures using a one-stage, two-envelope system \nacceptable to ADB. Smaller packages for goods valued at less than $100,000 may be procured \nthrough shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n37.  The Project will require three kinds of consulting services: (i) international and national \nconsulting services to assist the CPMU with project implementation, monitoring, and training; \n(ii) national  consultants  to  assist  the  PPMUs  with  the  preparation  of  environmental, \nresettlement, and social safeguards for SIPs and SIRs; and (iii) national engineering consultants \nto prepare detailed engineering designs and supervise construction of works.20 \n \n38.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The CPMU will be responsible for \nrecruiting the project implementation and training consultants21 through a consulting firm. The \nCPMU will also recruit national consultants to facilitate community participation and provide \nadvice on safeguards to provincial governments from national firms using the consultants\u2019 \nqualification selection (CQS). This method will be used since (i) few consultants are qualified, \n(ii) the quality of the firms\u2019 output will be critical to the assessment and mitigation of the Project\u2019s \nenvironmental and social impact; and (iii) recruitment time will be critical.  Individual consultants \nfor capacity building and facilitation are also expected to be recruited by the CPMU. \n \n39.  The PPMUs will be responsible for recruiting national consultants to provide design and \nsupervision services. These consultants will be recruited using CQS procedures acceptable to \nADB because (i) these consultants will be hired under small packages of $200,000 or less, (ii) \nrecruitment time is critical, and (iii) the small size of contracts does not justify the cost of the \npreparation and evaluation of competitive proposals. \n \n                                                 \n20 Since categories (ii) and (iii) will be recruited as needed on a subproject-by-subproject basis as part of the sector \nloan package, it is not currently possible to quantify exactly the required number of person-months of expertise. \n21 To be partly funded by the AFD grant. \n ", "12 \n40.  The  requirement  for  implementation  and  training  consulting  services  and  safeguard \nconsultants is shown in Appendix 9, and outline terms of reference presented in Supplementary \nAppendix H. To support implementation and capacity-building initiatives, the Project will fund a \ntotal  of  60  person-months  of  international  specialists  and  271  person-months  of  national \nspecialists for a total of 331 person-months. Consulting services are necessary for smooth \nimplementation of the Project and to incorporate increased emphasis on safeguards, community \nparticipation, and O&M for subprojects, as well as to continue the capacity-building initiated \nunder the RISP. Consulting services will not only support the CPMU in technical areas of \nengineering  design  and  construction,  but  will  also  be  instrumental  in  introducing  a  more \nconsultative  approach  during  subproject  identification  and  design  to  improve  sustainability. \nInternational expertise is to be provided in (i) project management, (ii) technical engineering, (iii) \ntraining coordination, (iv) safeguard requirements of ADB and the Government, (v) O&M, and \n(vi)  benefit  monitoring.  National  specialists  will  be  required  in  similar  areas  to  facilitate \ntechnology transfer of the training within PPMUs and other target beneficiaries and will include \ncommunity participation specialists, indigenous peoples, and gender specialists, together with \nexperts in the economic assessment of subprojects. \n \n6.  Advance Action and Retroactive Financing \n41.  The  Government  requested  that  ADB  approve  advance  recruitment  action  for \nimplementation and training consultants. Advance action is necessary to ensure consultants are \navailable  to  support  the  early  stages  of  project  implementation.  Retroactive  financing \nwithdrawals from the loan account may be made for reimbursement of eligible expenditures \nincurred under the Project from the date of approval by the ADB Board of Directors to the date \nof effectiveness of the ADB loan, or a maximum of 9 months prior to the date of signing the \nLoan Agreement, whichever is later. The amount of retroactive financing will be subject to a \nmaximum of $2 million equivalent in connection with the following items: (i) recruitment of \nimplementation and training consultants; and (ii) consulting services for project design, including \nenvironmental, social impact, land acquisition, and baseline surveys. The Government was \nadvised that ADB approval of advance contracting action and retroactive financing will not, in \nany way, commit ADB to approve the proposed loan, and that ADB financing will be dependent \nupon compliance with all aspects of ADB procedural requirements, including compliance of the \nGovernment with relevant provisions of the loan and project agreements and ADB guidelines. \n \n7.  Anticorruption Policy \n42.  The Government was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) and the Combating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003) policy. \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB \nreserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, \ncollusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the  Project.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant \nprovisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan and grant regulations and the \nbidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n \n ", "13 \n8.  Disbursement Arrangements \n43.  After  loan  effectiveness,  the  Government  will  establish  two  first-generation  imprest \naccounts (one for ADB and the other for AFD) in a commercial bank in Hanoi acceptable to \nADB. These will be managed by the CPMU under the supervision of the central Treasury. The \nimprest accounts will be managed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). ADB disbursement procedures will be followed for \ndrawing down ADB and AFD loan funds through these two first-generation imprest accounts. \nThe advance to be deposited into each of the imprest accounts will be based on an estimated 6 \nmonths of project expenditure or a maximum of 10% of the respective loan amounts, whichever \nis the lower. Funds in these first-generation imprest accounts will be used to establish advances \nin the second-generation imprest accounts in participating project provinces. These will be \ncontrolled by the PPMUs under the supervision of provincial treasuries. Since a large number of \nsmall payments are expected, most funds for the payment of civil works contracts will be drawn \nfrom  the  provincial  imprest  accounts,  and  these  accounts  will  be  reimbursed  using  the \nstatements of expenditure procedures against progress payments outlined in works construction \ncontracts. Provincial imprest accounts will be replenished upon presentation of documented \nliquidation of expenditures as outlined in ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The CPMU will \nmanage two imprest accounts, one for ADB funds and the other for AFD; similarly, PPMUs will \nmanage two imprest accounts. Disbursement arrangements are presented diagrammatically in \nAppendix 10. \n \n44.  Payments made directly from the CPMU and PPMUs will be supervised and authorized \nby the treasury at central and provincial levels upon receipt of payment documents. Based on \nthe  payments  authorized  by  provincial  treasuries,  each  PPMU  will  prepare  withdrawal \napplications with associated payment documents or statements and the second-generation \nimprest account balance sheet (using the CPMU format) and submit them to the CPMU. Upon \nthe receipt of reimbursement applications and payment documents from PPMUs, the CPMU will \nprepare an aggregated withdrawal application and submit it to the Ministry of Finance for \nendorsement.  Authorized  withdrawal  applications  will  be  forwarded  to  ADB  and  AFD  for \nreimbursement to the respective first-generation imprest accounts. The percentage of each \nclaim  for  reimbursement  will  be  paid  by  the  two  financiers  in  accordance  with  the  loan \nagreements between the Government, ADB, and AFD.  \n \n45.  The effectiveness and efficiency of the disbursement procedures will be assessed at the \nmidterm  review  and  actions  taken  to  simplify  or  streamline  the  processes  if  appropriate. \nStatement of expenditure procedures may be used to reimburse expenditures and liquidate the \nimprest accounts for all individual payments not exceeding $100,000. The imprest accounts will \nbe replenished on a monthly basis to ensure liquidity of funds or when the accounts are drawn \ndown to 20% of the initial deposit. The imprest accounts and statements of expenditure will be \naudited annually by auditors acceptable to ADB. \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  Each PPMU and the CPMU will maintain records and accounts that identify the goods \nand  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  financing  resources  received,  expenditures \nincurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be established and maintained \nin accordance with internationally accepted accounting standards. Annual project accounts of \nPPMUs and the CPMU will be audited by auditors acceptable to ADB. Audit coverage will \ninclude a special audit of project accounts, including separate opinions on (i) the utilization of \n ", "14 \nthe  primary  and  secondary  imprest  accounts;  (ii)  the  statement  of  expenditures,  including \nwhether the amount claimed is duly supported and verified; (iii) whether the CPMU and PPMUs \nare operating the imprest accounts in accordance with ADB procedures; and (iv) compliance \nwith  financial  covenants  specified  in  the  loan  and  project  agreements.  The  audit  reports, \nmanagement letter, and related financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate, or the project closing date if earlier. \nADB informed the Government of its policy on submission of audited accounts, which covers \nfailure of submitting audited accounts and financial statements by  the due date. A formal \nwarning will be issued for accounts more than 6 months overdue, and disbursements will be \nsuspended for accounts that are 6 months overdue. \n \n47.  Each  PPMU  will  provide  monthly  progress  reports  to  the  CPMU.  These  will  be \nconsolidated into quarterly reports and submitted to MARD, PSC, ADB, and AFD. These reports \nwill record (i) the progress made, (ii) problems encountered during the review period, (iii) steps \ntaken or proposed to remedy the problems, (iv) a proposed program of activities, and (v) \nprogress expected for the following quarter. The CPMU will ensure that these reports are \nsubmitted to ADB in a timely manner. \n \n48.  Within 6 months of physical completion of the Project, the CPMU will submit to ADB a \nPCR that describes (i) the physical progress of the Project, (ii) actual costs incurred in relation to \ncost estimates, (iii) the results of capacity-building activities, (iv) the outcome of safeguard \nefforts,  (v)  a  preliminary  assessment  of  achieved  benefits,  and  (vi)  other  relevant  project \nimplementation  matters  requested  by  ADB.  The  financial  management  assessment  of  the \nProject is presented in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n49.  Project progress and performance will be monitored through a comprehensive project \nperformance monitoring system (PPMS). Detailed PPMS parameters and procedures will be \ndeveloped during project implementation. Three different kinds of monitoring will be carried out \nincluding  (i)  implementation  progress  monitoring,  (ii)  safeguard  monitoring,  and  (iii)  benefit \nmonitoring and evaluation. Implementation progress monitoring will be one of the main tasks of \nthe CPMU. The monitoring unit within the CPMU will monitor the progress of activities in each \nprovince  based  on  monthly  PPMU  progress  reports.  Withdrawals,  disbursement,  and \nreimbursement  of  project  accounts  will  also  be  monitored  by  the  same  unit.  Safeguard \nmonitoring  with  associated  grievance  mechanisms  will  be  undertaken  to  ensure  that  the \nrequired policies and procedures and plans for (i) resettlement including land acquisition and \ncompensation,  (ii)  environmental  impact  assessment  and  mitigation,  and  (iii) indigenous \npeoples  specific  actions,  are  implemented  and  achieve  their  expected  outcomes  during \nsubproject preparation, implementation, and operation. In addition, an independent agency will \nbe recruited to specifically monitor the implementation of land acquisition and resettlement \nactivities to ensure full compliance with all laws, decrees, policies, and plans, and to review the \ngrievance  mechanism  for  affected  persons.  Project  benefit  monitoring  activities  will  entail \nperiodic  monitoring  of  the  benefits  and  impacts  of  a  representative  number  of  selected \nsubprojects. This will be undertaken independently by a university, institute, or similar agency \nwith experience in the identification and quantification of economic development benefits. \n \n50.  To assist in financial management and disbursement of loan funds and implementation \nprogress of infrastructure development, specialist inputs will be provided under the consulting \nservices  contract.  In  addition,  participatory  monitoring  of  infrastructure  construction  will  be \n ", "15 \npromoted by the Project to achieve beneficiary commitment to future O&M. Furthermore, each \nSIR will contain a detailed procurement plan that will assist in achieving open and competitive \nbidding for design, construction, and supervision of works contracts and other services as \nrequired. In addition, the procurement plan requires that selection of the main implementation \nconsulting services contract shall be submitted to ADB for prior approval, as will subprojects that \ncost over $2 million.  \n \n11.  Project Review \n51.  Apart  from  regular  reviews,  ADB,  AFD,  and  the  Government  will  undertake  a \ncomprehensive  review  within  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  when  the  first  batch  of \nsubprojects will be in the construction stage. A midterm review will also be undertaken within 36 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. These reviews will include (i) a comprehensive evaluation of \nproject implementation arrangements, (ii) detailed evaluation of the scope and implementation \nprocess and progress of subprojects, (iii) feedback from the PPMS, (iv) the performance of \nconsultants, (v) capacity-building progress, and (vi) the possible reallocation of loan proceeds. \nRemedial action will be instituted as required. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n52.  The policy environment for rural infrastructure in Viet Nam has continued to evolve. With \nemphasis on decentralization, responsibility for allocating resources for O&M expenditures has  \nshifted to the provincial governments. Laws and decrees have been issued  that devolve to local \nadministrations responsibility for rural development and safeguard practices for matters such as \n(i) land acquisition and resettlement, (ii) environmental impact assessment and mitigation, and \n(iii)  community  participation  in  decision  making.  At  the  same  time,  ADB\u2019s  own  policy  and \nsafeguard requirements covering similar issues have also evolved. Financial management and \nprocurement procedures have also developed considerably. All of these new and emerging \nresponsibilities will need to be adopted by provincial governments during subproject preparation \nand implementation, as will the single major policy issue in the sector - that of the need for \nprovincial governments to assign sufficient funding for O&M of completed rural infrastructure \nsubprojects. \n \n53.  Through an ADTA, the CPMU and PPMUs will (i) be provided guidance at both the \nnational and provincial levels for further analyzing policy developments and their application in \nanticipation of future investments in the sector, and (ii) ensure that both Viet Nam and ADB \npolicies and procedures are understood and followed during project implementation. This will be \nimplemented prior to and during project start-up and during the first 2 years of implementation. \nThe main thrust of policy compliance will be a thorough analysis of a range of issues faced by \nprovincial governments for O&M funding. Support for policy compliance will ensure that project \nmanagement is established on a sound financial and procedural basis and that all ADB and \nGovernment  concerns  regarding  safeguards,  the  prevention  of  graft  and  corruption,  and \nprocurement and community involvement, are fully taken into account. The cost of the ADTA is \nestimated at $1.1 million of which $1.0 million will be funded on a grant basis and the balance \nby the Government. Terms of reference and cost estimates for this grant are provided in \nAppendix 11. It will provide 54 person-months of consulting services, comprising 24 person-\nmonths of international and 30 person-months of national expertise. An international consulting \nfirm will provide all the international and national consulting services. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The QCBS \nmethod will be used and the short-listed firms will present simplified technical proposals. \n ", "16 \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Benefits \n54.  Rural road investments have been shown to produce a broad range of positive impacts, \nranging from immediate benefits such as reduced travel costs and times to less direct benefits \nsuch as (i) a diversification of sources of income, (ii) higher levels of agriculture production, (iii) \na greater diversity of agriculture crops, (iv) improved access to health and education services, \n(v) reduced costs of inputs and household commodities, and (vi) overall reduced levels of \npoverty among communities served by the roads. This is confirmed by economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) estimates for sample rural road subprojects of 12\u201319% based on quantifiable \nbenefits (Supplementary Appendix C). One additional potential subproject evaluated in Nghe \nAhn, being robust to variations in commodity price levels as well as levels of utilization, showed \nan EIRR of 16%. The impact on poverty reduction is illustrated by the 50% increase in per \ncapita and household incomes from rehabilitated roads under the RISP. \n \n55.  The direct benefit of irrigation rehabilitation will be increased agriculture production and a \nshift to higher value crops. The sample subproject analyzed shows a change in cropping \npatterns from a single rain-fed rice crop to irrigated sugar cane production, leading to an EIRR \nof 19.9%. The benefits from improved coastal infrastructure are broad and varied but include (i) \nincreased crop yields and safer drinking water due to the prevention of saline intrusions, (ii) \nincreased aquaculture and salt production, (iii) reduced loss of farm land from sand dune \nencroachment, and (iv) enhanced fisheries from mangrove rehabilitation. The benefits from \nimproved domestic water supplies are more difficult to quantify, but include reduced rates of \nwater-borne diseases and reduced time and labor (especially for women and children) used in \nfetching  water,  leading  to  additional  time  for  productive  economic  activities  or  education. \nImproved  capacity  building  in  the  prioritization  of  planning,  design,  implementation,  and \nmanagement of rural infrastructure should lead to more efficient resource allocation and further \nopportunities to increase long-term economic growth and short-term poverty reduction impact. \n \n56.  The  net  overall  economic  benefits  of  the  Project  include  (i)  increased  accessibility \nthroughout the rural areas of the Central Region, (ii) higher levels of agriculture and aquaculture \nproduction, (iii) lower costs of agricultural inputs and consumer commodities, (iv) enhanced \naccess to markets and services, (v) responsive and decentralized investment planning, and (vi) \na broader range of economic opportunities both within and beyond the agricultural sector. An \noverall economic assessment is presented in Appendix 12. \n \nB.  Social Benefits and Impacts \n57.  A summary poverty reduction and social strategy (SPRSS) is presented in Appendix 13. \nAn analysis of the project benefits in the context of the SPRSS indicates that, as a consequence \nof the economic benefits described above, the more significant social impacts will be improved \nlivelihoods and reduced levels of poverty for the population of the project area as a whole, as \nwell as higher levels of education and improved public health. The provision of road access to \nethnic minorities living in isolated mountain areas is likely to have a positive impact, providing \nthem with an outlet for their produce and access to lower priced household commodities as well \nas health and education facilities. The Project is classified category B for indigenous peoples, \nand an ethnic minority development framework (Supplementary Appendix I) has been agreed \nupon in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998). The framework will help extend subproject positive impacts to \n ", "17 \nethnic  minority  groups  and  mitigate  any  negative  impacts.  The  impact  on  women  is  also \nexpected to be positive. Improved road access will open up new opportunities for women who \nlive  in  previously  isolated,  rural  communities.  Not  only  will  they  have  access  to  better \neducational  opportunities  and  health  services,  but  they  will  also  be  able  to  employ \nentrepreneurial skills in developing new income opportunities, particularly in association with the \nupgrading of markets. \n \n58.  Measures have been built into the design to deal with potential negative social impacts. \nTo address the issue of land acquisition and resettlement, a summary resettlement framework \n(Appendix 14) sets out the compensation and other entitlements for any unanticipated land \nacquisition or resettlement impacts in accordance with the Government\u2019s applicable laws and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995). The Project is classified as \ncategory B. The absence of significant resettlement impacts is one of the eligibility criteria for \nsubproject feasibility study funding and category A subprojects will be screened out at the SIR \nstage.22 Short resettlement plans will be prepared for any subproject found to have resettlement \nimpacts to the limit of category B. Compensation (excluding land acquisition), allowances, \noperation and administration costs, surveys, monitoring, and reporting will be financed from loan \nfunds  to  help  ensure  full  and  expeditious  implementation  of  resettlement  plans,  including \ncompensation for any land acquired. Each PPMU will also appoint a safeguards officer. The \nProject also includes such measures as capacity building for PPMU and CPMU staff in social \nsafeguards,  and  arrangements  for  the  independent  monitoring  of  compensation  and \nresettlement during implementation. A representative resettlement plan for the Hung Trung \u2013 \nNghi Kieu subproject is attached as Supplementary Appendix J. A resettlement framework is \npresented in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \nC.  Environmental Impact \n59.  An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was  conducted  based  on  the  review  of \nselected completed subprojects under the RISP and one new representative subproject to \nidentify  potential  impacts,  appropriate  mitigation  measures,  and  monitoring  mechanisms.  It \nconcluded  that  serious  negative  environmental  impact  was  unlikely  since  subprojects  will \nprimarily entail upgradation of small- and medium-scale infrastructure. In general, existing rights \nof way will be used so there will be little land clearing, and structures are generally simple so \nthere will be minimal disturbance. Activities of primary concern during construction will be (i) the \nprovision of filling material from borrow sites and the disposal of excavated material, (ii) the \nimpacts on surface and ground-water quality, (iii) changes to property access, and (iv) traffic \ndisruption.  For  coastal  infrastructure,  care  will  need  to  be  taken  to  avoid  damage  to  key \necological areas such as estuaries and mangroves. In order to ensure a minimum of negative \nenvironmental impacts, subprojects will follow environmental assessment procedures stipulated \nin an environmental assessment and review framework developed to ensure (i) exclusion of \nsubprojects  that  would  cause  significant  adverse  impacts,  and  (ii)  compliance  with  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental regulations and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). A summary IEE \nand environmental assessment review framework are outlined in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nD.  Financial Considerations \n60.  Since most of the investments under the Project will be public sector investments, the \nmain financial issues will concern the ability of the participating provinces to provide counterpart \nfunding from their provincial budgets and the adequacy of O&M funding. While counterpart \n                                                 \n22 Under the RISP, only two out of 183 subprojects funded had significant resettlement impacts. \n ", "18 \nresources are likely to be made available as per the implementation requirements, provinces \nare  expected  to  face  difficulties  in  allocating  appropriate  resources  for  O&M  expenditures \n(Supplementary Appendix E). Provincial budgets for the O&M of public works are chronically \nunderfunded and there is a likelihood that the same situation will prevail for works carried out \nunder the Project. This is a systemic problem that cannot be resolved through one single project \nbut the Project itself can be used to raise policy issues relevant to O&M.  \n \nE.  Assumptions and Risks \n61.  The project design assumes that the participating provincial governments broadly have \nthe capacity and technical skills to identify, plan, design, and implement medium-scale rural \ninfrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading works but that they do not have sufficient budget to \nmeet the infrastructure rehabilitation and upgrading needs that they face.  \n \n62.  Implementation of such a project at the provincial level does, however, face certain risks, \nincluding the following: (i) not all provincial governments are adequately skilled at identifying \nhigh-priority and strategic subproject investments; (ii) not all provincial government staff are fully \nfamiliar with environmental or social impact issues (other than land acquisition matters); (iii) not \nall provincial, district, and commune staff fully understand the need for public consultation \nbefore and during subproject identification, design, and implementation; and (iv) many provincial \ngovernments do not place due emphasis on O&M funding for completed civil works. Through \nthe carefully formulated subproject investment eligibility criteria and the scale and scope of its \ncapacity-building support, the project design has incorporated a series of measures to ensure \nthat (i) project staff have the technical capacity to properly assess subproject proposals, (ii) \nenvironmental and social safeguard issues are fully taken into account, (iii) the public in general \nand beneficiaries in particular are fully consulted about proposed works, and (iv) sufficient \nunderstanding and awareness is created to ensure that O&M funds are made available after \nsubproject  completion  to  sustain  economic  benefits  from  investments  made  in  rural \ninfrastructure.  The  capacity-building  initiatives  incorporated  into  the  design  represent  a \nsignificant attempt to address the sector policy development agenda. In view of the specialist \nconsulting services support under the associated ADTA, the risk associated with inadequate \nattention to O&M is therefore minimized. \n \nF.  Overall Assessment \n63.  An analysis of sample subprojects examined during project preparation has shown that \neconomic returns will be satisfactory and the number of beneficiaries substantial. Moreover, \nthese analyses indicate that social and environmental costs will be minor or negligible. In \naddition,  measures  have  been  built  into  the  Project  to  ensure  that  negative  social  and \nenvironmental  impacts  are  kept  to  a  minimum.  The  most  serious  risk  is  that  of  potential \ndeficiencies in O&M funding. To the extent possible, measures have been taken to minimize \nthis risk, and assurances have been given by the Government that structures built under the \nProject will be maintained in fully operational condition. The overwhelming direct and indirect \nbenefits expected from the Project thus indicate that the Project\u2019s impact will far outweigh any \npossible social, environmental, or financial risks the Project might face. \n \n ", "19 \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n64.  The following project-specific assurances were confirmed by the Government in addition \nto the standard ADB assurances to ensure the smooth implementation of the Project. \n(i)  The subprojects to be financed under the Project will have been screened and \nselected in accordance with the criteria agreed between the Borrower and ADB, \nas outlined in Appendix 4. \n(ii)  Only subprojects where the impacts from resettlement are within the limits of \nADB\u2019s resettlement category B rating will be permitted under the Project. MARD \nwill ensure that civil works contractors are not issued a notice of possession of \nsite for construction work for any specific section of infrastructure unless, for that \nsection, MARD/PPMUs have, in accordance with the approved resettlement plan, \nprovided compensation payments and relocation to new sites (where relevant) as \nconfirmed by an independent monitoring agency. \n(iii)  Approval of IEEs by the relevant local agency will be a precondition for the \ncommencement of civil works for each subproject. \n(iv)  Tender documents for civil works will include provisions to ensure contractors\u2019 \npreferential hiring of local labor and guaranteeing equal opportunities for female \nworkers and equal pay for work of equal value in compliance with the labor laws \nand regulations of Viet Nam. It will also be ensured that the necessary measures \nare taken to prevent employment of child labor. \n(v)  Where subprojects link with tertiary infrastructure (either existing or planned), \nmeasures will be taken to ensure that plans will be developed for the O&M of the \ntertiary infrastructure concurrently with subproject planning. \n(vi)  Measures  will  be  taken  to  ensure  that  subprojects  will  not  adversely  affect \nindigenous people, households headed by women, disabled, elderly or other \nsimilarly vulnerable groups. In the event that indigenous people are affected by \nor are beneficiaries of any subproject, MARD will ensure that their rights and \nneeds are fully in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous peoples and the \nIndigenous Peoples Development Framework (IPDF). Where the ethnic minority \npopulation of the subproject area exceeds 20% of subproject affected persons, \nan Indigenous People\u2019s Development Plan will be incorporated into resettlement \nplan and subproject scope for approval of ADB in accordance with the IPDF and \nthe relevant regulations of the Government and ADB policies. \n(vii)  An environmental impact assessment and a resettlement plan acceptable to ADB \nwill be prepared for each category B subproject in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy and resettlement framework and the relevant regulations of \nthe Government. \n(viii)  The Government will cause CPMU to ensure participating provinces undertake \nfull community participation and awareness raising initiatives in accordance with \nthe public consultation plan agreed between the Government and ADB prior to \nand during the implementation of subprojects. The Government will also ensure \nthat a grievance mechanism is established for affected people in the participating \nprovinces. \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that adequate funds are allocated for the routine \nand periodic maintenance of infrastructure under the Project through provincial \nbudgets in order to maintain the infrastructure in sound functional order. \n ", "20 \n \nB.

Recent Macroeconomic Performance \n1.  Viet Nam has been one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies in recent years. Gross \ndomestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of just over 8% in 2005, underpinned \nby both strong domestic demand and exports. Despite this recent macroeconomic performance, \npoverty remains an issue. Analysis of the 2002 Multipurpose Household Survey data confirmed \na continuing decline in the incidence of poverty, from 58% in 1993 to 37% in 1998 and 29% in \n2002. The decline in recent years has not been uniform across the country. Poverty in the \nMekong Delta area showed the sharpest drop (from 37% in 1998 to 23% in 2002) while it \nremained  the  highest  in  the  Central  Highlands  (about  52%).  Poverty  is  closely  linked  to \nagricultural opportunities. \n \nB.  Infrastructure, Agriculture, and Economic Growth \n2.  Underpinning  Viet  Nam\u2019s  impressive  economic  growth  has  been  the  national \ninfrastructure investment program focused on three levels: (i) national mainstream infrastructure  \nsuch as major roads and highways, along with power generation and the rehabilitation of major \nirrigation schemes; (ii) small-scale, grassroots investments at the village and commune level, \noften with the assistance of bilateral donors and NGOs, but also through the Government\u2019s own \ninfrastructure program (Program 135); and (iii) medium-scale investments linking these two \ntypes, such as the ADB funded Rural Infrastructure Sector Project (RISP) and the World Bank\u2019s \n(WB\u2019s) first and second Rural Transport Projects. In each year since 1997, total investment in \ninfrastructure  has  outpaced  GDP  growth  (averaging  about  10%  of  GDP  each  year,  and \nrepresenting about 45% of total investment over the period).1 \n \n3.  As a result of this investment in infrastructure (including irrigation and rural transport), \nthe agricultural sector has grown at about 4% per annum since 1998.2 Earlier, the sector \nresponded well to major policy changes (including land decollectivization) initiated by doi moi 3 \nin the late 1980s. Market forces (both domestic and external) now largely drive production and \ntrade in agriculture. Domestic markets are deepening as increasing incomes and urbanization \nincrease consumer demand for a greater diversity and quality of higher value products across \ncrop, livestock, and fishery subsectors. The growing market orientation is also linking farmer \nproduction  choices  and  incentives  more  closely  with  world  price  signals  and  market \npreferences.  Transport  access  and  costs  are  fundamental  in  determining  input  and  crop \navailability and prices, production margins, and farm incomes that, in turn, depend upon the \nstock of physical rural infrastructure such as irrigation facilities and the quality of services it \naffords. This is confirmed by recent analyses of the determinants of agricultural growth that \nidentify the relative contribution of changes in agricultural inputs and of total factor productivity \nas the residual explanation for growth in the agricultural sector. Data from these studies show \nthat future growth will increasingly have to come from total factor productivity sources, including \nthrough gains in the efficiency of rural infrastructure. \n \n4.  Rural transport infrastructure is also a critical contributor to the general development \nprocess of structural transformation of the economy. Despite the decline in relative importance \nof the agriculture sector within the economy, agriculture still plays a very important role in the \n                                                 \n1  WB. 2006.

Washington, DC  \n3  The reform process which started in 1986 is known as Doi Moi or the politics of renovation, is geared towards \ninstituting market-based reforms in the economy. \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \nlivelihoods of a majority of the country\u2019s population; 80% of people remain in rural areas and the \nsector still employs (fully or partly) around two thirds of the national labor force. However, this \ninvolvement  with  agricultural  activities  is  increasingly  part-time  (and  also  increasingly \ndisproportionately female-oriented); only about a quarter of rural households are exclusively \nengaged in farming, while the rest combine farming with waged and nonfarm employment. The \npicture that emerges from recent income and poverty studies4 across the country is that while \nmany rural households are diversifying their activities, most wish to retain farming as a major \nsource of income for at least some family members. This implies that for labor generally (and for \nindividual  family  members)  to  be  able  to  do  this,  reliable  and  cheap  rural  transport  is  as \nessential as the availability of income opportunities off-farm. \n \nC.  Rural Infrastructure and Poverty in the Central Region \n5.  The Central Region has one of the highest incidences of poverty in the country, with \nover 37% of the national total. The underlying causes of this poverty are both geographical and \nhistorical. The topographic and climatic conditions are diverse and complicated, but in general \nthey hinder rather than favor broad-based, large-scale agricultural development. Outside of a \nnarrow  alluvial  coastal  plain  the  land  is sloping  and  the  soils  are generally  unfertile.  This \ntogether  with  frequent  natural  disasters  (storms,  floods,  and  drought),  make  agricultural \nproduction difficult and compound other environmental problems (including soil erosion, land \ndegradation, and deforestation).5 \n \n6.  Two  essentially  historical  factors  also  contribute  to  the  nature  of  the  current \nsocioeconomic situation in the Central Region. The first is the extent of devastation inflicted on \nthe physical infrastructure caused during the wars of the second half of the 20th century (the \nDemilitarized Zone runs right across the Central Region). The second factor is the relative \nunderinvestment in the region\u2019s physical and social capital in recent years, as the national \npriorities were directed to promoting development in the two most populous, and promising, \nregions\u2014the Red River and Mekong deltas. The net effect of these factors has been to leave \nthe Central Region relatively underdeveloped, and this is reflected in the physical infrastructure \nstock (i.e., a high proportion of unsealed roads, the obvious need for canal linings, and required \nimprovements to the rural water supply and coastal infrastructure). \n \n7.  Examination of the rural infrastructure stock in the provinces of the Central Region in \nparticipating provinces confirms that (i) an imperative for further investment is justified, and (ii) \nthere is significant scope for improvement. The proportion of sealed district roads ranges from \nas low as 2% to a maximum of 48%, over 400,000 hectares (ha) of irrigation facilities are in \nneed of rehabilitation, some 25,000 kilometers (km) of primary and secondary irrigation canals \nare in need of lining, and over a third of the rural population do not yet have clean water \nsupplies. Also, while the documented benefits from the RISP were considerable (substantial \ndecreases in poverty, and household income gains of up to 40%), the coverage of that project in \nterms of its aggregate impact on all rural infrastructure in the Central Region was modest, \ntypically renovating only 6\u201315% of the district roads in each of its provinces and 5\u201325% of \nirrigated areas (Supplementary Appendix A). \n \n8.  The causal nature of the relationship between the rural infrastructure stock and peoples\u2019 \nlivelihoods (especially including the ways in which poverty is impacted) was examined through \n                                                 \n4  Klump, Rainer, and Thomas Bonschab. 2004.

What  was  apparent  is  that  both  addressing  rural \npoverty  and  promoting  economic  growth  requires  investment  across  a  range  of  rural \ninfrastructure (roads, irrigation and water supplies, and coastal works) because income sources, \nsocial and welfare activities, and population locations differ throughout the region, requiring \ndifferent interventions. The primary need in relation to rural roads, irrigation, drainage, and flood \ncontrol works in the Central Region is to rehabilitate (and slightly expand) existing networks and \nsystems, while in rural water supply and sanitation the main need is to construct new systems in \nplaces presently without safe drinking water. Similarly, investment in coastal works may involve \nrehabilitating  existing  dikes  and  fish  landings,  but  might  also  include  new  environmental \nactivities such as sand dune stabilization and mangrove planting. \n \n9.  Subprojects must be contextually appropriate so they will sustainably lift people out of \npoverty. Irrigation rehabilitation and water supply establishment are expected to address the \nneeds of the poorer communities. Rural road improvements can be expected to benefit the \nmore productive commercial activities and the relatively poor in the surrounding population, as \nthey make use of increased employment and marketing opportunities, and also the absolute \npoorest in terms of reductions in cost of access to health, education, and social facilities.6 By \nproviding rural infrastructure improvements to various groups (especially indigenous peoples) in \nthe  participating  provinces,  the  underlying  dynamic  economic  growth  model  is  inclusive  in \nnature. Whilst physical investment will predominate in such an undertaking due to the relatively \nhigh  cost,  the  analysis  revealed  that  underlying  issues  of  finance,  planning,  community \nparticipation,  and  capacity  building  must  also  be  addressed  if  the  core  problem  is  to  be \neffectively addressed. These two factors together provide the logic in delivering the desired \nproject impact of improved livelihoods. \n \nD.  Government Plans and Priorities \n10.  The Government remains committed to maintaining high levels of national economic \ngrowth  and  to  achieving  structural  transformation  of  the  economy,  as  it  does  to  reducing \npoverty. The planning and policy agenda for the sector as a whole is moving in the right \ndirection  (in  terms  of  issues  such  as  financing  and  cost  recovery),  and  is  already  being \npromoted under Program 135 and the Third Rural Transport Project. Such trends are in need of \nsupport rather than wholesale reform as such, hence the suitability of a sector modality as \nopposed to a policy-based program loan with budget support. \n \n11.  The  Government  recognizes  the  role  of  infrastructure  in  national  development  and \npoverty reduction planning in both the Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, \nand the current 5-year socio-economic development plan (SEDP).7 The SEDP identifies a clear \nrole for rural transport, water supply, and other infrastructure as supporting various sector \nobjectives (e.g., \u201cthe State budget will be focused only on critical areas such as irrigation, \ntransport, and clean water supply to intensify investment in agriculture and rural development\u201d \n[footnote 6]). In planning for the northern-central and central-coastal areas in particular, the \nSEDP also talks of raising GDP per capita to $700\u2013800 by 2010, partly through \u201ccomprehensive \ninfrastructure development\u201d (footnote 6) including (i) road-building to provide all-weather links \nbetween the eastern and western areas of this region (from areas of agriculture production to \ncoastal towns and seaports) and from highland areas to Cambodia and the Lao PDR; (ii) the \nupgrading of large irrigation works and the linking of irrigation and flood protection schemes, \n                                                 \n6 Improving transport facilities is of course only part of the solution to improving access to health, education, and social \nservices; however, without such investments the benefits of increased spending on new facilities such as hospitals, \nschools, and colleges in rural areas will be compromised. \n7  Government of Viet Nam. 2006.

Hanoi. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nespecially in Nghe Anh and Thanh Hoa provinces (the two largest participating provinces); and \n(iii) developing rural markets and fishing services. \n \nE.  ADB Plans and Priorities \n12.  ADB has similarly recognized the role of rural infrastructure and poverty reduction in its \nupdated country strategy and program8 by better linking rural areas to emerging economic \ncorridors and by supporting the provision of missing physical and social infrastructure (such as \nrural water supply and sanitation). Limitations in physical infrastructure are identified as one of \nthe main hindrances to accelerated private sector-led growth, as well as to socially inclusive \ngrowth. ADB\u2019s past experience in the rural infrastructure sector in Viet Nam has been generally \nfavorable.  Similar  ADB-funded  projects  in  the  past  have  included  the  Irrigation  and  Flood \nProtection Rehabilitation Project,9 the Red River Delta Water Resources Sector Project ,10 and \nthe RISP. The Ministry of Agriculture and Regional Development (MARD) was the executing \nagency for all three projects. ADB is planning further investment of a similar nature in the \nnorthern  mountains  and  hills  regions,  for  which  a  project  preparatory  technical  assistance \n(PPTA) is included in the country strategy and program. \n \nF.  The Role and Priorities of Other Donors \n13.  Following the RISP in the late 1990s, other donors have since funded rural infrastructure \nprojects. These donors include, among others, Department for International Development, WB, \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development,  Finnish  Department  for  Development \nCooperation,  and  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency.  About  10 \ncommune-level  rural  development  projects  are  currently  being  implemented  in  the  Central \nRegion,  leading  to  a  situation  in  which  a  large  amount  of  tertiary  infrastructure  has  been \nconstructed without the supporting medium- or secondary-level infrastructure to link it to the \nmain  national  networks.11 WB  and  ADB  have  also  included  significant  rural  infrastructure \nprovision as part of other projects such as the ADB funded Forestry Sector Project, the Central \nRegion Livelihood Improvement Project and the WB-funded Agriculture Diversification Project. \nWB\u2019s  main  thrust  in  rural  infrastructure  to  date  has  been  through  two  commune-targeted \nprojects  (the  Northern  Areas  Poverty  Reduction  Project  and  the  Community-Based  Rural \nInfrastructure Project) and three provincial level rural transport projects (the first, second, and \nthird Rural Transport Projects). \n \n14.  The focus within the sector on project or sector lending is in transition as some donors \nwill soon be joining WB for an ambitious program approach to rural infrastructure development \nbuilding on the Government\u2019s Program 135. WB will provide direct budget support ($700 million) \nfor grassroots-level rural infrastructure provision along with policy and institutional adjustments \nto ensure that funds will be properly spent and adequately monitored. \n \n15.  Most prior ADB investments in rural infrastructure focused on secondary level, medium-\nscale infrastructure. This will be the case with the proposed Project and also the future project \nplanned for the northern mountains. ADB investments are therefore seen as complementary to \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update Viet Nam 2006\u20132008.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nSocialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Red River Delta Water Resources Sector Project.

To ensure that viable subprojects are identified, and to assure they will have the greatest \npossible  impact  upon  the  socioeconomic  conditions  of  target  beneficiaries,  identification  of \neligible subprojects will follow a two-stage process, one at the completion of the subproject \ninvestment proposals (SIPs) and the second upon completion of the subproject investment \nreports (SIRs). To improve the overall impact of project interventions, potential links with other \ndevelopment initiatives will result in such subprojects receiving higher priority during selection \nand  prioritization  of  subprojects  for  funding.  These  subprojects  may  include  strategically \nimportant investments (such as provincial roads linking several district-level roads to a main \nhighway,  or  the  lining  of  key  sections  of  irrigation  canals  to  prevent  water  loss  through \nseepage), where higher benefits can be obtained than from new infrastructure. In situations \nwhere such links cannot be substantiated, yet the social benefits are substantial (as might be \nanticipated in the more remote and less populated areas), the lack of obvious links should not \nprevent the subproject from being implemented. The adoption of an economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) figure of 10% for accepting subprojects reflects the fact that some benefits (such \nas social benefits) are not readily quantifiable and the use of the EIRR level of 10% should \nensure  that  subprojects  in  less  viable  areas  are  not  disadvantaged  through  the  selection \nprocess.  \n \nA.  Screening at Subproject Investment Proposal Stage \n2.  The following screening criteria are to be applied at the SIP stage. \n \n(i)  The subproject must be included in the provincial socioeconomic development \nplan  and  will  be  expected  to  have  significant  impact  on  poverty  reduction, \neconomic growth, and livelihood improvement. \n(ii)  Priority will be accorded to those subprojects that can demonstrate obvious links \nwith other development initiatives to further enhance the overall impact, or where \nthey improve access to other public services and economic opportunities. \n(iii)  The subproject cost is estimated at greater than $0.5 million but less than $4.0 \nmillion. This cost range is specified to ensure that the number of beneficiaries is \nmaximized, that development is not concentrated in a small area of the province \nbut is more widely spread, and that the provincial project management units \n(PPMUs) do not have too many separate contracts to administer. If deemed of \nhigh priority, a number of smaller subprojects in one sector could be combined \ninto one subproject. \n(iv)  Comprehensive public consultations have been undertaken and documented in \nSIPs within all affected or participating communes. \n(v)  The subproject has no significant resettlement impact, no significant impact upon \nvulnerable people, particularly ethnic minority groups (Supplementary Appendix \nK), no obvious negative environmental impact, and is likely to have an EIRR of \ngreater than 10%. \n(vi)  The  subproject  proposal  outlines  feasible  and  fundable  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  arrangements  with  implementing  organizations  identified \nand sources of funds clearly identified. \n(vii)  The subproject is a coherent scheme in an identified subsector(s) with provision \nfor  links  with  additional  livelihood-enhancement  activities  or  other  donor  or \n ", "  Appendix 4  31 \ngovernment  programs  or  projects,  and  is  supported  by  existing  tertiary \ninfrastructure, or will include such tertiary works as appropriate. \n \nB.    Screening at Subproject Investment Report Stage \n3.  The following screening criteria are to be applied at the SIR stage. \n \n(i)  The subproject is shown to be technically feasible and expected benefits have \nbeen clearly identified. In addition, the subproject is shown to have an EIRR of \nreturn in excess of 10% although this should not exclude those subprojects with \nmore significant social and poverty impacts. \n(ii)  The selected subproject will be cost effective as measured by the unit cost per \nbeneficiary, with priority being given to those with the least cost per beneficiary \nwhile providing the greatest benefit in terms of the estimated EIRR. \n(iii)  Procurement  packages  have  been  clearly  identified,  as  have  the  method  of \nprocurement; cost estimates have been clearly identified and recorded and all \nsources of funding have been identified, agreed, and confirmed. \n(iv)  The SIR contains a detailed financing plan for O&M. This requires that an O&M \nentity shall be specified and both a budget amount and corresponding source of \nfunding specified and agreed upon by the provincial people\u2019s committee and \nother concerned parties to ensure that the overall project investments will be \nfinancially viable and sustainable. \n(v)  Public  consultation  on  the  subproject  proposal  has  been  held  in  concerned \ncommunes  and  measures  for  future  public  consultation  at  all  stages  of \nimplementation are clearly defined. \n(vi)  The subproject is shown to have no major negative environmental or social \nimpacts and mitigation measures have been defined for minor impacts. \n(vii)  The subproject is shown to have no significant resettlement impacts and, where \nneeded,  a  resettlement  plan  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  the \nresettlement framework and the relevant regulations of the Government of Viet \nNam and ADB policy. \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 5 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES \n \nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates by Expenditure Category \n \nCost ($ million)   \nItem  Foreign  Local  Total  % of Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost  Base Cost \nA.

The lack of sustainability of infrastructure development has long been recognized as a \nserious  problem  in  Viet  Nam.  With  the  devolution  of  responsibility  for  maintenance  to  the \nprovinces  where  there  are  limited  revenue-raising  opportunities,  resources  are  scarce  and \navailable funds are channeled into establishing new infrastructure at the expense of maintaining \nexisting structures. The Government is now in a position to reassess its policies in respect of \nrural  infrastructure  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  More  recently,  there  has  been  a \ntendency to overdesign (using higher cost structures), acknowledging that there will be limited \nfunds available for maintenance in the future. There is an urgent need to change attitudes to \ninfrastructure  maintenance  and,  consequently,  the  budgetary  allocations  from  national  and \nprovincial  budgets  for  these  purposes.  New  policies  need  to  be  developed  in  respect  of \ninfrastructure maintenance and there are many projects that have addressed this issue from \ndifferent perspectives. The proposed advisory technical assistance (ADTA) will provide the \nresources to engage necessary technical expertise to review these options to recommend to the \nGovernment the most appropriate means of addressing this critical issue. The ADTA will also \nprovide supplementary capacity building in the various technical areas covered by the proposed \nProject, and provide technical specialists to develop appropriate training material while providing \nthe resources for local institutions for delivery of the training material. \n \n2.  In addition, there has recently been greater emphasis by the Government and donors \nalike on the inclusion of safeguard measures (environment, resettlement, and social issues) \nwhen undertaking infrastructure development. This was attempted under the recently completed \nRural Infrastructure Sector Project (RISP) but met with mixed success as provincial staff in \nparticipating provincial project management units (PPMUs) did not understand the incremental \nbenefits  to  be  gained  from  attending  to  safeguard  matters  (increasing  ownership-making \ninvestments are more sustainable and designs more appropriate). The ADTA will (i) provide \nresources to engage a project start-up specialist who is familiar with safeguard matters, (ii) \nensure that current laws and decrees devolve the responsibility for rural development to local \nadministrations, and (iii) assign responsibilities to local administrations for safeguard practices \nfor such matters as land acquisition and resettlement, environmental impact assessment and \nmitigation,  and  community  participation  in  decision  making.  Similarly,  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \nsafeguard requirements have become more rigorous, as have their requirements for financial \nmanagement  and  procurement.  These  policies  need  to  be  understood  by  all  personnel \nassociated with internationally funded development projects. \n \n3.  The ADTA will support the CPMU and PPMUs with advisory technical assistance to \n(i) provide guidance and assistance at both national and provincial levels for further policy \ndevelopment in anticipation of future investments in the sector, (ii) provide extensive awareness \nraising and technical capacity building in the provinces based on lessons learned under donor \nprograms, and (iii) ensure that both Viet Nam\u2019s and ADB\u2019s policies and procedures are fully \nunderstood and followed during implementation. The main thrust of new policy improvement will \nbe a thorough analysis of practical steps that could be initiated to address critical challenges in \nO&M as it relates to rural roads, rural irrigation, water supply systems, and markets, and \nrecommended measures to accommodate O&M financing requirements.

In view of the sector lending modality, an economic analysis has been carried out on the \nproposed loan based on ADB guidelines.1 The proposed Project is an investment loan, but \nbecause  of  the  significant  number  and  location  of  potential  subprojects  within  the  target \nprovinces2 it was not possible to identify all subprojects during the design phase, nor was it \nappropriate as the Government has already demonstrated a capacity to implement a sector \nmodality project.3 The Project also seeks to influence policy reform4 and thereby qualifies as a \nsector loan. It will \u201csystematize the present ad hoc approach to sector development through \nemphasis\u2026on considerations in the development of the sector\u201d,5 an ADB requirement for a \nsector loan. A more detailed analysis of four representative subprojects (to confirm they are \neconomically  viable  and  that  they  will  contribute  to  poverty  reduction)  is  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix C. Further material on the sector and planning contexts for the rural \ninfrastructure sector is contained in Appendix 2. \n \nA.  Rationale for Government Involvement \n2.  The Government\u2019s Five-Year Socio-Economic Development Plan (SEDP) (2006\u20132010) \nhas three main outcomes targeted for the 5-year period: (i) growth, to boost the economic \ngrowth rate, quickly but sustainably bringing the country out of the low development state (to \nreach  per  capita  income  of  $950\u20131,000  by  2010);  (ii)  social  development,  to  significantly \nimprove  people\u2019s  material,  cultural,  and  spiritual  life;  and  (iii)  good  governance,  to  create \ninstitutional  and  infrastructure  foundations  to  boost  the  industrialization  and  modernization \nprocess and gradual transformation into a knowledge-based economy. To achieve its economic \ngrowth objective, the Government proposes to (i) liberalize markets, (ii) develop infrastructure, \n(iii) promote science and technology, (iv) improve factor productivity, (v) improve the quality of \nresource allocation and use, and (vi) proactively accelerate international economic integration to \npromote exports and foreign investment. To achieve and maintain its high gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) annual growth rate of 7.5%, Viet Nam needs to develop physical infrastructure \nand maintain investment levels of at least 35% of GDP. \n \n3.  The other rationale for Government involvement is that because rural infrastructure is a \npublic  good,  infrastructure  investments  tend  to  require  large  capital  resources,  and  this \nprecludes private investment. In addition, the means for recovering rents or user charges are \nnot well developed in Viet Nam (although tollways are effective on national routes). With the \npossible exception of irrigation facilities and water supplies, benefits are distributed over a large \nand  unidentifiable  number  of  users,  reinforcing  the  public  nature  of  the  investment.  Rural \ninfrastructure  is  essentially  a  public  good;  the  responsibility  rests  with  the  Government  to \nprovide an appropriate environment to facilitate private investment. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB Economics Research Division. 2005.Technical Note No.14: Economic Analysis of a Sector Loan.

Operations Manual. Section D3/OP: Sector Lending. Manila (29 October). \n ", "46  Appendix 12 \nB.  Goals of the Plan \n4.  The  main  elements  of  the  Government\u2019s  rural  infrastructure  strategy  include  (i)  an \nemphasis on rural roads, particularly a complete grid of all-weather roads in the supply areas for \nthe major urban centers and a focus on much simpler linkages in remote areas; (ii) a decision to \ndesign and implement as much rural infrastructure development as practicable at provincial and \nlower levels with beneficiary or user participation; (iii) capacity development with regard to \ntraining  and  equipment  so  as  to  allow  provinces  to  plan  effectively  without  waste  and  to \nsupervise  construction;  (iv)  preparation  and  monitoring  of  standards  for  new  works  and \nmaintenance; (v) priorities established for major national water projects within an overall plan; \n(vi) a system to determine priorities for national funding contributions to provincial infrastructure \nplans;  and  (vii) effective  cost-recovery  systems  and  practical,  funded  management  and \nmaintenance  programs  in  place.  In  the  SEDP  plans  for  the  Northern  Central  and  Central \nCoastal regions, targets include raising per capita GDP to $700\u2013800 by 2010. For the Central \nHighlands region, the rural infrastructure focus is more on small- to medium-scale irrigation \nworks, development of rural markets to support commodity-based border and domestic trade, \nand the development of side roads, feeder roads, and border roads from the National Highway \n1A. The various ways in which the provision of rural infrastructure supports economic growth \nand poverty reduction in a range of situations are outlined in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Government Plans \n5.  Details of Government plans and priorities are given in Section D of Appendix 2. \n  \nD.  Associated Economic Policies \n6.  Two recent policy initiatives that are likely to impact upon the rural infrastructure sector \n(other than the sector development policy itself) are (i)  the policy on decentralization and \ngrassroots identification of priority public investments, and (ii) the policy for maintaining rural \ninfrastructure. The Government has given significant importance to the commune-identified \ninvestments and has provided funding to resource the implementation of these investments \n(e.g., Program 135, funded from Government resources) and other bilaterally and multilaterally \nfunded initiatives. Infrastructure items identified through these tend to be smaller-scale public \ninvestments of immediate relevance to the concerned communities. They tend not to have the \nbroader economic development rationale or any appreciation of the larger-scale development \nissues. This has created an opportunity for coordination with these smaller-scale investments to \nincrease  their  impact.  Linking  a  number  of  village  or  commune  roads  with  district  road \nrehabilitation has the potential for a far greater impact than the road alignment in its own right. \n \n7.  The second policy is related to the resources of provinces and their financial capacity to \nmaintain rehabilitated structures. The Government is clear in its desire to recover operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) costs from the immediate beneficiaries using rural infrastructure. Local \nauthorities have been charged with responsibility for setting user charges to recover O&M costs. \nFor  the  larger  items  with  broad-based  benefits,  contracts  are  provided  to  state-owned \nenterprises to operate and maintain state assets. The pricing policy of local administrations, \nhowever, does not provide for full cost recovery and in many cases recovered user-charges are \ninsufficient to meet immediate O&M needs, particularly in the case of rural water supply and \nsanitation. Local authorities consider that they must retain responsibility for maintaining services \nto the public at subsidized prices. The subsidy that would allow comprehensive maintenance is \nnot provided from provincial budgetary allocations; inevitably, assets deteriorate. The policy is \n ", "  Appendix 12     47 \nbased  on  social  considerations  and  is  highly  political  given  the  limited  capacity  of  some \nhouseholds to afford tariffs set to achieve full cost recovery. With the limited resources available \nin the districts and provinces to subsidize user charges, combined with a lack of appreciation of \nthe  need  for  routine  and  periodic  maintenance  (or  at  least  the  benefits  thereof),  rural \ninfrastructure is seldom maintained in sound working order. The various dimensions of this \nplanning and financing problem, and the nature of the resulting impacts upon rural livelihoods, \nare explained in more detail in Appendix 2. The Project has addressed this issue by capacity \nbuilding  for  O&M  requirements  and  by  providing  higher  initial  capital  costs  for  structures \n(increasing design standards). However, the policy of allowing local authorities to set user fees \nat subsidized rates will impact upon the sustainability of the investments under the Project. \n \nE.  Government and Local Consultant Capacity \n8.  The Government has demonstrated a capacity to implement an ADB-funded sector \nmodality project (the RISP) between 1998 and 2005 (footnote 2). In addition, the Government \nhas recently completed the first and second Rural Transport Projects implemented by the \nnational Government (i.e., centralized) project management unit. These projects have generally \nbeen regarded as satisfactory in terms of implementation efficiency and overall development \nimpact; over 6,800 kilometers (km) of basic access roads were rehabilitated, and the projects \nhelped to improve capacity to plan and implement work at the national level, and contributed to \nthe  emergence  of  private-sector  contractors  in  the  country.  The  ADB-funded  RISP  was \nimplemented through provincial project management units where there was significant capacity \nbuilding in the identification, design, works supervision, and in general project management. \nWhile it was assessed that more capacity building was needed6 in the areas of safeguards and \neconomic  evaluation,  the  project  was  rated  as  successful,  demonstrating  that  capacity  to \nimplement a sector modality project has been established. However, the project completion \nreport recommended (i) that further devolution should not be attempted too hastily, (ii) that there \nbe a period of consolidation, and (iii) the refinement of local consultant capabilities in the social \naspects of identification and design. Similarly, the capacities of the local consultants to prepare \ntechnically sound and appropriate detailed designs and to supervise works construction have \nbeen demonstrated. \n \nF.  Fiscal Impacts \n9.  Most of the rural infrastructure being rehabilitated or established under the Project will be \nof  sufficient  size  that  it  is  unlikely  that  communities  will  assume  responsibility  for  its \nmaintenance. Wherever possible, the Government is committed to charging user fees to provide \nfor, or at least contribute towards, O&M requirements. Where is it possible to identify and \ncharge local beneficiaries for contributions to O&M (as is the case in rural water supply and \nsanitation, markets,  and  irrigation subprojects),  the  immediate  beneficiaries  will be  able  to \ncontribute to routine maintenance. For roads, the funding of routine maintenance will inevitably \nbecome the responsibility of the provinces, as will periodic maintenance requirements of other \ninfrastructure. This places a significant demand on provincial and district resources to maintain \nrehabilitated infrastructure along with their increased capital stock of infrastructure. While the \nrevenue-raising  capacity  of  the  predominantly  rural  provinces  is  limited,  the  issue  of \nsustainability is very much dependent upon central Government allocations. Sustainability is \npartly an issue of financial management but is more one of limited resources. \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2006.

A review of the financial position of the 13 target provinces shows significant growth in \nthe level of financial activity, sources of funding, and the allocation of these funds to both capital \nand recurrent expenditure. In the period ended December 2004, annual budget receipts per \ncapita (from all sources) in the target provinces varied between D0.6 million and D2.9 million, \nwith Binh Dinh the lowest and Kon Tum the highest (the latter due to large transfers from the \ncentral Government). Annual per capita expenditure ranged between D0.8 million and D2.4 \nmillion  with  most  budgets  being  balanced  (made  possible  by  transfers  from  the  central \nGovernment). Provinces maintain their focus on funding capital investments that accounted for, \non  average,  28%  of  provincial  expenditure.  Provincial  allocations  for  routine  and  periodic \nmaintenance  of  infrastructure  have  been  estimated  to  be  approximately  40%  of  actual \nrequirements.  The  heavy  dependence  on  the  central  Government  for  budget  resources \naverages 61% for target provinces, but ranged from 42% in the case of Thua Thien-Hue to 81% \nin Kon Tum. \n \n11.  The Project and associated ADTA have designed the capacity building to raise the \nawareness  of  provincial  decision  makers  to  achieve  increased  allocations  for  routine  and \nperiodic maintenance allocations from provincial budgets, but this continues to be a challenge \nfacing  the  resource-poor  provinces.  Furthermore,  as  their  respective  economies  develop, \ngreater allocations will be needed for recurrent expenditure rather than maintaining the focus on \ninvestment and capital infrastructure as was needed in the period following the cessation of \nconflict to rehabilitate the dilapidated infrastructure. \n \n12.  ADB funds are not fully fungible as the three financing sources\u2014ADB, AFD, and the \nGovernment\u2014have already been specified in the design for the identified subprojects. The \nallocation of counterpart funds proved to be a major concern during the implementation of the \nRISP as 20% funding was sought from the provinces. \n \nG.  Economic Risks \n13.  The major economic risk to the successful outcome of the Project is the need for \nperiodic and routine maintenance to sustain benefits. The economic analysis in Supplementary \nAppendix C draws attention to the sensitivity of the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for \nthe representative subprojects to maintenance for road subprojects in particular. If the benefit \nstream stops 5 years after rehabilitation, the estimated EIRR becomes negative; if it stops after \n10 years, the EIRR falls below the cost of capital. Specifically, the sensitivity analysis of the Phu \nQuy \u2013 Phuoc Hau, Phuoc Thai \u2013 Lien Son, and Tan Tai \u2013 Xom Lang roads suggests that if \nmaintenance stops after 5 years the EIRRs will be about \u20134.3%, while if maintenance stops \nafter  10  years  the  EIRR  will  only  be  5.9%.  For  the  Hung  Trung  \u2013  Nghi  Kieu  subproject \n(comprising roads, irrigation rehabilitation, and rural markets) the situation is similar, with the \nEIRR being \u20135.5% if maintenance stops after 5 years and 10.1% if it stops after 10 years. \n \n14.  The  importance  of  attending  to  maintenance  of  rehabilitated  structures  cannot  be \noverstated as it has such a dramatic impact upon the benefits achieved. While the identified \neconomic risk is part policy-related in that tariffs do not reflect the real operational cost of \nrehabilitated infrastructure, the risk is equally a function of the limited availability of resources to \nmaintain structures. The subproject identification process will go part of the way to ensuring that \nresources are allocated to the rehabilitated infrastructure, but there is a period of time between \nthe commitment to a maintenance program and the commitment of budgetary resources during \nwhich such undertakings could be forgotten. It is therefore important to formalize commitments \nfor maintenance by the provinces and, wherever possible, set minimum financing amounts for \nspecific items of infrastructure. \n ", "  Appendix 12     49 \n \nH.  Government Commitment \n15.  The commitment of both the central and provincial governments was strong during the \nprevious ADB-funded sector loan, and has been evident again during the preparation of the \nProject. The provinces see considerable merit in the outcomes of the Project as it has been \ndeveloped in a participatory manner with numerous workshops and individual consultations. \nGovernment commitment is clear, in that it financed 31% of the total project cost, compared with \nthe 20% estimated at appraisal for the RISP. Whilst this was provided to ensure that adequate \nstandards  of  design  were  achieved  given  the  unit  cost  limitations  in  the  RISP  project \ndocuments, it substantiates Government commitment to the sector and its development plan. \n \nI.  Coordination of Foreign Aid \n16.  There are a number of international agencies and bilateral donors working in the rural \nand coastal infrastructure sector (Appendix 3) as well as a number of state-funded initiatives \n(such  as  the  Program  135  phase  II).  Clearly  there  is  a  need  to  coordinate  with  these \ndevelopment initiatives at the provincial level. To achieve this coordination, responsibility for \nimplementing  has  been  assigned  to  the  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs).  Provincial \nsteering committees have been proposed to ensure that subprojects will be consistent with the \nprovincial  SEDPs.  Furthermore,  as  PPCs  will  have  a  major  role  in  approving  identified \nsubprojects, and as the selection and prioritization process will be administered by the provincial \nproject management units, it suggests that donor coordination will be effectively handled. \n \nJ.  Conditions Attached to the Loan \n17.  Most conditions for the proposed Project relate to subproject identification and have \nbeen incorporated in the selection criteria. While policy reform may be appropriate in the case of \nthe rural water supply and sanitation sector, the Project is intended to have some impact upon \npolicy development within this sector in respect of the practices for O&M that forms the main \ncondition of the proposed loan. This also constitutes the main risk under the Project that will \nimpact  on  maximizing  benefits  from  the  investment.  Time-bound  and  quantified  provincial \nbudgetary allocations that can be monitored after completion should be established during the \nselection process. \n \nK.  Economic Analysis of Representative Subprojects \n18.  Given the sector modality of the proposed Project, four representative subprojects were \nanalyzed to determine their suitability for funding. In view of the similarity between the proposed \nProject and its predecessor (the RISP), three completed subprojects were reanalyzed using \n2006 costs (indexed from actual costs); they were assessed against demonstrated benefits in \ncurrent 2006 terms. In addition to the three completed subprojects, a new potential subproject7 \nwas evaluated using similar approaches to the completed subprojects under the RISP. Each \nsubproject demonstrated EIRRs in excess of 12%, ranging from 12.2% to 19.9% based on the \nidentified net benefit flows. In each case, there were additional benefits from the investment that \ncould not readily be quantified, and estimates were considered to be conservative. Sensitivity \ntests were carried out to the main potential variables that might impact upon the findings, \nincluding price declines, increases on capital costs, and also a reduction in utilization. The \n                                                 \n7 Hung Trung Nieu Tru road rehabilitation and associated irrigation rehabilitation and market structures. \n ", "50  Appendix 12 \nsensitivity to routine and periodic maintenance was also analyzed with utilization declining to \nprerehabilitation levels after the maintenance ceased. In most cases, the benefits were not \nsensitive to changes in price levels or to increases in the unit investment costs. The area of \ngreatest sensitivity was identified from maintenance practices. Where the maintenance was \nceased after 5 years of operation, the EIRRs fell dramatically below the cost of capital. In cases \nwhere the maintenance ceased after 10 years from completion, the EIRRs were significantly \nreduced (but not to below zero) as most of the benefits would have been received before the \ndeterioration of the infrastructure. This result is more an impact of the method of estimating \nEIRRs,  as  the  more  substantial  benefits  are  those  occurring  immediately  after  the  initial \ninvestment. \n \n ", "    Appendix 13  51 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?    No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Viet Nam: \n \nViet Nam has already achieved the first Millennium Development Goals of halving poverty by 2015 as the national \npoverty rate fell from about 58.1% in 1993 to 24.1% in 2004. Despite the success, regional inequalities remain: \npoverty, particularly extreme poverty, remains heavily concentrated in isolated rural areas and among ethnic minority \ngroups. Over 90% of the poor (73% of the whole population) are found in rural areas. The need for social equity and \nbalanced  development  to  sustain  the  country\u2019s  economic  growth  is  well  recognized  in  the  Government\u2019s \nComprehensive  Poverty  Reduction  and  Growth  Strategy  (CPRGS)  and  its  latest  Five  Year  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan, 2006\u20132010, and ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) (2007\u20132010). Key focuses of the \nCPRGS are the development of a diversified rural economy, inclusive social development, and addressing the needs \nof  the  relatively  impoverished  Central  Region.  Both  plans  place  considerable  emphasis  on  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure, both at the national level and more directly at the provincial, district, and commune levels. The CSP \nrecognizes this priority and has identified limitations in physical infrastructure as one of the main bottlenecks to \naccelerated, private sector-led growth, as well as to socially inclusive growth. \n \nThe Project will contribute to achieve balanced and equitable growth in the 13 provinces in the Central Region. It will \nfund a series of subprojects aimed at rehabilitating and upgrading medium-scale rural and coastal infrastructure such \nas intercommune roads, irrigation facilities, water supply and sanitation, markets, and special coastal zone works. It \nis expected that approximately 50% of the subprojects will be roads to improve access to markets, employment \nopportunities, health centers, and schools by reducing isolation and remoteness of rural communes. It is also \nexpected that another 30% of the subprojects will be irrigation schemes that will increase the productivity of \nagriculture. Improving access to safe water supplies will reduce health and hygiene problems particularly among the \npoor women and children quite apart from the time saved from water collection, a task performed by women and \nchildren. Likewise, markets will promote livelihood diversification by encouraging trade and enable information \nexchange. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project is not a direct poverty intervention because all people will have access to, and benefit from, the various \nsubprojects.  However,  the  Project  will  greatly  benefit  poor  communities  as  subprojects  will  be  located  in \ngeographically poor provinces, where the average rural poverty rate in 13 target provinces is 52%, a figure exceeding \nthe national average of 26.4%. \n \nParticipating provinces are characterized by a long, narrow coastal zone up to about 10 km wide along the coast in \nthe east. This zone borders a flat, productive coastal plain that in turn is flanked by a series of mountains and hills to \nthe west. The most densely populated areas in the provinces are the coastal zones and alluvial plains. The \nmountains and hills tend to be sparsely populated by ethnic minority tribal people. While the greatest absolute \nnumbers of poor are in the coastal zone and the alluvial plain (due the much higher population density), the hill and \nmountain areas have extremely high levels of poverty. Households in mountainous communes are substantially \npoorer, with 56% falling into the poor income group, compared with 22% of households in coastal communes and \n42% of households in plains communes. \n \nAll the provinces are predominantly rural and agricultural. The main economic activity is rice cultivation, and this is \nsupplemented in the coastal zones by capture fisheries and aquaculture. Moreover, the region is also disaster prone, \nbeing subject to typhoons and consequent floods in the rainy season and droughts in the dry season. This adds to \nthe precarious economic situation of the population, most of which lives below or just above the poverty line. Rural \ninfrastructure in the project provinces is in generally poor condition. Approximately 70% of provincial roads are \nunpaved and are impassable during the wet season, while many of the irrigation systems require rehabilitation and \nupgrading. As a result, access to irrigated land and markets is constrained, as are access to services such as health \nand education. A poverty and social assessment (PSA) was undertaken during project preparation covering six \nprovinces and six districts in each province with two districts selected in each of the three agro-environmental zones - \ncoastal, plains, and mountainous. According to the PSA, upgrading of roads and bridges to all-weather surfaces and \nimproving  access to safe  water supplies  are the  highest-ranked  infrastructure development priorities of most \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nsurveyed households, irrespective of gender or ethnicity. Despite the recognition of the need to improve water supply \nand sanitation, survey respondents are more willing to pay for improvements to infrastructure such as roads, \nirrigation, and markets. The PSA also revealed that there are differences between ethnic minority households and \nKinh households with regard to access to infrastructure and services. Only 18% of ethnic minority households live in \nvillages with a health centre (compared with 26% of Kinh households), 5% with a market (compared with 22% of Kinh \nhouseholds), and 15% with a lower-secondary school (20% of Kinh households). Subproject locations are yet to be \ndetermined.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No \n \nA stakeholder analysis was conducted during project preparation to identify key project stakeholders, their project-\nrelated interests, and their potential roles in project implementation. Project field surveys were also conducted and \napproximately 400 potential beneficiaries per province were included. In addition, a number of province and national \nlevel workshops were held during implementation of the preparation study. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA participation strategy has been integrated into the project design and social safeguard documents to ensure that \ndifferent stakeholders continue to participate during implementation. Screening criteria for subproject investment \nproposals include that the public consultations have been undertaken on the subproject proposals within all affected \nor participating communes and feedback from consultations have been included in the proposal. The Project will \nmobilize community participation specialists in order to ensure that stakeholders, particularly beneficiaries, participate \nin sharing information about the Project, determine the location and design of subprojects, and supervise construction \nand  benefit  monitoring.  The  various  safeguard  processes  (resettlement,  ethnic  minority  development,  and \nenvironment) also include consultation and participation of the community as a key step in identification of impacts \nand mitigation measures. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nViet Nam has a long tradition of promoting gender equality, having one of the highest economic participation rates of \nwomen in the world (83%). The PSA concluded that women will be beneficiaries of the Project as around half of all \nworkers in the agriculture sector are women, and compared with men, women contribute more hours of labor to \ncultivation, agricultural processing, and marketing of agricultural produce. In particular, market improvements will \nprimarily benefit women, as over 90% of traders are women. Improvements in water supply may also ease women\u2019s \nphysical burden. \nThe results from the PSA indicate that there is almost no difference between female-head and male-head households \nacross the project area in terms of poverty level, with female-head households being slightly better off than male-\nhead households. With regard to participation of women in community infrastructure planning and implementation, \nacross the project area there is a relatively high participation of women in the decision-making process. Decisions \nabout the types and actual location of new infrastructure had consistent participation of women. Nonetheless, \nsubproject planning and implementation will ensure women, including female household heads, are provided equal \nopportunity to participate in and benefit from the Project. Gender will be an integral part of resettlement plans and \nenvironmental assessments. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes      No \n \nE.

The Integrated Rural Development Sector Project in Central Provinces funds small- and \nmedium-scale investments in rural and coastal infrastructure such as roads, irrigation, water \nsupply, sanitation, and markets in 13 provinces in the Central Region. Negative impacts from \nthe Project are considered small and are likely to be confined to (i) permanent loss of small \nareas of land adjacent to the works, (ii) minor damage to structures, crops, and trees, (iii) \ntemporary loss or disruption of the use of land or other assets caused by construction works; \nand (iv) the movement of construction plant and materials to and from work sites. Few, if any, \npeople will be severely affected by land acquisition. In accordance with the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), the Project is classified category B. Full \nresettlement plans (as required for category  A projects) will not be required because any \nsubproject  with  significant  resettlement  impact  will  not  be  eligible  for  funding 1 .  Short \nresettlement plans will be prepared for any subprojects found to have land acquisition and \nresettlement impacts up to the limits for category B. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n2.  The resettlement framework is prepared based on laws, regulations, and policies of the \nGovernment of Viet Nam and ADB policies and guidelines. It was endorsed by the Government \nand  guides  the  preparation  of  resettlement  plans  (should  any  be  needed)  during  project \nimplementation. The provisions and principles adopted in this framework and subsequent plans \nwill supersede the provisions of the relevant decrees currently in force in Viet Nam wherever a \ngap exists, as provided for under Decree 131/2006/ND-CP (November 2006), which regulates \nthe management and use of official development assistance. \n \n3.  The project entitlement matrix (Table A15.1) summarizes the main types of losses and \nthe corresponding nature and scope of entitlement. The extent of impact on vulnerable groups \nincluding ethnic minority groups and other disadvantaged groups\u2014such as the landless, poor, \nhouseholds headed by women, elderly, and disabled\u2014who should receive special economic \nrehabilitation programs will be determined during preparation of subproject investment reports \n(SIR) and resettlement plans. If the ethnic minority population exceeds 20% of all the affected \npersons,  special  economic  rehabilitation  programs  specifically  targeted  to  ethnic  minority \naffected persons will be prepared in consultation with the ethnic minority affected persons. The \ndetails are found in the separate Ethnic Minority Development Framework (Supplementary \nAppendix I). \n \nC.  Institutional Framework \n4.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), through the Central Project \nManagement Unit (CPMU) of its Agricultural Projects Management Board, will assure overall \nplanning, coordination, and reporting for the Project. In each of the 13 participating provinces, \nthe  respective  Departments  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (DARD),  through  their \nprovincial  project  management  units  (PPMUs),  will  prepare  and  implement  subprojects.  A \nsafeguard officer will be appointed in each PPMU. The CPMU and PPMU will liaise with the \nprovincial people\u2019s committee (PPC), and the PPC will request the district people\u2019s committee \n                                                 \n1  As per ADB policy, \u2018significant\u2019 resettlement means that 200 or more people (or approximately 40 households based \non an average size of household) will experience being physically displaced or lose $10 or more of their productive \nassets (income-generating). \n ", "  Appendix 14     55 \n(DPC) in districts where a subproject is located to establish a Compensation, Assistance, and \nResettlement Board (CARB). The CARB will lead the resettlement process for each subproject, \nincluding preparation and implementation of the resettlement plan. The Committee for Ethnic \nMinorities and Mountainous Areas and the Fatherland Front have mandates for ethnic minority \nissues, and these agencies will be included in the special rehabilitation program for ethnic \nminority population wherever possible. \n \nD.  Screening, Preparation, and Implementation of Resettlement Plans \n5.  Based on information given in subproject identification proposals (SIPs), the CPMU will \ndetermine the requirements for resettlement plans using screening and categorization forms. \nDuring the initial screening of SIPs, subprojects likely to have significant resettlement impact will \nbe rejected for ADB funding. \n \n6.  A short resettlement plan will then be prepared for each subproject investment report \n(SIR) where resettlement impacts are unavoidable. The preparation of a subproject resettlement \nplan will use the following procedure. \n \n(i)  Undertake a census of all affected persons. \n(ii)  Undertake an inventory and detailed measurement survey2 of all losses of all \naffected persons. At the same time, inform potential affected persons (without \ndiscrimination)  of  the  subproject,  its  likely  impacts,  and  principles  and \nentitlements as per the resettlement framework. \n(iii)  Undertake a socioeconomic survey3 of at least 10% of all affected persons, 20% \nof severely affected persons and ethnic minority population. \n(iv)  Undertake a replacement cost survey for various types of affected assets as a \nbasis for determining compensation rates at replacement cost. Determine the \nlosses in accordance with the entitlement matrix. \n(v)  Provide project and resettlement information to all persons affected in a form and \nlanguage  understandable  to  them,  and  consult  them  on  compensation  and \nresettlement options, including relocation sites and economic rehabilitation. \n(vi)  In  consultation  with  those  people  affected,  prepare  a  special  rehabilitation \nprogram for affected ethnic minority population when their number exceeds 20% \nof all the affected persons. \n(vii)  Prepare the draft resettlement plans with time-bound implementation schedule, \nprocedures  for  grievance  mechanism,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  and  a \nbudget. \n(viii)  Finalize the subproject resettlement plan in both Vietnamese and English. Submit \nplan to the CPMU for preliminary review, then CPMU will forward it to ADB for \napproval. \n(ix)  Disclose the draft and final resettlement plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s Public \nCommunications  Policy  (2005)  to  the  affected  communities  and  on  ADB\u2019s \nwebsite. The draft resettlement plan will be disclosed prior to submission to ADB \nfor approval. The final resettlement plan will be disclosed after approval. \n                                                 \n2  Data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. \n3  The socioeconomic survey will include gender analysis and data will be disaggregated by gender and ethnicity. \n ", "56  Appendix 14 \n7.  Land acquisition, compensation, and relocation of affected persons cannot commence \nuntil the resettlement plan has been reviewed and approved by ADB. All resettlement activities \nwill be coordinated with the civil works schedule. MARD will ensure that civil works contractors \nwill not be issued a notice of possession of the site until (i) compensation and relocation of \naffected persons have been satisfactorily completed; (ii) agreed rehabilitation assistance is in \nplace; and (iii) the site is free of all encumbrances (where relevant). \nE.  Consultation, Grievance Redress, and Disclosure \n8.  Consultation with the affected persons will take place from the SIR preparation stage, \nand will be completed prior to finalization of detailed designs and resettlement plan so that their \nneeds and preferences can be incorporated into the design where practicable. They will also \nparticipate in the various resettlement plan processes, including (i) preparation of the inventory \nof losses, (ii) validation of compensation rates and entitlements, (iii) handover of entitlements, \n(iv) monitoring of impacts and benefits, and (v) discussion and settlement of grievances. \n \n9.  To  ensure  that  all  grievances  of  those  affected  on  any  aspect  of  land  acquisition, \ncompensation, relocation, and determination and payment of entitlements are resolved in a \ntimely and satisfactory manner, and that all avenues for airing grievances are available, the \nProject will set up a mechanism to deal with any such grievances during project implementation. \nThe affected persons will be made fully aware of their rights (both verbally and in writing) during \nconsultations and at each phase of the resettlement process. Detailed procedures for hearing \nand redressing grievances, including appeal processes, will be made public through an effective \npublic information campaign. The CARB will record and report on all complaints and their \nresolution. An independent monitor will check procedures and resolutions of grievances and \ncomplaints. \n \n10.  The PPMUs, assisted by the resettlement committees, will disclose (i) draft resettlement \nplans prior to submission for review and approval by ADB, (ii) final resettlement plans approved \nby the CPMU and ADB, and (iii) any revisions to resettlement plan as a result of changes in \nscope  or  design  layout.  Key  information  in  resettlement  plan,  including  compensation  and \nrehabilitation options, will be disclosed to affected persons before commencement of civil works. \nThe  information  will  be  made  public  in  a  readily  accessible  location  such  as  village  and \ncommune halls and be in the form of an information leaflet or brochure, all in a form and \nlanguage readily understood by the affected persons. All relevant project information, including \nfinal resettlement plan or specific actions prepared under the Project, will be made freely \navailable in both English and Vietnamese to all affected persons and other interested parties, \nand will be posted on the ADB website following ADB and MARD approval of the related \nsubproject detailed design. \n \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n11.  The  PPMU  will  supervise  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  the  subproject \nresettlement plan and will monitor and report on all resettlement activities. The CARB will submit \nmonthly progress reports to the PPMU which will review and forward them to the CPMU. The \nCPMU will consolidate all provincial reports into the project performance monitoring system, \nwhich will be used to prepare regular progress reports for submission to ADB. Monitoring and \nevaluation will also focus on social impacts and whether the people affected are able to restore, \nand preferably improve, their preproject living standards, incomes, and productive capacity. \n \n ", "  Appendix 14     57 \n12.  The  CPMU  will  recruit  an  independent  monitoring  organization  to  conduct  external \nmonitoring and evaluation of resettlement for the Project, focusing on the social impacts of the \nProject  and  whether  affected  persons  are  able  to  restore,  and  preferably  improve,  their \npreproject  living  standards,  incomes,  and  productive  capacity  about  12  months  after \ncompensation and relocation have been completed. All such reports will be submitted to the \nCPMU and ADB. \nG.  Budget \n13.  All compensation for land and other affected assets will be paid at replacement cost \nbased  on  current  market  prices.  Compensation  rates  will  be  established  for  each  project \nprovince, at replacement cost based on market prices during the replacement cost survey. All \ncosts  for  subproject  resettlement  programs  under  the  Project  including  land  acquisition, \ncompensation and allowances, operation and administration costs, surveys, monitoring, and \nreporting will be financed from loan funds. The commune resettlement committees will be \nresponsible for payment of compensation directly to those affected.
