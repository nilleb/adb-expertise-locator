INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During the Country Programming Mission in December 2007, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \npolicy and advisory technical assistance for a study on improving road safety through the \napplication of intelligent transport systems (ITS). The Fact-Finding Mission visited Beijing in \nDecember  2008  and  reached  agreement  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome, \nmethodology, key activities, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements \nfor the technical assistance (TA). The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nThis TA has also been included in the ADB nonlending program for the PRC for 2009.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Road accidents are a major negative side effect of transport systems. The World Health \nOrganization (WHO) estimates that 1.2 million people are killed in road crashes worldwide each \nyear and as many as 50 million are injured.2 WHO predicts that these figures will increase by \nabout 65% over the next 20 years unless more attention is given to accident prevention. Road \naccident deaths and injuries bring not only a huge economic loss to developing countries, which \namounts to 1%\u20132% of Gross National Product (GNP),3 but also disproportionately harm low-\nincome groups such as pedestrians, and bicycle and motorcycle riders. The majority of road \ntraffic casualties are in the 15\u201344 age group.4 The associated loss of main income earners has \nan adverse effect on standards of living and poverty. \n \n3.  In the PRC, during 2005\u20132007 over 260,000 people were killed in road accidents and \nover 1.2 million people were injured. Based on 2004 data, the fatality rate per vehicle in the \nPRC is more than 9 times that in the United Kingdom and more than 5 times that in the United \nStates. Since the number of motor vehicles in the PRC is expected to rise, the number of \nfatalities will also increase unless effective actions are taken to help the PRC make its roads \nsafer. \n \n4.  The  Government  implements  the  following  policies  to  improve  road  safety: \n(i)   enforcement  of  rules  and  greater  awareness  of  road  safety,  (ii)  improving  roads, \n(iii)   improving  the  safety  of  motor  vehicles,  (iv)  improving  traffic  safety  management,  and \n(v)   developing  technology  to  improve  road  safety.  It  recognizes  that  newly  available \ntechnologies can play an important role in enhancing the impact of these policies. In many \nbusinesses and governments around the world, the construction and operation of transport \nsystems  is  being  transformed  by  computers,  sensors,  and  communications  technology\u2014\ncollectively  called  information  technology  (IT).  ITS  is  the  application  of  IT  to  surface \ntransportation. ITS provides the ability to gather, organize, analyze, use, and share information \nabout transport systems; and to control the systems efficiently and safely. Since most accidents \nare caused by human error or violation of traffic rules, the application of new technology has \ngreat potential for reducing accidents through a combination of monitoring driving behavior, \ngiving warnings to drivers to change their behavior, and controlling transport systems. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 June 2008. \n2  WHO. 2004.

United Kingdom: Transport \nResearch Laboratory. \n4  WHO. 2004. World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention. Geneva. \n ", "2    \n5.  The Ministry of Communications5 (MOC) started research and development on ITS in \nthe 1990s and developed the ITS strategic program. In the past decade, MOC in cooperation \nwith related organizations began deploying ITS applications such as electronic toll collection \nand weather information service. The 11th Five Year Plan for Science and Technology (2006\u2013\n2010)  emphasizes  the  utilization  of  ITS  to  improve  transport  systems,  specifically  in  the \nfollowing three fields: (i) to relieve congestion and increase the capacity of the transportation \nsystem;  (ii)  to  promote  integration  of  the  electronic  information  network  to  maximize  the \nefficiency,  safety,  and  utilization  of  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  to  minimize  the  probability  and \nseverity of collisions and reduce accident losses. In accordance with this plan, the following ITS \ntechnologies were introduced in the public sector in the PRC in recent years: (i) a traffic control \nsystem to alleviate traffic congestion in Beijing, particularly during the 2008 Olympic Games; \n(ii) a traffic information system that provides travelers with traffic information via internet and \nelectric boards in Beijing and Shanghai; and (iii) electronic toll collection on about 4,000 km of \nexpressways by 2008.  \n \n6.  While the 11th Five Year Plan for Science and Technology emphasized utilizing ITS for \nroad safety, implementation is still very limited. The Government is focusing on the following \nfour aspects, which are closely related to important areas of its road safety policy: (i) human \nbehavior,  (ii)  vehicle  safety,  (iii)  commercial  vehicle  management,  and  (iv)  infrastructure. \nHowever, there is no policy or guidance for effectively utilizing ITS to improve road safety. On \nthe other hand, some ITS technologies have been introduced in the transport industry to control \ndriving records for commercial reasons. These technologies have potential for improving road \nsafety since they help to reduce excessive working hours and violations of the speed limit by \nmonitoring driving behavior and helping to change behavior. To realize the full benefits of these \ntechnologies, government guidance and standards are needed. Some technologies also have \npotential  for  improving  road  safety  by  providing  accident  information  that  can  be  used  to \nimprove road infrastructure at locations where many accidents occur. Such technologies will \nhelp to decrease fatalities and injuries among pedestrians and non-motorized transport users, \nwho tend to be predominantly from low-income groups. \n \n7.  Many developed countries have already recognized the potential of ITS to reduce road \naccidents.  The  European  Commission  deployed  the  \u201ce-Safety\u201d  program  in  2002,  the \nGovernment of the United States deployed \u201cVehicle Infrastructure Integration\u201d in 2003 and \n\u201cIntelligent  Vehicle  Initiative\u201d  in  1998,  and  the  Government  of  Japan  deployed  \u201cAdvanced \nCruise-Assist  Highway  Systems\u201d  in  1996  and  \u201cAdvanced  Safety  Vehicle\u201d  in  1991.  The \nGovernment of Japan also promotes ITS projects for commercial vehicle management. In line \nwith the actions taken by foreign governments, the Government of the PRC recognizes the \nimportance of establishing an effective ITS program for road safety, taking lessons learned from \nother countries into consideration. It is timely to study ITS policies and guidelines for road \nsafety, since the application of ITS is expanding to new areas such as commercial vehicle \nmanagement, and the price of IT continues to fall. \n \n8.  The Government has given high priority to road safety in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u2013\n2010). Consistent with the plan and aligned with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the \nPRC,6 the proposed TA will aim to assist the Government in formulating policies and guidelines \nto improve road safety through the application of ITS and recommending promising projects to \nimplement in future. \n                                                 \n5  The MOC was transformed into the Ministry of Transport (MOT) in March 2008. \n6 ADB. 2008.

The TA aims to contribute to safe and efficient road transport by introducing ITS in the \nPRC.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  include  policy  recommendations,  guidelines,  and \nrecommendations for ITS projects provided for the consideration of the national Government \nand provincial governments. The output of the TA will be a study which includes (i) policy \nrecommendations for the application of ITS, (ii) guidelines on the application of ITS, (iii) several \nrecommended ITS projects to improve road safety, and (iv) a policy note summarizing best \npractices for dissemination to high-level policy makers.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  To achieve the outputs of the TA, the consultants will (i) review literature on road safety \nand ITS in the PRC and other countries, including reviewing lessons learned from relevant \nprojects; (ii) review best practices in the application of ITS for road safety in the PRC and other \ncountries; (iii) conduct three case studies in provinces or cities in the PRC; and (iv) host \nworkshops to consult stakeholders. The case studies will be used as the basis for formulating \nITS policy recommendations and guidelines at a national level by (i) identifying major types of \naccidents and their causes in the case study areas, (ii) identifying the rationale for utilizing ITS \ncompared with other road safety measures, and (iii) proposing future ITS projects and policies \nfor the use of ITS for road safety. \n \n11.  International and national consultants will be engaged to help the Ministry of Transport \n(MOT) carry out the TA. The consultants will maintain close working relations with MOT and \nADB,  and  will  regularly  discuss  progress  and  findings.  The  TA  will  involve  (i)  fieldwork, \n(ii) gathering national and international experiences, (iii) analytical research, (iv) consultations \nwith the national Government and provincial governments responsible for road transport and \nother stakeholders, and (v) training for building the capacity of government staff. To develop \ncapacity,  the  consultants  will  identify  suitable  overseas  training  opportunities  and  arrange \noverseas training to learn from international experience and best practices of ITS road safety \nprojects. \n \n12.  With the assistance of the consultants, MOT will conduct workshops to consult with \nstakeholders  and  disseminate  the  TA  findings.  MOT  will  liaise  with  government  agencies \nconcerned and stakeholders. The workshops will be held at the inception, interim, and draft final \nreport stages. The inception and draft final report workshops will be held in Beijing, and the \nworkshops at the interim report stage will be held in each case study area. MOT will provide the \nconsultants with all relevant materials, recent studies, and reports required for conducting the \nTA. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program \n(Technical Assistance Special Fund-others) will finance the TA on a grant basis in the amount of \n$500,000. MOT will finance the remaining $125,000 equivalent, which will be used to cover \ncounterpart staff, office space, furniture, and other support services. The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n ", "4    \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOT will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for guiding and \nsupervising  the  TA  activities  and  for  coordination  with  relevant  government  agencies  and \norganizations, including provincial and city governments. MOT will (i) ensure the cooperation of \ngovernment agencies and organizations concerned, including provincial and city governments, \nin case studies; and (ii) provide guidance and assistance to consultants to implement the TA. \nMOT will assign appropriate counterpart staff to assist the consultants, and form a project \n \nsteering committee to guide and support the TA. This committee will be chaired by the deputy \ndirector general of the Comprehensive Planning Department of MOT. It will include senior \nofficials from the Comprehensive Planning Department, Highway Administration Department, \nand  relevant  officers  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  other  agencies  concerned.  Tripartite \nmeetings  involving  ADB  staff,  MOT,  and  consultants  will  be  held  to  provide  guidance  to \nconsultants and review their reports. The consultants will submit reports to ADB and MOT as \nscheduled in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). All reports by the consultants \nwill be written in English and translated into Chinese. \n \n15.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB through a national consulting firm associated \nwith an international firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time) on the basis of the quality of the proposal (90%) and the \ncost (10%) of the services to be provided using the simplified technical proposal procedures. \nThe 90:10 weighting is considered appropriate because the TA is an advanced multidisciplinary \nassignment that requires creativity and a high level of expertise in advanced technologies and \ntheir application, and the quality of the consulting services will have a significant impact on the \neffectiveness of the TA. The TA will require about 7 person-months of international and about \n30  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  to  carry  out  the  terms  of  reference \n(Appendix 3). The international consultant will have expertise and experience in the fields of \nroad  safety  and  ITS.  The  national  consultants  will  have  expertise  and  experience  in  the \nfollowing fields: (i) road safety, (ii) ITS, (iii) commercial vehicle management, and (iv) transport \nregulation  and  standards.  Disbursement  will  be  undertaken  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook.7 The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  11  months  from \nAugust 2009 to June 2010.  \n \n16.   MOT will provide a suitably furnished office with utilities and telecommunication access, \nmaterials, maps, data, and documents required by the TA; and will cover the cost of utilities for \nthe consultants, counterpart professional staff, and support staff. TA equipment will be procured \nby the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from \ntime to time) and transferred to MOT upon completion of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Improving Road Safety through the \nApplication of Intelligent Transport Systems, and hereby reports the action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2008.
