INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Review (ADR) is the research journal of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and the ADB Institute (ADBI). Since its inception in 1983, the ADR has been an \nimportant channel for disseminating rigorous research on issues concerning development of, \nand in, Asia and the Pacific. Since 2013, it has been published by the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology (MIT) Press. Strategy 2020 mandates that ADB engage in forward-looking research \nin support of knowledge creation for its developing member countries (DMCs).1 The Strategy \n2020 Midterm Review affirms this direction, stresses the importance of knowledge-related work, \nand mandates that ADB provide knowledge solutions to its DMCs. 2 \n \n2.  ADR\u2019s value added to ADB\u2019s knowledge value chain hinges on its remit as its in-house \nprofessional research journal. Having a well-positioned and reputable journal provides a signal \nto ADB\u2019s DMCs that its development strategies, policy prescriptions, and knowledge solutions \nare backed by rigorous research.  \n \n3.  The rationale for this technical assistance (TA) is that ADB needs to continue making \nefforts to position the ADR as a key venue for the publication and distribution of rigorous \nresearch on topics relevant to ADB\u2019s institutional franchise, inclusive of research on the areas of \npoverty,  social  protection  and  development,  innovation,  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth, \nimpact mitigation of climate change, and regional cooperation and integration. Disseminating \nresults of research on relevant issues and their policy implications to the research community \nand the region\u2019s policy-making circles enhances policy formulation and decision making in \nADB\u2019s DMCs.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  However, the ADR is not the preferred platform for the publication of rigorously written \nresearch papers on issues facing Asia and the Pacific, since it is not included in Thomson \nReuter\u2019s Social Science Citation Index (SSCI). Ideally, the ADR must be included in the SSCI \nfor  it  to  attract  a  large  number  of  manuscript  submissions.  Inclusion  into  the  SSCI  is \ninstrumental in improving the ADR\u2019s attractiveness as a platform for disseminating results of \nrigorous research to policy-making circles in ADB\u2019s constituency. \n \n5.  Inclusion into the SSCI requires relatively high-impact factors.4 The ADR\u2019s impact factor, \nhowever, is relatively low compared to those of other journals that provide a venue for the \npublication  of  research  results  focused  on  socioeconomic  development.  The  World  Bank \nEconomic Review and the International Monetary Fund Economic Review, for example, have \nimpact factors that are at least nine times higher than those of the ADR in 2011\u20132013. The \naverage impact factor of the journal of the African Development Bank, the African Development \nReview, during the last 3 years is twice that of the ADR\u2019s. As an instrument for communicating \nthe results of research that forms the basis of policy, the journal should at least be at par with \nthese comparator journals. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila \n3  This TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 July 2015. \n4  The impact factor is a numeric indicator of an academic publication\u2019s influence on researchers, and is driven \nprimarily by the number of citations it receives from other published academic work. Inclusion in the SSCI and high \nimpact factors are two key determinants in researchers\u2019 choice of journal for publishing research results. \n ", "2 \n6.  The criteria for inclusion into the SSCI list include having (i) an internationally diverse \nboard of editors, (ii) a record of timely and consistent releases of journal issues, (iii) an efficient \neditorial process, and (iv) acceptable results in journal citation analyses. Items (i) and (ii) were \naddressed  and  accomplished  in  2012  through  an  earlier  research  and  development  TA,5 \nresulting in a new editorial board, the institution of governance rules, the enhancement of \neditorial processes, and the engagement of MIT Press as publisher, while items (iii) and (iv) are \npending. To improve the ADR\u2019s chances of being included into the SSCI list, it is imperative that \nits number of citations per published article increase over the medium term to a level much \ncloser to those of the International Monetary Fund Economic Review and the World Bank \nEconomic Review, which are already included in the SSCI. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be to enhance development policy formulation and decision making in \nADB\u2019s  DMCs.  The  outcome  will  be  wider  dissemination  and  usage  of  rigorous  research \npublished in the ADR, especially through electronic channels. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will result in the production of four issues of the ADR, each containing six to \neight articles obtained from unsolicited submissions, ADR development conference papers, \nselected Asian Development Outlook, Key Indicators, and Asian Economic Integration Report  \nbackground papers, and ADB working papers. We expect that about half of the manuscripts will \ninitially come from three development conferences, which will be held between September 2015 \nand December 2016.6 All research articles will cover topics that are relevant for researchers and \npolicy makers in Asia and the Pacific, and will be aligned with the priority areas stipulated in \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 midterm review. The ADR issues will be distributed in printed form to \nsubscribers and partner libraries in the region, and are freely accessible and downloadable in \nelectronic format through the web.  \n \n9.  Three development conferences shall be conducted in 2015 and 2016 to ensure that \nhigh-quality papers from reputable authors are obtained for publication into the ADR. The ADR\u2019s \neditorial board shall, at the start of each year, agree on the venue and proximate dates of ADR \nconferences, in order to provide at least 8 to 12 months\u2019 lead time for the invitation of potential \nconference participants and allow paper presentors sufficient time to finalize their research and \nmanuscripts. One of the conferences will be held in ADB headquarters, while the other two will \nbe conducted in other venues within Asia. The theme of the 2015 ADR development conference \nwill  be  economic  growth  and  structural  transformation  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  For  each \ndevelopment  conference,  the  ADR  shall  engage  the  services  of  six  to  eight  international \nconsultants  to  conduct  research,  present  their  findings,  and  submit  manuscripts  for \nconsideration into the ADR.  \n \n10.  The TA will also fund the production and distribution of four issues of the journal (i.e., \nSeptember  2015,  March  2016,  September  2016,  and  March  2017),  allow  the  continued \nengagement of MIT Press as publisher to improve the ADR\u2019s visibility within the global research \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance for the Asian Development Review 2012\u20132013. Manila.  \n6   A representative from ADB\u2019s Group A or Group B member countries will attend each development conference to \nparticipate as discussant. \n ", "  3\ncommunity, and fund the engagement of guest editors to assist the editorial team in organizing \nthematic  conferences.  The  TA  will  also  support  the  continued  improvement  of  the  ADR\u2019s \neditorial  processes  in  terms  of  build-out  of  author  and  referee  databases,  automation  of \nmanuscript handling, and the institution of a web-based manuscript submission and peer review \nsystem. \n \n11.  The  TA  assumes  that  the  extent  of  dependency  on  research  papers  presented  in \ndevelopment conferences for possible publication into the ADR will tend to remain high in the \nnear future, and will continue to be a challenge prior to the inclusion of the ADR in the SSCI. \nThe ADR editorial office shall institute measures to lower the extent of its dependency on \ndevelopment conferences and gradually increase the number of unsolicited submissions over \nthe medium term.  \n \n12.  The TA also assumes that each development conference shall be attended by at least \neight academics willing to publish their research papers in the ADR. It is further assumed that \nthe average rejection and nonsubmission rate will hover around 30% of the conference papers, \nsuch that only five out of eight conference paper manuscripts will eventually be published in the \nADR.  \n \n13.  Successfully  organizing  and  holding  development  conferences  is  a  prerequisite  for \nobtaining a sufficient number of manuscripts for consideration into the ADR and to augment \nunsolicited submissions to the journal. The risk of not finding a common window of availability \nincreases with group size and with shorter lead times for conference preparation, and was a \nmajor cause of concern in the implementation of an earlier research and development TA of \nsimilar scope. This risk can be mitigated through sufficiently long preparation lead times. \n \n14.  A significantly larger nonsubmission rate on conference papers and rejection rates on all \nmanuscripts could potentially result in the number of available manuscripts falling below the \ntargeted minimum number of six articles per issue. On the upside, significantly lower rejection \nrates will provide the editorial office with an excess number of articles, which could be placed in \ninventory for publication in a succeeding issue. It could also allow the ADR editorial office to \nreduce the number of conferences if the rejection rates remain low, and consequently increase \nthe number of accepted papers in inventory for publication in the ADR. \n \n15.  Even if the nonsubmission rate of conference papers and the overall rejection rate of all \nmanuscripts fall below 50%, there is still a risk of late submission of papers beyond defined \ndeadlines and thresholds required for a timely publication of a particular issue of the ADR. The \nADR  editorial  office  shall  institute  proactive  measures  to  mitigate  potential  delays  in  the \nsubmission of manuscripts, such as instituting time-bound reportorial requirements on the status \nof  conference  papers  and  of  manuscripts  that  have  successfully  passed  the  peer  review \nprocess but are still in the final stages of copyediting. \n \n16.  These risk factors contribute to the overall risk of not having enough peer-reviewed \narticles available for publication in each of the biannual issues of the ADR. To further mitigate \nthis, the editorial office shall also examine all working papers from various departments of ADB \nand  ADBI  and  invite  selected  authors  to  submit  their  respective  working  papers  for \nconsideration into the ADR. \n \n17.  On the part of the ADR\u2019s intended readership, there is a risk that the bulk of articles \npublished in the journal do not capture the interest of researchers and policy makers. This \n\u201cmarket-related\u201d risk could be mitigated by carefully screening and selecting the research topics \n ", "4 \nand  themes  of  ADR  development  conferences.  Nevertheless,  this  risk  can  never  be  fully \nmitigated, and any lack of interest in one or several of the published articles could lead to lower \naverage citation rates for the ADR. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA project\u2019s executing agency is ADB. The Office of the Chief Economist under the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will administer and supervise the \nTA, and the editorial team composed of ADB staff shall conduct contract administration of \nindividual consultants. It will closely coordinate and work with representatives of ADBI in the \nplanning and conduct of the development conferences, including the engagement of consultants \nand resource persons, as defined in ADB\u2019s and ADBI\u2019s copublishing agreement for the ADR.   \n \n20.  The  ADR  editorial  office  will  commission  up  to  three  internationally  known  senior \nacademics with proven publication records as guest editors. Each guest editor is expected to \nhelp  organize  one  development  conference,  and  take  the  lead  in  inviting  academics  with \nestablished publication records. The guest editors will be engaged individually on a lump-sum \nbasis, and their deliverables will include the operationalization and conduct of at least one \nconference each, and ensure that at least eight researchers will respond to the editorial office\u2019s \ncall for papers. In addition, he or she will also pursue the subsequent submission of rigorously \nwritten conference paper manuscripts for consideration into the ADR. The guest editor shall also \noversee the final production and distribution of the ADR issue assigned to him or her.  \n \n21.  In case there are more than eight respondents to the call for papers in each of the \ndevelopment conferences, the editor, managing editor, and guest editor shall jointly decide \nwhich  respondents  will  be  commissioned  to  conduct  research  and  present  results  in  a \ndevelopment conference. All presentors are expected to subsequently submit manuscripts for \nconsideration into the ADR. To minimize travel-related costs, all discussants invited to the \nconference will be sourced from the pool of qualified ADB staff whose domiciles are near the \nconference venue, and from faculty of local universities with similar fields of specialization as \nthe authors. At least one government official from an upper-middle-income or lower-middle-\nincome DMC shall also be invited to each development conference as discussant. Researchers \nare expected to address comments made by fellow presentors and discussants during the \nconference  in  their  final  manuscript  submissions  to  the  ADR  editorial  office.  The  final \nmanuscripts are typically submitted to the editorial office within 60 to 90 calendar days after the \nconference.  Each  conference  is  expected  to  yield  five  to  six  peer-reviewed  articles  for \npublication into the ADR.  \n \n22.  In addition to the development conference papers, the editorial office will also leverage \nselected ADB economics and regional cooperation working papers, as well as the background \npapers for the Asian Development Outlook, Key Indicators, and Asian Economic Integration \nReport.  The  ADR  editorial  office  shall  invite  authors  of  selected  papers  to  revise  their \nmanuscripts as needed, and submit them for consideration to the ADR. These papers are \nnormally commissioned work done for the abovementioned flagship publications. The ADR \neditorial office shall only consider papers that have good potential to become journal articles, \nand  will  compensate  authors  who  will  agree  to  revise  and  submit  their  manuscripts  for \n ", "  5\nrefereeing, provided these are finally accepted for publication in the ADR, and their respective \nauthors are not restricted from receiving incremental remuneration. \n \n23.  The editorial office shall engage the services of one international consultant on lump-\nsum,  intermittent  basis  to  perform  major  structural  and  grammatical  editing  on  accepted \nmanuscripts. Another international consultant with an advanced degree in economics will be \nengaged, also on a lump-sum, intermittent basis, to conduct technical and economics editing. It \nwill also engage the services of a national consultant, likewise on lump-sum basis, to perform \ntypesetting  and  provide  production  support.  The  national  consultant  will  work  in  ADB \nheadquarters, together with the ADR\u2019s editorial team. The ADR\u2019s editorial board shall continue \nto engage the services of MIT Press as the journal\u2019s publisher, which will be responsible for the \nfinal typesetting of the entire ADR issue. It shall also be responsible for the printing, physical \ndistribution of printed copies, web publishing, and dissemination of electronic copies of the \njournal, which are downloadable free of charge from the MIT Press website and mirrored in \nADB\u2019s open access repository. As part of the publication agreement with ADB and ADBI, MIT \nPress will also allow the ADR editorial office free use of its online manuscript submission and \npeer review system, which the former shall reconfigure to align it with the ADR\u2019s editorial \nprocess. It is assumed that ADB and ADBI will continue to jointly publish the ADR beyond 2015.  \n \n24.  The expected TA completion date is 30 December 2017. \n \n25.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), and will be selected on a quality and \ncost-based selection basis. All disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n26.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Asian Development Review 2015\u20132017, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact \nThe Technical Assistance project\u2019s impact is enhanced policy formulation and policy decision-making in \nADB\u2019s DMCs.
