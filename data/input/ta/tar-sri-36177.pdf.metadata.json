During the Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \n2002, the Government of Sri Lanka (the Government) requested ADB technical assistance (TA) \nto prepare an energy sector master plan. A fact-finding mission visited Sri Lanka in January \n2003 to formulate the proposed TA project and reached an understanding with the Government \non the implementation arrangements, cost estimates, and terms of reference of consultants.1 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  During the past 2 years the Government has introduced policy decisions reforming and \nrestructuring the public utility sector by unbundling the traditional integrated utility monopolies,2 \nand by creating environments conducive for private sector participation in a number of the \nenergy subsectors. The Government is currently implementing the legal framework applicable to \nthe energy sector, moving toward its policy objective of leveling the opportunities between public \nand  private  sector  entities.  The  establishment  of  autonomous  regulatory  institutions  is  an \nintegrated part of the Government's strategy to meet the stated objective. In the Sri Lankan \ncontext, this means a multisector regulatory commission, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC). \nCurrently, the PUC covers the electricity sector, and it is envisioned to handle the water sector \nwith other utility sectors to be added in the future. \n \n3.  The proposed energy sector master plan (ESMP) will cover the power, petroleum, oil \nand  gas  exploration,  liquefied  petroleum  gas,  and  renewable  energy  subsectors.  The \nGovernment has successfully commenced reforms and restructuring activities within each of \nthese energy subsectors, but on an individual subsector basis. Sri Lanka needs to develop for \nthe energy sector, a macro-level, medium- to long-term interactive planning framework. Such a \nplan is needed for Sri Lanka to achieve an efficient and financially sustainable energy sector \nthrough the introduction of market-based incentive structures. The ESMP is to be revised and \nupdated on a regular basis (at 3 year intervals), and will continue to be a reference document \nfor the energy sector. The ESMP could be updated by PUC through an interactive approach \nwith energy sector stakeholders. \n \n4.  Environmental management in the energy sector continues to be an issue pertinent to \ncurrent and the required future facilities. Environmental aspects must be an active part of the \nmedium- and long- term energy strategy. \n \n5.  Sri Lanka recently adopted a poverty alleviation strategy that has direct impact on the \nenergy sector. The current lack of or limited energy supply to identified rural geographical areas \nneeds to be addressed. A financially sustainable energy supply mechanism is needed, with \nparticular attention to the ability to pay for the installation and monthly utilization costs. The \nESMP  will  recommend  methods  for  sustainable  financing  of  these  costs,  and  clarify  the \nGovernment policy in this regard. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 20 December 2002. \n2  The TA should be seen in the context of (i) Loan 1929/1930 approved on 31 October 2002 for $130 million (ADB. \n2002. Power Sector Development Program. Manila.) and (ii) TA 3857 approved on 15 April 2002 amounting to \n$800,000 (ADB. 2002. Restructuring the Power Sector \u2013 Phase II. Manila.). \n ", "2  \n6.  Given that Sri Lanka is importing all thermal based energy resources and given the rapid \ndevelopment of the energy sector in South Asia, opportunities available to Sri Lanka should be \nreviewed in terms of regional energy sector cooperation. Exploring the possibilities of regional \nenergy sector cooperation could identify financially and economically preferable  solutions of \nmeeting energy demand in Sri Lanka. \n \n7.  Other funding agencies have also been active in promoting energy sector reforms and \nrestructuring. These organizations welcome ADB\u2019s timely assistance to the Government and \nsupport the establishment of the ESMP. Further interaction with these organizations, to benefit \nfrom  a  wider  network  of  experience,  will  take  place  during  the  TA  implementation.  The \nenvisioned  assistance  from  other  agencies  is  either  project-specific  or  linked  to  the \nimplementation of  the regulatory functions. No studies aiming at the overall energy sector \nenvironment are being pursued by other institutions. The TA is also in line with ADB's country \nstrategy and program for Sri Lanka, which seeks to support sustainable growth by reforming \npublic utilities and restructuring the state-owned enterprises. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to assist the Government to formulate a strategy (the ESMP) to \ndevelop a sustainable energy sector. This strategy will improve the policy and regulatory \nframework, and promote sector restructuring with a view to increase energy sector efficiency, \nenergy sector investments, private sector participation, and to ensure that energy supply is \nexpanded to remote areas in a sustainable manner. The TA framework is attached as Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will prepare a strategy for the energy sector with a time horizon from 2004 and \n20 years into the future, with particular emphasis on the (i) 3\u20135 year, and (ii) 5\u201310 year \nhorizons. The strategy will be developed based on an assessment of (i) Sri Lanka\u2019s energy \nresources; (ii) energy sector studies financed by other institutions; (iii) energy sector policies, \ninstitutional frameworks, and regulations; and (iv) existing Government strategies, programs, \nand plans. In addition to recommendations on traditional energy sector aspects, the TA will \nrecommend measures aimed at providing adequate energy to the poor and disadvantaged, \nincluding people in remote regions currently not covered by the power grid, in an efficient \nmanner. The TA will establish a broad framework to (i) assess the scope to improve the energy \nsupply system\u2019s reliability and efficiency, (ii) determine the priorities for its rehabilitation and \nmaintenance, (iii) determine optimal alternatives of renewable energy development, and (iv) \nensure  proper  environmental  considerations  during  TA  development,  implementation,  and \noperations. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are shown in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  The  TA  will  identify  barriers  to  market-oriented  energy  sector  development  and \nrecommend measures to help achieve sustainable environmental improvement. The ESMP will \nalso  outline  prioritized  investments  required  for  rehabilitating  and  restructuring the energy \nsector, and a renewable energy development program for support by external funding agencies, ", "  3\nincluding ADB. A medium- and long-term strategy for implementing the Government\u2019s energy \nsector  development  program  will  be  formulated  in  accordance  with  market-oriented  policy \nrequirements and project viability. The ESMP will formulate an action program for further policy \nand institutional reforms in the energy sector, including measures for (i) creating a modern \nenergy  delivery  system  by  increasing  the  efficiency  of  energy  use  and  demand-side \nmanagement, and (ii) removing energy sector bottlenecks.  Environmentally sustainable energy \nexpansion will be promoted by replacing fossil fuels with cleaner energy sources to reduce air \npollution, with a special emphasis on investigating climate change issues. A financing strategy \nwill be prepared including domestic resource mobilization through tariff reforms to recover costs. \nThe  ESMP  will  outline  measures  for  improving  governance  and  enhancing  private  sector \nparticipation in the energy sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent, comprising about $410,000 \nin foreign exchange and $240,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The cost estimates are \npresented in Appendix 3. ADB will provide $500,000, comprising $410,000 in foreign exchange \ncosts and $90,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program.  The Government will finance the remaining $150,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency costs. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) will be the Executing Agency of the TA. A \nsteering committee will be established to coordinate with all the involved Government agencies. \nThe steering committee will be headed by the secretary, MOPE, and he will assign a TA \ndirector, who will be responsible for coordinating between the consultants and the steering \ncommittee. MOPE will coordinate with the Ministry for Policy Development and Implementation \nand with PUC (a multisector regulator).  Active participation by these agencies will be sought at \nthe time of the workshops to be conducted under the TA. \n \n13.  The TA is expected to commence in August 2003, and be carried out over 9 months by \nan internationally recognized consulting firm in association with domestic consultants. The TA is \nto be completed in April 2004. The total input of international and domestic consultant services \nwill be about 14 and 20 person-months, respectively. The consultants will be expected to have \ndemonstrated  experience  in  overall  energy  sector  planning  and  in  the  individual  energy \nsubsectors. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services is presented in Appendix \n2. ADB will use simplified technical proposals and quality- and cost-based selection methods for \nconsultant selection.  Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will prepare and submit to ADB: (i) inception report, within 4 weeks \nof commencement of assignment, (ii) interim reports, within 1 week of the scheduled workshops \nand inclusive of the presentation material delivered at the workshop; (iii) draft final report, after 8 \nmonths  of  commencement  of  assignment;  and  (iv)  final  report,  after  9  months  of \ncommencement of assignment. \n \n ", "4  \nIV.
