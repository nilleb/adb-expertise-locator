The long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \n(Strategy 2020) highlights the need for ADB to promote partnerships and knowledge solutions \nas drivers of change for its new development agenda.1 Strategy 2020 has adopted a vision of \nAsia and the Pacific free of poverty. This is to be achieved by making growth and social \ndevelopment  more  inclusive,  and  through  emphasis  on  environmental  sustainability  and \nregional cooperation. It sees ADB as playing a much bigger role in knowledge development, \nexchanges,  and  partnerships.  The  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance            \n(R-CDTA) will facilitate the development and exchange of new knowledge on poverty and \ninclusive growth between leading knowledge institutions and policy makers in Asia, through \ncapacity-building support and the use of modern communication and technology solutions.2 It \nwill establish a regional knowledge forum that exchanges knowledge through an Asia-wide \npoverty and inclusive growth website, and will partner with other international agencies for this \npurpose.3  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Remaining and New Challenges in Reducing Poverty. Asia and the Pacific is known \nfor  its  success  in  the  last  decade  in  reducing  income  poverty  and  enhancing  social \ndevelopment. However, new poverty estimates indicate that the incidence and magnitude of \npoverty is larger than previous estimates, and that poverty reduction may not be as successful \nas  formerly  considered.4 Major  challenges  remain,  therefore,  and  new  ones  are  arising \nparticularly with regard to (i) non-income dimensions of poverty and the achievement of the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); (ii) aggravation of poverty caused by environmental \nfactors and climate change; (iii) challenges in providing effective social protection, including \nissues related to demographic change, aging, and migration; and (iv) recent reversals of poverty \nreduction caused by food price increases. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n2  The  R-CDTA  concept  was  approved  by  the  Vice-President,  Knowledge  Management  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment on 6 March 2007. Funding from the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund was \nendorsed on 4 October 2007. Additional funding from the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) Regional Cooperation \nand Poverty Reduction Fund was approved on 24 June 2008. The R-CDTA was first listed in the business \nopportunities section of the ADB website on 10 July 2008. \n3  The R-CDTA will support, among others, the work of the ADB\u2013United Nations Economic and Social Commission \nfor Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)\u2013United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) partnership to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs); and regional discussion on poverty and inclusive growth in the context of \nASEAN+3.  It  will  also  link  with  the  Global  Development  Network  and  other  internet-based  and  electronic \nknowledge-sharing institutions and tools. The approach taken in this R-CDTA differs from such networks by \nfocusing on poverty (not broader development) issues in Asia only; and by institutionalizing knowledge exchanges \nbetween leading regional and national knowledge centers on poverty reduction (these centers will be close to the \ngovernment, rather than being individual researchers).  \n4  See various ADB work on inclusive growth and on inequality, such as: Walton, Michael. 2007. Poverty Reduction in \nthe New Asia and Pacific: Key Challenges of Inclusive Growth for the Asian Development Bank. Manila: ADB; Ali, \nIfzal and Zhuang, Juzhong. 2007.

Washington, DC: World Bank (Policy \nResearch Paper). \n \n ", "2   \n3.    Weaknesses  in  Knowledge  Sharing.  Asian  experiences  in  poverty  reduction  are \ndiverse, and countries are increasingly interested in learning from each other and sharing their \nexperiences. However, a number of factors are hampering efficient exchange of knowledge. \nFirst, there are insufficient knowledge products in an appropriate form for facilitating knowledge \nexchanges. While much data and research on successful experiences and good practices exist, \nincluding from ADB\u2019s own operational experience, they are not available in an easily shareable \nform (i.e., synthesized, succinct, and high-quality form; and in common [English] language) for \nusage beyond academic circles and across borders. As a result, such knowledge is often not \nsufficiently  replicated  (with  suitable  local  adaptations),  or  upgraded.  Secondly,  while  many \ncountries  have  leading  knowledge  and  policy  research  institutions,  their  research  is  often \ndisseminated in a limited manner with insufficient influence in international policy discussions. \nEncouraging them to develop appropriate shareable knowledge products and bringing them \ntogether in knowledge exchange networks will boost knowledge sharing in the region. Finally, \nknowledge exchange modalities (especially across borders) are weak and sporadic, and are not \nbeing conducted systematically. ADB is in a unique position, with membership embracing all \nthese countries, to facilitate such exchanges. Regional groupings, such as the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, can \nalso play an important role in sharing information for policy implementation.  \n4.    Inadequate Use of Information and Communication Technology within Knowledge \nNetworks.  To  share  both  regional  and  local  knowledge  widely,  quickly,  efficiently,  and \ninexpensively, the R-CDTA will promote the use of modern electronic networks and information \nand communication technology (ICT) such as websites, e-newsletters, teleconferencing, and \nvideoconferencing.  This  will  address  some  lessons  from  past  ADB  support  to  knowledge \nnetworks,  which  was  less  sustainable  beyond  the  financing  of  studies  and  conferences. \nMaximizing use of ICT for networking purposes is also environment-friendly as it will reduce \nconferences and air travel to the minimum.   \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.    The Project is expected to improve\u2014through knowledge sharing\u2014strategic thinking on \npoverty reduction and inclusive growth. It will generate and share\u2014in a regional context\u2014\nknowledge products in these areas. Through its regional website, it will institutionalize a regional \nknowledge network on poverty reduction for Asia and the Pacific.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Components \na.  Developing Knowledge Products  \n6.    Support will be provided to (i) help national think tank institutions in the region develop \nknowledge products related to poverty and inclusive growth, and synthesize such products for \nsharing; and (ii) develop and share knowledge products from ADB\u2019s own experience. \n7.    Knowledge Products of Regional Knowledge Institutions. The R-CDTA will help \nsynthesize knowledge on new poverty reduction and inclusive growth issues in Asia and the \nPacific, and make such knowledge more easily accessible to domestic and regional experts and \npolicy  makers.  To  this  end,  it  will  finance\u2014through  the  selected  regional  knowledge \ninstitutions\u2014about 34 policy briefs and working papers and a number of studies on issues of \nregional interest. In addition, it is expected that the participating research institutions will share \nabout 70 knowledge papers from their own work, and place them on their websites within the R-\n ", "  3\nCDTA implementation period. The R-CDTA will not finance new original research;5 rather, it will \nsummarize and share\u2014through a regional website\u2014existing national knowledge. A tentative list \nof topics that have been initially considered is in Appendix 3. The topics of working papers and \npolicy briefs, and the contribution of individual countries, will be mutually agreed upon at the \nbeginning of R-CDTA implementation by the four participating subregional network partners and \nADB staff.  \n8.    Knowledge  Products  of  ADB.  The  R-CDTA  will  also  support  the  preparation  of \nknowledge products based on ADB\u2019s experience to enable it to share its own operational \nexperiences  on  poverty  and  inclusive  growth  more  effectively.  This  will  be  achieved  by \nsupporting preparation of eight policy briefs and seven working papers, and publishing them \nthrough an e-newsletter on poverty and inclusive growth.6   \nb.  Facilitating Knowledge Networks \n9.    The R-CDTA will build capacities in the selected knowledge institutions to improve and \nmaintain their own websites better as an effective means to share relevant knowledge on \npoverty reduction and inclusive growth. These websites will then be linked to the relevant \nwebsites  of  participating  national  think  tank  institutions  by  establishing  similar  content \nstructures. In addition, the national websites will be linked to each other, thereby establishing a \nregional  website  on  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  The \nInternational Poverty Reduction Center in China (IPRCC) 7 will serve as a hub for poverty \nnetworks in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and coordinate subregional activities with \npoverty  networks  in  Central  Asia.  The  National  Council  of  Applied  Economic  Research \n(NCAER) will serve as a hub for the poverty networks in India, and coordinate subregional \nactivities with poverty networks in South Asia. The Korean Development Institute (KDI) will \ncoordinate work in the Republic of Korea, and the Philippine Institute for Development Studies \n(PIDS) will coordinate subregional activities with poverty networks in Southeast Asia and the \nPacific.  The  regional  network  will  also  be  linked  to  the  poverty  and  MDG  websites  of \ninternational institutions such as ADB, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for \nAsia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nalready established under the regional partnership on MDGs;8 and to other relevant sections of \ninternational websites and electronic newsletters as needed.9 Overall, the R-CDTA will partner \n                                                 \n5  For example, ADB finances studies under the regional technical assistance for \u201cSupporting Strategic Knowledge \nProducts and Research Networking\u201d for PRC and Mongolia and \u201cPromoting and Sustaining Inclusive Economic \nGrowth in India and PRC\u201d. \n6  The e-newsletter will broaden work initiated under the Poverty Matters newsletter financed jointly by the National \nPoverty Reduction Strategies fund (supported by the Government of the Netherlands) and the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund (financed by the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom). Poverty \nMatters shared experiences from projects financed under the Dutch and UK poverty trust funds with ADB with a \nwide audience. The trust funds have been closed and the newsletter stopped. The proposed R-CDTA will help \ncontinue  the  dissemination  of  poverty  and  inclusive  growth  knowledge  for  all  ADB  operations  through  the \nnewsletter. \n7  IPRCC was established by the Government of the PRC in 2004 as an Asian platform for exchange of regional \nknowledge on poverty reduction, and to promote learning from the PRC\u2019s poverty reduction successes. It has \nconducted a series of international training courses and high-level conferences, including cooperating with ADB \nunder the Second ASEAN+3 Poverty Reduction Seminar in September 2006. IPRCC is also the secretariat of the \nPADI initiative. IPRCC has requested ADB support to strengthen its interaction with other poverty research \ninstitutions in the region. The R-CDTA will build capacities in IPRCC for strengthening its role as an Asia-wide \ninternational institution and as secretariat for PADI.  \n8  Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific. http://www.mdgasiapacific.org/. \n9  Including ADB, World Bank, UNESCAP and UNDP poverty websites, Global Development Network, Development \nGateway, id21News, Development Assistance Committee (DAC) Network on Poverty Reduction (POVNET), \n ", "4   \nfinally  with  about  50 national  and  regional  knowledge  institutions,  government  agencies, \nregional associations, and development institutions. The regional website network will thus be a \nunique knowledge database on all poverty reduction strategic approaches, sector and thematic \nthinking, country programs and experiences, analytical tools, and knowledge exchange in Asia \nand the Pacific. \n10.   Furthermore,  the  R-CDTA  will  facilitate  regional  exchanges  through  two  regional \nconferences  (both  supported  under  this  R-CDTA)  and  three  policy  seminars;  it  intends  to \nconduct much of such exchanges through videoconferencing, for which some limited support \nwill be provided to the institutions. Such regional exchanges will include the participation of \nregional  groupings  such  as  ASEAN;10 and  linkages  with  the  new  Poverty  Analysis  and \nDevelopment Initiative (PADI),11 and the MDG partnership of ADB with UNESCAP and UNDP.12  \n11.   With  parallel  financing  from  the  ASEAN  Foundation,  through  the  Asian  Institute  of \nManagement (AIM), the R-CDTA will also facilitate specific capacity building for governments on \nthe opportunities of closer private sector involvement in poverty reduction. \n2.  Sustainability  \n12.   Regional  knowledge  exchange  requires  up-front  development  of  capacities,  e.g.,  in \nestablishing shared information through websites and e-newsletters and in building up networks. \nThe  R-CDTA  will  provide  initial  support  for  development  of  knowledge  products  and  for \nnetworking. Once such networks are established, such built-up capacity will be maintained by \nthe participating institutions over time, with a much smaller role (such as supporting workshops \nand  help  populating  the  regional  website)  correspondingly  for  ADB.  The  R-CDTA  will  be \nimplemented in two phases. Initially, it will support knowledge institutions in PRC, India, and the \nRepublic of Korea to develop knowledge products; and strengthen their capacities to undertake \nknowledge exchanges facilitated by the use of ICT and improved websites. In the second \nphase, it will bring in other subregional knowledge institutions in Asia and the Pacific within the \nknowledge network.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.   The R-CDTA, estimated to cost $1,000,000, will be jointly financed on a grant basis by \nthe Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund, both administered by ADB.13 In \n                                                                                                                                                          \nPoverty and Economic Policy Research Network, and selected other poverty centers outside Asia and the Pacific, \nespecially in Africa and Latin America.  \n10  One policy seminar, cosponsored by the ASEAN Foundation, will specifically focus on the role of regional \ninstitutions for poverty reduction in Southeast Asia.  \n11 PADI is a regional forum established by the World Bank Institute in 2001 for sharing poverty data, poverty \nresearch, and poverty policy in East Asia. IPRCC is currently the secretariat of the PADI knowledge network. The \ninstitution is currently being reformed to serve as a regional network on poverty analysis, policy influencing, \nknowledge sharing and data and indicators exchange. PADI is currently being transformed from a Poverty and \nData Initiative to a Poverty Analysis and Development Initiative, with stronger country ownership and focus on \ncapacity building for three pillars, i.e. poverty data and indicators; policy influencing; and poverty research.  \n12  ADB. ADB\u2019s Partnership with UNESCAP and UNDP on Regional MDG Project. \nhttp://www.adb.org/Poverty/mdgs/adb-escap-undp-partnership.asp \n13 Funding of $500,000 was approved by the Government of the Republic of Korea on 4 October 2007. An additional \n$500,000 was approved by the Government of the PRC on 24 June 2008. Both governments confirmed jointly \nfinancing the technical assistance through one project. \n ", "  5\naddition, the ASEAN Foundation will provide parallel cofinancing for capacity building and policy \nrecommendation for Southeast Asia. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.14 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   Executing and Implementing Agencies. ADB, through the Poverty Unit in the Regional \nand Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) will be the Executing Agency; and will be \nresponsible for overall management and coordination, including monitoring the agreements with \nthe participating institutions and timely completion of outputs and activities. IPRCC, NCAER, \nKDI, and PIDS will be the coordinating implementing agencies. They will work with other leading \nnational  think  tank  and  government  institutions  as  well  as  subregional  bodies  and \norganizations.15 ADB will set up an internal peer review group and involve its poverty network to \nadvise on the R-CDTA from the perspectives of regional and other knowledge departments. \n15.   Expanding Networking through Phased Approach. The R-CDTA will adopt a phased \napproach to expanding the network. In the first year, it will work\u2014through IPRCC, KDI and \nNCAER \u2014with national research institutions in PRC, India, and the Republic of Korea. In the \nsecond and third years, the coverage of the network will gradually be increased after lessons \nfrom the first phase are internalized. In the second phase, it is envisaged that (i) IPRCC will also \ncover knowledge networks in Central Asia; (ii) NCAER will cover poverty knowledge networks in \nSouth Asia; and (iii) PIDS, to be included in the second phase, will coordinate knowledge \nexchange in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. The ASEAN Foundation has also provided parallel \nfinancing to this R-CDTA to support PIDS and AIM in activities for Southeast Asia. AIM and \nPIDS will facilitate capacity building for senior government officials involved in poverty reduction, \non  private  sector  and  civil  society  involvement  in  poverty  reduction;  and  prepare  specific \nrecommendations for ASEAN\u2019s role in regional poverty reduction. Appendix 3 gives an overview \nof likely participating agencies. \n16.   Consultants and Other Input Requirements. The R-CDTA will require an estimated \n53 person-months of international and 146 person-months of national consulting services to \nhelp develop capacity in the knowledge institutions. All consultants will be engaged on an \nindividual basis and not through a firm. The national and international consultants financed by \nADB under this R-CDTA will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The  research  networks  (IPRCC,  KDI, \nNCAER, and PIDS) will engage national consultants from different countries under their own \ninstitutional  arrangements  in  accordance  with  the  above-mentioned  ADB  guidelines.  The \nconsultants  supporting  development  of  knowledge  products  will  be  economists  with \nspecialization in development economics who have worked in areas of poverty reduction and \ninclusive growth and sustainable development. Consultants needed for website development \nand management will have expertise in knowledge management, website coordination and \nmanagement, web writing, and summarizing strategic policy briefs in poverty reduction. The \noutline terms of reference of the consultants and participating institutions are in Appendix 4.16 \n17.   Time  Frame.  The  R-CDTA  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  (November  2008\u2013\nDecember 2011). Cooperation on subregional knowledge hubs for Central Asia, South Asia, \nand  Southeast  Asia  will  commence  after  15  months  of  R-CDTA  implementation.  The \ninternational poverty and inclusive growth website is expected to be online by May 2009 and \nupdated on a monthly basis. The electronic newsletters (including that focusing on ADB work) \nwill appear bimonthly starting in the first quarter of 2009. Series of research report summaries \n                                                 \n14  Detailed cost estimates by participating institution and by outputs are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n15  A tentative list of participating organizations is in a Supplementary Appendix B. \n16  Detailed terms of reference for contracting the partner institutions are in Supplementary Appendix C. \n ", "6   \non selected topics will be shared in two conferences. In addition, the R-CDTA will facilitate \nparticipation in selected regional seminars and virtual exchange through video conferences.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n18.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund; and (ii) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund for Regional Knowledge and Partnership Networks for Poverty Reduction and Inclusive \nGrowth, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "  Appendix 1  7\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets   Data Sources  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  and/or Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \nImprove strategic thinking on  Countries in the region  Feedback  - Assumption: Openness \nthe new poverty reduction and  adopt from other countries  obtained from  and commitment to \ninclusive growth agenda in an  learning experiences and  partner institutions  regional learning and \nincreasingly regionalizing and  programs on poverty  and regional  knowledge exchanges \nglobal Asia  reduction and inclusive  departments in  - Risk: Poverty reduction \n  growth   ADB after  agenda is not hijacked by \ncompletion of first  other development \nand second  priorities such as climate \nphases    change \nOutcomes  - Subject knowledge  - Feedback  Assumptions:  \nImproved national capabilities  products brought to the  obtained from  - Participating institutions \nto generate and share\u2014in a  attention of policy  partner  maintain commitment to \nregional context\u2014knowledge  makers  institutions and  support process \nproducts on poverty reduction  - National think tank  the ADB internal  - ASEAN and other relevant \nand inclusive growth.   networks share joint  peer review  regional institutions are \n  strategic knowledge  group after  open to discuss poverty \nIn addition, through its regional  products with their  completion of  reduction and inclusive \nwebsite, a regional knowledge  respective governments  first and second  growth at their meetings \nnetwork on poverty reduction  - ADB\u2019s poverty and  phases  (or side events) \nand inclusive growth will be  inclusive growth work is   \ninstitutionalized   discussed and used \nmore widely in Asia.  \nOutputs     \n \n1.
