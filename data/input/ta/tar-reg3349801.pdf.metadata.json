INTRODUCTION\n1. Poverty is a growing problem in some Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs).1\nThe poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) acknowledges  that,\nalthough PDMCs are generally categorized as middle-income developing economies, their living\nstandards are vulnerable to economic and environmental shocks.2 The strategy also introduced\ncountry-specific poverty analyses, to be developed through a participatory and consultative\nprocess.  For  the  PDMCs,  an  examination  of  the  nature,  causes,  and  consequences  of\nvulnerability is an essential element of the poverty analyses, which constitute the bases for\ndevelopment of country poverty reduction strategies. The analyses encompass the nature,\nintensity, and spread of poverty; the distributional effects of macroeconomic policies; the focus\nand  efficiency of public  expenditures;  and  the  effectiveness  of  government  programs  and\ninstitutions.3\n2. The poverty reduction strategy paper observes that \u201cWith Pacific island members, ADB\nwill take the lead in capacity building for poverty analysis.\u201d closely integrating its efforts with\nthose of governments and other development agencies.4 The regional technical assistance\n(RETA) seeks to assist PDMC governments poverty analyses or assessments. The proposal\nwas endorsed by the RETA Screening Committee on 3 December 1999.5\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Until recently, poverty had not been regarded as a significant problem among PDMCs,\nwhich have high per capita incomes by developing country standards and relatively productive\nsubsistence sectors. Such cases of need as did exist were thought to be taken care of by the\nredistributive mechanisms of kinship networks. However, after two decades of generally poor\neconomic performance among PDMCs, fairly rapid population growth and urban drift, rising\nexpectations, and growing inequalities, poverty is a significant and growing problem in some\ncountries.  Traditional  support  mechanisms  are  under  strain  and,  in  some  instances,  are\nbreaking down.\n4. The 1996 Fiji Poverty Report established a country-specific poverty line of $57.53 per\nweek for an average household (1991 prices), and reached the following conclusions:\n(i)  The proportion of households in poverty had risen from 15 percent in 1977 to 25\npercent in 1990. The rise in urban poverty was especially marked.\n(ii)  A further 20 percent of households were in constant danger of becoming poor as\na result of accident or misfortune.\n                                               \n1  See section II.\n2 Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank,\nDocument R179-99, 19 October 1999, paragraph 2.\n3 Ibid., paragraph 37.\n4 Ibid.,  paragraphs 40, 78. Substantial work on poverty and sustainable livelihoods has been, and is, undertaken by\nthe United Nations Development Programme.\n5  The proposed RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2000 (Internet edition).", "2\n(iii)  The poorest 20 percent of households accounted for just over 5  percent of\nincome,  while  the  richest  20  percent  accounted  for  50  percent  of  income\n(compared with India\u2019s figures of 8.5 percent and 42.6 percent , respectively).\n(iv)  The Gini coefficient for household income was 0.461 (compared with 0.34 for\nIndia, 0.42 for the People\u2019s Republic of China, and 0.63 for Brazil), and ranged\nfrom 0.378 in rural areas to 0.507 in urban areas.\n5. A World Bank report on Papua New Guinea (PNG) based on a 1996 household survey\nconcluded that\n(i)  approximately 37 percent of the population lived below a poverty line of  $350 per\nyear (1996 prices).\n(ii)  31 percent of the population lived below the poverty line of $1 per capita per day\n(1985 purchasing power parity prices): this was high compared with countries of\nsimilar income levels;\n(iii)  93 percent of the poor lived in rural areas, where 41 percent were below the\n$350 per annum poverty line; and\n(iv)  The Gini coefficient of household expenditure (0.46) was high compared with\ncountries of similar income levels.6\n6. Fiji and PNG are the only two PDMCs for which country-specific poverty lines have been\nestablished and the extent and severity of poverty documented (although in the Fiji case data\nare relatively old being based on household surveys conducted in 1990-1991). In both cases,\nsignificant percentages  of  the population  are  worse  off than average  income  levels  might\nsuggest. Two other lower middle-income Melanesian countries where this is likely to be true are\nSolomon Islands and Vanuatu. Like PNG, they rank in the low human development category.7\nThey also score poorly on the United Nations Development Programme\u2019s (UNDP\u2019s) Gender-\nrelated Development Index, and rank high on the Human Poverty Index compared with 72 other\ndeveloping countries.8\n7. PDMCs other than PNG, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu exhibit, to varying degrees,\nhigher levels of human development and lower levels of human poverty. The table  summarizes\nthe data. Nonetheless, in all cases, poverty profiling is needed to establish the real nature and\nextent of poverty.\n8. In addition, PDMCs are especially vulnerable to external economic shocks and natural\ndisasters; and poverty and vulnerability are linked because the latter threatens the sustainability\nof livelihoods. A composite vulnerability index has been calculated and is a weighted aggregate\n                                               \n6  World Bank, Papua New Guinea: Poverty and Access to Public Services, Report No. 19584-PNG, October 1999.\n7  UNDP\u2019s Human Development Report 1998 ranks Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Papua New Guinea as 123rd,\n124th, and 129th, respectively in a list of 174 developed and developing countries.\n8  UNDP, Pacific Human Development Report 1999: Creating Opportunities, Suva, Fiji, 1999. The Human Poverty\nIndex is a composite of the percentage of people not expected to survive to age 40, the percentage of adults who\nare illiterate, the percentage of underweight children, and the percentages of people without access to safe water\nand health services. Using this index, Papua New Guinea (52.2), Solomon Islands (49.1), and Vanuatu (46.4) can\nbe grouped with such countries as Bangladesh, Ivory Coast, Mali, and Mozambique.", "3\nof openness as measured by export dependence, economic diversification as measured by the\ndiversification index of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),\nand susceptibility to natural disasters as measured by the proportion of population affected by\ndisasters during 1970-1996. Among 111 developing countries, the PDMCs that were included\nranked as follows: Vanuatu 1st (and most vulnerable); Tonga 3rd; Fiji 8th; Solomon Islands 11th;\nSamoa 20th; PNG 30th; and Kiribati 59th.9 Further work is needed to update and extend the\ncountry coverage of vulnerability indixes, prior to an analysis of the implications of vulnerability\nfor formulation of poverty  reduction  strategies.  Such  analysis  would  have  to  consider  the\nprobability of disasters occurring, and the associated expected economic losses.\nPDMCs\u2019 Human Development and Human Poverty Indices\nCountry Human Development Index Human Poverty Index\nCook Islands 0.822 6.1\nFiji Islands 0.667 8.5\nNauru 0.663 12.1\nTonga 0.647 5.9\nSamoa 0.590 8.6\nTuvalu 0.583 7.3\nFed.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The objectives of the RETA are (i) to prepare poverty assessments for each of the 12\nPDMCs, using existing data, and consulting with government,  the private  sector,  and  civil\nsociety; and (ii) to assist the governments of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in their efforts to\ngenerate and analyze data for poverty profiling. Achievement of these objectives will provide a\nfoundation  for  ADB\u2019s  dialogue  with  PDMC  governments  on  the  development  of  poverty\nreduction strategies, and for the effective monitoring of the implementation of such strategies.\nB.  Scope\n10. The scope of the poverty assessments will vary across the PDMCs according to country\nsocioeconomic circumstances, data availability, and the extent to which poverty is perceived to\nbe an issue. However, all assessments will include the following components:\n                                               \n9 Joint Commonwealth Secretariat/World Bank Task Force, Conference on the Small States, St Lucia, West Indies,\nFebruary 17-19,1999, Small States: A Composite Vulnerability Index.", "4\n(i)  a poverty profile (with rural-urban breakdowns where possible) with economic\nindicators (including income per capita, labor market data, vulnerability index);\nsocial indicators (life expectancy, child and maternal mortality, and male and\nfemale  literacy);  demographic  indicators  (fertility,  contraceptive  prevalence,\nurbanization); environmental vulnerability indicators; measures of inequality; and\navailable data on the poor \u2014 who they are (gender, age, and ethnic group); how\nnumerous they are; where and how they live; what assets they own or can\naccess; what economic and environmental risks they confront; and what basic\nservices they can access;\n(ii)  an analysis of the causes of poverty;\n(iii)  an analysis of the effectiveness of government\u2019s role in promoting  pro-poor,\nsustainable economic growth;\n(iv)  an analysis of the distributional impacts of macroeconomic policy;\n(v)  an analysis of the efficiency and effectiveness of government\u2019s efforts to improve\nthe access of the poor to basic services (including health, education, utilities, and\ntransport), and of the  role  of  non-government  organizations  and  the  private\nsector as service providers;\n(vi)  an  examination  of  the  affordability  and  effectiveness  of  social  safety  nets\navailable to protect the poor and vulnerable; and\n(vii)  preliminary recommendations of prioritized and feasible government actions to\nreduce poverty through economic management, access to basic services, and\nprovision of safety nets.\n11. In the Melanesian group of PDMCs, there already is evidence of significant poverty in\nthe cases of Fiji and (especially) PNG; and there is a prima facie case for its existence in the\ncases of Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. In the latter two cases, the scope of the RETA will\nextend to the identification  of  appropriate poverty  indicators and  the  improvement of data\navailability through sample survey and participatory methods, with an associated strengthening\nof domestic capacities for data collection and analysis. Assistance can be provided for the\ndesign  and  implementation  of  household  income  and  expenditure  surveys  that  could  be\nconducted at regular intervals.10 These surveys would provide a basis for establishing poverty\nlines; for calculating the extent, depth, and severity of poverty; and, if conducted at regular\nintervals, for monitoring progress in poverty reduction and evaluating the impact of policies,\nprograms, and projects on the lives of the poor.\n12. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed\nby ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded  TA  Program.  Detailed  cost  estimates  are\npresented in Appendix 2.\n                                               \n10  This provision is expected to apply to Solomon Islands, whereas in Vanuatu assistance is needed for analysis of\ndata generated by a 1998 household income and expenditure survey.", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n14. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA, which will involve eight person-months\nof international consulting services. A poverty assessment expert will be recruited for 6 person-\nmonths, and an economic statistician will be recruited for 2 person-months, in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the\nengagement of domestic consultants. Detailed terms of reference are presented in Appendix 3.\nIn addition, a domestic consultant will be engaged to work at ADB headquarters for eight\nperson-months  as an  administrative/research assistant  and  will  prepare  quarterly  progress\nreports for  management,  and  a  final  report  upon  completion  of  the  RETA.  The  RETA  is\nexpected to commence in June 2000 and to be completed by January 2001.\n15. The consultants will liaise closely with country desk officers in the Office of Pacific\nOperations throughout the period of the RETA, in order to ensure that poverty assessments are\nlinked  effectively  to  the formulation of  country poverty  reduction  strategies.  Comments  on\npoverty assessments completed under the RETA will also be sought from relevant divisions of\nADB,  including  the  Poverty  Reduction  Unit,  and  from  other  external  agencies  conducting\npoverty assessments in PDMCs. Close coordination with UNDP and the World Bank will ensure\nthat duplication of work is avoided.\n16. Computing equipment and software required under the RETA will be procured in Manila\nwith assistance from ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and Technology. Acting on advice\nfrom the consultants, ADB\u2019s Office of Pacific Operations will be responsible for organizing and\nmanaging in-country training workshops, seminars, and conferences funded by the RETA.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$400,000 for the purpose of Poverty Assessment in Pacific Developing Member Countries, and\nhereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Targets Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal: Development of Pacific Drafting of poverty ADB staff Poverty is a significant\nDeveloping Member Countries reduction strategies by problem\n(PDMCs) poverty reduction strategies mid 2001 Governments committed to\nand associated ADB assistance poverty reduction\nstrategies\nObjectives: (i) to prepare poverty Preparation by January ADB staff Effective consultative and\nassessments for each of the 12 2001, and subsequent participative process\nPDMCs, using existing data, and publication of, poverty\nconsulting with government, the assessments Availability of appropriately\nprivate sector, and civil society; (ii) to Improved domestic qualified counterpart staff for\nassist the governments of Solomon capacity for data the required period\nIslands and Vanuatu in their efforts to collection and analysis\ngenerate and analyze data for poverty\nprofiling.\nOutputs: (i) country poverty profiles; Formulation of a ADB staff Timetable for preparation\n(ii) analyses of the effectiveness of timetable for production adhered to, with TA\ngovernment\u2019s role in promoting pro- of profiles, analyses, personnel encountering no\npoor, sustainable economic growth; and recommendations disruptions to work programs\n(iii) analyses of the efficiency and\neffectiveness of government efforts to\nimprove the health and education of\nthe poor; (iv) examinations of the\naffordability and effectiveness of\nsocial safety nets available to protect\nthe poor and vulnerable; and (v)\npreliminary recommendations of\nprioritized and feasible government\nactions to reduce poverty.\nActivities: Technical assistance (TA) Qualified TA personnel ADB staff Appropriate TA personnel\npersonnel to undertake work as recruited and in place available for required period\nspecified in Terms of Reference. as scheduled\nCounterpart staff available\n(Reference in text, page 4, para. 12)", "7\nAppendix 2, page 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nItem Foreign Total\nExchange Cost\n1.
