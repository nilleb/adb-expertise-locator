A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to finalize due diligence on \ntechnical and safeguard aspects of the project and to provide procurement-related support to \nthe  executing  agency.  A  feasibility  study  for  the  pilot  was  prepared  under  TA  8407-INO: \nPlanning a Pilot Carbon Capture and Storage Activity, which includes a detailed technical \nanalysis  and  site  suitability  assessment,  cost  estimates  and  financial  analysis,  and  a  risk \nanalysis. A draft initial environmental examination was also prepared in conjunction with the \ndevelopment of the feasibility study. Additional safeguards, procurement, and technical due \ndiligence is being supported under TA 8714-REG: Promoting Carbon Capture and Storage in \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China and Indonesia and a direct charge facility provided by the \nCarbon Capture and Storage Fund.  \n \n2.  With existing resources, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is engaging several experts \nto initiate the due diligence process. An international Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) expert \n(2 person-months [PM]) is being hired to conduct technical due diligence and provide inputs for \nenvironmental and social safeguard due diligence. A social safeguards team (national, 3PM; \ninternational  2PM)  will  undertake  social  safeguards  due  diligence.  And  an  environmental \nsafeguards  team  (one  national,  1.5  PM;  one  international  3  PM)  will  review  the  initial \nenvironmental examination, visit the site, and gather inputs from the CCS expert to update the \nenvironmental safeguards due diligence and associated documentation. As these resources are \nexpected to be insufficient to finalize the due diligence (particularly technical, environmental, \nand procurement), this PPTA is sought to complete the necessary project due diligence and \nenhance project readiness.  \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n3.  The PPTA outputs are a fully prepared grant and a successfully completed bidding \nprocess for the carbon capture and storage plant. This will include final technical assessments \nof the proposed carbon capture and storage plant, completed safeguards due diligence, industry \noutreach on the planned project, invitation for bidding, bid evaluation reports, and successful \ncontract negotiations.   \n \n4.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nExpected  Expected \nMajor Activities  Completion Date  Major Outputs  Completion Date \nFielding of consultants  November 2016  Inception report  December 2016 \nProject documents complete  January 2017  Final due diligence reports  January 2017 \nIssuance of bid documents  February 2017  Final bidding documents  February 2017 \nBid evaluation  May 2017  Bid evaluation reports  May 2017 \nContract award  June 2017  Contract negotiations summary  June 2017 \nSource: Asian Development Bank Staff Estimates \n     ", "Appendix 3  9 \n \nC.

The government will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind \ncontributions. The value of government contribution is estimated to account for 9% of the total TA cost. \nSource: Asian Development Bank Staff Estimates \n \nD.  Consulting Services \n6.
