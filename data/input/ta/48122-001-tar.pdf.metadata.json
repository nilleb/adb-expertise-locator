INTRODUCTION \n1.  Economic and infrastructural integration in border areas is critical to development of \nregional  corridors.  Hence,  economic  zones  in  border  areas  are  one  possible  vehicle  for \ntargeting urban infrastructure development, attracting investments, and enhancing cooperation \nin border areas and beyond. The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Strategic Framework, \n2012\u20132022 focuses on widening and deepening the GMS economic corridors, strengthening \ncapacity of local governments, and business planning and research analysis about transforming \ntransport corridors into economic corridors.  The technical assistance (TA) will improve the \ncapacities of GMS border towns in the development and management of economic zones in \nborder areas. These are towns close to the boundary between two countries. It will strengthen \nthe capacity of institutions working in the border areas  ahead of the fourth corridor towns \ndevelopment project (CTDP) in 2018, while contributing to GMS initiatives in various sectors \n(e.g., human resource development). The TA paper was agreed to at the Fourth Meeting of the \nGMS Task Force on Urban Development in Nay Pyi Taw from 18 to 19 August 2015. The TA is \nprioritized in the GMS Urban Development Strategic Framework, 2015\u20132022. It is included in \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Pipeline  for \nSoutheast Asia, 2015\u20132017 and the Regional Investment Framework Implementation Plan, \n2014\u20132018.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Border areas offer opportunities for bilateral cooperation, gross domestic product growth, \nand job creation. They are populous, rapidly developing, and often well demarcated. They are \nconnected  by  modern  transport  infrastructure  and  have  the  potential  of  becoming  growth \ncenters for strengthened rural\u2013urban linkages. Some border areas have economic and political \nsystems as well as cultures and languages similar with their neighboring borders, which are \nconducive to the development of working relationships across borders. Border points along a \ntransport  corridor  have  the  potential  of  linking  markets  and  industrial  centers  while  also \nfacilitating trade and development to the economic hubs that anchor the transport corridors.3  \n3.  Economic  zones  at  the  border,  supported  by  preferential  policies,  can  harness \ncomparative  advantage,  strengthen  industrial  links,  and  generate  spillover  effects  (e.g., \neconomic benefits of increased trade) between two countries sharing a common border. They \ncan play an important role in economic integration by (i) lowering the transaction costs resulting \nfrom border effects, (ii) addressing insufficient supply of transborder public goods, (iii) providing \na platform for local firms to enter into regional or global supply chains, and (iv) reducing the \ninefficiencies in providing reliable industrial infrastructure and urban services that enhance the \nlivability and quality of life of residents and workers in border areas. Joint management of \nindustrial and urban services at the border are another potential area where collective efforts \nmight improve the delivery of services, and environmental management in border areas. \n                                                \n1  GMS Cooperation Program, Fifth GMS Summit. 2014.

Kuala Lumpur. 8\u20139. \n ", "2   \n4.  Past studies have shown that border crossings are the weakest link in realizing the full \npotential of economic corridor development.4 These studies reached the following conclusions: \n(i)  while transport networks help to improve infrastructure connectivity, delays and costs \nare incurred at the border due to a lack of cross-border infrastructure and poor \nlogistics.  Physical  infrastructure  at  border  points  is  often  substandard and  lacks \ncoordinated urban planning and development, modern information, communication \nand technology, and logistics infrastructure;  \n(ii)  environmental protection and biodiversity conservation in border areas is important, \nas watershed and catchment areas have no political or state boundaries. It is difficult \nto identify the source of damage, and the party responsible for remedial measures;  \n(iii)  geographical and sociopolitical nature of border areas further accentuate difficulties \nat the border, as they may be located in mountainous areas and populated by ethnic \nminorities. Military presence and socio-ethnic conflicts also may be the norm where \nthe borders are contested. Such instability discourages traders and investors due to \nhigh cost of trade, time, and inefficiency; and  \n(iv)  unsafe migration practices, weak communicable disease control, and lack of human \nresources are additional risks facing border communities. \n5.  Defining  and  establishing  cross-border  economic  zones  (CBEZs)  in  the  GMS  is  a \nchallenge, as they span across two or more national boundaries and require collective efforts of \ncountries involved.5 Countries are often concerned with sovereignty issues and the legal and \npractical difficulties of reaching agreement to enable operations in CBEZs (e.g., harmonizing \npolicies and legislation). Another issue is the notion of shared interests; while participating \ncountries should perceive mutual and reciprocal benefits as a basis for shared interests to \nmaterialize,  the  benefits  of  a  CBEZ  are  often  lopsided  and  inequitably  distributed.6 Other \nchallenges include insufficient infrastructure, low levels of foreign direct investment, weak legal \nand institutional frameworks and arrangements, and inadequate enabling policies. \n6.  A border economic zone (BEZ) differs from a CBEZ as it is confined within a single \nnational  territory  but  still  requires  collaboration  across  borders.  The  preferred  model  of \neconomic zone development in the GMS is unknown and will vary; however, it should be based \non two types of agglomeration economies (localization and urbanization) where production is \nfacilitated by a clustering of economic activity sufficient to form and grow a city. Studies on \neconomic zones in the GMS have drawn on various success factors for border economic \ncollaboration similar to those used in a Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle study.7 \nThese factors can help determine the nature of economic zone development and levels of \nintervention (Supplementary Appendix A). A technical note on special economic zones in the \nGMS found that a change in focus is necessary from traditional reliance on fiscal incentives and \n                                                \n4  R.

Economic  zone  development  at the  border  requires  effective  urban,  economic,  and \nsocial  planning;  environmental  protection;  and  governance  mechanisms  for  implementing \npolicies,  especially  those  related  to  human  resources,  labor  movements,  and  standards. \nSection-specific concept plans (SSCPs) were prepared for parts of the GMS economic corridors, \nand strategic local economic development plans (SLEDPs) were prepared for towns in the GMS \nCTDPs.  Both  link  local  spatial  plans  and  socioeconomic  development  plans  with  national \neconomic strategies and urban trends for a section of a corridor or town. A joint border action \nplan will build on these plans to provide a basis for further collaboration between the countries \nat the borders by highlighting (i) the comparative advantage of a location, (ii) the socioeconomic \ndimensions of border area investment, (iii) perceived returns, and (iv) priority infrastructure \ndevelopment  to  support  forecasted  economic  growth  in  the  area.9 It  will  help  to  improve \noperational and financial efficiency of urban services at the border, where services are often \nmanaged by a special committee.10 It would be linked to other GMS sector initiatives. \n8.  Linking action plans to investment is essential in translating any concept into action. \nInvestments under the first and second GMS CTDPs have focused on urban development \ninfrastructure in towns along the corridors. The third CTDP focuses on the role of city clusters in \nenhancing a country\u2019s competitive advantage in its border area. The TA will provide a way \nforward for the fourth GMS CTDP  in 2018 and other initiatives  through the completion of \nessential diagnostic studies and implementation of a capacity development program. It will build \non lessons from regional and national urban development projects in the GMS.11  \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be enhanced economic and infrastructural integration of urban centers in \nborder areas for regional corridor development and cooperation in the GMS.

The output will help to increase awareness and \nunderstanding about the different models of economic zone development and their applicability \nin the GMS. Three border areas will be selected from 17 priority border areas listed in the GMS \nUrban Development Strategic Framework, 2015\u20132022 (Supplementary Appendix A). Using a \nmulticriteria assessment, these three border areas will be selected for further BEZ planning and \ndevelopment in output 2 based on parameters that will be developed using the economic zone \nfactors and elements listed in paragraph 7 and Supplementary Appendix A.12 The final selection \nof the three border areas will depend on (i) results from the multicriteria assessment and field \nvisits to the five top border areas, (ii) a review of ongoing initiatives in GMS, (iii) focus group \ndiscussions with border communities, (iv) consideration of localized cross-border area trade \narrangements  (plus  informal  agreements),  and  (v)  mapping  of  parallel  ADB  and  other \ndevelopment  partner  regional  and  national  initiatives  along  the  prioritized  border  area  to \ndemonstrate  synergies  with  other  GMS  sector  initiatives.  The  output  will  also  review  the \nexperience of economic zone development in the region, such as the experience of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China and Kazakhstan in developing a CBEZ at Khorgos as a good example of \nbilateral  cooperation. The  output  will  increase  ADB  and  GMS  governments\u2019  understanding \nabout economic zone development in the GMS and help identify areas for further discussion. \n11.  Output  2:  Comprehensive  institutional  and  capacity  development  program  is \nprepared and implemented. The output will help strengthen the institutional capacity of border \narea institutions through preparation and implementation of a capacity development program for \neach of the three border area prioritized (output 1). The capacity development program will (i) \ninclude  preparation  of  a  joint  BEZ  action  plan,  which  will  focus  on  urban  planning  and \ninfrastructure prioritization, as it supports one of the stages of economic zone development \n(Supplementary Appendix A); and (ii) build on other GMS initiatives to include a joint border \narea urban and spatial plan (para. 8), a capacity needs assessment, actions for policy and \ninstitutional development, steps for attracting private sector participation, a value chains and \nlogistics analysis, and a list of prioritized investments in urban infrastructure. \n12.  The joint BEZ action plan will consider legal aspects to enable and promote economic \nzones, particularly in cases where countries may have a formal agreement for border economic \nzone development. It will consider safe migration, the presence of an informal cross-border \nlabor force, and social and environmental impacts of BEZ development. It will be linked to other \nGMS sector initiatives important for economic zone development (e.g., transport and trade \nfacilitation action program and agro-products). It will reflect perceptions of local communities, \ngovernments, and operators and businesses. The output will help identify countries that may \nrequire additional assistance to help resolve country-specific constraints. \n13.  The capacity development program, based on a needs assessment, will also include a \nproposal for a joint urban management structure in integrated urban development through \ncoordinated approaches and joint prioritization of public infrastructure investment. Each capacity \ndevelopment program will be tailored to each of the three border areas selected in output 1 and \nmay  be  applicable  to  any  of  the  stages  of  economic  zone  development  (Supplementary \nAppendix A). Any proposal for a joint urban management structure will identify ways of involving \nthe public, private, and/or local community in operation and maintenance. It will aim to improve \noperational and financial efficiency of services. \n                                                \n12 The number of border areas selected is subject to available financing for the fourth GMS CTDP. \n ", "5 \n \n14.  Output 3: Flagship program for the fourth Greater Mekong Subregion Corridor \nTowns Development Project is defined and applied. The output will prepare a working paper \nto guide preparation of the fourth GMS CDTP or another GMS initiative in urban development. \nGMS CTDPs are characterized by the following features: (i) cross-sector or multisector and \ninvolve two or more countries, (ii) based along GMS corridors, (iii) include a combination of \ninfrastructure development and capacity development activities, and (iv) financed by public \nand/or private sector investments. The fourth GMS CTDP will focus on urban infrastructure \ndevelopment in the three border areas prioritized in output 1, each with a joint BEZ action plan \nto demonstrate the alignment of urban planning and infrastructure development with projected \neconomic growth at the border areas.  \n15.  The main risks to the TA hinge on participating governments\u2019 understanding of the BEZ \nconcept; participating GMS governments\u2019 political commitment to cooperating across sovereign \nboundaries; and financing to carry forward the policy and institutional recommendations into an \ninvestment project. The TA will manage these risks and minimize their effects.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the PRC Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund and administered by ADB. \nThe GMS governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, meeting \nrooms, and other in-kind contributions. TA disbursement will be front-loaded utilizing the PRC \nRegional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund first. The GMS governments have been \ninformed that TA approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing TA or investment project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years (10 November 2015 to 8 November 2018). \nADB will be the executing agency; the Urban Development and Water Division of the Southeast \nAsia  Department  will  implement  the  TA.  GMS  national  coordinators  (or  delegated \nrepresentatives) will coordinate the TA in their respective countries. Joint border task force \ngroups, comprising of representatives from different line ministries may be set up to for the TA \nat each border. The TA will work with other GMS sector initiatives in coordinating site visits, \ncollecting data collection, and ensuring synergies. ADB will engage TA consultants through a \nfirm in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time), following fixed budget selection (full technical proposal). The firm will include seven \ninternational specialists (22 person-months) and GMS national research coordinators during \nimplementation. National experts shall be confirmed by respective countries. Goods will be \nprocured using the shopping procedure, as packages will be less than $100,000 equivalent \neach. TA disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
