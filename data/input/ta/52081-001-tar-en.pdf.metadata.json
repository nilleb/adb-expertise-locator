INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will enhance the effectiveness of \nthe  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area  (BIMP-\nEAGA)1 and the Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT)2 as building blocks of \nand platforms for regional cooperation and integration (RCI) of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations (ASEAN).3 The bottom-up and project-driven approaches of BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT \ncomplement the top-down approach taken by ASEAN. The TA is aligned with strategic documents \nendorsed by the Summits of Leaders in April 2017: the BIMP-EAGA Vision 2025 (BEV 2025); the \nIMT-GT Vision 2036; the IMT-GT Implementation Blueprint, 2017\u20132021; and the Operational Plan \nfor Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).4 \nThe BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT members strongly support the TA outcome, outputs, and activities \nas these are in line with their request for continued ADB assistance.5 It aims to strengthen links \nand coordination with ASEAN, improve project design, build capacities of government officials, \nand promote the sharing of lessons and experiences of the subregions in Southeast Asia. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  BIMP-EAGA aims to accelerate socioeconomic development of lagging, marginalized, \nand geographically remote areas in its member countries as part of a broader goal to narrow \ndevelopment gaps within each country and between the subregion and ASEAN. IMT-GT plans to \nfast-track the economic transformation of the states and provinces in its member countries by \nexploiting complementarities and comparative advantages. The subregional programs also aim \nto  reduce  inequalities  and  reflect  shared  global  aspirations  as  outlined  in  Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 10, which can be achieved through systematic interventions at subnational, \nnational, and subregional levels.  \n \n3.  ADB, which has provided support since 1996, is the regional development advisor to \nBIMP-EAGA and a regional development partner to IMT-GT. Since 2015, ADB has provided \nassistance through two TA projects that are due to close in December 2018: (i) Advancing \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  through  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013\nPhilippines East ASEAN Growth Area and Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Thailand Growth Triangle6 and \n(ii) Building Capacity for Enhanced Connectivity in Southeast Asia7 also known as the BIMP-\n                                                \n1  Established in 1994, BIMP-EAGA covers the sultanate of Brunei Darussalam; the provinces of Kalimantan, Sulawesi, \nMaluku, and Papua of Indonesia; the states of Sabah and Sarawak and the federal territory of Labuan in Malaysia; \nand Mindanao and the province of Palawan in the Philippines.  \n2  Established in 1993, the IMT-GT geographic area includes 32 provinces and states\u201410 provinces in Sumatra in \nIndonesia, 8 states in Peninsular Malaysia, and 14 provinces in southern Thailand. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 February 2018. \n4  BIMP-EAGA. 2017.

Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration (2016-2020). Manila. \n5  Key features of the TA were discussed at (i) 21st BIMP-EAGA Ministerial Meeting (3 December 2017) and 26th \nSenior Officials Meeting (1\u20132 December 2017) in Tarakan, Indonesia; and (ii) 23rd IMT-GT Ministerial Meeting (29 \nSeptember 2017) and 24th Senior Officials Meeting (27\u201328 September 2017) in Bangka Belitung, Indonesia. \n6  ADB. 2014.

The TA project\u2019s key achievements include (i) green cities action plans in seven cities and ASEAN \ngreen cities network; (ii) preparation of BEV 2025 and IMT-GT Tourism Strategic Framework 2017\u20132036; (iii) studies \non cross-border power interconnections, economic corridors, value chains, and border area development; (iv) \nstatistical databases; and (v) institutional strengthening for BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center and Centre for IMT-GT \nSubregional Cooperation.  \n7  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Building Capacity for Enhanced Connectivity in Southeast Asia. Manila (TA \n8836). Also known as the BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT, and GMS Capacity Building Program or B-I-G Program, the TA \n ", "2 \nEAGA, IMT-GT and GMS Capacity Building Program or B-I-G Program. The success factors, \nlessons, and principles of both TA projects are incorporated in the design of this knowledge and \nsupport TA. ADB assistance to BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT has helped them adapt to changes in \nthe  development  landscape,  draw  new  strategic  documents,  and  supported  preparation  of \nsubregional  project  pipelines. Weak  institutional  capacities  were  strengthened  with  modest \nassistance leveraged by developing member countries\u2019 significant and continual support to their \nsubregional programs. \n \n4.  Both subregions recognize significant constraints in performance. Reforms have been \nslow and continue to be a challenge because of institutional, human resources, and capacity \nweaknesses.  ADB  support  is  needed  to  address  weaknesses  and  gaps  in  (i)  effective \nimplementation of new strategic plans, (ii) deepening cooperation with ASEAN, (iii) converting \nproject  pipelines  into  bankable  projects,  (iv)  enhancing  capacities  in  project  design  and \nimplementation,  (v)  establishing  results  monitoring  systems,  (vi)  building  capacities  of \ngovernment officials, and (vii) promoting links and synergies in ASEAN subregions. \n \n5.  For  ADB\u2019s  support  to  add  value,  both  subregional  programs  need  to  address  the \nchallenges that hamper their effectiveness as they implement the BEV 2025, IMT-GT Vision 2036, \nand  IMT-GT  Implementation  Blueprint,  2017\u20132021.  The  new  strategic  documents  include \npipelines of priority infrastructure projects totaling $21.4 billion for BIMP-EAGA and $48.4 billion \nfor IMT-GT. Effective functioning of the two subregions is constrained by (i) weak strategic and \ninstitutional links and coordination with ASEAN; (ii) lack of well-designed RCI projects and weak \nresults monitoring; and (iii) limited capacities of government officials to develop and implement \nRCI policies, programs, and projects. \n \n6.  Weak strategic and institutional links and coordination with the Association of \nSoutheast  Asian  Nations.  More  synergy  and  complementation  are  needed  to  meet  the \nrequirements for the ASEAN Economic Community as well as new and updated ASEAN strategic \ndocuments and sector strategies. To achieve the ASEAN connectivity agenda promoted by both \nsubregions, more focused support is required in transport, energy, and transport and trade \nfacilitation. Simple but strategic links to ASEAN in tourism, agriculture, environment, and human \nresource development need to be strengthened, given the mixed results noted in assessments of \nthe BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT Implementation Blueprints, 2012\u20132016. \n \n7.  Lack of well-designed regional cooperation and integration projects and weak \nresults monitoring. Both subregions are setting up project management and results-based \nmonitoring and evaluation systems as part of their institutional enhancements. The subregions \nneed to address limited capacities in project design, poor delivery systems, weak alignment with \nsubregional agenda, and poor monitoring and evaluation, which hamper the effectiveness of \nprojects and their impacts. Both subregional secretariats are becoming fully functional and \noperational. Pending legalization, the BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Center (BIMP-FC) is operating on \nan  interim  basis  with  no  dedicated  staff  from  member  countries.  The  Centre  for  IMT-GT \nSubregional Cooperation (CIMT) needs support to facilitate leadership transition when a new \nmanagement team takes over in December 2018. BIMP-FC and CIMT need technical support in \ncoordination with ASEAN, update and improve project pipelines, project implementation, and \nresults monitoring. This TA will focus on RCI pipeline formulation.  \n \n8.  Limited  capacities  of  government  officials  to  develop  and  implement  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  policies,  programs,  and  projects.  Building  civil  servants\u2019 \n                                                \norganized 17 training sessions and workshops on RCI attended by 481 government officials, collaborated with 17 \npartner institutions, and promoted knowledge and experience sharing. \n ", "3 \ncapacities in policy, planning, and project management to promote RCI remains a long-term \nchallenge. This will be essential for BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT officials to support the effective \nimplementation of their new strategic plans. Another challenge is the shortage of institutions \noffering  demand-based and  customized  RCI training  as this requires extensive  experience \nworking with the subregions, significant sector expertise, and country knowledge\u2014all areas in \nwhich ADB has comparative advantages. Knowledge and experience sharing among BIMP-\nEAGA, IMT-GT, and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\u2014needs to be continued. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT more integrated \nwithin themselves, subregionally, and with the larger ASEAN region.8 The TA\u2019s outcome will be \nmore effective implementation of BIMP-EAGA and IMT-GT subregional programs.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Strategic,  sector,  and  institutional  links  and  coordination  between \nsubregional programs and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations improved. The TA \nwill strategically support greater complementation and links of the BEV 2025, IMT-GT Vision 2036, \nand  IMT-GT  Implementation  Blueprint,  2017\u20132021  with  broader  ASEAN  frameworks  and \ninitiatives in areas where ADB can leverage its expertise. It will help tap the technical expertise of \nthe ASEAN Secretariat and translate ASEAN agreements into demonstration or pilot projects \nusing a \u201ctest-bed approach\u201d in select sectors. Two modalities may be pursued: (i) pilot testing the \nimplementation of ASEAN agreements in the subregions and (ii) scaling up new initiatives and \ngood practices originated from the subregions for implementation at the ASEAN level. Activities \nmay include consultations or workshops with ASEAN sector bodies to identify sector approaches \nto  pilot  test  ASEAN  agreements  or  scale  up  subregional  initiatives  at  the  ASEAN  level. \nCooperation could start in a few sectors with the greatest synergistic relationships and potential \nfor deeper cooperation in ASEAN, BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT, and GMS. These may include tourism, \ntransport facilitation, connectivity, and agriculture. The TA will facilitate regular meetings and/or \ndiscussions with the ASEAN Secretariat, BIMP-FC, CIMT, and GMS Secretariat to strengthen \nsector and institutional coordination. \n \n11.  Output 2: Project development and managing for development results enhanced. \nThe TA will provide technical and advisory support to BIMP-FC and CIMT in (i) strengthening \ncoordination with the ASEAN Secretariat; (ii) updating and revising RCI project pipelines; (iii) \nimplementing projects; (iv) monitoring results; and (v) operationalizing the project appraisal \ncommittees, which act as a quality control mechanism to ensure projects are well designed, \nfeasible, and deliver results. The TA will support preparation of analytical and thematic studies on \ngreen cities10, economic corridor development, integrated border areas, trade facilitation, and \npower interconnections. In the TA for Advancing Regional Cooperation and Integration in BIMP-\nEAGA and IMT-GT (footnote 6), ADB recruited International Council for Local Environmental \nInitiatives\u2212Local Governments for Sustainability-South Asia to assist Kota Kinabalu in preparing \n                                                \n8  BIMP-EAGA. 2017.

They are resilient, inclusive, and manage natural resources well. \n ", "4 \nits green city action plan. ADB will continue working with them under this TA to help two more \ncities in BIMP-EAGA prepare their green city action plans.  \n \n12.  Output 3. Capacities of civil servants in design and implementation of regional \ncooperation  and  integration  policies,  programs,  and  projects  enhanced.  The  TA  will \ncontinue to provide the training and workshops implemented under the B-I-G Program. Training \nmay cover project management, economic corridor development, special economic zones, urban \ndevelopment, and green cities. Priority participants will be from the national secretariats, working \ngroups, and implementing agencies involved in BIMP-EAGA, IMT-GT, and GMS programs and \nprojects. Partnerships with multilateral and international organizations, governments, academic \ninstitutions, and other ADB TA projects will be continued. The TA will continue monitoring \nperformance and evaluation systems established in the B-I-G Program to measure outputs \nthrough pre- and post- tests. Tracer studies will be conducted to assess the application of \nknowledge acquired and skills developed in the work place. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.7 million, of which (i) $1.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $700,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional \nCooperation Fund (PRCF)11 and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items of the TA are \nin Appendix 2.  \n \n14.  The  PRCF  will  finance  capacity  building  and  dissemination  of  knowledge  products \n(including field visits to learn from each other\u2019s country experiences), as well as recruitment of \nconsultants to provide policy advice. It will not be used for permanent staffing costs or to hire staff \nconsultants and fund activities that will involve civil works and large-scale equipment procurement. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  administer  the  KSTA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division of the Southeast Asia Department. The division will implement the TA from \nAugust 2018 to 31 December 2020 in consultation with the department\u2019s sector divisions and \nresident missions. The division also will select, supervise, and evaluate individual consultants and \nfirms; procure nonconsulting services; organize conferences, training, and/or workshops and \ndisseminate knowledge products; provide staff to act as the resource persons for the training and \nworkshops; and monitor TA implementation.12 \n \n16.   ADB will provide financial and implementation reports to the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China annually on the use of PRCF funds. If a major change in the implementation \narrangements is needed, ADB will consult with the government on the required changes.  \n \n17.  Consulting services. A total of 108 person-months of consulting services and about 25 \nresource persons will be required to implement the TA. Given the wide range of skills and sector \nexpertise required by the TA, as well as the importance of familiarity with the BIMP-EAGA and \nIMT-GT subregional programs, the required consultants are unlikely to be available in a single \nfirm. ADB will mostly engage individual consultants to provide the expertise required to implement \n                                                \n11 The fund was originally named People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund in a \n2005 Board paper. \n12 ADB will obtain a no-objection in writing from the relevant developing member countries prior to conducting or \nfinancing any TA activities. \n ", "5 \nthe TA activities following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nits associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions.13  \n \n18.  Procurement. In organizing training sessions, workshops, and meetings, ADB will use \nthe  shopping  method  to  procure  nonconsulting  services.  Procurement  will  follow  the  ADB \nProcurement Policy and staff instructions on Technical Assistance Procurement of Goods, Works, \nand Nonconsulting Services.14  \n \n19.  The TA will prepare annual reports highlighting progress and achievements of outputs and \nactivities. These will be disseminated internally in ADB and externally through the B-I-G Program \nwebsite. The knowledge products prepared under the TA will be disseminated through high-level \nmeetings,  ADB  training  sessions,  and  workshops.  They  will  be  printed  and  distributed  to \nstakeholders, as necessary. \n \n20.
