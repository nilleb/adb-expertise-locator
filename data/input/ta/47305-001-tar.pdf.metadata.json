The Government of Uzbekistan asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on 3 October \n2013 for technical assistance (TA) to support cotton mechanization and crop diversification, and \nto complement the recently approved Amu Bukhara Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project.1 \nADB fielded a TA fact-finding mission during 5\u201315 November 2013 to evaluate key challenges \nand opportunities, and to consult with public and private stakeholders, to finalize the TA design \nand its implementation arrangements. The government concurred with the TA impact, outcome, \noutputs,  cost,  implementation  and  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Agriculture still plays a significant role in Uzbekistan\u2019s economy. In 2011, it employed \nabout 27% of the country\u2019s total labor force.3 While the national level of low-income people has \ndeclined from 21.8% in 2008 to 17.7% in 2010, 18.15% of the rural population, who largely \ndepends  on  agriculture,  still  has  low  incomes.  They  spend  53%  of  their  income  on  food, \ncompared with 33% spent by the urban residents.4 \n \n3.   Uzbekistan\u2019s agriculture sector is largely dominated by cotton and wheat farming, which \nis the main water-consuming subsector.5 In 2012, the two crops accounted for about 70% of the \ntotal cultivated area, producing 34% of gross output of agriculture and accounting for 30% of \nrural employment.6 The government largely supports wheat production to achieve food self-\nsufficiency. State-controlled procurement, pricing, processing, and marketing governs cotton, \nand to a lesser extent wheat, production. Export revenues from the cotton supply chain helped \nfinance the government\u2019s import-substituting policies.  \n \n4.  Other  important  crops  are  fruit,  nuts,  vegetables,  and  fodder,  and  government \ninvolvement is minimal. Uzbekistan is one of the major suppliers of fresh and processed fruits \nand vegetables in the region. In 2011, the agriculture sector grew by 6.6%, supported by fruit \nand vegetable production and livestock breeding.7 The sector covers 90% of domestic demand \nfor agriculture products and 70% of domestic trade.8 Yet the country remains a net food importer, \nexcept  for  fruit  and  vegetable  products.  Diversification  to  non-cotton  and  wheat  crops  is \nhampered by government\u2019s commitment to ensure self-sufficiency in wheat production and to \nmaintain its export receipts from cotton. With lack of price incentives to farmers to be more \nproductive and efficient, cotton supply that sustains export revenues is achieved by devoting \nhuge tracts of agriculture land to cotton production.  \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

The government\u2019s Welfare Improvement Strategy for 2012\u20132015 aims to reduce the \nnational level of low-income people from 17.7% in 2010 to 13.7% by 2015.9 This will entail \nprimarily greater rural productivity and more income-generating activities. Key measures to \nachieve these objectives are (i) further structural reforms to agriculture and the diversification of \nagricultural production; (ii) mechanization of the sector, infrastructure build-up, and agribusiness \ndevelopment; (iii) more productive use of land and water; and (iv) greater financial stability of \nfarm entities and more market-oriented agricultural policies. \n \n6.  Rural labor is getting scarce as people migrate to urban centers for jobs in the more \nlucrative  industrial  and  service  sectors.  In  response,  the  government  aims  to  expand \nmechanization by (i) exempting imported agricultural machinery that is intended for lease from \ncustoms duty and value-added tax; (ii) widening access to credit for suppliers of farm machinery \nand equipment that use locally produced parts; and (iii) establishing a special fund in the \nMinistry of Finance for Uzselhozmashlizing (Uzbekistan financing institution for purchase of \nagricultural machinery) to  provide  low-interest  lease financing for  agricultural  equipment  to \nagricultural machine-tractor parks (agricultural machinery leasing), other joint-stock companies \nthat provide agricultural services, and farmers. However, these initiatives are driven more by the \ngovernment and suppliers, and lack detailed analysis of market demand, farmers\u2019 financial and \ntechnical capacity, and the machinery\u2019s suitability to more profitable farming systems. There is \nalso a need to improve institutional and financing mechanisms in procurement and leasing of \nagricultural machinery through possible involvement of the private sector. \n \n7.  To promote crop diversification, the government has been gradually reducing the cotton-\ngrowing areas, starting with low-production sites. By 2015, about 130,000 hectares (ha) of \ncotton areas are planned to be released for the production of high-value crops (HVCs) such as \nvegetables and fruit. To date, about 12,000 ha have been released for HVC farming. Market \ndemand and supply for a suite of HVCs in Uzbekistan\u2019s various provinces, however, has to be \nanalyzed to determine which HVCs are most suitable and can be integrated in the dominant \ncotton\u2013wheat farming system. This entails (i) demonstration of cotton\u2013wheat\u2013HVC farming with \nappropriate technological and agronomic practices, and (ii) comparisons of the technical (yield \nimpact) and socioeconomic (profitability; efficient use of labor, land, and water; and gender \nempowerment)  performance  of  the  demonstration  farms  with  the  traditional  cotton\u2013wheat \nfarming system. It also means assessing the policy, institutional, and investment implications of \ncrop diversification for potential government action.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s Amu Bukhara Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project (footnote 1) contributes in \npart to the goal of sustainable economic and social welfare improvement. Specifically, the \nproject  will  upgrade  irrigation  infrastructure,  promote  efficient  water  supply,  and  pilot  crop \ndiversification in the Amu Bukhara irrigation system's command area of about 250,000 ha in the \nBukhara and Navoi provinces. The ADB-financed Land Improvement Project, which covers \n162,300  ha  of  irrigated  land,  also  contributes  to  the  desired  development  outcomes  by \nmitigating  land  degradation  due  to  soil  salinization  in  these  provinces  and  Kashkadarya \nProvince.10  \n \n9.  While water- and land-enhancing interventions are important to sustain and improve \nfarm incomes, they need to be complemented by better farming systems that use more effective \ntechnical and agronomic practices and improve labor use and crop yields. This TA proposes to \n                                                \n9  Republic of Uzbekistan. 2013. Welfare Improvement Strategy of Uzbekistan (2012\u20132015). Tashkent. \n10 ADB. 2007. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the \nRepublic of Uzbekistan for the Land Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "  3 \nfill two major gaps in Uzbekistan's farming systems: (i) broaden access to agricultural machinery \nsuch as cotton harvesters and cultivators by exploring financing options (such as leasing, credit \nline)  and  potential  engagement  of  the  private  sector;  and  (ii)  promote  crop  diversification \nthrough market-driven HVCs that are suitable for integrated cotton\u2013wheat\u2013HVC farming.  \n \n10.  Mechanized farming of cotton and wheat will reduce the need to employ forced labor \nduring harvesting. International experience with mechanical harvesting is that it can produce the \nsame quality cotton with less waste than hand picking, and is also hygienic.11 This would have \nan important bearing on international concerns over the use of forced labor during cotton \nharvesting in Uzbekistan. In response to such concerns raised by civil society and others, the \ngovernment accepted for the first time the involvement of the International Labour Organization \nin joint monitoring of labor issues during the 2013 cotton harvest season. ADB is coordinating \nclosely with the International Labour Organization, as well as other development partners, on \nthis matter. The government's target to increase the number of cotton harvesting machines \nduring 2012\u20132016 will significantly reduce labor requirements, including child or forced labor, \nduring cotton harvesting. \n \n11.  Uzbekistan women will benefit from mechanization in particular, and from more efficient \nintegrated farming systems in general. They perform multifarious roles aside from household \nchores. Specifically, they work in cotton and wheat fields from cultivation to harvesting. They \nalso take care of the dekhan farms (small household plots), which are the main source of cash \nincome for farm households. Mechanization will help not only eliminate child or forced labor but \nalso reduce the burden of women in cotton production and harvesting, and enhance households\u2019 \ncash incomes through increased HVC production.   \n \n12.  The  TA  will  support  the  Welfare  Improvement  Strategy  for  2012\u20132015  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to enforce international labor standards by working on key aspects of \nthe agriculture strategy: (i) promoting crop diversification through demonstration of an integrated \ncotton\u2013wheat\u2013HVC farming system; (ii) assisting mechanization by exploring financing options \n(including leasing arrangements, credit line) for agricultural machinery and other production \ntools; and (iii) finding more  opportunities for private agribusiness investment. \n \n13.  The TA is consistent with the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for Uzbekistan, \nwhich supports the country\u2019s transformation into a modern industrial and service economy \nthrough  sustained  and  inclusive  growth,  and  poverty  reduction,  among  others.12 To  help \nimprove the business environment in Uzbekistan, the country partnership strategy specifies that \nADB provide demand-led TA in areas determined jointly with the government. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The TA  impact  will  be  greater  profitability  of farmers. The TA  outcome  will  be the \ndevelopment of investment concepts for agricultural mechanization and crop diversification. \n \n                                                \n11 M. Shafiq, M.

Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be:  (i)  suitable  financing  arrangements  for  agricultural \nmechanization  and  crop  diversification  developed,  and  (ii)  diversified  cropping  systems \nimproved. \n \n16.  Output  1:  Suitable  financing  arrangements  for  agricultural  mechanization  and \ncrop diversification developed. The TA will first conduct a gap analysis of current financing \nand  institutional  arrangements  (as  well  as  leasing  modalities)  for  provision  of  agricultural \nmachinery, particularly cotton harvesting machines. The TA will also point out international good \npractices of financing, and private or public\u2013private investment mechanisms that are suitable for \nUzbekistan\u2019s  efforts  to  mechanize  farming  and  diversify  crops,  including  risk  management \ninstruments for value-chain financing\u2014e.g., repurchase agreement, trade receivables finance, \ntrader finance, warehouse receipts, and commodity finance. Farm-specific assessments will \nevaluate farmers\u2019 financial and technical capacity, and the farming system\u2019s suitability for the \nrecommended  agricultural  machinery.  Based  on  the  analyses,  the  TA  will  (i)  recommend \nfinancial  and  institutional  mechanisms  (a)  for  provision  of  energy-efficient  agricultural \nmachinery, in particular lease finance and alternative financing modalities for cotton harvesting \nmachines and other farming tools, and (b) for crop production, processing, and storage, with \npotential public\u2013private partnership or full private sector financing; (ii) prepare and implement a \nplan to increase the capacity of relevant agencies for new financing mechanisms; and (iii) \ndevelop a concept for investing in agricultural mechanization, which will include a credit line. \n \n17.  Output 2: Diversified cropping systems improved. Through analysis of constraints \nand  opportunities  in  growing  and  supplying  HVCs,  the  TA  will  recommend  \n(i) potential HVCs that meet market demand and suit agro-ecological and logistics conditions;  \nand (ii) how to promote certain HVCs, given the weather and soil conditions, in at least two \nprovinces.13 In  parallel,  the  TA  will  pilot-test  two  types  of  mechanized  farming  systems:  \n(i) cotton\u2013wheat\u2013HVCs farming and (ii) HVC farming in cotton-free areas.14 Partnerships with \nprivate sector suppliers of agricultural machinery and input will be explored for the pilot-tests. \nThe TA will study the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the two types of farming \nsystems, with a focus on the opportunity costs of land, water, energy, and labor; and on the \nsocial implications of replacing rural labor with machinery. A key aspect of the output is to \ndemonstrate (i) how effective and efficient mechanization and agronomic practices will lead to \nan increase in cotton and wheat yields despite using less land, water, fuel, and labor; and (ii) \nthat this will allow to reduce (a) the cotton areas in favor of growing HVCs and (b) child labor \nand/or forced labor. Based on the analytical results and pilot tests, the TA will recommend a \npackage of policy measures, action plan, and institutional arrangements for crop diversification, \nand develop a concept for investing in crop diversification including potential credit support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \n                                                \n13The selected provinces will meet the following criteria: (i) they are benefitting from ADB's ongoing irrigation \ninvestment projects; (ii) they include local governments that plan to reduce cotton areas in favor of an integrated \ncotton\u2013wheat\u2013HVC  farming  system;  and  (iii)  they  include  areas  that  do  not  have  significant  development \nassistance for HVCs. \n14 The test site of the cotton\u2013wheat\u2013HVC farming system with a target size of 50\u2013100 ha will be in the Jondor district \nof Bukhara Province, where one of three demonstration farms financed by ADB\u2019s Land Improvement Project is \nlocated, and which is also within the command area of the Amu Bukhara Irrigation System Rehabilitation Project.  \n ", "  5 \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and their domestic transport, office \naccommodation and utilities in Tashkent and two provinces, logistical support during field visits, \ndata and reports as needed, workshop facilitation, secretarial assistance, the use of agricultural \nmachinery procured and to be procured under the Land Improvement Project (footnote 10), and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years (January 2014\u2013December 2016). ADB will be \nresponsible for overall TA management and coordination. The Environment, Natural Resources \nand Agriculture Division of the Central and West Asia Department, and the Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment and Food Security Unit of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \nwill be the focal point in ADB for the TA implementation in collaboration with the Uzbekistan \nResident Mission.  \n \n20.  The Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR) will be the executing agency. \nA special TA steering committee co-chaired by the minister of economy and the minister of \nMAWR, with members from the Ministry of Economy, MAWR, the Ministry of Labor and Social \nWelfare, and the Uzbekistan Fund for Reconstruction and Development, will be established and \nmeet half-yearly to provide policy guidance. The deputy minister of agriculture in MAWR will be \ndesignated as the TA director with responsibility for overall TA implementation and will appoint \ntwo TA coordinators from provincial agriculture departments to oversee the pilot-test activities in \ncooperation with TA consultants and other stakeholders.15 \n \n21.  The TA requires 14 person-months of international consulting services and 39 person-\nmonths of national consulting services covering agricultural development, agricultural science, \nagricultural  financing,  agricultural  engineering,  agriculture  and  marketing  economics,  and \ncapacity development. The consultants will be recruited through a firm using quality- and cost-\nbased selection with a ratio of 80:20. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time), and consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  Monitoring and evaluation are integral to the design and implementation of the TA. In \ncoordination with MAWR, a baseline assessment at TA inception and outcome evaluation at TA \ncompletion will be undertaken. Provincial and district statistics will be verified and validated in \nterms of veracity and credibility in their use for monitoring and assessing the outcome and \nimpact targets. \n \nIV.
