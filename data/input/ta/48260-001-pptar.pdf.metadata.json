A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is needed to further develop public \ntransport programs and investments in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). The proposed PPTA will \nfocus on developing a series of innovative and transformational interventions, which enhance \nthe quality of public transport systems and increase the modal share of public transport.  The \nPPTA will  assess and prepare the priority investments of HCMC mass rapid transit (MRT) Line \n5 \u2013 Phase 1 Project and HCMC Traffic Control Center (HTCC) Project. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The  PPTA  will  develop  the  overall  multitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  Investment \nProgram, further define the proposed components and finalize tranche 1 investments.  The \nPPTA  will  undertake  an  assessment  of  relevant  HCMC  public  transport  subsector  issues, \nincluding the HCMC urban transport masterplan (HUTMP) implementation, reviewing policies, \nregulations and institutional arrangements and identification of capacity development needs.1  \nThe PPTA will develop measures to promote public transport in HCMC, including the proposed \nTraffic Management Planning Study and identify investment needs in subsequent tranches.   \n \n3.  The PPTA will finalize the draft feasibility study for MRT Line 5 \u2013 Phase 1 project  \nprepared in 2012, including: (i) updating the environment impact assessment (EIA) and draft \nresettlement plan to meet ADB safeguard policy statement requirements, (ii) cost estimate and \nfinancing  plan  review,  and  (iii)  an  assessment  of  integration  and  all  other  cofinancier \nrequirements.2  The draft feasibility study will be revised based on findings prior to approval by \nHCMC  People\u2019s  Committee  (HCMC  PC).    After  feasibility  study  approval,  the  front  end \nengineering design (FEED) will be undertaken over an 18 month period, to ensure all design \nissues are resolved and cost estimate finalized prior to ADB consideration of the MFF.3 Bidding \ndocuments will be prepared and procurement commenced prior to design approval.  \n \n4.  For the proposed HTCC project, the PPTA will review the feasibility study to be prepared \nby World Bank consultants in 2015 to identify amendments to meet ADB requirements and \ndetermine the sub-components to be included under tranche 1.4   \n \n5.  The three main PPTA components: (i) HTCC feasibility study review, (ii) MRT Line 5 \nafter FEED completed, and (iii) public transport assessment and recommendations will be all \nincorporated into the PPTA Draft Final Report in 2016.   \n \n6.  The PPTA will assist with advance action for tranche 1 implementation, until the tranche \n1 loan funded consultants are mobilized in 2017, to ensure start-up and implementation delays \n                                                \n1  The PPTA services will partially rely on urban transport studies being undertaken by technical assistance for the \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche Financing Facility \nto the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Ho Chi Minh City Urban Mass Rapid Transit Line 2 Investment \nProgram  and  and  the  Report  and  Recommendation  of the  President  to  the  Board of  Directors:  Proposed \nMultitranche Financing Facility to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Sustainable Urban Transport for Ho Chi \nMinh City Mass Rapid Line 2 Project. \n2  Cost estimate review is financed using internal European Investment Bank technical assistance funding. \n3  The HCMC PC has submitted in March 2014 an application to the Project Preparation and Start-up Support Facility        \nfor $13.2 million to complete the MRT Line 5 FEED. \n4 The feasibility study is being prepared under the proposed Green Transport Project, funded by World Bank.
