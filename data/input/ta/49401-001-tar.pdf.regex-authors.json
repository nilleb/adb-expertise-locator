INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Supporting the Reform of the Role \nof the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC). ADB used teleconferences and e-mail communications to \nreach an understanding with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation \narrangements,  costs,  and  consultants\u2019  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2016\u201320181 for the PRC2 and was discussed with relevant development partners.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The 2008 global financial crisis prompted  a reexamination of banking and financial \nregulatory systems, and financial system stability and integration with monetary policy in many \ncountries. In the PRC while the global financial crisis did not have a significant direct impact, the \ninterconnection of the PRC\u2019s financial system globally did expose challenges and confirm that \nensuring financial stability is a major priority.  Risks to the PRC\u2019s financial stability surface from \nthe structure of its financial sector with the dominance of state owned commercial banks, as well \nas from fragmentation in the frameworks for macroprudential and microprudential oversight.  In \nresponse to these risks certain steps have been taken. These actions include expansion of \nmechanisms to assess systemic risk, improvements in sharing relevant statistical data across \nthe financial stability framework, and enhancing coordination between the PBC and financial \nsector supervisors through formation of the Financial Crisis Response Group under the State \nCouncil and the Financial Regulatory Coordination Joint Ministerial Committee. \n \n3.  The  original  1995  Law  on  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China4 was  revised  in  2003, \nseparating central banking functions from banking supervision when these were transferred to \nthe newly created China Banking Regulatory Commission. Both the PRC\u2019s economy and global \nfinance  have  undergone  significant  changes  since  1995.  Given  its  financial  supervisory \nframework, the PBC may not be equipped to effectively manage systemic risks caused by \ndifficulties in financial stability policy coordination, thereby impairing efforts to create a modern, \nmarket-based financial system. Efforts by the PBC to review and revise its mandate are in line \nwith global developments since the global financial crisis. Since that time there have been \nfundamental changes globally to central banking, especially for financial stability arrangements. \nMajor global central banks (including the Federal Reserve System, European Central Bank, and \nthe Bank of England) have undertaken substantial reforms or reorganized in response to new \nchallenges  that  resulted  from  the  crisis.  These  challenges  include  highly  integrated  and \nincreasingly  interdependent  global  financial  systems,  prompt  transfers  of  monetary  policy \ndecision implications from one country to another, risks from financial institutions that are too big \nto fail,5 and rapid movements of global financial liquidity.   \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2016\u20132018. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 March 2016. \n3  The TA was discussed with the International Monetary Fund during the 29 January 2016 ADB-IMF Retreat in \nManila. \n4  \u201cAdopted at the Third Session of the Eighth National People's Congress on March 18, 1995, promulgated by Order \nNo. 46 of the President of the People's Republic of China on March 18, 1995, and amended in accordance with the \nDecision on Amending the Law of the People's Republic of China on the People's Bank of China adopted at the 6th \nMeeting of the Standing Committee of the Tenth National People's Congress on December 27, 2003.\u201d Database of \nLaws and Regulations. Law of the People's Republic of China on the People's Bank of China. \n    http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/12/content_1383712.htm (accessed 16 March 2016). \n5  Financial institutions that are so large and interconnected that their failure would have a severe impact on a \ncountry\u2019s economy, and they must be supported by the government when they face potential failure. \n ", " 2 \n4.  To  address  these,  governance  frameworks  concerning  organizational  roles  and \nresponsibilities  and  overall  authorities  have  been  enhanced,  financial  tool  kits  have  been \nstrengthened,  and  financial  stability  mandates  and  macroprudential  supervisory  powers  of \ncentral banks have been expanded. Regardless of the central banks\u2019 expanding role, there is \nstill  debate  over  the  balance  between  monetary  and  financial  stability,  the  most  effective \nfinancial supervisory structure to adopt, and whether the trend to re-empower central banks with \nthis role is the best approach. The global trend prior to the crisis was to separate financial sector \nsupervision from the central banks\u2019 monetary policy role. Such a move is most prominently \ndisplayed with the 1997 creation of the Financial Services Authority of the United Kingdom that \nassumed financial supervision from the Bank of England. Further, the creation of the Financial \nSupervisory Service in the Republic of Korea in 1997 separated banking supervision from the \nBank of Korea. In 2013, the creation of a consolidated financial sector supervisor under the \nFinancial Services Authority in Indonesia, which removed banking supervision authority from the \ncentral bank, continued this trend. However, also in 2013, the Financial Services Authority in the \nUnited Kingdom was abolished and its responsibilities split between two new agencies: the \nFinancial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority of the Bank of England. \nThis shift to again place banking supervision under the Bank of England shows the debate over \nwhere financial supervision authority should reside continues globally, and that one solution is \nnot necessarily the best fit for all. \n \n5.  Since the global financial crisis, some trends, which have implications for central banks \nas they evolve to address new financial system challenges, have emerged: \n(i)  Central  bank  objectives  have  widened  beyond  monetary  policy  to  financial \nstability. Objectives have evolved to focus concurrently on monetary stability, \nfinancial  stability,  and  economic  growth.6 This  broader  set  of  core  functions \nbrings challenges in balancing the requirements of what can occasionally be \nconflicting objectives. \n(ii)  Central banks have taken much more of a main role in the financial system\u2019s \nfunctioning. They are at the center of the interbank market, acting not only as the \nlender of last resort, but also as a primary liquidity source to support market \nfunctioning. \n(iii)  Increased attention to financial stability has resulted in changes to central banks\u2019 \nregulatory and policy-making structures. \n(iv)  Global regulatory reforms and legal initiatives in the finance sector continue to \nchange,  causing  central  banks  to  quickly  modify  functions.  Extensive  new \nrequirements have emerged from the Basel Committee,7 the Group of Twenty \n(G20),8 and the Financial Stability Board9 that have impacted not just central \nbanks but financial systems as a whole. \n                                                \n6  This generally involves controlling inflation and money supply growth. \n7  The Basel Committee issued Basel III in December 2010 as a regulatory framework for bank capital adequacy, \nstress testing, and market liquidity risk. \n8  The G20 leaders released a statement at the Summit on Financial Markets and the World Economy on 15 \nNovember 2008 outlining root causes of the crisis, actions taken and to be taken, and common principles for \nfinancial market reform. \n9  The Financial Stability Board was established after the 2009 G20 summit in April 2009 and is an international body \nthat monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. On 14 November 2014, it issued the \nOverview of Progress in the Implementation of the G20 Recommendations for Strengthening Financial Stability: \nReport of the Financial Stability Board to G20 Leaders. Recommendations included (i) building more resilient \nfinancial institutions; (ii) ending \u201ctoo big to fail;\u201d (iii) transforming shadow banking into resilient market-based \nfinance; (iv) making derivatives markets safer; (v) creating continuous markets; (vi) improving accounting, auditing, \nand disclosures; (vii) building and implementing macroprudential frameworks and tools; and (viii) strengthening \nadherence to international financial standards. \n ", "  3 \n(v)  The level of interconnection between global financial systems and the growth of \nlarger  cross-border  financial  conglomerates  have  increased  the  need  for \ninternational cooperation and coordination among central banks and financial \nregulators. \n(vi)  Technology  has  impacted  finance  and  central  banking  materially  with  the \nemergence of new forms and mechanisms for finance. This development of new \nfinancial service approaches and market participants poses greater challenges to \ncentral banks in managing the economy and financial stability. \n \n6.  PBC anticipates a comprehensive revision of the Law on the People\u2019s Bank of China. \nReforms are being considered on the legal and institutional arrangements for financial stability, \nthe financial supervisory framework including macroprudential10 and microprudential11 policy \narrangements, lender of last resort provisions,12 and the measure regarding the resolution of \ntroubled financial institutions. The TA\u2019s goal is to understand the PBC\u2019s structuring options, \nevaluate those options, and assist the PBC in drafting a revised proposed framework with legal \nand institutional arrangements to improve its readiness to withstand and respond to future \nfinancial crises. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be improved resiliency of the financial system to withstand shocks. The \noutcome will be a strengthened governance framework concerning organizational roles and \nresponsibilities and overall authorities of the PBC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will improve the financial system\u2019s resiliency to shocks by supporting reforms to \nthe PBC\u2019s role in oversight, financial stability, and monetary policy management. ADB has \npreviously supported building a stable financial system and strengthening financial regulatory \nregimes through policy recommendations and capacity development. The proposed TA will build \non  achievements  from  previous  ADB  support  for  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  system\u2014including \ndeveloping  a  stress-testing  framework  for  the  banking  system  with  the  China  Banking \nRegulatory  Commission,  legal  system  for  the  credit  market,  and  framework  for  financial \nconsumer protection with the PBC; and building the capacity of the capital markets\u2019 regulatory \nsystem with the China Securities Regulatory Commission.13 \n \n9.  The TA will conduct an analysis of the PBC\u2019s role within the framework of financial \nsystem  supervision,  financial  stability,  and  monetary  policy  management  in  the  PRC.  The \nassessment will cover issues, gaps, and overlaps in the PBC\u2019s role in comparison with evolving \nglobal best practices in these areas as espoused by leading central banks of comparable \n                                                \n10 Generally refers to policy that aims to avoid impact to the economy by limiting the buildup of overall financial \nsystem risk. \n11 Generally refers to the supervision of individual or groups of financial institutions. \n12 Central banks serve as the lenders of last resort and provide liquidity to financial institutions that are experiencing \nfinancial difficulties. \n13 ADB. 2013.

Additionally,  practices  by  other  applicable  central  banks  and  monetary \nauthorities may be identified and assessed. The assessment will also consider developments \nand proposals from leading international financial institutions. The TA will support a study tour to \ncomparable leading central banks in ADB member countries in Europe for the PBC Legal Affairs \nDepartment  to  gain  firsthand  intelligence  and  insight  on  practical  solutions  and \nrecommendations. To obtain broad input, the TA will include a workshop with national and \ninternational resource experts and national stakeholders to gain insight, share concepts, and \npresent initial framework proposals for feedback. \n \n10.  The TA will draft recommendations to be accepted by the PBC for incorporation into a \ndraft framework proposal\u2014to be prepared by the Legal Affairs Department and approved by the \nPBC  governor,  for  presentation  to  the  Legislative  Affairs  Commission  under  the  Standing \nCommittee of the National People\u2019s Congress. The objective is for the PBC to draft integrated \nproposals on reforming its mandate and role in 2017. A policy note will also be prepared and \npublished. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $330,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, coverage of counterpart staff costs \nto attend workshops, access to data and document sources as needed, facilities for meetings \nbetween the implementing agency and consultants, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The proposed executing agency is the PBC, and the implementing agency is the PBC\u2019s \nLegal  Affairs  Department.  The  implementing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  managing \nresearch and analysis, (ii) coordinating with counterparts and stakeholders, and (iii) organizing \nthe study tour. The TA is expected to start on 30 April 2016 and end on 30 June 2017. \n \n13.  The TA will engage individually one international (4 person-months) and two national \nconsultants (8 person-months) following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time), and proceeds will be disbursed following the Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  The TA will also engage \nresource persons as needed to provide additional inputs to activities. ADB will establish an \nadvance payment facility with the executing agency to administer workshops and the study tour. \n \n14.  ADB will monitor and evaluate the TA based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed timeline and budget. ADB will assist the \nimplementing agency in overall TA operations, and will conduct TA review missions to help \nmonitor progress. To support monitoring and evaluation, consultants will submit inception, draft \nfinal, and final reports to the executing agency, implementing agency, and ADB. Results will be \ndisseminated through a workshop and a policy note. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Supporting the Reform of the Role of the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nResiliency of the financial system to withstand shocks improved (The 12th Five-year Plan for the \nDevelopment and Reform of the Financial Industry, 2011\u20132015)a  \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nA governance  Revision to the law on the  PBC reports and website  Adverse policy changes \nframework  PBC drafted by December  of the government and \nconcerning  2019 (2015 baseline:  regulatory authorities \norganizational roles  original law)  discontinue or delay \nand responsibilities  reforms \nand overall \nauthorities of the PBC \nstrengthened \nOutputs  (All baselines: NA)     \n1.
