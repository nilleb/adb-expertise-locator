The Government of the Republic of the Philippines (the Government) requested Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  explore  the  opportunities  for \nrehabilitating renewable energy projects that were implemented in the past, but which at present \nare not or are hardly operational. During the Fact-Finding Mission from 23 May to 6 June 2003, \nmeetings and discussions were held with the relevant  government organizations, research \ninstitutes, and other stakeholders in the new and renewable energy (NRE) program in the \nPhilippines.  An  understanding  was  reached  with  the  Department  of  Energy  (DOE)  on  the \nobjectives, scope, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1   The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   Despite the substantial progress in rural electrification in recent years, about 5,409 or \n18%  of  the  country\u2019s  41,999  barangays2 were  still  unelectrified  as of  February  2003.  The \nGovernment aims to have all barangays electrified by 2006.  However, 1,671 or about 30% of \nthe nonenergized barangays are beyond the vicinity of a grid or in remote areas far from the grid \nsystem.  Therefore,  the  Government  has  recognized  the  importance  of  NRE  as  means  of \ndelivering energy to populations in remote areas and islands. \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s policy is to facilitate the energy sector\u2019s transition to a sustainable \nsystem with NRE as an increasingly prominent, viable, and competitive fuel option. At the end of \n2001, the Philippines had 5,120 solar and 380 wind installations with contribution equivalent to \nabout  0.3  million  barrels  of  fuel  equivalent  (MMBFOE).  From  1999  to  2001,  about  1,000 \nbarangays were electrified using NRE technologies including solar, micro-hydro, and hybrid \nsystems. DOE has identified long-term goals to increase NRE-based capacity by 100% by 2012 \nin the next 10 years. The contribution from solar, wind, and ocean energy is expected to reach 3 \nMMBFOE in 2012. In support of the general goal, the Government will aim to (i) be the top \ngeothermal energy producer in the world; (ii) be the top wind energy producer in Southeast \nAsia;  (iii) double its hydro capacity by 2012; and (iv) expand the contribution of biomass, solar, \nmicro-hydro, and ocean by 250 megawatts. These goals serve as concrete benchmarks for the \nGovernment to advance its vision of a sustainable energy system with NRE taking a prominent \nrole in the process. \n \n4.  To implement its NRE policy, the Government through DOE has established the NRE \nprogram.  This  program  seeks  to  accelerate  the  promotion  and  commercialization  of  NRE \nsystems. The NRE program objectives are to (i) reduce poverty, (ii) enhance energy self-\nsufficiency, (iii) encourage private sector investment and participation, and (iv) reduce emissions \nby applying cleaner energy systems. To comply with the 100% electrification target in 2006, the \nGovernment has established the \u201cgift of light\u201d program. The aim of the program is to provide \nelectrification to all barangays and to provide the necessary rural infrastructure through NRE \ntechnologies.  In  particular,  1,500  barangays  are  programmed  to  be  electrified  using  NRE \nsystems.  \n \n5.  So  far,  the  implementation  of  NRE  projects  has  been  largely  supported  by  the \ndevelopment  financing  agencies  such  as  the  Global  Environment  Facility,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, World Bank, and bilateral agencies such as the Japan International \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 24 May 2003.  \n2  Barangay is the smallest local government unit equivalent to a village, normally consisting of 100 to 500 families. ", "2 \nCooperation Agency and United States Agency for International Development. These agencies \nhave  financed  various  NRE  initiatives  including  solar,  wind,  and  mini-hydro  projects.  To \nstreamline and better coordinate these initiatives, DOE is presently implementing an umbrella \nprogram  of  Capacity  Building  for  Renewable  Energy  Development  (CBRED)  in  close \ncooperation with key stakeholders. All present and future NRE projects in the Philippines will be \ncoordinated and carried out under the CBRED program. The present TA has been designed in \nconsultation  with  various  stakeholders  and is  consistent  with  the  CBRED  program  and  its \naffiliated projects. \n \n6.  Many NRE projects were carried out in the Philippines since 1970 in both public and \nprivate sectors with total investment estimated at $100 million. The project were mostly driven \nby the funding agencies and technology-based. However, about 20\u201325% of these projects were \nless  than  successful.  An  ADB-financed  rural  electrification  project3 in  early  1980s,  which \nincluded  construction  of  mini-hydro  schemes,  was  rated  partly  successful  by  the  project \nperformance audit report. Reasons for failure can be divided into the following categories: (i) \ninstitutional  problems,  including  improper  management  schemes;  (ii)  lack  of  stakeholder \nmobilization and beneficiary participation; (iii) technical problems, including lack of skill and \nspare  parts  for  operation  and  maintenance  as  well  as  technology  obsolescence;  and  (iv) \nfinancial problems, including high initial and maintenance cost, and high tariffs for consumers. \n \n7.  An increasing number of NRE projects have been successfully implemented in the \nrecent years. An important factor for this success is the close collaboration of the beneficiary \ncommunities,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  private  sector  for  the  resource \nassessment, project design, construction, management, operation, and maintenance of the \nestablished NRE systems and related livelihood activities. As NRE technology has matured over \nthe last decade, the key factors that could affect the success of the NRE projects mostly involve \ninstitutional and  social  issues.  To  ensure  productive  use  and  sustainable  operation  of  the \ninstalled  NRE  systems,  it  is  important  to  develop  a  renewable  energy-based  community \nlivelihood  opportunities,  such  as  installation  of  rice  mills  to  increase  the  value  from  rice \nproduction, mini-ice plants for cold storage of fish products, and provision of skills and training, \nidentification of potential markets, and marketing of products from such livelihood projects.  \n \n8.  Some  of  the  remote  rural  areas  earmarked  for  NRE  projects  are  likely  to  be \npredominantly  indigenous  peoples'  communities  or  indigenous  cultural  communities  (ICC) \nwhose concerns need to be carefully addressed to enhance NRE projects' compliance with \nADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples.   \n \n9.  Therefore, rehabilitation of selected NRE projects by changing these institutional set up \nand increasing participation of the beneficiary communities, NGOs, and private sector with \nlivelihood  development  would  secure  the  invested  capital  and  contribute  to  achieving  the \nGovernment\u2019s NRE policy. Lessons learned in the design, implementation, and follow-up of the \nrehabilitated  pilot  projects  can  be  applied  to  projects  in  the  Philippines  and  the  rest  of \ndeveloping Asia. This will increase the chances of successful NRE projects and will contribute to \nrural electrification and livelihood development. \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 1981.

The overall goal of the TA is to reduce poverty through the provision and efficient use of \nsustainable NRE supply, in support of livelihood systems for poor local communities in off-grid \nareas  of  the  Philippines,  within  the  framework  of  public-private-civil  society  partnerships. \nSpecifically, the purpose of the TA is to ensure the sustainability of NRE projects through pilot \ntesting rehabilitation of unsuccessful NRE projects combined with income generating livelihood \ndevelopment.  \n \n11.  The TA will result in the following outputs: (i) background study on the issues regarding \nsuccesses and failures in project design and implementation of NRE projects in the Philippines, \n(ii) rehabilitation of 2\u20133 selected NRE projects, and (iii) documentation and dissemination within \nthe  Philippines  and  to  other  developing  member  countries  with  similar  issues,  of  the \nmethodology and lessons learned.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The generic approach of the study will be a participatory one, in which the stakeholders, \ne.g., electric cooperatives, NGOs, local government units, and beneficiaries (small and medium \nsize  enterprises  and  residents)  will  have  a  crucial  role.  Feedback  from  these  groups  is \nparticularly important to identify reasons for the failure of previous NRE projects. During the \nwhole process, impacts on poverty alleviation and gender issues will be considered. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  (i)  analyze  successful  and  unsuccessful  projects  resulting  in \nrecommendations for correcting failures, (ii) implement the recommendations in demonstration \nprojects,  and  (iii)  help  the  project  recover  investments.  The  TA  will  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction by rural development and improvement in local livelihood, and will provide hands-on \nexperience that can be used for Asian developing countries facing similar issues. Accordingly, \nthe TA will be implemented in three steps: (i) identification of issues relating to the successes \nand failures in design and implementation of NRE projects in the Philippines, (ii) selection and \nrehabilitation  of  2\u20133  projects  including  livelihood  activities,  and  (iii)  documentation  and \ndissemination of methodology used and lessons learned. \n \n14.  For step (i), the following key activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  inventory and review of existing NRE projects in the Philippines on the basis of \nexisting documentation and studies, with particular attention on ICC areas or \nprojects with ICC beneficiaries; \n(ii)  field visits and consultation and workshops with electric cooperatives, NGOs  and \nend-users, including ICC representatives for selected projects; \n(iii)  classification of the projects into successful, partly successful, and unsuccessful; \nand \n(iv)  identification of general factors that contributed to the success and failures of \nNRE projects (wind, solar and photovoltaic, biomass, and micro and mini-hydro). \n \n15.  For step (ii), the following key activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  definition of criteria for selecting NRE projects to be rehabilitated; the criteria will \ninclude least-cost analysis, poverty reduction and livelihood development, public-", "4 \nprivate  partnerships,  and  operational  sustainability  (geothermal  and  large \nhydroelectric projects will be excluded); \n(ii)  selection  of  2\u20133  typical  failed  NRE  projects  in  accordance  with  the  defined \ncriteria; \n(iii)  data collection for the selected NRE projects (including the capital costs of the \ninvestment, operation and maintenance costs, number of consumers, system \nlosses,  costs  of  alternative  sources  of  energy,  and  a  demand  for  electricity \nfunction); \n(iv)  detailed  analysis  of  the  selected  projects  to  identify  specific  barriers  for \nsuccessful operation;  \n(v)  formulation  of  recommendations  and  plans  to  rehabilitate  the  selected  NRE \nprojects,  including  livelihood  developments  in  association  with  various \nstakeholders; and \n(vi)  rehabilitation of selected NRE projects with livelihood development in association \nwith relevant stakeholders, including ICC representatives (the cost of spare parts \nwill be borne by the Government and stakeholders). \n \n16.  For step (iii), the following key activities will be undertaken: \n \n(i)  documentation of the methodology used and the lessons learned, \n(ii)  preparation  of  manuals  and  guidelines  for  sustainable  development  of  NRE \nprojects, \n(iii)  dissemination of the TA results in the Philippines through national workshops, \nand \n(iv)  assessment of further financing requirements if the recommendations of the TA \nare implemented nationally. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $650,000,  including  $350,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $300,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested ADB to \nfinance  $450,000  equivalent,  covering  the  entire  foreign  exchange  costs,  and  $100,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by Danish \nCooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency in Rural Areas funded by the \nGovernment of Denmark. The Government of the Philippines will provide $200,000 equivalent \nfor office accommodation, transport, spare parts, and counterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates \nand financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  DOE will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will work in close collaboration with \nother relevant government agencies and NGOs. DOE will be responsible for implementing the \nTA and will appoint a suitably qualified professional as project coordinator.  \n \n19.  A  team  of  consultants  (18  person-months  of  domestic  and  10  person-months  of \ninternational consultancy) will be recruited to undertake the TA. The team will have expertise in \nrural  renewable  energy  and  the  aspects  of  institutional  setup,  financing,  and  sociocultural \nissues. Two international consultants, i.e., one NRE expert (6 person-months) and one project \neconomist (4 person-months), will be recruited. The international consultants will be assisted by \nthree  domestic  consultants,  including  (i)  an  NRE  expert  (6  persons-month);  (ii)  a  project \neconomist (6 person-months), and (iii) a poverty reduction and social development specialist (6 ", "    5 \nperson-months). The consultants will be engaged by ADB through a firm using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The simplified \ntechnical proposal format will be used. Equipment for use by the consultants will be procured \nin accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n20.  The  consultants  will  submit  short  monthly  progress  reports  summarizing  TA \nactivities, issues, and constraints for the duration of the TA. In addition, four major reports \nwill be submitted: an inception report within 1 month from TA commencement, an interim report \nof TA progress within 8 months, a draft final report within 16 months, and a final report toward \nthe end of the TA.  After receiving the inception report, ADB will undertake an inception mission \nto discuss and agree with DOE and the consultants on the milestones of TA implementation. A \nTA review mission will be fielded after receipt of the interim report to monitor the progress of TA \nimplementation and make necessary adjustments. A tripartite meeting will be held among DOE, \nthe consultants, and ADB to discuss the draft final report. The final report will be prepared by \nthe consultants within 15 days after the tripartite meeting has taken place. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented during an 18-month period, and is expected to commence in \nDecember 2003 and be completed by June 2005.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 to the Government \nof the Philippines to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Denmark's Danish \nCooperation  Fund  for  Renewable  Energy  and  Energy  Efficiency  in  Rural  Areas  for  the \nRehabilitation  of  Renewable  Energy  Projects  for  Rural  Electrification  and  Livelihood \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
