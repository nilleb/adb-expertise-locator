INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Tuvalu expressed a need for technical assistance (TA) in 2011 to \nsupport its fiscal stability and capacity-improving initiatives.1 The TA will address priority areas \nof  weaknesses  identified  in  the  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA) \nassessment and the diagnostic analysis of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development \n(MFED) report. It will also assist the government implement the Public Enterprise (Accountability \nand Transparency) Act 2009. The TA will also assist the government to achieve some of the \npolicy  actions  identified  in  the  government  policy  reform  matrix.  Improving  public  financial \nmanagement  (PFM)  and  public  enterprise  performance  is  a  priority  area  in  the  national \ndevelopment strategy (Te Kakeega II)2 and ADB's country partnership strategy.3 \n \n2.  A  TA  fact-finding  mission  visited  Tuvalu  on  12\u201317  April  2012.  It  reached  an \nunderstanding  in  discussions  with  the  government  and  other  stakeholders  on  the  impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consulting services. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Tuvalu relies heavily on its public sector as the driver of growth, however the sector is \ninefficient and unwieldy. Tuvalu is in a unique situation whereby external earnings are twice its \ngross domestic product (GDP), leaving the country open to global forces. Since 2008 Tuvalu \nhas experienced a decline in key offshore revenues because (i) earnings from fish licenses \nhave declined significantly due to low catch in its exclusive economic zone as a result of climatic \nconditions, (ii) the returns on its \u201c.tv\u201d domain name have fallen, and (iii) returns from the Tuvalu \nTrust Fund (TTF) have fallen below their targeted level. More recently, the value of external \nearnings denominated in United States dollars have declined significantly because of exchange \nrate movements.  \n \n4.  Total revenues and grants for 2011 were slightly below budget but about 20% higher \nthan in 2010. The increase was mainly due to grants. Government expenditure fell by more than \n7% as subsidies were reduced and spending on capital projects declined. These developments \nled to a reduction in the fiscal deficit from more than 30% of GDP in 2010 to about 8% in 2011. \nThe market value of the TTF was A$115.1 million at 30 September 2011. This was 9.7% below \nits prescribed maintained value and, as such, no funds were distributed from the TTF into the \nConsolidated Investment Fund (CIF)\u2014the vehicle through which budget deficits are financed. \nThe CIF held A$3.1 million in December 2011 and, given the expected deficit, is likely to be \nexhausted in 2012. Further distribution from TTF earnings is not expected until 2014.\u00a0 Total \ngovernment debt was estimated at 44.3% of GDP in 2010, and may be higher with the status of \ncontingent liabilities from joint-venture fishing companies to be determined. Tuvalu is now facing \nunsustainable fiscal pressures. \n \n5.  The government owns eight public enterprises, which operate in key sectors of the \neconomy.5 In 2008, with ADB technical assistance (TA),6 the government put in place the Public \n                                                 \n1  This TA is in conjunction with the Strengthened Public Financial Management program grant scheduled for \napproval  in September 2012.  \n2  Government of Tuvalu. 2005.

Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 June 2012. \n5  These enterprises are the Development Bank of Tuvalu, the National Bank of Tuvalu, the National Fishing \nCorporation of Tuvalu, the National Provident Fund, the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute, the Tuvalu Philatelic \n ", "2 \n \nEnterprise (Accountability and Transparency) Act 2009. The act provides overarching legislation \nthat specifies both the requirements of public enterprises and government responsibilities in \nrelation to public enterprises. Prior to this, each public enterprise was governed by its own \nindividual act of incorporation. In line with the Public Enterprise Act, the Public Enterprise \nReform  and  Monitoring  Unit  (PERMU)  was  formed,  and  was  empowered  to  monitor  the \nperformance of all public enterprises on behalf of the shareholding ministers, and to advise \nthese ministers in respect of the government\u2019s investment in public enterprises. This provides a \ncoordinated approach to monitoring public enterprise performance. One of the achievements of \nthe  act  is  the  legislating  of  community  service  obligations  (CSOs).  Under  the  act,  the \ngovernment will have to pay CSOs if it wants public enterprises to provide a service to the \ncommunity which is not commercially viable.  \n \n6.  A diagnostic analysis of the MFED was also made under the TA. The analysis identified \na number of performance gaps, including (i) a lack of achievable measurable indicators within \nMFED programs; (ii) a lack of clarity of job descriptions; and (iii) a mismatch between expected \nresults and resources, restricting the effectiveness of the MFED in executing and monitoring the \nbudget  and  resource  allocation.  These  issues  were  clearly  highlighted  in  the  2011  PEFA \nassessment,  where  it  was  noted  that  both  fiscal  discipline  and  the  strategic  allocation  of \nresources had been undermined due to weaknesses in PFM. The PEFA report also pointed out \nthat  efficiency  of  service  delivery  is  constrained  by  the  lack  of  a  procurement  regulatory \nframework. \n \n7.  The  Public  Tenders  Board  (PTB)  Regulations  (2008  revised  edition),  made  under \nsection 5 of the Public Finance Act, are the only laws governing procurement in Tuvalu. This \nlegislation is very brief and does not provide for many of the elements of a rigorous procurement \nsystem. The regulations establish a PTB comprising five members, whose functions are to put \nto tender building work not undertaken by the Public Works Department7 and any major disposal \nof government property. In relation to building works, the MFED has the power to direct the PTB \nto enter into direct negotiations with a selected contractor for completion of a particular project. \nThe regulations do not cover procurement of goods and services and do not provide for either \nthe  public  release  of  information  relating  to  procurement  or  a  complaints  review  process. \nProcurement of goods and services is left to individual ministries to handle, and some ministries \nhave established their own procedures while others use \u201cestablished suppliers\u201d that they have \ndealt with on a regular basis. The underlying aim of developing suitable public procurement \npolicy procedures and rules is to ensure that the Government of Tuvalu obtains value for money \nfrom its public procurement and processes are cost-effective to implement, recognizing that the \neconomy is small and there are limited private sector providers.   \n \n8.  The Pacific Financial and Technical Assistance Center will assist the government to put \ntogether  a  PFM  plan,  with  the  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID) \nproviding  consultants  to  build  capacity  at  the  auditor  general\u2019s  office  and  the  Treasury \nDepartment.  In  addition,  development  partners  (ADB,  AusAID,  the  European  Union,  New \nZealand, and the World Bank) and the government are working on a joint policy reform matrix \nthat will identify government priority needs in the medium term, and which will be used to \ncoordinate planned budget support.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \nBureau, Tuvalu Telecommunication Corporation, and the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel. The Tuvalu Media Corporation has \nbeen decorporatized. While Parliament has approved the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (TEC) repeal Act to \ndecorporatize TEC, the Minister has yet to sign it into effect. TEC is currently operating as a PE. \n6  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Tuvalu for Capacity Development for Public Financial Management.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The intended impact of the TA is improved PFM and public enterprise performance, as \nprioritized in Te Kakeega II. The impact will be monitored through demonstrated improvements \nin the 2014 country performance assessment on the ratings for macroeconomic management \nand fiscal policy. The expected outcome is improved internal corporate planning processes in \nthe MFED and strengthened public enterprise oversight. Achievement of the expected outcome \nwill be reflected in the government\u2019s capacity to achieve the policy changes it has committed to \nin the joint policy reform matrix.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will directly respond to the government\u2019s strategic area of good governance \nidentified in Te Kakeega II where it gives priority to (i) strengthening public administration \noversight; (ii) institutionalizing sound management, principles, and practices in the public service; \nand (iii) reducing subsidies to public enterprises through improved management, operations, \nand business planning.8 ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (footnote 3) also focuses on these \nareas, as poor expenditure allocation decisions have significant opportunity costs that impede \ndevelopment and growth in a micro-economy such as Tuvalu.  \n \n11.  Output  1:  Improved  human  resource  reform  in  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and \nEconomic Development. Under the TA, the findings of the diagnostic analysis and the PEFA \nassessment will be reviewed to determine the steps the government has taken to reduce or \neliminate the performance gaps identified. Building on this review, the TA consultants will work \nclosely with MFED headquarters to develop an appropriate corporate plan for the MFED that will \nprovide direction and guidance to all MFED departments and, among other things, (i) establish \nspecific, measurable, and achievable key performance targets and outputs with appropriate \nindicators; (ii) improve budget credibility; and (iii) improve budget monitoring and resource \nallocation. The MFED\u2019s corporate plan will form the basis for the formulation of its departmental \ncorporate plans. In putting together the MFED's corporate plan, the consultants will consider the \nPFM plan and Te Kakeega II priorities. The TA consultants will also review and update the \nMFED\u2019s job descriptions and establish a simple performance assessment system. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Capacity  development  plan  for  the  Public  Enterprise  Reform  and \nMonitoring Unit fully implemented. The TA will also review the implementation of the Public \nEnterprise  Act  to  identify  areas  that  require  strengthening.  Based  on  this  review,  the  TA \nconsultants will develop a capacity building strategy to build the PERMU's understanding of its \nrole under the Public Enterprise Act. In developing the strategy, the TA consultants will consider \nCSO  calculations  and  negotiations,  financial  reporting  requirements,  and  public  enterprise \ncorporate planning for directors of the PERMU and public enterprises. \n \n13.  Output 3: Procurement policy approved by cabinet. The TA consultants will review \nexisting government rules and practices for procurement of goods, works, and services by the \npublic sector and build into the PTB Regulations (2008 revised edition) a set of procedures for \nthis. The set of procedures should (i) ensure that open competitive procurement is the default \nmethod of procurement, but define clearly the situations in which other methods may be used \n                                                 \n8  This is particularly crucial and rather difficult to implement in a fragile situation such as exists in Tuvalu. \n ", "4 \n \nand how this is to be justified; (ii) provide for public access to all government procurement plans, \nbidding opportunities, and contract awards; and (iii) provide for an independent administrative \nprocurement review process for handling complaints by participants prior to contract signing and \nensuring that those making procurement decisions are accountable for them. The consultants \nwill also identify the merits of various options, including the engagement of an independent third \nparty to manage government procurement and having a central procurement unit for a small \nadministration such as Tuvalu. \n \n14.  Given the high budget expenditures from previous years and the financial difficulty the \ngovernment is facing, the TA is being formulated on the assumption that the government will \ncontinue to commit to strengthening PFM and public enterprise performance, as stated in Te \nKakeega II. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $380,400, of which $80,400 will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Australia and administered by ADB, and $300,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  The  government  will \nprovide support in kind in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, communication \nfacilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The MFED will be the executing agency, and will appoint a TA focal point who will \noversee the activities of, and maintain information exchange with, the consultant team. The \nconsultants will, with the TA focal point, also liaise with development partners to promote \ncoordination and complementarity in program and/or project activities. To promote sustainability \nand broad-based commitment to the direction of reforms and guide TA implementation, the TA \nwill make use of the steering committee formed under ADB\u2019s TA on Capacity Development for \nPublic Financial Management (footnote 6) comprising officials from the MFED, line ministries, \nand representatives from nongovernment organizations and the private sector and chaired by \nthe secretary of finance. \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 12-month period from 1 August 2012 to 30 July 2013 \nand will finance 12.5 person-months of intermittent international consulting services and 5 \nperson-months of national consulting services. The international consultant\u2019s team will comprise \n(i)  a  team  leader  and  strategic  planning  and  human  resource  management  specialist \n(international, 6 person-months); (ii) a public enterprise specialist (international, 3.5 person-\nmonths); and (iii) a procurement specialist (international, 3 person-months). These specialists \nwill be joined by a local project facilitation specialist (national, 5 person-months intermittent). \nThe consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis and according to ADB \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The proceeds of \nthe TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n ", "5 \n \n18.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons learned, and next steps. Throughout the TA, the team leader will submit (by email) brief \nmonthly progress reports summarizing TA activities, progress, issues, and constraints. Team \nmembers will produce reports on their respective activities for the team leader's progress and \nfinal reports. The team leader's final report will be submitted in draft form at least 5 weeks prior \nto the end of the assignment, and the final report within 2 weeks of receipt of comments by the \ngovernment and ADB. \n \n19.  Progress of the TA will be monitored using intended outcomes and outputs described in \nthe design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). ADB will assist the government in sharing \nall reports with other development partners. These will be disseminated through meetings, radio \ninterviews, and the ADB website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $80,400 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Tuvalu for \nInstitutional Strengthening of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved PFM and  Demonstrated improvement in  2014 CPA  Continued government \npublic enterprise   2014 country performance    commitment to reforms at \nperformance  assessment scores on (i)    the political bureaucratic \neconomic management to 3.0    level \n(2011 baseline: 2.7%), and (ii)     \nD13 \u2013 quality of budgetary and    Risk \nfinancial management to 3.3    Expenditures inconsistent \n(2011 baseline: 3.0)    with budgets \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved internal  Costed MFED corporate plan  Budget papers  Continued government \ncorporate planning  approved with activities reflected    commitment to \nprocesses in  in 2013 budget    implementation of the \nMFED and      Public Enterprise Act \nstrengthened  Public enterprise corporate  MFED report  2009  \npublic enterprise  plans submitted to shareholding     \noversight  ministers, auditor general, and    Risk \n  secretary of finance before start    Lack of capacity within \n  of financial year    the office of the auditor \n    general to conduct audits \nPublic enterprise annual reports  Auditor general\u2019s  of public enterprises \nand audited accounts submitted  report   \n4 months after end of financial   \nyear   \nOutputs       Assumption \n1.

Consultant services will support this technical assistance (TA). A team leader, who will \nalso be a strategic planning and human resources management specialist, will be in charge of \nsupervising all consultants and lead the work of the TA. It is expected that the consultants will \nwork closely to keep the implementation of the TA on track and in line with its scope and \nobjectives. \n \n2.  The TA will be implemented intermittently by a team of three international consultants for \na  total  of  12.5  person-months  and  one  national  consultant  for  5  person-months.  The \ninternational consultant\u2019s team will comprise a team leader and strategic planning and human \nresources management specialist (international, 6 person-months); a public enterprise specialist \n(international,  3.5  person-months);  and  a  procurement  specialist  (international,  3  person-\nmonths). These specialists will be joined by a local project facilitation specialist (national, 5 \nperson-months intermittent). \n \n1.  Team Leader and Strategic Planning and Human Resources Management \nSpecialist (international, 6 person-months) \n \n3.  The specialist must have the appropriate background to undertake the task as outlined in \npara. 5 but should in addition be able to act as an efficient and effective agent of change. This \nperson  must  also  possess  excellent  capacity  development  and  workshop  preparation  and \ndelivery skills, as well as coaching and mentoring skills, to help the Ministry of Finance and \nEconomic Planning (MFED) implement the tasks described in paras. 4 and 5. She or he must \nhave a broad human resources background and understanding of how to link strategic planning \nand human resources management. She or he must have extensive international experience, \nparticularly in the Pacific region, and be adept at applying lessons in reforms in fragile island \nmicro-states. \n \n4.  The specialist will take the lead in reviewing the final report of the participatory diagnostic \nanalysis of the MFED and the public expenditure and financial accountability assessment.
