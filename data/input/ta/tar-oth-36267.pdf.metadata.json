Dust and sandstorm (DSS) is the generic term for a serious environmental phenomenon \nin Northeast Asia. DSS involves strong winds that blow a large quantity of dust and fine sand \nparticles away from the ground and carry them over a long distance with severe environmental \nimpacts along the way, and often with severe impacts across the countries in the region. The \nmajor sources of DSS in the region are the desert and semidesert areas of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) and Mongolia (DSS originating source areas). To address the long-\nrange transboundary environmental problem of DSS, a regional cooperation mechanism must \nbe established among the countries in the region so that the problem can be addressed in a \ncoordinated manner. At the request of the governments of the PRC and Mongolia, in early May \n2002 the Asian Development Bank (ADB) started to prepare a regional technical assistance \n(TA) for prevention and control of dust and sandstorm in Northeast Asia.1 In parallel, three \nagencies  of  the  United  Nations\u2014United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP),  United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (ESCAP), and United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification Secretariat (UNCCD)\u2014initiated a similar project proposal \nto seek support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to address the same environmental \nproblem in the region.  \n \n2.  To integrate the support from the international community and maximize its effects, at a \nmeeting among the environment ministries of PRC, Japan, Republic of Korea, and Mongolia in \nJune 2002, the governments of the four countries proposed that ADB, ESCAP, UNCCD, and \nUNEP jointly develop an expanded and integrated TA to promote regional cooperation on DSS \nto  be  cofinanced  by  GEF.  A  joint  fact-finding  and  consultation  mission  comprising \nrepresentatives from ADB, ESCAP, UNCCD, and UNEP and led by ADB visited PRC and \nMongolia from 26 August to 2 September 2002. The mission reached an understanding with the \ngovernments of PRC and Mongolia on all aspects of the TA including the goals, purpose, scope, \nimplementation arrangement, cost estimates, financing plan, and terms of reference. The TA \nframework is provided at Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  DSS as a natural phenomenon has occurred for thousands of years in the region. During \nthe past 50 years, however, the frequency has increased, geographic coverage has expanded, \nand  damage  intensity  has  accelerated.  PRC  statistics  available  indicate  that  average \noccurrence of DSS was 5 times a year in 1950s, 8 times in 1960s, 14 times in 1970s, and 23 \ntimes in 1990s. The region experienced 32 DSS in 2001, and the most severe DSS for decades \nin early 2002.  \n \n4.  Large-scale DSS has significant environment effects that cause enormous economic \nlosses, present serious public health concerns over a wide geographic area, and, sometimes \ntake human life. For instance, the DSS on 5 May 1993 directly affected 1.1 million square \nkilometers in the PRC, which resulted in 85 dead, 246 injured, 4,412 houses destroyed, 120,000 \nlivestock dead or lost, and 373,000 hectares of crop land damaged. The direct economic cost of \nthis DSS within the PRC alone was more than CNY550 million (about $66 million at the current \nexchange rate). The two most severe DSSs in decades took place in March and April 2002. \nThey swept across Mongolia and hit 18 provinces in PRC, the Korean Peninsula, and a large \narea of Japan. Total suspended particulate levels in these affected areas were recorded from \ntens to hundreds of times higher than the national standards in these countries. The DSS in \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 13 June 2002. \n ", "2    \nearly April was so severe that Mongolia had to close its international airport in Ulaanbaatar for 3 \ndays, and the Republic of Korea had to close primary schools and cancel more than 40 flights \ndeparting from Kimpo Airport in Seoul.  Satellite images of DSSs and analysis of the dust \nsamples collected on the ground have revealed that impacts of strong DSSs are not limited to \nthe region, but reach as far as North America across the Pacific Ocean. \n \n5.  A preliminary study indicates that 18 of the 32 DSSs in 2001 originated from the deserts \nof Mongolia, and the remaining 14 originated from the desert or semidesert areas of Inner \nMongolia Autonomous Region, the PRC. Natural elements, large desert and semidesert areas, \nthe strong winds from Siberia sweeping these DSS originating source areas, lasting drought, \nnatural disasters, and other factors contribute to DSS. Their effects have been strengthened \nand  intensified  significantly,  however,  by  human  interventions  over  the  last  few  decades, \nparticularly through overgrazing, overreclamation, deforestation, and overexploitation of water \nresources in the DSS originating source areas, which lead to rapid land degradation and \ndesertification. Although all the countries in the region are affected by DSS, effective actions are \nurgently  needed  in  the  DSS  originating  source  areas  in  PRC  and  Mongolia  to  arrest \ndeterioration of the land, before the situation becomes irreversible.   \n \n6.  The governments of PRC and Mongolia have formulated comprehensive programs to \ncombat land degradation and desertification, which serve as their main thrust to alleviate DSS. \nWith support from ESCAP, UNCCD, and UNEP, PRC and Mongolia have developed their \nnational  action  programs  to  combat  desertification.  In  early  2002,  the  PRC  Government \nannounced a 10 year program with a total investment of CNY54 billion (about $6.5 billion) to \naddress the DSS concern in the northern PRC. With support of ADB, the PRC Government has \nalso established a partnership with GEF for an overall program on land degradation in dryland \necosystems.  However,  the  linkage  of  these  national  initiatives  to  the  regional  concern  of \ntransboundary DSS is yet to be established through cooperation beyond national borders. \nWithout an effective policy and coordination at a regional level, the effectiveness of the national \ninitiatives will be limited. \n \n7.  The intensified transboundary DSS has mobilized very strong public will for regional \ncooperation on combating DSS, particularly in the DSS-affected areas, where hundreds of \nmillions of people have been exposed to the impacts of DSS on living standards, public health, \nand economic wealth. In addition to various initiatives of the governments, nongovernment \norganizations and volunteers from the DSS-affected countries have been actively undertaking \ncross-border activities to mitigate DSSs (e.g., planting trees in the DSS originating source \nareas), but in a sporadic and uncoordinated manner. Regional cooperation will maximize the \neffects of the initiatives from the private sector and civil societies in the affected countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n8.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  promote  establishment  of  a  regional  cooperation \nmechanism for prevention and control of DSS and to facilitate cooperation for and coordination \namong interventions by the major stakeholders of the region.  \n \n9.  The main outputs of the TA will include (i) an initial regional institutional framework that \nwill enable international policy and operational coordination among the major DSS stakeholders \nat  a  regional  level,  and  (ii)  a  regional  master  plan  for  alleviating  DSS,  based  on  a \ncomprehensive assessment of scientific findings. The master plan will include, inter alia, (i) a ", "      3 \nphased program for establishing a regional monitoring and early warning network for DSS, and \n(ii) an investment strategy including recommendations on sustainable financing mechanisms \nand identification of eight priority demonstration projects to disseminate the best practices in \naddressing the causes of DSS: four in the PRC and four in Mongolia. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in the context of the ongoing joint efforts of the major DSS \nstakeholders in the region, including the governments of PRC, Japan, Republic of Korea, and \nMongolia; and four international institutions: ADB, ESCAP, UNCCD, and UNEP. These four \ngovernments and four institutions will be collectively referred to as the participating parties. The \nkey activities under the TA fall into two major components, one for initiating an institutional \nframework for regional cooperation on DSS, and the other for developing a master plan for \nregional cooperation on alleviating DSS. \n \n11.  Initiating the framework. To initiate an institutional framework for regional cooperation \non DSS, the participating parties will form a steering committee to be cochaired by PRC and \nMongolia. The committee will provide overall guidance for implementation of the TA. Under the \nsteering committee, the participating parties will set up three technical committees: one for \npromoting a regional cooperation mechanism, to be chaired by UNCCD; one for preparing a \nphased program to establish a regional monitoring and early warning network for DSS and a \ncomprehensive assessment of scientific findings, to be chaired by UNEP; and one for preparing \nan investment strategy for mitigation measures in DSS originating source areas, to be chaired \nby ESCAP. The membership of the technical committees will be open to all the participating \nparties, and other countries and institutions that can contribute, technically or financially, to \nalleviating DSS in the region. \n \n12.  By involving DSS-affected countries and international institutions in the initial regional \ncooperation mechanism, the TA will help establish a standardized DSS monitoring and early \nwarning system in the region covering both DSS-originating and DSS-affected countries. The \nTA will also help mobilize technical, financial, and operational supports from the DSS-affected \ncountries, international institutions, and other stakeholders to supplement the mitigation actions \nthat have been, and will be, undertaken by the PRC and Mongolia in the DSS originating source \nareas.  The  initial  framework  will  provide  a  forum  and  enabling  mechanism  for  these \nstakeholders to develop a more permanent institutional structure for regional cooperation on \nDSS that will sustain beyond the implementation period of the TA. \n \n13.  The  major  activities  under  this  component  will  include  (i)  setting  up  the  steering \ncommittee and organizing up to four plenary sessions of the steering committee for policy \nconsultation  and  decision  making,  (ii)  establishing  the  three  technical  committees  and \norganizing up to four plenary sessions of each technical committee to provide technical advice \nand guidance, (iii) setting up a project secretariat under the guidance of the steering committee \nto provide operational coordination and administrative support to facilitate TA implementation, \n(iv) establishing and maintaining a computerized data bank for DSS for the participating parties, \nand (v) launching and operating a public awareness program through a project website and \nmultimedia presentation to strengthen public awareness of the DSS and mobilize public support \nfor alleviating DSS. \n \n14.  Developing a Master Plan. The master plan for regional cooperation on alleviating DSS \nwill be developed through participatory consultation. Specific components of the draft master \nplan will be reviewed and cleared by the relevant technical committees and approved by the \n ", "4    \nsteering committee. Public participation will be facilitated through design workshops and a \nspecial web site under the public awareness program. The preparation of the phased program \nfor  establishing  a  regional  monitoring  and  early  warning  network  for  DSS  will  include  (i) \norganizing an international workshop for a review of the national monitoring and early warning \nsystem to identify the issues that need to be addressed in developing the program, (ii) providing \na team of consultants to develop the draft program, (iii) organizing two design workshops for \ntechnical review and participatory design process, and (iv) undertaking official survey and site \nvisits to selected DSS monitoring facilities. \n \n15.  For preparing the master plan and investment strategy, emphasis will be placed on \nexamining innovative financing mechanisms to mobilize continued support from public and \nprivate stakeholders and civil society to strengthen the sustainability of the regional cooperation \non combating DSS.  In designing the investment strategy, special emphasis will be placed on \ndisseminating  the  best  practices  that  can  offer  environment-friendly  jobs  to  improve  the \nlivelihood of people in the DSS originating source area. This will be done by introducing and \npromoting the successful demonstration projects that have both poverty reduction and DSS \nmitigation effects. The major activities will include (i) providing a team of consultants to draft a \nmaster plan and an investment strategy; (ii) organizing two design workshops to present the \nbest practices and to enable a technical review and participatory design process; (iii) organizing \nsite visits of the officials concerned to selected pilot antidesertification projects in the DSS \noriginating source areas, to identify the best practices and suitable demonstration projects; and \n(iv)  inviting  international  experts  as  resource  persons  to  present  at  the  workshops  best \ninternational practices for technology transfer and experience sharing.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.215 million equivalent, comprising $745,000 in foreign \nexchange  and  $470,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  ADB  will  provide  $500,000 \nequivalent to cover $426,400 of the foreign exchange cost and $73,600 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by \nthe Government of Japan. The TA will be cofinanced by GEF on a grant basis in the amount of \n$500,000 equivalent to cover $318,600 of the foreign exchange cost and $181,400 of the local \ncurrency cost. The governments of PRC and Mongolia will finance $125,000 equivalent and \n$90,000 equivalent, respectively, to cover the in-kind expenditures for counterpart support \nservices and office space and office facilities occurred in their countries. Appendix 2 provides \nthe details of the cost estimates and financing arrangements. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over an 18 month period from January 2003 to June 2004. \nADB will be the Executing Agency, responsible for overall management and administration of \nthe TA. The TA  will be implemented in cooperation with ESCAP, UNCCD, and UNEP. UNEP, \nwhich serves as the GEF implementing agency for the GEF cofinancing resources, will chair the \ntechnical committee for developing a program for establishing a regional monitoring and early \nwarning  network  for  DSS  and  comprehensively  assessing  the  scientific  findings.  In  this \nconnection, UNEP will provide 12 person-months of professional services and office space, free \nof charge, as its in-kind contribution to the TA. ESCAP, which serves as a coexecuting agency \nfor technical coordination, will chair the technical committee for developing an investment \nstrategy.  ESCAP  will  provide  10  person-months  of  professional  services  as  its  in-kind \ncontribution. In cooperation with UNCCD, the TA will establish a project secretariat to provide \noperational  and  administrative  support  for  the  steering  committee  and  ADB  as  Executing ", "      5 \nAgency. In this connection, UNCCD will provide 18 person-months of professional services and \noffice space, free of charge, for the project secretariat. All the three agencies of the United \nNations\u2014 UNCCD, UNEP, and UNESCAP\u2014will endeavor to mobilize, with their influence and \nexpertise, supplementary technical and financial resources to support the TA.  \n \n18.  The PRC Government has designated its State Development Planning Commission as \nthe national coordination agency for the TA. The PRC Government will establish a multiagency \nworking group including representatives from the State Development Planning Commission, \nMinistry  of  Finance,  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration,  and  State  Forestry \nAdministration to guide and support the TA. The Government of Mongolia has designated the \nMinistry of Nature and Environment as the national coordination agency for the TA. The \nGovernment  of  Mongolia  will  also  establish  a  multiagency  working  group  including \nrepresentatives from the Ministry of Nature and Environment, Ministry of Finance and Economy, \nand other concerned agencies to guide and support the TA. \n \n19.  The TA will require about 11 person-months of international consulting services in policy \nand strategic planning, DSS monitoring and mitigation, antidesertification, and international \ninvestment. The TA will require about 42 person-months of domestic consulting services from \nPRC and Mongolia in strategic planning, DSS ground monitoring, remote sensing, sandy land \nrevegetation, and environmental management. All consultants will be selected and engaged by \nADB as individuals in accordance with its  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of \nreference of the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The project secretariat will launch and operate an Internet web site to disseminate \ninformation about the TA to the general public. The master plan for regional cooperation on DSS \nand the major findings and recommendations of the research and studies conducted by the \nconsultants under the TA will be published by the end of implementation period. \n \nIV.
