I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan of up to $23,000,000 or its lari equivalent to Credo Microfinance Organization (Credo); (ii) a \nproposed loan of up to $7,000,000 or its lari equivalent to FINCA Bank Georgia (FBG); and (iii) \nproposed loans to TBC Bank (TBC) consisting of (a) a subordinated loan of up to $50,000,000 \nor its euro equivalent or its lari equivalent, and (b) a senior loan of up to $50,000,000 or its euro \nequivalent or its lari equivalent, for the Financial Inclusion for Micro and Small Business Growth \nin Georgia. The report also describes technical assistance (TA) of up to $1,050,000 for Financial \nInclusion for Micro and Small Business Growth in Georgia, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n2.  Although real gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an annual average of 5.8% from \n2010 to 2014, Georgia is exposed to high market volatility because of its small market size; \ndependence  on  imports  of  goods  and  capital,  as  well  as  remittances;  and  exposure  to \nfluctuating demand from its trade partners. The current recession and political instability in the \nRussian  Federation  and  Ukraine,  coupled  with  the  economic  volatility  of  South  Caucasus \ncountries, have lowered Georgia\u2019s 2015 growth target to 2%. As a result of the trade deficit and \nreduced foreign currency inflows, the lari depreciated by 36% against the dollar in the market \nfrom October 2014 to October 2015. This depreciation stands in contrast to the stability of the \nlari during 2012 \u2013 2014 and threatens the use of lari. The share of deposits denominated in \nforeign currency was 66% in March 2015. Reducing the dollarization of the economy, a long-\nterm objective of the government, is essential for reducing market risks. \n \n3.  Although 43% of Georgians live in rural areas and 27% live in regional towns, these \nregions contribute only 28% to business turnover.2 As 75% of farms engage in subsistence \nfarming, agriculture contributes only 10% of GDP (2014). About 23% are small family farms \nbetween 1 hectare and 5 hectares, providing limited opportunities for serving urban markets; \nonly 11,200 or 2% of farms have the scale for commercial operations. Hence, many self-\nemployed farmers are trapped in low-productivity farms, which explains the high rural poverty \nheadcount  of  27.1%  (2013).  However,  agriculture\u2019s  potential  for  income  and  employment \ngeneration is large. Georgia benefits from diverse climate zones, which provide opportunities for \nexport expansion and import substitution. Improving infrastructure, storage, processing and the \nquality of products requires capital, but only 4.4% of business loans go to agriculture. \n \n4.  Georgia has only about 40,000 active enterprises. Its unrecorded economy is estimated \nat 14% of GDP (2014). About 2,100 small and medium-sized companies employ the bulk of the \nenterprise workforce (57%), or 20% of the total workforce. Since 2010, annual employment \ngrowth in such entities has averaged 9.8%\u2014far outpacing smaller units, which grew at only \n4.1% per year. However, low-productivity sectors, such as wholesale, retail, construction and \nservices,  generate  75%  of  value-added  output  in  2014.  A World  Economic  Forum  survey \nidentified the major obstacles to business growth as inadequately qualified management and \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  National Statistical Office Georgia. Preliminary Results of the Census 2014, and GeoStat Database. \nhttp://www.geostat.ge/?action=page&p_id=32&lang=eng. (accessed 16 June 2015). \n ", "2 \n \nworkforce and limited access to finance. Although the regulatory framework of the finance \nsector is robust, the penetration of banking is low by international standards, pointing to the \nneed for leaner, business-friendly lending processes.3 On the demand side, many clients are \nunable to articulate their business plans and improve their marketing and staff performance. \n \n5.  Despite recent efforts to revive agriculture and improve the income of the poor through \nsocial transfer programs, 21% of Georgians lived below the national poverty line in 2013.4 \nGeorgia  relies  heavily  on  private  investments  to  maintain  and  generate  employment  and \ndepends on the finance sector to fund its investment and working capital needs. With the \ncontinued high incidence of poverty in rural regions and secondary towns, a dual-track approach \nis needed to simultaneously (i) boost microbusinesses and farmers in order to stabilize incomes \nof the poor and (ii) help small businesses become the drivers of income and employment.  \n \n6.  Finance sector assets totaled GEL22.2 billion or 71% of GDP in 2014. Banks held 93.2% \nof the assets, dwarfing nonbank financial institutions (6.8%). From 2010 to 2014, the compound \nannual growth rate (CAGR) of bank loans to the private sector was 19.8%. The depth of the \nfinancial system also improved, with private sector credit increasing from 29.3% of GDP to \n43.6% from 2010 to 2014.5 However, the high share of retail credit (50%) obscures the modest \npenetration of private enterprise credit, which is equivalent to only 20% of GDP. The market is \nconcentrated in Tbilisi, which receives 78% of loans. Although services to the  regions are \nimproving, many small businesses and farms remain underserved. \n \n7.  The bank regulatory framework has helped improve the sector\u2019s resilience since 2009.6 \nInternal capital adequacy assessment programs, supported by ongoing TA financed from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  became  mandatory  for  banks  in  2014  and  include \nimprovement of the banks\u2019 forecasting and regulatory oversight. As Georgia is moving towards \nBasel III capital adequacy regulation in 2018, cyclical buffers for market volatility and structural \nbuffers for three systemically important banks (including TBC), as well as the alignment of \nInternational Financial Reporting Standards  and national accounting standards are expected.. \nBanking regulation is conservative compared with regional peers and includes higher capital \nsurcharges  and  liquidity  reserves  for  foreign  currency  loans  and  deposits,  especially  of \nnonresidents.7  \n \n8.  The differential between loans and deposits priced in local and foreign currencies has \nincreased  since  2012,  because  of  the  higher  demand  for  lari  during  the  period  of  stable \nexchange  rates  that  ended  in  October  2014.  Since  March  2014,  international  financial \ninstitutions (IFIs), including ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and \nthe International Finance Corporation issued lari-denominated bonds, supported by the National \nBank of Georgia (NBG) and the government. The recent large depreciation in the market has \nresulted in higher dollarization and limits banks\u2019 ability to lend in lari. \n \n                                                \n3   World Economic Forum. 2014. Global Competitiveness Report. Geneva \n4  The relative poverty line is equal to 60% of the median consumption. \n5  National Statistics Office of Georgia. Georgia Statistics Database. \nhttp://www.geostat.ge/?action=page&p_id=32&lang=eng. (accessed 1 June 2015). \n6  The International Monetary Fund concluded its Financial Sector Assessment Program and Financial Sector \nStability Assessment in October 2014, acknowledging substantial improvements in bank regulation and supervision \nby the National Bank of Georgia (NBG). \n7  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Promoting Financial Sector Resilience. Manila. ", "3 \n9.  Since 2007, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has been active in Georgia\u2019s \nfinance sector by providing loans to banks that have primarily supported small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs) in the capital. To improve outreach to the regions (outside the capital) \nand diversify risk, ADB provided a loan and TA to TBC in 2013, which\u2014backed by ADB\u2019s first \nlari bond issue\u2014was converted into a lari loan in February 2015.8 TBC\u2019s full integration of Bank \nConstanta, its microfinance arm, provides opportunities to improve services to rural customers. \nTBC, Credo, and FBG offer alternative approaches to serving the target market. TBC\u2019s loans to \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) average $42,600 (August 2015). Credo, \nthrough its village lending model, provides microloans averaging $800 per loan. FBG, through \nits farm household service model, provides loans with an average of $1,038 per loan.  \n \n10.  Competition among lenders that use alternative strategies and  distribution channels \nbenefit the financing for micro and small enterprises (MSEs), as well as small farmers. Since \n2013,  ADB  has  had  a  close  relationship  and  extensive  dialogue  with  TBC,  which  has \ndemonstrated  sound  financial  performance,  an  improving  risk  profile  and  good  corporate \ngovernance. TBC has proven its commitment to reach out to small businesses through lending \nand knowledge services supported under ADB\u2019s TA. ADB also has a relationship with FINCA \nMicrofinance Holding, the owner of FBG and FINCA Azerbaijan.9 The loan to Credo builds upon \nADB\u2019s relationship with Access Microfinance Holding (AMH), which includes investments in \nAzerbaijan (footnote 11) and Tajikistan. In addition, reputable IFIs are substantial shareholders \nof the holdings, bringing their sound credit culture, responsible finance policies, and quality \nservice to low-income segments. \n \nB.  Credo Microfinance Organization \n11.  Ownership  and  business  strategy.  Established  in  1997  by  World  Vision  as  a \nmicrofinance organization, Credo was purchased in October 2014 by a consortium led by AMH \n(60.2%),  two  microfinance  investment  funds  (MIFs)  managed  by  Triodos  Investment \nManagement BV (19.8%) and three MIFs managed by responsAbility Participation AG and \nresponsAbility Investments AG (20.0%). Credo benefits from its shareholders\u2019 high integrity and \nresponsible finance standards and AMH\u2019s hands-on knowledge transfer. With 67% of loans to \nagriculture, Credo has a strong rural footprint and is now seeking to provide banking services to \nSMEs.  \n \n12.  Management and board. Credo is governed by the meeting of shareholders and a two-\ntier board comprising a board of directors (BOD) and the senior management team. The BOD \noversees Credo\u2019s operations and risks. All current BOD members are bankers with extensive \ninternational  MSME  banking  and  BOD  experience.  Credo  has  an  experienced  team  of \nmanagers, most of who moved up from loan officers to their current positions.  \n \n13.  Capital adequacy. The capital to total assets ratio exceeds 20%.  \n \n14.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. Credo serves 178,000 clients, 45% of whom are \nwomen. The loan book is highly granular, well diversified and well distributed across Georgia\u2019s \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Senior Loan to TBC \nBank Georgia for Promoting Financial Sector Growth and Service Diversity. Manila. The loan was redenominated \nin GEL100 million and fully disbursed on 19 February 2015, funded by an ADB 3-year lari bond. \n9  ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Senior Loans \nAccessBank Azerbaijan and FINCA Azerbaijan Improving Financial Service Outreach for Agriculture in Azerbaijan. \nManila. ADB provided a loan to FINCA Azerbaijan in April 2015. \n ", "4 \n \nregions. With an average loan tenor of 20 months (2014), the portfolio has a quickly liquidating \nlow-risk cash cycle. Credo has excellent asset quality with a portfolio at risk ratio (portfolio at \nrisk  for  more  than  30  days)  of  0.5%  (2014),  including  restructured  assets.  Credo  has  a \nconservative provisioning policy with loan loss reserves exceeding nonperforming loans (NPLs). \n \n15.  Earnings and profitability. During 2011\u20132014, the CAGR for Credo\u2019s net income was \n53%. Return on equity exceeded 40% in that period, primarily the result of fast business growth \nand good interest margins. Net interest margins remain strong. Credo follows a conservative \ndividend policy to generate capital through retained earnings. \n \n16.  Funding and liquidity. With its development-focused business model, Credo is strong \nin mobilizing funding from IFIs, MIFs, and commercially oriented and philanthropic investors.  \n \nC.  FINCA Bank Georgia \n17.  Ownership and strategy. Founded in 1998, FBG obtained its banking license in August \n2013.  FINCA  Microfinance  Co\u00f6peratief  U.A.,  a  Netherlands-based  cooperative  owns  FBG. \nFINCA Microfinance Holding, a Delaware-registered company fully owns the cooperative. FBG\u2019s \nhigh standard of governance was shaped by its parent transferring knowledge and providing \noversight. With 38% of its loans in agriculture, FBG has a strong rural footprint.  \n \n18.  Management and board. FBG has a two-tier board, comprising a BOD and a board of \nmanagement (BOM). FINCA Microfinance Holdings nominates FBG\u2019s five-member BOD all of \nwhich are bankers with extensive international microfinance and BOD backgrounds. The BOM \nis led by an experienced chief executive officer chosen from the FINCA network. The BOM also \nincludes the chief financial officer, the chief operations officer and the chief commercial officer, \nall experienced bankers in Georgia. Most senior managers moved up from loan officers to their \npositions. \n \n19.  Capital adequacy. FBG\u2019s capital adequacy ratio of 21% (2014) exceeds the prudential \nrequirement of 12%. FBG mainly builds its capital through retained earnings.  \n \n20.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. With an average loan size of GEL2,483 ($1,038) and \nan average tenor of 2 years, FBG\u2019s loan book is highly granular, well-diversified, and quickly \nliquidating.  In  addition  to  agriculture,  FBG  lends  to  the  trade  (29%),  services  (24%)  and \nproduction sectors (12%). With 84% of its loans outside Tbilisi, it has a strong regional footprint. \nFBG\u2019s asset quality is sound with a portfolio at risk ratio (more than 30 days) of 2.2% (2014). Its \nloan loss provisions are prudent exceeding NPLs (2014). \n \n21.  Earnings and profitability. FBG\u2019s net income reached GEL5.0 million ($2.8 million) in \n2014. FBG plans to increase its profitability through greater selectivity of quality microenterprise \ncustomers and the introduction of lending to small business customers with higher margins. \n \n22.  Funding  and  liquidity.  FBG  sources  its  funding  primarily  through  IFIs  and  MIFs. \nAlthough not internationally rated, FBG has established a good track record of borrowing from \nIFIs and MIFs because of its development orientation, sound lending process, and asset quality.  \n \nD.  TBC Bank \n23.  Ownership and strategy.  As Georgia\u2019s second-largest bank with market shares of \n27.7% for loans and 28.4% for retail deposits in 2014, TBC is a systemically important bank. ", "5 \nEstablished in 1992, TBC carried out an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock \nExchange in June 2014. The two Georgian founders own 22.42%, while IFIs hold 23%. TBC \nhas a strong franchise in the micro, SME, retail, and corporate segments. Its unique strength \nlies in its business sophistication and outreach through cost-effective electronic distribution \nchannels. With the full integration of Bank Constanta, TBC improved its rural presence and \nmaximized  synergies  using  retail  and  MSME  lending  processes  for  Constanta  clients  and \nbranches. \n \n24.  Management. TBC\u2019s board of management comprises the chief executive officer, the \nchief operating officer, the chief financial officer, the chief risk officer, and three business heads. \n \n25.  Capital adequacy. TBC\u2019s regulatory capital adequacy ratio reached 15.0% in 2014. \nTBC raised capital through retained earnings, facilitated by a conservative dividend policy and \nthe issuance of new shares and subordinated debt.  \n \n26.  Loan portfolio and asset quality. In 2014, TBC\u2019s gross loan portfolio reached GEL3.7 \nbillion, of which agriculture represents 7.2%. TBC has improved its risk profile since 2012 by \nreducing its high corporate exposure concentration and by diversifying into micro and SME loan \nsegments (14% of loans) and retail (45%). The net NPL (classified loans net of provisions) ratio \ndropped from 3.0% to 1.9% during the same period.   \n \n27.  Earnings and profitability. TBC is highly profitable. Net income increased by 28% to \nGEL157.5 million in 2014 because of robust loan growth and a stable net interest margin of \n8.5%, while its ROA improved to 3.3% (from 3.1% in 2013). Return on equity decreased to \n18.4%, from 18.7% in 2013, because of the IPO-funded capital increase. \n \n28.  Funding and liquidity. As the retail deposit market leader, TBC sourced 75% of its \nfunding (2014) through deposits. It supplements the remainder through IFI term loans and \ndomestic borrowings. TBC\u2019s funding is highly dollarized. The Basel III net stable funding ratio, \nwhich measures the stability of funding of maturities above 1 year, was 115% at the end of 2014, \ncomfortably above NBG\u2019s prudential requirement of 100%. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n29.  The  ADB transactions will  support financial  inclusion  for  MSMEs  and farmers. The \nproposed ADB assistance comprises (i) a senior loan for Credo of up to $23 million (or its lari \nequivalent) with a 4-year tenor; (ii) a subordinated loan for TBC of up to $50 million (or its euro \nor lari equivalent) with a 10-year bullet maturity; (iii) a senior loan for TBC of up to $50 million (or \nits euro or lari equivalent) with a tenor of up to 6.5 years; (iv) a senior loan for FBG of up to $7 \nmillion (or its lari equivalent) with a 4-year tenor; and (v) a TA grant of up to $1.05 million to \nsupport  (a)  TBC\u2019s  MSME  Academy  services;  and  (b)  each  of  the  three  banks\u2019  efficiency \nimprovements and the development of loan and assistance to skills improvement to MSMEs \nand farmers, including branchless banking and associated financial literacy programs to their \ncustomers. \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  Credo,  FBG,  and  TBC  will  provide  annual  audited  financial  statements,  quarterly \nfinancial statements, and compliance certificates for  loan covenants. Reporting  will include \n ", "6 \n \nupdates on (i) financial, solvency, and profitability metrics; (ii) governance, safeguards, and \nsocial protection compliance; and (iii) business performance and utilization of the ADB loans. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n31.  Economic diversification and widening access to finance. The loans will support \ndiversification into rural areas and secondary towns and will improve access to working and \nfixed investment capital for MSMEs and farms. The long tenor of the ADB loans will allow the \nborrowers to increase investment loans with longer tenors and enable funding several loan \ncycles to the target group, thereby enhancing the impact of the transactions. The concurrent \nsupport of three lenders will foster competition to the benefit of the target group, improving \nincomes and reducing poverty in the regions. \n \n32.  Boosting local currency use and leveraging lending to micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises. The senior loans to the three lenders will enhance term lending to MSMEs \nand farmers. The subordinated loan to TBC will help TBC maintain its capital adequacy and \nfurther leverage lending to MSMEs by a factor of at least 5. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations \nDepartment is also working closely with ADB\u2019s Treasury Department to secure lari funding \nthrough ADB lari bonds (depending on market conditions) following the successful launch of the \nfirst ADB lari bond. ADB loans will also help lengthen the tenor for MSME loans through long-\nterm  funding  that  cannot  be  raised  through  deposits  and  domestic  borrowings.  ADB\u2019s \ncontribution also helps diversify the borrowers\u2019 funding sources and boost market confidence. \n \n33.  Leveraging micro and small enterprise finance networks. ADB\u2019s relationship with the \ninternational AMH and FINCA networks and TBC will deepen through collaboration and develop \nbusiness for financial inclusion in the South Caucasus and Central Asia. \n \n34.  Technical assistance. The TA will help (i) TBC expand its advisory services to MSMEs; \n(ii) Credo, FBG, and TBC improve their respective MSME finance product offerings; and (iii) \nCredo, FBG, and TBC increase their respective outreach to, and financial literacy in, remote \nvillages to address possible over-indebtedness of households. \n \nD.  Technical Assistance \n35.  The capacity development technical assistance is estimated to cost $6.10 million, of \nwhich $1.05 million will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-V). Credo, FBG, and TBC will each provide matching funding of their respective \ncomponents. To ensure adequate management, accountability, ownership of the beneficiary \ninstitutions over the execution of the services, and a timely response to local needs identified \nduring implementation, the administration (selection and execution) will be delegated to Credo, \nTBC, and FBG to be carried out in accordance with ADB policies and established commercial \npractices acceptable to ADB. The role of ADB will be to monitor the compliance of consultant \nselection,  procurement,  and  the  use  of  funds  with  ADB  policies,  and  to  track  outputs  for \ndevelopment effectiveness.  \n \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n36.  The development impact will be improved competitiveness and increased availability of \ncredit  to  farmers  and  MSMEs.  The  outcome  will  be  sustainable  improvement  in  financial ", "7 \nservicing of MSMEs and farmers in the regions. The institutions are expected to set examples \nfor other financial institutions on how to deepen their outreach, while retaining good asset \nquality and funding private enterprise activities that generate jobs. The outputs will be the \nexpanded capacity of Credo, FBG, and TBC to provide financing to MSMEs and farmers in \nGeorgia by offering a wider product range customized to their needs.  \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n37.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. Under the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020, ADB aims to strengthen its support for the finance sector by  assisting the \ndevelopment  of  financial  infrastructure,  institutions,  and  products  and  services;  and  by \npromoting  inclusive  growth.10 The  borrowers\u2019  emphasis  on  funding  segments  where  the \npotential for employment and income generation is high will support inclusive growth. The ADB \nloans will help the borrowers provide loans to MSMEs in order to realize their investment needs. \nThis is consistent with the government\u2019s efforts to promote growth in rural areas and ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Georgia, 2014\u20132018.11 \n \n38.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  ADB  plays  a \ntangible role in supporting the deepening of financial services in Georgia. Since 2007, ADB has \nprovided nonsovereign loans of $125 million to banks, comprising two loans to Bank of Georgia \nand one loan to TBC, as well as TA to NBG and TBC. Bank of Georgia and TBC also benefit \nfrom ADB\u2019s Trade Finance Program, with an exposure limit of $30 million. The loans to TBC will \nbuild on the ongoing loan; the loans to FBG and Credo will be the first. ADB nonsovereign \nefforts align with efforts to develop the local currency bond market, as well as sovereign support \nfor capital markets, including contractual savings under a program approved in 2014.12 Staff of \nthe ADB Central and West Asia Department participated in processing the transactions. \n \n39.  Lessons  from  previous  operations.  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  loan  and  TA  to  TBC  helped \nstreamline TBC\u2019s lending process for small business borrowers and improve the awareness and \nbusiness skills of SME business owners through targeted advisory sessions. Since mid-2013, \nmore than 3,000 entrepreneurs have benefited from the TA. A second phase will widen the \nscope  to  targeted  one-on-one  business  advisory  sessions  to  SMEs  and  basic  training  for \nmicroenterprises. The provision of capital for investment and knowledge services through banks \nprovides opportunities for SMEs to overcome obstacles of growth through a graduation process \nwhereby entrepreneurs learn to identify and realize market opportunities. \n \nV.

The borrowers \nwill (i) apply ADB's prohibited investment activities list, (ii) ensure that investments using ADB \nfunds abide by applicable national laws and regulations, and (iv) comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009).

All  transactions  are \nclassified as having some gender elements. Credo, FBG, and TBC will comply with national \nlabor laws, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy,13 and will take measures to comply \nwith the internationally recognized core labor standards.
