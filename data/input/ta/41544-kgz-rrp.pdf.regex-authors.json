No significant adverse environmental impact is \nAssessment  anticipated. \n   \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary resettlement: Category C. \nAssessment  Impact of indigenous people:  Category C. \nNo involuntary resettlement or impact on indigenous people is \nexpected from subprogram 1 implementation. \n   \nRationale  The  Kyrgyz  Republic  faces  difficult  development  challenges. \nGross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  has  been  modest \n(averaging around 5% per year during 2003\u20132007) and volatile. \nWhile official figures put the unemployment  rate at about 8%, \nactual unemployment and underemployment rates are believed to \nbe considerably higher. Approximately 35% of the population lives \nbelow the poverty line, with 7% living in extreme poverty.   \n \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s population of just over 5 million means a \nvery small domestic market and limited potential for economies of \nscale in industrial production. Its integration with the global market \nis constrained by its geographic location and inadequate physical \ninfrastructure. The country\u2019s two major natural resources are gold \nand  hydropower.  However,  known  gold  reserves  are  being \ndepleted without significant new discoveries being made, and the \npotential for exporting hydropower has not yet been fully realized.  \n \n ", "ii   \n \n  Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s long-term development prospects depend on a \nmore  diversified  economy  and  a  more  vibrant  private  sector. \nHowever,  the  private  sector  continues  to  face  a  hostile \nenvironment  characterized  by  an  inefficient  regulatory  regime, \nfinancing constraints, and infrastructure bottlenecks.  \n \nThe growth targets and development outcomes envisioned in the \nGovernment\u2019s  Country  Development  Strategy  (CDS)  are \nambitious. The CDS aims to achieve an annual growth rate of \n8.5% during 2008\u20132010. It aims to increase per capita incomes \nsubstantially  and  to  reduce  the  poverty  rate  to  30%  by  2010. \nImproving  the  investment  climate  is  a  cornerstone  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s economic growth objectives. Accordingly, reducing \nadministrative  barriers,  creating  favorable  tax  and  customs \nregimes,  and  strengthening  the  financial  sector  are  the  main \npriorities highlighted in the CDS.  The Program is therefore fully in \nline with Government strategy and development objectives. \n   \nProgram Cluster  The  proposed  program  cluster  aims  to  support  sustainable \nDescription  economic growth and employment creation. The outcome will be \nan improved business environment and investment climate that \ngenerates  domestic  and  foreign  investment.  The  Program  will \nhave three core policy areas:  (i) reducing entry and exit barriers \nand  compliance  costs;  (ii)  improving  access  to  finance;  and \n(iii)  promoting  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure \nprovision. \n   \nSubprogram 1  Grant  It is proposed that Asian Development Bank (ADB) support the \nAmount and Terms  Government\u2019s policy reform program by providing a program grant \nof $12.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. \n   \nProgram Cluster Period  The program cluster will be implemented during October 2007\u2013\nand Tranching  December 2011. The implementation period for subprogram 1 is \nOctober 2007\u2013October 2008. The program grant of $12.5 million \nwill  be  available  following  satisfaction  of  subprogram  1  policy \nactions provided the grant has become effective.  \n \nThe  tentative  implementation  period  for  subprogram  2  is \nNovember 2008\u2013June 2010, and for subprogram 3 it is July 2010\u2013\nDecember 2011. The indicative amounts for subprograms 2 and 3 \nwill be $20 million each. \n \nExecuting and  The Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (MEDT) will be \nImplementing Agencies  the Executing Agency (EA) and will have responsibility for the \nexecution  and  coordination  of  program  activities.  The  main \nImplementing Agencies (IAs) will be MEDT, Ministry of Finance, \nMinistry of Justice, National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, and the \nState Customs Committee.   \n \n ", "  iii\nGrant Assistance   The Project will provide system support for the Program through \n  procurement of consulting services to establish a one-stop shop \n  for  business  registration  and  a  pre-customs  single  window, \ntogether with related hardware and software.   \n \nInvestment Plan;  It is proposed that ADB provide a grant of $2.9 million from ADB\u2019s \nGrant Amount and Terms  Special Funds resources. The Government will provide financing \nof  $725,000,  mainly  in  the  form  of  taxes  and  duties,  office \naccommodation, and counterpart staff.  \n \nSystem Support Project Financing Plan \n($ \u2018000) \n \nSource  Total Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank Grant  2,900  80 \nGovernment      725  20 \nTotal  3,625     100          \n                                                          Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2010 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2010. \nCompletion Date   \n   \nProcurement  The project technical cell, through MEDT, will be responsible for \n  procurement  of  all  equipment  and  services  under  the  project \ncomponent. All equipment and services to be financed under the \ngrant will be procured in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nConsulting Services  A total of 11 person-months of international consulting services \nand  24  person-months  of  national  consulting  services  will  be \nfinanced by the project grant. The consultants will support the \nimplementation of the one-stop shop business registration and the \npre-customs single window for export and import clearance. The \nconsultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2007,  as \namended from time to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting \nindividual consultants.   \n \n ", "iv   \n \nProgram Cluster Benefits  By supporting the development of a dynamic private sector, the \nand Beneficiaries  program  cluster  will  promote  broad-based  and  sustainable \neconomic  growth,  which  will  help  address  the  problems  of \nunemployment and poverty in Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n(i)  Administrative  barriers  in  the  form  of  inefficient \nregulation and excessive government intervention \nand red tape translate into direct costs as well as \nuncertainty,  thereby  deterring  private  investment.  \nBy  reducing  business  entry  and  exit  and \ncompliance costs, the Program will help promote \ninvestment and growth. The recourse mechanisms \nproposed  under  the  Program  will  further  reduce \nrisks and boost business confidence.  \n \n(ii)  Measures  to  strengthen  enforcement  of  financial \ncontracts  and  credit  information  sharing  among \nfinancial institutions will be fundamental to reducing \ncredit  risk  and  promoting  long-term  funds  for \ninvestment.  The  Program  will  also  support \ndevelopment  of  leasing  as  a  way  of  expanding \nfinance in capital equipment. \n \n(iii)  The  enabling  framework  for  public\u2013private \npartnerships (PPPs) will help attract private sector \ninvestment  in  infrastructure.  The  resulting \nimprovement  in  the  quality  of  infrastructure \nservices will significantly reduce the cost of doing \nbusiness.  It will also bring about additional direct \nand indirect benefits.  Infrastructure investment will \ndirectly  generate  employment  and  improve \nincomes.  Private  investment  in  infrastructure  will \ncreate fiscal space by reducing the need for public \nspending in infrastructure.  To the extent that this is \nchanneled toward social spending, PPPs can also \nindirectly help improve overall social welfare. \n \n(iv)  There are two additional channels through which \nthe Program will help improve the country\u2019s fiscal \nsituation  over  the  medium  to  long  term.  Less \ngovernment  interference  and  red  tape  will \nencourage  many  businesses  that  are  currently \noperating informally to come into the formal sector. \nThis will generate additional tax revenues.  More \ngenerally, more private sector activity will enhance \ntax  revenues,  thereby  enabling  development \nexpenditures. \n \n \n \n ", "  v\nRisks and Assumptions  The program cluster faces three main risks.  \n \nLimited Interagency Coordination.  Investment climate reforms \ncut  across  various  subsectors,  and  require  close  coordination \namong relevant government agencies. The Program involves five \nIAs and lack of coordination among them is a potential risk. The \nimplementation  arrangements  are  designed  to  ensure  effective \ncoordination  at  a  high  level  for  overall  policy  guidance,  at  a \nworking  level  for  day-to-day  implementation  matters,  and  at  a \ntechnical  level.  The  involvement  of  the  Investment  Council\u2014a \nhigh level forum chaired by the President and with the explicit \nmandate  to  coordinate  reforms\u2014will  also  facilitate  interagency \ncoordination. Moreover, ADB is currently working with two IAs in \nthe context of other ongoing projects (Banking Reform and Capital \nMarket  Development  and  Customs  Modernization  and \nInfrastructure Development). This will further facilitate interagency \ncoordination.  \n \nWeak  Implementation  Capacity  and  High  Staff  Turnover. \nAnother potential risks is weaknesses in implementation capacity \nand high staff turnover, especially in MEDT, which is a relatively \nnew  ministry.  To  mitigate  this  risk,  the  attached  TA  places  a \nstrong emphasis on capacity building and training.  MEDT\u2019s ability \nto attract and retain qualified staff is also increasing gradually as \nits profile as the lead agency for economic planning and private \nsector development has increased in recent years. In addition, a \nrecently  approved  World  Bank  TA  focuses  on  strengthening \nMEDT capacity by improving human resource management and \ndeveloping comprehensive training curricula for MEDT staff. \n \n  Unforeseen  Changes  in  Circumstances.  The  issues  to  be \naddressed under the Program are mostly structural and hence \nunlikely to change in the short term. However, the specific set of \ninstitutional solutions and mechanisms may need to be adapted to \nchanges  in  circumstances  (e.g.  new  parallel  and  related  laws \ncoming into effect and related institutional changes). This may \nrequire different solutions to the original problem. The proposed \ncluster approach will help mitigate these risks, as it allows for a \nreassessment of the way forward at each processing stage of \nsubsequent subprograms.  \n   \n ", "vi   \n \nTechnical Assistance  The objective of the TA is to support effective implementation of \nthe program cluster. Specifically, the TA will help ensure timely \nachievement of the policy actions envisioned for subprogram 2 \nthrough  technical  inputs  and  through  stakeholder  consultations \nand public awareness activities to build consensus on the reform \nagenda.   \n \nThe estimated cost of the TA is $750,000, of which ADB will \nsupport $600,000 as a grant from its TA funding program.  The TA \nwill engage 20 person-months of international consultants and 24 \nperson-months of national consultants\u2019 services. All international \nand national consultants will be engaged on an individual basis in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for \nrecruiting individual consultants. \n \n ", "   \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on: (i) a proposed \nprogram  cluster  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Investment  Climate  Improvement  Program \n(Program),  comprising  three  subprograms;  (ii)  a  proposed  grant  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nProgram; and (iii) a proposed grant to provide system support for the Program. The report also \ndescribes a proposed technical assistance (TA) grant for Implementation Support for Investment \nClimate Reform. If the Board approves the proposed program and grants, I, acting under the \nauthority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  Recent Macroeconomic Developments  \n2.  The Kyrgyz economy  grew at an annual rate of 4.7% during 1996\u20132005, and had \nreached approximately 80% of its pre-transition levels by 2005. The political turmoil following \nthe 2005 Tulip Revolution and a major gold mining accident1 in 2006 adversely affected the \neconomy, and real gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate in 2005 was \u20130.2 %. In 2006 it \nwas 3.1%.   \n \n3.  Owing largely to a strong performance in services (especially communications) and \nconstruction, the economy rebounded strongly in 2007 and grew by 8.2%. Services grew by \n12.4%, contributing two-thirds of GDP growth, and industry grew by 9.3%, driven largely by \nexpansion in construction activity. Construction and trading have been fueled by significant \nincreases in household demand, funded by remittances, mainly from the Russian Federation \nand Kazakhstan. Agriculture, which suffers from weak productivity, grew by 1.5% (Figure 1). \n \n \n \nFigure 1: Contributions to Growth (Supply) \n \n  10.0 \n \n8.0 \n \n  ge  6.0 \na 4.0 \n  nt\ne 2.0 \n  c\nr\n  Pe 0.0 \n2003  2004 2005 2006 2007 \n  -2.0 \n  -4.0 \n \n-6.0 \n \nYear \n \nAgriculture  Industry Industry \n \n-Gold -Construction \n  Industry \n  -Other  Trade and  GDP\nDomestic Services \n \n  Source: Asian Development Outlook 2008. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The accident occurred in the Kumtor gold mine, the largest single contributor to growth. \n ", "2     \n \n4.  Monetary policy was expansionary through much of 2006 and 2007, with the National \nBank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) resisting upward pressure on the Kyrgyz Som through \nlarge foreign exchange purchases. On the fiscal side, significant progress in revenue collection \nhas been made over the last few years. With higher receipts from value-added taxes (VAT) and \ncustoms duties, the overall fiscal deficit fell to 0.7% of GDP, down from 2.5% in 2006. Public \ndebt (largely external) levels have continued to decrease during the past few years as the \nauthorities refrained from external borrowing or guaranteeing external loans on nonconcessional \nterms. Debt reduction was also aided by the rescheduling that took place under the Paris Club \numbrella. Total external debt declined to 61% in 2007 from over 100% in 2003. \n \nB.  Near-Term Prospects \n5.  The  recent  deterioration  in  international  economic  conditions  has  brought  new \nmacroeconomic challenges to the Kyrgyz Republic. The economic slowdown in neighboring \nKazakhstan, in particular, will have important implications since Kazakhstan is one of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s main trading partners and sources of foreign direct investment. While the contagion \neffect from the Kazakh banking sector appears to have been limited thus far, it may grow, given \nthe  strong  presence  of  Kazakh-owned  banks  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  sharp  decline  in \nconstruction activity in Kazakhstan has reduced the flow of remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic \n(a major source of balance of payments inflows) as this sector employs thousands of Kyrgyz \nnationals. Largely as a result of these spillover effects from Kazakhstan, economic growth \n(excluding gold production) is expected to slow to 5% in 2008. \n \n6.  Moreover, the escalation in food and fuel prices since late 2007 has put pressures on \nthe  authorities  for  policy  responses  that  have  diverse  fiscal  and  monetary  implications. \nFundamentally,  the  authorities  face  tough  trade-offs  between  competing  macroeconomic \nobjectives. With bank reserves and broad money already growing and significant increases in \ncurrent public expenditures (salary increases of 30% and sizable increases in pension benefits) \nin the recent past, it will be a challenge to keep inflation under control and at the same time \nprovide  safety  nets  to  the  population  most  affected  by  this  shock.  Concerns  have  been \nexpressed that the current spike in imported inflation may become entrenched. The Government \nhas accordingly signaled its intention to tighten monetary policy, and to reduce nonpriority \ncurrent expenditures to enable discretionary spending to mitigate poverty impacts from the food \nand fuel crises.  \n \n7.   To cushion the impact of the price shocks on low-income households, the Government \nrecently increased cash transfers under the unified monthly benefit scheme by Som35 (from \nSom125) per beneficiary.2 The Government has budgeted an additional Som650 million ($19 \nmillion) for a variety of in-kind support, including for the purchase of farm equipment and \nfertilizers  and  for subsidized  wheat  for low-income  households.  The  Government  has  also \nannounced a Som100 million loan to Ailbank (Agriculture Bank) for onlending to farmers at \nbelow-market interest rates.    \n \n8.  In addition, the authorities anticipate the need to step-up budget-funded imports of fuel \nduring the coming winter months significantly because of the critically low levels of water in the \nmain  hydropower  generation  reservoir.  As  a  result,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \n                                                 \n2  This scheme is based on an assessment of the level of farm and nonfarm income of each household benchmarked \nagainst a \u201cguaranteed minimum consumption level\u201d. There are currently approximately 400,000 beneficiaries of this \nscheme.  \n ", "      3\nestimates that the cost of food and fuel imports in 2008 will be $350 million higher than in 2007. \nAccordingly, IMF projects the current account deficit will deteriorate to 4.4% of GDP in 2008. \n \n9.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s near-term economic prospects have therefore become markedly \nmore uncertain since late 2007. The authorities face two immediate challenges: (i) securing \nfinancial resources and implementing effective and well-targeted safety net measures to protect \nthose worst affected by the food and fuel crises;3 and (ii) formulating appropriate fiscal and \nmonetary policies in view of the trade-offs highlighted above. Effective management of these \nchallenges  will  be  crucial  for  ensuring  macroeconomic  stability  as  well  as  for  maintaining \nmomentum for reforms to improve the investment climate. \n \n10.  Selected  economic  indicators  are  provided  in  Table  1.  Because  of  methodological \ndifferences, IMF data for some variables are different.

THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, ISSUES AND OPPORTUNITIES4 \n11.   Despite a good record of macroeconomic and structural reforms, especially during the \nearly transition period, the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s economic growth has been modest and volatile. \nWhile  official  figures  put  the  unemployment  rate  at  8%,  actual  unemployment  and \nunderemployment rates are believed to be much higher. With an annual per capita income of \nabout $700, Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. Approximately 35% \nof the population lives below the poverty line, and 7% in extreme poverty. Progress toward the \nMillennium Development Goals has been mixed, and many of the targets are unlikely to be \nachieved if the country continues on its current path.   \n \n12.  A  narrow  economic  base  and  reliance  on  a  few  sectors  are  the  root  development \nchallenges. In particular, economic growth in recent years has been driven primarily by the gold \nindustry, and is therefore highly vulnerable to external shocks. Moreover, known gold reserves \nare being depleted without significant new discoveries being made. The Kyrgyz Republic has \nsignificant hydropower resources, but the potential for hydropower exports has not yet been \nrealized because of a lack of investment and regional issues related to water usage and its \nnexus to energy. Manufacturing represents only 13% of GDP, and aside from a recently growing \ntextile and fabrics sector, this sector\u2019s employment generation record has been poor.   \n \n13.  Currently, minerals and precious and semi-precious metals account for over 50% of total \nexports, followed by textiles (11%), vegetables and prepared foodstuff (12%), machinery and \nelectrical parts (7%), and glass and ceramics (6%). Figure 2 shows the composition of exports \nfrom 2003 to 2007.     \n \n                                                 \n4  Appendix 1 contains a more detailed sector analysis. \n ", "      5\nFigure 2: Composition of Exports \n100.0\n80.0\n% \n60.0\n40.0\n20.0\n0.0\n2003  2004 2005 2006 2007\nYear\nOthers  Precious metals\nMineral products Textiles and textile articles\nSource: Asian Development Bank Outlook 2008. \n \n \n14.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s population of just over 5 million people with low purchasing power \nrepresents  a  very  small  domestic  market.  Integration  with  regional  and  global  markets  is \ntherefore essential if the country is to achieve economies of scale in production. This in turn is \ncontingent  upon  the  ability  to  diversify  the  economy  and  export  structure.  International \nintegration is both (i) an outcome of an \u201cinvestment climate\u201d that enables the creation of a \nvibrant  private  sector  with  access  to  quality  infrastructure  services  and  finance,  and  with \ncapacity to venture into new business and export markets; and (ii) a major enabler of the \ninternal diversification of the economy, which itself allows for knowledge spillovers that will \ntrigger new activities, and economies of scale to improve productivity and cost-competitiveness.   \n \n15.  Taking better advantage of the country\u2019s natural resources as well as expanding growth \npotential  in  the  nonresource  sector  will  require  significant  improvements  in  the  business \nenvironment and investment climate. Existing and potential investors face a hostile business \nenvironment characterized by an inefficient and opaque regulatory regime and excessive red \ntape and state intervention. Businesses, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises, also \ncontinue  to  face  financing  constraints  as  a  result  of  fundamental  weaknesses  in  the \nenforcement of financial contracts and credit information sharing (CIS) mechanisms, which \nincrease credit risk and the cost of borrowing. \n \n16.  Infrastructure bottlenecks further increase the cost of doing business. Transport costs \nare high because of the country\u2019s mountainous terrain and the poor quality of the transport \nnetwork. Problems in the energy sector lead to frequent interruptions in power supply, disrupting \nbusiness operations. The poor quality of infrastructure has especially hurt the manufacturing \nsector, which tends to use transport services and electricity more intensively than other sectors.  \n \n17.  In 2007, the Doing Business5 report ranked the Kyrgyz Republic 94 out of 178 countries \nfor \u201cease of doing business\u201d, down from 88 in the previous year. The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s ranking \nin 2008 has improved to 68, largely reflecting recent policy announcements and legal reforms to \nsimplify business registration and the permit system for construction. While this is a step in the \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2008. Doing Business 2008. Washington DC.

Sector Description, Issues, and Opportunities \n1.  Legal and Administrative Barriers to Business Entry, Exit, Operation                \nand Trade \n18.   Inefficiencies and uncertainty arising from the regulatory regime are major impediments \nto private sector development. Business start-up procedures are onerous, and the outcome is \nunpredictable because of lack of transparency and the discretion enjoyed by the approving \nauthorities. Businesses register by submitting documents (application form, company charter \nand founder\u2019s agreement) at the State Registration Department of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) \nor other Justice Administrations in Bishkek city, Osh city, and the seven oblast (province) \ncenters. Businesses also need to visit and register at the State Committee for Taxes and \nCollection, the Social Fund, and the National Statistical Committee. MOJ then conducts a \nsubstantive review of registration documents to assess their compliance with a number of laws \nand regulations (e.g., the Civil Code and the Law on Registration of Legal Entities). This review \nprocess is a major bottleneck, causing considerable delay, and is a significant drain on MOJ \nresources.  \n \n19.  The Civil Code and other legislation govern how companies can be liquidated. However, \nthere is no easy or quick means to liquidate or remove from the register a company which is \nsimply  inactive.  Several  thousand  of  the  40,000  registered  companies  are  believed  to  be \ndormant. This causes difficulties for the tax authorities and other regulatory bodies, as well as \nfor entrepreneurs who may themselves wish to liquidate their companies but are discouraged \nfrom doing so because of the time and complexity of the procedures. If exit from a business is \ndifficult and implies open-ended tax liabilities, establishing a formal business becomes a riskier \nproposition. \n \n20.  The proliferation of inspections and related fees and fines disrupt business operations \nand add significantly to the regulatory burden. Although the list of broad activities subject to \nlicensing has been reduced through amendments to the Law on Licensing, further legal and \nregulatory changes are needed to reduce the number of existing licenses and permits, and to \nprevent their future proliferation. \n \n21.  While  ongoing  reforms  have  helped  streamline  and  modernize  custom  procedures, \nbusinesses continue to face significant barriers arising from inconsistent regulations, and lack of \nstandardized documents and coordination among the relevant agencies (such as the ministries \nof health, agriculture, transport and other certification bodies). Exporters and importers have to \nsubmit at least 12 documents to various agencies just at the pre-customs stage. Movement of \ngoods is further hampered by high transit and transport costs, both formal and informal.   \n \n22.  There  is,  therefore,  an  urgent  need  to  reduce  administrative  barriers  and  red  tape \nthrough legal, institutional, regulatory, and administrative reforms. \n \n2.  Inefficiencies in Financial Intermediation  \n23.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  restoring  confidence  in  the  financial  sector \nfollowing the destabilizing impact of the 1998 Russian crisis. Key achievements include legal \nreforms  to  strengthen  bank  regulation  and  supervision,  improved  enforcement  of  bank \ngovernance  and  disclosure  rules,  and  stronger  procedures  for  bank  resolution.  The  Asian \n ", "8     \n \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) ongoing Banking and Capital Market Development Program6 is \nsupporting  further  strengthening  of  banking  regulations  and  risk  management  policies  and \nprocedures. The Government has also recently approved the introduction of a deposit insurance \nscheme,  which  will  help  improve  confidence  in  the  banking  system  and  support  deposit \nmobilization.  \n \n24.  However,  there  are  remaining  institutional  weaknesses  that  constrain  financial \nintermediation.  Financial  institutions\u2019  confidence  in  the  enforcement  of  contracts  is \nfundamentally constrained by (i) the uncertain and ineffective legal framework for enforcement \nof  financial  contracts;  and  (ii)  the  incomplete  institutional  framework  for  warning  credit \ninstitutions against, and for establishing priority over, competing pledges on the same collateral. \nCombined, these problems generate a vicious circle in which high credit risk leads to financial \ninstitutions demanding high premiums over benchmark interest rates, and higher rates leading \nto riskier credit loans and leases) portfolios and ultimately credit rationing.7 This reduces the \navailability of funds for entrepreneurs, especially long-term funds for capital investment. \n \n25.  Ineffective  Secured  Lending  Framework.  Although  the  Law  on  Pledges  gives \nsubstantial rights to pledge holders, extrajudicial processes to enforce repossession of security \nin financial contracts are uncertain and ineffective when the pledge giver simply refuses to \nrecognize the rights of the pledge holder. As a result, parties still turn to the courts in order to \nenforce pledges. However, courts in the Kyrgyz Republic do not always function impartially or \nefficiently. Creditors are, therefore, invariably subject to long and costly judicial processes. \n \n26.  Further legal shortcomings reduce the market value of assets offered as collateral. For \nexample, the lack of correspondence between the Law on Pledges and the Law on Licensing \nlimits the value of operating licenses offered as security (as the license is quickly revoked by the \nauthorities upon foreclosure). Also, provisions in the Law on Pledges and in the Civil Code \nrequire that all pledge contracts must contain an explicit valuation of assets, which should be \nthe basis for the starting prices in auctions for all repossessed assets. A creditor\u2019s right to \nundertake a free auction is thus limited, and this significantly impairs lending. \n \n27.  Conditions for Leasing Development.  Leasing has the potential to overcome some of \nthe weaknesses outlined above. The fundamental advantage of a lease agreement is that the \nfinancing made available by the credit institution is linked to the purchase of a specific piece of \nequipment (a movable asset), ownership of which remains with the lessor (the credit institution). \nAs enforcing ownership rights under a lease agreement is in most circumstances easier than \nenforcing creditors\u2019 rights under loan contracts, leasing has a significant potential as a way of \nexpanding financing capital investment in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n  \n28.  However, leasing activity is still negligible, mostly because of (i) uncertain norms for tax \nand accounting treatment for both lessors and lessees, and (ii) lack of awareness of rights and \nobligations of lessors and lessees under different lease agreements. Given the current low level \nof leasing activity, the enforcement mechanisms for lease contracts have hardly been tested.  \nThe current practice of including provisions in lease agreements for dispute resolution through \ncommercial arbitration is questionable, and will probably not circumvent the problems of judicial \nenforcement. This is because commercial arbitration in the Kyrgyz Republic is ineffective, and, \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Program Loan \nand Technical Assistance Grant to the Kyrgyz Republic for the Banking Sector and Capital Market Development \nProgram. Manila (Loan 2224, approved on 20 December 2005). \n7  As a result, these problems get factored in by banks in the form of very high average interest rates to clients, so \nthat the pay-back period is short enough to compensate for the higher average portfolio risk. \n ", "      9\nas with loans, lessors currently have no effective extrajudicial means of enforcing their rights. \nFinancial  contracts  require  specific  solutions  to  improve  the  enforceability  of  commercial \narbitration decisions.  \n \n29.  Finally, when it comes to the origination of loans and leases, credit institutions are \nexposed to the possibility of a movable asset financed through a lease agreement in effect \nbeing presented as collateral in a loan application to a bank, without the bank knowing about the \ncompeting right (the lease agreement). If there is more leasing, the credit risk in the banking \nsector caused by this loophole may increase as there is currently no obligation to file lease \nagreements with the Central Pledge Office. This must be addressed as a matter of priority.  \n \n30.  In addition to the issues highlighted above, which heighten credit risks, there are not \nenough reporting mechanisms and practices to enable credit institutions to unveil the specific \nrisk profiles of individual credit applicants. This leads to (i) very little pricing differentiation \namong  borrowers  or  lessees,  (ii)  high  risk  aversion  and  over-reliance  on  collateral,  and  \n(iii) segmentation of the credit market (relationship lending). In consequence, credit institutions \nbear high credit appraisal costs and end up setting loan amount thresholds for their operations, \nbelow  which  no  applications  are  considered.  These  information  problems  are  a  source  of \ninefficiency in the allocation of deposits mobilized in the Kyrgyz economy. Fundamentally, the \npotential profitability of proposed new projects will not matter, in these circumstances, in the \ncredit decision. \n \n31.  Ineffective Credit Information Sharing Mechanisms. The current Credit Information \nBureau (CIB) has been in existence for 5 years.  It is funded by membership and search fees \npaid by participating financial institutions. NBKR currently has no part in it. According to the \nDoing Business report, the CIB\u2019s coverage in 2007 was a mere 1.6% of the adult population\u2013\nsignificantly below the average of 15.4% for Central Asia, and even further below the OECD \naverage of 59.3%. The effectiveness of the current CIB is fundamentally constrained in two \nways:  (i) uncertainty about its legal framework is a source of legal risk to participating banks; \nand (ii) its self-regulatory model, at this early stage of banking development, cannot address \nissues of enforcement of the reporting rules agreed upon in the CIB membership agreements.  \n \n32.  To reduce legal risks to its members, the CIB urgently needs to be supported by a clear \nlegal framework. This will require changes to the Civil Code and to the Law on Banking. \nCurrently, the Civil Code does not include a legal mechanism to enable a borrower\u2019s information \nto  be  shared  among  banks,  or  for  specialized  legislation  to  govern  CIS  mechanisms  and \nsafeguard financial privacy. The stakeholders also have to reach a consensus on the overall \ninstitutional and legal architecture that best minimizes the legal risks of positive information \nsharing.  The  consensus  building  effort  and  the  assessment  of  different  technical  and \ninstitutional options is yet to be initiated.  \n \n33.  The  CIB  system  is  generally  not  automatically  integrated  with  the  management \ninformation systems of participating banks. Thus, the daily reporting requirements impose a \nheavy burden on a bank\u2019s operations, as information about borrowers is entered manually. The \nequivalent cost of this burden, in terms of the number of bank employees set aside for this task, \nis proportional to the market share of each bank. On the other hand, the perceived benefits of \nthe CIB to the participating bank are inversely proportional to its market share. This cost\u2013benefit \nasymmetry has an impact on the reporting compliance of each bank, and the CIB is currently \nperceived by a number of banks as incomplete and ineffective in many ways.  \n \n ", "10    \n \n3.  Low Investment in Infrastructure and Utilities \n34.  State ownership is dominant in what the authorities define as \u201cstrategic assets\u201d, which \ninclude  almost  all  infrastructure.  Inadequate  resources  for  rehabilitation,  maintenance  and \noperation have resulted in a serious deterioration in many infrastructure assets and services.  \nFor example, road transport accounts for about 95% of movement of goods and people, but \nbecause of past neglect of routine and preventive maintenance, the roads are in a distressed \nstate. This translates into high freight transport costs that in turn increase overall production and \nmarketing costs. Frequent interruptions in power supply also impose significant costs, especially \non smaller businesses. This has been exacerbated by the heavy rationing of electricity in recent \nmonths resulting from the low water levels of the main hydropower reservoirs and the reduced \noutput of the main thermal power plant. Effective infrastructure services, particularly in the \nenergy and transport sectors, are key to the expansion of the economy\u2019s productive capacity. \nWithout adequate maintenance and new investments in infrastructure, economic growth will \ncontinue to be constrained by power outages, traffic congestion, high transport costs, and other \ninfrastructure bottlenecks.  \n \n35.  As outlined in the Government\u2019s Country Development Strategy (CDS) 2007\u20132010, the \nKyrgyz  Republic  has  significant  infrastructure  and  utilities  investment  needs.  Specifically, \ninfrastructure spending needs to be boosted from the current 3\u20134% of GDP to at least 6%. This \ncannot be done from the government budget and external aid alone. \n \n36.  The Government is committed to creating a conducive environment for private sector \nparticipation  and  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)8 for  commercially  viable  infrastructure \nprojects.  However, the legal, regulatory and institutional framework for PPPs is incomplete. For \ninstance,  the  Concession  Law,  1992  only  covers  concessions  and  does  not  specify  other \ncontractual arrangements suitable for PPPs. Other important gaps include: (i) the absence of \nprocedures and criteria for concessionaire selection, (ii) the lack of a general clause for tariffs \nand tariff adjustments in concessionaire agreements, and (iii) ambiguity about the availability of \ngovernment support and financial guarantees. There is a need to strengthen both cross-sectoral \nand sector-specific laws and regulations. The fact that only one concession\u2014for a gold mine\u2014\nhas been awarded since 1992 may be at least partly attributable to these weaknesses. \n \n37.  A conducive environment for PPPs also requires an effective institutional framework to \nensure a consistent approach to private sector participation across sectors. Adequate risk \nmitigation and fair risk-sharing mechanisms between the public and private sectors are essential. \nLikewise,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  effective  mechanisms  and  build  capacity  for  project \npreparation and for transparent and competitive selection of private sector partners.  \n \n38.  Private  investors  will  participate  in  infrastructure  development  only  if  they  can  fully \nrecover their costs and earn an adequate rate of return. Current tariff levels in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic are low because of the legacy of the centrally planned economy when infrastructure \n                                                 \n8  PPPs are long-term contractual arrangements between the public sector and a private sector company for the \nprovision of an infrastructure service. PPPs frequently involve complementary investments and/or services. An \nexample is private investments in power generation that are complemented by public investments in power \ntransmission and distribution. Another example from the energy sector is the involvement of a strategic investor in \nthe construction and operation of a gas transmission project undertaken by the state gas corporation. In the \ntransport sector, the public sector can either implement a network of feeder roads to supplement a privately \nfinanced and operated toll road, or provide the land required for the toll road. In airports, the public sector can \nprovide airside facilities such as runways and aprons, while private investors focus on landside facilities such as \nterminals and their operation. PPPs for ports can consist of the public sector providing the port infrastructure and \nthe private investor being awarded a concession for port operation. \n ", "      11\nservices were provided at a low or no cost, with tariffs bearing no relationship to the actual cost \nof supply.  \n \nB.  Government Strategy \n39.  The Government\u2019s medium-term development goals and strategy are outlined in the \nCDS. The CDS was prepared through extensive stakeholder consultations, and builds on the \nstrategy laid out in the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003\u20132005. The CDS focuses on \nfour strategic pillars\u2014enhancing economic potential, combating corruption, accelerating social \ndevelopment, and promoting environmental sustainability.     \n \n40.  The growth targets and development outcomes envisioned in the CDS are ambitious.   \nThe CDS aims to achieve an annual growth rate of 8.5% during 2008\u20132010. Over the same \nperiod, it aims to increase per capita income substantially, to reduce the poverty rate to 30%, \nand to increase private investment from 17% of GDP to 35%. Improving the investment climate \nby  reducing  administrative  barriers,  creating  favorable  tax  and  customs  regimes,  and \nstrengthening the financial sector is therefore one of the main CDS priorities. A key milestone \nwas the March 2007 enactment of the Law on Inspections which aims to protect entrepreneurs \nfrom  legal  ambiguities  and  unjustifiable  inspections  and  fines.  The  Government  has  also \nembarked on an ambitious program to streamline the licensing regime, and has approved a \nregulatory impact assessment (RIA) method to assess the justification for existing licenses and \npermits and the criteria for issuing new ones. A presidential decree and government resolutions \naimed at rationalizing export and import clearance procedures through the establishment of a \nsingle electronic window have recently been issued. The Government has also adopted a new \ntax code to reduce the tax burden on enterprises, streamline tax regulations, and simplify \nprocedures. The new code will be effective in January 2009. \n \nC.  ADB Operations and Lessons Learned \n41.  Supporting economic growth and poverty reduction through private sector development \nhas been an important theme of ADB strategy and operations in Kyrgyz Republic. The country \nstrategy and program for 2004\u201320069 concluded that the public investment-led growth of 1996\u2013\n2001 financed primarily by external resources was no longer sustainable, and proposed a new \nfocus on interventions to support private investments and promote exports. During the country \nstrategy and program period, ADB supported agricultural reforms to enhance productivity and \nexportability, financial reforms to stimulate savings and investments, and investments in trade \nand transport infrastructure to improve access to regional markets for exports.  \n \n42.  The Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) 2007\u2013201010 aims to achieve full alignment \nwith the CDS and interventions that yielded tangible development outcomes. Private sector \ndevelopment was a priority of the JCSS, in particular (i) support to improve the business \nenvironment and investment climate, (ii) capacity building to formulate and implement market-\noriented policies, and (iii) an assessment of the opportunities for private sector operations. \n \n43.  Relevant lessons learned have been incorporated in the program design. A key lesson \nthat emerged during JCSS preparation is that the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s development partners in \nthe past had underestimated the weaknesses in implementation capacity, which in turn led them \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2003.

By  effectively  integrating  program \nprocessing and implementation, this approach will help reduce the \u201cimplementation gap\u201d that \nhas undermined project effectiveness in the past. \n  \n44.  ADB experience has shown that in-depth analysis to identify underlying problems is \nessential for program success. This is particularly important for cross-cutting programs where \nthe distinction between root causes and effects can be blurred. The design of this Program has \nbenefited  from  a  comprehensive  2007  private  sector  study  that  covered  the  overall  legal, \nregulatory, policy and institutional aspects, as well as sector-specific constraints.11 The program \npreparatory  technical  assistance  approved  in  March  200812 carried  out  a  more  focused \nassessment of the most binding constraints and appropriate short-, medium-, and long-term \nactions. \n45.  Another important lesson is that long-term engagement and commitment on the part of \ndevelopment partners is critical to real change and the proposed Program builds on a number of \npast and ongoing projects. For instance, the Second Phase of the Corporate Governance and \nEnterprise Reform Program13 helped develop the Law on Pledges and the legal framework for \nout-of-court commercial dispute resolution. This Program will help further these reforms by \nestablishing implementation arrangements and enforcement mechanisms. Likewise, measures \nto improve access to finance will build on the achievements of the Financial Intermediation and \nResource Mobilization Program14 and the ongoing Banking and Capital Market Development \nProgram  (footnote  6),  which  helped  to  put  in  place  the  legal,  regulatory  and  supervisory \nframework for the banking and nonbanking financial sectors. ADB is also currently providing \nassistance to modernize customs and tax administration.15 There are strong synergies between \nthese two projects and the proposed Program. \n \n46.  The 2007 special evaluation study by ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department (OED) \nprovides  valuable  information  on  private  sector  development  trends,  foreign  investment \npromotion, and private sector participation in infrastructure. One of the main conclusions of the \nstudy is that developing member countries are increasingly seeking ADB support to build the \nenabling environment for the private sector (including rule of law, access to finance, and an \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2007.

External Assistance to the Sector \n47.  The JCSS exercise during 2006 and 2007 provided a unique opportunity for close \ncoordination with other development partners at an early stage of program design.  In the area \nof investment climate, ADB has coordinated closely with the World Bank, which has recently \napproved  a  $3  million  TA  project  on  capacity  building  for  economic  management.  A  key \ncomponent of this TA is strengthening the capacity of the Ministry of Economic Development \nand  Trade  (MEDT)  to  formulate  and  implement  macroeconomic  and  structural  policies, \nparticularly those pertaining to the business environment. To this end, the TA will support:  \n(i) a reorganization of MEDT to refocus its objectives and strategy, (ii) improvements to human \nresource  management  and  development  of  training  curricula  for  MEDT  staff,  and  \n(iii) establishment of a policy development group of qualified officials and financing of salary \nsupplements  for  members  of  the  group.  By  strengthening  the  institutional  capacity  of  the \nExecuting Agency (EA) of this Program, the World Bank TA will contribute directly to both its \nimplementation and the long-term sustainability of reforms. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business \nproject has also provided specific inputs in a number of areas related to the investment climate. \nADB has coordinated closely with the Doing Business team in assessing and monitoring recent \nchanges in business conditions in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n48.  Under  its  Regional  Business  Environment  Improvement  Project,  the  United  States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) has supported the development of a number of \nkey laws, including those on inspections and regulatory impact assessment. ADB has worked \nclosely with German development cooperation through GTZ to prepare the concept for the \nexport and import single window, which was supported through a GTZ regional economic \ncooperation TA. The development coordination matrix is in Appendix 2. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM AND GRANT ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n49.  The proposed program cluster supports sustainable economic growth and employment \ncreation. The program outcome will be a better business environment and investment climate \nthat will generate domestic and foreign investments. The Program will comprise three core \npolicy areas: (i) reducing entry and exit barriers and compliance costs, (ii) improving access to \nfinance, and (iii) promoting private sector participation in infrastructure.     \n \n50.  Subprogram  1  includes  a  program  grant  supporting  policy  reforms,  and  a  grant \nsupporting the adoption of modern equipment and technology for effective implementation of the \npolicy reforms. A TA grant is proposed to support implementation of reforms.  \n \n51.  Table 3 provides a snapshot of key achievements envisioned under the program cluster. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 3. The development policy letter and policy \nmatrix are in Appendix 4.

Program Grant \n52.  The program grant will comprise the following three core policy areas. \n \n1.  Core Policy Area 1:  Reducing Entry and Exit Barriers and Compliance \nCosts \n53.  This core policy area aims to reduce the cost of doing business by cutting red tape and \ndecreasing the regulatory burden on businesses.   \n ", "      15\na.  Facilitate Business Registration and Deregistration \n54.  As outlined above, the cost, time and uncertainty related to the business registration \nprocess represent important barriers to business entry. Under subprogram 1, the Government \nhas introduced the new Law on Registration of Legal Entities and amendments to the Civil Code \nto provide the legal basis for the establishment of the one-stop shop enabling businesses to \ncomplete  all  registration  formalities  at  MOJ.  The  legal  amendments  also:  (i)  remove  the \nrequirement for substantive review of registration documents and introduce standard company \ncharters for limited liability companies, (ii) remove the requirement of the lengthy process of \nlegalization on constitutive documents for foreign investors, (iii) establish rules for deregistration \nof dormant companies and voluntary deregistration, and (iv) strengthen the protection given to \nlegal names of legal persons. Under subprogram 1, the Government has adopted a detailed \nblueprint with streamlined procedures, institutional arrangements and a plan for automation of \nthe  one-stop  shop.  The  Government  has  also  commenced  the  process  of  removing  the \nrequirement  for  legalization  of  constitutive  documents  for  foreign  investors  by  acceding  to \nHague Apostille Convention.16 \n \n55.  Under subprogram 2, the Government will fully implement the one-stop shop at the State \nRegistration  Department  at  the  MOJ.  The  system  will  then  be  installed  in  the  Justice \nAdministrations of Chui oblast, Bishkek city, and Osh city. Subprogram 3 will support the rollout \nof the one-stop shop in the remaining six oblasts after incorporating lessons from the pilot stage. \nTo strengthen the accountability of state registering agencies, the Government will introduce \nregulations  and  measures  to  monitor  and  disclose  information  related  to  one-stop  shop \nregistration outcomes. The Government will begin implementing International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO) 9001 certification of the business registration process employed across \nthe Kyrgyz Republic. The ISO certification will enable the authorities to align processes with \nwell-defined objectives to maintain service quality. Subprograms 2 and 3 will also support the \nestablishment  and  implementation  of  the  mechanisms  of  compulsory  and  voluntary  de-\nregistration of dormant companies. This will involve developing appropriate \u201ctrigger events\u201d and \nnotification processes. \n     \nb.  Streamline Licensing and Inspections Regime   \n56.  The objective of this component is to improve the licensing and inspections system, \nwhich  currently  imposes  significant  costs  on  businesses  and  create  opportunities  for  rent-\nseeking. Under subprogram 1, the Government has established mechanisms for the regulatory \nreview  of  government  regulations with  clear  delegation of  enforcement  authority  to  a  new \ninterdepartmental  committee.17 The  Government  has  also  approved  an  RIA  that  sets  out \nprinciples and criteria for assessing existing licenses and justifying new licenses. Following the \nenactment of the Law on Inspections in May 2007, the Government has adopted procedures for \ninspections by authorized agencies, defining the rights, obligations and liabilities of the agencies \nand of the business entities.  \n \n57.  Subprogram 2 will support the implementation and enforcement of reforms initiated \nunder  subprogram  1  by  strengthening  the  dedicated  RIA  unit  in  MEDT,  initiating  the  RIA \nprocess in strict compliance with the rules, and ensuring public disclosure of licenses and \n                                                 \n16 The  Hague  Convention  of  5  October  1961  Abolishing  the  Requirement  of  Legalization  for  Foreign  Public \nDocuments. \n17 The interdepartmental committee is chaired by the Minister of Economic Development and Trade and includes \nsenior officials from MEDT, MOF, MOJ, Investment Council, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, National Anti-Corruption \nAgency, and the heads of the Union of Entrepreneurs and Congress of Business Associations. \n ", "16    \n \nregulations  that  comply  with  the  RIA.  The  Government  will  also  develop  implementation \nprocedures  and  strengthen  recourse  mechanisms  by  establishing  clear  mechanisms  for \nreporting violations of inspections and licensing rules to the interdepartmental committee (for \nexample, through the existing hotline in MEDT) and regularly and publicly disclosing the number \nand types of complaints and follow-up actions by MEDT and the relevant agencies. Under \nsubprogram  3,  a  full  assessment  of  the  regulatory  review  process  will  be  conducted  and \nrevisions made if necessary. \n \nc.  Reduce Administrative Barriers to Trade \n58.  The costs and delays associated with internal processes for export and import clearance \nare  significant,  and  undermine  the  potential  benefits  from  the  modernization  of  customs \nadministration and regional initiatives to facilitate the movement of goods across borders. This \ncomponent  of  core  policy  area  1  aims  to  promote  trade  by  simplifying  and  harmonizing \nregulations and documentary requirements and by facilitating information exchange among \nbusinesses and government agencies. The component will support the establishment of a \ncustomer-orientated pre-customs single window which could significantly reduce the document \npreparation  time  and  business  cost  (currently  approximately  26  days  and  $200).  Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has approved a concept paper outlining the objectives and the \nmain features of the pre-customs single window. Following this, the Government has also \nadopted a detailed blueprint for harmonizing and streamlining documentation and reengineering \nprocedures and for establishing the institutional framework for the pre-customs single window. \nSubprogram 2 will support the adoption of regulations and harmonization of customs-related \ndocuments, and to automate the pre-customs single window and the payment mechanism. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Government will also begin the ISO 9001 certification process to \nensure management and service quality. Key activities envisioned under subprogram 3 include \na full assessment of the pre-customs single window with a view to strengthening it further and \nthe consideration of advanced payment options in line with the banking facilities and systems \navailable in the Kyrgyz banking system. \n \n2.  Core Policy Area 2: Improving Access to Finance \n59.  In tandem with reforms under ADB\u2019s Banking Sector and Capital Market Development \nProgram (footnote 6) that aim to improve confidence in and the savings mobilization capacity of \nthe financial sector, reforms under the program cluster will aim to improve credit institutions\u2019 \nconfidence in the enforcement of financial contracts and their capacity to assess borrowers\u2019 \nspecific  credit  risk.  By  significantly  reducing  credit  risks  and  the  inefficiency  of  financial \nintermediation, these measures will improve access to finance to longer-term capital equipment \ninvestment. \n \na.  Strengthen the Secured Lending Framework  \n60.  Although the Law on Pledges gives clear rights to the pledge holder to take possession \nof pledged property from the pledge giver without turning to the court, in practice this right \ncannot be effectively enforced. During subprogram 1, a detailed set of amendments to the Law \non  Pledges,  the  Civil  Code,  and  other  laws  have  been  drafted  to  improve  extrajudicial \nenforcement of pledges. This will be accomplished primarily by allowing for the use of notary \nexecutive inscriptions and court executors, as well as by the removal of restrictions on auctions \nfor  repossessed  assets.  Key  amendments  to  the  Law  on  Third  Party  Courts,  and  further \namendments to the Code of Civil Procedures and the Law on Court Executors have been \ndrafted in order to improve the effectiveness of third party courts. The draft amendments will be \n ", "      17\nsubmitted to Parliament during subprogram 2. During subprogram 2, draft amendments to the \nLaw on Licensing will also be submitted to Parliament to clarify which licenses are alienable. In \nparallel, reforms to the Central Pledge Office, which supervises the regulatory, operational and \ntechnological implementation of the law, will be identified. Physical and institutional upgrades to \nthe Central Pledge Office will be undertaken during subprogram 3. \n \nb.   Improving Conditions for Leasing Development \n61.  The new tax code adopted during subprogram 1 addresses a number of impediments to \nleasing development. Until recently, lease agreements were subject to both import VAT and \ndelivery VAT (output VAT). As the import VAT charge was not deductible from the output VAT \ncharge collected, leasing was in effect subject to double taxation. The new tax code has \neliminated the VAT on leasing. Additional changes to the tax code include the removal of \nrestrictions on the interest charge that can be claimed as tax-deductible expense by a lessee. \nDuring subprogram 1, the Government has also issued a public notification to clarify that the \ncurrent legislation allows a lessee to choose between capitalizing financial lease assets or \nclaiming financial lease payments as a tax deductible expense. \n  \n62.  However, the main obstacle to leasing expansion, especially for corporate investment in \ncapital equipment (as household lessees will probably be the group that will benefit the most \nfrom the changes to VAT rules), is the weak mechanism for enforcing lessors\u2019 rights. Under \nsubprogram 2, amendments to the Law on Pledges (or Law on Leasing) will provide for the new \nmechanisms  for  extrajudicial  enforcement  of  pledges  on  loans  to  be  extended  to  lease \nagreements, and coupled with the amendments to be made on the Law on Arbitration, this will \nsubstantially improve the ability to enforce rights in an extrajudicial manner. Also under these \namendments, filing with the Central Pledge Office of lease agreements will be made mandatory \n(a lease agreement will be invalid if not registered). Implementing a public awareness program \nto raise awareness of the rights and obligations under lease agreements will be an integral part \nof the reform agenda during subprogram 2.  \n \nc.  Improving Credit Information Sharing \n63.  To develop an effective credit information system, the Government has completed under \nsubprogram 1 crucial amendments to the Civil Code to explicitly allow for negative information \nsharing and for future enactment of specialized legislation to govern CIS systems. During \nsubprogram 2, amendments to the Law on Banks and Banking Activities will be undertaken to \nensure they are consistent with the Civil Code. These activities will form the basis for progress \nunder subprogram 2, during which the Government will complete a study, in close consultation \nwith all stakeholders, to finalize legal reforms to enable the use of a borrower\u2019s \u201cpositive\u201d \ninformation, to define liabilities, and to impose penalties for its misuse. The study will also \ndevelop appropriate code of conduct for CIS institutions and procedures for borrower recourse. \nImplementation of these measures will significantly reduce legal risks to participating members \nof CIS institutions. \n \n64.  Different options to improve the effectiveness of the current CIS institution will also be \nassessed in detail during subprogram 2, with a view to achieving full compliance with CIS \nrequirements by participating banks and to minimizing duplication of investments in information \ntechnology (IT). During subprogram 2, the implementation of the most appropriate option will \nalso be initiated. Under subprogram 3, any implementation difficulties and adjustments will be \naddressed systematically by providing technical solutions to the policy framework developed \nduring subprogram 2. \n ", "18    \n \n3.  Core Policy Area 3:  Promoting Private Sector Participation in \nInfrastructure    \n65.  Core policy area 3 aims to support private sector development by reducing infrastructure \nbottlenecks such as those caused by high transport costs and frequent power outages. \n \na.  Policy, Legal, Regulatory, and Institutional Framework \n66.  The Government\u2019s support for private sector participation in infrastructure development \nwas reiterated by the President in a speech to Parliament on 10 January 2008. This high-level \npolicy statement emphasized the need for (i) an effective combination of domestic resources \nand external investments; (ii) an acceleration of the privatization of the remaining state-owned \nenterprises;  (iii) transparency, legality and economic feasibility of the privatization process, and \n(iv) the application of new PPP mechanisms.   \n \n67.  Subprogram 1 supported a review of key cross-sector and sector-specific laws such as \nthe Law on Concession, Law on Procurement, Law on Roads, and Law on Energy. Under \nsubprogram 2, the Government will develop the legal framework for private sector participation \nin specific infrastructure projects under various types of PPPs. To ensure a consistent approach \nacross  infrastructure  sectors  and  efficient  use  of  funds  by  ministries  and  municipal \nadministrations, the Government has expanded the mandate of the Coordination Council on \nMacroeconomic  and  Investment  Policy  (Coordination  Council)  to  include  formulating  and \nimplementing  PPP  policy  matters.  Specifically,  the  Coordination  Council  will  now  also  be \nresponsible for ensuring policy consistency, quality control, and transparency by establishing \nmandatory standards and principles. The Government has also established a PPP Unit in \nMEDT that will serve as the secretariat to the Coordination Council on PPP matters. For the \nday-to-day management of PPP projects, PPP focal points have been established in Ministry of \nTransport and Communications and the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Fuel Resources. Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has also established a risk management unit in the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) responsible for evaluating requests for government support for PPP projects \nand managing consequent budget risks. The PPP unit, PPP nodes and risk management unit \nwill become fully operational under subprogram 2. A risk management policy defining principles \nsuch as legality, project quality, fiscal prudence and transparency and specifying criteria for risk \nsharing will also be developed during subprogram 2.  \n \nb.  Sector Reforms \n68.  This component will support sector reforms to attract private investment in infrastructure.  \nUnder subprogram 1, the Government has completed a master plan for the energy sector. A \nsimilar  master  plan  will  be  prepared  for  the  transport  sector  under  subprogram  2.  Under \nsubprogram 1, the Government has also developed a strategy for achieving full cost recovery in \nthe energy sector through efficiency improvements and tariff increases. Subprograms 2 and 3 \nwill support the gradual implementation of the cost recovery strategy.   \n \n69.  The Government needs to shift gradually from being a service provider to playing a role \nas policy maker, planner, coordinator, facilitator, and purchaser of infrastructure services. To \nachieve this, subprogram 3 will support an assessment of the regulatory framework in the \nenergy and transport sectors, and the implementation of recommendations arising from the \nassessment. \n \n ", "      19\nc.  Pilot PPP Projects  \n70.  Under subprogram 1, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the Ministry of \nIndustry, Energy and Fuel Resources have identified a preliminary list of candidate PPP projects \nfrom their master plans. The most attractive will be piloted under subprogram 2 to demonstrate \nthe key principles, practices and benefits of the new PPP framework.  For these pilot projects, \nfeasibility  studies  will  be  prepared,  followed  by  competitive  bidding  and  contracting  under \nsubprograms 2 and 3. The sector ministries will also start a rolling pipeline of PPP projects for \nfuture preparation and execution. \n \nd.  Financing Mechanisms for PPP Projects  \n71.  There are three options for financing the preparation of PPPs: (i) allocations from the \ngovernment budget; (ii) aid from development partners on a project-by-project basis; or (iii) aid \nfrom development partners for a project development facility, which would be administered by \nthe PPP unit. During subprogram 2, the Government will assess the financing needs for PPP \nproject preparation and execution and identify funding sources. An appropriate financing facility \nwill also be established.  \n \n72.  Sustainable financing of PPP projects will be facilitated by the availability of long-term \nfunds from the domestic financial market.  As a first step, under subprogram 2, the Government \nwill prepare a policy paper on long-term infrastructure financing, outlining the measures needed \nto mobilize resources through various methods, and the structures through which such financing \ncan be provided for PPP projects. Under subprogram 3, the Government will begin gradually \nimplementing the infrastructure financing policy. \n \nC.  Special Features \n73.  Close Alignment with Government Priorities. Government commitment to improving \nthe investment climate is strong, as evidenced by the priorities outlined in the CDS and a \nnumber of recent measures, such as the approval of the RIA methodology and the Law on \nInspections. The Program enjoys support at the highest level of Government and both the \nPresidential Administration and the Prime Minister\u2019s Office are directly involved through the \nprogram steering committee. This is a unique opportunity for ADB to advance necessary but \ndifficult reforms that may otherwise not have been possible. \n \n74.  Private Sector Involvement in the Reform Process. Policy dialogue between the \nprivate sector and the Government has recently become more constructive and meaningful. An \nInvestment Council was established by the President in 2007 with the explicit mandate of \nimproving  the  private  sector\u2019s  involvement  in  reform  direction  and  policy  decisions.  It  has \nevolved into an effective forum for stakeholder consultations, and businesses have reported that \na number of their concerns have been addressed directly as a result. Program design and \nimplementation will benefit from this improved environment. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n75.  It is proposed that ADB support the Government\u2019s policy reform program through a \nprogram  grant  of  $12.5  million  from  its  Special  Funds  resources.  It  is  estimated  that \napproximately $5 million of the grant proceeds will be used to meet the balance of payments \nneeds highlighted in paras. 6\u20139.  The remainder will help leverage reforms under the Program. \n \n ", "20    \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n76.  Executing and Implementing Agencies.  MEDT will be the EA for the overall program. \nIt will have responsibility for the execution and coordination of program activities. The main \nimplementing  agencies  (IAs)  will  be  MEDT,  MOF,  MOJ,  NBRK  and  the  State  Customs \nCommittee.  The principal IAs for the Program will be: \n \n(i)  CPA 1: MEDT, MOJ, and State Customs Committee; \n  (ii)  CPA 2:  MEDT, MOJ and NBKR; and \n  (iii)  CPA 3:  MEDT and MOF. \n \n77.  Program Steering Committee. A high-level program steering committee chaired by the \nMinister of Economic Development and Trade, with representatives from the Prime Minister\u2019s \nOffice, Presidential Administration, Investment Council, MOJ and MOF will guide the reform \nagenda proposed under the Program. The committee will meet at least three times a year, to \ndiscuss issues highlighted in progress reports, and other related policy issues. ADB may join the \nmeetings as an observer.  \n \n78.  Program Working Group. A program working group chaired by MEDT and represented \nby all IAs will be responsible for day-to-day program implementation. The working group will \nmeet at least once every month to ensure progress is being made. It will submit quarterly \nprogress reports to the program steering committee and to ADB.  \n \nF.  Implementation Period \n79.  The implementation period for the program grant for subprogram 1 is October 2007\u2013\nOctober 2008. The tentative implementation period for subprogram 2 is November 2008\u2013June \n2010, and the tentative implementation period for subprogram 3 is July 2010\u2013December 2011. \n \nG.  Procurement and Disbursement \n80.  Program grant proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, other than items specified in the list of \nineligible items (Appendix 5) or imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. All \nprocurement under the program grant will be undertaken through normal commercial practices \nfor the private sector of the Government\u2019s prescribed procurement procedures acceptable to \nADB, with due consideration to economy and efficiency. The Government will certify that the \nvolume of eligible imports exceeds the amount of ADB\u2019s projected disbursement under the grant \nfor  the  given  period.  The  disbursement  of  the  program  grant  will  be  in  accordance  with \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans \n(1998). ADB reserves the right to audit the use of program grant proceeds and verify the \naccuracy of the Government\u2019s certification. \n \nH.  Tranching and Counterpart Funds \n81.  The grant proceeds will be available for withdrawal in a single tranche in the amount of \n$12.5 million for subprogram 1. All prior actions in the subprogram 1 matrix in Appendix 4 must \nhave been satisfied before the subprogram 1 can be withdrawn. \n \n82.  The Government shall ensure that the local currency funds generated by the program \ngrant  shall  be  used  (i)  to  support  the  adjustment  costs  of  reforms  to  be  initiated  and \n ", "      21\nimplemented under subprogram 1, and (ii) to finance expenditures for the Government\u2019s general \ndevelopment purposes. \n \nI.  Grant for System Support  \n83.  Objective.  The  Project  aims  to  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  by  streamlining \nbusiness registration process and export and import clearance procedures. Specifically, the \nProject will support the establishment of a one-stop shop for business registration and a pre-\ncustoms single window for export and import clearance. The Project will have the following main \ncomponents. \n \n84.  One-Stop Shop Business Registration. The Project will support the implementation of \nan automated one-stop shop that will allow all registration formalities to be completed in MOJ.  \nThis will significantly reduce the time taken to register a business (from 21 days to 3 days), and \nwill reduce the uncertainty associated with the approval process. A summary of the one-stop \nshop blueprint is in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n85.  Pre-Customs Single Window. The Project will support the implementation of a pre-\ncustoms single window to enable businesses to submit applications and receive permits and \ncertifications for exports and imports through a single channel. Currently, pre-customs clearance \nrequires at least 12 separate approvals and about 25 days clearance time.  By streamlining and \nharmonizing regulations and automatic processes, the pre-customs single window will enable \nbusinesses to obtain clearances within 5 days and through a single administrative document. A \nsummary of the pre-customs single window blueprint is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n86.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan.

Project  Technical  Cell.  A  project  technical  cell  will  be  established  in  MEDT  to \nimplement the project grant. The cell will include project managers appointed by MEDT, MOJ, \nand the State Customs Committee. It will be supported by an international one-stop shop \nregistration bureau and pre-customs single window expert and two national IT experts.   \n \n1.  Implementation Period \n89.  The project grant will be implemented during November 2008 to June 2010.   \n \n90.  The  overall  implementation  arrangements  for  the  program  and  project  grants  are \nsummarized in Appendix 7. \n \n2.  Consulting Services \n91.  A total of 11 person-months of international consulting services and 24 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be financed by the project grant. The outline terms of reference \nand detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 6. The consultants will be recruited on an individual \nbasis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from \ntime to time), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants.   \n \n3.  Procurement  \n92.  The project technical cell, through MEDT, will be responsible for procurement of all \nequipment  and  services  under  the  project  component.  All  equipment  and  services  to  be \nfinanced under the grant will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Procurement  of  goods,  equipment,  materials  and \nservices costing between $0.10 million and $0.50 million will be procured through national \ncompetitive bidding in accordance with the  Borrower\u2019s procurement procedures, subject to \nmodifications and clarifications to such procedures. Procurement valued below $0.10 million will \nbe  procured  through  the  shopping  method.  Limited  international  bidding  will  be  used  for \nprocurement of items that may not be available in Kyrgyz Republic and whose amounts are not \nlarge enough to attract foreign suppliers through international competitive bidding or if there are \nonly a limited number of suppliers. The project procurement plan is in Appendix 6. \n \n4.  Disbursement \n93.  The  project  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  expedite  project \nimplementation through timely release of grant proceeds, the MEDT will establish a separate \nimprest account for the grant promptly after their effectiveness. Total advances will not exceed \n ", "      23\nADB\u2019s estimated share of eligible expenditures to be financed through the imprest account for \nthe next 6 months, or 10% of the grant amount, whichever is lower. The imprest account will be \nestablished at a bank acceptable to ADB, and will be managed and liquidated in accordance \nwith detailed arrangements agreed on by the project technical cell and ADB. \n \n94.  The statement of expenditure procedure may be used for liquidation and replenishment \nof the imprest account or reimbursement of eligible expenditures not exceeding $5,000 per \nindividual payment. The payments in excess of the statement of expenditure ceiling will be \nliquidated, or replenished or reimbursed based on full supporting documentation. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n95.  The  project  technical  cell  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  the  Project,  including \nseparate accounts for the grant.  It will register all receipts and payments for the Project in these \naccounts. The project technical cell will ensure that the Project is managed according to sound \naccounting  principles  and  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  accounts  and  financial \nstatements for each fiscal year, including the imprest accounts, will be audited annually by \nindependent external auditors acceptable to ADB.  Audit reports should include a separate audit \nopinion on the proper use of the imprest account. MEDT will provide ADB will an audit report, \nwith audited accounts and financial statements, within 6 months after the end of each fiscal year. \nThe financial statements and auditor\u2019s report will be in English. A summary of the financial \nmanagement assessment is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n96.  The  program  working  group  will  submit  quarterly  progress  reports  to  ADB  and  the \nprogram steering committee on both the program and project grants. The reports will indicate \nprogress made and problems encountered during the review period, steps taken or proposed to \nbe taken to remedy the problems, proposed programs of activities, and expected progress \nduring the following period. \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n97.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the grant agreements \nand the binding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the EA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and \nother service providers as they relate to the Program. \n \n7.  Program Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n98.  The  program  working  group  will establish  a  performance  evaluation  system  for  the \nprogram and project components. The program performance monitoring and evaluation system \nwill include a database on the status of policy measures and program indicators based on the \npolicy matrix and the design and monitoring framework. It will also include a system that tracks \nimplementation progress of the project component in line with the implementation schedule \nagreed by the Government and ADB.    \n \n ", "24    \n \n8.  Program Review \n99.  ADB will field regular review missions (three per year) for the program and project \ncomponents (reviewing them jointly whenever possible). The missions will cover evaluation of \nprogram scope, implementation arrangements, and progress with the policy reform agenda. \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT FOR                 \nINVESTMENT CLIMATE REFORM \n100.  Objective and Scope. The TA objective is to support effective implementation of the \nprogram cluster. Specifically, the TA will help ensure timely achievement of the policy actions \nenvisioned for subprogram 2, through technical inputs, stakeholder consultations, and public \nawareness activities to build consensus on the reform agenda. Developing training programs \nand related manuals to ensure reform sustainability beyond the program period will be a priority. \nIn  line  with  the  program  reform  areas,  the  TA  will  cover  (i)  regulatory  reform  to  reduce \ncompliance costs, (ii) financial sector reforms to improve access to long-term funds for capital \ninvestment, and (iii) an enabling environment for PPP to enhance infrastructure investment. \n \n101.  Implementation Arrangements. MEDT will be the EA for the TA. MOJ, NBKR, and \nMOF will be the main IAs. The Investment Council will support reform coordination across the \nEA and IAs and the program working group formed under the Program.   \n \n102.  Implementation Period. The TA will be implemented from November 2008 to June \n2010. \n \n103.  Consulting  Services.  The  TA  will  engage  20  person-months  of  international \nconsultants\u2019 services and 24 person-months of national consultants\u2019 services. The areas of \nexpertise will include regulatory impact assessment, PPP, legal reform, and credit information \nsystems. The consultants will:  (i) liaise with relevant stakeholders from the Government, the \nprivate sector and funding agencies to foster participation in the implementation of the Program;  \n(ii) conduct technical round table discussions and workshops; (iii) follow up with the program \nworking group and IAs on implementation progress and convey to ADB any issues or concerns; \n(iv)  support the program working group and IAs on overall supervision, implementation, and \nmonitoring of various activities under the Program; and (v) prepare regular progress reports.   \n \n104.  All  international  and  national consultants  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual  basis  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and ADB\u2019s procedures for recruiting individual consultants. \n \n105.  Cost Estimates and Financing. The estimated cost of the TA is $750,000, of which \nADB will support $600,000 as a grant from its TA funding program. The Government will provide \nthe balance amounting to $150,000 equivalent for counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nadministrative and logistical support. Detailed cost estimates and consultant terms of reference \nare in Appendix 8. \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits  \n106.  The Kyrgyz Republic has a narrow economic base and relies heavily on a few economic \nsectors.  By promoting the development of a dynamic private sector through an improved \n ", "      25\ninvestment climate, the Program will significantly contribute to economic diversification and \nindustrialization. This in turn will be key to sustainable economic growth, employment creation, \nand poverty reduction.  The specific benefits of the Program can be summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  Administrative  barriers  in  the  form  of  inefficient  regulation  and  excessive \ngovernment  intervention  and  red  tape  constitute  the  single  most  important \nimpediment to private sector development. These barriers translate into direct \ncosts as well as uncertainty, thereby deterring private investment. The recourse \nmechanisms proposed under Program will reduce this risk and boost business \nconfidence. By streamlining business regulation and procedures, the Program \nwill help promote investment and growth.  \n \n(ii)  Significant  progress  has  been  made  in  stabilizing  the  financial  sector  and \nstrengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework.  As a result, confidence \nin the sector has strengthened and access to finance has improved. However, \nthe financial sector does not yet play a meaningful role in financial intermediation; \ninterest rates and interest margins are high and loans are mostly short term. The \nProgram will strengthen enforcement of financial contracts and credit information \nsharing among financial institutions, which will be fundamental to reducing credit \nrisk and promoting long-term funds for investment. The Program\u2019s support for \nleasing will help to expand financing for capital equipment. \n \n(iii)  The  enabling  framework  for  PPP  will  help  attract  private  investment  in \ninfrastructure,  which  will  significantly  reduce  the  costs  of  doing  business, \nespecially those associated with high transport costs and an unreliable energy \nsupply. More private investment in infrastructure will generate employment and \nimprove incomes. It will reduce the need for public spending in infrastructure; if \nthis saving is channeled toward social spending, PPPs will also indirectly help \nimprove overall social welfare. \n(iv)  Over the medium to long term, less government interference and red tape will \nencourage the large number of businesses that are currently operating informally \nto  enter  the  formal  sector.  This  will  generate  additional  tax  revenues.  More \ngenerally, increased private sector activity will enhance tax revenues, thereby \ncreating fiscal space for development expenditures. \n \nB.  Risks \n107.  The Program faces three main risks. \n \n(i)  Limited  inter-agency  coordination.  Investment  climate  reforms  cut  across \nvarious subsectors, and require close coordination among government agencies. \nThe Program involves five IAs and there is a risk that their work may not be well \ncoordinated.  However,  implementation  arrangements  are  designed  to  ensure \neffective  coordination  at  the  highest  level  for  overall  policy  guidance,  at  the \nworking level for day-to-day implementation matters, and at the technical level. \nThe  inclusion  of  the  Investment  Council  as  one  of  the  IAs  will  improve \ncoordination given its important role in coordinating all reforms related to the \nbusiness environment and investment climate. ADB is currently working with two \nof the IAs in the context of other projects on banking reform and capital market \ndevelopment, and customs modernization and infrastructure development. This \nwill facilitate interagency coordination and a consistent approach. \n ", "26    \n \n \n(ii)  Weak  implementation  capacity  and  high  staff  turnover.  Weaknesses  in \nimplementation capacity and high staff turnover are a potential risk, especially in \nMEDT,  which is a relatively new ministry. To mitigate this, the attached TA \nemphasizes capacity building and training. MEDT is gradually attracting and \nretaining  more  qualified  staff  as  its  role  and  profile  as  the  lead  agency  for \nmacroeconomic planning and private sector development increase. In addition, a \nrecently approved World Bank TA focuses on strengthening MEDT capacity by \nimproving human resource management and developing comprehensive training \ncurricula for MEDT staff. \n \n(iii)  Unforeseen changes in circumstances. The issues to be addressed under the \nProgram are mostly structural and hence unlikely to change in the short term. \nHowever, the specific set of institutional solutions and mechanisms may need to \nbe adapted to changes in circumstances (e.g. new parallel and related laws \ncoming into effect and related institutional changes). This may require different \nsolutions  to  the  original  problem.  The  proposed  cluster  approach  will  help \nmitigate these risks, as it allows for a reassessment of the way forward at each \nprocessing stage of subsequent subprograms. \n \nC.  Impacts \n108.  Subprogram  1  of  the  Program  is  classified  as  environmental  category  C.  It  is  not \nexpected  to  generate  adverse  environmental  impacts  requiring  mitigating  measures.  No \ninvoluntary  resettlement  or  impact  on  indigenous  people  is  expected  from  subprogram  1 \nimplementation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 9.  \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \nA.  Specific Assurances \n109.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances: \n \n(i)  the policies adopted and actions taken prior to the date of the ADB Board of \nDirectors\u2019 approval of the program grant, as described in the development policy \nletter and the policy matrix will continue in effect for the duration of the Program \nand subsequently; \n(ii)  the  Government  will  provide  budgetary  provisions  to  meet  all  counterpart \nfinancing obligations in a timely manner; \n(iii)  the  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies that may have implications for the Program, \nand will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting policy \nproposal; \n(iv)  the Government will ensure that the one-stop shop business registration system \nwill be fully in line with the blueprint and any variations will be agreed with ADB; \n(v)  the Government will ensure that the pre-customs single window system will be \nfully in line with the blueprint and any variations will be agreed with ADB; \n(vi)  the  Government  will  ensure,  and  cause  its  line  ministries  and  contracting \nagencies to ensure, that the environmental and social assessments of the model \nPPP  projects  developed  under  the  Program  are  carried  out  and  appropriate \n ", "      27\nmitigation  measures,  including  monitoring,  are  prepared  and  implemented  in \naccordance with all applicable laws and regulations. \n \nB.  Conditions for Effectiveness \n110.  The effectiveness of the grant agreement for subprogram 1 is conditional upon due \nauthorization, execution and delivery of the grant agreement for system support, and vice versa.  \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n111.  Disbursement of the proceeds from the grant agreements for subprogram 1 and the \nsystem support project is conditional on the completion of the prior actions for subprogram 1. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n112.  I am satisfied that the proposed program cluster and grants would comply with the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove \n \n(i)  the  program  cluster  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  the  Investment  Climate \nImprovement Program; \n(ii)  the  grant  of  $12,500,000  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  for  subprogram  1  of  the \nInvestment Climate Improvement Program, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Program  Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board; and \n(iii)  the grant of $2,900,000 to the Kyrgyz Republic to provide system support for the \nInvestment Climate Improvement Program, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially  in  accordance  with  those  set  forth  in  the  draft  Project  Grant \nAgreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n                    Haruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n  10 October 2008 \n ", "28   Appendix 1 \n \n SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Macroeconomic Context  \n \n1.  Narrow  Resource-Based  Economy.  With  a  per  capita  income  of  about  $700  per \nannum, the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. Approximately 35% \nof its population of 5 million lives below the poverty line, with 7% living in extremely poverty.1  \nBeing small, open, and narrowly based in terms of its productive structure, the Kyrgyz economy \nhas been vulnerable to shocks. Economic growth has averaged 5% per year from 1995 to 2007 \n(Figure A1.1), but has been characterized by booms and busts, the latter being linked to single \nevents affecting the few resource-based economic sectors on which the economy is heavily \ndependent. \n \n \nFigure A1.1: Economic Structure and Growth of the Kyrgyz Republic \n20 120 50\n45\n110\n40\n15\n35\n100\n30\n10 25\n90\n20\n15\n80\n5\n10\n70 5\n0\n0\n5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 60 R199 R199 R199 R199 R199 R200 R200 R200 R200 R200 R200 R200 R200\nR R R R R R R R R R R R R Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\n-5 GDP growth (annual %) (LHS axis) 50 Agriculture, value added (% of GDP)\nServices, etc., value added (% of GDP)\nWorkers' remittances from Abroad (% of GDP) (LHS axis)\nManufacturing, value added (% of GDP)\nTrade (% of GDP) (RHS axis) Mining, manufacturing, construction, electricity, water, and gas (% of GDP)  \n         \n     GDP = gross domestic product, LHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side.    \n     Source: World Development Indicators. \n \n \n2.  With the political instability that followed the Tulip Revolution of March 2005, the ensuing \ndisruption  in  land  ownership,  use  rights,  and  public  order  affected  agriculture and  mining, \ninterrupting  economic  growth.2 When  a  resolution  was  reached  on  gold  mining  issues,  a \nrebound in production was expected in 2006. However an accident at the Kumtor gold mine in \nthat year caused a further one-third reduction in extraction, delaying the resumption of growth.  \n \n                                                 \n1  While official figures put the unemployment rate at 8%, actual unemployment and underemployment rates are \nbelieved to be considerably higher. Progress in meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been mixed, and \nmany of the targets are unlikely to be met if the country continues in its current path. \n2  Agriculture, contracted by 4.2% in 2005 as land disputes delayed harvests, and gold mining activity fell by 24% \nbecause of disputes over gold mine concessions and road blockades by villagers seeking compensation for past \naccidents caused by the Kumtor project. \n ", "  Appendix 1 29\n   \n3.  Recent Growth is Consumption-Led. Strong economic growth was resumed in 2007, \non  the  back  of  strong  trading  and  household  construction.  This  was  mainly  because  of \nincreasing remittances from abroad, particularly from the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. \nThese transfers are now a major source of balance of payments inflow and have led to a growth \nin household demand that has been a driver of the latest expansion in economic activity. \nRapidly growing bank credit for the construction and trading sectors has added momentum to \nthis process and contributed to a sharp increase in real estate prices. Significant resources are \nbeing mobilized by Kazakh-owned local banks, which own more than one-third of Kyrgyz banks\u2019 \ntotal assets. This expansion in credit demand has not been matched by increases in deposit \nmobilization. Confidence building in the banking system has been a long process (starting from \na very low level), and recent increases in deposits have also reflected increases in Government \nbalances with banks (i.e., the increases do not necessarily correspond to a general increase in \ndepositors\u2019 willingness to keep their savings with the banking system). Riding the real estate \nboom has therefore been much preferred by savers. \n \n4.  The  recent  deterioration  in  international  economic  conditions  has  brought  new \nmacroeconomic challenges to the Kyrgyz Republic. The economic slowdown in neighboring \nKazakhstan, in particular, will have important implications since Kazakhstan is one of the Kyrgyz \nRepublic\u2019s main trading partners and sources of foreign direct investment. While the contagion \neffect from the Kazakh banking sector appears to have been limited thus far, it may grow, given \nthe  strong  presence  of  Kazakh-owned  banks  in  Kyrgyz  Republic.  The  sharp  decline  in \nconstruction activity in Kazakhstan has reduced the flow of remittances to the Kyrgyz Republic \n(a major source of balance of payments inflows) as this sector employs thousands of Kyrgyz \nnationals. Largely as a result of these spillover effects from Kazakhstan, economic growth \n(excluding gold production) is expected to slow to 5% in 2008. \n \n5.  Moreover, the escalation in food and fuel prices since late 2007 has put pressures on \nthe  authorities  for  policy  responses  that  have  diverse  fiscal  and  monetary  implications. \nFundamentally,  the  authorities  face  tough  trade-offs  between  competing  macroeconomic \nobjectives. With bank reserves and broad money already growing and significant increases in \ncurrent public expenditures (salary increases of 30% and sizable increases in pension benefits) \nin the recent past, it will be a challenge to keep inflation under control and at the same time \nprovide  safety  nets  to  the  population  most  affected  by  this  shock.  Concerns  have  been \nexpressed  that  the  current  spike  in  imported  inflation  may  become  entrenched. 3  The \nGovernment has accordingly signaled its intention to tighten monetary policy, and to reduce \nnonpriority current to enable discretionary spending to mitigate poverty impacts from the food \nand fuel crises.  \n \n6.  To cushion the impact of the price shocks on low-income households, the Government \nrecently increased cash transfers under the unified monthly benefit scheme by Som35 (from \nSom125) per beneficiary.4 The Government has budgeted an additional Som650 million ($19 \nmillion) for a variety of in-kind support, including for the purchase of farm equipment and \nfertilizers  and  for subsidized  wheat  for low-income  households.  The  Government  has  also \n                                                 \n3  However, there is considerable uncertainty about how that entrenchment could be realized, as second round \neffects of wage claims across the economy would require a tighter labor market and particular collective bargaining \nsettings. These do not seem to be the case in the Kyrgyz Republic. Nonetheless, the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF) Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility review report highlights the Government\u2019s recognition of the need to \ntighten monetary policy. \n4  This scheme is based on an assessment of the level of farm and nonfarm income of each household benchmarked \nagainst a \u201cguaranteed minimum consumption level\u201d. There are currently approximately 400,000 beneficiaries of this \nscheme.  \n ", "30   Appendix 1 \n \nannounced a Som100 million loan to Ailbank (Agriculture Bank) for onlending to farmers at \nbelow-market interest rates (Table A1).    \n \nTable A1: Summary of Measures in Response to the Food Crisis \nAmounts Budgeted \nAgency  in 2008  Purpose \nMinistry of Agriculture  Som200 million   To purchase tractors and ploughing carts to rent \nto farmers \nSom20 million  To purchase fertilizers for distribution to farmers \nSom30 million  To purchase seeds for farmers \nState Strategic Reserves  Som400 million   To replenish and increase stock of grains \nSom205 million  To replenish and increase stock of fuel with \npurchases from Russia and Kazakhstan \nAilBank  Som100 million  To onlend to farmers at 7% interest rate \n    Source: Ministry of Economic Development and Trade.  \n \n7.  In addition, the authorities anticipate the need to step-up budget-funded imports of fuel \nduring the coming winter months significantly because of the critically low levels of water in the \nmain  hydropower  generation  reservoir.  As  a  result,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nestimates that the cost of food and fuel imports in 2008 will be $350 million higher than in 2007. \nAccordingly, IMF projects the current account deficit will deteriorate to 4.4% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) in 2008. \n \n8.  The Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s near-term economic prospects have therefore become markedly \nmore uncertain since late 2007. The authorities face two immediate challenges: (i) securing \nfinancial resources and implementing effective and well-targeted safety net measures to protect \nthose worst affected by the food and fuel crises;5 and (ii) formulating appropriate fiscal and \nmonetary policies in view of the need for trade-offs highlighted above. Effective management of \nthese challenges will be crucial for ensuring macroeconomic stability as well as for maintaining \nmomentum for reforms to improve the investment climate. \n \nB.  Investment Climate  \n \n9.  Development Prospects and Challenges. Known gold reserves are being depleted \nwithout significant new discoveries being made and the potential for exporting hydropower has \nnot yet been realized largely because of the lack of regional cooperation on energy, and limited \ninvestment  in  hydropower  generation  and  distribution.  More  fundamentally,  the  path  to \nsustained increases in income per capita needs to be found outside the natural resources sector. \nManufacturing activity represents only 13% of GDP (as of 2007) and aside from a textile and \nfabrics sector that has grown in recent years, the potential for employment generation is still low. \nThe Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s small and low-income  population represents a very small domestic \nmarket (despite the increase in household consumption as a result of remittances), which limits \nthe potential for economies of scale in industrial production. Integration with global production \nand trade is therefore both the most feasible way of expanding target markets (overcoming fixed \ncosts in manufacturing activity) and of absorbing surplus labor from rural areas. \n \n \n                                                 \n5  To help address the impact of high food and fuel prices, IMF doubled the final disbursement under its Poverty \nReduction and Growth Facility (to $28.8 million) in June 2008. The World Bank has also recently approved a $10 \nmillion grant from its Global Food Crisis Response facility. The funds will be used to augment the World Bank\u2019s \nongoing Agriculture Investment and Services Project (by $4 million) and Health and Social Protection Project (by \n$6 million, of which $5 million will finance the unified monthly benefit top-up mentioned in para. 7 of the main text). \n ", "  Appendix 1 31\n   \n10.  The country\u2019s inadequate physical infrastructure and mountainous geography leads to \nhigh transportation costs for industry. Lack of adequate physical infrastructure in the power \nsector causes power interruptions that stifle the competitiveness of large-scale manufacturing \nunits. Above all, potential investors and entrepreneurs continue to face a hostile environment \ncharacterized by burdensome and inefficient state intervention, an inefficient regulatory regime, \nand financing constraints. These issues are generally lumped together under the broad heading \nof \u201cinvestment climate\u201d, and, although they affect all businesses, they are most problematic for \nmanufacturing, which is the most intensive user of energy and transportation services and \nstands  to  gain  most  from  the  institutional  mechanisms  developed  by  the  state  to  reduce \ntransaction costs (e.g., improvements to commercial and financial contracts and increases in \nthe number of cross-border transactions).  \n \n11.  Almost  by  definition,  international  trade  integration  can  only  be  undertaken  and \nsustained if a country\u2019s manufacturing sector expands its exports and upgrades its production \ncapabilities. Cross-country experience has shown that international integration is both: \n \n(i)  dependent on (a) a macroeconomic policy environment that keeps real effective \nexchange rates stable and competitive (anchored in sustainable fiscal policies), \nand (b) an investment climate that enables the creation of a vibrant private sector \nwith access to competitively priced energy, transportation and communication \nservices, with the capacity to venture into new activities and export markets, and \nhas access to cost-effective financial intermediation; and  \n(ii)  a major enabler of continuous internal diversification of the economy, which leads \nto knowledge spillovers that trigger new activities, and economies of scale to \nimprove productivity and cost-competitiveness. \n \n12.  Economic policies to improve the investment climate are therefore at the core of this \npotential  virtuous  cycle  and  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Such  policies  need  to  address \nadministrative burdens and infrastructure bottlenecks that erode the return on investment in the \ntradable sector, and the lack of efficient financial intermediation (caused by high credit risk in \nfinancial contracts and low levels of deposit mobilization), which has raised the cost of capital to \nvery high levels.  \n \n13.  High Administrative Barriers and Compliance Costs. Inefficiencies and uncertainty \narising from the regulatory regime are a major impediment to private sector development. \nBusiness start-up procedures are onerous and the outcome is unpredictable because of the lack \nof transparency and the discretion enjoyed by the approving authorities. Businesses register by \nsubmitting documents (application form, company charter and founder\u2019s agreement) at the State \nRegistration Department of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) or other Justice Administrations in \nBishkek city, Osh city and the seven oblast centers. Businesses also need to visit and register \nat the State Committee for Taxes and Collection, the Social Fund, and the National Statistical \nCommittee. The MOJ then conducts a substantive review of registration documents to assess \ntheir compliance with a number of laws and regulations (e.g., the Civil Code and the Law on \nRegistration of Legal Entities). This review process is a major bottleneck, causes considerable \ndelay, and is significant drain on MOJ resources.  \n \n14.  The Civil Code and other legislation provide for cases where solvent companies can be \nliquidated, but there is no easy or quick means to liquidate or remove from the register a \ncompany that is simply inactive. This causes difficulties for regulators and supervisory bodies as \nwell as for entrepreneurs who may themselves wish to liquidate their solvent companies but are \ndiscouraged from doing so by the time and complexity of the procedures. If exit from business is \n ", "32   Appendix 1 \n \ndifficult and implies open-ended tax liabilities (as every year, businesses need to pay taxes, \nirrespective of whether they are operating or not), venturing into formal business becomes a \nriskier proposition. \n \n15.  The proliferation of inspections and related fees and fines disrupt business operations \nand add significantly to the regulatory burden. According to the World Bank\u2019s Doing Business \nreport,6 businesses can spend as many as 291 days dealing with license and permit related \nmatters. As a result, in the category \u201cdealing with licenses,\u201d the Kyrgyz Republic ranks 152 out \nof the 178 countries surveyed. In addition to increasing compliance costs, unchecked licensing \nand inspections also provide rent-seeking opportunities. The list of broad activities subject to \nlicensing has been reduced through amendments to the Law on Licensing, but further legal and \nregulatory work will be needed both to reduce the number of existing licenses and permits, and \nto prevent future proliferation. \n \n16.  Despite having a liberal trade policy regime,7 the Kyrgyz Republic\u2019s integration with the \nglobal  economy  has  been  constrained  by  nontariff  barriers.  While  reforms  have  helped \nstreamline  and  modernize  custom  procedures,  businesses  continue  to  face  inconsistent \nregulations and a lack of standardized documents and coordination among ministries and other \ncertification bodies. Exporters and importers have to submit almost a dozen documents to \nvarious agencies just at the pre-customs stage. Movement of goods is further hampered by high \ntransit and transport costs, both formal and informal.   \n \n17.  There  is,  therefore,  an  urgent  need  to  reduce  administrative  barriers  and  red  tape \nthrough legal, institutional, regulatory, and administrative reforms. \n \n18.  Limited Access to Finance. Despite the increase in confidence in the banking system \nevidenced by the recent growth in deposit mobilization, financing by credit institutions is still very \nlimited in outreach and diversification. The capacity of the Kyrgyz financial system to transform \ndeposited savings into investment financing is low. For example, domestic credit to the private \nsector in 1995 amounted to only about 12% of GDP. In 2006, this figure was still at 10%, as \nover this period of time, the banking sector went through a deep restructuring process.8  \n \n19.  Since 2006, and induced by a boom in real estate and trading activity, bank credit has \nexpanded rapidly, outpacing deposit mobilization and driving interest rate margins to record \nlevels. This indicates that the root obstacles to efficiency in financial intermediation may have \nbecome a binding constraint to sustained economic growth in the Kyrgyz economy. Liquidity \nratios in the banking sector have decreased rapidly in the last few years with the strong increase \nin loan demand, and the already very high average interest rate spreads reached 9.7% in 2007, \nup from about 3% in 1999. This is a clear indication of credit rationing. \n \n20.  Inefficient intermediation by bank and nonbank financial institutions is a reflection of \nproblems in the legal, regulatory and information infrastructure for financial contracts in the \nKyrgyz economy. Financial institutions\u2019 confidence in the enforcement of financial contracts is \nfundamentally undermined because of (i) the uncertain and ineffective legal framework for \nenforcement  of  financial  contracts  (loans  and  leases),  and  (ii)  the  incomplete  institutional \n                                                 \n6 World Bank. 2008. Doing Business 2008. Washington DC. \n7 Kyrgyz Republic became a World Trade Organization member in 1995, the first Central Asian republic to do so. \n8  The Russian crisis in 1998 severely impacted on the soundness of the Kyrgyz banking system, with the bankruptcy \nof the largest commercial bank in April 1999 ultimately leading to seven other banks being unable to meet the \nNBKR\u2019s prudential requirements. With a large percentage of the banking sector under corrective action, the sudden \nstop in domestic credit expansion also contributed to weakness in the enterprise sector. \n ", "  Appendix 1 33\n   \nframework for warning credit institutions against competing pledges over the same collateral \nand mechanisms for establishing priority. Combined, these problems generate a vicious circle in \nwhich high credit risk leads financial institutions to demand high interest rates, and higher \ninterest rates lead to riskier credit portfolios and credit rationing. This significantly reduces the \navailability of funds for entrepreneurs, especially long-term funds for capital investment. \n \n21.  Ineffective  Secured  Lending  Framework.  Although  the  Law  on  Pledges  gives \nsubstantial rights to pledge holders, extrajudicial processes to enforce repossession of security \nin financial contracts are uncertain and ineffective in cases where the pledge giver simply \nrefuses  to  recognize  the  rights  of  the  pledge  holder.  In  practice,  therefore,  it  is  generally \nnecessary to turn to the courts to enforce pledges, although business surveys indicate that the \ncourts seldom function impartially or effectively.  \n \n22.  Creditors  are,  therefore,  invariably  subjected  to  long  and  costly  judicial  processes. \nFurther legal shortcomings reduce the value of the asset that had been offered as collateral. For \nexample, the lack of correspondence between the Law on Pledges and the Law on Licensing \nlimits creditors\u2019 ability to use operating licenses as assets for what they are worth (e.g. by being \ngiven enough time to look for an interested party, as operating licenses would be quickly \nrevoked). Also, provisions in the Law on Pledges and in the Civil Code require that all pledge \ncontracts must contain valuations of assets, and provide that auctions for all repossessed \nassets must have artificial starting prices. Creditors\u2019 rights are thus not protected, and this \nsignificantly impairs lending. \n \n23.  Conditions  for  Leasing  Development. Leasing has the potential to overcome the \nweaknesses outlined above. The fundamental advantage of a lease agreement is that the \nfinancing extended by the credit institution is intrinsically linked to the purchase of a specific \npiece of equipment (a movable asset), ownership of which remains with the lessor (the credit \ninstitution). In most circumstances of contract default, it should be easier to enforce ownership \nrights under a lease agreement than to enforce creditors\u2019 rights under loan contracts. There is \nthus a strong rationale for promoting leasing as a way of expanding investment in capital \nequipment. \n \n24.  However, leasing activity is still negligible in the Kyrgyz credit market, mostly because of \n(i) uncertain norms for tax and accounting treatment of both lessors and lessees, and (ii) lack of \nawareness of rights and obligations of lessors and lessees under different lease agreements. As \na result, the currently weak credit enforcement mechanisms for lease contracts have hardly \nbeen tested. It is expected that, as the Government addresses current tax and accounting \nconstraints, and the market becomes familiar with this alternative financial product, the lease \nportfolio quality will probably deteriorate. The current practice of including provisions in lease \nagreements  for  dispute  settlement  through  commercial  arbitration  is  questionable,  and  will \nprobably  not  circumvent  the  problems  of  judicial  enforcement.  As  described  in  the  Doing \nBusiness report, commercial arbitration in the Kyrgyz Republic is highly ineffective, and as with \nthe case of loans, lessors have currently no effective extrajudicial means of enforcing their rights.  \n \n25.  Credit institutions are still exposed to the possibility of a movable asset financed through \na lease agreement in effect being presented as collateral in a loan application to a bank, without \nthe bank having the opportunity to be aware of that competing right. The potential increase in \ncredit risk in the banking sector caused by this loophole may increase with the expansion of \nleasing in the market, as there is currently no obligation to file lease agreements with the \nCentral Pledge Office. This should be addressed as a priority. \n \n ", "34   Appendix 1 \n \n26.  The lack of reporting mechanisms and practices makes it hard for credit institutions to \nunveil the specific risk profiles of individual credit applicants. This leads to (i) very little pricing \ndifferentiation  between  borrowers  and  lessees,  (ii)  high  risk  aversion  and  over-reliance  on \ncollateral, and (iii) segmentation of the credit market (e.g. relationship lending). In consequence, \ncredit institutions bear high credit appraisal costs and end up setting loan amount thresholds for \ntheir operations below which no applications are considered. These information problems are a \nsource of inefficiency in the allocation of deposits mobilized in the Kyrgyz economy. Under \nthese circumstances, the potential profitability of proposed new projects will not matter in the \ncredit decision. \n \n27.  Ineffective Credit Information Sharing Mechanisms. The current Credit Information \nBureau (CIB) has been in existence for 5 years.  It is funded by membership and search fees \npaid by participating financial institutions. According to the Doing Business 2008 report, it covers \na mere 1.6% of the adult population, significantly below the regional average of 15.4%, and \neven  further  below  the  OECD  average  of  59.3%.  The  effectiveness  of  the  current  CIB  is \nfundamentally restricted in two ways:  the uncertainty regarding its legal framework is a source \nof legal risk to participating banks; and its self-regulatory model cannot address issues of \nenforcement of the reporting rules agreed upon in the CIB membership agreement.  \n \n28.  To reduce the legal risk to its members, the CIB urgently needs a clear legal framework. \nThis will require changes to the Civil Code and to the Law on Banking. Currently, the Civil Code \ndoes not include any legal mechanism to enable a borrower\u2019s information to be shared among \nbanks, or for specialized legislation to govern credit information sharing mechanisms. Such \nspecialized legislation has recently been recommended in the Doing Business report, but in \nterms of sequencing, the Civil Code and the Law on Banking need to be amended first. The \nvarious stakeholders also have to reach a consensus on the overall institutional and legal \narchitecture that minimizes the legal risks in the positive information sharing that participating \nmembers engage in. The consensus building effort and the assessment of different technical \nand institutional options is yet to be initiated.  \n \n29.  The  CIB  system  is  generally  not  automatically  integrated  with  the  management \ninformation systems of participating banks, which means that the daily reporting requirements \nimpose a heavy burden on bank\u2019s operations, as information about borrowers is input manually. \nThe equivalent cost of this burden, in terms of the number of bank employees directly set aside \nfor this task, is proportional to the market share of each bank. On the other hand, the perceived \nbenefits of the CIB to the participating bank are inversely proportional to its market share. This \ncost\u2013benefit asymmetry does affect the reporting compliance of each bank, and the CIB is \ncurrently not perceived by a number of banks to be complete in any way.  \n \n30.  Infrastructure Bottlenecks. The Kyrgyz Republic inherited from the former Soviet Union \nmany infrastructure assets and almost full population coverage with basic infrastructure services.  \nHowever, lack of resources for rehabilitation, maintenance and operation has resulted in a \nserious deterioration of many infrastructure services. For example, road transport accounts for \nabout  95%  of  movements  of  goods  and  people,  but  neglect  of  routine  and  preventive \nmaintenance means that most roads are in a distressed condition. This translates into high \nfreight  transport  costs  that  add  considerably  to  production  and  marketing  costs.  Frequent \ninterruptions to the power supply also impose significant costs, especially to small businesses. \nThis has been exacerbated by the heavy rationing of electricity in recent months resulting from \nlow reservoir levels and reduced output from the main thermal power plant. The development of \neffective infrastructure services, particularly in the energy and transport sectors, is key to the \nexpansion  of  the  economy\u2019s  productive  capacity  and  to  the  transformation  of  industry.  If \n ", "  Appendix 1 35\n   \nmaintenance  and  new  investments  are  inadequate,  economic  growth  will  continue  to  be \nconstrained by power outages, traffic congestion, high transport costs, and other infrastructure \nbottlenecks.  \n \n31.  The infrastructure investment requirements for improving the investment climate and \nmeeting  the  ambitious  economic  growth  target  outlined  in  the  Government\u2019s  Country \nDevelopment Strategy (CDS) 2007\u20132010 are significant. Specifically, infrastructure spending \nneeds to be significantly increased from the current level of 3-4% of GDP to at least 6%. It is \nclear that the investment needs cannot be met from the Government budget and external aid \nalone, and that private sector financing, both domestic and foreign, needs to be mobilized. \n \n32.  The  Government  is  therefore  fully  committed  to  creating  an  environment  that  is \nconducive for private sector participation and for promoting public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs)9 \nfor commercially viable infrastructure projects. However, the legal, regulatory and institutional \nframework  for  PPPs  is  incomplete.  For  instance,  the  Concession  Law,  1992  only  covers \nconcessions and does not specify other sectors in which PPPs can be applied. Other important \ngaps include: (i) the absence of procedures and criteria for concessionaire selection, (ii) the lack \nof  a  general  clause  or  tariffs  and  tariff  adjustments  in  concessionaire  agreements,  and  \n(iii) ambiguity about the availability or otherwise of government support and financial guarantees.   \nThere is a need to strengthen both cross-sectoral and sector-specific laws and regulations. The \nfact that only one concession\u2013for a gold mine\u2013has been awarded since 1992 may be at least \npartly attributable to these weaknesses. \n \n33.  A conducive environment for PPP also requires an effective institutional framework to \nensure a consistent approach to private sector participation across sectors. Adequate risk \nmitigation and fair risk-sharing mechanisms between the public and private sectors are essential. \nLikewise,  there  is  a  need  to  develop  effective  mechanisms  and  build  capacity  for  project \npreparation and transparent and competitive selection of private sector partners.  \n \n34.  Private  investors  will  participate  in  infrastructure  development  only  if  they  can  fully \nrecover their costs and earn an adequate rate of return. Current low tariff levels in the Kyrgyz \nRepublic are a legacy of the centrally-planned economy when infrastructure services were \nprovided at a low or no cost, with tariffs bearing no relationship to the actual cost of supply.  \n \n                                                 \n9  PPPs are long-term contractual arrangements between the public sector and a private sector company for the \nprovision of an infrastructure service. PPPs frequently involve complementary investments and/or services. An \nexample is private investments in power generation that are complemented by public investments in power \ntransmission and distribution. Another example is the involvement of a strategic investor in the construction and \noperation of a gas transmission project undertaken by the state gas corporation. In the transport sector, the public \nsector can either implement the network of feeder roads to supplement a privately-financed and operated toll road, \nor provide the land required for the toll road. In airports, the public sector can provide the airside facilities such as \nrunways and aprons, while private investors focus on landside facilities such as terminals and their operation. \nPPPs in ports can consist of the public sector providing the port infrastructure and the private investor being \nawarded a concession for port operation. \n ", "36   Appendix 2   \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n \nReform Areas  ADB  Other Development Partners \nReducing Administrative  Investment Climate  USAID \nBarriers  Improvement Program    Business Environment \n  Improvement Project ($4 \nKey components include:  million covering Kyrgyz \n\u2022  one-stop shop for business  Republic, Kazakhstan and \nregistration, and streamlined  Tajikistan, 2006) \nprocesses for deregistration,   \n\u2022  streamlined licensing and  In the Kyrgyz Republic, the \ninspections regime, and  project has supported legal and \n\u2022  pre-customs single window for  regulatory reforms, including the \nexport/import clearance.  drafting of the Law on \n  Inspections and the Law on the \nTax Administration Reform and  Regulatory Impact Assessment, \nModernization Project ($10  streamlining licensing and \nmillion, 2007)  permits in the construction \n  sector, and capacity building of \nThe project aims to promote  business and professional \nefficient and transparent tax  associations for facilitating \nadministration procedures which  dialogue between private sector \nwill enhance tax revenue, reduce  and Government. \ncompliance costs for taxpayers,   \nand reduce the scope for rent- German development \nseeking by tax inspectors.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s medium-term development goals are outlined in the Country Development Strategy (CDS) 2007\u20132010, \nwhich builds on the National Poverty Reduction Strategy 2003\u20132005. The CDS focuses on four strategic pillars\u2014enhancing \neconomic growth potential, combating corruption, accelerating social development, and promoting environment sustainability.  \nThe CDS aims to achieve annual growth rates of 8.5% during 2008\u20132010. Likewise, it aims to increase per capita incomes \nsubstantially and to reduce the poverty rate to 30% in 2010. The investment required to meet these objectives is large. The \nCDS therefore places a strong emphasis on improving the investment climate by reducing administrative barriers, creating \nfavorable tax and customs regimes, and strengthening the financial sector. The program cluster is fully aligned with the \nGovernment\u2019s priorities. The Program is also included in the Joint Country Support Strategy (JCSS) 2007\u20132010 prepared \ntogether with the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, Swiss Cooperation, United Nations \nagencies and the World Bank Group.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nWith an annual per capita income of about $700, the Kyrgyz Republic is one of the poorest countries in Central Asia. Poverty \npeaked at about 60% in 1999 following the Russian economic crisis.  Although poverty incidence has declined since, it is still \nat a very high level of 35%.  Almost 7% of the population lives in extreme poverty.  About75% of the poor live in rural areas.  \nProgress toward meeting the Millennium Development Goals has been mixed and many of the targets may not be met if the \ncountry moves along its current path.     \n \nMitigating the poverty impact of the ongoing food crisis is one of the most pressing challenges currently facing the \nGovernment. While food producers will probably benefit from rising food prices, the real incomes of the urban poor and the \nnet food consumers in rural areas will be adversely affected.  As the poorest 20% of the population spend as much as 60% of \ntheir incomes on food, the poor will be the hardest hit by the food price hike.    \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Program will support employment generation and poverty reduction through high and sustainable economic growth.    \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending  \n \nBy supporting a broadening of the economic base and thereby reducing the country\u2019s vulnerability to external shocks, the \nProgram will support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction efforts through higher and sustainable economic growth. The \nProgram will enhance tax revenues by encouraging businesses that are currently operating informally to come into the formal \nsector and by expanding private sector activities in general, as well as by reducing the need for public spending on \ninfrastructure.  This in turn will enable more social spending and other development expenditures that directly benefit the poor. \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nThe Program does not focus on individuals or households or specific geographical areas, but aims to support macroeconomic \ngrowth and poverty reduction through increased investment.   \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 9      73   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nStakeholder consultation for the Program started during the preparation of JCSS in 2006. Program design benefited from a \ncomprehensive assessment that was conducted in 2007 to flesh out the overall legal, policy and institutional aspects as well \nas  sector-specific  constraints.  Consultations  were  subsequently  conducted  during  the  program  preparatory  technical \nassistance and during program preparation. In addition to Government counterparts, stakeholder consultations were also \nconducted with private sector participants represented by business associations such as the International Business Council \nand Chamber of Commerce. \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \nIf a C&P plan was prepared, describe key features and resources provided to implement the plan (including budget, \nconsultant input, etc.). If no, explain why. \n \nA consultation and participation plan is not required as there are no significant social safeguard issues. Nevertheless, \nstakeholder consultation will be an integral part of the Program. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues. The project has no specific gender implications. \n \n2.
