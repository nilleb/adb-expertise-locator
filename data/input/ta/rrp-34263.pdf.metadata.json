This  has  resulted  in  rapid \ndeterioration  of  the  state  road  network,  quickly  increased \nroad transport capacity bottlenecks, unreliable road transport \nservices for the state economy and the poor, who comprise \n38%  of  the  total  population  in  Madhya  Pradesh.  This,  in \ncombination with inefficient use of scarce financial resources \nfor  road  maintenance,  has  become  one  of  the  major \nconstraints to the state\u2019s social and economic development.  \n   \n  To  rectify  the  situation  and  enable  the  Madhya  Pradesh \nGovernment (MPG) to manage the state road network more \neffectively and efficiently, and ensure reliable road transport \nservices  to  support  the  state\u2019s  economic  and  social \ndevelopment, institutional reform has become crucial.  \n   \n  The reform is expected to help establish a transparent and \nconducive environment for private sector participation that will \nimprove  the  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  road  sector \nmanagement, and foster competition. This will in turn ensure \nbetter infrastructure facilities and decrease recurrent costs for \nroad maintenance over the medium- and long-terms to allow \nhigher capital and expenditure for priority social sectors and \npoverty reduction. Furthermore, the investment component \nwill  generate  employment  opportunities  and  benefit  other \nsectors, thereby contributing to poverty reduction.  \n   \n  Madhya Pradesh is a focal state for ADB\u2019s lending activities.  \nThus,  two  loans  were  approved,  one  for  public  sector \nresource management and the other for power sector reform. \nThe SDP will be ADB\u2019s first loan to the state road sector. ", "ii \nADB  has,  together  with  the  Government  of  India  (the \nGovernment), developed a holistic approach to guide ADB\u2019s \ninterventions in the state road sector. \n   \n  The medium- to long-term objectives of ADB\u2019s operations are \nto (i) improve governance and accountability of the sector \nmanagement  by  reengineering  the  current  Public  Works \nDepartment  structure  and  building  capacity,  (ii)  initiate  an \nenabling environment for better private sector participation in \ndevelopment of the sector, and (iii) establish a more effective \nasset management mechanism and sustainable funding of \nroad  maintenance.  The  SDP  focuses  on  the  institutional \nreengineering  of  PWDGoMP  and  capacity  building  for  a \nreliable institutional framework for more effective and efficient \nstate road sector management. \n \nThe Program Loan   \n   \nObjectives  The  main  objective  of  the  Program  is  to  enable  MPG  to \nestablish  a  more  effective  and  efficient  state  road  sector \nmanagement  system  and  ensure  reliable  road  transport \nservices to support Madhya Pradesh economic and social \ndevelopment, and thus reduce poverty. \n   \nComponents and Outputs  The objectives of the Program are  to be achieved through (i) \ninstituting measures for good governance in administration \nand management of the sector, (ii) improving capability and \nbuilding capacity for effective road asset management, (iii) \nbuilding capacity to improve institutional effectiveness and \nefficiency, and (iv) initiating steps to identify pilot cases for \noutsourcing and better private sector participation.  \n   \n  The  implementation  of  the  Program  requires  MPG  to \nundertake a number of policy actions, including (i) setting up \na state highway zone (SHZ) within PWDGoMP as an interim \nmeasure with necessary staffing and institutional authority to \nintegrate key responsibilities and functions to manage state \nroads, implement the SDP, and prepare for transforming the \nSHZ into the SHA; (ii) transforming  the SHZ into the SHA as \na self-contained and fully functional agency to take over state \nroad management; (iii) staffing the SHA, at headquarters and \nregional levels, with the right skills  to make it a lean and \nefficient  organization  responsible  for  road  sector  policy, \nresource  management,  development  planning  and  asset \nmanagement;  (iv)  implementing  modern  planning  and \ndecision-making tools and preparing 5 year and annual road \nsector  development  and  maintenance  plans  based  on \neconomic  and  other  clearly-defined  sector  performance \ncriteria; (v) improving internal business processes to enhance \noperational  and  financial  efficiency,  management ", "iii \naccountability,  transparency,  and  service  quality;  (vi) \nimplementing a staff rationalization program as approved by \nMPG through implementing a labor rationalization program  \nfollowing the Government\u2019s \u2013Voluntary Retirement Scheme \nfor  government  employees  and  statutory  reduction  of \nnonpermanent employees following the Industrial Dispute Act \n1947 to free  more funds for road maintenance works; (vii) \nsecuring adequate budget allocation to ensure sustainable \nfunding of road maintenance in the near term until further \neconomic  development  and  traffic  growth  support \nestablishment  of  a  road  maintenance  fund;  and  (viii) \nintroducing effective vehicle overloading controls to preserve \nroads and road safety programs to reduce road deaths and \ninjuries. \n   \nFinancing  Plan  A loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \n  will be provided under ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate- \n  based (LIBOR-based) lending facility. The loan will have a \n  term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years, an \n  interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\n  based lending facility and other terms and conditions set forth \n  in the draft Loan Agreements. \n   \n  The  Program  will  be  implemented  over  30  months.  The \nprogram loan of $30 million will be released in two tranches. \nThe first tranche of $12 million is anticipated to be released in \nDecember  2002.  The  second  tranche  of  $18  million  is \nexpected to be released by June 2005. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The  Executing  Agency  for  the  program  loan  is  the \nDepartment  of  Finance  of  the  Government  of  Madhya \nPradesh (FDGoMP). \n   \n  The proceeds of the program loan will finance the foreign \nexchange costs (excluding local taxes and duties) of eligible \nitems  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB\u2019s  member \ncountries, other than items specified in the negative list in the \nprogram loan agreement, and imports to be financed by other \nbilateral and multilateral sources. \n   \n  Counterpart funds generated by the program loan proceeds \nwill be transferred by the Government of India to MPG and be \nused by MPG under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to \nsupport the reform and meet the adjustment costs associated \nwith the Program as agreed upon by the Borrower, including \nimplementation  of  labor  rationalization,    road  safety,    and  \noverloading control programs. \n   \nThe Project Loan   \n   \nObjectives  The project will rehabilitate the dramatically deteriorated and ", "iv \ndamaged  state  road  corridors  to  provide  reliable  road \ntransport  services  and  support  social  and  economic \ndevelopment programs, and thus reduce poverty. \n \n   \nComponents and Outputs  The Project is designed to rehabilitate about 1,750 kilometers \nof state roads identified from important state road corridors, \nincluding (i) state roads linking with the north-south national \nhighway  corridor,  important  industrial  centers,  and  major \ndistrict  roads;  (ii)  state  roads  with  relatively  high  traffic \nvolumes  providing  transport  services  for  the  predominant \nagricultural production; (iii) rural connectivity roads to benefit \nthe rural poor with better access to the mainstream economy \nand  business  opportunities;  (iv)  equipment  necessary  for \nPWDGoMP  to  ensure  quality  control,  improve  operational \nefficiency, and provide emergency relief; and (v) consulting \nservices for construction supervision. \n   \nCost Estimates and  The total project cost in 2002 prices is estimated at $261.2 \nFinancing Plan  million  equivalent,  including  $180.1  million  of  foreign \nexchange cost representing 69% of the total project cost. The \nlocal currency cost, including taxes and duties, is estimated \nat  $81.1  million  equivalent  representing  31%  of  the  total \nproject  cost.  The  cost  estimate  includes  contingencies,  a \nfront-end  fee  of  1%  of  the  total  project  loan  amount,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum and interest charge \nduring construction period, and a repayment of $350,000 for \nthe  portion  of  the  project  processing  TA  fund  exceeding \n$250,000.  \n \n   \n  A loan of $150 million will be provided from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to finance 81% of the foreign exchange cost \nand 2% of the local currency cost of the Project, or 57% of \nthe  total  Project  cost.  MPG  will  finance,  from  its  own \nresources, the remaining 19% of the foreign exchange cost \nand entire local currency cost, including taxes, duties, and \nother  associated  costs,  front  end  fee,  interest  during \nconstruction, and commitment charges. \n   \nExecuting Agency and  PWDGoMP  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project. \nImplementation  Within PWDGoMP, the state highway zone (SHZ) will be the \nArrangements  Implementing Agency until the state highway authority (SHA) \n  and its regional offices are fully functional and responsible for \n  the day-to-day implementation of the Project. The Project will \n  be implemented over a period of 5 years from January 2003 \n  to December 2007. \n   \nProcurement and Consulting  ADB has approved advance procurement for phase I civil \nServices  works  (about  350  km  of  state  highways)  and  consulting \nservices for construction supervision. All procurement to be ", "v \nfinanced  under  the  project  loan  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nConsulting services to be financed under the project loan will \nbe  recruited  using  quality  and  cost-based  selection    in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other procedures satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment \nof domestic consultants. \n   \nBenefits and Beneficiaries  The  social  and  poverty  assessments  show  that  the  main \nbeneficiaries of the SDP are people living in the predominant \nagricultural,  rural,  and  economically  backward  areas.  The \nSDP is expected to benefit 10 million people in a 30 km zone \nof influence around the state roads to be improved. Of these, \nan estimated 5 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, \nor about 50% of the total direct beneficiaries. \n   \n  The main quantifiable benefits of the Project are (i) savings in \nvehicle operating costs, which will be passed on to the rural \npoor through service providers; and (ii) savings in travel time.  \nNonquantifiable  benefits  will  be  realized  through  improved \naccess  to  markets  and  social  services  for  agricultural \npopulation and rural poor, which reflects higher profit for poor \nfarmers, and lower cost and more timely access to schools, \nmedical clinics, and employment centers. \n   \n  The Project will help reduce poverty by lowering transport \ncosts for the poor farmers and lower cost and more timely \naccess to schools, medical clinics, and employment centers.  \nThe lower transport costs will also increase mobility among \nthe poor, especially poor women going to social centers, and \nallow them to become more politically active, thus increasing \ntheir empowerment.  \n   \n  The reform is expected to involve reduction of approximately \n7,800 permanent and 8,000 nonpermanent employees. To \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s social protection framework, \nMPG has adopted a social safety net program to provide job \ncounseling, information services, and training. \n   \nEnvironmental Assessment  The Project is classified as environment category B. \nand Social Measures  An initial environmental examination (IEE) was undertaken \n  and the summary IEE is a supplementary appendix. Social \nimpacts of the SDP will be mitigated through implementation \nof  a  social  safety  net  program  under  the  Program.  The \nProject will have minimal social impacts on the project area, \nwhich can be mitigated.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  TA for Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for \nMadhya Pradesh State Road Sector has been designed to \nassist MPG to implement the institutional reform. Specifically, ", "vi \nthe TA will (i) help MPG build institutional capacity to support \nrecovery  and  development  of  the  state  road  network;  (ii) \nstrengthen  PWDGoMP\u2019s  capabilities  in  transport  planning, \nproject  financing  and  investment  management,  and \nenvironmental  management  by  introducing  internationally \nrecognized  principles;  (iii)  provide  training  programs  to \ndisseminate  findings  and  recommendations  on  the  reform \nand improvement of the state road sector management; and \n(iv) assist PWDGoMP to implement the labor rationalization  \nand  social safety net programs for the employees to be \nretrenched. The TA will be financed by the Government of the \nUnited Kingdom for $1.5 million and MPG for $0.4 million \nequivalent  in  kind  and  administered  by  ADB.  About  84 \nperson-months  of  international  and  domestic  consulting \nservices will be required. \n   \nRisks and Safeguards  Risks to the sector reform relate to MPG\u2019s political will and \nimplementation  abilities  in  making  policy  changes  and \nmitigating adverse impacts because it focuses on governance \nand staff rationalization. MPG has successfully implemented \nsimilar  reforms  in  the  power  sector  and  public  resource \nmanagement with ADB assistance. MPG has developed the \ncapacity  required  for  handling  labor  issues  through \nimplementing a voluntary retirement scheme for public sector \nundertakings, although this is the first time that government \nemployees will be involved in a labor rationalization program. \nAdditionally, ADB will conduct frequent policy dialogue with \nMPG  and  strengthen  supervision  and  review  of  program \nimplementation to ensure that the reform objectives are well \nunderstood, the long-term reform agenda is kept on track, \nand policy actions are taken as stated in the policy matrix. \nThe  tranching  and  monitoring  of  compliance  with  tranche \nrelease  conditions  have  incorporated  time-bound  reform \nmeasures to ensure successful implementation of the reform. \nThe  associated  TA  will  further  strengthen  PWDGoMP\u2019s \nimplementation capacity and help it implement the reform. \n   \n  Risks for the Project are limited to ensuring quality control \ndue to PWDGoMP\u2019s limited capacity to carry out effective \ncontract management and supervision of works. However, \nthis  can  be  mitigated  by  hiring  consulting  services  for \nconstruction supervision and capacity building programs for \nPWDGoMP  on  contract  management  and  quality  control. \nContracts have been divided into relatively large packages to \nattract international and large qualified domestic contractors \nto ensure good performance by contractors and high quality \nconstruction.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) two proposed \nloans to India for the Madhya Pradesh State Roads Sector Development Program (SDP) that \ncomprises a Program Loan and a Project Loan; and (ii) proposed administration of technical \nassistance (TA) for Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building for Madhya Pradesh State \nRoad Sector. \n \n \nII.  THE SECTOR: PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n1.  Recent Macroeconomic Performance and Prospects \n2.  Madhya Pradesh was one of the poorest states in India. It was the largest state in land \narea and fourth in population until it was bifurcated into Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh on 1 \nNovember  2000  in  accordance  with  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Reorganization  Act  2000.  The \nbifurcation made Madhya Pradesh lose its rich coal, iron ore, limestone, and forest resources, \nwhich were prime sources of industrial growth in Madhya Pradesh before the bifurcation. The \nstate economy had shown robust growth averaging 4.4% since 1980, accelerating to 5% during \n1990\u20131996.  While  contribution  of  the  primary  sector  in  state  domestic  product  declined \ngradually from 43.4 % in 1993 to 39.6% in 1999, the contribution of services and industry rose \nconsistently from 21.4% to 23% % during the same period.  \n \n3.  After bifurcation, Madhya Pradesh retained about two thirds of its former land area and \npopulation, but has lost most of its natural resources to Chhattisgarh. Agriculture dominates the \neconomy, with small manufacturing and service sectors. The economy has been performing \npoorly since 1996 with a weakening revenue base, as shown by the recent budget review under \nthe Asian Development Bank(ADB)-financed Public Sector Resource Management Program1, \nand fiscal deficit increasing from 5.4% in 1999 to 8% in 2001.   \n \n4.  Structural impediments have prevented the economy from reaching its potential given \nthe  liberalized  policy  environment.  In  particular,  the  deteriorating  fiscal  health  of  the  state \ngovernment has significantly undermined the economy\u2019s long-term growth potential because of \ninadequate public investment. Industrial recession, acute power shortages and fast deterioration \nof  transport  infrastructure  facilities  led  to  a  sharp  decline  in  industrial  growth  in  Madhya \nPradesh. The growth rate of the state\u2019s real net domestic product of registered manufacturing \ndeclined from 7.1% in 1994 to 4.4% in 1996, and to 1.1% in 1997. Many industrial units were \nforced to shut down, leading to large-scale unemployment. Many designated economic growth \ncenters  in  Madhya  Pradesh  failed  to  promote  industrialization  due  to  the  lack  of  basic \ninfrastructure such as roads. A recent survey by the Public Works Department of the Goernment \nof Madhya Pradesh (PWDGoMP) has shown that Madhya Pradesh\u2019s economy is severely \nconstrained by poor road infrastructure. State roads are generally in very poor condition. The \n                                                 \n1 ADB, 1999.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Loan to India \nMadhya Pradesh Public Resource Management Program. ", "2     \nrural poor lack access to the mainstream economy and business opportunities. Road traffic in \n2001 and early 2002 on most of the state road sections fell into the very low range of 500 to \n1,500 vehicles a day. This was partly due to the dramatic deterioration of the state roads, which \nforced almost all through traffic to use alternative routes in neighboring states. \n \n5.  Along with development of new strategies for stimulating industrial growth, the plans for \nindustrialization in Madhya Pradesh focus primarily on promoting industries not tied to natural \nresources, which will mostly depend on adequate infrastructure facilities, mainly inter and intra-\nstate road transport services. \n \n2.  Transport Sector \n \n6.  Railways connecting north-south and east-west regions of India pass through Madhya \nPradesh with a total length of about 5,900 km. However, due to Madhya Pradesh's vast area, \nthe railway services cannot provide the desired connectivity to major economic zones and \ncenters. The railway network traversing Madhya Pradesh serves the needs of cross-country \ntraffic more than those of Madhya Pradesh. In total, 11 major districts in Madhya Pradesh  have \nlittle rail service. Civil aviation, port, and inland waterway have very limited role in the state\u2019s \noverall economy and transport services.  As a result, roads are the predominant mode of \ntransport services. \n \n7.  Madhya  Pradesh  has  202,240  kilometers  (km)  of  roads,  of  which  57,205  km  are \nsurfaced. State has 7,923 km of state highways, 4,717 km of national highways, 30,070 km of \ndistrict roads, and 159,530 of rural roads. Of the rural roads, 25,033 km are under PWDGoMP\u2019s \njurisdiction while the remaining 134,497 km are under the responsibility of Madhya Pradesh \nRural Road Development Authority (MPRRDA) and local village authorities (panchayats). \n \n3.  Road Sector Institutions and Responsibilities \n \n8.  The  public  works  department  (PWD)  system  dates  back  to  the  mid-1850s,  and  is \noutmoded. Since then, the system has monopolized engineering, construction supervision, and \nmaintenance services for all infrastructure facilities. Because of the monopoly, the system \ngenerates no incentive to adopt modern managerial mechanisms or to operate more efficiently. \nThe  system  does  not  provide  local  consultants  and  contractors  with  a  transparent  and \ncompetitive environment or opportunities to develop their capacity and competitiveness. This, in \ncombination with the outdated knowledge and skills and management system, has made the \nPWD system inefficient and ineffective. Its implementation capabilities are also very limited due \nto the slow turnover of staff and little opportunity for promotion and career development. \n \n9.  PWDGoMP oversees planning, design, construction, and maintenance of all state roads, \nmajor  bridges,  and  government  and  public  services  buildings.  Jointly  with  local  district \ngovernments, it is responsible for district roads, some village roads, small bridges, and other \nbuildings. It is also responsible for maintenance of national highways under the delegated \nauthority  and  responsibility  by  the  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways  (MORTH). \nResponsibility  for  construction  and  maintenance  of  most  village  roads  rests  with  Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s rural engineering services and MPRRDA. PWDGoMP\u2019s poor capability in effective \nplanning and programming, low capacity for management and quality control for construction \nand  maintenance,  serious  shortage  of  financial  resources,  and  ineffective  management  of \nfinancial resources has resulted in substantive investment deficiencies in the state\u2019s road sector, \nand gross lack of maintenance of the road network. \n ", "    3 \n10.  Licensing, registration, and regulation of motor vehicles, drivers, and passenger and \nfreight transport is with the Madhya Pradesh Transport Department (MPTD). In 2001, over 2.9 \nmillion motor vehicles were registered of which 74% were motorcycles, 5% were cars and jeeps, \n3% commercial trucks, 2% buses and minibuses, 2% two- and three-wheeler public transport \nvehicles, 9% tractors, and 5% others. The state-owned Madhya Pradesh State Road Transport \nCorporation (MPSRTC) operates only 3% of the state\u2019s buses. Private sector operators provide \nmost of the services for passenger and freight transport. MPTD is also responsible for  enforcing \naxle load regulations. It has a system of 39 weigh stations at entry points into the state, and \nmobile squads to carry out its responsibilities. Traffic police are responsible for enforcing traffic \nand road safety regulations. The traffic police are under the Police Department. \n \n4.  Sector Performance  \n \n11.  PWDGoMP performs inadequately in its responsibility and accountability for managing \nstate roads, mainly due to a lack of clear objectives, technical capability, and institutional \ncapacity in sector policy formulation, investment planning and programming, project formulation, \nproject execution, and management of road maintenance.  \n \n12.  PWDGoMP has too many personnel2 who account for more than 67% of the nonplanned \nbudget (for recurrent expenditures) or 29% of the total budget allocated to PWDGoMP for salary \npayment, thus reducing the available budget for materials and equipment essential for effective \nroad  maintenance.  The  skills  mix  is  inadequate  for  contemporary  needs.  A  hiring  freeze \nintended  to  limit  numbers  has  meant  that  engineers  with  up-to-date  skills  have  not  been \nrecruited. Training is only provided in administrative procedures, and professional staff have no \nmeans of upgrading their technical skills. Opportunities for promotion are limited. As a result, \nPWDGoMP cannot maintain standards. Professional staff are discouraged and accountability is \nnot enforced.  The result is poor governance and poor sector management. \n \n13.  Management of state roads is linked to a very general development strategy and is not \nbased  on  performance.  Procedural  delays  in  administrative  processes  have  resulted  in \ninefficient use of funds. Financial accounting and financial management systems are simple \nbookkeeping  system  performed  manually  and  recorded  in  a  loose  archive  system.  Road \nplanning is inadequate and suffers from a lack of reliable data. There is no ongoing process for \nidentifying  needs  and  planning  responses  based  on  a  development  strategy  and  applying \neconomic criteria. Data required for strategic planning such as road and bridge inventories, \ncondition, traffic, and accident locations are limited and not updated (the last official traffic \nupdate was in 1995). \n \n14.  In-house technical design capacity is limited and used only for minor works.  Road \nconstruction  methods  are  generally  outdated,  inefficient,  and  low  quality.  Construction \nsupervision by staff is mainly process-oriented without effective mechanisms to control quality, \nprogress,  and  costs.  Routine  maintenance  is  ineffective  because  there  is  insufficient \nnonplanedn budget for materials, plant, and equipment. Plant and equipment are obsolete.3 \nGang labor is unproductive. There is no system of maintenance planning and accountability for \nperformance. Periodic maintenance is carried out mainly through contracting but supervision \nand quality control are inadequate.  A detailed analysis is provided in Appendix 1. \n                                                 \n2 PWDGOMP has 18,616 comprising 18,616 permanent employees comprising 2,338 engineering staff, 10,763 \nsupport personnel, and 5,515 tradesmen. More than 20,000 nonpermanent laborers are employed nominally in \nmaintenance of roads and buildings. \n3  Road maintenance equipment and workshops are in a dilapidated condition. PWDGOMP is scrapping or auctioning \ndisused equipment and will hire equipment and transport in future. ", "4     \n \n15.  Due to a lack of management information and financial accounting systems, there are no \nreliable statistics and performance measures of previous programs and activities. Particularly, it \nis difficult for PWDGoMP to extrapolate detailed information on budget use and personnel \nmanagement to support its planning process and decisions on sector policies and reforms.  \n \n16.  Overloading  of  vehicles  is  widespread,  magnifying  poor  road  conditions  created  by \ninadequate maintenance. MPTD data show that over 90% of the trucks passing through weigh \nstations are overloaded. This is also a national problem as most of the trucks are on interstate \njourneys. MPTD needs to strengthen enforcement of vehicle weight regulations.  Road safety is \na serious problem, and death4 and injury rates are high in comparison to developed countries.  \nThe Police Department collects accident data and has a road safety education program but \nPWDGoMP does not appear to consider road safety as a part of its mandate. There is a need to \nestablish a road safety program in PWDGoMP to eliminate road safety hazards.  \n \n17.  Private sector operators provide most road transport services. Services are generally \nadequate but travel is arduous and time-consuming due to the poor road conditions. The private \nsector does not provide services to many outlying districts and services to these districts have to \nbe provided by the state-owned MPRTC. The maximum fare that can be charged are regulated \nby MPTD and is presently set at Rs0.40 /km, which is one of the highest rates in India. Better \nroads will reduce vehicle-operating costs and lead to lower fares.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n \n1.  Challenges to the Sector \n \n18.  In August 2001, MPG formulated a policy on road development for the Period 2001-2010 \n(PRD) aiming to improve the road network and maintenance and encourage private participation \nin the sector. The PRD recognized that improved road transport services is critical for the state\u2019s \neconomic and social development, and that road network built at huge costs have deteriorated \ndramatically, largely due to: (i) continued shortfalls in road maintenance investment, (ii) poor \nsector  management,  (iii)  non-performing  road  maintenance  system,  and  (iv)  an  increasing \nvolume of traffic and overloading. \n \n19.  The PRD identified creation of a state road maintenance fund (SRMF) as a priority. The \nSRMF is expected to help available resources to optimize road maintenance and leverage the \nresources through build-operate-transfer (BOT) and other modalities to attract private sector \nfunding. \n \n20.  However, this will be a long-term objective because road users can not afford to pay \nmuch, traffic volumes are moderate on most of the state roads, and technical and institutional \nsupport for identifying road user charges is lacking. Tolling on roads has been a well-accepted \npractice but it does not generate much revenue due to the low traffic volumes. Other revenue \nsources identified for the SRMF include assistance from the Central Road Fund, Mandi Cess,5 \nand additional fuel levies and taxes on vehicles, which are all earmarked for specific types of \n                                                 \n4  In 2001, 3,860 deaths and 27,564 injuries were reported. The death rate of 124 per 100,000 vehicles is 5-8 times \nhigher than that in Europe or North America. \n5  A user charge on the use of market facilities developed by local governments for improvement of market access \nroads.  ", "    5 \nprojects. In the near term of 5 years, the main source for funding road maintenance will largely \nbe the state budget. \n \n21.  MPG has recognized the significant impact of overstaffing its state departments and \nintroduced a staff reduction scheme (SRS) in February 2000.  The SRS requires all government \ndepartments to reduce their staff by 30% through natural attrition, reduction in sanctioned \npositions, and rationalization programs.  This has entailed identifying surplus staff, freezing of \nnew hiring, developing voluntary retirement schemes (VRS), and initiating a significant and \nsensitive  retrenchment  program  and  measures  to  increase  labor  productivity.  The \nimplementation of the SRS follows the Government\u2019s VRS for compensation to permanent \nemployees and the Industrial Dispute Act 1947 (IDAct) for compensation to nonpermanent \nemployees. The MPG also developed eligibility criteria and administrative procedures for the \nlabor rationalization. \n \n22.  To implement the PRD, PWDGoMP has prepared a master plan for 2001-2010, and the \n10th Five-Year Plan for 2002-2007, which covers the first 5 years of the master plan. Both plans \nhave been approved by MPG in October 2002. The master plan aims to remove physical \nconstraints on 15,000 km of state roads and major district roads by rehabilitating of priority \ncorridors  connecting  to  national  highways,  rural  and  economically  backward  areas,  and \neconomic  development  zones.  For  road  maintenance,  a  computer-based  pavement \nmanagement system is to be developed so PWDGoMP can evaluate the economic effects of \nroad maintenance alternatives and optimize road maintenance strategies. \n \n  2.  Development Program \n \n23.  Under the master plan, MPG has estimated it needs about $1 billion, including $430 \nmillion for road maintenance and $570 million for road rehabilitation and reconstruction. To meet \nthis demand, MPG, under its 10th Five-Year Plan, identified a total budget requirement of $655 \nmillion including the $570 million to rehabilitate about 4,770 km of state highways and district \nroads, and $85 million for maintenance. \n \n  3.  Expenditure and Financing \n \n24.  Budget allocated to the road sector is inadequate.  In FY2002, the total allocation to \nPWDGoMP amounted to $119 million equivalent comprising $71 million equivalent for capital \ninvestment and $48 million equivalent for recurrent cost. This is equivalent to 3.5% of the total \nstate budget of $3.4 billion.  Especially under the capital investment for FY2002, about $43 \nmillion  equivalent  had  been  earmarked  to  repay  the  bonds  issued  for  roads  under  BOT \narrangement, leaving $23 million for rehabilitation of roads. Under the recurrent costs, $32 \nmillion  equivalent  (or  67%)  was  spent  on  emoluments  for  labors  assigned  for  routine \nmaintenance. This left a small budget of $16 million equivalent for road maintenance  and \nmaterials.  This could only meet the costs of routine maintenance for about 1,600 km of roads \nper year, or only 11% of the state road network. Based on information available, a preliminary \naudit of road expenditures and financing revealed that there was no (i) development planning \nand  programming  for  investment  projects,  (ii)  internal  budgeting  principles  and  monitoring \nsystem for spending, or (iii) financial management and financial accounting systems. Actual \nbudget utilization use depended highly on preference of PWDGoMP management, which may \ndiffer every year.  \n \n25.  PWDGoMP has been force account unit of MPG to implement infrastructure construction \nworks. Its performance is monitored and evaluated by total spending against the total budget ", "6     \nallocated. A detailed review6 of PWDGoMP\u2019s budget allocation and use has shown that its \nbudget  proposals  and  investment  plans  lack  technical  support  in  project  identification  and \nevaluation. \n \n  4.  Public-Private Partnership (PPP) and BOT \n \n26.  MPG has amended the Indian Tolls (Madhya Pradesh) Act to facilitate private sector \nparticipation in road projects. It has completed 17 major bridges under BOT and maintenance of \ntwo  roads,  the  Bhopal-Dewas  and  Mhow-Neemuch  roads  under  maintain-operate-transfer \n(MOT) arrangements. Construction of Mandsaur and Shivpur bypasses has been completed \nunder BOT while bypasses to Katni and Satna towns are in progress under BOT. MPG has \npassed the Madhya Pradesh Infrastructure Fund Board Act (MPIFBA) to encourage public-\nprivate partnership (PPP) in Madhya Pradesh's road sector. MPG is currently reviewing the \noperation modalities of BOT and MOT through bond roads and government subsidy schemes to \ndraw  lessons  and  experiences  to  improve  its  second  phase  operation.  Findings  and \nrecommendations of the review will be inputs for further updating and improving of MPG\u2019s \ninitiatives for promoting private sector participation in its road sector. \n \n27.  The Madhya Pradesh State Bridge Development Corporation (MPSBDC) is a statutory \ncorporation  under  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Minister  of  Public  Works  and  is  responsible  for \nimplementing  road  projects  involving  private  sector  participation,  including  BOT  and  MOT \nprojects, financed through bonds raised in the capital markets with government guarantee and \ngrants  from  PWDGoMP's  capital  investment.  Under    MPIFBA,  approximately  $23  million \nequivalent has been reallocated from PWDGoMP's road maintenance budget to MPSBDC in FY \n2003 to repay bonds. MPSBDC was revived in 2001 following the recommendation of the \nongoing ADB loan for public resource management. MPSBDC has been given the task of \nimproving 15 state highways and one national highway through a public-private partnership form \nof  BOT.  MPSBDC  specifies  design  criteria,  detailed  engineering  design,  bill  of  quantities, \napplicable toll rates (Rs0.25/km), a concession period of 15 years, and invites proposals from \nprequalified firms in the private sector. These firms compete on the amount of construction \nsubsidy to be required from MPG. MPSBDC has concluded agreements for 15 contracts.  The \naverage MPG's grant contribution is 48% of the total construction cost. MPSBDC conducts its \noperation transparently and is a very lean organization, outsourcing most of the professional \nexpertise and services to the private sector. \n \n28.  However, the application of this model to other state and major district roads is limited by \ntheir low traffic volumes. The 15 state highway and 1 national highway under this scheme total \nabout 2,200 km and carry, together with the national highways in Madhya Pradesh, about 85% \nof the state\u2019s total traffic. The rest is unlikely attractive to private sector participation. Therefore, \nthe main challenge faced by MPG is to improve substantially state road management and \noverall  performance  of  PWDGoMP  by  improving  governance  and  building  basic  technical \ncapability and institutional capacity to ensure delivery of reliable road transport services to \nsupport its economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n  5.  ADB Sector Strategy \n \n29.  The roads in India can be grouped into four segments, i.e., key national highway links \nunder the jurisdiction of the National Road Authority of India (NHAI), other national highway \nlinks under the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, state and district roads under state \n                                                 \n6  PPTA Consultants\u2019 draft final report for TA No. 3751-IND. ", "    7 \nPWDs, and rural roads under the Ministry of Rural Development. Given the potential scale of \nlending, ADB developed a holistic approach under the Western Transport Corridor Project in \n20017, whereby projects should be developed in a sequential and progressive manner to fulfill \nADB\u2019s long-term policy objectives of enabling efficient and sustainable development of roads to \nmeet the needs of the public for increased mobility and efficient freight movement. Specific \ninterventions in the road sector will differ since each of the four segments faces different \nchallenges. \n \n30.  Following the above model, a sector reform plan for reforming and developing the state \nroad sector in the next 5-10 years has been prepared to achieve the following policy objectives: \n \n(i)  full transition of state road sector management from the outdated PWD system to \na more effective and efficient system, the proposed State Highway Authority \n(SHA), with improved governance and accountability; \n(ii)  institutional strengthening and capacity building to improve business process and \nenhance effectiveness and efficiency of the state road sector management, \n(iii)  outsourcing  of  professional  services  to  bring  about  better  private  sector \nparticipation in road development projects and road maintenance; and \n(iv)  establishment of a road asset management mechanism and sustainable funding \nof road maintenance. \n \n31.  ADB operations in India and coordination with other major donors are discussed in \nAppendix 2.  The proposed SDP is the first state-level ADB intervention in the road sector. \n \nC.  The Rationale \n \n32.  The current PWD system in Madhya Pradesh, constrained by the identified institutional \nand policy constraints can not perform responsibly and be accountable for effective sector \nmanagement. It has resulted not only in rapid and dramatic deterioration of state road network \nbut also substantial decrease in road use because of unreliable road transport services, and \nalmost no transport services to the rural poor. This, in combination with inefficient management \nand  scarce  financial  resources,  has  constrained  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  social  and  economic \nprogress. Serious overstaffing of PWDGoMP exhausts about 67% of the total annual recurred \nexpenditures,8 or about 29% of the total budget, reducing the amount of funding for road \nmaintenance. This also contributes to substantially reduced incentive of PWDGoMP staff, poor \ngovernance, and an almost nonperforming infrastructure management. \n \n33.  Sector reform is crucial to rectify this situation, and enable MPG to manage state roads \nbetter, and ensure reliable road transport services to support the state\u2019s economic and social \ndevelopment.    The  reform  will  help  foster  good  governance  in  public  administration  and \naccountability in public resource and asset management for the state road sector. Improving the \nsector capability and capacity will enable a transparent and conducive environment for more \ncompetition, which in turn will ensure better infrastructure facilities and decrease in recurrent \ncosts  for  road  maintenance  over  the  medium-  and  long-term.  The  reform  will  also  initiate \nestablishment of an enabling environment which will encourage more private sector participation \nin road projects by outsourcing professional services for road development and maintenance \nprojects  through  competition  and  use  of  performance-based  contracts.  These  together  will \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2001.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on the Proposed Loan to India \non Western Transport Corridor Project. \n8  Non-planned budget is for recurrent expenditures. ", "8     \nfurther offset the financial burden of MPG by reducing demand on public sector resources and \nenabling higher expenditures and capital investment on priority social sectors and poverty \nreduction.  Besides,  the  investment  component  will  generate  constructive  employment \nopportunities and benefit other sectors, thereby contributing to poverty reduction. \n \n34.  The main reform objective of the SDP can be achieved in about 3 years. Once this \nobjective is achieved, further interventions will be implemented to achieve the remaining policy \nobjectives, of the sector reform plan to make the SHA an autonomous road agency, sustain the \nasset base through more active private sector participation, and ensure reliable road transport \nservices. In support of the reform objective, a project loan will be provided to rehabilitate \ndramatically deteriorated state road corridors to defer huge reconstruction cost until Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s economic growth and traffic justify financing major reconstruction projects. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \n \nA.  Objectives and Scope \n35.  The main objective of the SDP is to enable MPG to establish more effective and efficient \nmanagement of state roads and ensure reliable road transport services to support Madhya \nPradesh\u2019s  social  and  economic  development,  and  thus  reduce  poverty.  The  objective  is \nexpected to be achieved by (i) instituting measures for good governance in the administration \nand management of the sector, improving capability and building capacity for effective road \nasset management, improving road transport services and road safety, and initiating steps for \nbetter private sector participation; and (ii) rehabilitating priority state road corridors that have \ndeteriorated significantly. The program and project frameworks are given in Appendix 3. \n \nB.  Important Features \n36.  Figure 1 of Appendix 9 illustrates the macroeconomic linkages of the proposed sector \nreform. Reforming the state road sector will enable MPG to manage more effectively manage \nstate roads and ensure reliable road transport services to support Madhya Pradesh\u2019s economic \nand  social  development  through  two  main  channels.  The  first  channel  includes  improving \ngovernance  in  public  administration  and  accountability  in  public  resource  and  asset \nmanagement  for  state  roads.  Improving  the  sector  capability  and  capacity  will  create  a \ntransparent environment conducive for increased efficiency and competition. This in turn will \npromote  higher  quality  construction  and  road  maintenance  and  more  sustainable  road \ninfrastructure, and decrease recurrent costs of road maintenance over the medium and long \nterm. The second channel includes identifying sources of road sector revenue to establish a \nsustainable road maintenance funding mechanism. The sector reform will encourage private \nsector participation in road projects, which will offset the financial burden to MPG and enable \nmore  funding  of  priority  social  sectors  such  as  health  and  education  to  support  poverty \nreduction. Further, the reform will generate employment opportunities in other sectors, thereby \ncontributing indirectly to poverty reduction.  \n ", "    9 \nC.  The Program Loan \n1.  Objectives \n37.  The main objective of the Program is to enable MPG to establish a strong institutional \nframework for more effective and efficient state road management.  \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n38.  A policy matrix for the Program (Appendix 4) reflects the commitment of the Government \nand MPG to reorganizing PWDGoMP. The Program builds on the following policy themes: (i) \ngood governance in road sector management and administration and road sector resource \nmanagement, (ii) preservation and management of road asset, (iii) capacity building to improve \ninstitutional  effectiveness  and  efficiency,  and  (iv)  establishment  of  a  favorable  regulatory \nframework for private sector participation. Improvements in good governance and resource \nmanagement will be key intervention focusing on efforts for more transparent and accountable \nbudget allocation and use, and generation of more sustainable sector revenues for state road \ndevelopment and maintenance. \n \n39.  The program will require MPG to undertake a number of policy actions, that are tranche \nrelease conditions. MPG will (i) set up a state highway zone (SHZ) within PWDGoMP as an \ninterim  measure,  with  necessary  staffing  and  institutional  authority  to  integrate  key \nresponsibilities and functions for state road management, implement the SDP, and prepare for \ntransforming the SHZ into the SHA; (ii) transform of the SHZ into the SHA as a self-contained \nand fully functional agency to take over state highway management; (iii) staff the SHA, at \nheadquarters and regional levels, with the right skills mix to make the SHA a lean and efficient \norganization responsible for road sector policy, resource management, development planning \nand asset management (Supplementary Appendix A); (iv) implement modern planning and \ndecision-making  tools  and  prepare  five-year  and  annual  road  sector  development  and \nmaintenance plans based on economic and other clearly-defined sector performance criteria; (v) \nimprove  internal  business  processes  to  enhance  operational  and  financial  efficiency, \nmanagement  accountability,  transparency,  and  service  quality;  (vi)  implement  a  staff \nrationalization program as approved by MPG through a labor rationalization program (LRP) \n(Supplementary Appendix B), following the Government\u2019s VRS for government employees and \nstatutory reduction of labor following the Industrial Dispute Act 1947 to free more funds for road \nmaintenance  works;  (vii)  secure  adequate  budget  to  ensure  sustainable  funding  of  road \nmaintenance in the near term until a road maintenance fund can be established , and (viii) \nintroduce  effective  vehicle  overloading  controls  to  preserve  road  assets  and  road  safety \nprograms to reduce road deaths and injuries. The policy matrix in Appendix 4 gives the detailed \ntime-bound policy actions and reform measures to be undertaken by MPG and major outputs of \nthe Program. \n \n3.  Adjustment Costs and Financing Plan \n40.  To implement the reform measures, MPG is expected to incur a total adjustment cost of \n$80.2 million, including (i) $26 million for staff rationalization, (ii) $7.7 million for establishing and \ncommissioning the SHA, (iii) $40 million for road maintenance for 5 years, from FY 2004\u20132008 \nin addition to the already allocated road maintenance budget of $85 million for the same period, \n(iv) $2 million for the overloading control program, (v) $3 million for a road safety program, (vi) \n$0.5 million for a study of road revenue and road user charges for a sustainable funding \nmechanism  of  road  maintenance  financing,  and  (vii)  $1  million  for  statewide  stakeholder ", "10    \nconsultation by SHZ-SHA on the implementation of the SDP, road transport services, road \nmaintenance, and socioeconomic impacts of road projects. \n \n41.  The Government has requested a program loan of $30 million from ADB's ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance 37% of the adjustment costs of the SDP. The loan will have a \n15 year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum; a front-end fee of 1.0%, (the front-end fee and commitment charge will be \npaid by the Borrower from its own resources), conversion options that may be exercised in \naccordance with terms of the draft program Loan Agreement, the loan regulations, and ADB's \nconversion guidelines; and other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Program Loan \nAgreement. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow \nunder ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) \nstatement that these choices were the Government\u2019s own independent decision and not made \nin reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Executing Agency \n42.  The Executing Agency for the program loan will be the Finance Department of the \nGovernment  of  Madhya  Pradesh  (FDGoMP).  FDGoMP  will  be  responsible  for  providing \nadequate  counterpart  funds  and  other  resources  required  for  implementing  the  Program, \ncoordinate  and  monitor  implementation  of  the  Program,  and  administer  the  program  loan \nproceeds.  PWDGoMP  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  and  implementing  the  reform \nmeasures on a day-to-day basis as the implementing agency to ensure that all loan conditions \nare met for timely tranche releases. \n \nb.  Procurement and Disbursements \n43.  The proceeds of the program loan will be used to finance the entire foreign exchange \ncosts (excluding local taxes and duties) of goods and services produced and procured from \nADB member countries other than items specified in the negative list (Appendix 5) in the \nProgram  Loan  Agreement,  and  imports  to  be  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources. The Borrower will be required to submit with each withdrawal application a certification \nthat the value of the country's total eligible imports is equal to or greater than the amount of \nADB's projected disbursements under the program loan in a given period. ADB will have the \nright to audit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the Borrower's certification. \n \nc.  Counterpart Funds \n44.  Counterpart funds generated by the program loan will be transferred by the Government \nto MPG and be used by it under arrangements satisfactory to ADB, to support the reform and \nmeet the adjustment costs associated with the SDP, as agreed upon by the Borrower. The \ncounterpart  funds  to  be  generated  from  the  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the \nGovernment to MPG under normal arrangements for the transfer of external assistance in \naddition to the funds transferred to MPG by the Government\u2019s transfers allocated annually to \nMPG.  The  Government  will  bear  the  foreign  exchange  risk  under  the  program  loan  in \naccordance with its policy. \n ", "    11 \nd.  Monitoring and Tranching \n45.  The program loan of $30 million will be released by two tranches. The first tranche has \nbeen designed to achieve the following objectives:  \n \n(i)  establish  effective  and  transparent  business  processes  to  improve \ngovernance in financial management, public procurement and road sector \nresource management;  \n(ii)  Initiate institutional reengineering including the implementation of the LRP \nand capacity building for MP\u2019s state road sector; \n(iii)  Improve road transport services and traffic safety management; and \n(iv)  Initiate a regulatory framework favorable for private sector participation. \n \nThe release of the first tranche of $12 million (anticipated in December 2002) is subject to \nfulfillment of the first tranche conditions stated in the policy matrix. \n \n46.  The second tranche has been designed to achieve the following objectives: \n \n(i)  establish a reliable and sustainable road asset management system by \nimproving  the  road  maintenance  system,  and  identifying  sustainable \nfunding sources and a mechanism for funding road maintenance. \n(ii)  reorganize PWDGoMP and transform the SHZ into the SHA by March \n2005; and \n(iii)  complete the road safety and overloading control programs.  \n(iv)  Complete implementation of the LRP. \n \nRelease of the second tranche of $18 million (anticipated in June 2005) is subject to fulfillment \nof the second tranche conditions, in particular, and satisfying the other policy measures stated \nin the policy matrix. \n \nD.  The Project Loan \n1.  Objectives \n47.  The project loan will rehabilitate the priority state road corridors that have deteriorated \ndramatically.  This will defer huge reconstruction costs that will result if rehabilitation is not \nundertaken immediately. \n \n2.  Components and Outputs \n48.  The  Project  is  design  to  rehabilitate  about  1,750  km  of  state  highways  and  rural \nconnector roads identified from important state road corridors. It will cover (i) state highways \nlinking with the north-south national highway corridor, important industrial centers, and major \ndistrict roads; (ii) state highways with relatively high traffic volume providing transport for the \npredominate agricultural production; (iii) other state highways in zones that could enhance \neconomic performance if they had better roads; (iv) connector roads in rural and economically \nbackward areas, to benefit the rural poor; (v) equipment necessary for PWDGoMP to ensure \nquality control, improve operational efficiency, and emergency relief; and (vi) consulting services \nfor construction supervision. Project roads will be selected based on (i) social and economic \ndevelopment requirements, (ii) geographical distribution for poverty reduction, (iii) traffic volume, ", "12    \nand (iv) environmental requirements and engineering alternatives. Detailed selection criteria are \nin Appendix 8. \n \n3.  Cost estimates and Financing Plan \n49.  The total project cost in 2002 prices is estimated at $261.2 million equivalent, including \n$180.1  million  of  foreign  exchange  cost  (69%  of  the  total  cost).  The  local  currency  cost, \nincluding taxes and duties, is estimated at $81.1 million equivalent (31 % of the total cost). The \ncost estimate includes contingencies, a front-end fee of 1% of the total project loan amount, a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, interest during construction, and a repayment of \n$350,000 for the portion of the project processing technical assistance (PPTA) fund exceeding \n$250,000. Details are summarized in Appendix 6. \n \n50.  The Government has requested ADB to provide a loan of $150 million equivalent from \nADB's ordinary capital resources to finance 81% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project, \nand 2% of total currency cost (57% of the total cost). MPG will finance from its own resources \nthe remaining 45% of the total Project cost including taxes, duties, the front end fee, interest \nduring construction, and commitment charges, and other associated costs. The financing plan is \nalso summarized in Appendix 6. MPG has assured ADB that it will ensure timely provision of \nadequate counterpart funds for the Project implementation. \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \na.  Executing Agency \n51.  PWDGoMP will be the Executing Agency  for the Project. Within PWDGoMP, the SHZ \nwill be the Implementing Agency during the transition period until the SHA and its regional \noffices are fully functional to be responsible for the day-to-day project implementation. \n  \nb.  Management and Organization \n52.  In August 2002, PWDGoMP established a project implementing unit (PIU) for the SDP \nand appointed a director of the PIU and a director of the SHZ. A Director of the PIU has been \nappointed, with one full-time engineer, two part-time engineers and a part-time accountant. \nPWDGoMP has agreed to fully staff the SHZ and the PIU along with the progress of project \nimplementation,  with  delegated  authority  and  financial  and  other  resources  required  for \nsuccessful implementation of the Project.  \n \nc.  Implementation Schedule \n53.  Detailed  engineering  designs  for  phase  I  civil  works  have  been  completed  and \nprocurement documents are ready for submission to ADB for review and approval by October \n2002 (para. 55). Prequalification is expected to start in November 2002. Tendering is expected \nto start by January 2003. Rehabilitation works are expected to commence in June 2003. Project \nimplementation, including preconstruction activities, is expected to be completed in  five years, \nfrom January 2003 to December 2007(Appendix 7). \n \nd.  Procurement and Consulting Services \n54.  ADB approved advance procurement for phase I civil works and consulting services for \nconstruction supervision. All procurement to be financed under the loan will be carried out in ", "    13 \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts will be procured using \ninternational competitive bidding procedures (ICB) for contracts estimated to be equal to or \nabove $1.0 million equivalent. Phase I civil works have been divided into six contract packages \nto be tendered through ICB. Packaging of the remaining works will be finalized during Project \nimplementation with ADB\u2019s concurrence prior to bidding process. \n \n55.  Procurement of equipment includes that for (i) laboratory and material testing; (ii)  a \npavement management system; (iii) design computerization; and (iv) operation of the proposed \nSHA,  including  a  financial  accounting  system,  management  information  system  (MIS)  and \ncommunication system. The equipment to be financed under the project loan will be procured \nusing ICB procedures if the estimated contract amount is equal to or above $500,000, or \ninternational  shopping  if  the  amount  is  less  than  $500,000.  The  contract  packaging  for \nequipment supply contracts will be based on technical features of equipment to be required and \ntimed when it is required and will be finalized during project implementation (Appendix 8). \n \n56.  Terms of reference for construction supervision services are provided in Supplementary \nAppendix C. Construction supervision will be contracted to a team of international consultants in \nassociation with domestic consultants. The international consultants will provide senior resident \nengineers. The domestic consultants will include resident engineers for each contract package \nsupported by technical and administrative personnel. Most of the person-months will be used for \nconstruction supervision to ensure quality, and help PWDGoMP certify works and authorize \npayments.  The remaining person-month will be for an implementation consultant to assist \nPWDGoMP in contract management, dispute resolution, and other elements of contracting \nprocess, and to  train the counterpart staff. International consultants will also help establish a \nmonitoring and evaluation system, including a household survey and data analysis, and monitor \nthe implementation of social and environmental mitigation measures under the environmental \nmonitoring and management plan (EMMP) of the initial environmental examination (IEE). To \nsupport the monitoring and evaluation, a domestic consultant will be recruited to assist the \ninternational consultants to carry out household surveys and data analyses under the project \nperformance management system (PPMS). International consultants financed under the project \nloan  will  be  recruited  through  quality  and  cost-based  selection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. PWDGoMP has agreed to incorporate in all invitation \ndocuments and contracts for consultants the provisions of ADB\u2019s anti corruption policy. The \ndomestic consultants will be recruited in accordance with procedures satisfactory to ADB. \n \n57.  Under the consulting services for supervision, training will be organized for staff of the \nSHZ and the SHA on bridge maintenance, pavement management system, quality control, \nmaintenance planning and depot management, and social and environmental monitoring and \nmanagement. The training program and the proposed candidates will be submitted to ADB for \nprior review and approval. \n \ne.  Disbursement Arrangements \n58.  For civil works, procurement of equipment, and consulting services contracts, loan funds \nwill be disbursed using direct payment and reimbursement procedures, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan disbursement Handbook. \n \nf.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n59.  PWDGoMP will make arrangements satisfactory to ADB for reporting the progress of \nproject implementation. PWDGoMP will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports in such form ", "14    \nand  detail  as  ADB  may  reasonably  require  on  the  project  implementation.  The  results  of \nmonitoring the social and environmental impacts of the Project should be incorporated in the \nquarterly progress reports. PWDGoMP will prepare and submit to ADB within six months of \ncompletion  of  the  Project  Government\u2019s  project  completion  report  (PCR)  with  detailed \nassessment and evaluation of the design; implementation; project costs; the performance of \nPWDGoMP, ADB, consultants, and contractors; attainment of benefits; economic reevaluation; \nsocioeconomic and environmental impacts; and other details that ADB may require. \n \n60.  PWDGoMP will maintain for the Project separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, the expenditures incurred for the Project, and use of local funds. The accounts will be \nset up in accordance with sound accounting principles, and will be audited by independent \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The audited project accounts will be submitted to ADB within 9 \nmonths from the end of the previous fiscal year. MPG and PWDGoMP have been advised of \nADB\u2019s requirements for improving the compliance with timely submission of the audited project \naccounts,  and  the  possibility  of  suspending  disbursements  if  there  is  any  delay  in  the \nsubmission. \n \ng.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n61.  A set of indicators for estimating project effects in relation to the project goals, purposes, \noutputs, and conditions is in Supplementary Appendix D. Baseline indicators and target values \nwill  be  established  by  PWDGoMP  at  commencement  of  the  rehabilitation.  Subsequently, \nindicator values will be observed during project implementation, at project completion, 1 year \nafter project completion, and 5 years after project completion. MPG will recruit an international \nconsultant to help establish the PPMS, and train PWDGoMP staff and implementing agencies \nfor monitoring and evaluation (para. 57). \n \nh.  Project Review \n62.  In addition to ADB\u2019s regular and special reviews of the project implementation, MPG and \nADB will carry out a midterm review by the end of 2004. At that time they will review in detail the \nproject design and implementation progress to identify critical areas for strengthening and \nimprovement to ensure smooth implementation and achievement of the project objectives. The \nreview  will  focus  on  specific  measures  agreed  with  PWDGoMP  on  quality  control.  The \nmeasures include ADB's prior review and approval of the detailed engineering designs and \ntender documents, bid evaluations, and contracts; and project review missions and progress \nreports to review the performance of supervision consultants and contractors to ensure their \ndiligent performance. \n \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n \n63.  Capacity building for the Madhya Pradesh road sector needs to start from basic levels of \ndefining  new  structures  and  procedures,  updating  technology  and  skills,  and  improving \nmanagement. \n  \n64.  The objective of the technical assistance (TA) is to support road sector reform in Madhya \nPradesh. Consultants under the TA will also identify policy areas that need to be improved in \nline with the overall objectives of the SDP. It will also help MPG build the institutional capacity to ", "    15 \nstrengthen and develop state roads, and strengthen PWDGoMP's abilities in transport planning, \nproject  financing,  investment  management,  and  social  and  environmental  monitoring  by \nintroducing  internationally  recognized  principles  of  engineering;  technical,  financial,  and \neconomic analysis; and social and environmental impact assessment. The TA will provide a \nseries of training programs through seminars and workshops to disseminate findings of and \nrecommendations  on  program  implementation  and  improvement  of  the  state  road  sector \nmanagement. Overseas training programs may also be organized to expose senior government \nofficials and key management staff of PWDGoMP to road sector management, alternative \ntechniques for financial and economic analysis, and resource mobilization, especially in road \nmaintenance financing. \n \n65.  The TA will require about 84 person-months of international and domestic consulting \nservices  with  expertise  in  governance  and  policy,  transport  economics,  road  engineering, \nfinancial analysis, project costing and financing, financial accounting and management, and \nsocial and environmental management. The TA will provide training in these areas.  In addition, \nthe TA will provide equipment necessary for TA implementation. The total cost of the TA is \nestimated at $1.9 million: the Government of the United Kingdom will finance $1.5 million and \nMPG will finance the rest in kind from its own resources. ADB will be responsible for the \nadministration of the TA. The cost estimate and the outline terms of reference for the TA are in \nSupplementary  Appendix  E.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengagement of domestic consultants. \n \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS AND RISKS \n \n \nA.  Expected benefits \n \n  1.  Economic Analysis \n \n66.  Economic analysis indicates that the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the \nProject as a whole is 25%, while EIRRs by road sections for phase I project corridors range \nfrom 18.7% to 34.3%. EIRRs for specific road types are also higher than 12%.9  Thus, the \nProject  is  viable  as  a  whole  and  when  disaggregated  into  individual  lane  configurations. \nSensitivity analysis was carried out for six scenarios (i) capital costs increasing by 20%, (ii) \nbenefits decreasing by 20%, (iii) capital costs increasing by 20% and benefits decreasing by \n20%, (iv) time saving not counted, (v) capital costs increasing by 20% and benefits decreasing \nby 20% and time saving not counted, and (vi) start of construction delayed by 1 year. The \nresults of the sensitivity test for each corridor of the phase I civil works are given in Table 9 of \nthe Supplementary Appendix F. Under the worst scenario, (v), the EIRR for the Project as a \nwhole is 15.6%, while the EIRRs for two corridors go down to 11.6% and 10.4%. However, this \nsituation is unlikely to happen because the cost of rehabilitation is controllable due to the \nstraightforward  engineering  measures  and  because  no  land  acquisition  or  involuntary \nresettlement is involved. The current traffic levels are already the lowest possible. If construction \nstart is delayed by a year, the Project will lose economic benefits slightly because of a moderate \ndrop in the net present value (NPV).  Supplementary Appendix F provides detailed economic \nanalysis of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n9  32.1% for single lane roads, 26.3% for intermediate lane roads, and 22.8% for two-lane roads. ", "16    \n67.  The  economic  analysis  was  carried  out  using  the  Highway  Development  and \nMaintenance Tools (HDM). The HDM in principle evaluates investments on projects in the form \nof capital and recurrent costs against benefits derived from the savings of road user costs for \nsituations of \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project. The rapidly deteriorating road network, the current \ntraffic volumes, and future traffic forecast justify a rehabilitation program instead of upgrading \nand reconstruction. The rehabilitation will enable the road asset base to be preserved and thus \navoid the need to reconstruct the roads in the near future. It will also reduce requirements for \nperiodic maintenance. The improved road conditions are expected to attract more traffic and \neconomically justify further the improvement. In the economic analysis, the project life was \ntaken to be 20 years. \n \n68.  The analysis was carried out using generic traffic categories and road condition classes. \nBased on the current traffic mix, the overall traffic growth rate will be 6% per annum in the early \nyears, from the completion of the Phase I rehabilitation works in 2005, to 2012, 5 years after the \ncompletion of the whole Project. The traffic growth rate after 2012 will fall to around 5% per \nannum. The annual traffic growth is slightly lower than the average national traffic growth rate of \n7% because of the slower economic growth in net state domestic products at 5% per annum \ncompared to the 6% of the national average. Three rehabilitation options were considered \nbased on traffic level and road condition categories. The main quantifiable benefits of the \ninvestment are (i) savings in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) for existing traffic, (ii) VOC savings \nto generated traffic, and (iii) time saving. A minor component is the savings in maintenance \ncosts to be incurred by PWDGoMP. The VOC savings are generated through better road \nsurface conditions. As the access to markets, which reflects agricultural benefits, becomes \nbetter, increased economic activities will generate more traffic. \n \n69.  The HDM will enable PWDGoMP to plan and program the state road maintenance \nbudget so that resources are allocated according to where they will have the most economic \nimpact. This will improve resource allocation. The labor rationalization program will reduce \nredundant staff and increase financial resources for road maintenance works. The modern \nfinancial  management  systems  and  improved  business  processes  will  increase  use  of \ncompetitive bidding to obtain better prices and outputs in maintenance services.  \n \n2.  Poverty Reduction \n70.  Madhya Pradesh is one of the largest and most populated states in India, and  one of \nthe poorest.  About 38% of the 77 million people in the state live below the official poverty line, \ncompare to the national poverty incidence of about 35%.   \n \n71.  The Project is classified as poverty intervention and will directly contribute to poverty \nreduction by lowering the costs of transport for the poor traveling to labor markets, farmers\u2019 \nmarkets, and health and education centers. It will have a large effect on reducing poverty, \ndirectly benefiting 10 million people in a 30 kilometer zone of influence around the state roads to \nbe improved. Of these, an estimated 5 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, or about \n50% of the total direct beneficiaries.10 A detailed project beneficiary count and distribution of net \neconomic benefits of the Project are provided in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n72.  The benefits will become evident in higher agricultural product profit margins for poor \nfarmers, and lower cost and more timely access to schools, medical clinics, and employment \n                                                 \n10 Consultant final report  - Poverty Impact Assessment for the Government of Madhya Pradesh, under ADB TA \n3751-IND. ", "    17 \ncenters.  The  lower  transport  costs  will  increase  mobility  among  the  poor,  especially  poor \nwomen, who will be more easily able to reach social centers and become more politically active, \nthus increasing the empowerment of the poor.  \n \n73.  The estimates do not include the expected benefits to the poor of improving the tertiary \nrural connectivity roads, which is a project component. These additional benefits will likely be \nsubstantial, because they link poor farmers and their villages with the state roads, which are \ncurrently impassable during monsoon season. The rural connector roads to be included in the \nProject will be selected based primarily on poverty reduction criteria.   \n \n74.  The surveys reveal that 90% of the poor in the zone of influence use the Project roads, \nand that 33% of passengers on motorized vehicles, are poor. The surveys and focus groups \nshow that the degree of competition in the transport services market, including passenger and \nfreight services, varies depending on the condition of roads. On roads in better condition, there \nis more competition, while on roads in very worn condition, traffic is low and competition is \nweak. This suggests competition will become much stronger as the roads are improved during \nthe Project. With such heavy use of the roads by the poor, and competition hindered by weak \nroad  conditions,  the  Project  will  catalyze  competition  and  greater  service  frequency,  thus \nreducing passenger fares and freight rates and leading to even greater use of the Project roads \nby the poor. These findings underpin the estimates of the Project\u2019s estimated effects on the \npoor.  Appendix 9 provides a summary of the Poverty Reduction and Social Development \nStrategy \n \nB.  Social and Environment Impacts \n1.  Social Issues \n \n75.  The reform is expected to involve reduction of approximately 7,800 permanent and \n8,000  non-permanent  employees.  Among  the  permanent  employees,  about  26%  (2,000 \nemployees) would normally retire or leave within a 5 year period. A detailed workforce analysis \nand number of staff to be affected by the reform is given in Supplementary Appendix B. To \nensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Social Protection Framework, MPG has adopted a social safety \nnet program to provide job counseling, information services, and training. The counseling on \nother employment opportunities, and for safe and attractive investment of funds provided under \nthe labor rationalization program  for PWDGoMP, will be provided to all affected employees \nregardless of their employment status. Training programs will mainly target the nonpermanent \nemployees. \n \n76.  Consultants  under  a  World-Bank-financed  TA  loan  carried  out  an  initial  social \nassessment (ISA) for a road sector investment program in Madhya Pradesh.11  The ISA covered \nthe  scope  of  the  Project.  ADB  reviewed  the  ISA  and  confirmed  its  findings  and \nrecommendations  through  community  consultations  and  further  social  assessment,  which \nindicated  unanimous  support  for  road  improvement.  Poor  road  conditions,  resultant  traffic \naccidents,  and  road  congestion  particularly  in  urban  locations  are  key  reasons  for  public \nenthusiasm for improvement of the road network. In addition, small businesses by the roads \noffer a valuable source of income. The improvement of the corridor from Susner to Kilchipur, \nconnecting to the new bridge presently under construction, is expected to reduce travel distance \nby 128 km in western Madhya Pradesh. \n \n                                                 \n11  The TA loan did not result in an investment loan as envisaged. ", "18    \n77.  Based on community consultations and the social assessment, detailed engineering \ndesign of selected state highways will incorporate improvements to shoulders to enable safe \nroad access for pedestrians and slow moving traffic, bus stops with seating, wayside amenities, \nand truck stops to minimize road congestion. Such amenities will be included to the extent that \nthey do not entail land acquisition and resettlement. The design will include information signs, \nand speed break near schools, hospitals, and congested areas. The social and poverty impact \nassessment has provided the basis for integrating social concerns and is part of the criteria for \nselecting the road sections (Appendix 8 and Supplementary Appendix G). \n \n2.  Resettlement \n \n78.  The selection criteria and technical design have recommended road improvements that \nwill  not  entail  land  acquisition  or  involuntary  resettlement.    No  encroachments  or  other \nstructures will be dismantled. MPG and PWDGoMP have ensured ADB that, prior to the award \nof  civil  works  contracts,  each  road  package  will  be  screened  to  exclude  such  involuntary \nresettlement effects. MPG and PWDGoMP will monitor compliance with this condition fully \nduring  project implementation.  \n \n3.  Indigenous People \n \n79.  About  20%  of  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  population  are  \u201cscheduled  tribes  and  scheduled \ncastes\u201d.12  As the Project is confined to existing roads, such groups within the project area will \nnot be affected or disadvantaged by the Project. The improved road network will improve their \naccess  to  services  and  economic  opportunities  as  well  as  for  all  segments  of  the  state \npopulation.  \n \n4.  Environmental Aspects \n \n80.  The  Project  is  classified  as  a  B  project.  The  IEE  has  verified  that  the  limited \nenvironmental impacts during construction and operation can be mitigated by implementing the \nenvironmental  management  action  plan  as  recommended  by  the  IEE.  No  environmentally \nsensitive areas will be disrupted by the Project. (SIEE is in Supplementary Appendix H) \n \n81.  The IEE shows that environmental impacts associated with the Project are manageable \nand can be mitigated. Therefore, a full Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is not required.  \n \n82.  Although, no national park, natural reserve, or forest sanctuaries are within the Project \narea, some wild animals have been reported in the Project area. Therefore, a rapid wildlife \nmovement study has been undertaken in the Project area connecting Sagar and Bina. The \nfindings show that the Project will not affect the movement and habitat of the wildlife identified. \nThe study recommended fencing and underpasses to protect wildlife movement and ensure \ncompliance  with  ADB\u2019s  policies  and  guidelines  for  environmental  protection  and  the \nGovernment/MPG policies and regulations.  \n  \n83.  To support the sector development initiative, a social and environmental management \nunit will be established within the SHZ\u2019s PIU for the SDP, following example of the Environment \n                                                 \n12 \u201cScheduled Tribe\u201d is one of the weaker sections of Indian population.  Article 342 of India Fundamental Rights \nwhich are enshrined in the Constitution that \u201cScheduled Tribe\u201d is defined as specific tribes or tribal communities or \nparts of or groups within tribes or tribal communities. \"Scheduled Caste\u201d is defined as the lowest caste in the Hindu \ncaste system. \n ", "    19 \nand Social Development Unit within the National Highway Authority of India. The unit will be \nresponsible  for  environmental  management,  including  monitoring  the  implementation  of \nmeasures to mitigate social and environmental impacts and capacity building in undertaking the \nresponsibilities for the SHZ and the SHA. \n \nC.  Project Risks and Safeguards \n84.  Risks to the sector reform relate to MPG\u2019s policy commitment and abilities in making \npolicy changes and mitigating adverse impacts. This can be mitigated by MPG\u2019s strong reform \ninitiatives to resolve labor issues and to reengineer PWDGoMP.  Such commitments has been \npartly evident in the implementation of the VRS for the public sector enterprises, and the closure \nof some of them.  However, the road sector reform is the first time when government employees \nwill be offered a VRS. Additionally, ADB will continue policy dialogue with MPG to ensure that \nreform objectives are well understood and implementation arrangements are well in place. \nMeanwhile, the tranching and monitoring of the compliance with tranche release conditions \nhave  incorporated  time-bound  reform  action  plans  and  measures  to  ensure  successful \nimplementation of the reform. The TA associated to the SDP will strengthen PWDGoMP\u2019s \nimplementation capacity and assist PWDGoMP in implementing the reform. \n \n85.  Risks  for  investment  are  limited  to  quality  control  due  to  PWDGoMP\u2019s  limited \nimplementation capacity for effective contract management and supervision of works. This can, \nhowever, be mitigated by consulting services for construction supervision and capacity building \nprograms for PWDGoMP on contract management and quality control. Contracts have been \ndivided  into  relatively  large  packages  to  attract  international  and  large  qualified  domestic \ncontractors, to ensure good performance and high quality construction. Lessons learned from \nsimilar  projects  showed  that  concerns  are  rising  on  quality  control  and  performance  of \nconsultants  and  contractors  during  project  implementation.  These  will  be  addressed  by \ndiscussing improving potential problems before project implementation starts so PWDGoMP is \nready to handle them should they occur, ensuring ADB's prior review and approval of scope of \nworks, technical specifications, and tender documents. MPG has agreed with ADB to have \nintensive reviews of implementation,  consultants, and contractors. The project selection criteria \nand technical design recommended road improvements that will not entail land acquisition and \ninvoluntary  resettlement.    Project  impacts  on  the  environment  will  be  limited  and  can  be \nmitigated (para. 80 to 83). \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n86.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the Loan Agreements. \n \n(i)  General:    The  Borrower  will  ensure  that  policy  actions  described  in  the \nDevelopment Policy Letter and Policy Matrix (Appendix 4) prior to the date of \nloan effectiveness, will continue to be in effect for at least the duration of the \nSDP. ", "20    \n \n(ii)  Sector Reform: \n \n(a)  MPG will ensure that the responsibility and authority for state highway \nmanagement are effectively integrated and vested in the SHZ to be later \ntransferred to the SHA to be established by MPG. \n(b)  MPG will have PWDGoMP ensure that the capacity building and training \nprograms for PWDGoMP staff and evaluation of the programs are carried \nout  diligently  to  the  satisfaction  of  MPG  and  ADB,  and  necessary \nmeasures are adopted to ensure that trainees will remain in service for at \nleast 2 years after the completion of the training. \n \n(iii)  Environment: \n \n(a)  PWDGoMP will ensure that the Project is carried out, and all project \nfacilities are designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and monitored \nin compliance with the existing environmental laws and regulations of the \nBorrower  and  the  State,  and  the  ADB\u2019s  environmental  assessment \nrequirements  (1998)  and  the  Environmental  Guidelines  for  Selected \nInfrastructure Projects (1993). \n(b)  PWDGoMP  will  ensure  that  all  environmental  mitigation  measures \nidentified in the summary IEE, IEE, and Environmental Monitoring and \nManagement Plan (EMMP) are incorporated in the project design and are \nfollowed through during construction, operation, and maintenance of the \nProject roads with the consultation with the stakeholders. \n(c)  Local communities are duly consulted during the Project Implementation \nperiod on such measures. \n(d)  PWDGoMP will conduct training on environmental management for its \nstaff and contractors under the Project. \n(e)  MPG  and  PWDGoMP  will  ensure  that  the  social  and  environment \nmanagement unit within the SHZ and later the SHA is established and \nresponsible  for  environmental  management,  including  monitoring  the \nimplementation of the EMMP. \n(f)  Before any works are done on roads that pass by or through wildlife \nhabitat, an IEE that includes an assessment of wildlife movement should \nbe completed \n(g)  No construction work can be undertaken on any project roads before the \nno-objection  clearance  has  been  obtained  from  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s \npollution control board, forest department and environmental protection \ndepartment. \n(h)  Civil works contractors will provide appropriate traffic signs, fencing and \nunderpasses, where required. \n \n(iv)  Social Measures: MPG will have PWDGoMP ensure that technical design for \nthe road rehabilitation works under the Project does not require land acquisition, \nand that prior to award of civil works contracts, each road rehabilitation package \nwill  be  screened  to  exclude  involuntary  resettlement  effects.  MPG  and \nPWDGoMP will monitor compliance with this condition. ", "    21 \n \n(v)  Labor Rationalization of PWDGoMP: \n \na.  MPG  will  ensure  that  PWDGoMP  develops  and  implements  a  public \nawareness campaign and consultative process on labor rationalization to \ninform the stakeholders on the voluntary retirement scheme and other \nbenefits offered under the LRP.  \nb.  Prior  to  the  implementation  of  the  LRP,  PWDGoMP  establishes  a \nconsultative  working  committee  on  labor  issues  related  to  the \nimplementation of the LRP comprising representatives from FDGoMP, \nPWDGoMP  and  Labor  Department  of  the  Government  of  Madhya \nPradesh (LDGOMP) in accordance with each Department\u2019s mandate as \nstipulated in the Government\u2019s Rules of Business.  \nc.  PWDGoMP develops and implements the LRP with full participation of all \nthe  stakeholders,  including  effectively  disseminating  the  relevant \ninformation and seeking feedback on the LRP from its employees. \nd.

This sector analysis supplements the analysis in the main text and focuses on analysis \nof  the  current  road  maintenance  system.  Madhya  Pradesh\u2019s  road  network  is  substantially \ndeteriorated due to the lack of funding for maintenance and poor management in the past \ndecade. Of a total 38,000 kilometers (km) of state and major district roads, 25% is in very poor \ncondition and only 10% in fair condition; the remaining 65% is in poor condition.  This is mainly \nattributable to three factors: \n \n(i)  Lack of funding for road maintenance and lack of effective overloading control \nhave resulted in severe damage of most of the road network and part of the rural \nroads.  \n(ii)  The  road  maintenance  equipment  is  inadequate  and  obsolete,  and  Madhya \nPradesh Government (MPG) can not finance restoring the equipment to meet \nminimum requirements for road maintenance.  \n(iii)  The  Public  Works  Department  of  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \n(PWDGoMP) has very limited expertise and technical staff qualified for road \nmaintenance.  \n \n2.  Except on the high-traffic state road sections of about 2,000 km, contracted through \nbuild-operate-transfer(BOT) to the private sector for rehabilitation, no periodic maintenance or \nmajor repairs have been carried out on Madhya Pradesh roads in the past decade. Routine \nmaintenance has been carried out by labor without any technical capacity or required skills. \nPWDGoMP has a very poor maintenance planning and management system.  \n \nA.  Existing Road Maintenance Activities \n3.  The  maintenance  system  based  on  the  standard  Public  Works  Department  (PWD) \nmanual was produced almost a century ago and modified from time to time. The manual lacks \ninstructions for financial authority and performance monitoring and evaluation indicators, but \nprovides guidelines on duties, working procedures and administration procedures. The PWD \nmanual specifies  (i) establishment of the department, (ii) works to be carried out, (iii) special \nrules for irrigation and navigation, and (iv) work accounts.  The manual defines the operations of \nthe  PWD  as  (i)  original  works,  new  works,  alterations,  additions;  and  (ii)  repairs  and \nmaintenance. \n \nB.  Organizational Arrangement for Road Maintenance \n4.  The  following  positions  form  a  management  tree  with  key  responsibilities  for  road \ndevelopment and maintenance. They cover decisions on planning, budget preparation and \nallocation, assignment of tasks, implementation arrangements, monitoring, and evaluation of \nperformance.  It comprises (i) principal secretary, (ii) secretary, (iii) engineer-in-chief, (iv) chief \nengineers for zones, (v) superintendent engineers, (vi) executive engineers, (vii) subdivisional \nengineers, and (viii) subengineer (technical assistants).  \n \n \n5.  Detailed  responsibilities  of  the  positions  are  provided  in  the  following  sections  with \nspecific road maintenance activities. \n ", "24  Appendix 1 \nC.  Working Procedures \n6.  Three steps are required before any work other than repair can be executed by PWD \nwith its own funds can commence: \n \n(i)  administrative approval (concurrence from the competent authority), \n(ii)  technical  sanction  (sanction  based  on  detailed  estimates  by  competent \nauthority), and \n(iii)  appropriation  and  reappropriation  of  funds  (allotment  or  rejection  of  funding \nrequirement). \n \n7.  The two types of maintenance activities are: \n \n(i)  routine maintenance, which is performed by casual labor with minimum technical \nguidance and little supervision, and has no clear budget allocation except for \nsalary for labor and materials; and \n(ii)  periodic maintenance, which is carried out either on schedule or in response to \nneeds.  \n \nD.  Routine Maintenance Activities \n8.  Routine maintenance activities are normally carried out by the labor. Because of the \npoor governance and lack of transparency in the labor and financial management, the system \nno longer works. The labor crews have not been provided with appropriate tools and equipment \ndue to the scarcity of funds, or the tools provided are obsolete. \n \n9.  The distance covered by the crews is more than they can handle with the equipment \nprovided. The crews normally walk or bicycle to their work. All works under routine maintenance \nare arranged through direct engagement of local contractors who in turn hire the labor. Materials \nfor the routine maintenance are provided by the PWD, or locally procured by the PWD local \nbranch offices. \n \n10.  Routine maintenance normally includes patching; crack sealing; cleaning of ditches; \ndressing of slopes; trimming of tree branches; and white washing of safety posts, parapets, and \nhill cut slopes. \n \nE.  Periodic Maintenance \n11.  For  periodic  maintenance,  officers  in  charge  of  particular  sections  prepare  their \nproposals based on their inspections, which mostly visual without appropriate testing. They then \nprepare assessment reports and detailed itemized estimates of materials needed. Normally, \ndrawings are prepared manually for supplementary reference to the detailed estimates. \n \n12.  The estimates are mainly prepared for periodic maintenance activities scheduled over 6\u2013\n8 years. In most of the cases, the type of treatment is predetermined without any substantiating \ninvestigations on actual road conditions and performance indicators. \n \n13.  To carry out periodic maintenance activities generally known as \u201crenewals,\u201d PWD has \ntrucks, bitumen boilers, static rollers and drum mix plants. However, due to the ineffective \nrecovery of capitals, maintenance, and operational cost, the equipment has not been fully used ", "  Appendix 1  25 \nor maintained, and has become obsolete. No budget allocations have been made to operate or \nrefurbish the equipment. \n \n14.  Rates for manual and mechanized works normally used are published by PWD. The \nrates are estimates based on approved sources of material and established average lead \ndistances to the nearest sources. \n  \nF.  Business Process for Periodic Maintenance \n15.  The  business  process  for  periodic  maintenance  is  initiated  at  the  section  level  by \ncollecting data on road conditions and updating the maintenance activity chart based on the last \nperiodic maintenance. The estimates are then forwarded to subdivisional officers for scrutiny \nand verification, then to the divisional officer/executive engineer. The engineer compiles the \ndata  at  the  divisional  level,  with  details  of  the  previous  year\u2019s  allocation  to  the  sections \nconcerned. \n \n16.  The zonal level details are further compiled from each division by the chief engineer. The \nchief engineer prepares a summary estimate detailing the total number of kilometers to be \nmaintained, and number of structures to be repaired or replaced. These details are forwarded to \nthe engineer-in-chief. The engineer-in-chief compiles the data with the assistance of the chief \nengineer (planning) and issues job orders for periodic maintenance. There is no database on \nany of the road sections for either long term or short term planning use at PWD headquarters. \n \n17.  As  part  of  preparing  estimates  for  periodic  maintenance,  and  to  rationalize  the \nmaintenance program, the PWD manual specifies the following data collection frequencies: (i) \ntraffic count-twice a year, (ii) road condition-once a year, and (iii) condition of structure\u2014once a \nyear.  However, these are not being implemented due to lack of funding and expertise. \n \nG.  Budget Approval \n18.  The estimates prepared by the engineer-in-chief are proposed to the principal secretary \nalong  with  other  requirements  for  budget  approval.  However,  funds  allocated  are  barely \nsufficient to meet even 50% of the proposals. Based on the approved budget, the engineer-in-\nchief consults with the zonal chief engineers and chief engineer (planning) about distributing the \nfunds. The PWD criteria for distributing funds are highlighted in the following: \n  \n(i)  review of bar charts for the last 5 years on periodic renewal, \n(ii)  condition of the road and severity of the distress and the effect on delaying the \nplanned activity, \n(iii)  intervention criteria based on road condition and the available grant, \n(iv)  implementation arrangements, and \n(v)  identification of eligible contractors. \n \n19.  Contractors are registered according to their financial capability and equipment capacity. \nThe registrations are renewed or cancelled based on contractors\u2019 performance. The registration \nand classification of contractors have been revised following the provisions in the PWD manual. \nThe revised thresholds for the registration of contractor by class and person delegated authority \nto register these contractors are given in Table A. \n ", "26  Appendix 1 \nTABLE A:  REGISTRATION THRESHOLDS \nClass  Financial Capability  Authorized  Contact  Person  for \nContractor\u2019s Registration \n     \nA-I  Rs 1 Million  Chief Engineer \nA-II  Rs 5 Million  Chief Engineer \nA-III  Rs 10 Million  Engineer in Chief \nA-IV  Rs 40 Million  Engineer in Chief \n  Unlimited  Engineer in Chief \nSource:  PPTA final report and loan processing missions. \n \n \n20.  As part of the registration, contractors need to supply the certificates certified by the \nexecutive engineers. \n \nH.  Tendering \n21.  Periodic maintenance works are tendered to shortlisted contractors based on sealed \ntenders invited in an open and public manner by advertising in local or national newspapers. \nThe criteria for advertising are (i) up to Rs500,000 in regional or local newspapers in regional \nlanguage; (ii) Rs500,000 to Rs2,000,000 published at the district level in two newspapers and at \nthe state level in the regional language; and (iii) above Rs2,000,000,  published in English \nlanguage newspapers and two regional newspapers.  \n \nI.  Bid Evaluation \n22.  Bids are evaluated based on the guidelines provided in the PWD manual. The guidelines \nhave been updated recently, but have yet to be implemented. For bid evaluation, a committee is \nformed including staff from PWD and MPG. This is a recent development and the functions of \nthe committee are yet to be tested. \n \n23.  Bids are invited as open tenders from qualified and registered contractors. Based on the \nfinancial proposals and bid evaluation guidelines specified in the PWD manual, the PWD is \nconsidering adopting bid evaluation procedures and applications for national highways projects. \nThe evaluated bids based on the financial quotes are negotiated for the award of bids. \n \nJ.  Quality Control  \n24.  Combined teams of the PWD and the contractor\u2019s representatives normally carry out \nquality control. For small works, this mechanism is not practical. In most of the cases, this is not \nimplemented, resulting in no supervision and quality control. \n \nK.  Monitoring System for the Performance of Contractor\u2019s \n25.  Contractors  that  perform  poorly  are  not  allowed  to  bid  for  future  contracts.  New \nguidelines  are  yet  to  be  implemented  with  special  conditions  to  address  nonperforming \ncontractors or irregularities in their execution of contracts. Payments are usually late due to \nfunding constraints, and are made on a monthly basis. Contractors can not claim extra payment \nfor the delay or chose the mode of compensation. The superintending engineers arbitrate claims \nfor PWD. ", "  Appendix 1  27 \n \nL.  Recording and Measurement \n26.  Subengineers  record  measurements  to  be  agreed  by  contractors.  Subdivisional \nengineers check the measurements. The agreed and verified measurements are entered into \nthe  measurement  book.  The  measurements  are  verified  by  divisional  accountants,  who \nrepresent the Madhya Pradesh accountant general, before forwarding them to the executive \nengineers (payment officers) for final check and payment. The executive engineers check 10% \nof the total payments made. The measurement books are not used in current projects under \nAsian Development Bank and the World Bank assistance due to difficulties in reproducing or \nretrieving the data from the books. \n \n27.  The current road maintenance system needs major reform and restructuring. The current \nguidelines need to be substantially revised and updated following international norms, and other \nmore effective models in India, such as that implemented by the National Highway Authority of \nIndia.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \n1.  Investment in road transport at present and for the next decade is a priority for India \nbecause (i) continued economic growth is essential for India\u2019s efforts to fight poverty; (ii) road \ntransport infrastructure can deliver major benefits to the poor, both directly and indirectly; and \n(iii) the deficient road transport system is a key constraint for growth in India. \n \n2.  The  Government  of  India  has  recognized  this  key  constraint  and  has  placed  road \ntransport  as  one  of  the  major  priorities  in  its  current  investment  program.  In  addition  to \nmobilizing its own resources through a central road fund, the Government has sought a large \namount of financial and technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nthe World Bank, of about $2 billion per annum in the medium term. \n \n3.  To deliver the large program to India in an efficient manner given the limited resources \nfaced by both organizations, ADB and the World Bank have developed a coordinated strategy \nfor the road sector in India. Advantages of the coordinated strategy include (i) consistency in \npolicy advice, (ii) cost effectiveness and avoidance of duplication of effort, (iii) greater focus on \nresults through use of a common performance monitoring system, and (iv) operational synergy \nand complementary with each other in terms of sector knowledge and staff skill mix. \n \n4.  For the state road sector, a two-pronged strategy is being pursued. ADB and the World \nBank have separate focal states, and selectively support a number of nonfocus states that have \ngiven assurances that (i) the support will not be wasted due to corruption or poor governance, \nand (ii) that have an unusually high development or demonstration impact for a particular project \nbecause of its innovative nature, or  the issue of the reform being promoted is important. \n \n5.  Consistent with state governments\u2019 investment priority for state roads, ADB and the \nWorld Bank focused on capacity expansion of high traffic and high priority state road corridors \nand rehabilitation of high priority state roads to reduce the maintenance backlog. \n \n6.

Since 1988, ADB has provided 7 loans totaling $1,536 million, 1 TA loan for $12.7 \nmillion, and 23 TAs totaling $10.125 million to India\u2019s road sector. The World Bank and the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) are also involved in the road sector. The World \nBank has provided financing for 9 projects amounting to about $1.9 million to construct and \nrehabilitate rural roads, improve state highways, and widen national highways to four lanes. \nJBIC has provided 5 loans amounting to $263 million equivalent to upgrade national highways 2 \nand 5 to four lanes, and to construct a bridge across the Jamuna River at Allahabad-Naini. \nADB\u2019s assistance to the road sector is well coordinated with that of the World Bank and JBIC \nthrough regular consultations. A coordinated assistance strategy for the road sector in India is \nbeing prepared in consultation with the Government, World Bank, and other financing agencies.  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s sector strategy is to reduce road infrastructure bottlenecks on the key transport \ncorridors  to  support  India\u2019s  efforts  to  achieve  higher  sustainable  economic  growth.  ADB\u2019s \napproach is to promote efficiency in the delivery and maintenance of road infrastructure through \nappropriate policy measures and maximizing, where feasible, private participation. Within this \nstrategy, ADB\u2019s involvement in the road sector will focus on projects that have significant direct \nand indirect impacts on poverty reduction, facilitate subregional economic cooperation, and \npromote private sector development. Under the overall thrust of the focal state approach, ADB\u2019s \nstrategy for the state road sector focuses on reorganizing the outdated public works department \nsystem to improve its responsibility and accountability in sector management through instituting \ngood governance measures, modern managerial capabilities, and capacity for more effective \nand efficient sector management and operation, thereby ensuring more efficient use of limited \nfinancial resources to free more expenditures and capital for priority social sectors for poverty \nreduction. \n               ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nTable A9.2:  External Assistance to Road Sector \n \n \nA.

Contribution of the Sector Development Program (SDP) to Reduce Poverty \n1.  Madhya Pradesh is one of largest and the most populous states in India.  It is also one \nof the poorest in the country. About 38%  of the 77 million people in Madhya Pradesh live below \nthe official poverty line,  compared to about 35%  of the population living below the poverty line \nfor India as a whole. \n \n2.  The Program is classified as a poverty intervention and will directly reduce poverty by \nlowering the costs of transport for the poor traveling to labor markets, farmers\u2019 markets, and \nhealth and education centers.  The Program will have a large effect on reducing poverty, directly \nbenefiting 10 million people in a 30 kilometer zone of influence around the state roads to be \nimproved.  Of these, an estimated 5 million poor people will be direct beneficiaries, or about \n50% of the total direct beneficiaries.  \n3.   The estimated distribution analysis draws the selected road section and reflects that the \npoor and very poor are heavy users of motorized transit on the project roads and that as the \nroads  are  improved,  competition  in  passenger  and  freight  transport  markets  will  become \nstronger. Resultant lower transport costs will substantially be passed on to poor and very poor \npassenger and freight shippers. \n \n4.  For the baseline forecast, the estimated share of benefits accruing to poor and very poor \npassengers is the same as that in paragraph 3. For the net benefits accruing to freight shippers, \nthe fieldwork supports estimates that 60% of the net benefits will accrue to the poor and 50% to \nthe very poor,  who are included in the poor grouping. \n \n5.  These benefits will become evident in higher agricultural product profit margins and \nlower cost and more timely access to schools, medical clinics, and employment centers.  The \nlower transport costs will increase mobility among the poor, especially poor women, facilitating \ntheir  access  to  social  centers  and  enabling  there  to  become  more  politically  active,  thus \nincreasing the empowerment of the poor. \n \n6.  The estimates do not include the expected benefits to the poor of improving the tertiary \nrural connectivity roads, which is a project component. These additional benefits likely will be \nsubstantial, because they link poor farmers and their villages with the state road system, which \nare currently impassable during the monsoon season. The rural connector roads to be included \nin the Project will be selected based primarily on poverty-reduction criteria during the design \nphase of the Project.  \n \n7.  These estimates are based on surveys of over 150 passengers, 150 drivers, 50 freight \nshippers, and 27 residents in the zone of influence, along with 19 focus group discussions and \ndirect field observations on a carefully selected representative sample of 525 kilometers of the \nstate road system that will be improved by the Project.  This fieldwork was completed during \nMarch \u2013 April 2002.  The sample sizes and selected road segments are more than adequate to \nensure that the results can be generalized to the entire project. Results conform to available \nsecondary data and the results from key informant interviews.  Moreover, from a classical \nstatistical viewpoint, the sample sizes are adequate based on the observed degree of variation \nin the estimated parameters of the target populations.       \n \n ", "60  Appendix 12 \n8.  The surveys reveal that 90% of the poor in the zone of influence use the project roads, \nand that a third of passengers on motorized vehicles are poor. The surveys and focus groups \nshow that the degree of competition in the transport services market, including passenger and \nfreight services, varies depending on the condition of the road. On roads in better condition, \nthere is more competition, while on roads in very worn condition, traffic is low and competition is \nweak. This suggests competition will become much stronger as the roads are improved during \nthe Project. With the poor being such heavy users of the roads now, and competition hindered \nby weak road conditions, the Project will catalyze competition and service frequency, thus \nreducing passenger fares and freight rates, and leading to even more intense use of the Project \nroads by the poor. The findings underpin the estimates of the Project\u2019s estimated effects on the \npoor. \n \nB.  Participatory Process \n9.  Community  consultations  and  the  social  assessment  show  unanimous  support  for \nimproving state and rural roads. According to the residents, poor road conditions increase the \ncost of access by the poor to health clinics, schools, labor markets, and farmers\u2019 markets.  By \nimproving the project roads, the poor residents see that these costs will decline and that they \nwill have easier access to the key institutions that determine their quality of life. In the focus \ngroups, improved access ranked among the top three critical needs identified by participants.  \nOther top needs include improving the water management system, increasing the supply of \nelectricity, and lowering the cost of education. The consultations also showed that the poor, \nespecially the poor women, are concerned about road safety, and the lack of bus stops in the \nvillages and hamlets. Residents are aware that the bad road conditions and lack of access \nincreases the cost of retrieving farm inputs and delivering farm products to market, and that \nthese high transport costs cut their farm incomes. \n \n10.  Based on the findings and recommendations from the community consultations, the \ndesign  consultant  will  incorporate  improvements  to  shoulders,  to  improve  the  safety  for \npedestrians and nonmotorized traffic; covered bus stops with seating; wayside amenities; and \ntruck stops, to reduce road congestion where necessary.  The improvements will be done if they \ndo not entail land acquisition or resettlement. To address concerns about road safety, the \ndesign will include information signs and speed break near schools, hospitals, and areas heavily \ntrafficked by pedestrians, such as towns and market. \n \n11.  The design consultant and Public Works Department of the Government of Madhya \nPradesh (PWDGoMP) will create a consultative working group on labor relations, with stakeholder \nrepresentatives, to prepare, implement, and monitor a labor retrenchment plan for PWDGoMP.  \nThe working group will provide a forum for counseling, stakeholder participation, information \ndissemination, and coordination with other government agencies.  The design consultant will \nprovide a participation strategy to prepare, implement, and monitor the labor rationalization \nprogram (LRP). \n \nC.  Gender Issues \n12.  Research elsewhere in South Asia has shown that when access is difficult, men more \nactively participate in society than women.  When access improves, as it will under the Project, \nwomen become more mobile and more socially active; they will gain political empowerment and \nbe better able to reach the centers of political activity. The Project will thus increase women\u2019s \nempowerment. \n ", "  Appendix 9  61 \n13.  The  public  consultations  revealed  substantial  wage  differentials  between  men  and \nwomen providing the same labor.  The differentials favor men. The program will encourage \nemployment  targets  for  women  to  participate  in  road  construction  activities  and  require \ncontractors to pay the same wage to men and women for work of equal value. Targeting and \nproviding a quota for women in road rehabilitation will provide employment opportunities where \nsuch  opportunities  are  scarce,  and  allow  women  to  increase  family  incomes.  During  the \nrehabilitation phase the contractors will be required to provide service stations that will ease \nworking conditions for women who do take on the road works jobs.  A gender strategy is not \nrequired as a component of the Program. \n \nD.  Resettlement \n14.  The Program\u2019s optimal engineering solutions for road rehabilitation do not entail land \nacquisition  or  resettlement.  The  rehabilitation  works  will  be  within  the  existing  alignments, \nfocusing  on  improving  pavement,  drainage  and  shoulders.  The  program  will  not  entail \ndismantling of encroachments or land acquisition. Visual surveys along selected road sections \nindicated  few  exceptions.  The  existing  right-of-ways  are  adequate  to  accommodate  the \nproposed rehabilitation. \n \nE.  Indigenous People \n15.  Madhya Pradesh has about 20% of India\u2019s scheduled tribe population, with the Betul-\nParatwada corridor having a high tribal population of near 40%. The Project, however, will have \nno  significant  negative  impact  on  the  tribal  population.  Thus,  an  indigenous  people\u2019s \ndevelopment plan  is not needed.    \n \nF.  Labor Issues \n16.  The Project will ensure that the civil works contractors comply with all applicable labor \nlaws and do not employ children for construction or maintenance jobs. Contractors will be \nrequired to provide appropriate facilities for child dependants in construction campsites. \n \n17.  PWDGoMP employs 9,520 permanent staff and 20,000 casual workers, and is seriously \noverstaffed at the lower levels.  Institutional restructuring will require retrenching the labor force \nby about 30%.  Most layoffs likely will occur at the lower levels. To mitigate the social impact, \nthe Madhya Pradesh Government (MPG) will establish a social safety net mechanism following \nthe example of the program established under the previous ADB Madhya Pradesh Public \nResource Management Program.  The MPG will approve, with technical assistance, the LRP in \nOctober 2002. See Supplementary Appendix B for a summary of the LRP. \n \nG.   Other Social Risks and Vulnerabilities \n18.  The  primary  risks  to  project  implementation  are  (i)  executing  agencies  and  other \nstakeholders lacking capacity to address social and poverty issues (ii) overlaps between the \nDepartment  of  Labor  and  PWDGoMP  could  impede  an  effective  retrenchment  plan  and  (iii) \ncounterpart funds may be inadequate to implement the LRP. \n \n19.  The  project  design  incorporates  countermeasures  to  mitigate  these  risks.  The \nconsultative group on labor relations will mitigate the risk of conflicts between the Department of \nLabor and PWDGoMP regarding the LRP. \n ", "62  Appendix 12 \nTo mitigate the remaining risks, the Project will: \n \n(i)  design and implement the project performance management system that will provide \nfeedback for timely remedies \n(ii)  provide  institutional  support  to  PWDGoMP  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Department  of \nFinance during implementation \n(iii)  provide a long-term labor specialist to help implement the LRP  and \n(iv)  involve ADB in close supervision of the Project to correct any flaws in design or \nimplementation. \n \n20.  A very specific risk is that the poor may not be enable to capture the expected benefits.  \nTo ensure that the poor are able to capture these benefits, the design consultant will develop a \nprogram based on strong public participation in a number of workshops. These workshops will \neducate: \n \n(i)  poor farmers on to how to use commercial inputs and \n(ii)  poor farmers on how to best market their surplus products; \n(iii)  poor passengers on how to negotiate lower fares to reflect the cost savings going to \nthe bus and taxi drivers;  \n(iv)  poor shippers products on how to negotiate lower freight charges reflecting the \nimproved road conditions; and \n(v)  poor women on increasing their political and social involvement in the community. \n \n21.  The design consultant, together with the Executing Agency and ADB, will develop and \nimplement the project performance management system. The system will provide feedback on a \nnumber of indicators to show that the benefits are being passed to the users of the roads, \nparticularly  poor  users  of  the  roads  as  well  as  residents  in  the  zone  of  influence.  Some \nillustrative indicators that show the benefits being passed to the poor will include \n \n(i)  improved construction materials being used by residents, and poor residents, for \ntheir dwellings in the zone of influence; \n(ii)  increases in commercial sales of specific farm products, including rice, wheat, gram, \nand sorghum from the zone of influence; \n(iii)  lower passenger fares on improved roads; and \n(iv)  lower freight rates on improved roads. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "   \nFIGURE A9:  MACROECONOMIC LINKAGE OF ROAD SECTOR REFORM \n \n \nSTATE ROAD SECTOR REFORM\n   \n \n \n \n \n  Improved Governance  Improved Sector  Higher Sector  More Active Private Sector \nImproved \n  In Sector Management  Capacity and  Revenue Growth Participation Outsourcing of  Infrastructure/ \nCapability  Professional Services to Market \n  Road Transport \nServices \n \n \nReduced Fiscal \n \nBurden of MPG\n \n  More Efficient/Effective  Transparent, Conducive \n  Public Resource  Environment for more \n  Management Utilization  Economy, Efficiency and \nCompetition \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Decreased  Stable    Better Access  Better Access \nRecurrent Costs  Demand for  More  for Real  for the Poor \n \nfor Road  Massive  Constructive  Sectors to  to \n  Maintenance  Consumption  Employment  Resources  Mainstream \n  through Higher  Items  and Markets  Economy and \n  Quality  Opportunities\nConstruction and \n \nIncreased Credit  Higher Public  Maintenance \n  to Encourage  Expenditure \n  Private Sector  Capital for \n  Participation  Priority Social \nSector \n \n \n \n \nPoverty Reduction ", " \n \nTable A9.1: Poverty Impact Analysis Corridors: Estimated Beneficiaries and Very Poor Beneficiaries \n \n \nCorridor Number   Districts  Population  Proportion  Populati Km  Total  Very Poor \nand Name  2001  Very Poor  on  Benefits  Benefits \nVery \nPoor \n1.
