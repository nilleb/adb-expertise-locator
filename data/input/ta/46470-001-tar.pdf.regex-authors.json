INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  With a population of 1.43 billion people, one-third of whom live in poverty, South Asia \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs)1 face the challenge of achieving and sustaining rapid \neconomic growth to reduce poverty and attain other Millennium Development Goals in an era of \naccentuated  risks  posed  by  global  climate  change.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), \ntogether with key development partners, has been supporting South Asia DMCs in their pursuit \nto mainstream climate change in development plans, programs, and projects.2 This proposed \nregional capacity development technical assistance (TA) will support selected South Asia DMCs \nin pursuing low-carbon climate-resilient development.3 The design and monitoring framework of \nthe TA is presented in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA is in line with the regional cooperation strategy goal for capacity development of \nADB\u2019s  South  Asia  DMCs,  specifically  with  regard  to  providing  rapid  technical  response  to \nemerging global and regional issues such as climate change. The TA is also aligned with the \ncountry partnership strategy of each South Asia DMC on the common themes of environmental \nsustainability and building and/or strengthening climate resilience.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  South Asia is projected to experience extreme weather conditions and change in the \nfrequency and intensity of natural hazards as a result of climate change. Progressive warming is \nprojected over a wider geographic area in the region. Winter months are projected to become \ndrier and summer monsoon more intense with increased rainfall intensity and cyclone strength.4 \nSea-level rise will put settlements and vital infrastructure in coastal and island states at risk, and \nwill cause intrusion of saltwater into agricultural areas, affecting crop productivity in Bangladesh, \nIndia,  and  Sri  Lanka.5 Warming  will  destabilize  high-altitude  glaciers  in  the  Himalayas, \nendangering  lives  and  properties,  particularly  in  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  northern  India,  and \nNepal.6  \n \n4.  Economic losses in key sectors, such as agriculture, energy, transport, health, water, \ncoastal and marine, and tourism, are expected to be significant, rendering growth targets harder \n                                                \n1  Includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n2  Notable examples are (i) ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Supporting Implementation of the Bangladesh \nClimate Change Strategy and Action Plan. Manila. (TA 7273-BAN); (ii) ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for \nSupport for the National Action Plan on Climate Change. Manila. (TA 7417-IND); (iii) ADB. 2013. Technical \nAssistance for Mainstreaming Climate Change Risk Management in Development. Manila (TA 7984-NEP); (iv) \nADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Capacity for Climate Change Adaptation. Manila. (TA 7326-\nSRI); and (v) ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Regional Economics of Climate Change in South Asia II\u2013\nAdaptation and Impact Assessment. Manila. (TA 7423\u2013REG). \n3  This work is a continuation of a current SARD program\u2014Climate Action South Asia (CASA), which has been \nsuccessful and appreciated by the DMCs. Stakeholder consultation in the six South Asia DMCs identified four key \nareas of support: (i) climate change risk assessment, (ii) technology transfer and demonstration projects, (iii) \ncapacity building, and (iv) knowledge development and sharing (ADB. 2013. Regional Workshop on Climate Action \nSouth Asia: Steering Economies Toward Low-Carbon and Climate-Resilient Development. 5\u20137 March). \n4  ADB. 2010.

Holistic and coordinated support will enable South Asia DMCs to (i) increase overall \ncapacity  to  cope  with  the  current  and  unavoidable  impacts  of  climate  change;  (ii)  more \neffectively and strategically incorporate climate change and disaster risk management in the \nplanning, design, and implementation of policies, projects, and programs; (iii) apply technologies \nand  best  practices  to  enhance  adaptation  and  mitigation  response;  and  (iv)  improve  and \nstrengthen private sector participation in high impact adaptation and mitigation activities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact of the TA will be the successful transition to a low-carbon and climate-\nresilient development path in South Asia. Its outcome will be the increased investment and \ninstitutional capacity of South Asia DMCs to manage the impacts of climate change. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  The TA has the following outputs: (i) screening of investment projects against climate \nrisks strengthened; and (ii) capacity of DMCs in developing and/or implementing climate change \nstrategies and action plans strengthened. A phased and targeted approach will be used in \nimplementing a set of activities, which will involve demonstrating and piloting risk assessment \ntools and designing adaptation and mitigation responses in selected projects in the early phase, \nfollowed by application and extension across as many projects and countries as possible in the \nSouth Asia DMCs.7 \n \n7.  Output 1: Screening of investment projects against climate risks strengthened. \nThe TA will support screening of ADB-assisted projects in selected South Asia DMCs for climate \nchange risks, and provide early inputs into project planning, design, monitoring, and reporting. \nScreening will involve project-level assessment of risks and recommendation of adaptation \nresponse  through  the  use  of  high-resolution  downscaled  climate  information  and  data.8 \nOrganization  and  maintenance  of  the  downloaded  climate  information  and  data  will  be \nestablished to provide sector- or country-level assessment.9 For mitigation, the TA will assess \nmethodologies for calculating project- and sector-related emissions and identify the potentials \nfor carbon dioxide emission reduction during the early stages of project preparation. With the \ndetailed risk screening and systematic identification of mitigation potentials in place, a basis for \nidentifying and selecting specific adaptation options and mitigation measures can be established \nat the appropriate stage during project development. Workshops on risk assessment, adaptation \n                                                \n7 Three of ADB\u2019s six South Asia DMCs (Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka) will be separately targeted for (i) \ninnovation in technology, business model and financing, and pilot demonstration; and (ii) capacity building, regional \nknowledge sharing, and experiential learning activities in the later phase of the TA. These countries were selected \nbecause of their low per capita gross national income, and relatively high exposure and vulnerability to climate \nchange impacts. The scope of TA will be expanded to include country-specific themes as supplementary funds are \nmade available. In designing and implementing specific activities in each country, links and synergies with other \nADB and development partners supported projects and facilities will be established. Further details on required \nsupport to South Asia DMCs, its scope, and expert inputs are described in the supplementary appendix. \n8  The screening framework developed under the Technical Assistance for Preparing for Climate Action South Asia \n(ADB. 2012. Preparing for Climate Action South Asia. Manila [TA 8292-REG].) will be further strengthened and \nused, and other screening tools will be applied whenever feasible. The TA will also support sector-specific \nmodeling activities to provide more relevant inputs, e.g., stream flow, run-off, and inundation levels. \n9  For cost efficiency and sustainability, the databases will be linked to similar ADB initiatives such as the ADB. 2013. \nTechnical Assistance for Regional Climate Projections Consortium and Data Facility in Asia and the Pacific. Manila \n(TA 8359-REG). This database will be used to support the development of Country Partnership Strategies (CPS) \nand other strategic plans and programs. \n ", "3 \npractices, mitigation measures, and monitoring, reporting, and verification at the project level will \nbe conducted to further strengthen the effort of DMCs towards low-carbon and climate-resilient \ndevelopment. Overall, the TA will (i) develop or adopt and apply tools and methodology to \nscreen projects for climate risks and for mitigation potentials, (ii) develop and manage the \nclimate change database and knowledge base, and (iii) support incorporation of adaptation and \nmitigation options into project design. \n \n8.  Output 2: Capacity of DMCs in developing and/or implementing climate change \nstrategies  and  action  plans  strengthened.  A  highly  selective  and  transformation-driven \nclimate  change  capacity  building  program  targeting  relevant  government  executing  and \nimplementing  agencies  will  be  conducted  in  coordination  with  centers  of  excellence  and \ndevelopment partners. This program will cover: (i) strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity  to  access  and  absorb  climate  finance;  (ii)  providing  decision  support  tools  and \nguidelines,  including  those  on  monitoring,  verification  and  reporting,  adaptation  practices, \nmitigation measures, and risk assessment; (iii) building or strengthening DMCs\u2019 climate change \nstrategies and action plans; and (iv) training and awareness building on key emerging issues \nsuch adaptive governance, economically sound climate proofing and engineering measures, \ncarbon intensity reduction and carbon trading, disaster risk reduction and management, and \nnatural adaptation measures.10 The following key activities will be supported under this output: (i) \nassessing training needs and mapping capacity; (ii) developing a phased approach for capacity \ndevelopment  (e.g.,  targeting  two  or  three  countries  per  year);  (iii)  conducting  networking, \ndissemination, workshops, and training activities; and (iv) post-training evaluation and feedback \nto measure program effectiveness. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,325,000, of which $575,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $750,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by TASF-other sources. The governments of participating \nSouth Asia DMCs will  provide counterpart support in the form of office space and use of \nfacilities, counterpart staff, related administrative expenses, and other in-kind contributions. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB, through SARD, will be the executing agency responsible for the coordination, \nsupervision, and implementation of all TA activities. The Portfolio, Results, and Quality Control \nUnit within SARD will establish a TA coordination unit comprising core international and national \nstaff and consultants to oversee day-to-day TA implementation. The TA coordination unit will \nliaise with other relevant ADB units and/or offices, particularly the Bangladesh Resident Mission, \nIndia  Resident  Mission,  Nepal  Resident  Mission,  Sri  Lanka  Resident  Mission,  South  Asia \nRegional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division, and relevant divisions in ADB\u2019s \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department, Economics and Research Department, \nand Office of Cofinancing Operations. The implementation of the TA will be coordinated with \nconcerned  ministries  in  selected  South  Asia  DMCs  that  will  be  identified  during  TA \nimplementation and as guided by the respective governments. \n                                                \n10 The challenge will be to differentiate the actual versus the perceived needs of the DMCs. The actual needs will be \nidentified by extensive consultations with governments, development partners, and regional centers of excellence. \nSpecific  capacity building  activities  will be  designed  based  on  preliminary  assessment  of  needs  and gaps \nconducted during the onset of TA implementation. \n ", "4 \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented for 36 months tentatively from January 2014 to December \n2016. It will require approximately 36 person-months of international and 42 person-months of \nnational consulting services in the areas of climate change (i) risk assessment and screening, (ii) \nmitigation,  (iii)  institutional  capacity  development  and  training,  (iv)  database  and  portal \nmanagement, and (v) other sector specialists depending on the nature of projects in the pipeline. \nThe  outline terms  of  reference for  the  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Consultants  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis and/or through a firm. The institutional capacity development \nand training specialists will be recruited through a firm using quality- and cost-based selection \nwith  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10.  Consultant  selection  will  be  done  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will \nconform to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). All equipment will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as \namended from time to time) and turned over to ADB upon TA completion. \n \n12.  A review of the TA will be undertaken after the first 6 months of implementation to \nassess progress, revise outputs and activities as necessary, and request additional funding from \nADB and other development partners to implement additional TA activities. A full assessment \nwill be undertaken upon TA completion to report on the achievements and lessons learned in \nmainstreaming climate change in SARD operations. \n \nIV.
