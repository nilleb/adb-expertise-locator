INTRODUCTION \n1.  Established in 2005, the Ministry of Labor and Vocational Training (MLVT) is mandated \nby the Government of Cambodia to direct the technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET) and labor sectors to reduce poverty and promote inclusive growth.1 In the past 10 years, \nMLVT has improved access to formal technical and vocational training. In 2012\u20132013, more \nthan 8,700 students (23% female) were enrolled in formal training courses (certificate level and \nabove) compared to about 4,300 students (27.5% female) in 2008\u20132009. Despite this increase, \naccording  to  the  labor  force  survey  in  2012,  it  is  estimated  that  35.5%  of  the  employed \npopulation aged 15 or older (7,197,416) had a secondary education and 3.3% had attended \ntechnical and vocational education.2 A fact-finding mission conducted from 9 to 13 March 2015 \nby the Asian Development Bank (ADB) reconfirmed the importance of capacity development \ntechnical assistance (TA) for MLVT\u2019s Directorate General of Technical and Vocational Education \nand Training (DGTVET) to address major capacity and policy gaps.3 During the mission, the \ngovernment  emphasized  the  TA\u2019s  importance  in  providing  long-term  capacity  building  for \nDGTVET to develop and reform Cambodia\u2019s TVET sector. The mission discussed and agreed \nwith  the  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  scope,  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements,  costs,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.4   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n 2.  The government acknowledges that the current workforce\u2019s skills mismatch, shortage, \nand low education and skills pose major constraints to conducting business in Cambodia and \nlimit the country\u2019s competitiveness and growth. In response, it has taken steps to reform and \nexpand  the  country\u2019s  TVET  system.  The  government\u2019s  Rectangular  Strategy  for  Growth, \nEmployment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III; the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP, \n2014\u20132018);5and the Industrial Development Policy, 2015\u20132025 emphasize skills development \nfor higher technology skills training to grow the economy.6 \n \n3.  Since 2009, with ADB assistance, the government has been modernizing the TVET \nsystem. The Strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training Project7 (STVET \n2010\u20132015) has made significant achievements, including (i) preparation of the TVET Strategic \nPlan, 2014\u20132018, endorsed by DGTVET in April 2015;  (ii) development of the draft study report \non MLVT TVET Medium Term Expenditure Framework, 2015\u20132018, which is expected to be \nendorsed in quarter 3, 2015; (iii) introduction of TVET management information and labor \nmarket  information  systems;  (iv)  capacity-building  training  for  TVET  instructors  to  pilot  a \ncompetency-based training system; and (v) development of skills standards for priority sectors.8    \n                                                \n1 Sub-decree # 52 (2005) on Organization and Functioning of MLVT.  \n2 Government of Cambodia, National Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Planning, 2013, Cambodia Labor Force and \nChild Labor Survey 2012, (Phnom Penh). \n3 The concept paper for the proposed TA was approved on 6 February 2015. Major capacity and policy gaps are \nsummarized in paragraph 3 of the TA report. \n4 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 April 2015. \n5 Government of Cambodia. 2013.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Asian Development \nFund Grant to the Kingdom of Cambodia: Strengthening Technical Vocational Education and Training Project. \nManila. The project was approved in November 2009.  \n8 Priority sectors include: construction, auto mechanics, and information communication technology and business. \n ", "2 \n \nTo further support reforms, the TVET Sector Development Program (TVETSDP)9 supports (i) \ndeveloping and implementing policies that enable the TVET system to be more accessible and \nrelevant to labor market needs; (ii) increasing engagement of employers in TVET\u2014through the \nintroduction of apprenticeship, internship, and stipend programs for middle-level training\u2014and \nof  sector  skills  councils  and  centers  of  excellence;  and  (iii)  enhancing  capacity  of  TVET \ninstitutions to implement and monitor the Cambodian Qualification Framework.10 Despite the \nachievements, there is still intense pressure on DGTVET to develop and implement results-\nbased planning and budgeting for TVET programs. The TA will address several major capacity \nand policy gaps, including: \n \n (i)   A  lack  of understanding  of results-based  planning  and  budgeting that  exists \namong  staff  at  DGTVET  and  training  institutes.  This  capacity  gap  is  one \nimportant reason for low national budget allocation for the sector.11 The TA will \ndevelop capacity of MLVT\u2019s DGTVET to link key result indicators of the TVET \nStrategic  Plan,  2014-2018  with  budget  formulation,  implementation,  and \nmonitoring.  The  government\u2019s  public  financial  management  reform  (PFMR) \nprogram  underlines  the  importance  of  improving  financial  accountability  and \nbudget\u2013policy linkages toward performance accountability.12  \n(ii)  The limited capacity of DGTVET, which also serves as the secretariat of the \nNational Training Board (NTB)  in TVET policy formulation and implementation, \nhas also been a critical constraint in TVET reforms.13 The TA will build capacity of \nDGTVET and relevant agencies under NTB to develop a national TVET policy, \nwhich will guide skills development strategies and facilitate coordination amongst \nstakeholders.         \n(iii)  Employer collaboration in TVET policy and program development is at an initial \nstage, and focuses mainly on developing skills standards and learning materials. \nThe government views public\u2013private sector partnerships as imperative to skills \ndevelopment\u2014driven by the government\u2019s need to leverage additional financing \nand expertise from the private sector. To facilitate systematic dialogue with, and \npromote engagement of, the private sector in TVET development and service \ndelivery,  the  TA  will  assist  DGTVET  to  conduct  a  feasibility  study  exploring \ndifferent training fund options. \n(iv)  Women\u2019s enrollment in formal training programs, compared with the female labor \nforce participation rate of 62.0%, has decreased from 27.5% in 2008\u20132009 to \n23.0%  in  2012\u20132013.  To  expand  women\u2019s  opportunities  and  promote  their \naccess  to  the full  range  of  occupational  choices,  especially  in  nontraditional \ncourses and TVET management positions, the TA will build DGTVET\u2019s capacity \nto develop and implement a DGTVET gender-responsive policy and action plan.  \n  \n                                                \n9 ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Technical Vocational Education and Training Sector Development Program. Manila. The \nprogram was approved in September 2014. \n10 A sub-decree was issued by the government on 28 March 2014 to promulgate the implementation of the \nCambodian Qualification Framework, which has eight qualification levels. \n11 The national recurrent budget allocated to MLVT has been low and fluctuated from $25 million in 2013 to $22 \nmillion in 2014, and to an estimated $29 million or 1.3% of total government recurrent expenditure in 2015. \nDGTVET budget for 2015 is estimated at $9.2 million. \n12 The PFRM program is the 21-year program framework (2004\u20132025). MLVT is one of 10 ministries piloted on \nprogram budgeting. \n13 NTB is the apex body for TVET policy formulation. NTB is chaired by a deputy prime minister. \n ", "3 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n4.   TA is aligned with the findings and recommendations of ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020 that, among others, aims to assist developing member countries under rapid \neconomic  and  social  changes  in  increasing  investment  in  education,  which  is  essential  in \ntackling widening inequalities, expanding the human capital base for higher productivity, and \nensuring  inclusive  economic  growth.14 The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Cambodia  country \npartnership  strategy,  2014\u20132018,  which  emphasizes  the  importance  of  human  and  social \ndevelopment through improved quality of education and training systems that are linked closely \nwith labor market demands and development needs. The country partnership strategy also aims \nto support the government in public sector management, including improving budget preparation \nand execution, accounting, and financial management.    \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact of the TA is aligned with the government\u2019s NSDP objective for development \nof high quality and capable human resource to support economic growth and competitiveness of \nCambodia.  \n \n6.  The outcome of the TA will be improved capacity of DGTVET technical departments and \ntechnical  training  institutes  (TTIs)  to  develop  and  implement  results-based  planning  and \nbudgeting, and TVET policies.15 By 2018, it is expected that (i) six technical departments and 24 \nTTIs of DGTVET will implement results-based planning and budgeting and (ii) TVET recurrent \nspending will increase from about $9.2 million in 2015 to about $12.2 million.     \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA seeks to provide long-term capacity development of DGTVET for national skills \ndevelopment, and will have three outputs:  \n \n8.  Output 1: Strengthened results-based planning and budgeting for technical and \nvocational education and training. The TA aims to equip officials responsible for planning and \nbudgeting  from  the  six  technical  departments  and  24  TTIs  under  DGTVET  and  MLVT \nDepartment of Finance with the necessary knowledge and skills in results-based planning and \nbudgeting through a phased training program. Activities will include (i) a review of DGTVET\u2019s \nbudgeting and planning process; (ii) an assessment of staff knowledge of results-based TVET \nplanning and budgeting, including examining their capacity-building needs; (iii) the development \nof training materials and tools, and a program for capacity-building workshops, including on-the-\njob training; and (iv) an impact assessment on capacity building for technical departments and \nTTIs. Guidelines issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance and MLVT, as well as training \nmaterials and tools to be designed by the TA consultant, will be followed and used. TVET and \nlabor market information systems, as well as the draft MLVT TVET medium-term expenditure \nframework,  developed under the  STVET  project,  will  be  important  inputs for results-based \nplanning and budgeting.  \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n15 TTIs, in this project paper, include polytechnic institutes and regional and provincial training centers. They are line \ninstitutions of MLVT.  \n \n \n \n ", "4 \n \n9.  Output  2:  Strengthened  capacity  of  the  DGTVET  for  development  of  national \ntechnical vocational education and training policy and completion of a feasibility study \non training funds. Through training programs, the TA will enhance the capacity of DGTVET \nstaff, especially those in policy and strategy departments, and members of an interagency \nworking group (IWG). Activities will include (i) establishing an IWG to review relevant national \npolicies and draw on experience from other countries in drafting national TVET policy; (ii) \ndeveloping  time-bound  capacity-building  and  consultation  workshop  programs,  including \nspecific inputs from each IWG member; and (iii) drafting a national TVET policy to be endorsed \nby  the  government. 16  In  addition,  the  TA  consultant  and  assigned  staff  from  relevant \ndepartments  will  conduct  a  feasibility  study  on  training  funds.  The  findings  will  help  the \ngovernment, especially MLVT, in preparing a skills development fund system. \n \n10.  Output  3:  Strengthened  capacity  of  the  DGTVET  for  development  and \nimplementation of DGTVET gender policy and action plan. The TA will increase women\u2019s \naccess to certificate-level training programs and participation in TVET system management \npositions. Under this output, MLVT will develop a DGTVET gender policy and action plan. \nActivities include (i) assessing capacity building needs of staff from gender secretariat, gender \noffice, technical departments, and selected TTIs; (ii) developing training materials and program \nconsultation workshops; (iii) drafting DGTVET gender policy and action plan to be endorsed by \nMLVT; and (iv) developing terms of reference for social equity staff position of DGTVET\u2019s \ngender office. Gender focal persons and staff from MLVT\u2019s gender secretariat and gender office, \nas  well  as  from  six  technical  departments  and  24  TTIs,  will  organize  and  participate  in \nconsultation workshops to develop and implement DGTVET\u2019s gender policy and action plan.  \n \n11.  The TA has several innovative features. Development of a national TVET policy through \nIWG under NTB will increase government ownership and private sector engagement during \nimplementation.  The  TVET  policy  and  feasibility  study  on  training  funds  will  be  important \nknowledge products for implementing the Industrial Policy Development, 2015\u20132025, and for \nexploring public\u2013private partnerships in Cambodia\u2019s education and training sector.            \n \n12.  The  TA  design  assumes  that  (i)  the  government  continues  to  prioritize  skills \ndevelopment and commits to increase the budget allocation for TVET, (ii) the PFMR program \ncontinues  to  be  implemented  and  results-based  planning  and  budgeting  continues  to  be \npromoted, (iii) DGTVET operations comply with requirements of the government-led PFMR \nprogram and MEF\u2019s annual budget preparation, and (iv) gender-inclusive skills development \ncontinues to be a priority for national skills development. The only critical risk is staff capacity \ncontinues to be weak in coordinating policy and budget discussions and applying knowledge. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart staff, office space, furniture, equipment for minor printing or photocopying, \nlogistical and administrative assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n16 The IWG will comprise at least 20 members from NTB. Representatives from the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, \nMLVT\u2019s gender secretariat, and DGTVET\u2019s gender office will also be IWG members. The TVET national policy is \none of five policy actions under TVETSDP. \n \n ", "5 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2017. MLVT \nwill be the TA executing agency and MLVT\u2019s DGTVET will be the implementing agency. The \nproject  steering  committee  for  TVETSDP  will  oversee  TA  implementation.  The  project \ncoordination unit, once established and with TVETSDP staff assigned, will be tasked to (i) \nensure TA outcomes and outputs are achieved within the agreed schedule and budget, (ii) work \nwith consultants in carrying out TA activities, and (iii) coordinate with other stakeholders.  \n \n15.  TA implementation will be supported by about 54 person-months of consulting services \n(32 person-months of international and 22 person-months of national consulting services). ADB \nwill engage the consultants on an individual basis following the Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time).17 The required qualifications and outline \nterms of reference for consultants are provided in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The implementing agency will manage expenses related to workshops, local trainings \nand seminars, and administrative support. The Implementing Agency will open a bank account \nendorsed  by  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance for  advance  payment facility for  small \nexpenditures on workshops, local trainings and seminars.18 The implementing agency will be \nresponsible to (i) submit the estimated costs of expenditures for the first 6 months for ADB\u2019s \nprior approval, and (ii) submit the required supporting documents for liquidation of eligible \nexpenditures  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). The implementing agency will submit quarterly progress reports \nand a TA completion report within 3 months of completion to ADB. Progress will be monitored \nagainst the intended outcome and outputs in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).   \n \n17.  The ADB mission, in coordination with the executing and implementing agencies, will \nmonitor  TA  implementation  through  periodic  missions.  Other  sources  that  will  support \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  include  workshop  reports  and  NTB\u2019s  and/or  project  steering \ncommittee\u2019s meeting minutes; training materials; policy, planning, and budgeting documents; \nand consultants\u2019 study reports. The implementing agency will disseminate lessons and good \npractices, training materials and assessment tools, and study and impact assessment reports \nproduced under the TA to relevant stakeholders and institutions through workshops and/or \nseminars and the NTB\u2019s and/or executing agency\u2019s websites.  \n    \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Cambodia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Strengthening Capacity Development for National Skills Development, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n17 Based on the experience of the Cambodia Resident Mission, it is extremely difficult to ensure firms deploy qualified \nindividual consultants, especially when a TA such as this depends on specialist expertise and skills that will \nfacilitate long-term capacity development. To reduce administrative burden and improve efficiency and value for \nmoney, ADB will engage all TA consulting services on output-based (lump-sum) contracts. The project coordination \nunit will work with the TA consultants in coordinating and carrying out activities with technical support from the \ninternational TVET specialist and team leader. ADB will develop reporting requirements (content and schedule) \nand payment milestones of each TA consultant before recruitment.      \n18 Direct payment through bank transfer to end-user and/or service provider will be made for large expenditures such \nas large consultation workshops and consulting services.   \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nThe impact of the TA is aligned with the government\u2019s NSDP objective for development of high quality and \ncapable human resource to support economic growth and competitiveness of Cambodia. \nProject  Result  Performance Indicators with Targets  Data Sources and \nChain  and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \n \nOutcome   By 2018:    Risk \nImproved capacity  Six technical departments and 24  TA completion  Staff capacity continues \nof DGTVET  TTIs of DGTVET implemented  report  to be weak in applying \ntechnical  results-based planning and    knowledge. \ndepartments and  budgeting (baseline will be   \nTTIs to develop  determined in Q3 2015)   \nand implement     \nresults-based  TVET recurrent spending increased  Budget Law 2017 \nplanning and  from about $9.2 million in 2015 to   \nbudgeting, and  about $12.2 million \nTVET policies   \n \nOutputs  By end of project year (2017)     \n \n92 officials (20% women) (18  Training proceeding  Insufficient number of \n1.
