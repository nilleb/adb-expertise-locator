The CoR has engaged the state design institute Kostanay Dorproject to carry out the \ndetailed engineering design which will be completed in Q4, 2015. It is also recruiting a local \nconsultant to prepare the feasibility study in conformance to government requirements. Given \nthe difference between ADB and Government in terms of required scope and depth of analysis \nfor  project  investment,  additional  due  diligence  is  necessary  for  ADB  financing.  In  this \nconnection,  a  PPTA  is  recommended  and  the  PPTA  consultants  will  work  closely  and \nconcurrently with CoR consultants to improve the feasibility study and detailed design, hence \nproducing mutually agreed design and implementation arrangements suitable for ADB financing. \nThe government was advised that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project.   \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The major activities and outputs are summarized in Table A3.1.  \n \nTable A3.1: Summary of Major Activities and Outputs \nExpected \nMajor Activities  Major Outputs \nCompletion  \nDue diligence on  \uf0b7  Sector assessment and results framework; design  Month 2-6 \nengineering, environment,  review report, IEE report; Resettlement Plan    \nresettlement, social,  \uf0b7  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy    \npoverty and gender   \n\uf0b7  Economic and financial analysis;  Procurement \nDue diligence on economic  Month 4-6 \ncapacity and financial management assessment; \nand financial analysis and   \nRisk assessment and management plan \ngovernance assessment   \n \nSector review and \n\uf0b7  Identification of specific areas where support is  Month 2-5 \nidentification of aspects for \nrequired for institutional development.    \ninstitutional strengthening \n \nProject implementation  \uf0b7  Project procurement plan; assistance to CoR in the  Month 7-15 \npreparation  procurement of civil works and recruitment of \nproject implementation consultants (technical and \nfinancial evaluation, contract finalization, and \nmobilization). \nIEE = initial environmental examination, IP = indigenous peoples, RP = resettlement plan. \n \nC.  Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n3.  The total cost of the TA amounts to $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The Government \nthrough CoR will provide counterpart support in the form of PIU staff, office space and supplies, \nsecretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government contribution \nis estimated to account for 11% of the total TA cost. The detailed cost estimate is in Table A3.2.  \n \nTable A3.2: Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \nItem    Cost ($'000) \nAsian Development Bank Financing a   \n1.      Consultants   \n  a.

The required positions and person-months are indicated in Table A3.3. The PPTA will \nrequire 12 person-months (PMs) international specialists and 13 PMs of national experts to be \nrecruited individually. For project due diligence where feasibility study is under preparation by \nEA following government internal requirements, hiring individual consultants with short duration \nis more appropriate for quick mobilization of consulting service and cost-effective than firms to \nperform the assignment. The individual experts will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).  \n \nTable A3.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \nInternational  National \nConsultants \n(PMs)  (PMs) \nHighway Specialist cum Procurement Expert  5   \nTransport Economist  3   \nFinancial Specialist  1   \nEnvironmental Specialist  1.5  2 \nResettlement Specialist  1.5   \nSocial Development Specialist    3 \nHighway Engineer cum Coordinator    8 \nTotal  12  13 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n5.
