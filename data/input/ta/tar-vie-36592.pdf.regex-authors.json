The need for developing a methodology to include poverty reduction impact as a factor \nin the prioritization and design of road investments was identified during a reconnaissance \nmission1 for the preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the Central Region Transport Network \nProject.  In  response  to  preliminary  discussions  with  the  Government  of  Viet  Nam  (the \nGovernment), a concept paper was developed and submitted for consideration for funding from \nthe Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. Following concept clearance the Fact-Finding Mission \nwas fielded in September 2002 to further define the scope of the TA. An understanding was \nreached  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope,  costs,  terms  of  reference,  and \nimplementation arrangements for the TA.2 This TA paper is based on the agreements reached \nwith the Government and the Mission\u2019s observations in the field. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.    Viet Nam\u2019s impressive economic growth during the 1990s has been strongly pro-poor. \nWith only marginal increases in inequality, the proportion of people living below the total poverty \nline has dropped from 58% in 1993 to 37% in 1998 and is estimated at about 32% in 2000. The \nproportion living below the food poverty line also declined from 25% to 15%, and was estimated \nat 13% in 2000, indicating that even the poorest segments of the population have benefited from \neconomic growth. However, the poverty incidence in Viet Nam is still high and remains as a \nrural phenomenon with 45% of the rural population living in poverty. Improvements in poverty \nremain fragile and vulnerable to external adverse impacts as many of the poor in 1993 now \nreside just above the poverty line and risk becoming poor again.  \n \n3.    To support the Government in pursuing balanced economic growth, the country strategy \nand program update 2003\u20132005 for Viet Nam and the poverty partnership agreement between \nViet  Nam  and  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  emphasizes  regional  development  through \ngeographical focus on the central region. The central region comprises provinces with relatively \nhigh poverty incidences, two of which are among the poorest in the country. Nearly all provinces \nhave strikingly high rural incidences of poverty. Geographical remoteness and disconnection \nfrom the rest of the economy are among the key factors for explaining poverty.  \n  \n4.  During processing for the TA to prepare for the Central Region Transport Network \nProject,  the  mission  identified  means  for  strengthening  poverty  reduction  objectives  in  the \nprioritization  and  design  of  transport  interventions  aimed  primarily  at  promoting  economic \nintegration and growth. Two of the major factors perceived to influence the ability of the poor to \nbenefit from traditional economic growth interventions in transport include the extent to which \nnational and provincial roads link into the local network of poorer communities with economic \npotential and the availability and competition of transport services.3   \n \n5.  Prioritization of investments in road links below the national road network is made at the \ndecentralized provincial government level. While this ensures that local knowledge of perceived \nbenefits are captured in prioritization, networks across provincial, district, and rural access roads \nappear to be determined in isolation from each other. Discussions with province governments \n                                                 \n1 28 June to 12 July 2002. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on October 2002. \n3 The term \u201ctransport services\u201d refers to modes and means of transportation of people and goods, including traders \nand other middlemen. ", "2   \nindicate  that  provincial  roads  are  prioritized  primarily  on  the  basis  of  population  size  and \nphysical condition of the roads. While these criteria are likely to reflect economic growth criteria, \nthere is little consideration for integration with lower networks and for the ability of the poor to \nbenefit.  \n \n6.  Prioritization of rural access roads appears to be disconnected from the prioritization of \nhigher networks with little concern for access beyond the rural community level. To design and \nprioritize road investments to maximize the poverty reduction impact, a number of factors need \nto be considered jointly with national and local priorities. Investment priorities for individual \nroads need to be seen from a network perspective, where national and provincial roads are \nlinked into local community network. Conversely, targeted rural access road improvements need \nto be linked into a larger network to enable wider accessibility for the poor. Current work is being \nundertaken by the Rural Transport Project 2 (RT2), funded jointly by the World Bank and \nDepartment for International Development. The work will prioritize rural access roads on the \nbasis of poverty reduction. However, rural community networks must not be developed in \nisolation from a larger network perspective.   \n \n7.  Poverty mapping work done under the RT2 on the provincial level indicates that different \nhead count approaches for geographical poverty targeting of investments may result in different \nconclusions for prioritization. The causes of poverty may also vary significantly between and \nwithin  provinces.  There  is  a  need  to  develop  methodologies  for  selection  of  transport \ninterventions so that priorities are not made in isolation from causes of poverty and the potential \nfor economic growth.  \n \n8.  While transport interventions can lift major barriers for the poor to access economic and \nsocial services in geographically remote and economically isolated areas, accessibility is also \ndetermined by the demand and availability of transport means. The extent to which vehicle \noperating cost (VOC) savings from road improvements translate into benefits to the poor will \nlargely  be  determined  by  the  outreach  and  competition  of  transport  services  and  by  the \ncompetition  among  traders  and  other  middlemen.  Road  improvements  can,  through  VOC \nsavings, lead to improvements in the availability of transport services, in previously deprived \nareas. However, these potential impacts are largely under-researched, and little is known about \nthe supply side effects of road improvements on transport services.    \n \n9.  Similarly, little is known about the poor\u2019s demand for transport services, affordability, and \nthe cost structure of services. An assessment of the poverty reduction impact of road networks \nto ensure that VOC savings translate into benefits to the poor will evidently need to include a \nstudy of transport services directly used by the poor and/or of means of transport used to bring \nproduce  to  the  markets.  The  mission  has  been  informed  that  no  such  study  has  been \nundertaken for Viet Nam, and the Government has identified a great need to undertake a study \nfor developing a methodology to assess the poverty reduction impacts to enhance a cost \nefficient prioritization of road investment funds. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The overall objective of the TA is to examine ways to improve mobility for the rural poor \nin  Viet  Nam.  The  TA  will  develop  a  methodology  for  prioritizing  and  designing  transport \ninvestments  from  a  network  perspective  to  ensure  that  the  poor  can  benefit  from  road \ninvestments. The methodology will be tested on projects financed by domestic and overseas ", "    3 \ndevelopment assistance. The purpose is to help improve the design both of traditional economic \ngrowth projects and of projects intended to directly target the poor in the transport sector. This \nwill help strengthen the capacity of provincial governments to (i) improve the resource allocation \nof public investment funds; and (ii) prepare subproject investments in roads, combining bottom-\nup priorities for poverty reduction with top-down priorities for economic integration and growth. \nThe TA will also provide information for the assessment of the poverty impact of the Central \nRegion  Transport  Network  Project  and  establish  the  indicators  for  monitoring  impacts  of \ntransport projects. Specifically, the TA will (i) develop a methodology for defining subprojects \nfrom network perspectives; (ii) develop poverty impact indicators for determining the impacts of \nroad investments; (iii) conduct a poverty impact mapping exercise for road infrastructure; and \n(iv) examine outreach, competition, affordability, and the cost structure of transport services for \nthe poor. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \n11.  The methodology developed will be tested on two provinces in the central region to be \nselected under the TA. The provinces will be selected in consultation with the Ministry of \nTransport  (MOT),  Project  Management  Unit  1  (PMU-1),  and  provincial  governments,  and \nmutually agreed upon between the Government and ADB.  The selection will consider transport \ninterventions supported by ADB and external agencies providing funding to the central region.4  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  consists  of  two  main  components.  Component  1  comprises  developing  a \nmethodology for designing and selecting network subprojects for integrating poverty reduction \nimpacts with economic growth priorities. Component 2 includes the study of transport services \nfor the poor to examine the conditions under which the poor can benefit directly from road \nnetwork  improvements.  The  consultants  will  review  socioeconomic  and  census  data,  and \npoverty data collected under RT2. Based on a review the consultants will determine additional \ndata required to meet the needs of both components. Additional data will be collected in a single \nsurvey.   \n \n13.  The methodology will be designed to maximize the use and benefits of qualitative and \nquantitative  survey  tools,  combining  conventional  socioeconomic  household  and  time  use \nsurvey techniques, freight and passenger surveys, and VOC savings data with key informant \ninterviews and participatory assessments, to develop poverty impact indicators. Combined data \nmethodologies will provide in-depth analysis of data, ensure effective crosschecking of results \nand robustness of the study.  \n \n14.  Two provinces will be selected to serve as pilot cases for the study. The provinces will \nbe selected based on differences in geographical, socioeconomic, and poverty characteristics \nand transport intensity. The selection will include consideration of provinces under the Central \nRegion  Transport  Network  Project.  From  the  survey,  component  1  will  develop  a  set  of \nindicators, reflecting poverty impacts of roads, for the poverty impact mapping exercise. Road \ncondition data collected under RT2 and the TA for the Central Region Transport Network \nProject, and provincial knowledge of local road conditions will be combined with poverty impact \nmapping for the two pilot provinces to test the methodology developed under this component.  \nComponent 1 will also review and assess the institutional decision making process for road \ninvestment priorities on the national and provincial levels. \n \n                                                 \n4  Including the Third Road Improvement Project approved by ADB in 1999 and RT2 funded by the World Bank and \nDepartment for International Development. ", "4   \n15.   Component 2 will review the regulations, vehicle registration and licensing practices, \nand other policies for transport services to assess implications for competition and access to \nfreight and passenger transport services in the two pilot provinces. The review will pay particular \nattention to the barriers, including physical constraints, for providing transport services and will \ninvestigate how barriers can be lifted for access-deprived segments of the population. The \nassessment  will  take  into  account  road  conditions,  infrastructure  facilities  for  transport, \npopulation density, and economic potential. The consultants will analyze the impacts of road \nconditions  on  vehicle  cost  structures,  ownership,  demand,  affordability,  availability,  and \nconsumer  satisfaction  for  transport  services  across  consumer  groups.  The  study  will \ndisaggregate for socioeconomic groups, including gender and ethnic minorities.    \n \n16.   A number of workshops will be held at the provincial and national levels to disseminate \nprogress  and  findings  from  the  study.  The  consultants  will  work  closely  with  the  selected \nprovincial governments to ensure that the methodology considers provincial development plans \nand poverty reduction objectives. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $437,500 equivalent, consisting of $219,000 in \nforeign exchange and $218,500 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $350,000, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $131,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund and administered by ADB. The Government will bear the balance of local \ncurrency  costs,  amounting  to  $87,500  equivalent,  through  the  provision  of  office  facilities, \nadministrative support, and remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff and their local \ntransport.  Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOT will be the Executing Agency for the TA and PMU-1 will be the Implementing \nAgency.  PMU-1  will  be  responsible  for  arranging  suitable  office  accommodation  for  the \nconsultants, facilitating coordination with the Transport Development and Strategy Institute and \nprovincial  government  departments.  PMU-1  will  also  assist  in  the  arrangements  for \ndissemination workshops.  Fieldwork and provision of maps will be facilitated through the PMU-\n1\u2019s central regional office and provincial departments of transport. PMU-1 will nominate suitable \ncounterpart staff to coordinate and guide activities between this TA and other relevant projects \nand activities. Other suitable counterpart staff will be provided by PMU-1 and selected province \ngovernments.  The consultants will work closely with the counterpart staff, who will be part of the \nTA  team,  and  ensure  that  the  MOT,  PMU-1  and  selected  province  governments  are  fully \ninvolved in all activities of the TA. PMU-1 will facilitate coordination of consultants\u2019 work with \nactivities undertaken under the Central Region Transport Network TA. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented during 12 months, with activities expected to commence in \nMarch 2003 and be completed by February 2004. The TA will require a total of 17 person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services:  9  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  on  an \nintermittent basis and 8 person-months of domestic consulting services. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The international consultants will include one transport specialist, with experience \nin  transport  services,  intermediate  means  of  transport,  and  regulations  and  licensing \nprocedures; and one socioeconomist, with experience in survey methodologies, participatory ", "    5 \napproaches  and  poverty  assessments.  The  domestic  consultant,  with  experience  from  the \ntransport sector in Viet Nam, will facilitate communication with local and central government \nauthorities, and review transport regulations and policies.  Outline terms of reference, including \nreporting requirements, are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will be monitored and reviewed by ADB TA missions; regular communications \nwith PMU-1; and the interim, completion, and workshop reports of the international consultants. \nComponents 1 and 2 will have individual reports. The transport specialist will be the team leader \nand  will  be  responsible  for  submission  of  reports  and  for  coordinating  consultancy  and \ncounterpart staff inputs.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, for the \nTransport Services Networks for the Poor, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
