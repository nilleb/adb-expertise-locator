THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach, (ii) a proposed policy-based loan for subprogram 1, and (iii) proposed \nproject loans, all to Papua New Guinea (PNG) for the Health Services Sector Development \nProgram (SDP). \n \n2.  The SDP combines a policy-based operation and a project investment to support critical \nwhole-of-government and sector reforms with health sector investments. The policy-based loan \nwill support fiscal policy, public financial management (PFM), and health sector reforms while \nsafeguarding funding for basic services during a period of fiscal tightening. The project loans fill \ninvestment gaps to support PNG\u2019s progress toward universal health coverage.1  \n \nII.  THE SECTOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Despite a period of high economic growth, averaging 6% annually from 2006 to 2015, \nPNG is in the bottom quartile globally for life expectancy at 65 years and failed to achieve the \nMillennium Development Goals for maternal and child health.2 The estimated burden of disease \nis  dominated  by  chronic  diseases,  including  strokes  and  heart  disease,  but  also  includes \nconditions of poverty such as pneumonia and neonatal conditions.3 Weak information systems \nresult in uncertainty about the leading causes of ill health, which hampers effective priority setting. \nPNG\u2019s poor health outcomes are a result of deteriorating health care services caused by a \ncombination of volatile and unpredictable health financing as well as systemic weaknesses in \nregulatory frameworks, government systems, and national and health sector capacities.4  \n \n4.  A sharp slowdown in economic growth in 2016 weakened global commodity prices, on \nwhich  the  PNG\u2019s  economy  is  highly  dependent,  and  underperforming  domestic  resource \nmobilization led to low budget execution rates, i.e., actual health expenditures were 32% lower \nthan budgeted. Overall, health spending accounted for only 10% of total public expenditure and \nremained  37%  below  the  spending  peak  of  2014,  when  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in \nexpectation of growing resource revenues had led to significantly increased health financing, \nincluding the introduction of free primary health care.5 The economic slowdown constrained \ninvestments in new health infrastructure and reduced the quality of existing service delivery. \n \n5.  Deficiencies in health sector governance, including an inconsistent legal framework and \nfragmented funds flows, undermine service delivery and blur the accountabilities of the various \nstakeholders. Weak PFM, both nationally and in the health sector, further erodes health services. \nA  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  (PEFA)  assessment  in  2015  highlighted \nweaknesses across the PFM cycle, with major issues in financial controls, accounting, reporting \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

Port Moresby. \n ", "2 \nand  procurement,  among  others.6 In  the  health  sector,  systemic  weaknesses,  including  in \noversight  and  performance  management,  and  limited  staff  capacity  in  management  and \nadministration reduce the effective and efficient use of scarce resources. \n \n6.  The government is committed to the health sector and has identified health as one of the \nfive key areas under the Alotau Accord II, which sets out the government\u2019s priorities up to 2022.7 \nHealth deliverables under the Alotau Accord II include (i) expansion of health infrastructure, (ii) \nimproved  medical  procurement,  and  (iii)  strengthened  monitoring  systems.  Strategies  for \nachieving universal health coverage are reflected in the National Health Plan (NHP) 2011\u20132020, \nand policies and standards to support these have been developed.8 Dentralized service delivery \nis supported through the establishment and strengthening of provincial health authorities (PHAs), \na key reform to align rural health and hospital services. More broadly, at the national level the \ngovernment is implementing measures to strengthen policy development and PFM as part of their \nPEFA Road Map, 2015\u20122018.9 \n \n7.  The SDP is aligned with the country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), which identifies both the health sector and public sector management \nas focus areas for investment.10 It builds upon ADB\u2019s long-term engagement in PNG in these \nsectors,  and  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  health  operations  plan.11 The  SDP  will  support  the \nimplementation  of  PNG\u2019s  Development  Strategic  Plan,  2010\u20132030  and  the  Medium  Term \nDevelopment Plan II, 2016\u20132017, thereby benefiting all sectors.12 The medium-term plan links the \nnational budget to the government\u2019s priorities and identifies key reform areas, including (i) PFM \nand the development of a medium-term fiscal strategy, (ii) subnational service delivery, (iii) \ninnovative procurement strategies, and (iv) governance of the national budget process to improve \nallocative efficiency. The SDP will also support key priority areas of the NHP 2011\u20122020, including \nimproving service delivery, and strengthening partnerships and health systems. \n \n8.  The SDP modality maximizes ADB\u2019s value addition by (i) combining critical reforms to \nremove bottlenecks in the health service delivery chain and ensuring that resources are available, \nallocated, and used more sustainably and efficiently through a programmatic approach with three \nsubprograms over 2018\u20122020, each financed by a policy-based loan, with (ii) project financing to \n                                                \n6  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2015.

ADB has been working closely with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, \nand  the  Government  of  Australia  to  support  the  PNG  government  in  strengthening  its \nmacroeconomic policy and PFM. The support by the IMF and the World Bank for domestic \nresource  mobilization  and  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  advice  complements  ADB\u2019s  support. \nAustralia provides support for expenditure and revenue reforms. The PFM working group and the \nquarterly meetings of the health development partners facilitate coordination, while the SDP\u2019s \npolicy reform matrix adds value by helping prioritize and align assistance in fiscal policy, PFM, \nand health sector reform across development partners.14 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the SDP will be affordable, accessible, equitable, and high-quality health \nservices for all citizens developed, in alignment with the vision of the NHP 2011\u20122020. The \noutcome will be a more sustainable and efficient health care system achieved.15 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  The SDP will have three outputs, each of which will be achieved through an interconnected \npolicy-based program and project investment supporting reform and investment from the national \nlevel through to the provincial and district levels. The scope of each is summarized below. The \npolicy matrix is in Appendix 4. All 15 reform actions under subprogram 1 have been completed. \n \n12.  Output 1: National frameworks and PFM enhanced. Output 1 will support the long-term \nsustainability and effective use of health sector financing. Under subprogram 1, the policy actions \naddress weaknesses identified in the PEFA assessment and will (i) ensure adequate domestic \nhealth financing within a sustainable overall resource envelope by approving the Medium Term \nFiscal Strategy; (ii) approve an amendment to the Public Finances (Management) Act to expand \ncoverage to statutory authorities such as PHAs; (iii) initiate procurement reforms; (iv) implement \nthe integrated financial management system as the sole system for budgeting, accounting, and \nfinancial reporting  of  all  public funds  in  43  national  government  entities  and five  statutory \nauthorities; and (v) prepare a health system governance discussion paper on the overarching \nregulatory frameworks for the health sector with recommendations for law reform.16 Under \nsubprograms 2 and 3, the government will continue to promote fiscal responsibility and safeguard \nhealth sector funding within the medium-term fiscal strategy and the national budget, implement \nbudget  reforms  to  improve  fund  flow  monitoring,  support  the  implementation  of  a  new \nprocurement act, and prepare a consolidated health services and administration law. \n \n                                                \n13  The project will finance phase 2 of the Rural Health Project (footnote 11). \n14  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents under Appendix 2). The World Bank is \nprocessing a development policy operation for late 2018 consideration by the ADB Board of Directors with a likely \nfocus on revenue generation and PFM reform. \n15  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16  Links between Public Financial Management Reform Priorities and the Sector Development Program (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents under Appendix 2). \n ", "4 \n13.  The project will support the government with the preparation of (i) health service delivery \ncost estimates, to safeguard adequate public resources for the health sector; and (ii) the next \nNHP (2021\u20132030), which will continue the systematic strengthening of the health sector. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Subnational  health  system  management  strengthened.  Output  2  will \nsupport  decentralized  health  service  delivery  by  focusing  on  capacity  building  of  staff  in \nmanagement, PFM, and reporting; and contribute to the better alignment of functions, resources, \nand accountability.17 Subprogram 1 policy actions will support the further rollout of the PHA model \nin one province and the direct transfer of consolidated health funding to PHAs. Subprograms 2 \nand 3 will (i) continue the rollout of PHAs, (ii) standardize and guide the management and \nresponsibility of PHAs, and (iii) continue to support the direct and timely flow of finance from the \nnational level to PHAs. Strengthened PHA capacity will enable better budgeting and stronger \nmonitoring through midyear budget execution reports, in full compliance with PFM frameworks. \n \n15.  The project will support the implementation of the integrated public health model that links \ncommunity health posts, health centers, and district hospitals; and provide consulting services to \ncapacity build PHAs through the development of the PHA operations manual, to standardize \nservice delivery, and a suite of development programs. These programs, including leadership and \nmanagement courses, will target all PHA board members, executive district and middle managers, \nclinical staff, and corporate service analysts to raise their skills and improve the systems and \nprocesses of (i) corporate and clinical governance; (ii) leadership and management, including \nPFM; and (iii) effective use of integrated data in decision making, for better service delivery. PHAs\u2019 \nfinancial management systems will be strengthened, with an intention to integrate them into the \nnational integrated financial management system. As a result, PHAs will be able to develop \nimproved provincial and district health information profiles, corporate plans and comprehensive \nbudgets,  financial  statements,  and  annual  management  and  performance  reports.  A  PHA \nmonitoring framework will be supported at the Department of Health (DOH). \n \n16.  Output 3: Health service delivery components strengthened. Output 3 supports the \neffective delivery of quality health services by investing in NHP priorities for rehabilitating rural \nhealth care infrastructure, improving the availability of medical supplies, building capacity for \nclinical governance, supporting new health partnerships, and strengthening information systems \nthrough digitalization. Subprogram 1 policy actions will (i) refine the medical catalogue to facilitate \nprocurement and inventory management, (ii) institutionalize the mSupply18 tender management \nmodule, and (iii) update the database of active health partnerships. Subprograms 2 and 3 will \ncontinue to reform medical supplies and increasing the use of information systems to increase \naccountability and ultimately improve health service delivery. \n \n17.  The project reinforces policy actions by (i) strengthening the procurement and distribution \nof medicines providing benefits to the most remote parts of the country; (ii) developing health \nsector partnerships across PHAs, district development authorities, churches, and the private \nsector to ensure a comprehensive service delivery framework; (iii) rolling out the digital health \ninformation system nationally and using its data for decision making; and (iv) upgrading health \nfacilities, which reflects the bulk of the project investment, including at least two district hospitals \nand six health centers in accordance with the National Health Service Standards, which will \nbenefit more than 250,000 people living in these remote areas. Project activities to complement \ncivil works will include (i) engaging with local communities and provincial and district authorities \nto support effective and sustainable transformational change in health awareness and health-\n                                                \n17  Financing the Front Line (accessible from the list of linked documents under Appendix 2). \n18  mSupply is a digital logistics system implemented in PNG with the support of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, \nTuberculosis and Malaria. \n ", "5 \nseeking behaviors (e.g., immunization); (ii) training of maternal health workers in project facilities \non essential obstetric care, integrated management of childhood illness, and safe birthing; and (ii) \nother priority clinical upskilling. The project will also support health facility management and \nmaintenance training, and periodic assessment of project facilities to ensure that they continue to \nmeet National Health Service Standards. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs, and Investment and Financing Plans \n \n18.  The program considers the government\u2019s financing needs, the availability of alternative \nfinancing, including the estimated financial support from other development partners, and debt \nsustainability.19 The IMF estimates that the government\u2019s net borrowing requirements between \n2018 and 2020 amount to about $2.4 billion. The government has requested $300 million in \nfinancial assistance in the form of a programmatic approach, comprising three loans from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources of $100 million each for subprograms 1, 2, and 3, to help finance the \nprogram. The remaining gap will be filled  mostly through  concessional foreign borrowings, \nincluding budget support operations and project loans in the pipeline from other development \npartners. The policy-based loan will provide budget financing that enables the continuous funding \nof  essential  health  and  other  basic  services  as  well  as  priority  activities  outlined  in  the \ngovernment\u2019s development policy letter (Appendix 3). The loan for subprogram 1 will have a 15-\nyear term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge \nof 0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The \nloans for subprogram 2 and 3 are in the pipelines for 2019 and 2020, respectively. \n \n19.  The  project  investment  is  estimated to  cost  $104.5 million  (Table  1).  Detailed  cost \nestimates are included in the project administration manual (PAM).20 \n \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \nItem  Amount ($ million)a \nA.  Base Costb    \n 1.

As various project activities under the SDP will include a continuation of the Rural Health \nProject, the existing project management unit (PMU) established for the Rural Health Project at \nthe DOH will continue with the implementation of the SDP project investment.21 Over a period of \n18 months, the PMU will have dual accountabilities as they simultaneously close the Rural Health \nProject and incrementally launch the SDP project investment, thus leveraging the institutional \nknowledge and established relationships. The DOH will extend the contracts of all PMU staff for \nthe full duration of the SDP project investment through contract variations selected on Single \nSource Selection. During the overlapping period between the Rural Health Project and the SDP \nproject investment, 80% of the value of the PMU staff contract will continue to be funded by the \nRural Health Project and 20% will be funded under the SDP project investment. All consultants \nwill be recruited following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time).  \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n23.  Through improved health system stewardship, better PFM, and evidence-based planning, \nthe population of PNG (about 8 million) is expected to benefit from the SDP. Direct health facility \nupgrades will benefit at least 250,000 people. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n24.  The technical feasibility was found to be adequate after examination of the project\u2019s \ncompatibility with local conditions in rural health. Facility design plans prepared under the Rural \nHealth Project incorporate function, engineering, environmental, security, and economic aspects; \nand include infection and fire control, accident prevention, and access ramps. Resource-efficient \nmeasures,  including  solar  panels,  effective  health  care  waste  management  systems,  and \nrainwater capture, will be adopted. The digital health information system is endorsed by DOH as \nthe national information system and will support real-time data collection and report generation. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n25.  Economic analysis. The majority of project resources will be allocated to upgrading \nhealth facilities. Quantified project benefits include (i) greater productivity with reduced incidence \nand severity of illnesses resulting in fewer lost days of work; (ii) productivity gains from reduced \nmortality, particularly among mothers and newborn infants; (iii) improved productivity with fewer \n                                                \n21 The PMU is for the project only. The program steering committee will be responsible for implementation of the SDP. \n ", "8 \nwork days lost to caring for sick relatives and attending funerals; (iv) household savings from \nlower travel costs; and (v) shorter waits for health services. The proposed project yields an \neconomic internal rate of return of 10.1%, exceeding the economic opportunity cost of capital for \nsocial sector and poverty-targeting projects of 6.0%. The project is considered economically \nviable. Based on the total disability-adjusted life years lost to the leading childhood and maternal \nillnesses and infectious diseases, the economic losses in 2015 are estimated to be 9.6%\u201319.3% \nof gross national income, which can be interpreted as the upper limit of the impacts of the SDP \nthrough health gains. \n \n26.  The benefit\u2013cost ratio for the combination of reform measures is estimate at 4.6:1.0. \nSensitivity analysis results confirm that the economic viability is not particularly sensitive to \nunexpected cost escalations. Under stress scenarios regarding realization of quantified benefit \nstreams, the economic viability is generally maintained. The main risk is a scenario where \nproductivity gains are not realized from reducing illnesses following project implementation, a \nhighly unlikely scenario. Efficiency gains from the combination of improvements to regulatory \nframeworks and systems, and capacity development supported by the project are expected to \ngenerate extra fiscal space, which in turn can be channeled toward more productive expenditure. \n \n27.  Financial sustainability. The financial analysis demonstrates that the government has \nthe intention and potentially sufficient resources to meet the maintenance needs of at least eight \nupgraded health facilities in the future. Together with commitments to ring-fence funds from the \nDepartment of Treasury (DOT), the capability of provincial governments to maintain the sites and \nallocate financing for operations and maintenance are a determining factor in the finalization of \nfacility locations. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n28.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines and identified several financial management risks in staffing, information systems and \nfunds flow. The overall inherent risk was assessed to be substantial, and project risks were also \nassessed to be substantial. Effective mitigation of these risks will be supported by continuing with \nthe demonstrated structures established under the Rural Health Project.22  \n \n29.  A project procurement risk assessment was undertaken revealing that DOH and provincial \ngovernments are capable of preparing and managing ADB-funded procurements. The larger and \nmore complex procurement under the project will increase the number of procurements and \ncontracts to be managed by the PMU, compared with the Rural Health Project. Adequate PMU \nstaffing and the continuation of selected Rural Health Project PMU staff who have proven \ntechnical expertise and competencies in procurement will mitigate any risks stemming from this. \n \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith DOT (the executing agency) and the implementing agencies. The policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 20). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  Health-seeking patterns are influenced by a variety of factors, including availability of \nmedicines, distance to and cleanliness of health facilities. The expansion of rural health services \nunder the project (with an estimated catchment of 250,000 persons) will support people-centered \nhealth services and improve access by reducing travel time and costs as well as the quality of \n                                                \n22  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \ncare, which is critical according to the conducted poverty and social assessment, whereby \ncommunities stressed the importance of proximity because of cultural and cost considerations. \nThe upgrade of health facilities will also create 200 temporary jobs. Selection of health facilities \nto be upgraded will be on the basis of a transparent selection criteria to be defined by the Project \nSteering Group which will continue under the PMU (para 22).  \n \n32.  Gender. Women and children typically access health services more than men. The project \nis categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan was prepared and agreed \nwith the government.23 Key gender features include establishing gender-friendly health facilities, \nupskilling the health workforce on reproductive health and maternal health, training in gender-\nbased budgeting, and implementing sex-disaggregated reporting. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n33.  Environment. The project is category B for environment. An environmental assessment \nand  review  framework  and  initial  environmental  examination,  including  an  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP), was prepared. The project will include small-scale physical works on \nexisting health facility sites and is not anticipated to have significant or irreversible negative \nenvironmental impacts. The anticipated impacts and risks are localized, small-scale, and most \nwill occur during the construction stage and can be readily mitigated with measures set out in the \nEMP. Some operational environmental impacts are anticipated, including solid and medical waste, \nwastewater,  noise, fugitive  dust,  and  occupational  health  and  safety. These  environmental \nimpacts are anticipated to be minor and will be managed through the conventional operation and \nmaintenance practices, health and safety codes, and health care waste management that are \nincluded in the EMP. The project will establish a grievance redress mechanism to resolve \ncomplaints or issues. The capacity of implementing agency will be built to carry out environmental \nsafeguard  and  compliance  measures,  along  with  capacity  to  manage  related  risks  and \nimplementation of the environmental assessment and review framework. \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement. The project is category C for involuntary resettlement. It is not \nexpected to cause any physical or economic displacements as it will involve upgrades of existing \nhealth infrastructure on government-owned or church-leased land. A resettlement framework was \nprepared for unanticipated impacts, and due diligence for the first proposed subproject confirm \nthat it is located on government-owned land and will not require land acquisition or resettlement. \nNo involuntary resettlement impact is associated with the policy actions under the program. All \nkey stakeholders were consulted and will continue to be consulted during implementation. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples. The project is category C for indigenous peoples. It is not expected \nto impact any vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009). The subprojects will not require an indigenous peoples plan, but will ensure \nthat the local communities actively participate and receive culturally appropriate benefits. No \nindigenous people impacts are associated with the policy actions under the project. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n36.  The overall risk is substantial, but manageable when applying the mitigating measures. \nIntegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasure are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan (footnote 22). \n                                                \n23  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Rating  Mitigating Measures \nMacroeconomic  High  Policy reforms supported through the three subprograms will trigger the release of \nbudget support funds that will help ease the foreign exchange imbalance. \nWeak governance  Substantial  DOT committed to ring-fencing resources for the health sector and improving \nand sustainability of  sustainability of financing under the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy.

ASSURANCES \n \n37.  The government and DOT have assured ADB that implementation of the SDP shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and DOT have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the SDP, which are set forth in the loan agreements. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n38.
