In  September  2005,  the  International  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards  Board \n(IPSASB)  of  the  International  Federation  of  Accountants  (IFAC) 1   requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to continue to support its program for \nfurther development and production of a series of accounting guidelines and standards to \nenhance financial reporting, accounting, and auditing in the public sector.2 The accounting \nguidelines  and  standards  would  be  applicable  to  most  governments  of  ADB\u2019s  developing \nmember countries (DMCs). To help IPSASB undertake the program, ADB provided regional \ntechnical assistance (RETA) to IPSASB in October 2002 (Second Phase),3 following successful \ncompletion of the first phase of the RETA provided in 1997.4 The World Bank and other \ninternational organizations cofinanced both RETAs. \n \n2.  The following were achieved under the first and second phases of the RETAs: \n \n(i)  The comprehensive cash basis International Public Sector Accounting Standards \n(IPSAS) was issued. \n(ii) 21  accrual  basis  IPSAS  were  released:  IPSAS  1  (Presentation  of  Financial \nStatements), IPSAS 2 (Cash Flow Statements), IPSAS 3 (Net Surplus or Deficit for \nthe Period, Fundamental Errors and Changes in Accounting Policies), IPSAS 4 (The \nEffects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates), IPSAS 5 (Borrowing Costs), IPSAS \n6 (Consolidated Financial Statements and Accounting for Controlled Entities), IPSAS \n7  (Accounting  for  Investments  in  Associates),  IPSAS  8  (Financial  Reporting  of \nInterest  in  Joint  Ventures),  IPSAS  9  (Revenue  from  Exchange  Transactions), \nIPSAS 10  (Financial  Reporting  in  Hyperinflationary  Economies),  IPSAS  11 \n(Construction Contracts), IPSAS 12 (Inventories), IPSAS 13 (Leases), IPSAS 14 \n(Events After the Reporting Date), IPSAS 15 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and \nPresentation),  IPSAS  16  (Investment  Property),  IPSAS  17  (Property,  Plant  and \nEquipment),  IPSAS  18  (Segment  Reporting),  IPSAS  19  (Provisions,  Contingent \nLiabilities  and  Contingent  Assets),  IPSAS  20  (Related  Party  Disclosures),  and \nIPSAS 21 (Impairment of Non-Cash-Generating Assets).  \n(iii) Study 14 \u201cTransition to the Accrual Basis of Accounting\u201d was revised and published.  \n(iv) The Handbook of International Public Sector Pronouncement 2005 was translated \ninto French and Spanish. \n(v) The development of IPSAS on key public sector projects was well advanced. \n \n3.  The IPSAS provided the foundation for achieving the long-term objectives of (i) moving \nto full-fledged accrual accounting in the future for both developed and developing countries; and \n(ii) improving the quality and reliability of accounting and financial reporting for the public sector. \nFollowing successful completion of the second phase RETA, IPSASB requested ADB to provide \na third phase to finance the ongoing accounting standard development program for 2006\u20132008. \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1.5\n  \n                                                 \n1  IFAC was established in 1973 and was formally approved by the International Congress of Accountants in 1977. \nThe IFAC board established the Public Sector Committee in 1986 to issue pronouncements on accounting, \nauditing, and reporting in the public sector on IFAC\u2019s behalf. Effective 10 November 2004, IPSASB replaced the \nPublic Sector Committee. \n2 \u201cPublic sector\u201d refers to (i) national governments; (ii) regional (state and provincial) governments; (iii) local (city and \ntown) governments; and (iv) related government entities (agencies, boards, commissions, and enterprises). \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards (Second Phase). Manila (for $245,000). \n4  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance for Government Accounting Standards.

As of December 2005, the following projects were in progress:  \n(i)  Five exposure drafts (EDs): (a) ED 24, \u201cFinancial Reporting Under the Cash Basis of \nAccounting  \u2013  Disclosure  Requirements  for  Recipients  of  External  Assistance\u201d; \n(b) ED 25, \u201cEqual Authority of Paragraphs in IPSAS\u201d; (c) ED 26, \u201cImprovements to \nInternational  Public  Sector  Accounting  Standards\u201d;  (d)  ED  27,  \u201cPresentation  of \nBudget Information in Financial Statements\u201d; and (e) ED 28, \u201cDisclosure of Financial \nInformation about the General Government Sector\u201d.  \n(ii) Revenue from Non-Exchange Transactions. \n(iii) Accounting for Social Policy Obligations of Governments.  \n(iv) Heritage Assets. \n(v) Impairment of Cash Generating Assets.  \nThese projects will be developed during the third phase of the IPSAS development program. \nDuring consultation with representatives of IPSASB member countries, DMC governments, \naccounting bodies, the accounting profession, and multilateral financial institutions, IPSASB \nrecognized  the  complexity  of  establishing  accounting  standards  for  the  public  sector  and \nenhanced the work program for the next phase to address concerns and issues raised. \n \n5.  IPSASB\u2019s ongoing work program will have significant impact on DMCs\u2019 financial and \naccounting reporting requirements and auditing procedures, as IPSASB was established to \nprovide accounting standards for accountancy bodies and the profession in the public sector \nworldwide. \n \n6.  Development of accrual IPSAS on uniquely public sector issues required significant \ninvestment of IPSASB resources. The process required extensive consultation to ensure that \nIPSASB\u2019s  constituents  understand  the  conceptual  basis  for  a  proposed  financial  reporting \ntreatment and accept IPSASB\u2019s final decision. It was important not to underestimate the amount \nof time and consultation required. In addition, IPSASB was not in a position to keep up-to-date \nwith International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)6 developments given its current resource \nlevels. IASB had a full-time, salaried board, and a much larger staff than IPSASB; and had an \noperating  budget  of  $17.00  million  for  2005  compared  with  IPSASB\u2019s  $1.05  million.  IASB \nreissued  most  of  the  International  Accounting  Standards  (IAS)  and  International  Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRS) on which 19 of the 21 IPSAS were based. The differences in the \nIPSAS and IFRS presented difficulties for some governments in implementing accrual financial \nreporting. \n \n7.  Nonetheless, IPSASB realized that it was timely to undertake a broad review of its work \nprogram and longer-term strategy, and the resource requirements. IPSASB members agreed \nthat such a review should include additional resources to be provided to IPSASB in support of \ncollaborative projects with national standards setters and similar bodies or other parties. \n \n8.  While  IPSASB  has  developed  and  produced  a  series  of  accounting  guidelines, \nstandards, and studies under the second phase of the TA, many important tasks remain to be \ncompleted. The second phase program of IPSASB could not fully cover all the public sector \n                                                 \n6  IASB was formed in 1973 and has been based in London with the original name of International Accounting \nStandard Committee. IASB\u2019s mission is to develop worldwide accounting standards for the business sector. IASB \nis an independent body with close links to national standard-setting bodies in countries worldwide. Fourteen board \nmembers come from many countries and represent a variety of professional backgrounds. \n ", "3\n \naccounting issues and concerns. Due to uncertain funding resources, one technical manager \nleft IPSASB for IASB, and the technical director who had worked for IPSASB for more than \n10 years has resigned. This has significantly affected timely progress of the work program. \n \n9.  Improvement of accounting and financial reporting in the public sector is a long-term \nprocess. The funding shortage has significantly affected IPSASB\u2019s work program. IPSASB has \nrequested that ADB continue to provide financial support to its ongoing IPSAS development \nprogram. \n \n10.  Throughout the implementation of the proposed third phase TA, ADB will continue to \nclosely monitor and assist in the progress of IPSASB\u2019s activities in drawing up EDs and IPSAS, \nparticularly to (i) implement accrual basis accounting, (ii) standardize cash basis accounting, \nand (iii) enhance DMCs\u2019 institutional capacities in preparing their financial statements. ADB, as \nan observer to IPSASB, will continue to attend IPSASB\u2019s conferences and meetings, in addition \nto guidance on the direction of IPSASB\u2019s work program. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  is  envisioned  to  (i)  facilitate,  in  the  long  run,  accounting  policy  reform, \naccountability and capacity strengthening of DMCs; and (ii) improve the government (public \nsector)  accounting  system.  Improvement  in  the  public  sector  accounting  system  would  be \ninstrumental for DMCs to achieve good governance. Therefore, the third phase of IPSASB\u2019s \nwork program is in line with ADB\u2019s development agenda on good governance, anticorruption, \nand an enhanced government fiscal management system. \n \n12.  The impact of the TA will be to support IPSASB in further developing and issuing a \nseries of accounting guidelines and standards for the government (public sector), which would \nbe used by DMCs. \n \n13.  The outcome of the TA consists of three main components: (i) further development of \naccrual basis IPSAS related to public sector specific topics, (ii) development of IPSAS related to \nIFRS and general government sector (GGS) convergence program, and (iii) review of the \nimplementation of the cash basis IPSAS. The IPSASB work program is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The key activities of the third phase work program for 2006\u20132008 are to (i) complete \ndevelopment of public sector specific IPSAS; (ii) finalize IPSAS for the six EDs under review, \ni.e., EDs 24 to 28 (para 4) and ED 29, \u201cRevenue from Non-Exchange Transactions (including \ntaxes and transfers)\u201d; (iii) draft IPSAS on a number of key public sector issues dealing with such \nmatters as converging IPSAS with IFRS and converging IPSAS with the statistical base of \nfinancial reporting of GGS; (iv) implement activities to promote IPSAS; and (v) translate IPSAS \ninto two key languages other than English, such as French and Spanish, with support from IASB. \n \n15.  All  IPSAS  developed  during  the  third  phase  work  program  will  be  published  and \ndistributed to all IFAC members, and can be downloaded from the IFAC website. IPSAS EDs \nand the studies will be made available free of charge. Hard copies will be mailed directly to \n1,500  registrants  on  IFAC  and  IPSASB  mailing  lists,  including  all  DMCs.  Copies  can  be \ndownloaded free of charge at http://ifac.org. \n ", "4       \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The  total  cost  for  the  third  phase  work  program  for  2006\u20132008  is  estimated  at \n$3,617,000  equivalent. ADB will provide $245,000 to be disbursed in three tranches equivalent \nto 6.8% of the total. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nOther multilateral aid agencies, governments, and other organizations which are expected to \nprovide parallel financing of $2,185,000 are (i) the World Bank, $750,000; (ii) Government of \nCanada, $450,000; (iii) Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, $400,000; (iv) Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China, $100,000; (v) United Nations, $225,000; (vi) Inter-American \nDevelopment  Bank,  $100,000;  (vii)  European  Commission,  $150,000;  and  (viii) Moody\u2019s, \n$10,000. IFAC will provide $1,187,000 to fill the gap. Support from the Government of Canada \nand  its  accounting  institution  will  help  IPSASB  a  great  deal  in  future  financing.  However, \nIPSASB will have to move to Montreal or Toronto from New York. Details of the cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  IPSASB, the executing agency of the earlier two RETAs, will also be the Executing \nAgency for the TA. IPSASB will administer TA funds and make all related organizational and \nadministrative  arrangements  in  accordance  with  standard  procedures.  As  an  observer  of \nIPSASB, ADB will monitor and directly supervise TA activities. IPSASB will benefit from ADB\u2019s \nexperience and technical expertise. ADB will also provide direct input to the work of IPSASB by \nreviewing its EDs and reflecting on comments from IFAC\u2019s ADB member countries before IFAC \nissues any guidelines and directives. With this continuing TA support, ADB will continue to be \ngiven \u201cobserver\u201d status along with other funding agencies to attend IPSASB\u2019s meetings to \nparticipate in its standard-setting programs. \n \n18.  TA  implementation  will  commence  in  August  2006  and  will  be  completed  in \nDecember 2008. TA funds will be released to IFAC annually in three installments based on \nsubmission of annual progress reports to ADB and the outputs indicated in the annual work \nprogram. The first installment will be disbursed to IFAC in the third quarter of 2006 upon its \nsigning of the TA letter of agreement. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $245,000 on a grant basis for \nPublic Sector Accounting Standards (Third Phase), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "                    Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \n  Performance  Sources/Monitoring   \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions \n       \nImpact       \nEnhance financial  Published accounting  IPSASB annual progress  \u2022 IPSASB is competent in this \nreporting, accounting,  standards for the  reports   area \nauditing, and good  public sector  \u2022 IPSASB will deliver the \ngovernance in the \nrequired results \npublic sector to achieve \nlong-term economic \nobjectives and directly \nbenefit developing \nmember countries and \ninternational agencies \n       \nOutcome       \nEnhance financial  Published accrual  IPSASB annual progress  \u2022 IPSASB is committed to \nreporting, accounting,  basis accounting  reports   achieving the TA goals \nauditing, and good  related to public  IPSASB completion  \u2022 Funds from ADB, other co-\ngovernance in the  sector specific topics, \nreport  financiers, IPSASB, and \npublic sector  IPSAS related to IAS, \n  IFAC are available for this TA \n  IFRS and GGS \nconvergence \nprogram, and review \nof the implementation \nof the cash basis \nIPSAS \n       \nOutputs       \nDevelopment of accrual  Number of published  Review of exposure  \u2022 IPSASB  is  competent  and \nbasis IPSAS related to  accounting standards  drafts and other  committed to do its best \npublic sector specific  for the public sector  documents  \u2022 ADB is committed to provide \ntopics  and other reports, \nAttendance by an ADB  guidance and direction \n  such as exposure \nrepresentative at IPSASB   \n  drafts \nconferences to provide   \n   \nguidance and direction   \n   \n   \nDevelopment of IPSAS  Number of DMCs  IPSASB annual progress  \u2022 All DMCs that are members \nin the six exposure  furnished with IPSAS  reports  of IFAC are sent hard copies \ndrafts under review  developed during the    of documents or referred to \ncompleted  third phase    the IFAC website \n       \nDevelopment of IPSAS  Published IPSAS  IPSASB annual progress  \u2022 IPSASB is committed to \ncommenced on a    reports   achieving such convergence \nnumber of key public      programs \nsector specific issues       \ndealing with such       \nmatters as converging       \nIPSAS with IAS/IFRS,       \nand converging IPSAS       \nwith the statistical base       \nof financial reporting of       \n  \nGGS       \n ", "6          Appendix 1            \n     \n    Data   \n  Performance  Sources/Monitoring   \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions \n       \n \nPromotion of the IPSAS       \ncontinued      \u2022 IPSAS are developed during \n  Number of languages    the third phase \nArrange for translation  into which IPSAS are  IPSASB annual progress  \u2022 IASB is committed to support \nof IPSAS into two key  translated  reports   the translation of IPSAS \nlanguages other than \nIPSASB completion \nEnglish, such as \nreport \nFrench and Spanish, \nwith the support of \nIASB \nActivities with Milestones  \u2022 Inputs \n1.
