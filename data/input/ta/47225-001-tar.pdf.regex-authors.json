This technical assistance (TA) builds on support provided under a small-scale TA project \napproved in 2012 (Improving Fiscal Revenue Mobilization),1 which provided capacity building \nsupport  to  the  Foreign  Exchange  Control  and  External  Debt  Division  within  the  Budget \nDepartment of the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The TA also supported the conduct of a debt \nmanagement self-assessment, and the design of a proposed debt management division (DMD) \nwithin a new Treasury Department to be established by the next fiscal year.  \n \n2.  Follow-on support will be needed over the medium term to allow for broader institutional \nreforms  and  capacity  building,  necessary  for  the  establishment  of  an  effective  institutional \nframework for sound public debt management. This will include support for strengthening of the \nMOF\u2019s capacity for debt recording and management through the establishment of a modern \ndebt management and recording system and related capacity building support.  Support will \nalso be needed to more broadly develop the institutional framework and capacity for public debt \nmanagement. In this regard, this TA will support the establishment and operationalization of a \nDMD within the Treasury Department of the MOF, which will assume primary responsibility for \npublic debt management, development of a modern legal and regulatory framework for public \ndebt, and development of the domestic market for government securities. \n \n3.  In response to the government\u2019s request for follow-on support, the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  conducted  a  fact-finding  mission  on  9\u201318  September  2013,  and  reached  an \nagreement with the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost, financing arrangements, and consultant terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The government\u2019s extensive reform program and its related financing requirements will \nnecessitate  the  establishment  of  an  effective  institutional  framework  for  sound  public  debt \nmanagement  to  ensure  that  policy  objectives  can  be  met  on  a  sustainable  basis  without \ncompromising macroeconomic stability. As a first step, this will require support for strengthening \nof basic capacity related to debt recording and management. Over the medium term, support \nwill also be needed for development of a clear legal framework for public debt management and \nestablishment  of  an  institutional  focal  point  with  primary  responsibility  for  public  debt \nmanagement (i.e., a principal debt management entity). \n \n5.  Responsibility  for  public  debt  management  is  currently  split  between  the  Budget \nDepartment  of  the  MOF  and  the  Central  Bank  of  Myanmar  (CBM)\u2014with  management  of \ndomestic debt being handled by the Financial Markets Department of the CBM, and external \ndebt management being the responsibility of the Foreign Exchange Control and External Debt \nDivision of the Budget Department of the MOF. This makes it difficult for the government to \nobtain a consolidated picture of its debt position. \n \n6.  In part to address the issue of institutional fragmentation, the International Monetary \nFund (IMF) has recommended the creation of a separate Treasury Department within the MOF \nthat would include a DMD, which will have primary responsibility for management of external as \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for Improving Fiscal Revenue \nMobilization. Manila (TA 8156). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 November 2013. \n ", "2   \nwell  as  domestic  public  debt.  This  would  involve  the  transfer,  to  the  new  division,  of \nresponsibility  for  external  debt  management  from  the  MOF\u2019s  Budget  Department  and \nresponsibility for domestic debt management from the CBM\u2019s Financial Markets Department. \nThe government has agreed in principle with these recommendations and intends to establish \nthe new department by the next fiscal year (beginning 1 April 2014).  \n \n7.  At the request of the government and in coordination with other development partners, \nADB has provided initial support to help define the structure and functions of the proposed DMD. \nCapacity building support will be needed for DMD staff to effectively carry out new functions and \nresponsibilities,  particularly  since,  given  Myanmar\u2019s  limited  international  engagement  until \nrecently, the external debt function of the Foreign Exchange Control and External Debt Division \nhas  largely  been  limited  to  that  of  record  keeping,  which  is  mainly  carried  out  manually. \nComplementary support will also be needed to strengthen this function through the acquisition \nand operationalization of a modern debt recording and management system (DRMS). \n \n8.  Correspondingly, a modern legal and regulatory framework for public debt management \nwill need to be developed. Public debt management is currently largely based on a set of \npractices that constitute an informal framework. To allow for effective management of public \ndebt, the government will need to consider and work toward the development of a legal and \nregulatory framework that clearly defines the authority and responsibility to borrow, issue debt, \nand  execute  transactions  on  behalf  of  the  government;  specifies  clear  objectives  for  debt \nmanagement expressed in terms of cost and risk; makes explicit the purposes of borrowing and \nthe  scope  of  debt  management  operations;  mandates  the  preparation  of  a  public  debt \nmanagement strategy; clarifies the respective roles and responsibilities of key agencies in public \ndebt management; and establishes accountability and reporting requirements. \n \n9.  In  conjunction  with  basic  capacity  building  for  debt  management,  ADB  has  also \nsupported the government\u2019s  conduct  of a  debt management  performance  self-assessment. \nFollowing  the  completion  of  this  self-assessment,  a  joint  development  partner  mission \n(comprising ADB, the IMF, the World Bank, and the US Treasury) was undertaken to provide \ncomprehensive  and  coordinated  support  for  development  of  the  government\u2019s  public  debt \nmanagement function. Building on the findings of the self-assessment, the joint mission, in \nconsultation with the government, has mapped out short-, medium-, and long-term needs along \nwith proposed support by development partners. Under this, the IMF would principally focus on \nsupport for cash management; the World Bank would provide capacity building support at a \nlater stage through a proposed public financial management (PFM) training institute (under a \nbroader PFM reform program); the US Treasury would provide support for domestic debt market \ndevelopment; while ADB would support operationalization of the new DMD under the Treasury \nDepartment. \n \n10.  Development partners have also coordinated closely on broader support for PFM. The \ngovernment has come up with a PFM reform strategy based on the findings of a recently \ncompleted public expenditure and financial accountability assessment conducted by the World \nBank  in  collaboration  with  the  MOF.  Feedback from  development  partners  has  been  very \npositive and development partners have responded by drafting a set of partnership principles \nand indicating areas of current and proposed support for the strategy. Among the multilaterals, \nADB and the IMF will focus on support for the new Treasury Department (with the IMF focusing \non cash management and ADB on debt management), while the World Bank will focus on \nsupport  for  the  Budget  Department  and  will  also  cover  other  aspects  of  PFM  such  as \nprocurement. \n \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA impact will be management of public debt on a sound and sustainable basis. \nRelevant indicators include an improvement in the country risk rating for debt distress from \nmoderate to low (assessed by debt sustainability analyses conducted as part of the annual IMF \nArticle  IV  consultation),  and  a  debt  management  performance  assessment  that  will  be \nundertaken toward the end of the TA. \n \n12.  The TA outcome will be establishment of an institutional framework and related capacity \nfor effective public debt management. Relevant indicators include (i) strengthening capacity for \npublic  debt  recording  and  management  (performance  target:  procurement  and \noperationalization of a DRMS); and (ii) establishment and operationalization of a DMD within the \nMOF  (performance  target:  new  division  is  established  and  staffed  with  adequately  trained \npersonnel). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA\u2019s outcome will be supported through the following outputs: (i) acquisition and \noperationalization of a DRMS, (ii) development of an organization plan defining the structure of \na DMD and the road map for developing its public debt management functions, and (iii) support \nfor strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for public debt management. Capacity \nbuilding support will also be provided for implementation of the outputs noted above, including \nidentification  and  engagement  of  resource  people  from  counterpart  institutions  and/or  the \nestablishment of peer-to-peer twinning arrangements with existing, well-functioning public debt \nmanagement  offices  in  the  region.  With  respect  to  implementation,  a  key  assumption  is \ncontinued strong government ownership of reforms. Risks include the possibility of unforeseen \ncrises placing large and unavoidable demands on the government\u2019s fiscal position. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide counterpart support \nfor TA implementation through their existing, day-to-day operations and budget, which includes \ncounterpart  staff  time  and  access  to  materials  and  facilities  needed,  and  other  in-kind \ncontribution. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The MOF will serve as both executing and implementing agency for the TA. Other \nimplementing agencies include the CBM. While the focus of capacity development under the TA \nwill be with the DMD, the CBM will be involved in the development of an interagency agreement \nas well as the development of the legal and regulatory framework for public debt management. \n \n16.  Consulting inputs will be provided through the engagement of individual consultants \nconsisting  of  (i)  a  debt  recording  and  management  system  expert  (4  person-months, \ninternational); (ii) a public debt management expert (12 person-months, international); (iii) a \npublic debt regulatory and institutional framework expert (6 person-months, international); and \n(iv)  a  project  coordinator  (18  person-months,  national).  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \n ", "4   \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  Provision will also be made for the acquisition of a DRMS for the MOF. This will include \nprovision  of  hardware,  software,  and  related  training.  A  significant  number  of  low-income, \ndeveloping, or emerging market countries use the Debt Management and Financial Analysis \nSystem (DMFAS) developed and supported by the United Nations Conference on Trade and \nDevelopment (UNCTAD) in Geneva. The DMFAS provides functionality that is best suited for \nexternal debt from bilateral and multilateral sources, and its procurement and implementation \nhas been supported by ADB in a number of developing member countries\u2014including some in \nSoutheast Asia. \n \n18.  The  TA  will  provide  support  to  the  MOF  in  assessing  its  needs  and  procuring  an \nappropriate package of software, training, and hardware for implementation of the DMFAS, \nbased on consultations with UNCTAD. Procurement of software and related training will be \nconducted by direct contracting, based on choice of system by the MOF. Hardware for the \nsystem will be purchased using the shopping method of procurement. \n \n19.  The TA, to be administered by ADB, will be implemented  during December 2013\u2013 \nMarch  2016.  Proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.
