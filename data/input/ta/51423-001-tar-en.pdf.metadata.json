THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Mongolia,  during  the  country  programming  mission  held  in \nUlaanbaatar in March 2018, requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide lending \nsupport to prepare the Vegetable Production and Irrigated Agriculture Project. The ensuing loan \nis included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia and the proposed transaction \ntechnical assistance (TA) is included in ADB\u2019s nonlending pipeline for 2018.1  \n \n2.  Farming remains an underdeveloped sector in Mongolia, despite high potential for growth \nand livelihood opportunities, particularly in the country\u2019s central region, spanning Darkhan-Uul, \nSelenge, and Tuv aimags. In line with the government\u2019s focus to promote livelihood opportunities \noutside traditional livestock herding and mining, agriculture (including smallholder vegetable \nfarming) has fast become a priority for growth. Mongolia has made strides over the past decade \nto become self-sufficient in and mechanized cereal and potato production, but vegetable farming \nhas been neglected and is not yet very productive. This perpetuates low income for vegetable \nfarmers and high reliance on imported products, which in turn threatens national food security.  \n \n3.  The project aims to increase income and employment opportunities for rural households \nby implementing a community farming model, providing a sustainable irrigation system, securing \naccess to value chain support services and infrastructure, and improving farm-to-market linkages. \nThe project will: (i) rehabilitate irrigation systems and integrate farming groups into inclusive \nagriculture value chains in up to six aimags; (ii) set up cold storage, packaging, and wholesale \ntrading capacity in Ulaanbaatar; and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity and coordination to \nenable sustainable and inclusive use of project supported irrigation systems and value chain \nfacilities, including strengthening of farmer capacity on proper use of chemicals and fertilizers (e.g. \nintegrated pest management and good agriculture practice).  \n \n4.  The ensuing project is estimated to cost $42.4 million. ADB is requested to finance $40.0 \nmillion largely for investment and capacity building through a loan. A $2.0 million cofinanced grant2 \nwill be processed in parallel with the loan. Central and local governments will provide in-kind \ncontribution equivalent to $0.4 million. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The executing agency, the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry (MOFALI), has \nlimited experience with ADB requirements for loan preparation. The transaction TA will help the \ngovernment prepare a project design that complies with the ADB requirements and international \nbest practice.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2019\u20132021.

Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $0.85 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. \n \n8.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, domestic \ntransport, data collection, logistic support in arranging workshops and field visits, and other in-\nkind contributions. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB \nto finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TA. A multisector steering committee, chaired by the MOFALI \nState Secretary and including representatives from the aimag and central agencies, will guide the \nproject. A project implementation unit will be established at MOFALI to coordinate and implement \nthe project. The TA will be implemented over 11 months, tentatively from November 2018 to \nSeptember 2019. Equipment for the TA consultants will be procured following ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time), and handed over to MOFALI upon the TA completion. \nDisbursement under the TA will be in line with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n10.
