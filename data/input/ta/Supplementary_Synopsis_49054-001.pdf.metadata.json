Inadequate  access  to  timely  weather,  market  information  and  technical  support  for \nagricultural operations has always been one of the major constraints to farmers' productivity and \nprofitability in developing member countries (DMCs). Inefficiencies in agriculture amount to \nsignificant economic and social costs as food prices remain high and volatile, threatening food \nsecurity  and  malnutrition  among  lower-income  strata  of  the  population.  Emerging  digital \ntechnologies have significant potential to provide these services to dispersed smallholders, \ntraders, agro-processors, and consumers at much lower cost in a timely manner.  \n \n2.  This TA aims to bridge the information gap by providing five digital service platforms to \nrelay (i) weather forecasts and alerts, (ii) irrigation scheduling advice, (iii) wholesale market prices, \nsale volumes and analytics, (iv) online agricultural extension services, and (v) virtual call-center \nfor agricultural extension services. Some of these services exist, in one form or another, in many \nDMCs. But they are not integrated and the quality does not meet standards to create a larger \nimpact on the agricultural productivity of smallholders. ADB studied the use of digital services for \nagriculture in Pakistan in the last three years. The TA proposes to further develop and roll out \nthese services widely in Pakistan, and subsequently extend these services in Bangladesh, \nTajikistan, and Viet Nam. This synopsis provides a more detailed structure, design, and vision of \nthese services.  \n \n3.  Weather  forecasts  and  alerts.  The  Pakistan  Meteorological  Department  (PMD) \ngenerates weather forecasts and updates and provides alerts every few hours for each climatic \nzone. Forecasts are disseminated through its web and electronic media. Farmers and other \nstakeholders of agricultural value chains (AVCs) need area-specific and real-time alerts to plan \nand adjust their operations accordingly. A smartphone application can relay PMD weather \nforecasts more frequently for a preferred area. This is more beneficial because weather forecasts \nbecome highly reliable as the interval between alerts is reduced. If farmers receive advice with \nhigh probability, they can adjust farming operations accordingly, and improve productivity and \nprofits. Hence, a smartphone application is proposed to access PMD forecasts and alerts in real-\ntime and transmit to the users every few hours.    \n \n4.  Irrigation scheduling. Farmers irrigate their fields when the soil surface is dry, even when \nthere is sufficient moisture in the rootzone. Consequently, farmers often apply more water than \nrequired. Experts can accurately assess the need for irrigation by estimating evapotranspiration \nof crops using satellite imagery. The University of Washington, Pullman in the United States \nimplemented a pilot project in collaboration with the Pakistan Council for Research in Water \nResources where farmers are advised, via SMS, when to irrigate regardless of when they \nintended to irrigate. Participating farmers have reported using 30% less water without impact or \ndecline in wheat yield, all else being equal. The pilot project presents an opportunity to upscale \nthis service at the national level. Through the smartphone application, farmers can subscribe to \nthis service to receive real-time irrigation scheduling advice. This service will be integrated with \nthe weather forecasts so that farmers can plan irrigation and other operations accordingly. \n \n5.  Wholesale  market  prices,  sale  volumes  and  analytics.  Of  all  the  risks  farmers \nface\u2500weather,  crop  diseases,  pest  attacks,  business,  financial,  and  marketing\u2500the  most \ndevastating is the market risk. A great majority of the farmers do not make fair profits because \ntheir access to market information is limited. The most important aspect of marketing is price \n \n1  This synopsis provides more detailed description of proposed digital services which is constrained given the TA \nformat and structure. ", "discovery which depends on the commodity\u2019s supply and demand.  Market information, prices, \nsale volumes, and analytics, are not readily available to all stakeholders, especially farmers. The \nproposed smartphone appllication will provide real-time price information and price analytics. \nPakistan has more than 900 wholesale markets with 550 in Punjab alone. This smartphone \napplication  will  provide  commodity  prices  at  key  wholesale  markets  from  two  sources:  (i) \ninformation published by the wholesale market committees, and (ii) information  crowdsourced \nfrom registered traders in key markets in real-time. This application will also provide analytics of \nprices from local markets as well as those from neighboring countries and relevant international \nmarkets. The quality of this information will add significant efficiency to agricultural marketing in \nPakistan. \n \n6.  Online agricultural extension services. For adopting modern production techniques \nand technologies, effective agricultural extension services play a key role. After marketing, \nagricultural extension is the weaker link in the system. Because most farmers are smallholders \nand dispersed, they do not have proper access to extension advice. The proposed service will \nhave two digital platforms. One, via a smartphone application, and the other, through the YouTube \nchannel. The smartphone application will provide the latest content by operation (i.e., crops, \nlivestock, fisheries, etc.) in the local language. The advice will be area- and climatic zone-specific \nand automated using artificial intelligence. For instance, farmers could upload an image of \naffected crop leaves and the smartphone application could identify disease or pest attack or \nnutrient deficiency in the soil. The YouTube channel will be set up for the agricultural experts to \nupload advisory videos. These agricultural experts can be paid based on number of hits or views, \nfor instance. This business model can provide incentives to experts to improve their video content.  \n \n7.  Virtual call-center for agricultural extension services. Not all farmer concerns can be \naddressed  via  online  extension  services  or  through  YouTube  videos.  Many  farmers  need \nspecialized advice. Farmers can call for help and talk to an expert who will be able to answer \nfrequently asked questions. More complex questions can be forwarded to experts who will be \nretained on the roster. Experts will return calls within 24 hours and be paid for their services. The \nterms and conditions and fees will be set in consultation with all stakeholders and following \ngovernment rules. Similar to telehealth, this service will enable farmers to show their crops or \nlivestock via camera and remotely get advice from the experts.  \n \n8.  Business model. If these digital services are developed and provided in the form and \nquality as envisaged, there will be significant demand by farmers, traders, and agro-processors. \nThese services will be provided for free during the pilot and development phases. But once the \ndemand is steady, users will be asked to pay modest subscription and consultation fees. Given \nthe anticipated economies of scale, even modest subscription (e.g., $0.50 to $1.0 per month), can \nraise substantial revenue to run this service for profit.  \n2 \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "S03", "Creator": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Office 365", "CreationDate": "D:20191213134914+08'00'", "ModDate": "D:20191213134914+08'00'", "Producer": "Microsoft\u00ae Word for Office 365"}}
