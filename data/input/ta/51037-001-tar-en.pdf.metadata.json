INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In July 2016, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) received a request from Sri Lanka\u2019s \nMinistry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, through the Ministry of Finance and the \nMinistry of Justice (MOJ), to assist the government in enhancing the country\u2019s justice sector, \nwhich will cover legal, policy, and institutional reforms. On 28 November\u20132 December 2016, ADB \nfielded a consultation mission to assess the possibility of assistance. The mission met with high-\nlevel representatives from the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, the MOJ, the \nSupreme  Court  of  Sri  Lanka,  the  Attorney  General\u2019s  Department,  and  other  government \nstakeholders. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will focus on the justice \nsector in relation to commercial law, investment, and contract enforcement. On 6 April 2017, ADB \nvice-president for administration and corporate management approved the concept paper for the \nTA.1 \n \n2.   The TA is designed to strengthen the legal and institutional framework of the justice sector, \nspecifically in the areas of commercial law, investment, and contract enforcement, to enhance \ninvestment in Sri Lanka. Under the TA, ADB will conduct a needs assessment to identify gaps \nand priority areas, develop a 5-year strategic action plan (SAP) to serve as a road map for the \njustice sector to improve climate investment, reduce delays in contract enforcement, and increase \ninvestors\u2019 confidence to do business in Sri Lanka. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 establishes good governance and capacity development as a driver \nfor change to \u201cimprove the cost-effective delivery of public goods and services and broaden \ninclusiveness\u201d in ADB\u2019s developing member countries.2 This is further mentioned in the Midterm \nReview  of  Strategy  2020,3 emphasizing  its  importance  and  necessary  inclusion  in  sector \nassessments and road maps of country and sector reports. \n \n4.  The TA aligns with Sri Lanka\u2019s reform agenda to increase economic growth, as presented \nby the minister of finance during his 10 November 2016 speech in Parliament for the 71st budget.4 \nThe minister made special mention of improving the country\u2019s legal framework by inviting the \njudiciary to \u201cmake recommendations on possible judicial and legal reforms that will facilitate the \nprocess of creating a country to be a destination for better quality living and investment.\u201d5 The \nminister acknowledged the need to upgrade infrastructure and allocated SLRs600 million for the \nconstruction  of  court  facilities  and  automation  in  provinces  and  SLRs100  million  for  the \nestablishment of commercial courts to expedite the resolution of commercial disputes. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Sri Lanka is reaching upper middle-income country status. For the country to sustain \neconomic growth as an upper middle-income country, it is important to improve its business \nenvironment. The government has commenced an ambitious drive to attract foreign investments \nto develop Sri Lanka as a commercial hub and as a possible destination for international \ncommercial arbitration. This was reiterated by the minister of finance during his recent budget \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 May 2017. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Notwithstanding this effort, Sri Lanka\u2019s justice sector is still perceived to \nhave significant delays in dispute settlement and contract enforcement. Overall, the sector does \nnot have the efficiency and effectiveness comparable with that of a middle-income country, \nparticularly in contract and commercial law enforcement. The World Bank ranked Sri Lanka 163rd \nfor contract enforcement and 76th for resolving insolvency in its Ease of Doing Business Index \nfor 2016.6 \n \n6.  Having been influenced by the legacy of British colonial rule, the Sri Lankan justice system \nis steeped in tradition, with reforms being incremental, ad hoc, and spread over a long period. \nThere is resistance to change the justice sector, particularly from the legal fraternity. Prior to 2015, \nthe government did not encourage development partners to engage with the justice sector, which \nresulted in the sector not benefiting from the latest thinking both nationally and internationally, \nespecially in commercial law. The justice sector lacks not only resources, but also the ability to \nuse its available resources in a strategic manner. A strategic resource assessment and allocation \nhas not been done, resulting in insufficient and underutilized resources, including information \ntechnology equipment. Court automation was attempted at selected courts but has not yielded \nthe expected outcomes, because the stand-alone initiatives were not supported with parallel \nreforms in the connected physical, human, and legal systems and processes. \n \n7.  Similarly, capacity building initiatives have been ad hoc, limiting the judiciary\u2019s exposure \nto a few programs offered by the Judges\u2019 Training Institute on traditional subjects delivered from \nits auditorium in Colombo. The institute does not have a set of judicial training courses or a \ncontinuous legal education program within a defined core competency framework, and the latest \ncommercial law subjects are not included in the training initiatives. Capacity enhancement in other \nareas such as leadership, dispute settlement, stress and time management, court administration, \nand case management are also lacking in the current curriculum. These have contributed to \ninadequate judicial capacity and insufficient sophistication in dealing with the fast-changing \ncommercial dispute landscape. Outdated procedures manuals and a lack of strategic human \nresources management have exacerbated the current situation. \n \n8.  The justice sector comprises several institutions, many of which are legally independent \nof each other, which is why comprehensive reforms are extremely challenging. With increased \npressure for the justice sector to be more accountable in terms of finance, performance, integrity, \nand independence, there is now openness to and willingness for reforms. As the line ministry \ntasked with coordination, budgeting, and administration of the justice sector, the MOJ believes \nthat substantial reforms cannot be successfully effected without an overall review of the approach. \nDuring ADB\u2019s consultation mission conducted in the last quarter of 2016, the MOJ identified four \nareas  requiring  urgent  intervention  to  deal  with  ineffectiveness  and  delay:  (i) law  reforms, \n(ii) judicial infrastructure improvements, (iii) court automation, and (iv) capacity building. \n \n9.  Prioritizing sector needs to align with Sri Lanka\u2019s national development goals and policies, \nthe  MOJ  proposes  (i)  a  comprehensive  study  on  the  commercial,  legal,  and  institutional \nframework, with a view to conducting a needs assessment to identify gaps and priority concerns; \nand (ii) the development of a 5-year SAP to serve as a road map for the justice sector, with \nemphasis on commercial law, investment, and contract enforcement. These will form the basis \nfor reforms and probable support from development partners in the sector. Based on the results \n                                                \n6  The World Bank.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: foreign investors\u2019 confidence increased, \nleading  to  improved  foreign  direct  investments  in  Sri  Lanka.  The  outcome  will  be  a  SAP \nimplemented as a road map for commercial and legal regulatory framework for the justice sector \nin Sri Lanka in relation to its role in commercial law, investment, and contract enforcement.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Strategic action plan developed. ADB will conduct a comprehensive study \nthrough a needs assessment to (i) understand the overall context and the legal, regulatory, and \ninstitutional framework of the justice sector in Sri Lanka, focusing on commercial law, investment, \nand  contract  enforcement;  and  (ii)  identify  gaps  and  priority  needs.  Based  on  the  needs \nassessment, ADB will develop a 5-year SAP to serve as the road map for improving the legal \nregulatory framework of the justice sector to make it more relevant and effective for commerce, \ninvestment, and business in Sri Lanka. The SAP will include recommendations for reform areas, \nsequence of reforms, institutional strengthening, capacity building, law reforms (both substantive \nand procedural), strategic human and other resource planning, automation, and use of information \ntechnology. The SAP will emphasize commercial law, investment, and contract enforcement. \n \n12.  Output 2: One or two reform areas under the SAP supported. Based on the priority \nareas identified under the SAP, the TA will support one or two priority areas of reform. The support \nmay include training and capacity development to improve the skills and knowledge of judges and \nlegal professionals to deal with the commercial and legal regulatory framework of the justice \nsector, specifically on commercial law, investment, and contract enforcement. ADB will discuss \nthe timing and duration of the training and capacity development with the MOJ. \n \n13.  Output 3: Knowledge products developed and disseminated. Output 3 includes the \nproduction  of  the  needs  assessment  study  and  SAP  to  a  publishable  quality,  as  well  as \ndissemination to the public. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $937,500 equivalent, of which $750,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF  6).  The \nGovernment of Sri Lanka will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, local \ncommunications,  office  space  for  consultants,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB, through the Office of the General Counsel (OGC), will administer the TA. The MOJ, \nin coordination with the Judicial Service Commission and the Attorney General\u2019s Department, will \nbe the implementing agency. A steering committee will be established presided by the chief justice \n                                                \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nor his or her nominee, and will consist of (i) the MOJ secretary, (ii) the attorney general or his or \nher representative, (iii) a senior commercial lawyer nominated by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka, \n(iv) the director of the Judges\u2019 Institute, (v) the secretary of the Judicial Service Commission or \nhis or her representative, (vi) the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade \nsecretary or his or her representative, (vii) a representative from the Legal Draftsman Department, \nand (viii) a representative from the private sector. The committee will provide oversight and \nguidance to the TA technical team and facilitate approval of the SAP.8 \n \n16.  OGC will work with ADB\u2019s South Asia Department and Sri Lanka Resident Mission in \nidentifying country needs and demands, as well as implementing TA activities. OGC will be \naccountable for the delivery of TA outputs, including monitoring and evaluation of TA activities. \nThe TA will be implemented from July 2017 to July 2020.
