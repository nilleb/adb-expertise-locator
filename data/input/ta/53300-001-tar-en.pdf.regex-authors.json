INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support regional technical assistance (TA) will promote cooperation \namong policymakers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), and the Republic of Korea (collectively known as ASEAN+3)  in \ndeveloping green local-currency-denominated bonds for infrastructure development in ASEAN+3. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the vision and value addition of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s \n(ADB) Strategy 2030 by promoting green, sustainable, resilient, and inclusive infrastructure \ninvestments.1 The TA is also aligned with the Strategy\u2019s operational priority on fostering regional \ncooperation and integration, particularly by strengthening cooperation in the finance sector and \nstrengthening subregional initiatives.2 In particular, ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 stresses that ADB will \npursue greater collaboration with the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) and the \nCredit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF). The TA is consistent with operational direction \n2  (raising  competitiveness  in  connected  markets)  of  ADB\u2019s  Operational  Plan  for  Regional \nCooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020.3 It facilitates open and dynamic consultation among \nASEAN+3 member countries and stakeholders to ensure broad-based consensus and ownership \nin implementing and managing the ABMI, an initiative launched to promote monetary and financial \ncooperation and integration in ASEAN+3. The TA will be implemented under the guidance of \nASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors as stipulated in the Asian Bond Markets \nInitiative Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  ASEAN+3 governments established the ABMI in 2003 to boost the development of local-\ncurrency bond markets to help mitigate currency and maturity mismatch problems. After the 1997 \nAsian financial crisis, policymakers recognized that more developed bond markets could help the \nregion mobilize local-currency savings to meet long-term investment needs, particularly for \ninfrastructure development. This would have the added benefit of reducing vulnerability to sudden \nreversals of capital inflows, thereby strengthening the financial stability of the region. ASEAN+3 \ngovernments have tasked ADB to serve as the ABMI secretariat. \n \n4.   ASEAN+3 governments have made significant progress in developing local-currency \nbond markets. The aggregated outstanding amount of local-currency bonds issued in ASEAN \nplus the PRC and the Republic of Korea grew from $1.35 trillion in 2003 to $16.00 trillion as of \nDecember 2019. Indonesia and Thailand made concerted efforts to develop local-currency bond \nmarkets by, among other measures, improving public debt management capacity. The Republic \nof Korea and Malaysia have  well-developed bond markets that are balanced between the \ngovernment and corporate segments, with significant depth in both. The PRC is home to the \nASEAN+3\u2019s dominant bond market in terms of size.5 Local-currency bond markets have become \na key source of funding for infrastructure projects in many East Asian emerging economies. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 August 2019. \n3  ADB. 2016. Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020: Promoting Connectivity, \nCompetitiveness, Regional Public Goods, and Collective Action for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n4  ABMI. 2019. ASEAN+3: Asian Bond Markets Initiative Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022. Nadi, Fiji. ASEAN+3 \nfinance ministers and central bank governors endorsed the road map at its 22nd meeting in Nadi, Fiji. \n5  ADB. 2019. Good Practices For Developing A Local Currency Bond Market: Lessons from the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond \nMarkets Initiative. Manila. \n ", "2 \n5.  Building  on  these  achievements,  ASEAN+3  policymakers  are  looking  to  create \necosystems  to  develop  green  local-currency  bonds  to  support  much-needed  infrastructure \ninvestment, taking into account the region\u2019s exposure to a range of climate conditions and \nextreme weather events. ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors endorsed the \nABMI Medium-Term Road Map 2019\u20132022 in May 2019 to guide ABMI activities through 2022, \nincluding an initiative to develop the market of green bonds for infrastructure investment. \n \n6.  Despite increased awareness among bond issuers and investors in ASEAN+3 of the \nimpact of disasters triggered by natural hazards and climate change, most green bonds from \nASEAN+3 issuers are denominated in United States dollars. According to the Climate Bonds \nInitiative, almost 50% of green bonds issued in ASEAN were denominated in United States \ndollars.6 To facilitate green bonds issuance in local currencies, ASEAN+3 policymakers must \naddress several constraints. \n \n7.  The first constraint relates to a lack of supply of green bonds in ASEAN+3 member \ncountries. Understanding of the green bond issuance process and of post-issuance reporting \nrequirements is limited, and there is much uncertainty surrounding which assets and projects \nqualify as green and how green bonds can be structured to ensure compliance with international \nstandards and practices. Many potential issuers see green bonds as more expensive than \nconventional bonds because of the added work involved in ensuring compliance with the green \nbonds framework, tracking the use of proceeds, and conducting post-issuance reporting. Securing \nan external review and certification for green bonds is also costly. Administrative costs can range \nfrom $29,000 to $117,000 for pre-issuance through ongoing reporting, assuming that the net \nproceeds of the green bonds are fully deployed after 1 year.7 Such costs can seem excessive \nfrom an issuers\u2019 point of view. \n \n8.  The second constraint relates to the lack of demand for green bonds from investors in \nASEAN+3 member countries. International investors that consider environmental, social, and \ngovernance factors in their investment decisions are not familiar with potential issuers of green \nbonds, particularly those from ASEAN, making such bonds less attractive to these investors. \nFurthermore, demand for green bonds by domestic investors in ASEAN+3 countries remains \nbelow average because such investors tend to focus strictly on economic returns, while paying \nlittle heed to the \u201cgreenness\u201d of their investments. Investors, particularly fund managers, are often \nof the view that they will sacrifice basis points if they invest in green bonds, and worry that their \nfunds will be less competitive. Meanwhile, investors may face reputational risks if their supposedly \ngreen investments turn out not to be green or lose their green status. They also face extra costs \nrelated to acquiring reliable data and information on the environmental impact of the green bonds \nthey target. \n \n9.  The TA is designed to support the creation of ecosystems to develop green local-currency \nfinancing in ASEAN+3 based on the assessment and recommendations of the Promoting Green \nLocal Currency Bonds for Infrastructure Development in ASEAN+3 study, which was submitted \nto and welcomed by the ASEAN+3 finance ministers and central bank governors at their 21st \nmeeting in May 2018 in Manila, Philippines. The TA activities will be synchronized with regional \ninitiatives such as the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF),8 the ASEAN Working Committee \n \n6   Climate Bonds Initiative. 2019. ASEAN Green Finance State of the Market. London. \n7  ADB. 2018. Promoting Green Local Currency Bonds for Infrastructure Development in ASEAN+3. Manila. The \nPeople's Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund supported the publication. \n8  The ACMF is a forum comprising capital market regulators from 10 ASEAN jurisdictions: Brunei Darussalam, \nCambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, \n \n ", "3 \non Capital Market Development (WC-CMD),9 the Technical Assistance Coordination Team under \nthe ABMI,10 the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Financial Regulators Training Initiative,11 and \nthe ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility under the ASEAN Infrastructure Fund. It is important \nto note that the Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division of ADB\u2019s Southeast \nAsia Department is providing TA to the ACMF to support discussion among ASEAN securities \nregulators and to promote ACMF activities to international investing communities.12 The TA will \nfocus on supporting potential green bond issuers to issue green bonds under international and \nregional standards, including the ASEAN green bond standards introduced by the ACMF. The TA \nwill also take into consideration activities under the ACMF Roadmap for ASEAN Sustainable \nCapital Markets, as well as the WC-CMD Sustainable Finance Roadmap. The ACMF and WC-\nCMD will propose their respective roadmaps to the ASEAN finance ministers for endorsement in \nMarch 2020. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: financial stability and support for infrastructure \nfinance deepened.13 The TA will have the following outcome: issuance of green local-currency-\ndenominated bonds for infrastructure finance increased.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The  TA  consists  of  two  outputs  designed  to  address  constraints  associated  with \ndeveloping  green  bonds  in  ASEAN+3:  (i)  regional  facility  to  support  green  bond  issuance \nestablished, and (ii) demand for green bonds promoted. \n \n12.  Output 1: Regional facility to support green bond issuance established. The TA will \nestablish a regional facility to support corporate bond issuers in bringing green bonds to market. \nThe facility will address binding constraints (which vary from country to country) to issuing green \nbonds, including a lack of market awareness, additional costs associated with issuing green \nbonds, and a lack of understanding about eligible projects and underlying assets. The facility will \npartner industry experts such as the Private Sector Operations Department of ADB, the CGIF, \nthe Climate Bonds Initiative, the International Capital Market Association, securities regulators, \nstock  exchanges,  bond  market  associations,  and  rating  agencies  in  ASEAN+3  to  address \nimpediments and challenges. This output will contribute to creating a conducive environment for \ndeveloping green bond markets in ASEAN+3, paving the way for the establishment of regional \n \nThailand, and Viet Nam. Established in 2004 under the auspices of the ASEAN finance ministers, the ACMF initially \nfocused on harmonization of rules and regulations before shifting toward more strategic issues to achieve greater \nintegration of the region\u2019s capital markets under the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint 2025. \n9  WC-CMD, formed under the ASEAN Finance Cooperation Process, focuses on developing, interlinking, and \ndeepening ASEAN\u2019s capital markets by building capacity and laying the long-term infrastructure to achieve \nintegration of capital markets in the region. \n10 The Technical Assistance and Coordination Team under the ABMI was established to provide support to individual \nASEAN member countries (based on their individual requirements) to promote bond market development through \nTA projects. \n11 The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) finance ministers established the APEC Financial Regulators \nTraining Initiative in May 1998 to strengthen financial supervision and regulation in Asia and the Pacific by enhancing \nthe analytical and technical capacity of bank supervisors and securities regulators. \n12 ADB. 2019.

Nadi, Fiji. \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nmarket practices with regards to green bond issuance processes. The facility, with support from \nindustry experts, will also (i) help potential issuers and underwriters lower issuance costs by \nguiding them through (a) the process of issuing green bonds under the Climate Bond Standards, \nGreen Bond Principles, and ASEAN Green Bond Standards; and (b) post-issuance reporting \nrequirements, including managing the use of proceeds; and (ii) in certain cases, support issuers \nto partially offset the higher costs of green bonds issuance and other associated costs. The facility \nwill also explore the feasibility of enhancing the capacity of service providers such as ratings \nagencies and guarantee companies to provide advice and external review services to green bond \nissuers in ASEAN+3. \n \n13.  Output 2: Demand for green bonds promoted. The TA team will partner with the \nAsianBondsOnline (ABO) team to (i) create a regional green bond information platform on the \nABO website, (ii) disseminate information on green bond market developments in ASEAN+3 \nthrough the ABO, and (iii) increase investors\u2019 awareness of the latest advances in regional green \nbond markets through the ABO. The TA will continue to explore the feasibility of establishing an \nASEAN+3 green bonds exchange-traded fund and an ASEAN+3 green bonds index to help fund \nmanagers construct investment products to facilitate intra-regional investment. Through the TA, \nASEAN+3 initiatives will be linked with relevant regional initiatives such as the ACMF and the \nWC-CMD to promote ASEAN green-bonds standards to investors in ASEAN+3 member countries \nand facilitate intra-regional investment.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund and administered \nby ADB.15 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. Staff at the Office of the Chief Economist and the Director \nGeneral of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will play leading roles \nin the implementation of this TA, and ADB staff will also serve as resource persons in consultative \ndiscussions with ASEAN+3 member countries, with mission costs to be financed by the TA. The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  March 2020\u2013February 2022 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nImplementing agency  The Office of the Chief Economist and Director General of ADB\u2019s \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department will \nimplement the technical assistance (TA) in close coordination with \nADB\u2019s Southeast Asia Department (particularly the Public \nManagement, Financial Sector, and Trade Division); East Asia \nDepartment (particularly the Public Management, Financial Sector, \nand Regional Cooperation Division); and Private Sector Operations \nDepartment. The Finance Sector Group of the Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department will be consulted \nthroughout the implementation period. \n \n15 The fund was originally named \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d in \nthe 2005 Board paper. \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nConsultantsa  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  International expertise  $199,800 \n(10 person-months, \nintermittent) \nIndividual selection  National expertise  $56,600 \n(16 person-months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \na  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16.
