The Government of the Fiji Islands (the Government) has requested support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for a technical assistance (TA) to prepare a civil aviation and \nairports improvement project.  \n \n2.  Fact-finding for the TA was conducted in December 2002. The Fact-Finding Mission \nreached understandings with the Government and its agencies; Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji \nIslands (CAAFI); and Airports Fiji, Limited (AFL) on the TA objectives, scope, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the consultant services. \nThese are recorded in a memorandum of understanding. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2003 \ncountry strategy and program update for the Fiji Islands.1 This TA report was prepared based on \nthe Mission's observations in the field and discussions with the Government and its agencies. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Transport in the Fiji Islands is well developed and consists of road, maritime, rail, and air \nmodes of transport. The gateway international airport is at Nadi, with regional air traffic handled \nby the Nausori airport near Suva. Domestic aviation infrastructure includes 18 airports.  \n \n4.  The Fiji Islands\u2019 economy relies primarily on tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing. \nTourism is the primary source of growth and export income earnings. About 496,000 people \nvisited the Fiji Islands in 2001, with 85% of these tourists, 5% business visitors, and the rest \nrelated to education and family visits. Visits to the Fiji Islands have grown by an annual average \nof 9% since 1961, and 5% since 1990. While the visits declined considerably in consequence of \nthe two coups d\u2019etat, in 1987 and 2000, the long-term annual visitor growth has remained at 5% \nfor the past decade. Tourism also contributes about 20% to employment (or about 40,000 jobs) \nand 17% of gross domestic product (GDP), more than any other single industry. Over the years, \nthe receipts from tourism have helped to reduce the impact of the trade deficits, contributing \nthus to the positive current account positions and stability of the local currency.  \n \n5.  In its Strategic Development Plan (2003\u20132005) and 20\u2013year Development Plan (2001\u2013\n2020), the Government consistently emphasizes its proactive approach to increasing tourism \nincome through programs that support tourism development, including (i) implementing the \ncurrent Tourism Development Plan 1998\u20132005; (ii) establishing new training facilities for tourism \nservices; (iii) supporting private investments in the sector; and (iv) most importantly, attracting \nadditional flights to new and existing markets. These documents emphasize the impact of \ntourism on poverty reduction through micro-business and employment.  \n \n6.  The transport infrastructure and management, particularly the aviation facilities, are \ncrucial for the Fiji Islands\u2019 competitiveness as a tourist destination. Tourism is forecast to drive \nGDP growth under the Government\u2019s medium-term development scenario, with tourist arrivals \nexpected to exceed 500,000 in 2003 and double by the end of the decade. Through the \nsecondary  tourism  activities,  the  Government  has  concluded  that  improvement  in  tourism \ncatalyzes far-reaching positive impacts that are crucial for poverty reduction and improvement of \nwelfare in the Fiji Islands.  \n \n7.  The Government, however, has recognized that aviation facilities, particularly the airport \ninfrastructure, constrains the development  of tourism. Nadi International Airport, capable of \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in Asian Development Bank Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 17 December 2002. ", "2 \nhandling  747s,  is  an  international  gateway  to  the  Fiji  Islands.  Nausori  airport\u2014a  second \ninternational entry point and critical for domestic and regional traffic\u2014is capable of handling \n737s. The national carrier, Air Pacific, Qantas, Air New Zealand, and Korean Airlines land at \nNadi airport, with domestic air services provided by Air Fiji and Sunflower Airlines. These \nairlines are planning aircraft upgrades in response to their business growth. Aircraft movements \nin Nadi numbered 42,282 in 1999, with 54% domestic; 19% international; and 27% private, \nmilitary, freight, and training flights. The cargo traffic amounted to 20,000 tons in 2000. In 2002, \n1.2  million  passengers  transited  through  the  Nadi  airport;  85% of them were international \npassengers. While the passenger traffic and cargo handled at Nadi airport declined as a result \nof the political events of May 2000, passenger arrivals bounced back in 2001 and 2002. The \nStrategic Development Plan provides a policy framework for upgrading the aviation and airport \nsector infrastructure and management to meet international standards and practices.  \n \n8.  The 2002 masterplan for Nadi airport forecast the long-term (20 year) increase of the \ninternational and  domestic passenger at 5% and 3% per annum, respectively. The forecast \ncorrelates growth in air cargoes with the national GDP, and these are projected to grow by 3.5% \nper annum. The international aircraft movements are forecast to grow by 7% per annum. \nAustralia, New Zealand, and United States continue to be the main origins of passenger traffic \nto  the  Fiji  Islands,  and  the  demand  for  airport  services  relies  on  developments  in  these \neconomies. The Nausori airport handled 190,000 domestic passengers in 2002,  and this is \nforecast to grow by 4% per annum. Nausori airport also serviced a small number (24,000) of \ninternational passengers.  \n \n9.  The airport terminals at Nadi and Nausori were built in the 1960s and are having \ndifficulties  handling  the  current  aircraft  traffic.  The  facilities  do  not  provide  services  at \ninternational standards. Space required for airport operations at Nadi and Nausori airports \nexceeds that available; by 2009, 53% more space will be required at Nadi and 131% at Nausori \nairports. In addition to the forecast air traffic growth, both airports could increase their income \nfrom retail businesses, which would increase employment and contribute to poverty reduction. \nThe Fiji Islands National Transport Plan and its 2001 review and policy update detail the need to \nexamine the condition of the current airport facilities including the adequacy of the international \nand domestic runways, ground handling facilities, air terminals, and sector organization. The \naviation industry has expressed the need to assess the runway conditions.  \n \n10.  The Fiji Islands has 16 domestic public and 2 privately owned airports. The public \nairports have been maintained only on an ad hoc basis. The facilities cannot serve high-end or \nhigh volume traffic. Funding for maintenance is insufficient and has not been disbursed in full. \nIncreased user charges and community engagement in the maintenance could help improve the \nmaintenance conditions. As a part of the TA, the Government will assess (i) domestic airport \nconditions; (ii) traffic and demand forecasts; (iii) contracting arrangements for air services and \nfor infrastructure maintenance; (iv) the regulatory framework for the domestic aviation, cost \nrecovery, and landing charges; and (v) effective strategies for providing remote air transport.  \n \n11.  In April 1999, self-funding airport operations of the Government\u2019s statutory authority, the \nCivil Aviation Authority of Fiji, were reorganized into operational functions of Airports Fiji, Limited \n(AFL).2 AFL was established as a state-owned commercial entity with merit- and market-based \npersonnel  policies  and  powers  to  propose,  set,  and  collect  fees.  AFL  reports  on  the \nachievement of its performance indicators to the Ministry of Finance and Planning and the \nMinistry of Public Enterprises (MPE), representing the government shareholding. The civil \n                                                 \n2 Reorganization Charter approved in February 1998 under Public Enterprise Act 1995. ", "    3 \nauthority\u2019s regulatory functions were allocated to the new Civil Aviation Authority of Fiji Islands \n(CAAFI). The Government\u2019s obligations under international aviation conventions remained a \nresponsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation (MOTCA). Additionally, the Airport \nTerminal Services, 51% owned by CAAFI and 49% by the employers, provides ground handling \nservices at the Nadi airport.  \n \n12.  MOTCA is responsible for the legal framework of the sector, traffic rights, conventions, \nand treaties including relations with international agencies. CAAFI became responsible for \npersonnel, operator certification and licensing, aircraft airworthiness certification, and meeting \nthe Fiji Islands\u2019 obligations under international aviation conventions. AFL is licensed by the \nGovernment3 to (i) manage air traffic services in the Fiji Islands\u2019 flight information region; (ii) \noperate, maintain, and manage the 16 public airports, including the 2 international airports; and \n(iii) control the other revenue-generating activities associated with the airports. AFL represents \nthe Government\u2019s ownership of the public airport assets, and is a fully state-owned entity. AFL \noperates Nadi and Nausori airports on a commercial basis, with a cross-subsidy from Nadi to \nNausori operations. AFL receives a grant of F$0.48 million (US$0.24 million) from the fiscal \nbudget  for  the  management  of  other  domestic  airports  to  supplement  the  domestic  cost \nrecovery  revenues.  These  funds  are,  however,  insufficient  for  adequate  maintenance  and \nmanagement of these airfields and terminals. As a result, domestic airport operations do not \nreceive inadequate attention. Significant improvement in the management of the sector requires \ncompletion of the reforms, including improvement of financial management of domestic aviation \nand the related subsidies, maximization of benefits from potential outsourcing and privatization, \nand reallocation of responsibilities among the sector agencies.   \n \n13.  In light of the tourism and civil aviation forecasts, a long-term development plan is \nrequired to support the planned investments. The plan is to (i) validate demand forecasts and \nprioritize the proposed investments; (ii) determine tariffs; (iii) establish institutional and human \nresources; (iv) outline a regulatory framework and industry conditions; (v) prepare least-cost \nfinancing packages for the investments; and (vi) determine policies for privatizing the national \nairline (Air Pacific), maximizing air services, and improving air safety.  \n \n14.  The ensuing Project is envisaged to (i) increase capacity of the airports enabling landing \nof B747-400s in Nadi and 737-800s in Nausori,  (ii) upgrade air terminals, (iii) upgrade aircraft \nservice facilities and navigation aids, (iv) upgrade space for airport businesses, (v) improve \ndomestic airports, and (v) implement reforms. The improvements in airport facilities, including \nrunways, terminal buildings, and navigation aids, will enhance access of international travelers \nto the Fiji Islands and its domestic destinations, and thus generate income for the rural poor. \nImprovements  for  airport  businesses  will  generate  employment  and  contribute  to  poverty \nreduction. Improving the efficiency of airport services through reforms will reduce the cost of \ntravel, enable the rural population to have access to the mainstream markets, and reduce \nurbanization. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n15.  The TA will prepare a feasibility study for upgrading the airports and civil aviation in the \nFiji Islands. The TA will (i) assess the demand for air transport; (ii) prepare a program for \ninvestments; (iii) identify a policy framework to improve the effectiveness of aviation operations; \n                                                 \n3 Companies Act 1983. ", "4 \n(iv) identify least cost technical solutions for the proposed investments and financing, including \nan assessment of the use of ADB\u2019s credit enhancement schemes; and (v) for the management \nof the domestic airports, identify solutions that target reducing poverty and increasing private \nsector involvement.  A framework for the TA is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA methodology will employ inclusive and consensus-building methods through \nworkshops, stakeholder consultations, and public presentations. Key activities of the TA are \n(i) evaluating demand for, and benefits and beneficiaries of, improved airport and civil aviation \ninfrastructure, facilities, and management; (ii) preparing a long-term development program that \nprioritizes investment; (iii) identifying domestic and external financing possibilities; (iv) preparing  \nproject implementation arrangements; (v) recommending competitive tariffs and regulations, \nincluding a competitive regime of air services agreements, (vi) establishing a pragmatic program \nfor implementing institutional and policy reforms; (vii) evaluating the financial and economic \nviability  of  the  proposed  investments  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  Economic \nAnalysis of Projects; and (viii) assessing the social and environmental impacts of the proposed \ninvestments as required for category A projects under ADB\u2019s Environment Policy, Guidelines for \nIncorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Bank  Operations  and  Environmental  Guidelines  for \nSelected Infrastructure Projects, and in accordance with regulations of the Government.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,009,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange component is $666,600 and the local currency component is $342,400 equivalent. \nThe Government has requested ADB to finance $710,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign \nexchange cost and $43,400 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed by \nthe ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of this TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  Detailed \ncost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  A total of 25 person-months of international consultant services are required from an \ninternational firm in the fields of airport economics; aviation engineering; corporate and project \nfinance; institutional development and the International Civil Aviation Organization guidelines; \nand financial, economic, social, poverty, and environmental analysis. The consulting services \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB's  Guidelines on the Use of  Consultants using the \nquality- plus cost-based selection. The outline terms of reference for the consultant services are \nin Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  Executing Agency. AFL will be the Executing Agency for the TA with MOTCA. The \nMinistry  of  Finance,  Planning,  and  Telecommunications  (MOFPT)  and  CAAFI  will  closely \noversee the TA. AFL will coordinate the TA activities with all stakeholders, including MPE, the \naviation  industry,  and  the  communities,  and  will  ensure  that  the  consultations  with  these \nstakeholder groups are inclusive and substantive. AFL will assist with data gathering during TA \nimplementation, and will be responsible for attaining the necessary government approvals. A \nsteering  committee  comprising  the  heads  of  MOTCA,  MOFPT,  CAAFI,  MPE,  and \nrepresentatives of air transport provides and users will be established to guide the TA.  \n ", "    5 \n20.  Deliverables. The TA will be implemented during 6 months commencing in June 2003 \nand ending in January 2004. The consultants will submit inception, monthly progress, draft final, \nand  final  reports.  The  consultants  will  organize  a  minimum  of  three  meetings  between \nGovernment, the consultants, and ADB. The meetings will review the consultants\u2019 reports and \nproposals. The consultants will also convene coordination meetings with funding agencies in \nconnection  with  the  three  scheduled  meetings.  The  consultant  will  organize  stakeholder \nworkshops to develop consensus on the proposed investments and reform programs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$710,000 on a grant basis \nto the Government of the Fiji Islands for preparing the Civil Aviation and Airports Improvement \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
