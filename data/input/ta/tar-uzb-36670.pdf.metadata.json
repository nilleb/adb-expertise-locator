The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  in  association  with  European  Bank  for \nReconstruction  and  Development  (EBRD)  and  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  is \nsupporting  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  and  Uzbek  Telecom  (UT)  to  strengthen  the \ntelecommunications  regulatory  environment,  while  identifying  opportunities  to  improve  the \nprofitability of UT in preparation for privatization. In early August 2002, a joint mission of ADB, \nIFC,  and  EBRD  agreed  to  collaborate  to  provide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  assist  UT \nrestructure its operations along commercial lines. This understanding has been confirmed with \nthe Government in a letter jointly issued by EBRD, IFC, and ADB on 8 November 2002. Subject \nto the findings of the TA, the international financial institutions (IFIs) may consider the provision \nof a preprivatization loan (PPL) to help facilitate the privatization of the UT\u2019s operations. As per \nthe understanding reached, EBRD will provide support to review the regulatory framework of \nUT,  IFC  will  help  develop  a  business  plan,  and  ADB  will  support  the  development  of  a \nmanagement information system (MIS) for UT. ADB\u2019s proposed TA will help UT develop cost-\nbased tariffs and enable accurate monitoring of financial performance against business plan \nprojections. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Reform of Large Utilities. In line with the broader macroeconomic stabilization program \nand structural reforms, the Government  is undertaking preparatory work to restructure large \nutilities  in  the  telecommunications,  oil  and  gas,  and  power  sectors  to  remove  critical \ninfrastructure  bottlenecks,  reduce  production  costs  by  pursuing  industrial  deregulation  to \nincrease the level of competition, and improve the ability of large utilities to access capital and \nskills  through  privatization.  The  State  Property  Committee  (GKI),  in  association  with  the \nPrivatization Bureau, has been implementing case-by-case privatization, financed by a World \nBank Loan. As part of this program, GKI has launched reforms in the telecommunications sector \nwhere  domestic  and  international  operations  have  been  merged  to  create  UT,  and  a \nprivatization advisor, Commerzbank, has been engaged to advise on restructuring with a view to \npreparing UT for eventual privatization. In the natural resources sector, the Government has \ndecided to privatize the national oil and gas company, UzbekNefteGaz. In the power sector, GKI \nis recruiting a consultant for Uzbek Energo to advise on industry restructuring, regulation, and \nprivatization options. In the rail sector, GKI is assessing the privatization potential of a number \nof companies. \n \n3.  Telecommunications Sector.  The fixed telecommunications network suffers from very \nlow coverage because of years of underinvestment. In Uzbekistan, currently, penetration rate of \nabout 6.5 telephone lines for every 100 inhabitants is low (compared with Russia where the \npenetration rate is 21%) and has not risen over the years. In contrast supported by enhanced \ncompetition, the mobile sector has seen considerable growth. Despite this, the present six \nmobile operators have managed to achieve a national penetration rate of only about  0.4%, \nwhich is still lower than that of Russia (2.3%). \n \n4.  The telecommunications sector policy and regulatory framework has been the subject of \na detailed review funded by the Technical Assistance Program for the Commonwealth of \nIndependent States (TACIS). On the basis of the review, the Government has unbundled the \nsector somewhat by separating policy and regulatory functions from service provision. Under \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 4 December 2002. ", "2 \nthe present arrangement, since July 2000 the Communications and Information Agency of \nUzbekistan (CIAU) now handles the policy and regulatory functions, while UT provides for fixed \nline services. UT was subsequently corporatized and its ownership now rests fully with GKI.   \n \n5.  The Government has promulgated the new telecommunications law and developed a \nconceptual framework to introduce fundamental principles of competition and modern regulation \nin the telecommunications sector. UT has a market share of 98% in the local fixed line and 95% \nin the long-distance fixed-line subsector. The privatization advisor, Commerzbank, has been \nappointed to facilitate the divestiture of UT. The Government plans to sell 51\u201375% of UT's \nshares  to  a  strategic  shareholder.  Commerzbank  has  advised  on,  and  supervised  further \nrestructuring of UT's operations by  merging UT\u2019s 12 regional operating companies. UT has \ninvested heavily in the national network, with 8 of 12 regional centers already being connected \nby fiber optic cable. It is expected that the other four centers, which were connected by radio-\nrelay lines, will be connected with the general network by fiber optic lines by 2003. \n \n6.  Despite  the  progress  of  structural  reforms  in  the  telecommunications  sector,  the \nGovernment  has  yet  to  develop  an  independent  regulator  and  draw  up  a  timetable  for \nintroducing competition in basic telecommunications services. The tariff structure of UT needs to \nbe revised to reflect the actual costs of provision. The UT enterprise-restructuring program \nbegan on 27 December 2001 following the Decision of the Cabinet of Ministers #488. At the \nsame time, further work is required to transform UT into a commercially viable company. There \nis significant under capacity in some areas of the fixed-line network. For instance, in October \n2000 Commerzbank estimated there was a waiting list of 33,577 people.2  At the same time, \nthere is significant excess capacity in the national network due to low levels of digitized access \nlines that would allow data communication services.   \n \n7.  UT's financial statements for 2001 and for the first half of 2002 have been revised in line \nwith International Accounting Standards (IAS). The latest accounts indicate that despite stable \ngrowth of revenue in national currency, the revenue of UT in US dollars decreased over the last \nyears  because  the  growth  of  tariffs  lagged  behind  the  growth  of  the  US  dollar  rate. \nConsequently, UT has accumulated a substantial level of debt (close to $170 million), which is \nbeyond its debt servicing capacity in relation to its revenues and cash flows. This debt burden, \ncoupled with the weak financial performance of UT, makes it difficult for the IFIs to consider at \nthis time a PPL that would help attract strong strategic partners to UT in the future. To enable \nthe IFIs and any strategic investor to consider this PPL, UT will need to substantially improve its \nperformance and transform itself into a commercially viable and attractive investment candidate.  \n \n8.  To support this approach, the Government and the aid agencies have developed an \nintegrated program of TA to develop a PPL to support restructuring UT. The proposed TA \nprogram will build on the work done by TACIS during 1999-2001 to modernize and liberalize the \ntelecommunications sector and prepare for the proposed privatization of UT.  EBRD\u2019s TA will \nassist UT carry through the proposed regulatory reforms needed to remove conflicts of interest \nin regulation, and provide the basis for allowing UT to charge efficient commercially sustainable \ntariffs. A further requirement for establishing UT as a commercially viable entity is a business \nplan, and IFC will finance this activity. Underpinning both the upgrading of the regulatory \nframework and the successful implementation of the business plan is a fully automated MIS \nbased on IAS, and this initiative is the focus of the proposed TA.  The work done in this TA will \nbe closely coordinated with reforms supported by ADB in the areas of corporate governance \nand enterprise restructuring. \n                                                 \n2 Information Memorandum prepared by Commerzbank. ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will provide  UT with a modern MIS based on an IAS accounting system that \nwould allow it to (i) improve understanding of its cost structure and key profitability drivers; \n(ii) derive cost-based tariffs, which in turn will help the telecommunications regulatory body \nestablish an appropriate tariff framework for the sector; (iii) monitor its budgeted versus actual \nfinancial performance; and (iv) make appropriate operational and strategic business decisions.      \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The  TA  will  be  in  four stages: stage 1\u2013development of the accounting, budgeting, \ninvestment  planning,  and  reporting  framework;  stage  2\u2013detailed  design  of  accounting, \nbudgeting, investment planning, and reporting procedures; stage 3\u2013development of customized \naccounting and MIS designed to accommodate the framework and procedures; and stage 4\u2013\npreparation and implementation of a training program for management and staff. \n \n11.  The TA will include the following activities:   \n \n(i)  Conduct interviews with senior management, prepare  a  preliminary  business \ndiagnosis of UT, identify existing accounting system and MIS and procedures, \nand  specify  the  conceptual  parameters  of  the  accounting  and  management \nreporting  system  that  will  be  implemented\u2014the accounting, budgeting, and \ninvestment  planning  concept  will  define  the  principles  of  the  accounting, \nbudgeting,  investment  planning,  and  reporting  process,  the  distribution  of \nresponsibilities in the planning and reporting process (vertical and horizontal); \nidentify the accounting, budgeting,  and investment decision-making principals; \nidentify the statutory accounting and management information needs; and outline \nbasic planning, management, and accounting reporting forms. \n \n(ii)  Develop a system of key performance indicators (KPIs) and normative standards \nthat underpin the critical revenue, cost, and profitability drivers for planning, \ncontrol, and benchmarking of the revenue and costs of various business levels of \nthe organization. Detailed planning and reporting forms and procedures based on \nIAS will be developed to coordinate the accounting, budgeting, and reporting \nprocess to provide a basis for subsequent timely and effective evaluation of \ncommercial  performance  by  management  and  shareholders;  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of each of the involved parties in the management reporting \nprocess will be formally identified and agreed-upon. \n \n(iii)  Develop a computerized accounting system and MIS that will provide UT with the \ncapability  to  operationalize  the  budget,  investment,  and  reporting  framework \ndeveloped in stage 2. Specifically, the MIS will provide KPIs and planning and \nreporting forms for budgeting units and each responsibility and analytical center \nwithin UT, supported by a manual for using the MIS; the system will be tested \nwith UT staff. \n \n(iv)  Prepare and implement appropriate training programs for management and staff. \nThe training program will provide management and staff with the necessary skills ", "4 \nand  information  needed  to  implement  the  accounting,  budgeting,  investment \nplanning, and reporting framework and procedures using the computerized MIS. \n \n(v)  Based on (i) to (iv) above, formulate selected components of the PPL that will \nguide the commercial restructuring of UT. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $600,000 equivalent, comprising $375,000 in \nforeign exchange and $225,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to provide the entire foreign exchange cost and $25,000 equivalent in local currency. The \nGovernment will provide $200,000 equivalent in counterpart facilities. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program.  Details of the cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  UT will be the Executing Agency for the TA.  The TA activities will be closely coordinated \nwith  the  TA  being  provided  by  EBRD  in  telecommunications  regulation,  and  by  IFC  in \ndeveloping the business plan for UT.   \n \n14.  ADB will select and engage a firm using the quality\u2013and cost\u2013based selection method \nand a simplified technical proposal in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. Consulting services \nof 16 persons\u2013months will be required: 8 international and 8 domestic. The consultant team will \ncomprise three international consultants and two domestic consultants, with relevant experience \nin developing accounting systems and MIS based on IAS in the region. Appendix 3 gives the \noutline terms of reference for the consultants.  \n \n15.  The TA is expected to begin in March 2003 and will be implemented over a period of \n8 months, finishing in June 2004. Activities in stage 1 will take 1.5 months and involve a series \nof preliminary meetings between the consultants and UT management so they can explain the \nwork program. The business diagnostic will then be prepared and will be used to develop the \naccounting, budgeting, and investment-planning concept. An inception report will be submitted \n2 weeks after project inception, and an interim report defining the business concept will be \nsubmitted 1.5 months after project inception. The findings of the business concept will be \ndiscussed and agreed-upon with UT's management team and the IFIs. Stage 2 will take \n2 months, and the key output will  be  a second interim report detailing the design of the \naccounting, budgeting, investment-planning, and reporting procedures for UT. Stage 3 will take \n2 months to implement, and the outputs will be a third interim report, accompanied by a \ncomputerized accounting system and MIS, and a manual that reflects the business concept \nprepared in stage 2. Stage 4 will take 2 weeks; during this time, the consultants will submit an \nagreed-upon training program to UT's management and staff, and present a draft final report \nthat will be finalized following the approval of UT management and the IFIs. \n \nIV.
