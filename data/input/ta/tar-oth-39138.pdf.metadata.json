L. Wang (team leader) and N. G. Amorado.", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (ASOSAI)1 is a regional working \ngroup of the International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI).2 The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has provided nine regional technical assistance (TA) grants to both \nASOSAI and the South Pacific Association of Supreme Audit Institutions (SPASAI) since 1989.3 \nProviding TAs to ASOSAI and SPASAI has proven beneficial to ADB developing member \ncountries (DMCs), since the majority of the DMCs are ASOSAI or SPASAI members. ADB\u2019s \nTAs have helped the supreme audit institutions (SAIs) within the DMCs strengthen their auditing \nand training capabilities. Such strengthening is essential for promoting financial accountability \nand good governance in the public sector of the region. \n \n2.  After ADB\u2019s first TA in 1990,4 ASOSAI was able to start training activities using its own \nfunds in 1992 and trainers from host SAIs. After the second and third TA,5 ASOSAI created a \ntraining infrastructure, including its own pool of regional trainers recruited from its member SAIs. \nThe fourth TA6 expanded ASOSAI\u2019s pool of trainers and enabled it to conduct more training \ncourses using its own funds, trainers, and training material. On its own, ASOSAI has completed \n15 training workshops so far. Post-TA activities show that a number of SAIs were able to \nconduct similar audit training in their respective countries applying INTOSAI auditing standards. \nThe success of previous TAs was attributed to the strong sense of ownership and commitment \nof INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI),7 ASOSAI, and member SAIs. The participative and \nconsultative  processes  throughout  the  TA  planning  and  implementation  period  encouraged \nregional  cooperation  and  collaboration  among  the  SAIs.  The  use  of  the  latest  information \ntechnology  facilitated  consultation  and  information-sharing  among  the  training  specialists, \nenabling them to collectively design and develop a course without leaving their respective \noffices. Taken together, these factors also contributed to the sustainability of the TAs.8  \n \n3.  To further strengthen SAI\u2019s audit capability and training programs, ASOSAI, through its \ntraining administrator\u2014the Board of Audit of Japan (BAJ)\u2014approached ADB in 2004 to initiate a \npossible fifth TA in 2005.  After discussions, ADB, BAJ, and IDI agreed in principle on the TA\u2019s \nimpact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements. \nSee Appendix 1 for the TA design and monitoring framework. The Office of the Auditor General \nsubmitted  the  concept  paper  to  the  Vice-President  (Knowledge  and  Management  and \n                                                 \n1 Established in 1979, the primary missions of ASOSAI are to promote understanding and cooperation among \nmember institutions, provide facilities for training and continuing education for government auditors, serve as a \nregional link in the field of public audit, and promote closer collaboration and brotherhood among auditors in the \ngovernment services among member institutions. \n2 INTOSAI, established in 1953, is the professional organization of SAIs in countries that belong to the United Nations \nor its specialized agencies.  \n3  Five TAs were provided to SPASAI from August 1989 to June 2002 and four TAs to ASOSAI from June 1990 to \nDecember 2001. \n4 ADB. 1990. Technical Assistance for ASOSAI Audit Training Program, Manila (TA 5386-REG, for $446,000, \napproved on 1 June 1990). \n5  ADB. 1996. Technical Assistance for Regional Long-Term Audit Training Program for Members of ASOSAI. Manila \n(TA 5688-REG, for $1,000,000, approved on 13 June 1996). \n   ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance for Regional Long-term Audit Training Program for Members of ASOSAI (Phase \nII). Manila (TA 5872-REG, for $300,000, approved on 3 December 1999). \n6  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Strengthening the Regional Training Capability of the ASOSAI. Manila (TA \n6014-REG, for $650,000, approved on 18 December 2001). \n7  The INTOSAI Development Initiative (IDI) was established in 1986 as the training arm of INTOSAI. IDI's mission is \nto help SAIs, especially in developing and emerging nations, to improve their audit capacity and resolve audit \nissues through training and information sharing. \n8  Major lessons learned are noted in available TA Completion Reports as indicated in footnotes 5 and 6. \n ", "2  \nSustainable  Development)  on  4  February  2005  with  a  copy  to  the  Strategy  and  Policy \nDepartment. The President subsequently approved the concept paper on 30 March 2005. 9\n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Since ASOSAI's establishment in 1979, its membership has grown from 11 to 43 SAIs \nas of 30 March 2005. Of the 43 SAIs, 27 are from ADB member countries, of which 22 are \nDMCs (Appendix 2). \n \n5.  Bridging the Gap in Audit Capability. In earlier workshops held by ASOSAI, the \ntraining subjects were selected to accommodate as many SAI members as possible. Each SAI \nwas given equal opportunity to participate in the training program. While the workshops have \ncontributed to improving audit capability in the region, the feedback was that some topics were \ntoo advanced for the less experienced SAIs (targeted SAIs).10 As more SAIs are expected to \njoin ASOSAI, the gap in auditing capability between the targeted SAIs and the more advanced \nSAIs will widen.11 The situation of the targeted SAIs lagging behind in audit capability is fast \nbecoming a problem for ASOSAI. Inadequate financial resources for training the targeted SAIs \nworsen the audit capability gap.  \n \n6.   BAJ surveyed ASOSAI members12 in July 2004 to obtain feedback on the success and \nlessons learned from previous TAs.The survey was to help ensure that the design of this TA \nconsider SAI concerns.  Through the survey, ASOSAI members also expressed the need for \nassisting the targeted SAIs to bridge the audit capacity gap. \n  \n7.  Minimizing the audit capability gap between SAIs in the region will enable all ASOSAI \nmembers to benefit equally from advanced audit courses and to cope better with emerging \nissues, such as strengthening public sector management and promoting anticorruption efforts in \ntheir respective countries. \n \n8.  Multilingual Course Materials. Another concern raised by ASOSAI members is their \ndifficulty in using course materials currently prepared in English. A complete set of course \nmaterial consists of instructor\u2019s guide, participant\u2019s notes, presentation slides, exercises and \ncase studies, and suggested solutions. Translating the course materials into local languages will \nenable the SAIs to fully use them for in-house training programs. Having multilingual course \nmaterials will further enhance the sustainability of the TA and enable the SAIs to train more \nauditors in their countries.  \n \n9.  Link to ADB Strategy.  Assisting SAIs to enhance public accountability is in line with \nADB's governance policy13 and anticorruption policy.14  The TA will promote good governance \n                                                 \n9  This TA does not require consultants, thus the Auditor General approved the waiver for the ADB Business \nOpportunities Listing Requirement pursuant to Project Administration Instructions No. 2.02, Section D, para. 4. \n10 The targeted SAIs need more assistance, have less auditing experience, and were more recently established. See \npara. 12  for details. \n11 ADB developing member countries whose SAIs are not yet members of ASOSAI are Tajikistan, Timor-Leste, \nTurkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n12 The survey was to collect information on the engagement of training specialists for in-house training of member \nSAIs and seek suggestions on future training activities of ASOSAI. Of the 37 ASOSAI members, 30 responded to \nthe survey.  \n13  ADB. 1995. Governance: Sound Development Management. Manila. \n14 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila.  The related policy clarifications paper was approved in 2004. ", "  3\nand  strengthen  independence15  and  accountability  in  public  finance  and  expenditure \nmanagement in the region and at country levels.  SAIs play a major role in auditing government \naccounts and operations and in promoting sound financial management and accountability in \ntheir governments.  SAIs help ensure that public funds are properly safeguarded and used for \ntheir intended purposes. The TA will also provide tools to sustain regional cooperation among \nSAIs as trained auditors will apply harmonized INTOSAI auditing standards in their respective \ncountries, while trainers will conduct in-country workshops for national auditors.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10  The TA will improve the auditing capability of the targeted SAIs (para. 12) and upgrade \nthe training capacity of ASOSAI including its member SAIs. Enabling the trained auditors to \napply their acquired audit concepts and techniques in their audit work, as described in the SAIs \naction plans, the SAIs will produce consistent and high quality audits by following INTOSAI \nauditing standards. With more experienced audit trainers and additional course materials, SAIs \nwill be able to conduct extensive audit training and share audit experience and knowledge with \neach other more effectively. Such actions will enhance regional cooperation.  Consequently, the \nTA will have an important impact on good governance at country and regional levels.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The expected outputs consist of (i) at least four complete sets of course materials on at \nleast two technical audit subjects, with two sets each in English and Russian, (ii) two complete \nsets of course materials on two technical audit subjects translated into a local language to be \ndetermined during assessment of the capacity-building needs (para. 13), (iii) reports on two \ncapacity-building needs, (iv) 96 trained auditors from the targeted SAIs, (v) 14 experienced \nregional trainers, and (vi) action plans from the 10 targeted SAIs. With accessible updated \ncourse materials and experienced trainers, more training programs at the SAI levels will be \navailable to train their auditors on conducting audits according to INTOSAI auditing standards.  \nFurthermore, a practical action plan, including audit proposals from each participating SAI, will \nensure on-job application of the audit knowledge and skills learned. \n \n12.  Providing assistance to the targeted SAIs will ensure that the TA achieves the expected \noutcome. SAIs with less auditing experience needs more assistance in upgrading their audit \ncapability.  This TA identified the targeted SAIs and grouped them by geographical location and \nlanguage to be used as medium of instruction: (i) East and Central Asia, namely Azerbaijan, \nKazakhstan, Krygyz Republic, and Mongolia (targeted SAI group 1); and (ii) Mekong and South \nAsia, namely Afghanistan, Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic,16 Maldives, Myanmar, \nand Viet Nam (targeted SAI group 2). All course materials will be initially prepared in English.  \nFor targeted SAI group 1, the course materials will be translated into and delivered in Russian. \nFor targeted SAI group 2, the course materials will be delivered in English and translated into \none or two local languages.  \n \n13.  To accomplish the objectives, the key TA activities are: (i) two 3-week meetings to \nassess capacity-building needs and for the two SAI groups to, among others, identify immediate \n                                                 \n15  The  Subcommittee  on  Independence  under  the  INOSAI  Auditing  Standards  Committee  promotes  SAI \nindependence at International, regional, and local levels. \n16  The  SAI  of  the  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  is  expected  to  become  an  ASOSAI  member  during \nimplementation of this TA. \n ", "4  \ntraining needs and customize the training program to those needs and preferences;17 (ii) two 2-\nweek  preworkshop  trainers  meetings  to  design  and  develop  the  course  and  prepare  the \ncomplete set of required training materials; and (iii) four 2.5-week regional audit workshops, two \nin the Russian language for targeted SAI group 1 and another two in English for targeted SAI \ngroup 2.  The trainers\u2019 team will finalize the course material after delivering the audit courses, \nwith input from the participants' comments and lessons learned from course delivery. \n \n14.  The existing pool of ASOSAI regional trainers18 will provide candidates for the two \ntrainers\u2019 teams. The selection criteria will primarily be trainers\u2019 competence in course design and \ndelivery during the previous TAs and subsequent training they have conducted.  The secondary \nselection  factor  will  be  trainers\u2019  proficiency  in  English  (and  Russian),  particularly  for  the \nworkshops in Russian. SAI officials will participate in the meetings for assessing capacity-\nbuilding needs that the trainers\u2019 team will run and BAJ and IDI representatives will support. The \ninitial  survey  that  BAJ  conducted  concluded  that  SAIs,  in  general,  preferred  the  following \ntechnical audit subjects: (i) value for money audit, (ii) financial audit in an information technology \nenvironment, (iii) fraud and corruption, (iv) quality assurance, (v) information technology audit, \n(vi)  environmental  audit,  (vii)  audit  of  privatization,  (viii)  audit  of  public  debt,  (ix)  financial \nstatement audit, and (x) procurement audit. The specific audit subjects and depth of coverage \nmost appropriate for the targeted SAI groups 1 and 2 will be determined during the capacity \nbuilding needs assessment meetings. The survey teams will also assess the most appropriate \nand practical local language into which to translate materials. At the course design and delivery \nphases, each team will have a subject matter expert to offer audit expertise and other technical \nadvice.  The subject expert will assist the trainers' team in designing and developing the audit \ncourses, as well as provide technical advice to the team and the participants during the actual \nworkshops. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA\u2019s total cost is estimated at $1,116,600 equivalent of which ADB will finance \n$650,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nThe Government Auditing Foundation of Japan (GAF), on behalf of ASOSAI and IDI, will finance \nthe remaining $466,600 (Appendix 3). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  GAF  successfully  managed  previous  ASOSAI-related  TAs  and  will  be  this  TA\u2019s \nExecuting  Agency.    Established  in  1949  under  the  laws  of  Japan,  GAF  is  a  nonprofit \norganization that was authorized in 1995 to assume administrative responsibilities for ASOSAI's \ntraining programs. GAF has been supporting BAJ in organizing training, sponsoring research \nand publications, and collecting information on audit\u2013related fields. \n \n17.  To  permit  effective  learning  and  interaction,  the  maximum  class  size  will  be  28 \nparticipants. The criteria for selecting the participants from ADB member countries for the \nworkshops  will  include  current  experience,  demonstrated  personal  qualities,  personal \ncommitment, and involvement in audits of ADB-funded projects. To ensure that the trained \nauditors will continue with their audit function and will not be assigned to unrelated audit work \n                                                 \n17 Other nontraining capacity-building needs will be identified and addressed separately by ASOSAI and IDI and will \nnot form part of this TA. \n18 The pool of regional trainers consists of SAI auditors who had been trained as training specialists, through the \nprevious regional TAs as listed in footnotes 5 and 6. ", "  5\nfor at least 2 years, a written commitment from the heads of the SAIs, including individual audit \nproposals and action plans, will be obtained in a timely manner during TA implementation. \n \n18.  The TA will finance the international travel, accommodation, and per diem of trainers and \nsubject matter experts from ADB member countries, as well as a maximum of five workshop \nparticipants from each targeted SAI. ADB will support the preparation and reproduction of \nworkshop  materials,  rental  of  training  facilities  and  equipment,  shipping  costs  of  course \nmaterials, telecommunications, and other relevant miscellaneous expenses. Specifically, ADB \nwill finance the three audit workshops and the translation of course materials from English into \nRussian. GAF will cover the cost of the capacity-building assessment meeting and trainers team \nmeetings for the two targeted SAI groups, as well as one workshop for targeted SAI group 1. \nGAF will select the SAI that will host the capacity-building assessment meetings, preworkshop \ntrainers meetings, and regional audit workshops. The host SAI will support the basic expenses \nfor hosting the meetings and workshops (e.g., registration services, administrative, and clerical \nsupport).  \n \n19.  At completion of the TA, ASOSAI will post the course materials on its website and \ndisseminate  the  course  materials  in  CD-ROM  to  its  SAI  members  and  to  SAIs  members \ninvolved with training activities in seven other INTOSAI regional groups. The public can access \na listing of these course materials through ADB Institute's knowledge-sharing project. As part of \nthe written commitment of the SAIs (para. 17), the trained auditors will use these course \nmaterials to conduct training in their respective countries. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months, starting in August 2005 and ending in July \n2008. To ensure that the TA objectives are being achieved, reporting mechanisms will include \n(i)  workshop  reports,  to  be  submitted  3  months  after  completion  of  each  workshop;                   \n(ii) postworkshop survey reports, to be submitted 6 months after completion of the second and \nfourth  workshops,  for  a  combined  survey  on  the  first/second  and  third/fourth  workshops, \nrespectively; and (iii) TA final report, to be submitted 6 months after completion of the TA. The \nworkshop reports will include the participants\u2019 comments and the lessons trainers learned in \ndelivering the courses. The postworkshop survey reports will include participants\u2019 and SAI \ncomments about application of knowledge and skills acquired in the workshop, as well as any \nlocal training courses their trainers conducted. The final report will include GAF\u2019s assessment of \nthe overall TA and comments from the trainers, participants, and SAIs on the TA\u2019s impact on \ntheir SAIs in particular and ASOSAI in general. The evaluation criteria will be mutually agreed \nupon by ADB, GAF, and IDI. The letter agreement between ADB and GAF will be prepared and \nsigned accordingly. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000, to be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of Japan for Strengthening the Audit Capability of Members of \nthe Asian Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.\n ", "6  Appendix 1
