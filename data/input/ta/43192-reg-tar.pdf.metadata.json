INTRODUCTION \n1.  Growing regional cooperation and integration (RCI) has brought great economic benefits \nand peace dividends to many economies in Asia and the Pacific. The region has taken major \nstrides  in  regional  economic  cooperation  initiatives.  Increasing  intraregional  economic \ninterdependence  and  the  need  to  articulate  a  regional  response  to  shocks  have  clearly \ndemonstrated the benefits of such initiatives. The present challenge is to ensure a cooperative \nequilibrium between regional cooperation and national autonomy. \n \n2.  Recently, Central Asia has experienced a steady development of regional cooperation \nactivities, including intergovernmental forums on political and security issues, trade facilitation \ninitiatives,  and  programs  to  support  infrastructure  development  and  regional  connectivity, \namong  others.  These  forums,  in  addition  to  frequent  policy  interactions,  have  significantly \nfacilitated regionalism in Central Asia. \n \n3.  In  the  wake  of  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  subsequent  creation  of \nindependent states, and the ongoing global economic crisis, a new economic and financial \narchitecture is taking shape in Central Asia. Against this background, the process of regionalism \nwill be largely affected by how policy makers shape institutionalization in Central Asia, including \ndecisions on organizational forms and membership issues. In February 2009, the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Institute conducted a preliminary stocktaking and \nassessment of the performance of regional organizations in Central Asia.1 Similar studies have \nunderscored that achieving a state of cooperative equilibrium takes time and requires that all \nstakeholders adopt a flexible and constructive approach. Where multiple regional organizations \noverlap in membership and mandate, the risk of costly duplication must be addressed. This \ntechnical assistance (TA) will build on the work done by CAREC to take stock of and assess \nexisting RCI institutions in Central Asia, and provide suggestions for enhancing their capability \nto deliver RCI initiatives and programs in support of their respective mandates. In addition, the \nTA will build the capacity of Central Asian officials on RCI-related issues. The TA will also \ncomplement Institutions for Regionalism: Enhancing Economic Cooperation and Integration in \nAsia and the Pacific, a study undertaken by ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration \n(OREI).2 The TA will be implemented in close cooperation with ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia \nDepartment (CWRD) and the CAREC Institute in order to assess the accomplishments of \ninstitutions in Central Asia against their given mandate, and explore policy options to strengthen \ninstitutions and identify capacity development programs. The TA will also identify factors to \nimprove RCI activities in Central Asia by taking stock and learning from the experience of \nexisting  institutions  and  arrangements  in  other  regions.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.3\n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Since  the  early  1990s,  there  have  been  repeated  efforts  to  strengthen  regional \ncooperation in Central Asia through the establishment of a number of regional organizations \nsuch  as  the  Eurasian  Economic  Community,  Economic  Cooperation  Organization, \nCommonwealth  of  Independent  States,  Shanghai  Cooperation  Organization,  Central  Asian \nCooperation, Special Program for the Economies of Central Asia, and CAREC.  \n                                                 \n1  CAREC. 2009.

Technical  Assistance  for  Institutions  for  Regionalism:  Enhancing  Economic  Cooperation  and \nIntegration in Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA 7284-REG). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 June 2009. \n ", "2     \n \n5.  Central Asian regional organizations have helped build mutual confidence and trust \namong participating countries by providing regional platforms for governments to respond in a \nconcerted manner to emerging global and regional issues, such as terrorism, transnational \ncrime, environmental degradation, the spread of communicable diseases, and the contagion \neffect of financial and economic crises. The areas of focus of regional organizations in Central \nAsia are varied and include security cooperation, trade, energy, transport cooperation, natural \nresource management, and immigration.  \n \n6.  Regional  organizations  in  Central  Asia  have  varying  comparative  advantages.  The \nShanghai Cooperation Organization has done notable work in providing a forum for regional \nleaders to discuss common border, security, and economic issues. The Eurasian Economic \nCommunity has created a regional forum for its members to reach common ground on sharing \nwater resources and the treatment of migrants. The Economic Cooperation Organization and \nthe Special Program for the Economies of Central Asia focus on trade integration and facilitation, \nand  are  undertaking  reforms  to  increase  their  effectiveness.  CAREC  has  made  significant \nprogress  in  transport,  trade  facilitation  and  policy,  energy,  and  cross-border  infrastructure, \namong other areas; and is unique among regional organizations in Central Asia because it \nserves as a coordination mechanism among multilateral institutions, in addition to fostering \ncooperation among participating countries.  \n \n7.  Most regional organizations in Asia (and those in Central Asia in particular) can be \nbroadly  categorized  as  being  either  program-based,  or  network  and/or  institution-based. \nProgram-based organizations, such as CAREC, focus on specific activities of mutual interest to \na particular set of countries within the region. Network and/or institution-based organizations, \nsuch as the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, aim to either create integrated, region-wide \nframeworks or identify a set of general agreements for participating members as the basis for \ncooperation.  Some  of  these  institution-based  groupings  have  their  own  secretariats  with \npermanent staff and independent budgets. \n \n8.  Overall, program-based regional groupings in Central Asia may increase in prominence \nin  the  future  due  to  their  effective  reconciliation  of  long-term  benefits  with  short-term \nsocioeconomic costs. Network and/or institution-based regional groupings could also remain \nsignificant  in  the  region  due  to  their  important  role  in  promoting  economic  growth  and \nmaintaining peace and stability.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact of the TA will be improved effectiveness of Central Asian RCI \ninstitutions  in  promoting  regional  priorities  in  a  changing  regional  and  global  economic \nlandscape. The expected outcome of the TA will be policy recommendations to improve the \neffectiveness of RCI institutions in Central Asia.  \n \n10.  The expected outputs of the TA include (i) a stocktaking and assessment report on \nexisting RCI institutions in Central Asia; (ii) research papers on RCI institutions in Central Asia; \n(iii) workshops and seminars to discuss research papers and disseminate their findings; and (iv) \ntraining programs for relevant government officials and regional institutions in Central Asia on \nselected RCI topics. \n \n ", "3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will provide support to Central Asian countries in institutional strengthening and \ncapacity development. It will engage the services of international and national consultants to \nundertake  technical  studies,  organize  workshops  and  seminars,  and  conduct  capacity \ndevelopment and other activities.  \n \n12.  The TA will take stock of and assess the accomplishments of existing RCI institutions in \nCentral Asia against their given mandate. Building on the work of CAREC and others, the TA \nwill  explore  potential  policy  options  for  enhancing  RCI  institutional  capacity  to  deliver  RCI \ninitiatives and programs, and to fill the gap between the mandates and accomplishments of RCI \ninstitutions. Regional institutions and arrangements in the People's Republic of China (PRC) \nand Mongolia, which are both members of CAREC, will also be studied. Three main techniques \nwill be used to assess the accomplishments of RCI institutions against their initial mandate: (i) in \ncoordination with CWRD, consultants may interview key officials from RCI institutions and/or \nstakeholders in the line ministries using a questionnaire designed to identify specific institutional \nissues, including self-assessment by the institutions; (ii) the consultants will create a detailed list \nof the institutions\u2019 attributes and achievements; and (iii) a survey among opinion leaders in the \nregion will be conducted under a separate TA (footnote 2), focusing on their perceptions of RCI \ninstitutions. These inputs will be consolidated and conclusions presented in a project report. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  also  review  the  status  of  financial  cooperation  among  Central  Asian \neconomies and compare it with progress made by ASEAN+3 economies, including cooperation \nin regulatory issues, particularly among transition economies. Lessons and experience from \nEast Asia\u2014including examples of financial cooperation such as the Chiang Mai Initiative and \nthe Asian Bond Markets Initiative\u2014can offer direction for Central Asian countries to promote \nfinancial integration and cooperation on key policy initiatives and regulatory issues. These \nexercises will be conducted against the backdrop of lessons from other parts of Asia and the \nPacific, and other areas of the world. The outcomes of the stocktaking and assessment work \nmay be presented to appropriate regional forums, including CAREC ministerial meetings.  \n \n14.  The TA includes a capacity development component. The training programs will be \nidentified jointly by OREI and CWRD. The content of the training programs will be decided in \nclose  coordination  with  CWRD\u2014following  the  RCI  training  needs  that  have  already  been \nidentified by CWRD for Central Asia and in line with the CAREC Institute work plan for 2009\u2013\n2011.  The  capacity  development  component  of  the  TA  can  be  integrated  with  CAREC's \nleadership development initiative or public sector management short courses program. One of \nOREI's  comparative  advantages  in  capacity  development  is  its  long-established  training \nprogram on regional economic and financial monitoring. Relevant subjects from the training \nprogram can be integrated with CAREC\u2019s leadership development initiative.4 At the request of \nCWRD,  OREI  can  also  design  separate  training  programs  on  financial  cooperation  and \nintegration by drawing on the experience of the Asian Bond Markets Initiative, Chiang Mai \nInitiative, and the Asia\u2013Pacific Economic Cooperation Financial Regulators Training Initiative. \n \n15.  The TA will actively engage the RCI institutions and their stakeholders in Central Asia \nduring and after implementation. Knowledge products of the TA, including research papers and \n                                                 \n4  CAREC  leadership  development  initiative  courses  include  (i)  leadership,  styles,  approaches,  practice,  and \ncommunication; (ii) negotiation, persuasion, and influence; (iii) strategic thinking and planning; (iv) public sector \nmanagement; and (v) public sector finance.   \n \n ", "4     \nstocktaking  and  assessment  report  will  be  translated  into  Russian  and  an  extensive \ndissemination and outreach program will be carried out in consultation with CWRD and the \nDepartment of External Relations. CWRD and OREI will also disseminate the key messages of \nthe study at the next ADB Annual Meeting in Tashkent. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.   The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, which will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program  (Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund-IV).  The  cost  will  cover \nremuneration,  travel  and  per  diem  of  consultants,  trainings,  workshops,  publications,  and \nmiscellaneous  expenses.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  included  in \nAppendix 2.  \n  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Consultations  with  Central  Asian  countries  and  CAREC  will  be  undertaken  in \ncollaboration with CWRD. No-objection letters will be obtained from relevant countries once the \nlocation of workshops and other outreach activities have been identified. Three workshops and \ntwo training courses will be organized as part of this TA to gather inputs and conduct outreach \nactivities.  \n \n18.  International experts with expertise and experience in regional cooperation issues such \nas  macroeconomics,  financial  and  monetary  integration,  international  relations,  and  other \nrelevant fields will provide assistance in implementing the TA. An international consultant with \nknowledge of RCI institutions and a deep understanding of the structure of transition economies \nin Central Asia will be hired as the principal consultant. Another international consultant will be \nengaged to undertake a study of the status of financial cooperation in Central Asia and how it \ncan support ongoing regional trade cooperation. Resource persons will also be engaged to \nundertake specific functions (e.g., undertake peer reviews of background papers, participate as \ndiscussants  at  workshops,  write  special  notes,  and  hold  training  programs  for  capacity \ndevelopment programs on selected topics).   \n \n19.   A wide range of experts will be required and, therefore, all consultants will be selected \non  an  individual  basis.  The  consultants  will  work  separately  based  upon  their  individual \nresponsibilities, assignments, and outputs. OREI will be responsible for project implementation \nas well as administration and coordination of consultancy work. The consultants will be selected \nand engaged by OREI in close consultation with CWRD. Due to the complex and unique nature \nof  regional  cooperation  in  Central  Asia,  CWRD  management  will  provide  briefings  for  the \ninternational  consultants  prior  to  the  commencement  of  their  consultancy  work  to  ensure \neffective conduct of TA activities. A national consultant, who will be based in OREI and report to \nOREI staff managing the TA, will serve as the project coordinator and research assistant to help \nin  project  administration  and  implementation.  To  improve  dissemination  of  the  knowledge \nproducts (the research papers and stocktaking report) from the TA in Central Asia, Russian \ntranslation service providers and typesetters will be hired to translate, edit, and typeset the \nRussian  translation  of  the  publications.  To  successfully  implement  this  TA,  two  OREI \nprofessional staff will allocate much of their work plan to this TA.  \n \n20.  The TA will require 30 person-months of international consulting services, 24 person-\nmonths of national consulting services, and 15 person-months of resource persons\u2019 services. \nThe expertise of the consultants will range from political science to economics, and will include \neditors, workshop facilitators, and project administrators. The consultants will be selected and \n ", "5 \nengaged in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The terms of reference for consultants and resource persons are included in \nAppendix 3. The TA is expected to be completed over an 18-month period from July 2009 to \nDecember 2010. \nIV.
