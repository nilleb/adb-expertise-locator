For each subsequent \nsubproject, an IEE will be prepared as one of subproject approval \nrequirements. \n   \nProject Description  Since 2000, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported \nthe National Highways Development Program (NHDP), phase I \nand phase II, which aims to upgrade about 13,300 kilometers (km) \nof key arterial network  by the end of 2007. A program of this \nmagnitude  requires  broad-based  policy  actions,  from  building \nproject  implementation  capacity,  increasing  private  sector \nparticipation  (PSP),  to  improving  operation  and  maintenance \n(O&M).  ADB  has  supported  these  policy  actions  using  a \nprogrammatic approach through a multiyear lending program. The \nProject will be the fifth in the series of interventions, supporting the \nlast stage of the institutional strengthening program and financing \nthe upgrading of the north-south corridor. A road safety zone will \nbe implemented, and awareness on the risks of HIV/AIDS (human \nimmunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome) \nand human trafficking will also be provided. \n   \nRationale  Although  road  density  in  India  is  higher  than  that  in  many \ndeveloping countries, road network standards and conditions are \ninadequate to meet rapidly growing freight and passenger traffic. \nOnly 6% of  national highways (NHs) have four or more lanes, \nabout 25% of NHs have poor surface conditions, and many are \nseriously congested. This situation raises road-user costs; impairs \nroad safety and the quality and frequency of transport services; \nand limits roads\u2019 contribution to national development, economic \ngrowth, and poverty reduction.  \n \nFaced with the NH  system\u2019s capacity shortage, the Government \nhas initiated several radical actions, including (i) launching the \nambitious NHDP, (ii) establishing the National Highways Authority \nof  India  (NHAI),  (iii)  creating  a  central  road  fund,  and  (iv) \npromoting PSP. \n \n ", "ii     \n  The improved network will encourage economic activity and ease \n  the mobility of people who seek jobs, but may also potentially \nincrease social risks. Road accidents have continued to increase, \non average by 5% a year over the past two decades. About one \nthird of fatalities occur on NHs. Increased incidence of HIV/AIDS \nis  also  a  risk, as is  trafficking  of  vulnerable  rural  people  for \nexploitative labor, because the improved network may facilitate \ntraffickers\u2019 operations across the country. \n \nThe  challenges  facing  NHAI  require  multidimensional  skills. \nManaging about 6,000 km of completed NHs, completing the east-\nwest and north-south corridors by 2007, and upgrading additional \n10,000 km of NHDP-III roads need to be done simultaneously \nusing a well-structured mechanism. \n   \nObjective   The Project\u2019s main objective is to improve transport efficiency \nleading to expanded economic opportunities.  This objective will \nbe  achieved  through  (i)  strengthening  NHAI  capacity  for  NH \ndevelopment and O&M; (ii) upgrading and increasing the capacity \nof 566 km of key national arterial corridors, particularly the north-\nsouth  corridor;  (iii)  improving  road  safety;  and  (iv)  preventing \nspread of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated total cost is $670.6 million equivalent, inclusive of \ntaxes,  duties,  interest  during  implementation,  and  commitment \ncharges. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at $418.6 million, \nand local currency costs at $252.0 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nSource  Foreign  Local  Total  % \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nAsian Development  379.1  20.9  400.0  59.6 \nBank         \nGovernment  39.5  231.1  270.6  40.4 \nTotal  418.6  252.0  670.6  100.0  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will make the loan proceeds available promptly \nTerms  to NHAI. The Government follows a current loan-grant ratio of \n20:80. The Government will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloan. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2008 \n   ", "iii\n  \n \nEstimated Project  30 June 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  NHAI \n \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented through the north-south corridor \nArrangements   project  management  unit,  responsible  for  overall  project \ncoordination. For the institutional-strengthening component, the \ngeneral manager (administration) will be responsible for day-to-\nday implementation. For civil works implementation, three project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established  in  Lalitpur, \nNarsinghpur, and Anantpur. The road safety component will be \nimplemented by the corridor management unit. The HIV/AIDS and \nanti-trafficking  component  will  be  implemented  by  NHAI\u2019s \nenvironment and social development unit in coordination with the \nNational AIDS Control Organization. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s \ntender procedures acceptable to ADB. The civil works contracts \nwill be procured under international competitive bidding (ICB). \nSupply contracts of over $500,000 will be procured under ICB; \n$100,000\u2013500,000, international shopping; and under $100,000, \ndirect purchase arrangements. \n   \nConsulting Services  All  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants  and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. \nConsulting  services  will  be  required  for  (i)  institutional \nstrengthening, (ii) construction supervision, (iii) road safety zone \nimplementation,  and  (iv)  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking \nawareness  raising.  Overall,  about  293  person-months\u2019 \ninternational  and  4,625  person-months\u2019  domestic  consultant \ninputs will be required.  \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will support NHAI in its institutional strengthening \nBeneficiaries  efforts so that it performs its mandate efficiently, contributing to \noverall  transport  efficiency.  This  will  improve the returns and \nsustainability of NH investments, and encourage a wide range of \neconomic activities that make use of NH transport services.  \n \nThe north-south corridor intersects the golden quadrilateral and \neast-west  corridor.  Long-distance  traffic  is  thus  expected  to \nchange drastically as road users find shorter routes. Delays and \nhold-ups at railway crossings and major road intersections will be \nobviated. Slow traffic, congestion, and accidents will be reduced \nconsiderably.  The  road  safety  zone  will  provide a model for \nreducing accidents. Overall, the Project will improve the corridor\u2019s \ntransport efficiency, speed up traffic, improve travel conditions, \nand reduce journey time and vehicle operating costs. \n ", "iv     \n  The Project will spread the benefits of economic development by \ncatalyzing forward-backward linkages, uplifting the people in the \nproject  area,  most  of  whom  are  poor.  The  immediate  project \nbenefits for them are skilled and unskilled jobs during project \nconstruction. In the long run, the Project will bring the people \nsocioeconomic benefits and opportunities. \n \nThe economic internal rate of return was calculated at 14.9 %. \nThe poverty impact ratio is more than 1, indicating that the Project \nis pro-poor, since total net economic benefits reaching the poor \nwill exceed the total net economic project benefits.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The risk is that NHAI institutional strengthening efforts may take \nlonger than expected. This risk has been addressed in the project \ndesign  by  providing  technical  support  to  achieving  NHAI\u2019s \nmedium-term  institutional  strengthening  objectives.  The \ninstitutional-strengthening component will help NHAI implement its \nprogram and strengthen NHAI\u2019s program management capability. \n \nThe  risk  of  delayed  implementation  has  been  lessened  by \nadvance action, early establishment of PIUs, and strengthening of \nNHAI\u2019s project management. \n \nThe risks associated with the improved highway network have \nbeen eased by auditing road safety, providing a road safety zone, \nand raising awareness of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n \n \n \n ", "    v\n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto India for the National Highway Sector II Project. The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  India's economic reforms have resulted in a real gross domestic product growth of \naround 6% in the 1990s, with an average growth rate of about 8% in the decade\u2019s latter half. \nAlthough the growth rate was much less during the last 2 years, demand for transport is \nexpected to grow at about 10% per year. The transport sector is multimodal, and road transport \nis dominant, accounting for 60% of freight movement and 80% of passenger traffic. The road \nnetwork totals some 3.4 million kilometers (km), of which 65,569 km are national highways \n(NHs).1 The network has grown 8.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951. The NH network makes up \nabout 1.9% of the country\u2019s road network but carries about 40.0% of total traffic. Over the last \ndecade, the number of automobiles has been growing by 9.0%, and of heavy vehicles by 7.6%. \nIn 2002, India had 59 million vehicles.  \n \n3.  Road density is now 1 km/km2, higher than that in many developing countries. However, \nthe standards and condition of the road network are inadequate to meet rapidly growing \ndemand for freight and passenger traffic. In early 2004, about 31% of the NH network was still \nsingle-lane standard, 63% two-lane, and only 6% four-lane or more. More than 25% of NHs are \nin poor surface condition, and many are seriously congested. Internationally, a goods vehicle \ntravels on average 600 km a day, while in India until recently, only about 250 km a day. Poor \nroad conditions raise road-user costs, impair road safety, and diminish the quality and frequency \nof transport services. Such conditions also limit roads\u2019 contribution to national development, \neconomic growth, and poverty reduction. The detailed sector overview is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  Road freight service provision is a private sector activity. Entry into the market is not \nrestricted. While the Motor Vehicle Act allows state governments to set freight rates, they rarely \ndo so. Thus, in practice, freight rates are not regulated, resulting in intense competition among \ntruckers. Reductions in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) from improved road conditions are \ngenerally passed on to the buyers of freight services. \n \n5.  Road passenger transport services are provided by the public and private sectors, but \nthe public sector share has declined to about 20%. State governments control market entry and \nregulate  passenger  fares,  which  are  kept  low  by  political  pressure.  Regional  transport \nauthorities  regulate  safety  and  environmental  aspects  and  are  responsible  for  vehicle \nregistration  and  driver  licensing.  Due  to  these  regulatory  policies,  competition  is  limited. \nAlthough the economy as a whole would gain from VOC reduction, since fares are regulated \nand most publicly owned operators are not covering their costs, only part of this reduction is \npassed on to passengers.  \n6.  Road accidents have continued to increase, on average by 5% a year over the past 2 \ndecades. In 2003, fatalities numbered about 96,000, and injuries, 400,000. The fatality rate per \n10,000 vehicles has remained around 20 for the past few years, compared with less than 10 in \n                                                 \n1  The NH network totaled 58,112 km until February 2004, when 7,457 km were added. ", "2   \nsome industrialized Asian countries. The rate per million population has continued to increase \nfrom 27 in 1971 to 95 in 2003. About one third of fatalities occur on NHs. \n \n7.  Although  the  improved  network  will  promote  economic  activity  and  provide  job \nopportunities, it may also increase social risks, including incidence of HIV/AIDS.2 HIV/AIDS \ninfection is typically concentrated among poor and marginalized groups, including sex workers, \ndrug users, migrant laborers, and truck drivers. The widespread perception is that these groups, \nparticularly truckers, have been seen to contribute to the rapidly spreading HIV/AIDS epidemic. \nThe improved network may also increase human trafficking for exploitative labor by easing \ntraffickers\u2019 operations across the country. \n  \nB.  Government Strategy \n \n8.  Faced  with  the  highway  system\u2019s  capacity  shortage,  the  Government  has  initiated \nseveral actions, including (i) launching ambitious NH programs; (ii) establishing the National \nHighways Authority of India (NHAI); (iii) creating a central road fund; and (iv) promoting private \nsector participation (PSP) in financing, upgrading, operating, and maintaining NHs. \n \n9.  National Highways Development Program.  In 1998, the Government launched the \nNational  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP)  to  rehabilitate  and  widen  the  golden \nquadrilateral (about 6,000 km), connecting the major cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, and \nChennai. This program has been substantially completed. The second phase of NHDP (NHDP-\nII) consisting of upgrading the north-south corridor (about 4,000 km) and the east-west corridor \n(about 3,300 km) is currently under implementation and expected to be completed by December \n2007. The third phase of NHDP (NHDP-III) is currently under consideration by the Government, \ncovering about 10,000 km, and consisting of (i) corridors of high-density traffic; (ii) corridors \nlinking state capitals to  the NHDP network; and (iii) roads providing access  to tourist and \neconomic centers.3 \n \n10.  Separation between Policy and Implementation Functions. The Ministry of Shipping, \nRoad Transport and Highways (MSRTH) is responsible for developing and maintaining NHs; \nformulating road transport policies; coordinating state roads; and issuing guidelines on highway \nplanning, design, and construction. In 1988, to separate MSRTH\u2019s planning and implementation \nfunctions, NHAI was established as a statutory body. Initially, it was given the responsibility for \nbuilding and maintaining the NH network and expressways under externally aided projects and \nPSP. In 1998, NHAI became responsible for implementing the NHDP.  \n \n11.  Road Financing. To develop the road network, a dedicated central road fund was \nestablished, mainly supported by an additional excise duty (\u201ccess\u201d) on petrol and diesel, which \ninitially was Rs1.0 per liter, and increased to Rs1.5 in 2003. About one third of the funds are for \nNHs and have been committed until 2018 to implement the NHDP-I, NHDP-II, and service its \ndebt. To complete the NHDP-I and NHDP-II, NHAI estimated that a total of $33.8 billion over \nFY1999-2019 is required: $15.1 billion for capital financing and $18.7 billion for debt service. \nNHAI is expected to raise $17.7 billion from cess, $10.7 from market borrowings, $3.6 billion \nfrom external assistance, and $1.8 billion from private sector financing. The proposed NHDP-III \nis intended to be implemented under PSP schemes to the largest extent possible. \n \n                                                 \n2  Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n3  The Government also launched an ambitious rural road improvement program to connect all villages with more \nthan 500 people. ", "    3\n12.  Private Sector Participation. PSP success requires a conducive policy and institutional \nframework. In 1997 MSRTH issued Guidelines for the Private Sector Participation in the Road \nInfrastructure, and took a series of policy actions, including (i) exempting build-operate-transfer \n(BOT)  investors  from  taxation;  (ii)  indicating  Government  commitment  in  all  preparatory \nactivities, including land acquisition and removal of utilities; (iii) enabling the Government to \nprovide grants of up to 40% of project cost; (iv) allowing foreign direct investments up to 100% \nequity  participation;  (v)  allowing  duty-free  import  of  modern  high-performance  construction \nequipment; and (vi) amending the NH Act to authorize private sector investors to operate a part \nof the NH system and collect tolls under Government regulation. NHAI was also empowered to \nform joint ventures with private sector investors, form special-purpose vehicles (SPVs), invest \nand lend the funds for such ventures, and raise funds by issuing debentures in the capital \nmarkets. \n \nC.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Challenges \n \n13.  Project  Implementation  Capacity.  About  3,970  km  of  NHDP  network  have  been \ncompleted, 400 km will be completed by December 2004, and about 2,600 km will be completed \nby December 2006. More than 6,000 km of NHDP-II have yet to be awarded. The average \ncontract implementation period is 2.5\u20133.0 years. To complete the NHDP-II by the end of 2007 \nas planned, all remaining works have to be awarded by the first semester of 2005. So far, NHAI \nhas issued about 35 contracts for a total of 1,400 km per year on average. To meet the target \ncompletion date, NHAI needs to improve its capacity to prepare and contract out projects. While \nkeeping the organization lean is important, the magnitude of the remaining tasks will require \nNHAI to revisit its human resources capacity. Managing a large number of consultants engaged \nfor project preparation is difficult, sometimes leading to poor-quality outputs due to lack of \nsupervision  and  quality  control.  NHAI  has  thus  established  a  technical  review  function \nmechanism, by involving experts from outside NHAI, for quality control. The technical review \nteam\u2019s role is to review all feasibility reports and detailed project designs prepared by NHAI \nconsultants. The final approval is provided by a technical audit team, consisting of chief general \nmanagers; and technical, finance, and environment and social general managers (GMs).   \n \n14.  NHAI  outsources  construction  supervision  to  private  consulting  firms.  Management \noversight is provided through project implementation units (PIUs) run by NHAI senior staff. \nEngineers\u2019 high level of authority, together with the internal audit system, ensures efficient and \nobjective decision-making. Although this has enabled NHAI to improve project implementation, \nas of March 2004, of 78 projects under implementation, 31 were reportedly 2\u201312 months late.  \n \n15.  NHAI also recognizes that, while it needs to strengthen its contract management and \nsupervision capacity, it also needs to improve highway standards and the code of practice. \nPlanning, design, construction, and operation of roads are generally based on standards and \ncodes  of  practice  prepared  and  published  by  the  Indian  Roads  Congress.  For  specific \napplication to NH works, MSRTH and/or NHAI also issue instructions and guidelines from time \nto time. However, some of the standards require updating and rationalization to be compatible \nwith the ground situation and international practice. While the regulatory function remains with \nMSRTH, with its experience in developing over 6,000 km of highways, NHAI can better provide \ninput to improve highway standards and the code of practice.  \n \n16.  Good project preparation and implementation management are also critical for NHAI to \nimplement the proposed NHDP-III. Since it will be implemented under a PSP scheme wherever ", "4   \npossible,  and  as  NHAI  should  remain  lean,  outsourcing  of  project  preparation  and \nimplementation should be explored. Under the ongoing technical assistance (TA),4 the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) is helping NHAI prepare a mechanism to implement the proposed \nNHDP-III.  \n \n17.  Operation and Maintenance. As more highways are completed, effective operation and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  are  critical.  Newly  upgraded  highways  need  to  be  maintained,  tolls \ncollected efficiently, rights of way kept clear, and road accidents minimized.5 Outsourcing to the \nprivate sector is the best way to ensure effective and efficient O&M.  \n \n18.  In August 2002, NHAI awarded two long-term (8-year) O&M contracts, for NH8 (Delhi-\nJaipur) and NH2 (Delhi-Agra). A corridor management concept prepared with World Bank \nassistance is being implemented on a pilot basis for NH1 for about 270 km. Under the ADB \nongoing project,6 an O&M contract is being developed and will be awarded when upgrading of \nthe Surat-Manor section is completed by June 2005. The model contract will be applied as \nappropriate on all other ADB-assisted project roads. \n  \n19.  In December 2000, the cabinet decided that all four-lane highways under NHAI would be \ntolled, and that NHAI would utilize the toll revenues for O&M and debt service. The initial tariff \nlevels  are  set  (in  1997  prices)  at  Rs0.4,  Rs0.7,  and  Rs1.4  per  km  for  passenger  cars, \nminibuses, and buses or trucks, respectively.7 The toll policy allows annual escalation based on \nwholesale price index. The current toll rates are Rs0.535, Rs0.937, and Rs1.874 per km \n($0.012\u2013$0.042 per km) for passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and buses  or trucks, \nrespectively. To cover O&M and debt service, NHAI must collect toll revenues through an \nefficient toll system. Assisted by ADB, a toll system study is ongoing and will be completed by \nJune 2005. \n \n20.  The road safety audit study is being done under the ADB-assisted Western Transport \nCorridor Project. The \u201croad safety zone\u201d concept, which includes overloaded-vehicle control, is \nbeing  developed  under  the  ADB-assisted National Highway Sector Project I.8 This concept \nneeds to be replicated in other NH sections. \n \n21.  As several component schemes of corridor management are being implemented on a \npilot basis, NHAI should eventually comprehensively evaluate the implementation of long-term \nO&M  contracts,  tolling  system,  and  road  safety  zone  concept.  An  integrated  corridor \nmanagement program then needs to be developed, incorporating lessons from each pilot \nscheme. \n \n22.  Financial  Viability  and  Sustainability.  NHAI\u2019s  cash-flow  projection  is  heavily \ndependent  on  market  borrowings,  i.e.,  at  more  than  30%  of  total  funding  requirements \n(Appendix 3). To complete NHDP-II, from FY2004 onward, additional market borrowings of $9 \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2003.

Manila \n ", "    5\nbillion will need to be raised and bonds to be issued for debt service. The market has been \nreceptive  to  NHAI  offerings  on  the  strength  of  future  assured  inflow  of  cess  from  the \nGovernment. However, given the size of market borrowing, the absorptive capacity of the \nnational bond and debt market should be assessed. Over the long term, toll revenue will be a \nmajor  source  of  NHAI\u2019s  revenue  to  cover  corridor  management  expenditures  and  other \noperating expenses. As projected toll revenue must be collected effectively, NHAI should \ndevelop and adopt an efficient tolling system as soon as possible. To ensure its financial \nsustainability, NHAI should also be able to retain toll collection revenue and spend it on O&M. A \nmemorandum of understanding between MSRTH and NHAI to give NHAI the right to retain and \nuse the tolls has been drafted and is under scrutiny of the Ministry of Law. \n \n23.  The proposed NHDP-III's financing plan may be plausible if innovative modalities for \nPSP are devised to attract more private sector investment. The ongoing TA (footnote 5) \nincludes exploration of possible financing modalities for the NHDP-III. The hybrid annuity-toll-\nbased model developed during processing of the proposed Project could be used as an \nalternative model. \n \n24.  Private  Sector  Participation.  Totaling  about  $480  million,  8  contracts  have  been \nawarded as annuity concessions, 7 as toll-based BOT concessions, and 10 to SPVs. These \ncover about 1,312 km of the network, which is about 10% of the NHDP-I and NHDP-II or 16% of \nthe contracted network. Annuity and toll-based BOT concessions have offered efficiency gains. \nA review of PSP in  the NH development mandated to NHAI (Supplementary Appendix A) \nillustrates that the schemes successfully transferred the initial financing, construction, and O&M \nrisks to the private sector, thus freeing up resources for social purposes. These efficiency gains \nneed to be considered in the strategic context of estimating the cost of public sector vis-\u00e0-vis \nprivate sector procurement. \n \n25.  The existence of large and certain traffic volumes is a precondition for toll-based BOT \nconcessions, which was present in the golden quadrilateral corridor. However, most of the \nremaining highways along the north-south and east-west corridors lack such traffic, so creating \nfinancially viable toll-based BOT concessions is difficult. Although annuity concessions are more \nsuitable, one of the main arguments used against the annuity scheme is that traffic risk is not \ntransferred to the private sector. This problem could be solved by introducing an innovative \ndeclining  annuity  combined  with  tolling  concession  model  (see  para.  23).  NHAI  is  taking \nnecessary actions to obtain the Government\u2019s approval in adopting this new model, and will \nexplore possibilities to pilot this model for the high-density traffic corridor under NHDP-III. If \nsuccessful, this model may be expanded to the remaining network. In addition, since NHDP-III \nwill be implemented through PPP as much as possible, ADB is providing assistance to explore \nmore alternatives to attract private sector financing (footnote 5). \n \n26.  HIV/AIDS  and  Human  Trafficking.  The  environment  and  social  development  unit  \n(ESDU) will establish a cell exclusively to implement and monitor HIV/AIDS prevention and anti-\ntrafficking interventions. A collaborative model between NHAI and the National AIDS Control \nOrganization has been developed, involving contribution of technical expertise by state AIDS \ncontrol societies. Assisted by the World Bank, a consultant has been appointed to develop a \nframework  for  the  cell,  including  staffing  and  budgetary  requirements.  Further  consulting \nassistance will be required to help this cell develop a comprehensive strategy and program to \nprevent and control HIV/AIDS and human trafficking along NHs mandated to NHAI. \n \n \n ", "6   \n  2.  Institutional and Organizational Aspects \n \n27.  The issues and challenges outlined above raise the question whether NHAI's structure \nand organization and its internal processes are appropriate to meet its challenges. These \naspects  were  reviewed  in  the  World  Bank-assisted  Institutional  Strengthening  Study.  It \nconcludes that the current arrangement is appropriate but could be made more efficient. The \nstudy\u2019s recommendations for institutional strengthening are summarized in a draft corporate \nplan for NHAI to be finalized and accepted by the Government. The study and plan are being \nfinalized to reflect comments and new developments such as NHAI\u2019s new mandate over the \nNHDP-III. The corporate plan\u2019s measures should be specific and time-bound, and provide a \nvehicle to detail and monitor the agreed-on measures to strengthen NHAI.  \n \n28.  The study reviewed the legal status of NHAI and concluded  that it, with Government \noversight, has a number of benefits: (i) ability to raise funds from the capital market; (ii) ability to \nfacilitate corridor management for aspects that require close coordination with the central and \nstate governments; (iii) flexibility to adopt commercial accounting principles and follow generally \naccepted accounting standards; (iv) ability to promote joint ventures.  \n \n29.  Although  NHAI  has  brought  private  sector  efficiency  to  NH  management,  profit \nmaximization and financial self-sufficiency are not the objectives. NHAI\u2019s mandate will continue \nto broaden due to several factors, including the following: (i) the NH network remains grossly \ninadequate in many respects despite recent significant advances; (ii) NH development is on \nexisting alignments, with a large proportion of traffic being local; (iii) no alternative roads are \navailable for interregional traffic; and (iv) the roads are considered a public good. Owing to \nthese  factors,  and  the  fact  that  road  users  already  contribute  significantly  to  road  sector \nrevenues through various user charges other than toll, the scope for mobilizing more resources \nfrom road users, e.g., by increasing toll rates, is limited. NH development will remain dependent \non Government contribution and, therefore, in the medium term, NHAI should remain a statutory \nbody. \n \n30.  The  key  challenge  is  to  enhance  NHAI\u2019s  efficiency.  Achievements  should  be \nconsolidated and some key areas should be strengthened. The focus should be to strengthen \n(i) the external (authorizing) environment, where policy parameters shape the conditions and \nmandates under which NHAI operates; and (ii) NHAI\u2019s organizational structure and processes. \nThe  status,  achievements  of,  and  targets  for  NHAI  strengthening  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix B. Based on these, NHAI and ADB agreed to work toward achieving the objectives of \nthe medium-term institutional-strengthening framework (Appendix 4) as summarized below. \n \n31.  With regard to the external environment, some key short- and medium-term priorities \ninclude (i) developing MSRTH\u2019s policy and regulatory function, (ii) incorporating technically and \nfinancially  feasible  program  targets  in  an  agreed-on  corporate  plan,  (iii)  formalizing \narrangements  for  NHAI  to  retain  toll  revenues,  (iv)  improving  the  PSP  framework  and \ndeveloping modalities suited to the nature of the NH system and its traffic, (v) expanding and \nimproving the input from nongovernment stakeholders in oversight arrangements, and (vi) \nmaking NHAI\u2019s human resource policies more flexible. \n \n32.  With regard to NHAI\u2019s internal organization and processes, some key priorities include (i) \nimplementing  an  organizational  structure  based  on  the  two  core  businesses  of  project \nmanagement and corridor management; (ii) streamlining the project management function by \ncodifying  and  updating  standards  and  guidelines;  (iii)  initiating  pilot  schemes  for  corridor \nmanagement; (iv) increasing the proportion of permanent staff for continuity in personnel for ", "    7\ncore functions; (v) establishing management of information technology and system strategies \nand plans; and (vi) strengthening financial management, programming, and budgeting.  \n \n3.  External Assistance  \n \n33.  ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) are the main \nexternal agencies supporting NHAI. ADB has provided four loans of $1.14 billion total; World \nBank, three loans of $1.22 billion total; and JBIC, one loan of about $300 million equivalent. \nNHAI has also attracted private sector financing of about $1.8 billion (Appendix 5).  \n \n34.  ADB and World Bank have been working closely and agreed on a coordinated strategy \nin assisting NHAI and ensure that the synergy of interventions will optimize development \nimpacts. While the World Bank is helping NHAI conduct the institutional-strengthening study, \npilot the corridor management concept, and prepare the road information system, ADB is \nhelping conduct the tolling system study, develop an O&M contract, pilot a road safety zone, \nand strengthen NHAI\u2019s corporate financing capability. \n \n4.  Lessons Learned \n \n35.  To avoid unnecessary delays in project implementation, several actions have been \napplied, including (i) advance action for procurement of the civil works contracts and recruitment \nof  supervision  consultants;  (ii)  early  establishment  of  PIUs;  (iii)  advance  land  acquisition, \nresettlement, shifting of utilities, and clearance of rights of way; (iv) strict prequalification criteria; \nand  (v)  adoption  of  the  role  of  \u201cengineer\u201d  in  accordance  with  international  best  practice \n(following the Federation Internationale des Ingenieurs-Conseils). Despite the progress achieved, \nthe last two projects were delayed by prolonged procurement. ADB started project processing \nbased on a feasibility study, but the detailed design and bid documents were not ready by \nproject  approval.  For  the  proposed  Project,  NHAI  has  arranged  that  the  feasibility  study \nconsultants also prepare the detailed design and bidding documents, and ensured that these \ndocuments will be ready by February 2005. Furthermore, ADB has approved a TA to prepare at \nleast two projects for the next 3 years.9 This will help project preparation in advance, and give \nNHAI time to prepare detailed design and bid documents early. \n \n36.  Some NHAI institutional and policy studies, including on toll strategy and O&M contract \ndevelopment, were delayed. With the completion of about 6,000 km of the NHDP, these studies \nand  other  institutional  strengthening  need  to  be  done  soon  if  NHAI  is  to  meet  its  new \nchallenges. The proposed Project will provide a consultant to facilitate and coordinate all policy-\nrelated activities. As suggested by the project performance audit report of Loan 918-IND,10 the \nProject will help NHAI evaluate and integrate O&M, tolling, and road safety into a integrated \ncorridor management concept. \n \n5.  ADB Sector Strategy\u2014Programmatic Approach \n \n37.  Since  2001,  a  programmatic  approach  has  been  used  to  support  NHAI  capacity \nstrengthening efforts in a progressive and evolutionary manner. The medium-term objectives \nare to (i) strengthen project development and implementation capability; (ii) promote PSP in \nhighway development, tolling, and O&M; (iii) strengthen fund mobilization; (iv) strengthen O&M; \nand (v) restructure NHAI to make it more efficient. The achievement of this programmatic \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the High Priority National Highways Project. Manila.  \n10  ADB. 2002. Project Performance Audit Report on the Road Improvement Project in India. Manila. ", "8   \napproach  is  assessed  in  Supplementary  Appendix  C,  and  concluded  in  the  following \nparagraphs. \n \n38.  The  programmatic  approach  is  highly  relevant  to  the  Government\u2019s  priority  to \nexpeditiously complete a modern, safe NH network. To perform its role, NHAI must have \nsufficient  implementation  capability,  secure  financing,  private  sector  participation,  O&M \ncapability, and effective organization. This approach is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy \nprogram as well as the Government\u2019s transport policy. \n \n39.  NHAI is financially and managerially capable of implementing NHDP and of attracting \nPSP. NHAI has begun to award O&M and corridor management contracts to the private sector, \nand to finalize its own corporate plan and institutional restructuring. Thus, the programmatic \napproach  has  achieved  its  immediate  objectives  and  purposes.  However,  NHAI\u2019s \nimplementation capability needs to be strengthened, particularly since the agency is now also \nresponsible for the NHDP-III, and the NHDP-II is yet to be completed. Corridor management is \nmoving in the right direction but it is still new and, therefore, needs to be continuously overseen \nand strengthened. Nevertheless, the institutional restructuring plan is technically sound and, \nonce finalized and implemented, will enable NHAI to perform all its responsibilities, including \ncompletion of the NHDP and operation and maintenance of the completed network.  \n \n40.  The  programmatic  approach  is  a  timely  and  sound  initiative  and  provides  a  clear \nframework for ADB's and others' financial support, and for Government and NHAI institutional \nstrengthening and policy reform. The need for regular reviews and possibly for midcourse \ncorrections  was  recognized  when  the  approach  was  formulated.  Specific  goals  under  the \ndifferent policy areas and trigger points were adjusted during the last three projects, providing \nwelcome flexibility. However, the evolution of goals and targets was not recorded in formal \nunderstandings between the Government and ADB, and likely contributed to the Government \nand  NHAI  giving  more  attention  to  implementing  the  physical  investment  program  at  the \nexpense of institutional and policy reform. To improve the programmatic approach, milestones \nwith an implementation time frame have been agreed on under the Project. The approach has \nto be reviewed regularly, and a completion review is recommended for 2008. \n \n41.  NHAI\u2019s exposure, skills, and knowledge in implementing a huge program within a limited \nperiod; accessing market borrowing; attracting and engaging the private sector; operating and \nmaintaining the network; and in sustaining the private sector\u2019s efficiency, result-oriented culture, \nand quick decision making, need to be maintained. The impact of the programmatic approach is \nsustainable but not as much as it should be due to frequent staff changes. Therefore, quality \nstaff should be retained and permanent core staff should be increased. \n \n42.  The challenges facing NHAI require multidimensional skills. Managing the completed \nnetwork, completing the NHDP-II in 3.5 years, and implementing the NHDP-III necessitate well-\ndesigned structures and mechanisms. The objectives in the programmatic approach will remain \nrelevant, and ADB will continue to help NHAI pursue them.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n43.  The Project is the fifth in the series of interventions, supporting the last stage of the \nNHAI  institutional  strengthening  program  and  financing  the  upgrading  of  the  north-south ", "    9\ncorridor. The main objective of the Project is to improve transport efficiency, contributing to \nexpansion of economic opportunities. This objective will be achieved through (i) strengthening \nNHAI to perform its core role of development, operation and maintenance of the NH network \nunder its responsibility; (ii) upgrading and increasing capacity of 566 km of key national arterial \ncorridors, along the north-south corridor; and (iii) improving road safety.11 The Project is in \naccordance with the strategy outlined in the Country Strategy and Program Update (2005-\n2007),  and  also  supports  the  Government's  transport  strategy.  In  NH  subsector,  ADB's \nstrategies are to further strengthen project development and implementation  capability and \nenhance PSP.12 The Project Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n1.  Institutional-Strengthening Component \n \n44.  As  detailed  in  Appendix  6,  the  Project  will  help  NHAI  to  achieve  its  institutional-\nstrengthening objectives (Appendix 4) and ensure that all NHAI\u2019s institutional and policy-related \nactivities, conducted with or without external assistance, are consistent with the institutional \nstrengthening  program  to  improve  NHAI\u2019s  efficiency.  The  Project  will  also  include  (i) \nstrengthening project management; and (ii) updating standards and the code of practice for \nplanning, design, construction, and maintenance of highways.  \n \n45.  The component  will help NHAI facilitate review of project management in the golden \nquadrilateral (NHDP-I), and draw lessons from the evaluation, assess the current and future \nwork  load,  and  estimate  the  staff  resources  and  skills  mix  required  by  NHAI  to  fulfill  its \nexpanding mandate. As contract management is a core NHAI function, procedures and forms to \nprocure different services, e.g., civil works contracts, feasibility study contracts, detailed design \ncontracts, PPP agreements, O&M concessions, etc., should be reviewed and updated.  \n \n46.  The component will facilitate streamlining of project preparation and implementation by \ncodifying and updating existing, and developing new, guidelines and standards for highway \nplanning, design, construction, and maintenance. These improved standards and guidelines will \nfacilitate integration of new officers into the PIU teams and provide the basis for effective quality \ncontrol.  \n \n2.  Highway Development Component \n \n47.  This component will widen and upgrade 566 km of subprojects along the north-south \ncorridor as listed in Appendix 14, unless otherwise mutually agreed between the Government \nand  ADB.  The  project  roads  will  be  widened  to  24  meters,  and  the  pavement  will  be \nstrengthened. Bridges, drainage structures, and culverts will also be improved and replaced as \nnecessary. The road network will be able to meet traffic demand for up to 20 years. The \nhighway design features are in Appendix 7. \n \n48.  The component covers 313 km of NH26 (Lalitpur-Lakhnadon) and 253 km of NH7 \n(between Kurnool and Andhra Pradesh-Karnataka border), unless otherwise mutually agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB. The roads are part of the NHDP network and determined \n                                                 \n11 The Project has been prepared through Technical Assistance to India for Preparing the National Highway Sector II \nProject (ADB. 2003. Manila). \n12 During processing of the Project a PPP scheme has been explored, however, there was no section under the \nProject highways found feasible for attracting the private sector financing. NHAI is exploring possibilities to adopt \nthe proposed hybrid BOT-annuity model for the NHDP-III. ", "10   \nbased on economic viability and environmental and social concerns. The subprojects are being \nprepared following the requirements and procedures set forth in  Appendix  8.  Once  these \nsections are completed, their O&M will be contracted out to the private sector. \n \n3.  Road Safety Component \n \n49.  This component (Appendix 9) will adopt the implementation arrangements of the road \nsafety zone concept, being developed under Loan 2029 (footnote 9).  A section of about 200 km \nalong the north-south corridor will be selected by NHAI and ADB during implementation taking \ninto consideration lessons learnt from implementation of the zone under Loan 2029. The \nfindings and recommendations of the ongoing road safety audit study will also be incorporated \ninto the component design. The selected zone will be equipped with (i) an advanced traffic \nmanagement system to centrally monitor roads, (ii) weigh-in-motion or static weighing platforms \nto control overloading, (iii) speed-monitoring equipment, and (iv) ambulances and other relief \nequipment.  \n \n4.  HIV/AIDS and Human-Trafficking Awareness Component \n \n50.  This component will develop and implement a program to raise awareness of the risk of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking along project highways (Appendix 10). The component will (i) \nraise  awareness  of  HIV/AIDS  among  construction  workers  and  high-risk  groups,  and \ndisseminate information on early treatment; and (ii) raise awareness of human trafficking among \nvulnerable groups. The HIV/AIDS subcomponent will require close collaboration between NHAI \nand the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). The anti-trafficking subcomponent will \ndraw on knowledge and expertise from state departments of social welfare and women and \nchildren development.  \n \nC.  Cost Estimates \n51.  As shown in Table 1, the estimated total cost is $670.6 million equivalent, inclusive of \ntaxes, duties, commitment charges, and interest during implementation. Foreign exchange costs \nare estimated at $418.6 million (62.4%). Local currency costs are estimated at $252.0 million \nequivalent (37.6%).

Financing Plan \n52.  The Government has requested a loan of $400 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and \nsuch  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  The \nGovernment has provided ADB with the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and an undertaking that these \nchoices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or \nadvice from ADB. \n \n53.  ADB's loan proceeds will be used to finance all consulting services, and a portion of \npublic investment civil works and equipment. The Government will finance the foreign exchange \ncost of $39.5 million to cover commitment and interest charges. The Government will also \nfinance  local  currency  costs  of  $231.1  million  equivalent  to  cover  taxes  and  duties;  land \nacquisition, resettlement, and environmental works; a portion of public investment civil works \nand  equipment  expenditures;  and  in-kind  contributions  for  project  management.  The \nGovernment will promptly make loan proceeds available to NHAI. The Government uses a \ncurrent loan-grant ratio of 20:80. The Government will bear the loan\u2019s foreign exchange risk and \nany shortfall in finances during project implementation. \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Foreign Exchange  Local Currency  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  379.1  20.9  400.0  59.6 \nGovernment  39.5  231.1  270.6  40.4 \nTotal  418.6  252.0  670.6  100.0 \nSource: Staff estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n54.  The Executing Agency of the Project will be NHAI through the already established north-\nsouth corridor project management unit, headed by chief GMs of the north-south corridor, \nassisted by GMs and deputy GMs.  \n \n55.  For  the  institutional-strengthening  component,  the  GM  for  administration  will  be \nresponsible for day-to-day implementation. To further update highway standards and codes of \npractices,  a  steering  committee  chaired  by  MSRTH's  Department  of  Road  Transport  and \nHighways,  with  members  from  NHAI,  Department  of  Road  Transport  and  Highways,  and \nspecialists in road transport and highways will plan, program, review, and direct, the consultant's \nworks.  The  steering  committee  will  be  established  not  later  than  3  months  from  loan \neffectiveness. The consultant\u2019s recommendations will be presented to the steering committee \nfor approval by December 2005. Physical testing and piloting might be necessary. MSRTH will \nprocess the documents for publication by June 2008.  \n \n56.  Implementation arrangements for the highway development component are in Appendix \n12. Three PIUs will be established under the project management unit, in Lalitpur, Narsinghpur, \nand Anantpur. Each will be responsible for implementing about 150-250 km of roads. The PIU-", "12   \nNarsinghpur, in the middle of the project corridor, will implement three civil works contracts, and \ncoordinate overall project implementation. This PIU will be headed by a project director, at the \nGM/deputy  GM  level,  assisted  by  a  deputy  GM/manager  for  overall  management  and  a \nmanager for resettlement and environmental sisues. For each contract, a manager will be \nassigned.  \n \n57.  The PIU-Lalitpur will be responsible for four civil works contracts, and the PIU-Anantpur, \nfor all civil works contracts along NH7. Each PIU will be headed by a project director (at \nGM/deputy GM level), assisted by a deputy GM/manager for resettlement and environmental \nissues, and a manager for each contract package. \n \n58.  The road safety component will be implemented by the existing corridor management \nunit. A steering committee, established under the Loan 2029 (footnote 9), headed by the chief \nGM for corridor management and consisting of representatives of NHAI, MSRTH, and other \ncentral and state agencies, will oversee the implementation of this component. \n \n59.  For the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking component, the GM for estate management will be \nresponsible  for  overall  implementation  through  NHAI\u2019s  ESDU,  within  which  an  HIV/AIDS-\nprevention cell is being established to develop, implement, and monitor HIV/AIDS and anti-\ntrafficking interventions. The three PIUs will coordinate and monitor program execution, assisted \nby nongovernment organizations (NGOs), in close coordination with NACO and the state aids \ncontrol  societies,  Department  of  Women  and  Child  Development,  and  other  government \nagencies responsible for women and children empowerment.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n60.  The Project will be implemented over 4 years. NHAI ensures that most preconstruction \nactivities will be completed by March 2005. The Project, including the road safety component, is \nscheduled for completion in June 2008 (Appendix 13).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n61.  Procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \nand NHAI/Government\u2019s tender procedures acceptable to ADB. Civil works procurement will be \ncarried  out  under  international  competitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  among  prequalified \nbidders. The indicative contract packages are in Appendix 14. Supply contracts over $500,000 \nwill be procured under ICB; $100,000\u2013500,000, international shopping; and less than $100,000, \ndirect purchase arrangement. \n \n62.  To ensure project implementation readiness, as requested by the Government, ADB has \napproved advance procurement action. The Government has been advised that approval of \nadvance action does not commit ADB to finance the Project. A detailed schedule for civil works \nprocurement  has  been  prepared,  and  NHAI  agreed  to  strictly  follow  the  schedule \n(Supplementary Appendix E). Considering that the civil works are standard, and the works have \nbeen packaged to enable bidders to prepare their proposals quickly, the period for submission \nof prequalification applications is 45 days, and the bidding period, 60 days. \n     \n4.  Consulting Services \n63.  All consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic ", "    13\nconsultants.  To  ensure  project  implementation  readiness,  NHAI  has  started  selection  of \nconstruction supervision consultants. The Government has been advised that advance action \ndoes not commit ADB to finance the Project. \n \n64.  For the institutional-strengthening component, a team of consultants with expertise in \ninstitutional development, human resources management, highway planning, and engineering, \nwill be recruited using the simplified technical proposal requirement. The proposal period will be \n45 days, and the evaluation will be done under the quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) \nmethod. A team of international (24 person-months) and domestic consultants (50 person-\nmonths) will implement this component.  \n \n65.  For the highway development component, four consulting teams will be required for \nconstruction supervision, each handling about three civil works contracts. Each team will have a \nteam  leader;  resident  engineers;  pavement,  materials,  and  bridge  engineers;  road  safety, \nenvironmental, and resettlement specialists; and others (Appendix 15). For each team, an \ninternational firm associated with one or more domestic firms will be recruited using the full \ntechnical proposal requirement. The evaluation will be done under the QCBS method. The four \npackages will have a total of about 288 person-months\u2019 international and 4,487 person-months\u2019 \ndomestic inputs.  Considering that the supervision works are straight forward, the proposal \nperiod will be 45 days. \n \n66.  The road safety component will require about 24 person-months\u2019 domestic consulting \ninputs from three road safety individual specialists with expertise in enforcement, engineering, \nand evaluation. During the first 6 months, they will (i) assess road safety along the road safety \nzone;  (ii)  establish  a  road  safety  indicator  baseline;  (iii)  recommend  an  implementation \nmechanism and road safety solutions in road safety zone; (iv) propose road safety equipment, \nand help NHAI procure and install the equipment; (v) develop and train implementing and \nenforcement staff; and (vi) conduct monitoring and evaluation. \n \n67.  For the HIV/AIDS and anti-trafficking component, three domestic individual consultants \nwill help the HIV/AIDS cell design and implement a program to address HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking along the Project highways. Three NGOs, one for each PIU, will also be recruited to \nimplement the plan, in liaison with relevant agencies and departments as necessary. The NGOs \nwill also monitor the socioeconomic indicators along the project roads as indicated in the project \nperformance monitoring and evaluation system (Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n68.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January 2001) and Disbursement Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-based Loan \nProducts (July 2002), as amended from time to time. An imprest account will be established at \nthe Reserve Bank of India, with an initial advance equivalent to the estimated eligible project \nexpenditures for the next 6 months or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The imprest \naccount  will  be  established,  managed,  and  liquidated  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook, and detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. \nStatement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be used to replenish the imprest account for \nany individual payment under $300,000. \n ", "14   \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n69.  NHAI's  accounting  system  was  established  in  accordance  with  Government \nrequirements, and its financial statements are prepared in a format prescribed by the Controller \nand Auditor General of India, which audits NHAI's financial statements annually. As a public \nsector  authority,  the  system  generally  adheres  to  basic  commercial  accounting  practices \ncommonly employed in India. Accrual accounting is used, transactions are recorded on a \nhistorical-cost basis, and annual balance sheet and profit-and-loss statements are prepared. \n \n70.  NHAI and its PIUs will maintain separate project accounts. These and NHAI financial \nstatements  will  be  audited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  an \nindependent auditor acceptable to ADB. While the unaudited reports and financial statements \nwill be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year, the audited \nreports and financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months after the end \nof each fiscal year. The imprest account and SOE will be audited as part of the regular annual \naudit. The auditor\u2019s opinion of the examination of the imprest account and SOE should be \nseparately set out in the auditor\u2019s report. NHAI was made aware of ADB's policy on delayed \nsubmission and also of the importance of satisfactory and acceptable quality of audited reports. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n71.  Performance indicators to be monitored under the Project are (i) highway capacity, (ii) \nroad roughness, (iii) travel time, (iv) fatality rate, (v) freight rates, (vi) passenger fares, (vii) \norigins and destinations, (viii) freight types and volumes, (ix) air quality, and (x) local social \neconomies. The baseline values of NH26 and the outline method of data collection, compilation, \nand  analysis  of  these  indicators  are  in  Supplementary  Appendix  F.  The  same  baseline \nindicators for NH7 will be collected as part of the subproject proposal exercise. These indicators \nwill be monitored annually. NHAI, will set up a project performance management system within \n3  months  of  loan  effectiveness  and  with  assistance  of  project  construction  supervision \nconsultants  monitor  and  evaluate  the  Project\u2019s  benefits,  progress,  annually  during  Project \nimplementation and within three months of Project completion.   \n \n8.  Project Review \n72.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after the project loan effectiveness date, \nand regular reviews will follow annually. In 2006, the Project will require a detailed midterm \nreview by the Government and ADB to consider the Project\u2019s progress and agree upon any \nchanges to scope or implementation to achieve the project objectives.  \n \n73.  NHAI will monitor project preparation and implementation in accordance with the project \nprocessing and implementation schedule and time-bound milestones, and keep ADB informed \nof any significant deviations resulting in the milestones not being met. Assisted by consultants, \nNHAI will submit to ADB quarterly progress reports that include physical and financial progress, \nstatus of land acquisition, resettlement, environmental management, training, public campaigns, \nand  other  activities  critical  to  project  implementation  but  not  within  the  direct  scope  of \nengineering services. The report format will be developed during the inception mission. Within 3 \nmonths  of  physical  completion,  NHAI  will  submit  a  project  completion  report  in  a  format \nacceptable to ADB. \n ", "    15\nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Technical Aspects \n \n74.  The north-south corridor intersects the golden quadrilateral and the east-west corridor. \nLong distance traffic patterns will change due to shortened travel routes. The risk of increased \nroad accidents due to faster traffic will be mitigated through road safety audits during design and \nconstruction. The project highways will be upgraded from single- and double-lane roads to four-\nlane divided carriageways. The Project will provide for partial access control, segregation of \nslow traffic from fast, and traffic guidance and safety measures. Delays and hold-ups at railway \ncrossings  and  major  road  intersections  will  be  obviated.  Friction  due  to  slow  traffic,  and \nconsequent congestion and accidents, will be reduced considerably. The road safety zone will \nprovide a model for comprehensively reducing road accidents. Overall, the Project will improve \ntransport efficiency, speed up traffic, improve travel conditions, and reduce journey time and \nVOCs. The risk of delayed implementation has been mitigated by adopting advance action, \nestablishing PIUs early, and strengthening NHAI\u2019s project management functions.  \n \nB.  Policy and Institutional Aspects \n \n75.  The Project will facilitate NHAI's institutional strengthening and contribute to overall \ntransport efficiency, thus improving the returns and sustainability of investments in NHs and \nencouraging a wide range of other economic activities that make use of them. Overall, these will \nprovide efficient transport and contribute to economic growth.  \n \n76.  The adoption of the programmatic approach was a timely and sound initiative. Funding \nneeds to be predictable, and the approach provides a clear framework for ADB and other \nfinancial support, and for institutional and policy reform by the Government and NHAI.  \n \n77.  NHAI\u2019s institutional strengthening program  might not be completed on time, thereby \nleading to inadequate improvement in NHAI performance. This risk has been mitigated in the \nproject design by agreement with ADB on objectives to be achieved under the medium-term \ninstitutional-strengthening program. The institutional-strengthening component will help NHAI \nimplement the program and strengthen its project management capability. \n \nC.  Economic and Financial Aspects \n \n78.  The economic and financial analyses were carried out for the sample roads, consisting \nof 313 km on NH26 (Lalitpur-Lakhnadon) (Appendix 16), based on the assumptions listed in \nSupplementary Appendix G. The improved roads will ease and speed up traffic flow, and \nshorten travel time, resulting in lower VOCs.  \n \n79.  The economic analysis considers the estimated costs and benefits during construction \nand over 20 years of operation. The estimated costs consist of investment and incremental \noperating costs. The estimated benefits are savings in VOCs and passenger and cargo travel \ntime. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated at 14.9%. A sensitivity and risk \nanalysis  shows  that  the  Project  remains  economically  viable  as  the  EIRR  is  above  the \nopportunity cost of capital of 12%, except for the cases of 20% reduction in benefits and of 20% \nincrease in the Project\u2019s capital cost. The probability of the EIRR falling below 12% is 4.7%.  \n \n80.  The sample road was also evaluated to assess the projected toll revenues against \ncapital costs to improve and widen the road, and recurring costs for road operation and routine ", "16   \nand periodic maintenance over 20 years. The financial rate of return is calculated at 3.3%, \nbelow the Project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital in real terms at 4.6%. This implies that this \nsection is not commercially viable and that PSP will be possible only when financial support for \ninvestment is in the form of upfront lump-sum investment or annuity payment during the Project. \nToll revenues will, however, be able to cover recurring costs for road operation, including routine \nand periodic maintenance upon completion, which demonstrates that the project roads are \nfinancially sustainable with no further injection of national resources.  \n \nD.  Environmental Aspects \n \n81.  The Project is classified under category B in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines (2003).  Sagar-Rajmarg Chouraha section (98 km) has been selected \nas a sample project road as it  has a complex mountain forest section absent in other road \nsections. An initial environmental examination (IEE) for this section and a sector environmental \nassessment were carried out. The summary IEE, including the environmental management plan \n(EMP) is in Supplementary Appendix H. The reports  confirmed that no significant adverse \nenvironmental impacts are expected and that an environmental impact assessment is not \nrequired. Construction impacts will be mitigated in line with the EMP. Realignment, including \nbypasses,  will  prevent  impacts  on  cities,  settlements,  and  forests.  NHAI  will  ensure  that \nmitigation measures are implemented during construction and operation. For each subproject, \nan  IEE  and  EMP  will  be  prepared  following  the  environmental  assessment  and  review \nframework provided in Supplementary Appendix I. ADB will be given access to all environmental \nassessment documents.  \n \nE.  Social Aspects \n \n82.  A social impact assessment has been carried out along NH26, which is in Madhya \nPradesh and Uttar Pradesh. These states are among the poorest in the country, with poverty \nlevels at 37.06% and 31.22%, respectively, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27.09%. \nThe annual per capita income of those living below poverty line in these states is estimated at \nRs3,889.32 (less than $90). The Project will help spread the benefits of economic development \nby catalyzing forward-backward linkages, and will uplift the poor. The immediate project benefits \nfor the poor are skilled and unskilled jobs during project construction. In the long run, the Project \nwill augment the socioeconomic benefits and opportunities available to the poor. The summary \npoverty reduction strategy is in Appendix 17. \n \n83.  Lower transport costs will raise profit margins for poor farmers; encourage them to shift \nfrom  subsistence  to  commercial  agriculture;  and  lower  the  costs  and  increase  access  to \nschools, medical clinics, employment centers, and other social centers. \n \n84.  A distribution analysis estimated the poverty impact ratio by determining how much of \nthe benefits of the improved highways are passed on to the poor, based on the results of the \nfieldwork and economic analysis, use of the road by the poor and very poor via motorized \ntransit, and estimated degree of competition in the motorized passenger and freight transport \nmarkets. Approximately 50% of all bus passengers on the project roads are poor. The estimated \ndirect benefit is Rs15,655 million in present value terms. The net benefit to the economy as a \nwhole is Rs2,779 million. The poverty impact ratio is more than 1, indicating that the Project is \npro-poor since the total net economic benefits reaching the poor will exceed the Project\u2019s total \nnet economic benefits.  \n ", "    17\n85.  The project design  avoids residential areas as much as  possible, mainly by using \nbypasses, especially where religious places may have to be moved, and schools, clinics, and \nother common property facilities are close to the new alignments. Impacts due to diversions \nduring construction must also be identified and mitigation measures proposed. In accordance \nwith ADB's  Handbook on Resettlement: A Guide to Good Practice, a resettlement plan of \nLalitpur-Sagar (104 km) was prepared as a sample plan (Appendix 18) including the entitlement \nmatrix (Supplementary Appendix J). At this stage, an indigenous people development plan is \nnot warranted. For each subsequent subproject, a resettlement plan will be prepared in line with \nthe  resettlement  framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  K),  and  an  indigenous  people \ndevelopment plan will be prepared as necessary in accordance with the indigenous people \ndevelopment framework provided in Supplementary Appendix L.  \n \n86.  The risks associated with the improved highway network, such as increased incidence of \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking, are to be mitigated by raising awareness among high-risk and \nother vulnerable groups. \n \nV.

NHAI will \nconsult affected people during preparation, and disclose the plans to all \naffected people before land acquisition and resettlement and confirm that \nthese are posted on the ADB\u2019s website in a timely manner.  \n(vii)  NHAI  will  ensure  that  for  any  section  of  subproject  that  involves \nacquisition  of  land  passing  through  forest  land  and/  or  that  needs \ndiversification from use of forest land, relevant statutory clearances shall \nbe obtained under the Government\u2019s Forest Conservation Act, and Indian \nEnvironmental  Impact  Assessment  Notification,  1994,  prior  to \ncommencing civil works on that section.  \n(viii)  NHAI will, not later than 3 months of loan effectiveness, appoint an \nindependent monitoring agency for providing six monthly monitoring and \nevaluation reports on the implementation of RPs. Similarly, NHAI will \nestablish grievance redress committees in accordance with the RPs to \naddress  disputes  concerning  land  acquisition  and  resettlements, \nenvironment, and other social issues in a timely manner. \n(ix)  NHAI will ensure that civil works contracts under subprojects will provide \nthat contractors will carry out HIV/AIDS awareness, not use child labor, \nand will follow all applicable labor laws, including equal pay for equal \nwork. \n \n3.  Road Safety and HIV/AIDS  \n(i)  NHAI will audit road safety for the Project highways during subproject \ndesign, construction, and operations. \n(ii)  NHAI  will  monitor  and  annually  report  to  ADB,  incidents  of  traffic \naccidents on Project highways during project implementation and two \nyears after project completion.  \n(iii)  Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, the HIV/AIDs and anti-trafficking \ncell  in  NHAI,  assisted  by  consultants,  will  develop  and  implement  a \nprogram for preventing HIV/AIDS and promoting anti-trafficking along the \nproject highways, in close coordination with NACO, state AIDS control \nsocieties, and other responsible agencies.  ", "19 \nB.  Condition for Award of Civil Works Contracts \n \n88.  NHAI will not award civil works contracts under a subproject unless it has undertaken \napplicable safeguard requirements, acquired or made available the land and rights in land free \nfrom any encumbrances, and cleared any obstruction, from the related section, required to be \nhanded over to the contractor for commencement of construction in accordance with the work \nschedule as shall be agreed under the related civil works contract. \n \nC.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n \n89.  As a condition to the effectiveness of the Loan, NHAI will have invited bids in respect of \nnot less than 7 contract packages out of the 13 contract packages as specified in Appendix 14. \n \nD.  Amendments  to  Loan  Agreement  of  Loan  2029-IND: National  Highways Corridor \n  (Sector) I Project \n \n90.  With regard to adoption of tolling system, implementation target date of toll system and \nretention of tolls collected by NHAI, to provide the Government and NHAI realistic timeframes to \nachieve  these  activities,  the relevant  paragraphs  15  and  16  of  the  Loan Agreement for ADB  \nLoan  2029:  National  Highways  Corridor  (Sector)  I  Project  are  amended  in  accordance  with \nparagraphs 87.1 (iii) and (iv) and 87.2 (iv). \n \n \n \nVI.

Background \n \n1.  India  has  an  extensive  and  diverse  transport  system.  Road  transport  is  dominant, \naccounting for 60% of freight movement and 80% of passenger traffic; rail accounts for much of \nthe rest. The 10th Development Plan sets forth the following for the transport sector: (i) capacity \nexpansion to meet the increases in demand; (ii) reduction of disparities between and within \nstates,  including  integration  of  the  northeastern  states  into  the  economic  mainstream;  (iii) \ntechnology upgrading and modernization; (iv) improved maintenance of assets; (v) increased \nprivate  sector  participation;  (vi)  bringing  competition  into  infrastructure  development, \nmaintenance, and service provision to increase efficiency; (vii) emphasizing safety, energy \nefficiency, environmental conservation, and mitigation of social impacts; and (viii) improving the \nintermodal mix, in accordance with the comparative advantage of each mode. \n \nB.  Road Sector Management and Program \n \n2.  The responsibility for developing and maintaining the national highway (NH) system \nrests  with  the  central  Government's  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways \n(MSRTH),  while  state  and  district  roads  are  the  responsibility  of  the  state  and  local \ngovernments. Works on NHs were executed by the central Government and state public works \ndepartments under an agency system. To streamline and accelerate improvement works on the \nNHs,  the  National  Highways  Authority  of  India  (NHAI)  was  created  in  1988  and  made \noperational in 1995. It is responsible for major upgrading of the NH network, through the \nNational  Highways  Development  Program  (NHDP),  which  includes  (i)  NHDP-I: the golden \nquadrilateral (about 6,000 kilometer [km]); and (ii) NHDP-II: the north-south corridor (about \n4,000 km), and east-west corridor (about 3,300 km). Recently the Government launched NHDP-\nIII, consisting of a 10,000 km NHs to integrate the regions, to be implemented by NHAI. NHDP-\nIII covers high-density traffic corridors, state capitals links to NHDP-I and NHDP-II network, and \nroads providing access to economic and tourist centers. \n \nC.  Road Network, Traffic, and Vehicle Fleet \n \n3.  The network of national, state district, and rural roads totals some 3.4 million km, of \nwhich only 65,569 km are NHs.13 The network grew 8.5 times, from 400,000 km in 1951. Road \ndensity is now 1 km/km2, which is higher than in many developing countries. However, the \nstandards and conditions of the road network are inadequate to meet rapidly growing demand \nfor freight and passenger traffic. In early 2004, 31% of NHs were 1.0\u20131.5 lane, 63% were 2.0-\nlane, and 6% were 4.0-lane or higher. Over 50% of national and state highways, and more of \nother roads, are in bad condition.  \n \n4.  NHs carry about 40% of total road traffic. Over the last decade, passenger traffic grew \n7.8% per year, and freight traffic by 7.6% per year, while the growth rate of growth domestic \nproduct (GDP) was 6.0%. Traffic is projected to grow faster than GDP, which is typical in the \nearly stages of motorization, and can be expected to continue. \n \n5.  The vehicle fleet totaled some 59 million units in 2002. Buses account for 1%, trucks for \n5%, cars and jeeps for 13%, and motorcycles for 71%. Auto-rickshaws (three-wheelers) and \n                                                 \n13   The network of national roads totaled 58,112 km until February 2004, when 7,457 km were added. \n ", "  Appendix 2  23\nagricultural tractors and other vehicles made up the remaining 10%. Over the past 10 years, the \ncar fleet has been growing at approximately 9.0% per year, while heavy commercial vehicles \ngrew at 7.6% per year.  \n \n6.  In 1947, the Government began to protect the domestic automobile manufacturing \nindustry. To stimulate production of more fuel-efficient, safer, better-quality, affordable vehicles, \nthe protection policy was eased. Deregulation started with two-wheelers in the mid-1980s, \nfollowed by passenger cars and commercial vehicles in the 1990s. In FY2001, 4.75 million \nmotor vehicles were manufactured, a 155% increase over FY1992.  \n  \nD.  Road Freight Services \n \n7.  Provision  of  road  freight  services  is  a  private  sector  activity.  Market  entry  is  not \nrestricted. While the Motor Vehicle Act requires prospective truck operators to obtain a permit, \nregional transport authorities usually grant permits to all applicants. So, in effect the permit \nsystem is used to facilitate collection of state motor vehicle taxes rather than to economically or \ntechnically regulate trucking operations. Motor vehicle taxes are estimated to account for nearly \n10% of state revenue.  \n \n8.  While the Motor Vehicle Act grants state governments the authority to set freight rates, \nthey  rarely  do  so.  Thus,  in  practice  freight  rates  are  not  regulated,  resulting  in  intense \ncompetition among truckers and in passing on of reductions in vehicle operating costs (VOCs) \nfrom improved road conditions to buyers of freight services. \n \n9.  About 77% of truck operators have fleets of no more than five trucks. Most are family \nbusinesses. Truck operators with fleets of more than 20 vehicles account for only 6% of the \ntotal, and many use trucks owned by other people, in part to avoid being subject to the Motor \nTransport Workers Act, which limits truckers\u2019 work day to 8 hours. Large fleet operators typically \nhave a network of branches with 12\u201315% of their activity handled by their own trucks, and the \nrest provided by smaller truck operators or brokers. \n \n10.  The trucking industry\u2019s efficiency is hampered by several factors: (i) small scale of \noperations, low profitability, and lack of credit, which all contribute to underinvestment in high-\nperformance  trucks  and  result  in  a  high  proportion  of  overage  vehicles;  (ii)  low  level  of \ntransparency associated with the fragmented nature of the market, which impedes the full \nexploitation of potential for backhaul cargo; (iii) lack of sufficient and adequate loading and \nunloading facilities, preventing transshipment from larger to smaller trucks, which is often \nneeded in the periphery of major cities that have truck bans. \n \nE.  Road Passenger Transport Services \n \n11.  Road passenger transport services are provided by the public and private sectors, but \nthe share of the public sector has been declining. While the public sector operated 45% of the \nnumber of vehicles in 1980, its share declined to 21% in 1999. Road passenger transport is \nsubject  to  economic,  safety,  and  environmental  regulation.  Economic  regulation  is  the \nresponsibility of the state transport authorities, which control market entry by issuing operating \nlicenses  that  cover  the  service  requirements  (e.g.,  scope  of  business  operations).  The \nauthorities also regulate passenger fares, which are kept low by political pressure. Safety and \nenvironmental regulation is handled by regional transport authorities. They are responsible for \nregistering vehicles, carrying out safety inspections of vehicles, issuing licenses to professional \ndrivers and conductors, and carrying out inspections of emissions. \n ", " 24 Appendix 2 \n \n12.  State road transport undertakings (SRTUs) serve villages, towns, and cities. Until the \n1980s, SRTUs dominated passenger transport service. However, owing to a policy of opening \nup the market to the private sector, their dominance has been declining. By 2000, SRTUs \nowned 118,000 vehicles, while the private sector owned 440,000. Private sector operators own \nsmaller vehicles, including tricycles, and are mostly active in the urban areas.    \n \n13.  Competition is limited in passenger transport. As fares are regulated and most publicly \nowned operators are not covering their costs, only part of the reductions in vehicle operating \ncosts from road improvements will be passed on to passengers. Nevertheless, the economy as \na whole will gain from such reductions.  \n \nF.  Road Expenditures and Revenues \n \n14.  The central Government funds NH development and maintenance from general taxation, \nwhile state governments fund state highways and major district and rural roads. From the \nDevelopment  Plan  (1980-1985)  to  the  9th  Development  Plan  (1997-2002),  road  sector \nallocations  increased  11-fold,  from  Rs39  billion  to  Rs475  billion,  while  transport  sector \nallocations  increased  about  seven-fold.  The  road  sector\u2019s  share  in  total  transport  sector \nallocations increased from about 28% in the 6th Development Plan to about 40% in the 9th \nDevelopment Plan, reflecting the Government\u2019s commitment to improve highway infrastructure \nto meet the demands of the growing economy and to reduce poverty. \n \n15.  Revenue collected by the central Government consists of import and excise duties on \nmotor vehicles and accessories, tires and tubes, and motor fuel. State revenue consists of \nmotor  vehicle  taxes  and  fees,  sales  tax  on  motor  spirits  and  lubricants,  and  taxes  on \npassengers and goods. Total expenditures on roads are estimated to be no higher than 50% of \nrevenues collected from the road transport sector. Part of the excise duty (\u201ccess\u201d) on motor fuel, \nwhich is set at a fixed amount per liter, is channeled into the Central Road Fund (CRF). The \nGovernment revamped the fund by increasing the cess to Rs1 per liter for petrol and diesel in \n1999. A further increase to Rs.1.50 per liter was effected in February 2003, which is expected to \nraise Rs90 billion ($2 billion) per annum. These funds are allocated to the different road classes \naccording to a fixed formula stated in the CRF Act of 2000: (i) 50% of the cess on high-speed \ndiesel to develop rural roads; and (ii) 50% of the high-speed diesel plus 100% of petrol for NHs \nand state highways as follows: 57.5% for development and maintenance of NHs, 30% for \ndevelopment and maintenance of state roads, and 12.5% for road bridges under or over railway \nlines  and  for  safety  work  on  rail  crossings.  The  revenues  accruing  to  NHs  are  intended \nexclusively to implement the NHDP. Budgetary grants are used to fund the construction of non-\nNHDP national roads and the maintenance of the national network. \n \nG.  Maintenance \n \n16.  The Government\u2019s approach to maintenance of NHs under NHAI relies heavily on two \npolicies: (i) raising additional funds for maintenance, mainly through tolling; and (ii) securing \ngreater  private  sector  involvement  to  maintain  the  roads.  As  more  and  more  roads  are \ncompleted under the NHDP, these policies, when properly implemented, should go a long way \nto  improving  network  funding  and  implementation.  Adequate  maintenance  requires  (i) \nestablishment of a comprehensive pavement management system for NHs so that funds can be \njudiciously allocated; and (ii) development of a planning, programming, and budgeting system \nthat treats highway expenditures comprehensively, based on a detailed assessment of all \nrequirements  for  all  roads,  starting  with  routine  and  periodic  maintenance,  and  including \n ", "  Appendix 2  25\nimprovement and upgrading works, bridge improvement and strengthening, and major capacity \nexpansion.  \n \n17.  Concessions  for  corridor  management  signed  with  private  sector  parties  make  the \nconcessionaire responsible for several functions, including toll collection. Two pilot schemes are \nunder implementation, and new schemes that incorporate lessons of experience are under \ndevelopment. A road information system, which has been under development for some time \nwith World Bank financing, is an important step toward an appropriate pavement management \nsystem. These initiatives should be pursued vigorously so that new policies can begin to be \nimplemented as and when successive NHDP links are being completed.  \n \nH.  Private Sector Participation \n \n18.  Since the economic reforms in 1991, the Government has actively promoted private \nsector financing and management of traditionally public sector activities. The NHAI Act of 1988 \nempowers the authority to enter into any contract to discharge its functions. In 1995, the \nNational Highways Act of 1956 was amended to (i) empower the central Government to enter \ninto a contract with any private person to develop and maintain an NH or part thereof; (ii) allow \nthe person to collect and retain fees for the use of an NH, subject to agreement and at rates \nspecified by the central Government; and (iii) allow the person to regulate and control traffic on \nan NH. In 1997, MSRTH issued guidelines for PSP in NHs. These were also supported by \npolicy measures to facilitate PSP: (i) according tax incentives to investors in road infrastructure; \n(ii) ensuring NHAI facilitation in relation to all construction preparatory activities, including land \nacquisition and removal of utilities; (iii) enabling NHAI to provide grants of up to 40% of the \nproject cost; (iv) allowing foreign direct investment of up to 100% of equity; and (v) allowing \nduty-free import of construction equipment. \n \n19.  A total of 15 PSP projects have been signed on NH-8 as annuity concessions and 7 as  \nbuild-operate-transfer (BOT) concessions. Ten contracts were also signed under the modality of \nspecial-purpose vehicle. Annuity and toll-based BOT concessions have offered efficiency gains, \nparticularly as improved road quality and availability. The schemes have proved successful in \ntransferring the initial financing, construction, and O&M risks to the private sector. These \nefficiency gains need to be considered in estimating the cost of public vis-\u00e0-vis private sector \ninvestment in the NHDP.  \n \n20.  Large and certain traffic volumes are a precondition for toll-based BOT concessions. \nThis precondition was present in the golden quadrilateral but not in most other highways. \nConsequently, annuity concessions become the preferred modality for PSP. However, traffic \nrisk should be transferred to the private sector. The annuity and BOT concessions have been \nsmall, which is not ideal for O&M. Therefore, (i) other PSP approaches and modalities should be \nexplored  to  mitigate  traffic  risk  and  reduce  the  financing  cost,  and  (ii)  larger  PPP  O&M \nconcessions designed and tested. \n ", " 26 Appendix 3 \nNATIONAL HIGHWAYS AUTHORITY OF INDIA\u2019S FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND \nSUSTAINABILITY \n \nA.  Financial Management \n \n1.  The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) was established under the NHAI \nAct  of  1988  to  develop  and  manage  national  highways  (NHs).  NHAI  is  responsible  for \nimplementing the National Highway Development Program Phase I and Phase II (NHDP-I and \nNHDP-II), consisting of 13,300 kilometer [km] of NHs, in 1998\u20132007.1  \n \n2.  NHAI\u2019s annual financial requirements are submitted to the Ministry of Shipping, Road \nTransport and Highways (MSRTH), forming part of its budget, and approved by Parliament. \nNHAI prepares the budget for each program, segment, package, and activity (e.g., construction \nsupervision, land acquisition, etc) for each quarter. NHAI monitors budget execution at various \nlevels. The project implementation unit (PIU) prepares the physical and financial progress report \nfor projects regularly, and submits to the head office (i) a quarterly fund use report, fund \nrequirement, trial balance, and bank reconciliation statement; and (ii) a monthly expenditure \nstatement.  \n \n3.  PIUs pay for project construction, except for the contractors\u2019 mobilization advance \nbill, which is settled and paid by the head office. It transfers funds to the PIUs monthly based on \nthe quarterly budget and on actual expenditures in the monthly statement. NHAI\u2019s physical and \nfinancial performance is also monitored by the task force under the Prime Minister\u2019s Office and \nPlanning Commission. \n \n4.  NHAI\u2019s accounting system is in accordance with Government requirements, and \nNHAI\u2019s financial statements follow the format prescribed by the Comptroller and Auditor General \nof India (CAG),  which audits NHAI\u2019s financial statements annually. However, these do not \nprovide sufficient information to evaluate NHAI\u2019s financial structure or performance. Nor is \nNHAI\u2019s  accounting  system  adequate  to  manage  the  agency\u2019s  resources.  NHAI  lacks  the \nintegrated physical and financial planning and management systems and integrated accounting \nand financial reporting systems to provide timely information to management or to efficiently \nmanage the agency\u2019s resources or cash flow.14 \n \n5.  CAG\u2019s audit and certification of NHAI\u2019s financial statements are usually pending \nabout 8 months following their submission. NHAI thus appointed an external auditor, acceptable \nto the Asian Development Bank, to conduct internal auditing effective in FY2002.  \n \nB.  Financial Performance \n6.  NH development and management are two major NHAI operations. Development \nexpenditure is treated as capital investment and is thus not included in NHAI\u2019s operating \nexpenses, while operation and maintenance (O&M) are a recurrent operating expense that \nshould  be  included  in  NHAI\u2019s  income  statement.  As  this  expenditure  does  not  comprise \noperating expenses in the income statement, but is offset against the toll collection that is \ncredited in the balance sheet as a payable to the Government, the income statement not an \nadequate basis to assess NHAI financial performance. \n                                                 \n1  Recently, another 10,000 km of NHs (NHDP-III) have been entrusted to NHAI. Since the financial plan for implementing \nNHDP-III has not been developed, this analysis is limited to NHAI's responsibility for the NHDP-I and NHDP-II. \n14  The Asian Development Bank has provided technical assistance to strengthen NHAI\u2019s financial management capacity. \n ", "  Appendix 3  27 \n7.  NHAI financial performance may be measured through budgetary monitoring. Should \nNHAI become financially autonomous in the long term, with the right to retain toll revenue, the \nonly viable parameter to evaluate financial performance will be NHAI\u2019s profit. NHAI\u2019s income \nstatement should be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards. An \nincome statement that reflects NHAI\u2019s profitability is also essential to raise funds from bond \nmarkets.  \n \nC.  Financial Sustainability \n \n8.  NHAI projects that the NHDP-I and NHDP-II will cost $15.1 billion over 10 years. \nNHAI  will  raise  $33.8  billion  from  various  funding  sources.  The  balance  of  $18.7  billion \nrepresents debt servicing. Major sources of financing are (i) $17.7 billion from a levy on petrol \nand diesel fuel (52.4%), (ii) $10.7 billion from financial markets (31.7%), (iii) $3.6 billion through \nexternal assistance (10.7%), and (iv) $1.8 billion through private sector participation (5.3%).  \n \n9.  NHAI\u2019s cash-flow projection does not consider toll collections as a source of funds \nbecause these are remitted to the Government. However, NHAI's right to retain them will be \nsanctioned by December 2004, and they will become a major source of funds. O&M expenditure \nwill comprise a major cash outflow for NHAI in the long term. Once toll collections become part \nof NHAI\u2019s revenue, the need for market borrowings will be substantially reduced from $10.8 \nbillion to $5.0 billion. An additional $3.0 billion will be needed from the market during 2004-2008, \ncompared with the $9.0 billion that NHAI projects, which is feasible considering NHAI\u2019s track \nrecord of raising $1.9 billion for 1999-2003 at an average interest rate of 8.2%. \n \nTable A3: Cash Flow Projection, including Toll Revenue \n ($ million) \nItem  FY1999\u20132003  FY2004\u20132008  FY2009\u20132014  FY2015\u20132019  Total \nSource of Funds:           \nFuel Levy  1,849  4,039  5,805  5,979  17,672 \nMarket Borrowing  1,585  3,440  0  0  5,025 \nExternal Assistance  971  2,598  0  0  3,569 \nPrivate Sector Participation  629  1,166  0  0  1,795 \nToll Revenue  87  1,691  4,839  6,190  12,807 \nManagement Fee  22  71  1  1  95 \nTotal  5,143  13,005  10,645  12,170  40,963 \nUse of Funds:           \nCapital Works  3,884  11,263  0  0  15,147 \nDebt Servicing  145  2,469  7,272  1,393  11,279 \nCorridor Management  171  843  2,564  2,649  6,227 \nAdministrative Expense  16  70  113  117  316 \nTotal  4,216  14,645  9,949  4,159  32,969 \nNet  927  (1,640)  696  8,011  7,994 \n \n \n10.  Should NHAI become financially autonomous, toll revenue must reach the projected \nlevel. The sensitivity analysis shows that a 50% reduction in toll revenue will make it difficult in \nthe long term for NHAI to recover its basic operating expenses for corridor management and for \nadministration. To ensure its financial sustainability, NHAI should be allowed to formally retain \nand spend toll collections. \n ", " \nNHAI: MEDIUM-TERM INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FRAMEWORK  \n \n2\n8\nSubject  Objectives   \n \n\u2022  Develop a new organizational structure based on the two core businesses\u2014project and corridor management  A\nOrganizational    pp\ne\nStructure  n\nd\n  \u2022  Establish technical review functions   ix 4\nProject  \u2022  Update highway standards and code of practice   \nManagement \n\u2022  Define work load and skill mix requirements of the project implementation unit \n(implementation \n\u2022  Develop an internal rating system of contractors and consultants \nfunction)  \u2022  Develop a NHDP-III program implementation mechanism  \n \n\u2022  Finalize a contract agreement for developing a pilot corridor management activity \nCorridor \n\u2022  Review the O&M study for Surat-Manor and an O&M implementation plan \nManagement \n\u2022  Commence a tolling system study \n(O&M)  \u2022  Develop a tolling system for corridor management on national highways \n  \u2022  Implement a road safety zone in north-south corridor  \n\u2022  Review and recommend a road safety system based on the findings of the road safety audit \n\u2022  Integrate the tolling system and road safety concept into a corridor management concept \n \n\u2022  Determine the optimal proportion of permanent staff required \nHuman \n\u2022  Assess skill-mix requirements for core functions \nResources \n\u2022  Establish a permanent officer cadre at levels to achieve optimal organizational efficiency \n\u2022  Develop policies and procedures on (i) recruitment;

Introduction \n1.  The consultant\u2019s responsibilities will include, but not be limited to, providing management \nand technical specialists to work directly with staff of the National Highways Authority of India \n(NHAI)  to  (i)  help  it  achieve  the  objectives  of  its  institutional  strengthening  program,  (ii) \nstrengthen project management, and (iii) update highway standards and the code of practices.   \n \n2.  Facilitating the Implementation of NHAI's Institutional Strengthening Program. The \nconsultant will help NHAI carry out its institutional strengthening activities, including planning, \ncoordination, monitoring and evaluation. The objectives of the action plan (Appendix 4) will \ncover (i) organizational structure, (ii) project management, (iii) corridor management, (iv) human \nresources,  (v)  information  technology  and  system,  and  (vi)  financial  management  and \nprogramming. \n \n3.  Strengthening Project Management Function. The consultant will evaluate the project \nmanagement  function  of  NHAI  in  the  golden  quadrilateral,  including  lessons  learned  and \nrecommendations to improve effectiveness. The consultant will assess the existing project \nmanagement-related workload and, based on NHAI\u2019s experience in the golden quadrilateral, \nestimate the staff resources and skill mix needed to efficiently fulfill NHAI's expanding mandate. \nThe consultant will also prescribe and lay down procedures and forms for procuring different \nservices, e.g., construction contracts, consultant contracts, PPP and O&M concessions, etc. \n \n4.  Updating Highway Standards and Code of Practices. Since 1999, modern highways \nhave been designed and constructed, and a large program of highway development is in the \npipeline.  Planning,  design,  construction,  and  operation  of  roads  are  generally  based  on \nestablished standards and codes of practice, prepared and published by the Indian Roads \nCongress.  For  specific  application,  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road  Transport  and  Highways \n(MSRTH) and NHAI also issue instructions and guidelines from time to time. However, some \nstandards require updating and rationalization to be compatible with the ground situation and \ncurrent international practice, and new standards or codes on certain critical aspects need to be \ndeveloped  to  modernize  highway  development.  The  review  may  cover  traffic,  capacity, \ngeometric,  pavement,  expressway  design,  performance-related  maintenance,  public-private \npartnership, road safety, and other aspects, and will be implemented in two stages. \n \n5.  Stage I will cover the following:    \n \n(a)  Review the existing standards and codes of practice in the context of ground \nconditions and establish the need to update them and prepare new ones;  \n(b)  List the standards and codes requiring update, based on discussions with the \nsteering committee;  \n(c)  Organize a workshop for the focus group; and \n(d)  Develop a detailed work plan to review and update the list of standards and \ncodes, and estimate the inputs and time schedule. \n \n6.  Stage II will cover the following: \n \n(a)  For the approved subjects, update and revise the standards, code, and manual, \nalong with explanatory notes on the justification for and impacts of the revision; \n ", "  Appendix 6  31\n(b)  Submit  the  revised  and  updated  drafts  through  the  steering  committee  for \napproval; and \n(c)  After the steering committee approves the drafts, consolidate a detailed report on \nall the consultant\u2019s activities, the collected data and analysis thereof, and the \njustification for updating or developing standards and code, including a copy of \nthese as approved by the steering committee and in a form suitable for quick \nprocessing by the Indian Road Congress for publication as a national standard. \n  \nB.  Implementation Arrangement \n7.  The  overall  implementation  of  this  component  will  be  coordinated  by  the general \nmanager (administration), who will be responsible for day-to-day implementation. With regard to \nthe update of highway standards and the code of practices, a steering committee chaired by \nMSRTH,  with  members  drawn  from  NHAI,  MSRTH,  focus  groups,  and  specialists  in  the \nconcerned areas, will be constituted to plan, program, review, direct, and approve the findings of \nthis subcomponent. The recommendations prepared by the consultant, who will be engaged not \nlater than 4 months of loan effectiveness, will be presented to the steering committee for \napproval. Physical testing and piloting might be necessary. The documents will be processed \nthrough MSRTH for publication as national standards by June 2008. \n \n \n.\n ", "32  Appendix 7  \nDESIGN FEATURES AND TECHNICAL STANDARDS \n \n \n1.  The Project includes widening and upgrading of 566 kilometer (km) stretches into four-\nlane highways consisting 313 km from Lalitpur to Lakhnadon and 252 km from Kurnool to \nAndhra Pradesh/Karnataka Border along the north-south corridor. The project road sections \nhave single- to two-lane carriageway configurations, with flexible pavement in fair to poor \ncondition. Most of the bridges are old and narrow and many are submersible. The road passes \nthrough plain or mildly rolling terrain with small stretches negotiating a hilly section.  \n \n2.  The design criteria are in accordance with the latest guidelines and circulars of the \nMinistry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways (MSRTH), and publications of the Indian \nRoads Congress and Bureau of Indian Standards. For aspects not covered by the last two \nagencies\u2014as for comparative evaluation of optimizing critical components such as pavements, \ninterchanges,  etc.\u2014international  standards  such  as  those  of  the  American,  British,  and \nAustralian standards, among others, have been adopted as appropriate. \n \n3.  A detailed description of the design approach is as follows: \n \n(i)  Cross  section.  The  highway  cross-section  has  a  dual  carriageway  of  7.25 \nmeters (m), including a 0.25 m kerb shyness, each with 1.50 m paved shoulder \nand 1.00 m unpaved shoulder. A median width of 4.5 m is provided, which could \nbe increased in short stretches up to 12.0 m to save avenues of large trees, or \nreduced to 1.2 m in difficult hilly or built-up areas. The standard roadway width is \n24 m, and the bridges will be wide enough to carry through the carriageways and \nshoulders in each direction, which follow the MSRTH design guidelines for a four-\nlane divided carriageway. \n \n(ii)  Right-of-way. A right of way of 60 m will be provided in conformity with MSRTH \nguidelines, and to reduce roadside friction. \n \n(iii)  Design speed. For plain terrain, the ruling and minimum design speeds are 100 \nand 80 km/hour (hr), respectively, and for rolling terrain, 80 and 65 km/hr. \n \n(iv)  Pavement design. Widening the carriageways will require 200\u2013250 millimeter \n(mm) granular sub-base, 200\u2013250 mm wet mix macadam, 80\u2013150 mm dense \nbituminous macadam, and 40\u201350 mm bituminous concrete as per requirements \nof specific sections. Similarly, strengthening the carriageway will require dense \nbituminous macadam varying from 100 to 150 mm, and 40\u201350 mm bituminous \nconcrete. \n \n(v)  Bypasses. To avoid densely built-up areas in villages and towns, bypasses are \nproposed, particularly for Lalitpur (6.9 km), Babina (5.6 km), Sagar (26.0 km), \nPemukonda (9 km), Ulindakonda (11.5 km), and Gooty (12 km). The Lalitpur \nbypass is already of two-lane  standard  and  will  be  upgraded  to  a  four-lane \ndivided carriageway under the Project. The bypasses will also have a right of way \nof 60 m and parallel service roads where warranted. Land boundaries will be \nfenced.  \n \n(vi)  Bridges.  The  Project  includes  reconstruction  to  four-lane  standard  of  all \nsubmersible bridges and widening of other bridges in good condition. \n ", "  Appendix 7 33\n   \n \n(vii)  Drainage. The Project will provide drainage and protection against erosion. At \nhigh-embankment locations, a system of kerb and chute will dispose of surface \nwater. \n \n4.  The following safety and roadside features will also be incorporated into the highway \ndesign: \n \n(i)  A high degree of access control will be provided through grade separators, \nrailway over bridges, underpasses, and fencing. At busy cattle-crossing points, \n2.5 m x 3.5 m box-type structures will be constructed to serve as cattle passes. \n \n(ii)  Bus stops with passenger shelters will be constructed. The designs will provide \nfor 5 m-wide stopping bays and raised footways so that passengers can safely \nexit and enter buses.  \n \n(iii)  Truck  lay-bys  will  be  constructed  at  traditional  truck  parking  and  loading  & \nunloading locations. These parking lay-bys will provide access routes on and off \nthe main highway, and will be sized to accommodate the need of each location. \n \n(iv)  Guard rail or crash barrier will be constructed at high-embankment (height > 3 m) \nlocations and at approaches to bridges. \n \n(v)  Service roads of a carriageway width of 7.0 m or 5.5 m, separated from the main \nhighway carriageway by a drain, will be constructed in urban and built-up areas \nto segregate slow-moving local traffic from fast-moving traffic on the highway. \nThese service roads, besides effecting access control, will serve the needs of the \nlocal communities and settlements along the highway. \n \n(vi)  The geometrics of the road, including all junctions, will be improved to provide \nturning radius, road markings, traffic signs, traffic signal controls at major urban \njunctions, etc. Urban roads will have footpaths, pedestrian crossings and railings, \ncovered drains, etc. \n ", "34  Appendix 8 \nSUBPROJECT REQUIREMENTS AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES \n \nA.

Statistics of the National AIDS15 Control Organization (NACO) for 2001 show that India \nhas close to 4 million HIV-16infected people, the  highest in the region. As of August 2003, \nMadhya Pradesh had 1,024 officially reported  cases of infection, and Uttar Pradesh, 1,083. \nTraffic on National Highway (NH) 26 is not very dense, and it has few rest areas. However, with \nthe  improvement  of  NH26,  traffic  volume  (mainly  trucks)  is  likely  to  increase,  which  may \nintensify  commercial  sex  activities  at  the  rest  areas  used  by  truck  drivers  and  helpers, \nencouraging transmission of the AIDS virus, and human trafficking. \n \n2.  The environment and social development unit within the National Highways Authority of \nIndia (NHAI) will establish an HIV/AIDS cell to implement and monitor anti-HIV/AIDS and anti-\ntrafficking interventions. Assisted by the World Bank, a framework (action plan) for the cell, \nincluding its resource requirements, is being prepared. The Project will help the cell (i) design \nand implement a program to combat HIV/AIDS along the project highways (NH26 and NH7). \nThe Project will also help NHAI monitor socioeconomic performance indicators along these \nhighways (as indicated in Supplementary Appendix F). \n \n3.  Strategies.  The  program  will  (i)  combat  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  through \nmultifaceted programs, and (ii) establish modes of operation and procedures to mitigate and \nprevent AIDS and trafficking along the highway corridor. \n \n4.  Combating HIV/AIDS. The subcomponent will be built upon the collaborative model \ndeveloped between NHAI and NACO. Key areas of activities include the following: \n(i)  Orient and sensitize project personnel on HIV/AIDS. \n(ii)  Raise awareness of HIV/AIDS among contractors and construction workers by \ndistributing referral information and condoms.  \n(iii)  Launch a public awareness campaign to change the behavior of high-risk groups, \nusing the media, and information, education, and communication (IEC) materials.  \n(iv)  Visit high-risk groups (e.g., truck drivers and helpers, sex workers, scheduled \ncastes  and  tribes,  road-side  construction  workers)  at  key  spots  (road-side \nrestaurants,  brothels,  rest  areas,  hospitals,  and  clinics)  and  change  their \nbehavior by distributing condoms.  \n(v)  Provide  information  on  the  nearest  services  for  testing,  counseling,  and \ntreatment. \n \n5.  Preventing  Human  Trafficking.  Drawing  on  knowledge  and  expertise  from  state \ndepartments of social welfare and women and children development, the key areas of activities \ninclude:  \n(i)  Sensitize and build the capacity of project personnel on human trafficking issue. \n(ii)  Raise public awareness through the media and IEC materials, especially among \nsex workers, scheduled castes and tribes, migrant women, working children, and \nwomen working in construction sites. Target key hot spots (road-side restaurants, \nrest  areas,  cross-border  check  points,  and  brothels),  and  change  people\u2019s \nbehavior by stressing, for example, that child sex is a crime, family values are \nimportant, women and children need to be respected, etc. Protect potential \n                                                 \n15  Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. \n16  Human immunodeficiency virus. \n ", "38  Appendix 10  \nvictims from job and marriage scams, and give them tips on safe migration, and \nhot lines, police numbers, and other information. \n(iii)  Link up with the many Government programs to empower women and children. \nDesign programs based on communities\u2019 needs, and ensure that resources are \nchanneled  to  the  targeted  communities  in  cooperation  with  the  states\u2019 \ndepartments of women and child development.  \n \n6.  Social Economic Indicators Monitoring. HIV/AIDS incidence and other socioeconomic \nindicators as provided in Supplementary Appendix F, including income level, source of income, \nliteracy profile, and accessibility and mobility, along the project highways will be monitored \nannually. \n \n7.  Implementation  Arrangements.  This  component  will  be  for  3  years.  Project \nimplementation  units  (PIUs),  assisted  by  the  supervision  consultants,  will  coordinate  and \nmonitor the day-to-day execution of the program through nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \nThe HIV/AIDS cell, assisted by the three domestic consultants, will (i) design and implement a \nprogram for the project highways; (iii) prepare Terms of Reference for and recruit three NGOs to \nimplement the program; and (iv) supervise, monitor, and evaluate program of implementation \nand NGO performance. The NGOs will work closely with the state AIDS control societies, \nthrough  which  NACO  will  provide  technical  support,  material,  and  training  to  the  project \nimplementation units (PIUs), NGOs, and NHAI staff.  \n \n8.  Monitoring and Reporting.

The Project will upgrade about 566 kilometers (km) of selected national highways (NHs) \nto be operated as toll roads, particularly the north-south corridor. Approximately 313 km on \nNH26,  between  Lalitpur  to  Lakhnadon,  were  selected  for  sample  economic  and  financial \nanalysis.  \n \nA.  Summary Economic Analysis \n \n2.  The economic evaluation of the sample roads was done by using the highway and \ndesign maintenance model (HDM-4). The benefits to road users were estimated by comparing \nthe differences between costs in the without- and with-project cases. Project roads will be \nupgraded to dual two-lane carriageways, resulting in reduced vehicle operating costs (VOCs), \nwhich will stimulate economic growth. The model compared the annual streams of economic \ncapital and operating costs and benefits, and computes the net present value (NPV) and the \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR). All costs and benefits were expressed in 2004 constant \nprices. The analysis covers the construction period and 20 years of operation.  \n \n1.  Road Condition and Traffic \n3.  Road  Condition.  The  road  condition  has  been  investigated  through  topographic, \npavement condition, and roughness surveys. Based on traffic flow and pavement condition, the \nsample  road  was  divided  into  four  homogeneous  sections.  Surface  roughness  levels,  in \naccordance with the international roughness index (IRI), for each section are shown in Table \nA16.1.  \n \nTable A16.1: Sample Project Road Condition \nRoad   Description  Distance   Average Roughness  \nSection  (km)  IRI, m/km \n1  Lalitpur-Sagar   106.0   6.0 \n2  Sagar-Rajmarg Chauraha  98.0   9.0 \n3  Rajmarg ChaurahaLakhnadon  109.7  10.0 \nIRI = international roughness index, km = kilometer, m = meter. \nSource: Feasibility Study report. \n \n4.  Traffic Volume. Traffic volume on the project road was measured at various locations. \nEach traffic count was for 7 days. Origin-destination counts were also done at some traffic \nsurvey stations. Survey results were normalized by applying seasonal factors to obtain annual \naverage daily traffic for the base year. Traffic counts were split into motorized (cars, pick-up \ntrucks, buses, trucks, light commercial vehicles, and motorcycles) and nonmotorized traffic \n(bicycles and animal-drawn vehicles). Traffic volume ranged from 2,594 to 4,693 vehicles per \nday, with about 84% motorized and 16% nonmotorized.  \n \n5.  Traffic Growth. Traffic growth rates were based on an analysis of various parameters. \nThe net state domestic product growth was examined and future growth estimated. The income \nelasticity of transport demand was used to determine traffic growth rate for each vehicle \ncategory. Traffic growth rates adopted varied from 3% to 12% per annum, depending on the \nvehicle type and the year. Based on the average vehicle composition for the project road, the \noverall growth rate is about 8.0% for 2004\u20132009, 8.5% for 2010\u20132014, and 8.0% for 2015 and \nbeyond.  \n   ", "  Appendix 16  47 \n2.  Costs and Benefits \n6.  Costs.  Economic  costs  were  derived  from  financial  costs  and  include  costs  for \nconstruction  and  for  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M).  Economic  costs  exclude  price \ncontingencies, taxes, duties, and interest during construction. A standard conversion factor of \n0.9 was applied to financial costs of non-traded inputs to calculate economic prices. A shadow \nwage rate factor of 0.85 was used to obtain the economic costs of unskilled labor. The project \nroads are expected to have an average economic life of 20 years. Incremental O&M costs were \ncalculated as the difference between maintenance requirements for the proposed four-lane \nhighway and existing two-lane  highway.  In  the  without- and with-project scenarios, routine \nmaintenance as well as periodical surface renewal will be required.  \n \n7.  Benefits. The upgraded highway will improve traffic flow, increase vehicle speeds, and \nshorten travel time, all resulting in lower VOCs. The main economic project benefits are (i) VOC \nsavings for normal traffic,17 and (ii) time savings for passengers and cargo transport. Pavement \ndeterioration and yearly VOCs over the life of the investment were predicted. In with- and \nwithout-project cases, the IRI varies from year to year according to traffic movement and the \nmaintenance applied, which directly impacts on VOC and level of benefits. Then life-cycle costs \nfor the with- and without-project situations were compared. The NPV and EIRR were computed, \ndiscounting the stream of costs and benefits over 2005\u20132027, and valuing them at present 2004 \nlevels.  \n \nTable A16.2: Summary of NPV and EIRR \nRoad Section  Description  Length  NPV  EIRR \n(km)  (Rs Million)  (%) \nSection 1  Lalitpur-Sagar   106.0   24.69  12.1 \nSection 2  Sagar-Rajmarg Chauraha  98.0   819.42  14.6 \nSection 3  Rajmarg Chauraha-Lakhnadon  109.7  1,888.64  17.8 \n    Total  2,732.75  14.9 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, km = kilometer, NPV = net present value, Rs = rupees. \nSource: Staff analysis. \n \n3.  Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n8.  The sensitivity of the total EIRR was analyzed with respect to changes in the benefit-\nand-cost streams, including (i) increase in construction costs by 20%, (ii) reduction in benefits \nby 20%, (iii) exclusion of the value of time-saving benefits, (iv) delay in project completion by 2 \nyears, and (v) a combination of an increase in capital costs of 20% and a reduction of benefits \nby 20%. A further sensitivity test examined the effect of diverted traffic on the project road. \nOrigin-destination surveys, and a traffic assignment model of a previous study, showed that 500 \ntrucks could be diverted from NH7 and NH8 to the project road once it was improved. \n \n9.  The EIRR for NH26 as a whole is 14.9%. The Project remains economically viable under \nvarious changes in the benefit-and-cost streams as the EIRR remains above the opportunity \ncost of capital of 12%, except when (i) benefits are reduced by 20%, and (ii) project capital costs \nare increased by 20% and benefits reduced by 20%. Risk analysis shows that these scenarios \nare improbable.  \n                                                 \n17  Normal traffic refers to projected traffic on the road under the with- and without-project scenarios.

A risk analysis was done using the @Risk computer software program, based on the \nuncertainty in the estimates of the input parameters. The analysis ran a simulation, in which \npossible values of the variables were randomly sampled 5,000 times using a Monte Carlo non-\nstratified  technique.  This  information  was  then  used  to  analyze  every  possible  outcome, \nexecuting hundreds of what-if scenarios.

Distribution Analysis and Poverty Impact Ratio \n11.  The economic benefits consist of road-user benefits, i.e., VOC savings for normal traffic, \nand time savings. The distribution analysis disaggregates these into benefits for passengers \nand freight users, vehicle owners and operators, labor,18 and the Government. The following \nwere estimated: (i) how much of the benefits for each vehicle category in the analysis will be \npassed on to the user of the vehicle, and (ii) ownership of each vehicle category. Field surveys \nwere done along the sample subproject road, and passengers, drivers, and farmers interviewed \nin each district. These surveys yielded a series of assumptions about what will be passed on to \nthe service user. The poverty impact ratio (PIR) was estimated by determining how much of the \nbenefits to each class of user are passed on to the poor.  \n \n12.  The estimated direct benefits to the economy in present value (PV) terms are presented \nusing a discount rate of 12%, representing the sum of the PV of benefits to passengers, freight \nusers, vehicle owners, and the Government. The PIR for the sample road is 1.12. The estimated \ndirect benefits of the sample road are Rs15,655 million, in PV terms, representing the sum of \nthe PV of benefits to passengers, freight users, vehicle owners, and the Government.

These are conservative estimates, \nbecause only direct project benefits have been considered. Based on the uncertain assumptions \nin the PIR calculation, a sensitivity analysis of some key assumptions has been done. The \nsensitivity tests were (i) a 50% increase in competition, and (ii) a 50% decrease in competition \nof passenger and freight services. It shows that increased competition increases the PIR.  \n \nTable A16.5: Sensitivity Analysis of Poverty Impact Ratio \nItem  Sample Subprojects \nBase Poverty Impact Ratio  1.12 \n50% Increase in Competition  1.22  \n50% Reduction in Competition  1.02 \nSource: Staff analysis. \n \n13.  A risk analysis was also done on the PIR. The results show that the expected PIR based \non the weighted average of all simulated combinations is 1.30. The PIRs range from 0.36 to \n2.46.  \n \nB.  Summary Financial Analysis \n \n14.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was calculated on the basis of incremental \nfinancial costs and benefits resulting from the Project over the construction period and 20 years \nof economic benefits. Financial costs and benefits are in 2004 constant prices. \n \n15.  Costs. Project costs comprise capital costs and (O&M). Capital costs include civil works; \nenvironmental improvement works; land acquisition, relocation of utilities, and resettlement \ncosts; construction supervision; and taxes and duties. Capital costs are to be incurred over 3 \nyears,  from  2005  to  2007.  O&M  costs  include  annual  routine maintenance and periodic \nmaintenance. The costs used for O&M are those used in the economic evaluation but in \nfinancial prices. Routine maintenance cost is about Rs100,000/km, and periodic maintenance \ncost (applied every 5 years) about Rs2 million/km.  \n \n16.  Benefits. Toll revenues are based on the traffic levels and growth rates and have been \nprojected at 2004 constant prices. Toll rates are based on those issued by the Ministry of Road \nTransport and Highways in 1997 and adjusted to 2004 prices. Toll rates per kilometer are (i) \nRs0.55 for cars or pick-up trucks, (ii) Rs0.96 for long vehicles, and (iii) Rs1.92 for buses or \ntrucks. A capture rate of traffic using the toll road is assumed at 75%. \n    \n1.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n17.  The FIRR is calculated at 3.3%, below the Project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC) in real terms at 4.6%.19 An FIRR lower than the WACC implies that the sample roads \nare not commercially viable, mainly because of the low level of traffic, and that private sector \nparticipation will be possible only when NHAI financially supports the investment with an up-\nfront lump sum, or with an annuity payment over the project period. This implies that national \nresources are transferred to the users in the form of VOC and time savings that are higher than \nthe price users pay. This resource transfer can be justified as long as the roads generate \nreasonable EIRRs and are chosen according to the national priority for the use of national \n                                                 \n19  The WACC was calculated based on the following assumptions: (i) 69% Government funding at 5% interest \n(approximately equal to a 10-year Treasury Bond rate), (ii) 13% Government loan at 13%, (iii) 18% NHAI bond \nissue at 5%, (iv) domestic inflation of 4%, and (v) NHAI\u2019s tax-exempt status to be continued. \n   ", "50  Appendix 16 \nresources. Toll revenues, however, will be able to cover recurring costs for road operation, \nincluding routine and periodic maintenance upon completion, which demonstrates that the core \nsection will be financially sustainable even with no further injection of national resources. \n \nTable A16.6: Summary of FIRR for the Sample Roads \nRoad Section  FIRR  \n(%) \nLalitpur - Sagar   1.5 \nSagar \u2013 Rajmarg Chauraha  2.7 \nRajmarg Chauraha \u2013 Lakhnadon  5.5 \nTotal  3.3 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return        \nSource: Staff analysis. \n \n2.  Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n18.  Several tests were undertaken to determine the sensitivity of the FIRR to changes in toll \nlevels, traffic capture ratio, traffic volume and traffic volume growth rate, O&M costs, and \ndelayed project completion. The FIRR is most sensitive to reductions in tariff level, traffic growth \nrate assumptions, and rate of traffic capture. An appropriate toll strategy as well as verified \ntraffic  growth  assumptions  will  be  critical  to  ensure  the  Projects  financial  viability  and \nsustainability. Diverting truck traffic from NH7 and NH8 to the project road would increase the \nFIRR from 3.3% to 5.0%. \n \nTable A16.7: FIRR Sensitivity Test of Sample Subprojects \nScenario  FIRR  \n(%) \nBase Case  3.3 \nSensitivity Tests   \nCapital Costs Increase by 20%  1.7 \nDecrease in Toll Levels by 20%  1.2 \nDecrease in Traffic Growth Rates by 20%  0.9 \nDecrease in Traffic Capture by 20%   1.2 \nDiverted Truck Traffic from NH7 and NH8  5.0 \nFIRR = financial internal rate of return. \nSource: Staff analysis. \n \n19.  Due to the uncertainties in several key parameters, a risk analysis was also done using \n@Risk. The results showed that the chance that the FIRR could fall below the WACC of 4.6% is \n99.6%, i.e., virtually 100%. The new mean FIRR is 3.0%, with minimum value of 1.0%  and \nmaximum value of 5.1%.  \n \nTable A16.8: Results of FIRR Risk Analysis \nScenario  Total  \n(%) \nBase FIRR  3.0 \nProbability of FIRR Less than 4.6% (WACC)  99.6 \nMinimum FIRR Estimate  1.0 \nMaximum FIRR Estimate  5.1 \nMedian FIRR Estimate  3.0 \n    FIRR = financial internal rate of return. \n    Source: Staff analysis.\n   ", "  Appendix 17  51\nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: \n \nInadequate road infrastructure, including lack of connectivity between states, has long impeded development, \nparticularly  transport  of  goods  between  states.  Infrastructure  development  encourages  other  development \ninitiatives, which together considerably stimulate economic growth leading to poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nThe Project will upgrade 566 kilometers (km) of the key highway network, particularly the north-south corridor \nunder sector loan modality. Poverty analysis was carried out along the sample roads of about 313 km, from \nLalitpur to Lakhnadon, covering 2 districts in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 3 districts in Madhya Pradesh (MP). \n \nThe poverty level in the Project area is between 31% and 37%, significantly higher than India\u2019s average of 27%. \nThe estimated annual per capita income of those living below poverty level is Rs3,889 (less than $90) in each \nstate. The poverty incidence in the project districts ranges from 22.8% in Narsimhapur to 51.78% in Sagar. The \nproject area is predominantly rural and passes through a total of 93 villages and small towns and 5 urban areas \nin the two states. The rural poor have limited access to socioeconomic services.  \n \nThe Project aims to connect northern and southern India. Although not a poverty intervention, the Project will, by \nvirtue of passing through rural areas where a large percentage of the population below poverty line lives, help \nreduce  poverty  by  encouraging  human  development  and  economic  growth.  Increased  connectivity  with \nmainstream economic regions will also help reduce regional disparities between fast-growing and backward \nstates. The economic analysis estimated the Project\u2019s net economic benefits as Rs.2,787 million, and the \npoverty impact ratio as more than 1, meaning that the poor will receive most of the gross economic benefits but \ncontribute only a small share of the gross investment costs. This indicates that the Project is highly pro-poor. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes    No \n \nConsultations and meetings with the various project communities were organized during the social analysis to \nascertain  their  response  to  road  construction, the communities\u2019 needs and demands, an estimate of the \ncommunities\u2019 losses, and steps to mitigate them. Twenty-two focus group discussions were also held with men, \nwomen, farmers, indigenous people, scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, and other disadvantaged groups. \nPublic participation through household surveys and focus group meetings in the project area highlighted what \npeople thought would be major project benefits: \n \n(i)  Better roads mean more reliable and cheaper transportation to markets.  \n(ii)  Rural laborers will increase their income during project road construction by working at unskilled \njobs, and will thus be able to purchase consumer goods.  \n(iii)  Better access to educational facilities will reduce illiteracy. The project area in MP has a literacy \nrate of 76% for males and 50% for females, and in UP, 70% and 43%. \n(iv)  Increased mobility enables people to look for jobs, even when agricultural work is slow. \n(v)  Increased access to other services will reduce poverty and improve the quality of life. Improved \nroads will give the poor access to services, decrease travel time, and ensure that medical \nfacilities can be reached efficiently.  \n   ", "52  Appendix 17 \n(vi)  A large part of the traffic on the road is freight, mostly carrying agricultural produce. Reductions \nin freight vehicle operators\u2019 costs may be passed on to farmers or shippers as lower freight \nrates. A fall in the cost of moving freight will also reduce product costs. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nBased on the premise that no development activity can be gender neutral, gender participation was ensured \nduring the social study by a gender analysis to see how the Project would impact on women. The Project will \nbenefit men and women, and offer women special benefits by increasing girls\u2019 access middle- and higher-level \neducation, and women\u2019s and children\u2019s access to improved local services and high levels of health care outside \nthe village. Focus group discussions with the women of various castes and communities revealed that they all \nfavored construction of a road. However, they raised some concerns about the risk of human trafficking due to \nincreased vehicular movement, and of their children, especially girls, becoming easy targets. A separate anti-\ntrafficking program will be required in the project area. \nHas an output been prepared?   Yes   No  \n \nE.

The sample subproject road begins at the end of Lalitpur bypass (kilometer [km] 94) and \nends at   km 198 of national highway (NH) 26. The project road is 104 km long, passing through \nLalitpur in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Sagar in Madhya Pradesh (MP). \n2.  The average right of way on NH26 is 35 meters (m) in the UP section (40 km) and 25 m \nin the MP section (64 km). Thus, more land has to be acquired to widen the road to a four- to \nsix-lane dual carriageway. Five village bypasses and one major bypass for Sagar will require \nthe acquisition of a 60 m-wide strip of land. Other facilities such as underpasses, flyovers, \nservice roads, access roads, bus bays, truck parking, and toll plazas are proposed. \nA.  PROJECT IMPACTS  \n3.  Land Acquisition. Efforts have been made to minimize displacement and disruption of \nlivelihoods.  Alternative  widening  options  were  considered  and  socially  viable  alignments \nfinalized for the settlement and sensitive areas, based on social impact assessments and public \nconsultations. However, an estimated 390 hectares (ha) have to be acquired to (i) widen the \nexisting right of way (about 265 ha); (ii) improve intersections and construct bypasses to avoid \ncongestion in urban stretches and reduce accidents at major intersections (about 134 ha); and \n(iii) provide rest areas, toll plazas, truck terminals, bus bays, and utility centers (about 1 ha). \nDetails of these requirements will be determined after the designs have been finalized. \n \n4.  Type of Losses.  The census and socioeconomic survey of the project-affected area \nenumerated 2,077 project-affected households (11,391 affected people), of which 1,440 are \nagricultural landholders. Based on the census and socioeconomic surveys, a social profile has \nbeen outlined for the project area. The census survey is limited to non-titleholders. Titleholder \nstructures and the census results of landholders will be incorporated into the final report. Most \nstructures are owner occupied. Only 41 squatters are enumerated in the corridor of impact \nbecause the project road avoids many settled areas. \nTable A18.1: Social Profile \nProperty  District  Owner  Tenant  Squatter  Total \nResidential  Lalitpur  260  0  2  262 \n  Sagar  170  0  2  172 \nTotal Residential    430  0  4  434 \nCommercial  Lalitpur  78  1  21  100 \n  Sagar  86  4  20  110 \nTotal Commercial    164  5  41  210 \n \nTable A18.2: Type of Loss \nType of Loss  Lalitpur  Sagar  Total  Percentage \nResidential structure  260  172  432  63.62 \nCommercial structure  68  88  156  22.97 \nResidential cum commercial structure  17  8  25  3.68 \nCommunity structure  1  0  1  0.15 \nReligious structure  5  5  10  1.47 \nGovernment structure  18  13  31  4.57 \nOther private structurea  14  10  24  3.54 \nTotal  383  296  679  100.00 \na Includes boundary walls, foundations, abandoned structures, cattle sheds etc. \n   ", "54  Appendix 18 \n6.  Impacts  on  Indigenous  and  Vulnerable  Groups.  Affected  people  belonging  to \nvulnerable  categories\u2014below  the  poverty  line,  scheduled  castes,  scheduled  tribes,  other \nbackward castes, and women-headed households are considered socially vulnerable and thus \nneed special consideration so that they can benefit from the Project. The titleholders and non-\ntitleholders  include  303  people  below  poverty  line,  38  members  of  scheduled  castes,  8 \nmembers of scheduled tribes, and 1 household headed by a physically handicapped person. \nTable A18.3: Socially Vulnerable Groups \nVulnerable Group (household) \nDistrict \nBPLa  SC  ST  OBC  WHH  PHH \nLalitpur  169  22  4  123  0  1 \nSagar  134  16  4  55  0  0 \nTotal  303  38  8  178  0  1 \nBPL = below poverty line, OBC = other backward cast, PHH = physically handicapped headed household, SC = \nscheduled cast, ST = scheduled tribe, WHH = women-headed household. \na This includes some households from other categories, which are not presented in respective categories. \n \n7.  The scheduled tribe households affected by the Project are engaged in small business \nor work as laborers. They migrated from Rajasthan several generations ago and make their \nliving like the general affected population. The surveys and other data sources show that the \nscheduled tribe population directly impacted by the Project is similar to the overall population \nand assimilated into the local communities. The scheduled tribes share their sources of water, \nfolklore, food, infrastructure, and other belongings with the rest of the community. These groups \nare also open to new ideas such as family planning and formal education. Most of these tribes \nhave a nuclear family norm. While scheduled tribes meet the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ndefinition of indigenous\u2014descended from a specific population group\u2014they do not maintain \ndistinct social or cultural identities, and freely interact with the mainstream population. \n8.  Gender Issues. Women\u2019s participation in economic activities is almost negligible. Most \nproject-affected women do not have any financial decision-making power in their households, \nbut their opinion is sought for children\u2019s health care or day-to-day activities or social functions. \nThe project resettlement policy provides for women to be involved in sustainable development. \nParticipation  of  women  in  the  Project  is  envisaged  in  (i)  planning;  (ii)  ensuring  that \ncompensation for land and assets is the same for all affected families; (iii) consulting and \nparticipating in group activities to gain access and control over resources as a part of the \nresettlement  plan;  and  (d)  issuing  identity  cards,  opening  bank  accounts,  and  receiving \ncompensation payments. The entitlement framework considers women-headed households as \nvulnerable and compensates and helps them.  \nB.  Resettlement Principles and Compensation  \n \n9.  The resettlement plan is based on the resettlement and rehabilitation framework adopted \nby the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for ADB-funded projects, complying with \nADB guidelines. The plan aims to adequately compensate all types of losses and impacts \nresulting from the Project, and to restore and improve the economic condition of the affected \npopulation. The entitlement policy recognizes all types of affected people, including squatters, \nvulnerable encroachers, titleholders, and kiosk owners. All squatters, vulnerable encroachers, \nand kiosk owners present before the cut-off date will be entitled to assistance. Barring kiosk \nowners, others will be paid the replacement cost for structures, and shifting and transition \nallowances. Kiosk owners will receive a lump sum as a shifting allowance. Training will be given \n   ", "  Appendix 18  55\nto people losing commercial activities. Titleholders losing structures will be paid to replace them, \nincluding the cost of homestead land and trees, and shifting and transition allowances. Affected \npeoples losing land will be paid to replace land lost, and a transitional allowance. Tenants will \nreceive  shifting  allowances,  rental  allowance,  deposits,  and  compensation  for  erected \nstructures, if any. Material can be salvaged at no cost. All incidental costs\u2014registration cost, \nstamp  duty,  etc.\u2014will  be  borne  by  the  Project.  It  will  rebuild  community  utilities  and \ninfrastructure that are to be dismantled. The policy also asserts an integrated income restoration \nstrategy for affected peoples losing their source of income. Vulnerable persons will get a one-\ntime economic rehabilitation grant to establish their businesses and livelihood.  All common \nproperty resources will be replaced before demolition of the old ones. Specific entitlements for \nthe  different  categories  of  losses  are  contained  in  the  entitlement  matrix  (Supplementary \nAppendix J). \nC.  Stakeholder Participation, Disclosure of the Resettlement Plan, and Grievances  \n \n10.  Public consultations were held with various sections of affected people such as traders, \nwomen,  village  elders,  panchayat  members,  government  officials,  and  local  voluntary \norganizations.21 These consultations will continue during project implementation. People in the \ncommunity generally agreed that the highway should be widened, and highly appreciated the \nconsultation.  Issues  related  to  safety,  compensation,  income  restoration,  job  creation, \nHIV/AIDS, trafficking of women, information flow, grievance redress, role of administration, etc. \nwere discussed. Transparency in project implementation was also raised. The resettlement plan \naddresses  all  issues  raised  during  public  consultation  and  recommends  institutional-\nstrengthening measures. The RP has been disclosed at panchayats, block offices, district \nmagistrates\u2019 offices, and project implementation units (PIUs), in English and Hindi. \n11.  All efforts will be made to settle affected people\u2019s grievances as amicably as possible. \nOut-of-court settlement is preferred since this expedites dispute settlement and helps timely \nproject implementation. Grievance redress committees (GRCs) will be set up at the district level, \ncomprising  representatives  of  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs);  public  agencies \nrepresentatives; women\u2019s groups, squatters, and vulnerable affected peoples; line departments \nand  affected  people,  especially  women;  and  a  representative  of  the  respective  district \nadministrations. At least two people from each group will be in the GRC. Women will make up at \nleast  a  third  of  GRC  members. Investigations will be thorough enough to satisfy affected \npeoples. The GRC will meet quarterly or more frequently as required and respond a grievance \nin 15 days. It will continue to function during the entire life of the Project, including the defects \nliability periods, to (i) help affected peoples solve problems arising out of land and property \nacquisition; (ii) record the grievances, and categorize, prioritize, and solve them within a month; \n(iii) inform PIUs of serious cases within an appropriate time frame; and (iv) report to the \naggrieved parties about progress on their grievances and the PIUs\u2019 decisions. \nD.  Relocation Site Development and Rehabilitation Assistance \n \n12.  Requirements for relocating affected people will be known only after the census surveys \nare  completed.  The  final  RP  will  include  more  details  on  this.  Displaced  titleholders  and \nsquatters losing residential and commercial properties may opt for resettlement sites, preferably \nclose to where they lived before the Project. The RP provides residential plots of all squatters, \nwho may choose self-relocation with compensation and related assistance. PIUs and NGOs will \ndetermine if each household can find replacement land for a dwelling, and, if the household \n                                                 \n21 A panchayat means a local government body, lower than a village. \n   ", "56  Appendix 18 \ncannot, NHAI will provide the land. Relocation sites will be selected in consultation with affected \nfamilies and panchayat members. All identified land will be free of encroachment and other \nencumbrances.  NGOs  will  explore  the  possibility  of  land  for  resettlement  sites.  As  most \ndisplaced affected peoples have opted for cash compensation and self-relocation,  they will \nreceive support from the Project during relocation and also receive compensation for structures, \nand shifting and income assistance. Wherever resettlement sites are developed, additional \nsupport will be provided, including civic amenities such as wells, tube wells for drinking water, \nsanitary facilities, and community halls to facilitate resettler-host relationships. If a group has \nalready identified a potential site, NGOs will visit it along with community representatives to see \nif it is adequate and suitable, and collect information on its title and availability from the local \nrevenue department.  \nE.  Implementation Framework and Budget \n \n13.  NHAI\u2019s environment and social development unit (ESDU) will coordinate and supervise \nresettlement. Resettlement and rehabilitation cells will be established under PIUs. Each PIU, \nheaded  by  a  project  director  or  a  project  manager,  will  be  supported  by  a  manager  for \nresettlement and environmental issues. Experienced NGOs (one per package) will be engaged \nto  implement  resettlement  activities  and  coordinate  with  other  relevant  departments  and \nstakeholders in the Project. The NGOs will also organize and conduct training programs, \nconduct  awareness  campaigns,  verify  affected  peoples  and  their  assets,  and  help  settle \ndisputes. At the district level GRCs will help the PIU resolve disputes and implement the \nresettlement plan. Additional staff for resettlement will be provided as necessary to improve the \nESDU\u2019s capacity.  \n15.  Resettlement  will  take  40  months,  including  planning,  surveying,  assessing,  policy \ndevelopment, institution identification, affected people\u2019s participation, income restoration, and \nother resettlement activities. For each section, compensation for acquired assets will be paid \nbefore construction begins, and resettlement sites built before people are relocated. \n16.  The  resettlement  budget  of  Rs.360  million  covers  (i)  compensation  (62.7%),  (ii) \nsupplementary assistance (21.0%), (iii) replacement of common property resources (6.0%), (iv) \nresettlement implementation support (6.8%), and (v) contingencies (3.5%).  \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n17.  Internal and external monitoring will be in place as specified in the resettlement plan. \nThe PIU will carry out internal monitoring, while an external monitoring agency (EMA) will \nconduct third-party monitoring and midterm and end-term evaluation. The EMA will submit \nperiodic progress reports to NHAI, which will then submit them to ADB in the first year of \nmonitoring, after which the EMA will submit quarterly reports. The EMA will carry out a midterm \nevaluation  based  on  a  25%  sample  of  affected  peoples,  covering  titleholders  and  non-\ntitleholders, at the end of eighteenth month of the contract. At the end of the third year, end-line \nevaluation will be carried out. Monitoring and evaluation formats are given in the resettlement \nplan. \nG.  Entitlement Matrix \n18.  The  entitlement  matrix  describes  the  principles  and  approach  to  be  followed  in \ncompensating affected people. The matrix (Supplementary Appendix J) has been  developed \nbased on NHAI and ADB guidelines on involuntary resettlement. \n   "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20041227120236+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041203140328+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R282-04.doc", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 6.0 for Word", "Author": "aj3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "SourceModified": "D:20041203060312"}}
