INTRODUCTION\n1. In 1999, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) announced its vision of an Asian and\nPacific Region that is free of poverty. This vision required a reordering of priorities: from poverty\nreduction being just one of the five strategic objectives, to now being ADB\u2019s overarching goal. In\nNovember the Board approved a poverty reduction strategy.1 The strategy commits ADB to\nimplementing an accelerated program to strengthen its statistical database on poverty beginning\nin 2000. This regional technical assistance (TA) is a major step toward building this database.2\nThe TA framework is given in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. ADB's  demand-driven  statistical  data  collection  has  traditionally  cut  across  all  five\nstrategic objectives:  promote economic growth, reduce poverty, support human development,\nimprove the status of women, and protect the environment.  Likewise,  significant  statistical\ncapacity-building  assistance  to  the  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  has  focused  on\nimproving  economic  and  social  databases,  which  encompass  statistics  on  the  economic,\nfinancial,  and  social  sectors.  However,  the  new  primary  focus  on  poverty  reduction  will\nnecessitate expanded data collection and increased depth of coverage to effectively monitor\npoverty as reflected in ADB's statistical data collection and capacity-building programs.\n3. ADB's poverty reduction strategy paper spells out the steps to be taken to support\ndevelopment of a specific poverty reduction strategy for each borrowing country. These start\nwith a thorough analysis of poverty in the country, the findings of which will be discussed in a\nhigh-level forum led by the government and other stakeholders.  The priorities identified by the\npoverty analysis and forum will be the basis of ADB\u2019s operational strategy for the country.  In\nturn, a partnership agreement reflecting the focus of the operational strategy will be forged\nbetween the country and ADB.  The agreement3 will set out agreed targets for poverty reduction\nand milestones needed to monitor the rate at which the targets are being reached. Many of\nthese milestones and targets are quantitative social and economic indicators; hence, it may be\nsaid that the poverty monitoring is evidence based. Finally, a country assistance plan translates\nthe partnership agreement into a specific program of assistance for reducing poverty in the\ncountry.  Feedback from the poverty monitoring should be valuable inputs to the annual fine-\ntuning of the three-year rolling country assistance plan.\n4. The poverty analysis in each borrowing country will require a benchmark database that\nwill facilitate a comprehensive understanding of poverty and its determinants. Aside from core\npoverty statistics, such as magnitude and depth of poverty, the database should also include\nkey demographic and economic statistics, as well as indicators of social and living conditions\nsuch as health and mortality, education, gender (in)equality, housing and basic household\namenities, employment, environment, and governance. A representative list of these statistics is\nshown in Appendix 2. To the extent possible, and depending on the individual country and ADB\nneeds  as  spelled  out  in  the  partnership  agreement,  the  data  should  be  disaggregated\n                                               \n1  R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank,\n9 November.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (electronic version) in January 2000.\n3  Partnership agreements for Bangladesh and Mongolia have already been completed while work to forge such\nagreements is still ongoing in several countries.", "2\ngeographically (e.g., states, province, urban-rural), by gender, and  by  vulnerable  or  target\ngroups.\n5. Effective poverty monitoring requires credible, solid statistics.  It is, therefore, important\nto  thoroughly document the  metadata  --  concepts,  definitions, and  methods on  which  the\nassessment of data quality and reliability will be based.  A regional perspective is also vital in\npoverty monitoring to gauge the progress of a country compared with that of its neighbors and\nto periodically assess the effectiveness of poverty reduction programs in the region.  The\nmetadata and a consistent database system are necessary to facilitate comparison across\ncountries and estimation of region-wide poverty indicators.4\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n6. The TA aims to support ADB\u2019s commitment to an accelerated program to strengthen its\nstatistical database on poverty.  The specific objective is to build a poverty database system in\nADB based, initially, on available data collected from ADB\u2019s poverty assessment activities, and\nfrom the borrowing countries and other international agencies. To meet this objective, existing\npoverty data from all sources will be collected, reviewed, and processed to determine relevant\npoverty-related indicators to support the new ADB Poverty Reduction Strategy. The database\nwill be organized systematically as a computerized system that can be easily accessed by ADB\nstaff and external users through the Internet.\n7. The TA has two secondary but important benefits. The actual condition of the database\nin each country will serve as a valuable input in preparing long-term plans for national statistical\ncapacity building. The documentation of definitions and methods used by the  countries  to\nassess poverty, e.g., the estimation of poverty lines, will provide useful directions for ADB\u2019s\nfuture work on proposing common concepts and methods that will be acceptable to the DMCs\nand that would advance regional comparability of poverty statistics.\nB.  Scope\n8. The TA will cover 15 Asian DMCs, chosen on the basis of magnitude and depth of\npoverty in the population, the relative size of ADB\u2019s assistance program, and the availability of\npoverty statistics or supporting primary data.5 Eight of these countries, namely Bangladesh,\nPeople's Republic of China, India, Indonesia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, and Sri Lanka are\nhome to most of Asia\u2019s poor, while in Cambodia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's\nDemocratic Republic, Mongolia, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam the transition to a market economy\nand the concomitant reforms have generally increased poverty incidence.\n                                               \n4  This TA will not develop region-wide poverty indicators.   Some of the major requirements for this purpose,\nhowever, will become available at the successful completion of this TA. Thus, the development of region-wide\npoverty indicators would be facilitated.\n5  Compilation of the poverty databases in some of these DMCs, such as the People's Republic of China, India,\nIndonesia, and Philippines, was initiated in 1999. Some DMCs, e.g. Bhutan and many in the Pacific, are not\ncovered by the TA because they are known not to have undertaken any poverty assessment; hence, country-\nspecific assistance to produce poverty measures should be the appropriate first step. Some of the Pacific DMCs\nwill be covered by another TA that will be administered by the Office of Pacific Operations also in 2000.", "3\n9. A review of the current status of poverty measurement and data availability in each\ncountry will be undertaken. An inventory of existing poverty reports and  studies,  including\ndetailed descriptions of survey data sets, as well as definitions, measurements, methods used,\nand statements about data quality, will be carried out. The inventory will include identification of\nall poverty-related official surveys undertaken recently in the country and the different sources of\nadministrative records covering key demographics, housing, health, income, wealth and related\neconomic variables, education, employment, environment, and governance.\n10. Relevant poverty statistics as well as poverty-related demographic, social, and economic\nstatistics that are not yet in the Statistical Database System (SDBS) 6or in the country databases\nmaintained by Programs Department (East) (PED) and Programs Department (West) (PWD),\nwill be collected. Data will be compiled down to the relevant subnational levels, if available. In\ncases when poverty statistics are not available, existing survey data will be utilized to derive\nthem.  Metadata on poverty and poverty-related statistics will also be collected.  On the basis of\nthe metadata, the reliability and accessibility of the corresponding statistics or indicator will be\nevaluated and disseminated.\n11. A computerized poverty database system (POVDBS) will be developed in ADB to store\npoverty  and  poverty-related  statistics;  concepts  and  definitions  of  poverty,  procedures  for\nderiving  poverty  indexes,  reliability  and  accessibility  of  each  indicator  and  other  related\nindicators; and other data attributes.  Links to the established country database systems of PED\nand PWD will be incorporated in POVDBS to allow data exchange and comparison between\nsystems.  The POVDBS will also include a user-friendly on-line query module that will enable all\nADB staff, including those in the resident missions (RMs), to retrieve data, as well as an\nautomatic report-generation application for preparing reports that may be required for poverty\nmonitoring. In addition to statistical tables, the on-line query module will also present data\noverlaid in digitized maps using a geographical information system application. A website that\nhas a direct link to the POVDBS will be established to serve external users. A reporting system\nmodule will be developed to facilitate data entry to the POVDBS by the RMs and other ADB\nunits.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $600,000 equivalent. The entire amount will\nbe financed on  a grant basis from  the  ADB-funded  TA  Program.  The  cost estimates  are\npresented in Appendix 3.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Statistics and Data Systems Division\n(EDSD) of the Economics and Development Resource Center, in close consultation with the\nPoverty Reduction Unit, PED, PWD, Office of Information Systems and Technology (OIST), and\nOffice of External Relations will be responsible for implementing the TA. A working committee\nchaired by EDSD with the Poverty Reduction Unit, PED, and PWD as members will be formed\nto establish a system for data collection, and define the contents and format of reports to be\ngenerated from the POVDBS. The system will include the list of indicators and attributes that will\n                                               \n6  The contents of the SDBS are predominantly macro and national level data, with some texts like footnotes and\nsources. On the other hand, the poverty database system will have sectoral and subnational-level data, as well as\nsignificantly more text material such as definitions, methodologies, and a substantive part of the poverty report.\nThese differences justify the separate, but linked, systems.", "4\nbe collected, the process of data collection and update, and the responsibilities of each party\ninvolved. The working committee will also review the poverty data and reports collected before\nthey are entered in the POVDBS. This review process should improve database coverage and\nrelevance  to  needs,  promote  the  use  of  common  data  and  sources,  and  discourage  the\nproliferation of overlapping databases in ADB.7\n14. The TA will be implemented over 12 months, beginning in May 2000. The TA will require\nrecruitment of an international consultant for nine person-months, a domestic consultant for\neach participating DMC (except those where data collection has already been completed) for\nthree  person-months  each,  a  database  designer  for  two  person-months,  two  application\nprogrammers for three person-months each, and two technical and administrative support staff\nfor six person-months. All the consultants and support staff will be recruited individually in\naccordance  with  ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The terms of reference for the\nconsultants and support staff are in Appendix 4.\n15. The international consultant will assist EDSD and the working committee in resolving\ntechnical  problems  with  the  DMCs\u2019  poverty  data,  in  reviewing  and  revising  the  domestic\nconsultants\u2019 reports, and in preparing some of the DMCs poverty databases and reports. The\ndomestic consultant will compile poverty and poverty-related statistics that are not in the SDBS,\nand will do the inventory of poverty reports and existing studies for the assigned DMC. For the\nmajor borrowing DMCs, the domestic consultants will present their reports in seminars, either at\nADB headquarters or at the RMs. The database designer and the two application programmers\nwill work on the design and development of applications of the POVDBS. They will coordinate\nand work closely with EDSD, the working committee, OIST, and the international consultant in\ndesigning the database structure and in developing  application modules that are robust enough\nto accommodate varying characteristics of poverty data as reported by the different DMCs. The\nwebsite design and implementation will be coordinated with the Office of External Relations.\nThe two technical and administrative support staff will work at ADB headquarters to assist in\nbuilding the POVDBS.\n16. The  POVDBS  prototype,  including  the  reporting  system,  will  be  developed  in  four\nmonths from TA inception. It will be evaluated based on a number of criteria, such as design,\nspeed, and user friendliness. On the basis of the results of the evaluation, the prototype will be\nenhanced to a production version that will be accessible to all ADB staff and external users. In\nline with the new key role of the RMs in monitoring the poverty indicators and milestones set out\nin the partnership agreements between the borrowing countries and ADB, EDSD staff will\nfamiliarize and train RM staff on the use of the POVDBS reporting system. This system should\nensure timely and continuous updating of the POVDBS.8\n17. The purchase of necessary materials and equipment from the TA funds, such as a\nserver, notebook computers, color printer, scanner, digitizer, liquid crystal display  projector,\nsurvey data  sets,  and  geographic  information  system  application  software  will  be done  in\n                                               \n 7 The Office of Pacific Operations will be invited to the working committee as soon as the POVDBS coverage is\nextended to the Pacific DMCs.\n 8  In a related but separate activity, EDSD and the Bangladesh Resident Mission have reached an agreement to\ndevelop a pilot microcomputer-based database-and-reporting system that would facilitate monthly or quarterly\nelectronic transmission of reports and statistics to headquarters. Replicating the system to the other RMs is part of\nthe plan.", "5\naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. The procurement and disposition of all\ncomputing equipment will be coordinated with OIST and the Office of Administrative Services.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$600,000 for the purpose of Building a Poverty Database, and hereby reports such action to the\nBoard.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nSummary Indicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\n1.
