INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN  Growth  Area \n(BIMP-EAGA)1 recognizes the importance of trade facilitation in achieving its goals to increase \ntrade and tourism and strengthen the economic integration of the growth area. BIMP-EAGA \ncountries have committed to aligning their trade-facilitation programs with similar programs \nunder the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and to serving as a testing ground \nfor  fast-tracked  implementation.  BIMP-EAGA  leaders\u2019  endorsement  of  priority  transport \nconnectivity projects at their sixth summit in Cha-am, Thailand, in October 2009 underpinned \nthe need for related policy and regulatory measures on trade facilitation. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported BIMP-EAGA since its establishment \nin 1994.2 It was appointed by BIMP-EAGA leaders as a regional development advisor in 2001. \nIn 2007, ADB approved a regional technical assistance3 to strengthen the role of the BIMP-\nEAGA Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, and Security Task Force (CIQS TF)4 as a platform for \ndeveloping and implementing trade security and facilitation programs. The TA assisted the \nCIQS TF in formulating the Memorandum of Understanding for the Simplification, Streamlining, \nand Harmonization of Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, and Security Procedures (MOU), and \nin  preparing  standard  operating  procedures  (SOPs)  to  implement  the  MOU.  The  MOU  is \nexpected to be signed in 2010. BIMP-EAGA countries requested at various forums held in 2009 \nADB  follow-on  TA  to  implement  the  MOU  and  the  SOPs  and  concurred  with  the  impact, \noutcomes, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference  for  the  proposed  regional  policy  and  advisory  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  A review of the customs, immigration, quarantine, and security (CIQS) environment in \nBIMP-EAGA, conducted under the TA for Support for Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, and \nSecurity  Harmonization  in  Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East  ASEAN \nGrowth Area, highlighted differences in CIQS capacity at priority entry points6 arising from \nmember  countries\u2019  varying  modes  of  and  progress  toward  compliance  with  international \nstandards and conventions, as well as the wide disparity between developments achieved at the \nnational  level  and  current  practices  at  the  priority  entry  points.  Performance  gaps  revolve \naround nonphysical barriers to the efficient movement of goods and people in the form of \n                                                 \n1  BIMP-EAGA is a subregional cooperation framework initiated in 1994. The growth area comprises the entire \nsultanate of Brunei Darussalam; Kalimantan, Sulawesi, the Maluku Island chain, and Irian Jaya in Indonesia; the \nfederal states of Sabah and Sarawak, and the federal territory of Labuan in Eastern Malaysia; and the islands of \nMindanao and Palawan in the Philippines. By making any designation of or reference to a particular territory or \ngeographic area in this document, ADB does not intend to make any judgments as to the legal or other status of \nany territory or area. \n2  Since 1994, ADB has provided $13.22 million in technical assistance in support of BIMP-EAGA. \n3  ADB.  2007.  Technical  Assistance  for  the  Support  for  Customs,  Immigration,  Quarantine,  and  Security \nHarmonization in the Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area. Manila TA \n6408-REG for $600,000, approved on 20 August 2007. \n4  The CIQS TF is composed of senior officials from the national CIQS agencies of member countries. It serves as \nthe institutional mechanism for coordination and information exchange on CIQS initiatives in BIMP-EAGA.  \n5  The  TA  first  appeared  in  the  business  opportunities  section  of  ADB\u2019s  website  on  04  January  2010 \n(http://www.adb.org/projects/project.asp?id=41348). \n6  There are eight priority entry points: Muara port in Brunei Darussalam, Bitung port and Entikong border crossing in \nIndonesia, Labuan and Sandakan ports and Tebedu border crossing in Malaysia, and General Santos and \nZamboanga ports in the Philippines. The CIQS TF designated them as pilot areas for CIQS initiatives to support \ncross-border trade and the movement of people.  \n ", "2   \ncomplex  procedures  and  numerous  documentation  requirements.  Clearing  procedures  and \nformalities are labor intensive and time consuming, as transactions are mostly paper based.  \n \n5.  Need to streamline and standardize CIQS processes. The CIQS mapping exercise in \nBIMP-EAGA showed that as many as 15 documents are required for the clearance of incoming \nvessels  at  seaports,  which  must  be  submitted  to  at  least  seven  agencies.  Most  of  these \ndocuments are submitted to two or more agencies, thereby requiring at least 30 submissions \nper entry. Moreover, about eight documents are separately submitted to customs and other \nregulatory agencies for processing import clearance. This voluminous documentation illustrates \nthe need for simplification and streamlining with a view to reducing the number of documentary \nrequirements, enhancing data and information sharing among agencies, and exploring practical \noptions to enable single submission and synchronized processing. The quantitative impacts of \nthese constraints, though significant, are difficult to measure as trade transactions across BIMP-\nEAGA are carried out by small and informal traders. Average clearance times exceed 1 day at \nmost ports, while land border clearance takes more than 3 hours. Given the low volume of trade \ntransactions in these entry points, average clearance times are considered high. The standard \ndeviations are also high, suggesting unpredictability in the clearance process that makes it \ndifficult for traders to plan business and ensure the timely delivery of goods. In addition, the \nmovement of people across BIMP-EAGA needs facilitation to support both trade and tourism. \nAlthough  EAGA  nationals  enjoy  visa-exempt  entry  for  a  limited  stay  following  an  ASEAN \narrangement, CIQS facilitation measures are needed for such frequent travelers as cross-border \ncommuting workers, crews of border-crossing vessels such as fishers, operators of cross-border \nvehicles, and visiting third-country nationals. Foreign visitors face difficulty traveling across \nBIMP  countries  by  sea  or  land  because  of  inadequate  visa-on-arrival  facilities  at  major \ncheckpoints, as well as lengthy, complicated procedures for bringing their personal effects \nthrough customs and quarantine. \n \n6.  Lack  of  capacity  to  implement  international  standards  and  best  practices. \nDiagnostic studies carried out under the TA for Support for Customs, Immigration, Quarantine, \nand  Security  Harmonization  in  Brunei  Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines  East \nASEAN Growth Area showed that efforts to standardize CIQS systems at local entry points \nshould  be  accompanied  by  corresponding  enhancement  of  local  CIQS  officials\u2019  skills  and \nbehavior. At most BIMP-EAGA entry points, improvements initiated by member countries are \ninefficiently enforced for lack of local officials\u2019 understanding of updated international standards \nand skills required to implement trade-facilitation reforms. The lack of efficient communication \namong local CIQS agencies and across entry points hinders the exchange of information. This \nis an important element of border control, risk assessment, and trade facilitation reforms called \nfor in the MOU.  \n \n7.  Need  to  establish  and/or  strengthen  coordination  mechanisms  for  trade \nfacilitation.  Institutional  mechanisms  need  to  be  strengthened  to  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of initiatives to facilitate trade. The MOU provides for strengthening the CIQS TF \nand establishing national and local CIQS-coordinating bodies to ensure the regular exchange of \ninformation  and  provide  appropriate  support  mechanisms.  The  CIQS  TF  should,  with  the \nsupport of its secretariat, continue to provide strategic direction subregionally, while in-country \ninstitutional structures facilitate vertical and horizontal coordination and collaboration. The local \nCIQS coordinating bodies should provide the venue at the port level for local agencies, in \nconsultation with the private sector and local government representatives, to address issues \nthat require integrated responses from multiple agencies. These include synchronizing working \nhours, rationalizing controls, conducting joint inspections, and other activities that involve mutual \nassistance and cooperation among border agencies.  Strengthening the capacity of local CIQS-\n ", "  3\ncoordinating bodies is clearly an operational imperative to ensure the effective implementation \nof the MOU. \n \n8.  Opportunity  to  strengthen  public\u2013private  partnership  for  trade  facilitation. The \nBIMP-EAGA CIQS TF and the BIMP-EAGA heads of customs welcome the participation of the \nprivate sector, through the BIMP-EAGA Business Council (BEBC), at their annual meetings. \nThe  BEBC  regularly  addresses  trade  facilitation  issues  arising  in  consultations  with  local \nbusiness  communities  in  BIMP-EAGA.  This  form  of  public\u2013private  partnership  should  be \ncontinued and further expanded to include local consultative platforms at which the private \nsector can recommend measures to address their concerns in cross-border trade. \n \n9.  Need to address poor private sector compliance. At the recent dialogue conducted \nduring the third meeting of the BIMP-EAGA heads of customs in September 2009, the BEBC \nacknowledged that the private sector\u2019s lack of awareness on CIQS rules, regulations, and \nprocedures (RRPs) and poor access to information, as well as the lack of transparency and \npredictability of transactions and inadequate trade infrastructure at EAGA borders, are major \nfactors limiting compliance and the volume of trade. Most traders in BIMP-EAGA are small and \nmicro-entrepreneurs unfamiliar with conventional trading methods, and the resulting prevalence \nof  informal  trade  transactions  leaves  traders  vulnerable  to  rent-seeking.  Local  businesses\u2019 \nawareness  of  CIQS  RRPs  needs  to  be  enhanced  to  help  them  improve  their  business \nprocesses to meet the requirements of the international supply chain.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA is expected to be increased trade and tourism in BIMP-EAGA. The \nenvisioned outcome of the TA is faster movement of goods and people at the eight priority entry \npoints (footnote 6). This is expected to have spillover effects enhancing the efficiency of other \nentry  points  and  the  utilization  of  transport  infrastructure  and  links  connecting  subregional \nmarkets. The TA will complement progress in transport connectivity in BIMP-EAGA and help \nidentify opportunities for public and private investments in trade-related infrastructure. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will adopt a phased approach to implementing reforms, taking into consideration \nthe basic needs and resources available at each priority entry point. It will implement measures \nthat  can  produce  early  gains  for  trade.  Recognizing  the  notable  disparity  in  performance \nbetween EAGA entry points and national capital ports, reforms and capacity building that narrow \nthis development gap will be prioritized. This will be complemented with the strengthening of \ninstitutional mechanisms and public\u2013private partnership and the adoption of monitoring and \nreporting mechanisms to track progress. The benefits from initial demonstrational results would \nhelp create incentives and mobilize further support to move forward in subsequent stages when \ncountries review, update and reform their SOPs. The TA is expected to deliver two major \noutputs\u2014improved CIQS systems at priority entry points and better private sector compliance\u2014\nthrough the following.  \n \n1.  Improved CIQS Systems at Priority Entry Points \n \n12.  Validation of SOPs and rationalization of CIQS RRPs. The CIQS TF agreed that \ncountries will formulate SOPs to implement the MOU in the priority entry points. As of April 2010, \n ", "4   \nSOPs of three entry points, namely Muara Port (Brunei Darussalam), Sandakan Port (Malaysia) \nand General Santos (the Philippines), have been substantially completed, while those of other \npriority entry points are still subject to further refinement. The TA will support CIQS TF meetings \nto validate and review local SOPs and to discuss and endorse rationalized CIQS RRPs for each \nentry  point.  The  rationalization  of  CIQS  RRPs  will  simplify  clearance  procedures  and \nrequirements to facilitate legitimate trade in accordance with international standards without \nundermining  countries'  capacity  to  regulate  cross-border  activities.  For  this  reason,  the \ndevelopment of new working systems and procedures will be based on benchmarks drawn from \ninternational standards and best practices. Periodic time release studies7 will be conducted to \nassess  the  impact  of  initial  reforms  and  provide  diagnostic  analysis  to  guide  further \nimprovements in CIQS processes.  \n \n13.  Capacity building. The TA will assist the CIQS TF in assessing skills requirements; \ndeveloping capacity-building plans; and implement training, drills, and exercises to improve the \ncapacity of local CIQS officials to implement local trade-facilitation reforms. The TA will support \ninformation and communication technology-related improvements and training to pave the way \nfor the phased and pragmatic automation of trade transactions and services for more efficient \nand predictable transactions, better information sharing, and improved cooperation among local \nCIQS authorities.   \n \n14.  Institutional strengthening. The strengthening of the CIQS TF and its secretariat will \ncontinue under the TA to enable them to effectively coordinate and monitor the implementation \nof the MOU and SOPs across BIMP-EAGA, as well as conduct regular consultations and policy \ndialogue between CIQS agencies and the private sector and other EAGA clusters and working \ngroups. This will help identify trade-related issues and formulate solutions. The TA will support \nthe establishment of in-country institutional mechanisms to help integrate border management, \nparticularly at the port level.  \n \n2.  Increased Private Sector Compliance with CIQS RRPs \n \n15.  Public\u2013private  sector  partnership.  The  TA  will  support  the  BEBC\u2019s  conduct  of \nconsultations with local business communities to generate feedback on the effectiveness of \ntrade facilitation programs and formulate an advocacy agenda for discussion during its annual \ndialogue with the CIQS TF and the heads of customs. This will enable the BEBC to present the \nconstraints on the private sector and advocate for reforms that will support the private sector\u2019s \nparticipation in cross-border trade and integration with the global supply chain.  \n \n16.  Improving  compliance  with  CIQS  RRPs. The TA will address poor private sector \ncompliance  with  the  CIQS  requirements.  It  will  support  regular  consultations  with  and \nfamiliarization workshops for local CIQS agencies, port users, and other needed to implement \nBIMP-EAGA transport facilitation arrangements to generate awareness of CIQS reforms. The \nTA will support capacity building to develop authorized economic operators at each priority entry \npoint, who will benefit from fast-tracked clearance.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1.5 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on a \n                                                 \n7  Assessment tool developed by the World Customs Organisation to measure the time taken at each stage of the \nimportation process, from arrival of transportation vessel to removal of goods from the entry point premise. \n ", "  5\ngrant basis from the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund8 under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for $1 million, and by the Republic of Korea e-Asia \nand Knowledge Partnership Fund9 for $500,000. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency responsible for administering and implementing the \nTA. It will collaborate with the CIQS TF, other coordinating bodies at various level, and CIQS \nagencies. When necessary, it will consult the BIMP-EAGA Facilitation Centre and relevant \nBIMP-EAGA clusters and working groups. ADB will cooperate with such international technical \norganizations as the World Customs Organization, International Maritime Organization, and \nFood and Agriculture Organization, particularly in capacity building. The TA will be implemented \nover 36 months from July 2010 to June 2013. \n \n19.  The TA will finance about 59.5 person-months of consulting services, including 11.5 \nperson-months  of  international  consultancy  on  seven  technical  subjects:  (i)  customs,  (ii) \nimmigration, (iii) animal quarantine, (iv) fisheries quarantine, (v) health quarantine, (vi) plant \nquarantine, and (vii) maritime security. An additional 48 person-months of national consultancy \nwill  coordinate  with  government  agencies.  The  TA  will  tap  the  expertise  of  regional  and \ninternational technical organizations involved in CIQS and advertise opportunities in ADB\u2019s \nconsulting services recruitment notice for firms and/or individuals and assess the quality of \nresponse to define an appropriate method of selection. ADB will engage the consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nInformation  and  communication  technology  equipment  such  as  computers,  scanners,  fax \nmachines, and hand-held radios needed in the course of implementation will be procured in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook10. Upon the completion of the project, the equipment will be transferred \nto the participating governments in accordance with the PAI 5.11.11  \n \n20.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  through  the  BIMP-EAGA  webpage \nmaintained by the BIMP Facilitation Centre and ADB and at meetings of the BIMP-EAGA CIQS \nTF, heads of customs, and other clusters and working groups. The outcome of the TA will be \nreported to the annual BIMP-EAGA ministerial meeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility, and (ii) ADB administering technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea \ne-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  Support  for  Trade  Facilitation  in  the  Brunei \nDarussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  Established by the Government of Japan. \n9  Administered by ADB. \n10  ADB. 2008.
