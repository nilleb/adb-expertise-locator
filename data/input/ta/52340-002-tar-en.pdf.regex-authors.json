THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  health  indicators  have  shown  significant  and  continuous  improvement. \nAccording to the World Bank, between 2003 and 2018 the maternal mortality rate (MMR) dropped \nfrom 51 to 36 per 100,000 live births, while infant mortality rate (IMR) and the neonatal mortality \nrate (NMR) decreased between 2003 and 2017 from 46 to 20 and 26 to 12 per 1,000 live births, \nrespectively.1 Official statistics indicate an MMR of 17.7 per 100,000 live births in 2017.2 Despite \nthese improvements in health indicators, Uzbekistan\u2019s MMR, IMR, and NMR rates are still lagging \nbehind the World Bank estimated average3 mortality rates for the Europe and Central Asia region \nwhich are 16.0 for MMR, 8.6 for IMR and 5.1 for NRM (2015 estimates).4 The Government of \nUzbekistan has adopted the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs),5 and maternal and child health care (MCH) has become a main priority area of the \ngovernment policy which is reflected in all the national concepts, strategies, and programs.6 \n \n2.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  support  the  government  in  their  quest  of \nimproving the quality of perinatal care.7 The intended impact is a reduction of the maternal and \nneonatal mortality rates through an appropriate utilization of quality perinatal care services. There \nare four outputs: (i) perinatal centers modernized and upgraded; (ii) referral system strengthened; \n(iii) quality adherence at perinatal centers enhanced; and (iv) maternal health seeking behavior \nimproved.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The proposed Integrated Perinatal Care Project, aligns with the first operational strategy \nof ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which aims to achieve better health for all by improving the quality and \ncoverage  of  government  healthcare  services  and  supporting  to  improve  access  to  quality \nhealthcare services.8  \n \n4.   The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help the Government of Uzbekistan to \n(i) review the technical, economic and financial viability of the project and ascertain the project \nrationale, scope, cost, schedule, implementation arrangements, risks and mitigation measures; \n \n1  World Bank. 2017. https://data.worldbank.org/country/uzbekistan (accessed 25  August 2019). \nneonatal mortality rate, infant mortality rate: https://data.unicef.org/country/uzb/# (accessed 25 August 2019). \n2  A difference with the World Bank estimate which can be due to several factors such as the use different systems of \ncollecting data, different attribution of cause of death, and underreporting at facilities. \n3  World Bank. 2015/ https://data.worldbank.org/region/europe-and-central-asia (accessed 25 August 2019) and \nMaternal mortality rate: WHO, 2015.

Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output 1: Feasibility study and project due diligence undertaken. This will include       \n(i) assisting in the preparation of all documents required for project processing, including linked \ndocuments  and  project  administration  manual,  (ii)  preparation  of  bidding  documents  for \nprocurement of goods and works contracts and request(s) for proposals for recruitment of project \nimplementation support consultants, and (iii) project implementation startup support.  \n \n6.  An inspection of equipment at the perinatal health facilities and investigation of the \ninfrastructure (i.e. buildings, wards) in which the new medical equipment will be operationalized \nwill lead to a detailed needs assessment in terms of equipment and infrastructure of the perinatal \ncenters. A survey into the reasons of the observed delay of women seeking maternal health care \nwill lead to the preparation of terms of reference (TOR) to improve maternal health seeking \nbehavior. The baseline assessment for the project will establish baseline indicators for bed \noccupancy rates, intramural maternal mortality rates, and other relevant indicators to be agreed \nwith the government for the project.  \n \n7.  A review of the existing electronic medical records (EMRs) will form the basis for the TOR \nfor the design of a fully functional EMR intended for system wide use, and to be integrated into \nthe National Integrated Health Management Information System (NIHMIS). Finally, an appraisal \nof the current (intramural) quality of perinatal care and current licensing and attestation practices \nwill contribute to the preparation of the TOR for the design of a tailored training and capacity \nbuilding plan for perinatal and primary healthcare staff, while strengthening the professional \nattestation.  \n \n8.  Output 2: Perinatal services delivery plan for Fergana Valley performed. A pilot \nhealth  sector  master  plan,  perinatal  services  delivery  plan  (PSDP)  in  the  Fergana  Valley                 \n(i.e. Fergana, Namangan and Andijan Regions) will be elaborated. All health facilities providing \nor contributing to perinatal care, including the primary healthcare level facilities, will be mapped \nand, based on population projections and disease profiles, a forecasting of health services needs \nin terms of beds, facilities and staffing will be made. A software tool in Microsoft Excel for national \nroll-out of the hospital masterplan will be handed over to the Ministry of Health (MOH).  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The technical assistance (TA) is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $1,200,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. \n \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  Eligible expenditures include: (i) consultant services, and (ii) non-consultant costs for local \ntraining  and  workshops, minimal  equipment  such  as  computers,  etc.,  and  operating  costs \n \nessential to carry out the TA, including vehicle rental, if justified. Non-consultant costs should be \nkept to a minimum. The following are ineligible expenditures: (i) purchase of vehicles, (ii) salaries \nfor civil servants, (iii) foreign travel,(iv) scholarships or long internships, (v) detailed engineering \n \n \n9 TA to be published online in November 2019.  \n ", "  3 \ndesign, (vi) civil works and other related expenses, and (vii) those under ADB\u2019s List of Ineligible \nItems (or Negative List) and Prohibited Investment Activities List. \n \n11.
