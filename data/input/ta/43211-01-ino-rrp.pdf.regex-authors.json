I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Indonesia for the Sixth Development Policy Support Program (DPSP-6). \n \n2.  The program will support the government\u2019s key reform priorities aimed at achieving \nhigher and pro-poor economic growth that is sustainable over the medium term. The reform \npriorities  include  efforts  to  improve  the  investment  climate,  strengthen  public  financial \nmanagement, and governance, and enhance poverty reduction and access to public service \ndelivery. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The development policy letter \nis in Appendix 3. Appendix 4 presents the policy matrix for the program.  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The proposed program is the sixth and last of a series of Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) development policy support programs (DPSPs) for Indonesia, prepared jointly with the \nWorld Bank and the Government of Japan. Since its initiation, the DPSP series was designed to \nsupport the Government of Indonesia\u2019s medium-term reform agenda in core areas underpinned \nby its National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN). The focus of the DPSP series has \nevolved since 2003, reflecting changes in the country\u2019s needs and priorities. In first four years, \nthe emphasis was on ensuring medium-term macroeconomic stability and building the basic \nlegal and regulatory framework for investment as well as public financial management and \ngovernance.  As  macroeconomic  resilience  improved,  the  government  and  development \npartners agreed to replace the macroeconomic pillar with support for reforms in public service \ndelivery. Since 2007, the DPSP series has focused on three core policy areas: the investment \nclimate, public financial management and governance, and poverty reduction and public service \ndelivery. In 2009, some of the reforms envisaged during the last 5-year plan period remained \nunfinished. At the request of the government, the proposed DPSP-6 was included for 2010 in \nADB\u2019s  Indonesia  country  operations  business  plan,  2010\u20132012. 1 The  DPSP  series  has \ncomplemented  implementation  of  other  ADB  programs,  including  the  Public  Expenditure \nSupport  Facility,  Countercyclical  Support  Facility,  and,  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance Reform.2 \n \n4.  The program completion reports for the first three programs under the DPSP series \nsuggested that policy actions supported by the series have contributed significantly to improved \neconomic management, albeit from a low base.3 Among other achievements, the program has \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: Indonesia, 2010\u20132012, Manila. The government agreed to ADB\u2019s \nexit from the series starting in 2011. The World Bank and the Government of Japan will extend its Development \nPolicy Loan (DPL) support with a new cluster for 2010\u20132012. ADB will continue to provide support through TAs on \nprocurement and audit in coordination with other development partners and participate in enhancing poverty \nreduction and access to public service delivery through the PNPM Mandiri with an infrastructure focus. ADB will \nalso continue to support policy reforms in decentralization, climate change, capital markets development, and \ninfrastructure. \n2  ADB. 2009.

A joint program completion report will be prepared for DPSP-4 to DPSP-6. ", "2 \nhelped the government devise a public debt management strategy, reorient budget savings from \nreduction  in  fuel  subsidies  toward  priority  social  sectors  and  targeted  poverty  reduction \nprograms, and expand the tax base through tax administration reforms. Under the fourth DPSP \nonward, reforms to improve the investment climate have led to the passage of an Investment \nLaw,  a  significant  reduction  in  business  start-up  time,  a  shorter  time  for  value-added  tax \nrefunds, and enhanced access of small and medium-sized enterprises to finance. Reforms in \npublic financial management and governance have improved budget formulation, execution, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluation.  The  DPSP  series  has  supported  efforts  to  increase  budget \nallocation  for  poverty  programs,  improve  pro-poor  planning  and  budgeting,  and  enhance \ncommunity-driven development under the government\u2019s PNPM Mandiri. \n   \n5.  While  significant  progress  has  been  achieved,  the  government  is  committed  to \nimplementing further reforms in DPSP core reform areas. Recent economic growth remains \nbelow the level achieved before the Asian financial crisis. To achieve higher and more inclusive \ngrowth,  a  recent  ADB  study  suggests  the  need  to  accelerate  infrastructure  development, \nimprove governance and institutions, and enhance access to better education.4 Despite recent \nimprovement in economic competitiveness indicators,5 efforts are needed to improve trade \nlogistics  and  simplify  business  procedures.  Continued  efforts  are  needed  to  implement  a \nmodern  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system.  While  significant  progress  has  been \nachieved, poverty rates remain high. Poverty incidence declined to 13.3% in 2010, but rates \nvary widely among regions and about 40% of the population is estimated to be near poor \n(clustered just above the national poverty line), making them highly vulnerable to fall back into \npoverty.  The  government\u2019s  new  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014  adopted  a  three-pillar  development \nstrategy: pro-growth, pro-jobs, and pro-poor. The government recognizes the need to increase \nprivate investment to support its pro-jobs growth strategy. It also recognizes that continued \nimprovement  in  the  investment  climate,  governance,  public  service  delivery,  and  poverty \nreduction are crucial to achieving its pro-poor objective. Therefore, the three core policy areas \nsupported under the DPSP-6 are among the 11 priorities in the RPJMN, 2010\u20132014.   \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the DPSP-6 will be to achieve higher pro-poor economic growth that is \nsustained over the medium term. The outcome will be improved overall economic management \nanchored on good governance, which will help generate more and better jobs, and contribute to \nsustainable poverty reduction.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.  The DPSP-6 supports the government\u2019s efforts in three core reform areas: (i) improve \nthe  investment  climate,  (ii)  strengthen  public  financial  management  and  governance,  and \n(iii) enhance poverty reduction and access to public service delivery. All 13 policy actions for the \nDPSP-6 identified during preparation of the DPSP-5 have been completed to a satisfactory level \nof  reform.  Five  new  policy  actions  have  been  added  to  reflect  the  priorities  of  the  new \ngovernment, which took office in October 2009, have been satisfactorily completed.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB.  2010.  Indonesia:  Critical  Development  Constraints.  Manila.  ADB  supports  the  government\u2019s  effort  to \naccelerate infrastructure development through the Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program; ADB. 2009. \nReport and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the Republic of \nIndonesia for the Second Infrastructure Reform Sector Development Program., Manila.  \n5  According to the World Economic Forum, Indonesia\u2019s competitiveness ranking improved 10 places to 44 in 2010. \n ", "3 \n1.  Improve Investment Climate  \n \n8.  Improving the investment climate continues to be a key priority in the government\u2019s \nreform  agenda.  As  outlined  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014,  the  country  will  need  significant \ninvestment to elevate its growth to 6%\u20137% in the medium term. The government at most can \nprovide about 20% of the overall required investment (about $1.3 trillion). Hence, facilitating \ndomestic and foreign private investment is urgently needed. The prospects for investing in \nIndonesia are quite promising, given its significant population and natural resources. Therefore, \nthe  RPJMN  places  a  high  priority  on  harmonizing  policies  and  regulations,  streamlining \nprocedures,  promoting  customs  and  trade  facilitation,  and  improving  infrastructure  and \nstrengthening the financial sector to support a sound investment climate. Given the need to \nenlarge  the  fiscal  space  to  support  infrastructure  and  other  poverty  reduction  programs, \nimproving the performance of the tax system is a medium-term objective of the reform agenda.  \n \n9.  Supported by the DPSP-6, the government implemented a number of reform initiatives \nto address some of those constraints by issuing a revised investment negative list, simplifying \ninvestment licensing procedures, establishing a national single window, developing a national \nlogistics blueprint, and strengthening tax administration organization and business processes. \n \n10.  Investment  negative  list.  While  the  July  2007  investment  negative  list  was  more \ndetailed  and  comprehensive  than  previous  negative  lists\u2014hence  more  transparent\u2014it \nintroduced new restrictions in key sectors such as telecommunications, health, shipping, ports, \nlogistics,  pharmaceuticals,  and  insurance.  It  also  failed  to  clarify  issues  relating  to  how \nincumbent investors in these sectors would be treated (grandfather clause). In response to \nconcerns raised by industry, Presidential Regulation No. 36/2010 to revise the investment \nnegative list was issued on 25 May 2010. The regulation addresses investor concerns regarding \nthe grandfather clause, the treatment of publicly listed companies, mergers and acquisitions, \nand the hierarchy of regulations related to investment in Indonesia. It also opens up a few \nadditional sectors to all foreign investors and incorporates Indonesia\u2019s commitments to the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), providing more liberal treatment for ASEAN \ncompanies. (Completed.) \n \n11.  Online investment  licensing  system. The Investment Law, 2007, stipulates that a \npresidential regulation on one-door integrated investment service (PTSP) shall be issued. A \npresidential regulation was issued on 23 June 2009 to allow ministries and central government \nagencies to delegate their authority to issue business licenses to the Investment Board (BKPM) \nand authorizes BKPM to establish a one-stop integrated services for investment licensing. \nBKPM issued Regulation No. 11/2009 guiding implementation of PTSP and developed an online \ninvestment licensing application system that is now accessible on the BKPM website. A pilot of \nthe system was launched in January 2010 in Batam, and it has been implemented in Jakarta \nand seven cities. The government is planning to implement the system in the capital city of each \nprovince and numerous districts by December 2010. (Completed.) \n \n12.  National single window. The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) issued \nDecision No. 5/2010 to form a national team for implementation of the national single window \n(NSW) and to appoint the Directorate General Customs as an interim operator of the NSW until \n2012. A  model was launched in January 2010 in five major ports throughout Indonesia, which is \na major step toward reducing the time and cost for importing and exporting by allowing single \nsubmission, single processing, and single approval of import or export documents.6 In 2009, up \n                                                 \n6  In  implementing  NSW,  the  government  has  received  assistance  from  ASEAN,  the  Asia-Pacific  Economic \nCooperation, and other development partners. \n ", "4 \nto 36 government agencies were involved in granting permits or licenses for export or import \nand a large number of documents were required (48 for export and 106 for import). With the \nNSW,  these  procedures  are  expected  to  be  simplified  significantly.  (New  policy  action: \ncompleted.)  \n \n13.  National  logistics  blueprint.  The  government  has  developed  a  National  Logistics \nBlueprint (NLB) and Action with three main objectives: (i) ensure the availability of strategic \ncommodities at affordable prices, (ii) reduce logistics costs to facilitate the competitiveness of \nexport products, and (iii) prepare the country for better market integration with ASEAN. The NLB \npresents a detailed program for 2010\u20132014, and encompasses a comprehensive action plan \nthat will require the participation and coordination of a large number of government departments \nand agencies. The NLB distinguishes quick wins and an overall strategy with priority actions for \nthe coming years. Some of the quick wins were included in the government\u2019s 100-day program \nimplemented since the beginning of 2010, such as the introduction of full time services in main \nseaports, the development of dry ports in major industrial areas, the extension of the railway into \nthe port of Jakarta, and the expansion of Jakarta and Surabaya ports. A draft presidential \ndecree to implement the NLB has been submitted for approval. (New policy action: completed.)  \n \n14.  Tax  administration  reform.  Continued  reform  in  tax  administration  has  increased \nregistered taxpayers from 4.8 million in 2006 to 18.1 million in 2010, but the increased number \nhas not led to larger tax collections. The next phase of tax administration reform will continue \nthe effort to reduce tax gaps and introduce new systems and procedures that facilitate  a \ntaxpayer-centered approach to improve voluntary compliance. The focus is on strengthening the \nself-assessment  system  and  streamlining  business  processes,  improving  the  quality  and \nintegrity  of  the  tax  database,  introducing  risk-based  compliance  enforcement,  improving \nprofessionalism and staff integrity, strengthening governance, and increasing the information \nand communications technology capability to support the entire tax operations. To support this \neffort, the Directorate General of Taxation (DGT) is planning to implement the Project for \nIndonesia  Tax  Administration  Reform  (PINTAR)  to  strengthen  (i)  taxpayer  registration, \n(ii) returns  and  payments  processing,  (iii)  the  taxpayer  and  revenue  accounts  database, \n(iv) centralized document management, (v) risk-based audit and collection, and (vi) information \ntechnology infrastructure. The government initially planned to issue a contract for PINTAR in \nmid-2010.  However,  the  completion  of  PINTAR  design  was  slightly  delayed.  DGT  has \nadvertised the procurement of the PINTAR; implementation is expected to begin in early 2011 to \nensure that the reform program can be completed as scheduled by early 2014. (Satisfactorily \ncompleted.)  \n \n2.  Strengthen Public Financial Management and Governance  \n \n15.  The government has embarked on a broad-based and ambitious reform agenda since \nadopting a new regulatory framework for public finance management in 2003 and 2004.7 While \nprogress has been substantial and reforms are moving in the right direction, a long list of \nchallenges  remains.  The  program  supports  efforts  to  advance  PFM  reform  focusing  on  a \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) and performance-based budgeting (PBB), better \ncash forecasting and management, an integrated financial management information system, \nprocurement, management of state assets, and the audit systems. \n \n16.  Budget program structure and indicative ceiling for 2011 budget. The State Finance \nLaw,  2003,  mandated  three  pillars  of  budget  reform:  (i)  a  unified  budget  to  remove  the \n                                                 \n7  The most noteworthy laws issued include the State Finance Law No. 17/2003, the State Treasury Law No. 1/2004, \nand the State Financial Audit Law No. 15/2004. \n ", "5 \ndistinction  between  development  expenditure  and  routine  expenditure,  and  allow  for \nprioritization across all kinds of expenditures in the budget; (ii) an MTEF that aims to strengthen \nthe capability to plan and prioritize expenditures for the medium term; and (iii) PBB, which would \nrestructure  the  budget  according  to  programs  and  activities  and  associated  performance \nindicators, and allow for results-based evaluation and budget allocation. The unified budget was \nimplemented in the 2005 budget. PBB and the MTEF moved into an implementation phase in \n2009 with the issuance of a manual prepared jointly by the Directorate General Budget and the \nNational Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS). The new program structure has been \nfinalized and incorporated in the RPJMN, 2010\u20132014. The government issued Presidential \nDecree No. 5/2010 to regulate the establishment of the indicative ceilings for the 2011 budget \nbased on the revised structure. (Completed.) \n \n17.  Cash forecasting. The Ministry of Finance issued Regulation No.192/2009 on cash \nforecasting. With this new regulation, the idle cash balance kept at the Treasury Single Account \nat the Central Bank of Indonesia is expected to be minimized and the interest investment of \ncash surpluses maximized. This regulation also requires spending units to submit in-year cash \nwithdrawal  plans  to  the  State  Treasury  Service  Office  (KPPN)  to  periodically  update  the \ndisbursement plans included in their approved budget allocations (DIPA). The spending units \nare required to submit their updated cash plan at least 3 days before the end of each month, or \nthe cash cannot be withdrawn. A new information technology application has been developed to \nsupport this initiative. (Completed.) \n \n18.  Business process improvement and chart of accounts. A report covering the state \nbudget and state treasury business process improvement was completed in September 2010. \nThe report covers areas including (i) the budget planning and preparation process, (ii) budget \nenactment and budget revisions, (iii)  budget execution rules, (iv) revised budget structure and \nchart of accounts, and (v) project and activity costing. (Completed.) \n  \n19.  Database for state assets management. Law No. 1/2004 on the state treasury and its \nimplementing government regulation No. 6/ 2006 on state or local government assets require \nthat land belonging to the state or local governments shall be legally registered or certified \nunder the name of the central government or respective local government. Much of the state-\nowned land is not yet registered or legally certified by the National Land Authority Board (BPN). \nIn November 2009, the finance minister and head of BPN signed two joint decrees on land \ncertification  (Decree  No.  186/2009  and  No.  24/2009)  that  provide  legal  certainty  on  the \nownership  of  state  land  and  protecting  the  security  of  state  assets.  The  stock-taking  and \nappraisal process of state assets is progressing. A completion report\u2014for all civilian state \nassets\u2014was submitted the President. (Satisfactorily completed.) \n  \n20.  Public procurement. The past 3 years have witnessed improvements in the public \nprocurement environment. Presidential decree (Keppres) No. 80/2003 provided a national public \nprocurement regulation that meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international \npractice, including basic principles\u2014transparency, open competition, economy, and efficiency. \nThis decree also paved the way for establishing the National Public Procurement Office (LKPP). \nA key priority of LKPP is to improve the regulatory framework for public procurement. In this \neffort, LKPP is taking a two-pronged strategy: the preparation of a new procurement law and the \nrevision  of  Keppres  No.  80/2003.  LKPP  has  completed  the  academic  papers  on  the \nprocurement law and public consultation has started on the draft law. The preparation and \nenactment of a new procurement law will have to go through a lengthy process. LKPP has \nfinalized  a new  Presidential  Regulation  No.  54/2010  to  replace  Keppres  80  as  an  interim \nmeasure, which requires the establishment of procurement service units, the use of national \n ", "6 \nstandard bidding documents, and other improvement. ADB has supported the government in \nthis reform through technical assistance (TA, para. 28). (Completed.) \n \n21.  Internal audit. The public expenditure and financial accountability assessment of 20088 \nclassifies the internal audit function in the country as fragmented and characterized by weak \ncapacity. Presidential Regulation No. 60/2008 is the cornerstone for government internal control \nand audit systems. Through this regulation clarifies the roles and responsibilities of various \nplayers in the internal audit such as the Financial and Development Supervisory Board (BPKP), \nInspectorate Generals, and local government inspectorates. However, there is still a need for a \nregulation to lay out in more detail the mechanisms of how those roles and responsibilities \nwould be implemented, particularly in the planning, executing, reporting and follow up of internal \naudit at each level. The DPSP-6 requires submission of a draft presidential decree for approval. \nThe draft presidential decree has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance. (Satisfactorily \ncompleted.)  \n \n22.  Accrual-based accounting. Financial reports prepared on an accrual basis are more \neffective both for accountability and decision making. The government has made early progress \nin  this  area.  A  draft  presidential  regulation  on  Government  Accounting  Standards  and \nimplementation of accrual accounting was submitted for approval in July 2010. The target is to \nswitch to full accrual accounting by 2015. The draft standards is expected to be issued in late \n2010. (Completed.)  \n \n3.  Enhance Poverty Reduction and Access to Public Service Delivery   \n \n23.  The government has implemented a number of programs for social assistance and \npoverty reduction across all clusters in the past 5 years. These include an unconditional cash \ntransfer program (BLT), conditional cash transfer, health insurance for the poor (JAMKESMAS) \nand the National Community Empowerment Program (PNPM Mandiri). ADB has supported the \ngovernment in this area through the PNPM Mandiri with an infrastructure focus.9 While progress \nhas been achieved through these programs, the government is committed to intensify policy \nreforms in this area to accelerate the pace of poverty reduction over the next 5 years. These \nreforms include institutionalizing program assessment and improved governance accountability \nto support overall coordination, implementation, and assessment of the programs; improving \naccuracy  in  measuring  poverty  and  developing  a  national  targeting  system  to  ensure  that \nprogram  benefits  reach  the  poor  and  vulnerable;  and  empowering  local  governments, \ncommunities, and service providers to deliver quality services as an effective approach to \nleverage  local  knowledge  to  identify  obstacles  to  development  while  building  capacity  for \ncoordinated action. \n \n24.  Governance and institutional accountability. Fragmentation and lack of coordination \nhave  limited  the  effectiveness  of  national  poverty  reduction  programs.  To  address  these \nproblems, the government has reorganized the institutional arrangements in this policy area. It \nissued Presidential Regulation No. 15/2010 to form a national team for the Acceleration of \nPoverty Reduction (TNP2K), which consists of all the government agencies responsible for the \nplanning, financing, and implementation of poverty reduction programs. The team has been \nestablished  to  guide  and  oversee  the  reform  of  poverty  reduction  policies  and  programs. \nChaired by the vice president, the team will lead the coordination and oversight of all poverty \n                                                 \n8  World Bank. 2008.

The team \nwill be supported by an executive secretariat responsible for preparing policies through its \nworking groups that will act as internal think tanks to commission research, draft policies, and \nsupport improvements in program design and integration. One of the working groups will assess \nthe  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  poverty  reduction  programs  through  monitoring  and \nevaluation activities. The findings from both monitoring and evaluation activities will inform the \ndecision of the national team about program mix, scale, and budget allocations. (New policy \naction: completed.)  \n \n25.  Unified  database  for  poor  household  and  families. Household poverty reduction \nprograms currently use different targeting approaches and rely on separate recipient databases. \nThis leads to duplication of efforts, inconsistency in application, and dampened program impact. \nTo address these problems, the executive secretariat plans to establish a national targeting \nsystem, which is one of the strategic objectives of the RPJMN, 2010\u20132014. Such a system will \nfeature a unified database of poor households, from which implementing agencies can draw \nbeneficiary lists for individual programs. TNP2K has issued a policy note recommending the \nestablishment of a national unified database of poor households and families and national \ntargeting  system,  including  steps  involved  and  agencies  participating  in  the  process.  The \nprogram initially only required preparation of a budget submission for this initiative for 2011. \n(Completed.) \n \n26.  Methodology of calculating poverty line.  The Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) is \nrevising the methodology of poverty line calculation and will expand the list of indicators from 14 \nto 56. This will improve the accuracy in identifying the poor and measuring poverty rates. The \nrevision of national poverty line methodology will involve (i) completion of national poverty line \nsimulation using the alternative measurement, and (ii) conducting internal consultation to review \nthe  new  method  between  BPS  and  key  government  stakeholders.  (New  policy  action: \ncompleted.) \n \n27.  Community-based  poverty  reduction  programs.  The  fiduciary  systems  of  the \nprogram have come under stress with the national expansion of the PNPM Mandiri. To ensure \nthat the fiduciary systems remain robust, the government has developed an action plan with \nspecific deliverables, including (i) communication of political will with zero tolerance on fraud \nand corruption; (ii) strengthening of systems to monitor, report, and act on fraud and corruption \ncases; and (iii) strengthening of capacity through the involvement of the attorney general, \nBawasda (Regional Development Supervisory Body), and through the appointment of additional \nfiduciary staff in high-risk areas. Another specific action plan is to publish complaints, case \ndetails,  and  resolution  status.  In  addition,  the  government  has  made  a  formal  agreement \nbetween  BPKP  and  related  regional  agencies  to  support  BPKP  in  PNPM  audits.  A \nmemorandum of understanding for audit of the PNPM in 2010 was signed by all parties in \nAugust 2010. To monitor all the corruption cases, the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry \nof Public Works submit quarterly reports detailing the status of the cases to the national team \nand to the Joint Management Committee members. (New policy action: completed.)  \n \n28.  Technical  assistance  and  further  ADB  support.  ADB  has  supported  the \nimplementation of policy actions under this program by providing TA to LKPP and through the \nState Audit Reform project supporting the audit agencies.10 Although the DPSP series will end \nin 2011, ADB support in the key reform areas supported by the program will continue.

To support PFM reform at the local government level, \nADB  has  provided  capacity  building  TA  linked  to  the  Local  Government  Financial  and \nGovernance  Reform  Program  series.  The  second  subprogram  of  the  Local  Government \nFinancial and Governance Reform Program cluster is scheduled for consideration by ADB\u2019s \nBoard of Directors in 2011. \n \nD.  Program Costs and Financing \n \n29.  The loan amount is based on the strengths of the policy package, its development \nimpact, the importance of sectors covered, investment needs, and indicative costs of reforms.   \nThe policy actions of the proposed program are derived from the government\u2019s medium-term \nreform  priorities  as  set  out  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.  They  are  crucial  in  achieving  the \ngovernment\u2019s  pro-growth,  pro-jobs,  and  pro-poor  strategy.  Implementation  of  some  policy \nreforms also requires investments such as the NSW, enhancing tax administration, increasing \naudit capacity, and simplifying investment licenses. Reduction of income and corporate tax rates \nintroduces adjustment costs that need to be recovered through improved tax administration. \nWith increased focus on poverty reduction, the government will also scale up spending on social \nassistance  and  poverty  programs  such  as  the  PNPM  Mandiri  and  other  social  assistance \nprograms. The government\u2019s budget financing needs for 2010 are an estimated $20.4 billion, of \nwhich programmed official external borrowing amounts to $7.7 billion. The government has \nrequested a loan of $200 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance the \nprogram. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an annual \ninterest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The World Bank \nwill provide parallel cofinancing support of $600 million through its DPL-7 and the Government \nof Japan will provide $100 million.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n30.  The  CMEA  is  the  executing  agency  for  the program,  collaborating  closely  with  the \nMinistry of Finance. Implementation of the DPSP-6 actions is being undertaken by a number of \nother ministries and agencies, including the Vice President\u2019s Office, the National Development \nPlanning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  the  Investment  Coordination  Board,  several  directorates \ngeneral in the Ministry of Finance, BPS, and the National Public Procurement Agency, among \nothers.  Extensive  consultations  were  held  between  the  development  partners  (ADB,  the \nGovernment of Japan, and the World Bank) and the government, led by a steering committee \nchaired by the CMEA on formulating the policy actions. Monitoring the implementation and \nattainment of the DPSP policy actions is done through several mechanisms. These include \nmonitoring  committees  and/or  technical  groups  established  by  the  government  that  are \nresponsible for ensuring the implementation of policy actions as well as follow-up on progress; \nand regular joint government\u2013development partner meetings to discuss interim progress in \nachieving agreed milestones in the reform agenda. The program period is from November 2009 \nto December 2010; the program loan of $200 million is to be disbursed when the government \nhas  met  the  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \ndisbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement \nProcedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.11  \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "9 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Governance \n \n31.  In almost all areas of PFM, changes in the legal and regulatory architecture are largely \ncomplete  and  the  momentum  has  shifted  toward  implementation  of  new  PFM  practices. \nAdvances have been made in budget preparation with the introduction of the MTEF and PBB, \ngovernment accounting standards have been formally established and are being adhered to in \nseveral respects to produce comprehensive annual financial statements, and the external audit \nfunction  has  made  significant  progress  in  the  past  5  years.  However,  challenges  remain, \nincluding (i) improving internal controls in the execution of budget by spending agencies; (ii) \nestablishing  the  government  financial  management  information  system,  which  provides \ninformation for budget management at all levels of the government; and (iii) strengthening \ncontrols in budget execution processes to fully realize the gains from reforms introduced in other \nareas of PFM. The government continues to prioritize PFM reforms and development partners \nsupport implementation of reforms in this area. When implemented, the reforms will contribute \nto reducing the level of fiduciary risk to low in the medium term. The World Bank considers \nIndonesia\u2019s  PFM  system  to  be  adequate  to  receive  DPL  and  DPSP  support.  A  detailed \nassessment of the attendant fiduciary risks with respect to this DPSP operation is accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n \n32.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government of Indonesia and the CMEA.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Social \n \n33.  Both the improvement of the investment climate and strengthening of PFM systems are \nexpected to have significant poverty and social benefits. The measures aimed at increasing \ninvestment  (including  foreign  direct  investment)  and  raising  export  competitiveness  are \ndesigned to support a virtuous cycle of growth, job generation, and productivity gains leading to \nopportunities,  improved  livelihoods,  and  poverty  reduction.  Simplification  of  the  business \nlicensing  procedures  is  expected  to  contribute  to  the  growth  of  small  and  medium-sized \nenterprises,  which  can  have  a  great  impact  on  employment.  Tax  reform  actions  that  will \ncontribute  to  increased  revenue  collection  and  better  fiscal  management  will  allow  the \ngovernment  to  dedicate  more  resources  to  pro-poor  programs.  Improvements  in  budget \npreparation  and  budget  execution  systems  are  expected  to  lead  to  more  efficient  service \ndelivery and will allow social programs to have a greater impact on the targeted population. The \npolicy reforms supported under the DPSP-6 have the potential to benefit women through other \ninitiatives on poverty reduction and service delivery in line with the government priorities, as \nstated in the RPJMN, 2010\u20132014. Improved PFM capacity will facilitate implementation of a \ngender-responsive budget currently being pilot tested in a number of key ministries. ADB has \nsupported the government\u2019s poverty program through the PNPM Mandiri. The policy actions to \nsupport  improvement  in  implementation  of  PNPM  Mandiri  under  the  DPSP-6  will  enhance \nwomen\u2019s capacity in raising their voice in local development planning and processes.  \n \nC.  Safeguards \n \n34.  The program does not trigger ADB\u2019s safeguard policies and is categorized C for the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following are agreed upon, \nand  will  be  incorporated  in  the  legal  agreement.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \n ", "10 \nprogram. The government agrees to cooperate, and shall cause any and all government offices, \norganizations, and entities involved in implementing the program to cooperate fully with any \nsuch investigation and extend all necessary assistance, including access to all relevant books \nand records, as may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of any such investigation. \n \nD.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n35.  The  program  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  RPJMN,  2010\u20132014.  The  assumptions \nunderlying the program include the following: (i) domestic political and macroeconomic stability \nis maintained, (ii) the economy is able to withstand external economic shocks, and (iii) the \ngovernment retains the reform momentum and is able to forge a consensus among relevant \nagencies and the public on the reform agenda. The program has three main risks (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk  Mitigating Measures \nUnanticipated global or regional  The government is undertaking measures to strengthen its monetary policy \nshocks may affect Indonesia\u2019s  framework, expand the tax base, and strengthen public expenditure \neconomy  management, with the assistance of development partners including the \n  Asian Development Bank. \n \nWeak interagency coordination  The program reduces this risk by focusing on the policy triggers that \ncapacity  constitute high-priority, high-impact policy reforms with some meaningful \ndegree of implementing capacity. Increasing external competition and \nincreased public demand for a better development outcome provide an \nopportunity to build consensus among stakeholders on difficult policy reform \nissues and accelerate structural reforms to strengthen economic growth. \nCapacity constraints slow the pace  The program focuses on efforts to support the government\u2019s own initiatives \nof policy reforms and reduce the  and reforms in areas where there is political will.

The government and the CMEA have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the loan document. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n37.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$200,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia for the Sixth Development Policy Support Program \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n19 November 2010 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and Indicators with  Reporting  Assumptions  \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption\nHigher pro-poor economic  Real GDP growth increased to 6.5%\u20137.0% in  BPS  Macroeconomic and \ngrowth that is sustained  2012 from 6% in 2010    political stability \nover the medium term       \nPoverty rate decreased to 12% in 2012 from  BPS  Risks \n13.3% in 2010    Slow pace of reforms \n     \nCorruption Perceptions Index  improved     Transparency  Public opposition to \n(from 2.8 in 2010)   International   reforms \n \nOutcome      Assumption\nImproved overall  Increased investment to GDP ratio (from  BPS  Economy is able to \neconomic management  23.4% in 2009 to 25% in 2011)    withstand external or \nanchored on good      domestic shocks \ngovernance  Increase in the value of net foreign direct  BI and BPS   \ninvestment inflows (from $4.9 billion in 2009    Risk \nto $10 billion in 2011)     Reversal large foreign \n    capital inflows  \nIncreased percentage of capital expenditures  MOF \ndisbursed in the first half of the year (from   \n20% in the first half of 2010 to 30% in 2011)   \n   \nIncreased percentage of public expenditure   \nallocated to social assistance programs (from  MOF \n3.8% in 2009 to 4.0% in 2011)   \n \nOutputs       Assumptions\n1.
