THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance facility (F-TRTA) will provide project preparation \nsupport to a series of ensuing projects, comprising the: (i) Regional Gas Transmission Efficiency \nEnhancement Project ($300 million), (ii) Distribution Network Modernization Program ($300 \nmillion), and (iii) Regional Energy Transmission and Dispatch Enhancement Project ($400 million). \nAll ensuing projects are among the Government of Uzbekistans priorities for energy sector \ndevelopment under Uzbekistan\u2019s 2030 strategy.1 These projects will require similar preparation, \ndue diligence, design and readiness activities, and this F-TRTA will reduce transaction costs \nthrough minimizing the need for stand-alone transaction technical assistance.  \n \n2.  Uzbekistan\u2019s economy is at the crossroads. Weakening commodity, export prices and a \ndownturn in trading partners\u2019 import demand is slowing down economic growth from its average \nrate of 8% to 5% in 2017.2 In turn, Uzbekistan has embarked on a series of far-reaching reforms \nto boost its economy, including liberalizing foreign exchanges and initiating structural reforms of \nstate enterprises. The energy sector has underpinned Uzbekistan\u2019s sustained growth, with an \nestimated share of 20% of the gross domestic product and 30% of national tax revenues. Natural \ngas considered as the most important indigenous source of energy and one of the driving forces \nof the country\u2019s economy comprises over 80% of the country\u2019s energy mix and 85% of electricity \ngenerated.  \n \n3.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  aging  and  dilapidated  infrastructure  in  the  whole  energy  supply  chain \nincreasingly results in system inefficiencies, unreliable gas and electricity supply that dampens \nthe economic development and business confidence, and uneven access to energy across \nprovinces  contributing  towards  widening  regional  income  disparities.  The  obsolete  energy \ntransmission  and  distribution  system  has  developed  serious  problems  overtime,  such  as \nincreasingly frequent electricity blackouts and insufficient gas especially during peak demand \ntimes in the winter, putting social service systems, such as education and health care, at risk.  \n \n4.  Uzbekistan's aging gas infrastructure and network underinvestment have led to supply \nshortages, inefficiency, high losses and low reliability. Built more than 50 years ago, the gas \ntransmission system consists of a complex network of high- and medium-pressure pipelines \nequipped with physically degraded compressors with less than 30% of available capacity and \nlacking any centralized functions to measure, monitor, and control supply and demand. Most \ntransmission facilities have not been tested or inspected for the past 30 years. Lack of periodic \nmaintenance  and  insufficient  capital  investments  resulted  in  technical  losses  of  15%  and \nequivalent  of  Uzbekistan\u2019s  gas  export  volumes.  Without  adequate  capital  investment  in \ntransmission modernization, automation, management of a system of this size, gas transportation \nremains highly decentralized and underutilized that leads to higher maintenance cost, greater \noperational risks and economic and financial losses. This imperils Uzbekistan energy security and \nconstrain the national economy growth. \n \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2015. Uzbekistan Towards 2030: Transition to the Resource-efficient Growth Model. \nTashkent. The proposed F-TRTA is included in the Country Operations Business Plan 2019-2021 for Uzbekistan \n(ADB. 2018. Uzbekistan: Country Operations Business Plan (2019\u20132021). Manila. https://www.adb.org/documents/ \nuzbekistan-country-operations-business-plan-2019-2021).  The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  ADB \nassistance for the ensuing projects (the amounts indicated in paragraph 1 are for ADB financing).  \n2  ADB. 2018. Asian Development Outlook Update. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  The energy supply is increasingly becoming unreliable because of degraded infrastructure \nalong the electricity supply chain and insufficient investments for rehabilitation. Compounded by \nthe regional disparities in indigenous energy resources such as natural gas, hydropower and \nelectricity demand centers, the poor conditions of transmission and distribution network result in \nhigher risks of system outages, poor services and transmission losses estimated at 20% of net \npower generation. Technical losses mostly occur on the distribution system at 0.4 to 35 kilovolts, \nwhich are about three times higher than what could be expected from well-performing distribution \ncompanies.  Investment  in  transmission  and  distribution  networks  is  required  to  reduce \noverloading, improve supply reliability and significantly reduce electricity losses.  \n \n6.  With poor electricity transmission infrastructure, Uzbekistan is unable to capitalize its \nexport and transit potential. The power grid of Uzbekistan is a major component of the Central \nAsian power transmission network, and the Coordinating Dispatch Center in Tashkent manages \nnetwork operation and planning. As increased interconnection and power trades are expected \nbetween Uzbekistan and neighboring countries, the supervisory monitoring and control of energy \nflows among countries and enhanced transmission network will be prerequisite to increased \nregional energy trade. At present, Uzbekistan is the only country in the Central Asian power \nsystem that does not have supervisory control and data acquisition in the national dispatch center. \nThis results in the inefficient operation of energy assets and constrains Uzbekistan\u2019s capacity for \nregional power trade. \n \n7.  In 2017, Uzbekistan initiated comprehensive economic reforms that it included liberalizing \nits exchange rate and restructuring its state-owned enterprises to solve long-standing difficulties \nassociated with economic performance and efficiency. The liberalization of the foreign exchange \nregime and local currency devaluation created significant challenges to energy utilities, massively \ndistorting  the  value  of  assets,  capital  structures  and  revenue  generation  under  existing \ngovernance and financial management frameworks. To recover the sustainability of energy \nutilities, the government launched several initiatives and legislative acts for sector reforms that \nincludes (i) development of cost reflective energy tariffs, (ii) adoption of international financial \nreporting standards and disclosures and (iii) strengthening financial management and corporate \ngovernance frameworks.3  \n \n8.  Government development plan. The government formulated its vision, \u201cUzbekistan \nTowards 2030\u201d, with the aim to overcome social and economic challenges. The government \nrecognizes the strong link between energy and economic growth, and the urgency to sustain gas \nsupply by modernizing transmission infrastructure. The key priority is to maintain momentum on \nstructural reforms and liberalizing economic activities that would lead to more financial resources \nfor achieving long-term economic growth. Developing and implementing cost-reflective pricing for \nnatural  gas  is  essential  to  successful  energy  reforms.  In  \u201cUzbekistan  Towards  2030\u201d,  the \ngovernment is committed to promote a resource-efficient growth model through (i) institutional \nand governance reforms in the energy sector with potential unbundling of upstream, mid-stream \nand downstream functions; and (ii) rationalized and cost-reflective pricing for gas and electricity.  \n \n9.  Energy is one of ADB\u2019s priority sectors of engagement in Uzbekistan. The country \npartnership strategy indicates that energy sector operations will focus on reform and market \ndevelopment to meet energy demand with reliable, environmentally sustainable supply.4 The \n                                                \n3   Presidential Decree no. 3851, 2018, Tashkent, Uzbekistan. \n4   ADB. 2012.

The three ensuing energy projects to be prepared under the F-TRTA are of similar nature. \nThese projects are aligned with the government\u2019s objectives to strengthen reliability of the energy \nsector to increase its sustainability and efficiency and mobilize private sector investments.5 The \nprojects aim to improve the quality of energy supply, reduce aggregate technical and commercial \nlosses, and improve the financial performance of energy utilities.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: energy sector project feasibility and preparation supported. The F-TRTA \nwill provide technical expertise to prioritize, plan and prepare the following sustainable energy \ninvestment projects: (i) Regional Gas Transmission Efficiency Enhancement Project, (ii) Network \nDistribution  Modernization  Program,  and  (iii)  Regional  Energy  Transmission  and  Dispatch \nEnhancement Project. The technical assistance will include all necessary due diligence to assess \ntechnical suitability, and the economic, financial and social viability of the proposed projects. The \nF-TRTA will also address capacity and institutional issues, environmental and social safeguards, \nand  climate  adaptation  and  mitigation;  and  identify  measures  to  strengthen  project \nimplementation. Detailed activities will include, as required: (i) technical feasibility studies; (ii) \neconomic  and  financial  analysis;  (iii)  financial  management  assessments;  (iv)  procurement \nassessments, plans and preparation of bidding documents, market analysis; (v) gender analysis, \ncollection of baseline data and gender action plans; (vi) risk assessment and management plans; \n(vii) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples; \n(viii) integrity due diligence; (ix) initial poverty and social analysis; (x) climate adaptation and \nmitigation measures and climate risk and vulnerability assessment; (xi) sector assessment; (xii) \nproject  implementation  consultant  recruitment;  and  (xiii)  assisting  resettlement  plan \nimplementation. \n \n12.  Output 2: financial management capacity building intervention and energy sector \nreforms. This will include identifying potential financial management, reporting, disclosure and \ncorporate  governance  issues,  and  defining  the  scope  of  capacity  building  to  meet  ADB\u2019s \nrequirements on financial sustainability and management.  \n \n13.  In addition, a strategy to mobilize and manage public-private partnerships in energy \ninfrastructure at a national level will be developed. This will include supporting the government to \nimprove  its  approach  to  identify,  design,  manage,  tender,  and  negotiate  private  sector \nparticipation in energy projects. Also, the F-TRTA will help the government assess its investment \npipeline and prioritize energy projects for mobilizing private investments via competitive bidding, \nand for some of these projects, undertake analysis to generate preliminary project profiles and \nfacilitate investment roadshows.  \n \n14.  Overall F-TRTA results and outputs will be disseminated through workshops, donor \nmeetings, public private partnership and financial management thematic groups. \n \n \n \n                                                \n5  Resolution of the President of the Republic of Uzbekistan, No. PP-3107, On measures on the improvement of the oil \nand gas industry management system\", 30 June 2017, Tashkent, Uzbekistan and PR no. 3851 (2018).  \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The F-TRTA is estimated to cost $1,750,000 of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (other sources).
