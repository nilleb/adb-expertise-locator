INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) responds to the needs of South \nAsian developing member countries (DMCs)1 for innovative technology and crosscutting solutions \nto strengthen project preparation.2 \n \n2.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2030,  which  emphasizes  strengthening  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) as a knowledge provider and expanding knowledge partnerships to \nsupport key operational priorities such as tackling climate change, making cities more livable, and \npromoting rural development and food security.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  South Asia is the fastest growing region in Asia\u2014registering an average growth of 6.7% \nin 2018\u2014beating the trend of slowdown and moderated growth in most of the developing Asian \neconomies.4 Despite impressive economic gains that is expected to continue (6.8% in 2019 and \n6.9% in 2020), the region continues to face development challenges posed by the remaining \ninfrastructure deficit, rapid pace of urbanization, and climate change. \n \n4.  In South Asia, one-third of the population lives in urban areas (31.0% in 2017), and this is \nexpected to increase significantly to 48.6% in 2050.5 This rapid pace of urbanization, while \ncreating huge economic opportunities, also presents formidable problems. Rural\u2013urban migration \nhas put pressure on already constrained infrastructure and basic services such as water supply, \nwastewater management, solid waste management, housing, and urban transport. Cities are \nbecoming  more  complex  to  manage  because  of  the  need  to  simultaneously  address \nenvironmental degradation and massive shortfalls in urban infrastructure. Infrastructure financing \ncannot keep up with the huge demand brought about by the rapidly changing demographic, \neconomic, and social development landscape. Transport infrastructure such as roads, railways, \nairways, waterways, and seaways are severely lacking or in poor conditions\u2014hampering efficient \nmovement of people, goods, and services in South Asia. Energy security is threatened with \nincreasing demands from manufacturing, businesses, and households alike. Industrialization and \nrelated economic activities require sufficient energy supply to efficiently provide goods and \nservices. The energy sector needs to keep pace to maximize potential economic gains while \naddressing climate change mitigation by promoting renewable energy and energy efficiency. \nClimate change, disasters, and natural hazards continue to threaten sustainable development in \nthe region. Low-lying settlements along the coastlines are increasingly vulnerable to natural \nhazards. Water resources also plays a critical role in disaster management and food security. \nNatural hazards such as droughts, monsoons, heat waves, and earthquakes have caused \nsignificant loss of lives and economic damage. \n \n5.  ADB has been helping South Asian DMCs address these key development issues. As of \n2018, ADB has committed $84 billion to assist South Asian DMCs in sectors such as transport, \nenergy, urban, education, and agriculture.6 However, much remains to be done to address \npersistent development problems. The region still needs substantial resources to fill infrastructure \ndeficits, especially in lagging areas. Many still have no access to safe drinking water and lack \n                                                \n1 South Asian DMCs consist of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2019.  \n3 ADB. 2018.

South Asian DMCs still experience power outages that restrain economic growth, \nwhile underdeveloped transportation networks restrict the flow of people, goods, and services. \nRehabilitation and better management and maintenance of infrastructure assets are essential. All \nof these need substantial financing though resources are limited.    \n \n6.  Innovative technology and crosscutting solutions will be a key component to address these \ndevelopment issues. Integrating innovative technology into infrastructure and public services will \nreduce life-cycle costs and increase durability, improve the efficiency and quality of services, and \nminimize negative environmental and social impacts. Examples of urban sector technologies \nneeded in South Asian DMCs include those for (i) nonrevenue water reduction; (ii) water treatment \nsystems (arsenic and fluoride treatment, compact salinity treatment, end-of-pipe treatment for \ndisinfection); (iii) digitization and monitoring technologies for distribution network; (iv) optimization \nof existing sewerage treatment plants (smart systems) with information and communication \ntechnology  and  artificial  intelligence;  (v)  sewer  cleaning  systems;  (vi)  pumping  systems \noptimization; (vii) segregation technologies in sorting plants; (viii) conversion of biodegradable \nwaste to compost; and (ix) improving efficiency of integrated system of waste cycle. Examples of \nenergy  sector  technologies  include  the  transformation  of  energy  audit  reports  into  energy \nefficiency  investments,  waste  heat  recovery  options,  and  floating  solar  power  generation. \nExamples of transport sector technologies include the intercity rapid rail transport and metro rail \nsystems. Finally, examples of agriculture sector technologies include those for water resource \nmanagement (irrigation systems, flood management, coastal management) and food standards. \n \n7.  The TA will respond to the needs of South Asian DMCs for innovative technology and \ncrosscutting solutions to pressing problems by focusing on knowledge transfer from selected \nagencies  in  the  Republic  of  Korea  (ROK),  including  Korea  Water  Resources  Corporation \n(K-water), Korea Environment and Industry Technology Institute (KEITI), Korea Energy Agency \n(KEA), Seoul Housing and Communities Corporation, Korean Rail Network Authority (KRNA), and \nSeoul Metro. Knowledge partnership arrangements (without transfer of payments) with ROK \nagencies that have expertise in providing knowledge support for high-priority development issues \nin South Asian DMCs will be explored as needed during TA implementation.7 \n \n8.  The TA focuses on agencies in the ROK because of  \n(i)  its transformation from an aid recipient to a donor by achieving unprecedented \neconomic growth within the past half century and its development experience and \nknow-how, which offer a valuable resource for DMCs in South Asia;  \n(ii)  its  level  of  technologies,  which\u2014while  among  the  world\u2019s  most  advanced\u2014\nmatches the development progression of DMCs in South Asia;  \n(iii)  its knowledge sharing program, which proactively helps developing countries \nachieve industrial growth and economic stability; and  \n                                                \n7 ADB has existing partnership agreements with several ROK agencies: (i) K-water with the Sustainable Development \nand Climate Change Department signed in May 2019 to promote water security in Asia and the Pacific; and with the \nSouth Asia Department signed in February 2016 to carry out technical study on water supply systems including \nnonrevenue water reduction; (ii) KEA with the South Asia Department signed in March 2017 under which KEA will \nprovide advisory support to ADB\u2019s energy efficiency initiatives and the energy efficiency technical support team in \nADB; (iii) KEITI with the South Asia Department signed in March 2019 and will end in March 2022, to promote \ninstitutional cooperation between the two agencies in the areas of environment policies and programs, climate change, \nwater resource management, waste management, and reduction, control, and monitoring of air pollution, among \nothers; and (iv) KEA with ADB signed in June 2019 and will end in May 2022, to renew the general framework for \ncooperation and promote information exchange and knowledge sharing, and carry out joint activities on energy \nefficiency, renewable energy, energy access, and climate change issues. \n \n ", "3 \n(iv)  its long and successful partnership and collaboration with ADB and its DMCs on \nvarious endeavors and initiatives. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: efficient infrastructure development and \nprovision of quality public service by South Asian DMCs.8 The TA will have the following outcome: \npipeline of projects with innovative technology and crosscutting solutions increased.9 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Analytical studies on innovative technologies and crosscutting solutions \non areas of priority prepared. The analytical studies, such as pre-feasibility studies based on \nwhich South Asian DMCs can explore development partner funding, will focus on selected areas \nof ADB operations such as energy, urban, transport, and agriculture sectors. Possible topics for \nstudies include solid waste management, holistic urban development, affordable housing, energy \nefficiency, and water resource management. Additional topics, which may be requested by DMCs, \nADB resident missions, or sector divisions, will be included in the course of TA implementation. \nThe studies will focus on use of cost-effective technologies based on successful experiences in \nthe ROK. These innovative technologies and crosscutting solutions will be transferred to DMCs \nthrough training workshops with the goal of enhancing skills at the policy and program level.  \n   \n11.  Output  2:  Knowledge  on  innovative  technologies  and  crosscutting  solutions \nenhanced. This  will  involve  the formulation  and  conduct  of capacity-building  programs for \ngovernment agencies and exposure visits to selected ROK agencies. The programs aim to \ndevelop technical expertise of the staff and improve institutional functions to deliver much needed \nservices of international standards for citizens. Areas of such programs include water treatment, \nwastewater management, floating solar power generation, and intercity rapid rail transport and \nmetro rail systems, to be provided by K-water and KRNA. Relevant technologies will also be \ndisseminated through events such as roadshows, to be coordinated with KEITI.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and administered by ADB. The key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will finance the TA \nactivities including operational expenses in the form of consulting services; training events, \nconferences, and workshops; and other TA related activities. The TA will not be used for payment \nto  ROK  agencies  for  their  expertise,  civil  works,  procurement  of  large-scale  equipment, \npermanent staffing costs, and hiring of staff consultants.  \n \n                                                \n8  Defined by the TA. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division, South Asia Department. ADB will engage individual consultants and \norganize workshops for the implementation of TA activities.
