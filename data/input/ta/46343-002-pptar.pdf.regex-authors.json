The proposed technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Energy Efficiency and Urban \nEnvironment Improvement Project is included in the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 for \nMongolia.  The  proposed  project  will  upgrade  the  electricity  transmission  and  distribution \nnetworks  in  and  around  Ulaanbaatar,  thereby  improving  energy  efficiency,  reducing \ntransmission and distribution losses, and reducing emission of greenhouse gases and other air \npollutants from existing power plants in Ulaanbaatar. The project will also facilitate financial \nclosure of an ongoing combined heat and power (CHP) plant\u2014plant number 5 (CHP 5)\u2014\nthrough a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) model that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \nbeen  supporting. 1  The  components  of  the  project  include  (i)  upgrading  the  electricity \ntransmission and distribution networks; (ii) computerizing the system at load dispatch center, \ntransmission, and distribution level; and (iii) capacity building. \n \n2.  ADB received a request on 23 April 2013 from the Government of Mongolia to provide \nthe TA. During the fact-finding mission on 25 November 2013, an understanding was reached \nwith  the  Ministry  of  Energy  regarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing agreements, and outline terms of reference for the TA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In Mongolia, the energy sector has been unbundled into generation, load dispatch center, \nand transmission and distribution companies since 2001. Due to lack of available public funding, \nprivate investment in the sector is a key policy priority for the government. Existing facilities for \nproviding heating and electricity (power plants and transmission and distribution lines) are \nenergy-inefficient and vulnerable because they are old and outdated. Two of three coal-based \nCHP plants in Ulaanbaatar, CHPs 2 and 3, have operated for more than 40 years without proper \nemission control devices, and the largest plant, CHP 4, has operated for more than 25 years. \nDue to inadequate heat supply and coverage of central heating systems, residents in ger areas \nsurrounding Ulaanbaatar (60% of residents in Ulaanbaatar) have to use coal-based household \nstoves and small, inefficient, heat-only boilers without proper emission control devices. Lack of \ninvestment in expanding the coverage of the electricity and heating network is the primary \ncause for continued use of inefficient and polluting heat systems. The result is serious urban air \npollution during the winter season in Ulaanbaatar, which is widely regarded as among the most \npolluted cities in the Asia and Pacific region.3 During winter months, particulate matter of less \nthan  10  micrometers  in  diameter  (PM10)  in  Ulaanbaatar\u2019s  atmosphere  routinely  measures \n279 micrograms per cubic meter of air, which is about five times higher than the World Health \nOrganization\u2019s air quality guidelines of 50 micrograms/cubic meter. \n \n4.  Mongolia  has  experienced  rapid  economic  growth  (11.5%  in  2013)  led  by  mining \ndevelopment. 4 Electricity and heating demand has also been growing in Ulaanbaatar due to \n                                                 \n1   By strengthening associated transmission and distribution networks, the project will overcome a critical barrier to \nreliable evacuation of power from the CHP 5. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 March 2014. \n3  The proposed project  will complement and coordinate its activities, as necessary,  with two ongoing urban \ndevelopment and urban transport projects administered by East Asia Urban and Social Sectors Division and East \nAsia Transport and Communications Division (ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the \nBoard of Directors: Proposed Loan to Mongolia for the Ulaanbaatar Urban Services and Ger Areas Development \nInvestment Program. Manila; ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to Mongolia for the Urban Transport Development Investment Program. Manila). \n4  The World Bank. 2013. Mongolia Economic Update. Washington, DC. \n ", "2 \nrapid urbanization and more economic and commercial activities.5 But due to the unavailability \nof new power and heat plants, this demand is largely unmet and suppressed. As a result, \nelectricity consumption in the central energy system, which covers Ulaanbaatar, other major \ncities, and mining development areas, grew modestly to 3,542 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2012, \nabout 34% more than in 2003.6 It is projected that electricity consumption in the central energy \nsystem will increase to 4,422 GWh in 2015 and by 2025 reach 8,189 GWh, more than double \nthe 2012 rate.7 The reserve margin of heat and power supply has become close to zero. To \novercome  the  potential  supply  shortage,  the  government  plans  to  build  a  new  CHP 5  in \nUlaanbaatar through a PPP model, and install additional capacity in the existing CHP 4. \n \n5.   The  Government  of  Japan  is  supporting  capacity  expansion  at  the  CHP 4  by \n100 megawatts of electricity. ADB has been supporting construction of a new, energy-efficient \nCHP 5 (3 x 150 megawatts of electricity, using the circulating fluidized-bed boiler technique) \nthrough preparation of a feasibility study with safeguard documents and with advisory services \nto  the  government  on  PPP  transactions.  The  international  tender  for  the  CHP 5  was \nsuccessfully conducted and the government announced a preferred bidder on 26 August 2013.8 \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is taking a lead role among the financiers, which \ninclude the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Japan Bank for International \nCooperation, and private commercial banks. If the financial closure of the deal is successful, this \nwill be the largest PPP transaction in the power sector of Mongolia. \n \n6.  In parallel to the construction of the new CHP 5 and the capacity expansion at the \nCHP 4, associated downstream facilities\u2014e.g., power transmission and distribution networks \nmanaged by the Central Regional Electricity Transmission Company (CRETC) and Ulaanbaatar \nElectricity Distribution Network Company (UBEDC), and district heating networks managed by \nUlaanbaatar District Heating Company\u2014have to be strengthened and expanded to be able to \nsupply reliable electricity and heat not only to existing customers but also to as-yet unserved \ncommunities and entities in Ulaanbaatar.9 This will ensure that new investments in CHP plants \nwill be optimally utilized. The existing power transmission and distribution infrastructure is \ninefficient and unreliable for lack of investment and maintenance, and is in urgent need of \nrehabilitation and upgrade. Electricity distribution losses totaled 19.6% in 2012, much higher \nthan international best practice of about 5%. The average outage duration of the distribution \nnetwork in Ulaanbaatar was 2,084.5 minutes per customer with more than 13 interruptions per \ncustomer in 2012, unacceptably high for any modern electricity distribution network. Improving \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  will  reduce  the  power  losses  and  thereby  avoid \nadditional consumption of coal and associated greenhouse gas emissions and pollutants; and \nimprove the reliability and quality of electricity services to a population of 1.2 million, or 40% of \nthe total population of Mongolia.  \n \n                                                 \n5   The population of Ulaanbaatar grew by 32.5% during 2003\u20132011 (1.2 million in 2011) and is expected to grow by \nabout 26.9% during 2012\u20132020.  \n6    Major mining activities are supported through captive power plants, which are not part of the central grid.   \n7   ADB. 2010.

Manila. \n8  The consortium of International Power\u2013GDF Suez (France), Newcom (Mongolia), Posco Energy (the Republic of \nKorea), and Sojitz Corp (Japan). \n9  The lengths of electricity distribution lines are (i) 895.7 kilometers (km) of overhead 35 kilovolt (kV); (ii) 1,417.1 km \nof overhead 6 kV\u201310 kV; (iii) 754.7 km of underground cable; (iv) 1,716 km of overhead 0.4 kV; and (v) 492.1 km of \nunderground cable 0.4 kV. The number of substations are (i) 40 of 35/6\u201310 kV; (ii) 6 of 35/0.4 kV; and (iii) 1,414 of \n6\u201310/0.4 kV. The installed capacity of 6 kV\u201310 kV substations is 609.3 megavolt-ampere. Electricity demand from \nthe Ulaanbaatar distribution network in 2011 was 1,849 terawatt-hours (TWh) and total sales were 1,472 TWh. The \nlength of the electricity transmission lines in Ulaanbaatar is about 142 km of 220 kV and140 km of 110 kV. \n ", "  3\n7.  In addition to the above investments, there is an urgent need to strengthen the capacity \nof the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC), which is mandated to issue operational licenses \nto power plants, review and approve tariffs of licensees, and propose the end-user tariffs to the \ngovernment. Since no new plants have been set up for a long time in Mongolia (para. 4), the \nERC does not have hands-on experience in setting electricity and heating tariffs that would \nallow an adequate return on new investments and promote energy-efficient practices in the \nsector. This is a critical capacity gap that may undermine investments in new plants. With the \nlarge proposed investments in two CHP plants (para. 4), this need has become more urgent. \n \n8.  Through  close  donor  coordination,  the  government  requested  ADB  and  the  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency to focus on electricity transmission and distribution, whereas \nthe World Bank was requested to focus on the district heating network. The proposed project is \nin line with (i) the country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 (and the new government confirmed \nits continued priority during the review of the strategy in November 2013); (ii) Mongolia\u2019s energy \nsector master plan; and (iii) ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, 2009.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  (i)  identify  issues  in  electricity  transmission  and  distribution  networks; \n(ii) prepare feasibility studies based on these issues;10 (iii) improve the capacity of implementing \nagencies to understand and apply ADB\u2019s procurement and disbursement procedures, and meet \nits environmental and social safeguard requirements; and (iv) develop the capacity of other \npublic entities in the energy sector that are involved in the project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved energy services in Mongolia. The outcome will be improved \nefficiency of the power transmission and distribution systems in Ulaanbaatar.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA outputs will be to rehabilitate and expand power transmission and distribution \nsystems, and develop the institutional capacity of the ERC.  \n \n12.  The TA will conduct due diligence for the proposed project, covering various aspects: \n(i)  Technical. Due diligence on technology selection will determine if the selected \ntechnology is appropriate for improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions.  \n(ii)  Economic  and  financial.  Economic  and  financial  analyses  of  the  project  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s financial management analysis11 and economic analysis12 \nguidelines will determine the economic and financial viability of the project. The \nTA  will  also  assess  financial  management,  design  of  funds  flow,  and \ndisbursement arrangements.  \n                                                 \n10  Contents of the feasibility study should include (i) project overview, (ii) analysis of system status, (iii) project \nrationale, (iv) technical design, (v) implementation schedule, (vi) energy saving analysis, (vii) cost estimates and \nfinancing plan, (viii) financial and economic analysis, (ix) social analysis, and (x) environmental impact assessment. \n11 The analysis will be guided by ADB\u2019s (i) Financial Management and Analysis of Projects (ADB. 2005. Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects. Manila.), (ii) Financial Due Diligence Methodology Note (ADB. 2009 \nFinancial  Due  Diligence  Methodology  Note.  Manila.),  (iii)  Financial  Management  Assessment  Questionnaire \n(http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/financial-management-assessment-questionnaire.pdf),  and  (iv)  latest  ADB \ntechnical guidance for preparation and presentation of cost estimates. \n12 The analysis will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). \n ", "4 \n(iii)  Environment. The TA will estimate to what extent a reduction of system losses \nwill reduce emission of carbon dioxide and pollutants. \n(iv)  Governance. The TA will assess the sector-specific policy, legal, and institutional \nmechanisms and anticorruption measures, and assess the procurement capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies (CRETC and UBEDC).  \n(v)  Procurement. An indicative procurement plan, including details of procurement \npackages and their procurement mode, will be prepared. Due diligence will be \nconducted  on  new  procurement  laws,  and  the  requirements  of  the  general \nprocurement  agency  for  ADB-financed  projects.  Actions  required  to  facilitate \nadvanced  contracting  will  be  comprehensively  examined  during  TA \nimplementation to ensure that the project\u2019s readiness can be enhanced.   \n(vi)  Sector  policy.  Due  diligence  will  examine  tariffs,  and  billing  and  collection \npolicies.  \n(vii)  Social  dimension.  A  social  and  poverty  analysis  will  be  conducted  for  the \npreparation of the summary poverty reduction and social strategy, with focus on \nconducting analyses on gender, health impact, affordability, and potential job \ncreation.  \n(viii)  Safeguards. The environmental impact assessment report will be prepared by a \nlocally certified agency and approved by both the Ministry of Environment and \nGreen  Development  and  ADB.  The  report  shall  be  prepared  to  meet  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). If necessary, a resettlement plan will be \nprepared in accordance with the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n13.  Based on the lessons learned from previous interventions in similar projects, the main \nrisk in attaining the project\u2019s output is a delay in project implementation. To mitigate that risk, the \nTA will provide project implementation training to the implementing agency, supported by ADB\u2019s \nresident mission in Ulaanbaatar. Training will include procurement procedures, disbursement \nprocedures, and environmental and social safeguard requirements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \nfurniture,  administrative  support  services,  and  local  city  transport  and  logistics  costs.  The \ngovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Energy will be the executing agency, and CRETC and UBEDC will be the \nimplementing agencies. A project steering committee will be established under the Ministry of \nEnergy to oversee overall project implementation and coordinate with relevant government \nagencies  and  ADB.13 A  project  management  office  will  be  established  under  CRETC  and \nUBEDC to implement the project. \n \n16.  The TA will take a two-stage approach to use consulting services efficiently. Part 1 (data \ngathering and preliminary assessment) will require individual consultants (two international, \n                                                 \n13 The committee will comprise representatives from the Ministry of Energy, Ulaanbaatar Municipal Government, and \nthe Ministry of Environment.  \n ", "  5\n4 person-months; and two national, 4 person-months) while part 2 (preparation of feasibility \nstudies, capacity building, and due diligence) will require a consulting firm (eight international \nconsultants, 34 person-months; and 10 national consultants, 103 person-months). The required \nareas of expertise and the outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The \nconsulting firm will be engaged using the quality- and cost-based selection method (with a \nquality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10)14 and a simplified technical proposal. The consultants for parts 1 and \n2 will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The procurement of equipment under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA will be \ndisbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). Equipment procured under the TA will be turned over to the executing \nagency upon TA completion.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months. Part 1 is expected to start on 1 June 2014 \nand end on 31 July 2014, while part 2 is expected to start on 1 August 2014 and end on 31 May \n2016. \n \n18.
