INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance will support evaluations of ADB and its operations in the \nAsia and Pacific region. Independent evaluation is essential for good corporate governance and \nthe results focus of multilateral development banks. This technical assistance (TA) for the \nIndependent  Evaluation  department  (IED)  will  support  evaluations  to  help  improve  the \neffectiveness of Asian Development Bank (ADB) policies, business processes, and operations in \nthe Asia and Pacific region.1  \n \n2.  The TA is anchored in the Board-approved evaluation work program. Evaluations \nsupported by the cluster knowledge and support technical assistance (C-KSTA) will be conducted \nover the 2020\u22122024 period, in line with IED\u2019s annual 3\u2212year rolling work programs.2 The current \nwork program covering the 2020\u20132022 period was endorsed by the Development Effectiveness \nCommittee (DEC) and approved by the Board of Directors on 12 December 2019.3 In carrying out \nits function, IED follows internationally accepted principles and standards. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  With significant development progress have come complex challenges. The region \nhas reduced poverty and advanced development across many dimensions. At the same time, \nincome and non-income disparities, environmental degradation, climate change, health risks, and \nfragility persist or have worsened. The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is \nalready affecting the region\u2019s ability to achieve inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development.  \n \n4.  These challenges demand a more ambitious global agenda. Intensifying and more \ncomplex challenges have brought about a more ambitious and aspirational global development \nagenda. The Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, and other recently adopted \nglobal and regional agendas collectively embody a new deal for global development that aims to \ntackle the most pressing problems while seizing the most important opportunities. \n \n5.  Achieving this agenda will require stronger development effectiveness. Realizing \ninclusive, resilient, and sustainable development in the face of mounting challenges, in particular, \nthe COVID-19 pandemic will require not only greater but also more effective use of development \nresources. This in turn requires that development assistance processes be strengthened. This \ncarries important implications for development institutions like ADB. \n \n6.  A stronger, better, and faster ADB requires continual learning and improvement. \nADB\u2019s new Strategy 20304 and stronger financial base, owing to the combination of the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF) and ordinary capital resources, will support its higher qualitative and \nquantitative ambitions, but becoming a stronger, better, and faster institution will also require \ncontinual reflection and improvement. In addition to its core business of financing projects, ADB \nwill need to strengthen its ability to derive and deploy knowledge and leverage partnerships. \nIndependent evaluation makes an important contribution to this ongoing process. \n \n1 The concept paper for this C-KSTA was approved by director general, IED on 13 May 2020.   \n2  The C-KSTA cluster first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 May 2020. The C-\nKSTA is divided into three subprojects. Subproject 1 will support the delivery of evaluations to be mobilized in 2020 \nand completed through 2022, as set out in the current IED work program. Subproject 2 is structured along the same \nlines and will support the delivery of evaluations in 2022\u22122023, based on the next 3-year work program.  Subproject \n3 will support the delivery of evaluations in 2023\u22122024, based on the work program cycle for that period. \n3  https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/page/110939/WP-2020-2022.pdf \n4  https://www.adb.org/documents/strategy-2030-prosperous-inclusive-resilient-sustainable-asia-pacific \n ", "2 \n \n7.  Independent evaluation supports development effectiveness in the region. Through \nevaluation, IED aims to help ADB and member countries achieve better development results. In \nline with Strategy 2030, evaluation intends to shed light on the critical challenges facing the region \n(Supplementary Appendix 1). As ADB operations expand under Strategy 2030, the role of its \nindependent evaluation function must also expand, in the interest of accountability and learning. \n \n8.  IED plans a real-time evaluation of ADB\u2019s response to COVID-19. The evaluation will \nstart in 2020 and be completed in mid-2021 and will examine ADB\u2019s response to the pandemic \nand its support for member countries. As the crisis evolves and significant resources are mobilized \nin response, it is critical that early lessons are documented. In addition, IED will: develop new \ndesk and online-based approaches, processes, and products; issue short evaluation knowledge \nnotes on issues directly relevant to the COVID-19 crisis; and provide real-time comments and \ninput to ADB as it prepares programs to help countries respond to the crisis.  \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n9.  A cluster TA modality is the most appropriate way of funding IED\u2019s 3-year rolling \nwork programs. These are strategically linked with a common overall objective. For example, \nthe 2020\u22122022 work program aligns with ADB\u2019s corporate strategies and the operational priorities \nof Strategy 2030. The cluster modality enables funding to be flexibly designed and implemented. \nIt allows better sequencing of TA activities compared with stand-alone TA projects that are \nprocessed annually and that do not fit well with the rolling work program. \n \n10.  The TA builds on earlier lessons and experience to improve efficiency. Until 2016, \nIED processed TA projects on a yearly basis, which complicated planning and delivery processes. \nYearly TA preparation and approvals required an inordinate amount of administrative work, with \napprovals required from both Management and the Board and frequent scope changes to keep \nthe TA updated. The shift to a cluster modality streamlined the process for IED, Management, \nand the Board, while adding flexibility. Another lesson is the importance of knowledge sharing, \ncapacity development, and outreach to increase the learning from and use of evaluations.  \n \n11.  The TA will support a strategic mix of evaluations over the medium term. IED draws \non both its annual administrative budget and TA resources to deliver its work programs. By \ncombining these resources, IED can plan and deliver timely, relevant, and high-quality evaluations \nand knowledge activities. This proposed C-KSTA for 2020\u20132024 follows an earlier cluster TA \napproved in 2016.5 Like the first cluster TA, the proposed C-KSTA will support the delivery of a \n \n5 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance Report: Selected Evaluation Studies and Outreach for 2017-2019. Manila. The third \nand final subproject was approved in December 2018 and will be completed in 2021. To date, the committed amount \nfor the 2016 Cluster TA is 85%, with 81% of contracts disbursed, and overall 68% of total TA resources disbursed. \nTwo earlier stand-alone TA projects were approved in 2014 (TA 8653) and 2015 (TA 8928) to support mid- and high-\nlevel evaluation studies and outreach activities, of which IED has disbursed 78% and 90% of TA funds, respectively. \nIED will spend down the remaining TA resources in 2020, with the intention of closing the two TA projects in early \n2021. The two stand-alone TAs are: ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance Report: Selected Evaluation Studies for 2014. \nManila; ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance Report: Selected Evaluation Studies for 2015. Manila. Evaluations in 2020 \nand 2021, the transition period between the two cluster TAs, may draw on both the earlier C-KSTA or stand-alone \nTAs as well as the new C-KSTA. Evaluations that draw on more than one TA will be clearly identified in each TA \ncompletion report as having been partially funded by that TA. \n \n \n ", "3 \nmix of evaluations and validations, including some complementary knowledge and outreach \nactivities.6 \n \n12.  Prior evaluations have made important contributions to ADB policies, strategies, \nand operations. Examples of the wide range of evaluations that have been supported by earlier \nTA resources are listed in Table 1. These evaluations have helped to strengthen ADB\u2019s policies, \nstrategies, and programs across a range of sectors and thematic areas, modalities and facilities, \nand country programs. As reported in IED\u2019s 2020 Annual Evaluation Review, about 77% of IED \nevaluation  recommendations  are  accepted  by  ADB  Management,  and  of  these  70%  are \nimplemented.7 IED will try to incrementally raise these levels in the forthcoming C-KSTA period. \n \nTable 1: Examples of Evaluations Supported by Prior Technical Assistance \nCorporate, Sector-wide and Thematic Evaluations   Evaluations of Modalities and Facilities \nADB Support for the Transport Sector (2020)  Multitranche Financing Facility (2019) \nEffectiveness of Safeguard Policy Statement (2020)  Policy-Based Lending (2018) \nADB Energy Policy and Program (2020)  Private Sector Equity Investments (2019) \nAsian Development Fund Operations (2019)  Credit Enhancement Products (2018) \nADB Support for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (2018)  Results-Based Lending (2017) \nADB Support for Gender and Development (2017) \nCountry Program Evaluationsa  Technical Assistance Evaluations \nIndonesia (2019)  Strengthening Safeguard Capacity in the Pacific (2019) \nAzerbaijan (2018)  Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation \nIndia (2017)  Corridors Initiative Greater Mekong Subregion (2019) \nSri Lanka (2016)  Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (2018) \n a Excludes validations of country partnership strategy final review reports.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank (Independent Evaluation Department). \n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the impact of improved development effectiveness of ADB \noperations, policies, and business processes.8 The TA will have the outcome of increased \nuse of and learning from evaluations and their recommendations by the DEC, ADB Management \nand staff, and broader stakeholders (Appendix 1). The implicit theory of change holds that under \nthe 2020\u20132022 work program, IED will deliver a combination of evaluations that are strategically \nand operationally relevant to Strategy 2030. These evaluations, combined with knowledge and \nlearning support, will in turn support more effective ADB policies, processes, and operations. \n \n14.  The delivery of timely and high-quality evaluation outputs will support the outcome. \nIED plans to deliver a strategic mix of relevant, timely, and evidence-based evaluations using \nappropriate methods and technologies (outputs 1\u20134).9 These outputs are described below. \nDescriptions of the major evaluations for 2020\u20132022 are in Supplementary Appendix 2. \n \n \n6 IED uses TA resources primarily to support higher-level evaluations, while its administrative budget primarily supports \nlower-level evaluations and validations and other evaluation related operations. The staff consultant budget was $2.3 \nmillion in both 2018 and 2019 and $2.4 million in 2020.   \n7 IED. 2020. Annual Evaluation Review 2020.

Policy Paper: Review of \nthe Independence and Effectiveness of the Operations Evaluation Department. Manila. \n9 Subprojects 1, 2 and 3 of the C-KSTA will have the same outputs.  \n ", "4 \n15.  Output 1: corporate and thematic evaluations delivered. IED will deliver a strategic \nmix of high-quality corporate and thematic evaluations with direct relevance to Strategy 2030. \nRecent evaluations have covered topics including small and medium-sized enterprises, gender \nand development, safeguards, and the ADF (Table 1). Planned evaluations include climate \nchange,  COVID-19,  finance  and  public  financial  management  sectors,  ADB\u2019s  procurement \nsystem, and credit and risk management (refer to Supplementary Appendix 3). \n \n16.  Output 2: country and subregional evaluations and validations delivered. IED has \ncompleted  many  country-level  evaluations  and  validations  in  recent  years  and  a  country \nevaluation on Bangladesh and validations of several country partnership strategy (CPS) final \nreviews are ongoing. IED plans to undertake subregional evaluations of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation programs. It also plans to \nconduct validations of CPS final reviews for a wide range of countries (the number depends on \nADB\u2019s CPS cycle). At least one country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) is planned for \neach year. These outputs will feed into ADB\u2019s CPS planning and Board approval cycles.  \n \n17.  Output 3: sector evaluations delivered. The re-introduction of evaluations covering \nADB\u2019s assistance in specific sectors across countries has been appreciated by the Board and \nADB  Management.  IED  plans  to  undertake  sector-level  evaluations,  in  the  form  of  sector \nassistance program evaluations (SAPEs), sector-wide evaluations, and sector synthesis notes, in \nline with the thematic perspective of Strategy 2030. SAPE and sector-wide evaluations have \nrecently covered agriculture, energy, transport, finance in Indonesia, and energy in Pakistan. \nPlanned evaluations will cover finance and water and urban services. Sector synthesis notes will \ncover environment and social safeguards in both sovereign and nonsovereign operations. \n \n18.  Output 4: complementary and quick turn-around evaluation work delivered. IED \nplans to undertake a systematic review and a topical paper annually over the next 3 years. These \ncomplementary outputs will focus on policy-based lending by multilateral development banks, \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment, energy, and possibly climate change or finance. IED will \nremain ready to respond to requests for quick turn-around and other complementary evaluations, \nand to disseminate knowledge from its products at forums or publications.  \n \n19.  IED will provide complementary EKM support and improve its information systems. \nIED will complement the delivery of evaluations with EKM activities, consisting of knowledge \nsharing, capacity development, outreach, and communication, targeting different internal and \nexternal audiences.10 This will raise the visibility and use of evaluation evidence among IED\u2019s key \nstakeholders: the ADB Board and DEC, ADB Management and staff, and country agencies and \nstakeholders. IED will improve and modernize its information systems for its core evaluation work \nand manage and disseminate evaluation  knowledge.11 These include the IED subsite, the \nManagement Action Record System (MARS), the Evaluation Information System (the lessons \ndatabase and management dashboard), the Cognitive Search initiative for evaluation lessons \n(EVA) and other high-level analytical products. \n \n20.  Several risks have been identified in implementing the TA. These include unexpected \nshifts in strategic or policy directions by ADB and/or its member countries, lack of or poor quality \n \n10 Seminars,  workshops,  and  conferences  aim  to  gather  information  for  draft  report  and  support  high\u2212level \nconsultations. On a case-by case basis, the C-KSTA may also fund outreach activities, as specified in the Evaluation \nKnowledge Management team\u2019s work plan and in dissemination plans at the inception stage of an evaluation. \n11 The C-KSTA will support consultant services for key system development and enhancements, where needed. This \nwill complement the administrative budget support, continuing maintenance, and ad hoc technical support. C-KSTA \nsupport is estimated at around $30,000 annually \n ", "5 \nof data, delays to or disruption of country missions, difficulty in recruiting consultants, and the \nneed to adapt to unforeseen crises such as COVID-19. IED will monitor and manage these risks \nto ensure they do not jeopardize the efficient and effective delivery of its work program. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $6.5 million. This will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u22126)  and  TASF\u2212other  sources. 12  Detailed  cost \nestimates  and  financing  arrangements  will  be  presented  for  each  TA  subproject  proposal \nsubmitted for approval. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  IED will modify its work plans in line with the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Given \nthat country missions have been curtailed during most or all of 2020, the work plan will be adapted \nto prioritize evaluations that are less dependent on travel. Some re-arrangement in the timing of \nevaluations will be unavoidable. IED is assessing the changes needed for evaluations due in 2020 \nand early 2021 on a case-by-case basis. IED will continue to engage and consult with relevant \nADB departments, including resident missions, in all evaluations. \n \n23.  ADB is the executing agency while IED will implement the TA. Each TA subproject \nproposal will be submitted for approval to director general, IED or his/her delegated authority, in \naccordance with the business process for knowledge and support TA cluster processing.13 IED \ndivisions will implement the TA and supervise planned studies and/or knowledge and outreach \nactivities. TA subproject activities will start only after approval. IED will coordinate with relevant \nregional departments, resident missions, and government agencies during implementation of \nevaluations and obtain no-objection approval from governments before fielding missions.14 \n \n24.  Subprojects:  the  TA  will  be  implemented  through  three  subprojects.  Program \nimplementation will be flexible to accommodate alterations in IED\u2019s work plan.15 Each subproject \nwill be designed to support the achievement of the cluster outputs 1-4 as and when needed during \nthe implementation period.16 These are shown in Table 2 and described in Appendix 2. \n \n \n \n \n \n12 The C-KSTA projects will cover a mix of Group A, B and C countries. Both funding sources are available for all three \nsubprojects. Evaluations covering a single Group C country will be funded from TASF\u2212other sources. The breakdown \nfor the $2.25 million for subproject is: TASF-6 $1.75 million, and TASF-other $ 0.50 million. TASF allocations for \nsubprojects 2 and 3 will be financed by the TASF\u2019s annual resource allocation to IED in the subsequent years, and \nthe sources of financing (TASF-6 verses TASF-other) will be confirmed at that time. \n13 See the staff instruction on business processes for knowledge and support TA \n14 To ensure completeness and factual accuracy, key informant interviews will be held within and outside ADB.  The \nIED Quality Assurance Handbook requires consultations with relevant ADB departments and field offices at all \nphases of report preparation: inception; report preparation, and completion. IED receives ADB-wide feedback during \nthe interdepartmental review of its draft approach paper and evaluation report. As appropriate, IED peer reviewers \ninclude subject experts from within ADB. Before finalizing a draft paper, IED discusses the post-interdepartmental \nreview draft at a meeting of a heads of departments and offices and at a technical meeting on the evaluation \nrecommendations.  \n15 IED will consult with the DEC on changes in the approved work program, where appropriate. \n16 Detailed implementation arrangements, including consultants\u2019 terms of reference, will be presented in each \nsubproject report processed under the cluster. \n ", "6 \n \nTable 2: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nItem  Subproject Title  Period  Budget \nSubproject 1  Supporting Evaluations for Development Effectiveness  November 2020\u2013  $2,250,000 \nin Asia and the Pacific, 2020\u20132022 (approval in 2020)  December 2022 \nSubproject 2  Supporting Evaluations for Development Effectiveness  January 2022\u2013  $2,150,000 \nin Asia and the Pacific, 2021\u20132023 (approval in 2021)  December 2023 \nSubproject 3  Supporting Evaluations for Development Effectiveness  January 2023\u2013 $2,100,000 \nin Asia and the Pacific, 2022\u20132024 (approval in 2022)  December 2024 \nSource: Asian Development Bank (Independent Evaluation Department). \n \n25.

The purchase of evaluation tools, supplies and services will be for core evaluation \nand dissemination work such as conducting seminars, and/or workshops and surveys.19 \nThese will include programming and database tools, analytical instruments, and services as \ninputs during report preparation and supplies and services for seminars, workshops, and surveys. \nProcurement  will  be  on  a  case-by-case  basis  and  vetted  by  IED  management.20 IED  will \ncoordinate with the Controller\u2019s Department; Office of Administrative Services; Office of the \nGeneral Counsel; Office of Information Systems and Technology; and the Procurement, Portfolio \nand Financial Management Department, where needed. \n \n28.  During  implementation,  evaluations  will  be  complemented  by  investments  in \ninformation services and knowledge sharing. As indicated (paragraph 19), IED will engage \nwith targeted stakeholders through various avenues and learning events and will continually \ninvest in its information systems. Dissemination of outputs will be in accordance with IED\u2019s \nevaluation policy, particularly on public disclosure, dissemination, and lessons. In order to make \nevaluation knowledge more accessible, valued and used by various audiences, IED\u2019s first EKM \nstrategic plan conveys the learning side of evaluation and gives directions and a framework for \nEKM activities (outreach, communication, capacity development) in implementing approaches, \ndeveloping new products, and organizing events to reach out to target audiences.  \n \n29.  Areas for due diligence will be identified at the inception stage of an evaluation \nactivity. Areas that may need to be confirmed, assessed, and discussed include knowledge \npartnerships (outreach events, networking); transfer of funds (outreach, information systems); \nprocurement (outreach, events); printing publications (outreach); and social media and websites \n(outreach, information systems). Details will be decided prior to approval of the evaluation \napproach paper (EAP) and concept paper. Implementation will follow ADB\u2019s process and due \ndiligence procedures.21  \n \n30.  On  a  case-by-case  basis,  funds  will  be  transferred.  Knowledge  partnership \narrangements may be supported under the TA subprojects.

Consultant recruitment (firm \nor individual) will begin when either a draft evaluation approach paper (EAP), concept paper, or \nconsultant recruitment note is approved by director general, IED for interdepartmental review. \nEach evaluation will use internal commenters and external peer reviewers. Where appropriate, \ndraft reports will be sent to the government and other stakeholders for feedback. All major \nevaluations will be circulated to the Board and Management and normally discussed by the DEC.  \n \n5.  The TA will fund consulting requirements initially estimated at 181 consultants (for \n583 person-months) from 2020 to 2024.5 This consists of 75 international consultants (for 189 \nperson-months), 106 national consultants (for 394 person-months), and 28 international resource \npersons, from 2020 to 2024. \n \n6.

International, in-country, and national consultants will be engaged as and when \nneeded. Sector and theme specialists with relevant academic, professional and work experience, \nand evaluation expertise will be mainly engaged on individual assignments. Taking account of the \nscope  of  work  (e.g.,  a  stakeholder  survey,  focus  group  discussions,  and/or  key  informant \ninterviews) and inputs involved, use of a consulting firm may be considered during preparation of \nthe approach paper.  \n \n8.  For the evaluation of nonsovereign operations, private sector consultants will (i) review \nADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  strategies,  instruments,  portfolio  trends,  organization,  and \nprocesses;  (ii)  assess  individual  private  sector  operations  transactions  through  document \nreviews, field visits, and interviews with project sponsors, financiers, and relevant ADB staff;  \n(iii) compare ADB\u2019s operations with those of comparable multilateral financial institutions; and (iv) \nbased on findings (i)\u2013(iii), advise what changes are necessary to enhance ADB\u2019s value addition.  \n \n9.  For  topical  working  papers,  consultants  with  a  high  level  of  expertise  and  strong \nmultilateral experience will help prepare short papers with a strong evaluative angle, connecting \npast lessons to current and prospective situations. They will draw lessons from evaluations (from \nADB and other development partners) on topics of high operational relevance.  \n \n10.  Resource persons and reviewers will be required to (i) comment on the draft report, \nfocusing on areas that need strengthening; and (ii) give guidance on articulating key findings, \nlessons, and recommendations.7 Each evaluation will have about two peer reviewers for about 5 \nworking days per assignment. \n \n11.  The need for local consultants will be assessed at the EAP stage.8 Like international \nconsultants, the number, mix, type, expertise, work experience, inputs and duration of assignment \nwill vary depending on the topic and complexity of the study.  \n \n12.  In-country consultants will (i) prepare country reports, initially focusing on relevant ADB \nimplementation  experience,  and  current  practice  in  the  country  and  of  other  development \npartners; (ii) support evaluation mission field work, in particular facilitating logistics; (iii) arrange \nand conduct structured interviews with key informants; and (iv) support survey or questionnaire \nand data analysis. They are expected to have a sound understanding of development issues at \nthe country level, ADB policies and operations, and development partners. \n \n13.  Headquarters-based consultants will include Philippine national consultants (research \nanalysts, statisticians, and/or econometricians) who will support data collection and analytical \nwork. These range from (i) literature reviews, policy and program analysis, (ii) review of project \nand other documents; (iii) portfolio analyses, benchmarking analyses, and preparation of country \ncase studies; (iv) secondary data collection; (v) managing survey, questionnaire, and related data \nanalyses; and (vi) other statistical support and/or econometric analyses. \n \n \n7  For resource persons, passports will be used to verify an expert\u2019s nationality or member country eligibility. United \nNations documents such as laissez-passers are not acceptable. \n8 National consultants may take a regional task to assist international experts if the task does not account for a \nsubstantial part of their terms of reference. If the TA envisages international travel by a national expert, these \nrequirements must be added to their terms of reference. \n ", "  Appendix 2  15 \n14.  For nonsovereign operations, private sector experts will be engaged to (i) provide advice \non  the  national  environment,  and  national  project  finance  and  financial  market  conditions; \n(ii) arrange and conduct structured interviews with key informants; and (iii) facilitate logistical \narrangements. \n \n15.  IED will independently evaluate or validate ADB\u2019s country program operations. \nDepending on country requirements, sector and/or thematic assessments are undertaken to \nprovide inputs to the main country assistance program evaluation (CAPE). It also validates the \nfindings and assess the quality of country partnership strategy final reviews. 9  The nature or scope \nof work of each product is described below.  \n \n16.  The preparation of CAPEs and validations of CPS final reviews will require at least 27 \nconsultant evaluators (2.5 person-months each based on complexity). Specific tasks will include, \namong others, (i) review ADB assistance programs and assess their relevance, effectiveness, \nefficiency, sustainability, and impacts on strategic sector objectives; (ii) carry out key informant \ninterviews, conduct surveys on the outcome and impact of ADB assistance, and discuss sector \ndevelopment issues and concerns with executing agencies and other stakeholders; and (iii) help \nassess the validity of ADB\u2019s sector development strategies in the country. In addition, at least 12 \nresource persons (3 person-months) or an advisor and/or external reviewer will (i) comment on \nthe draft report, focusing on areas that need strengthening; and (ii) give guidance on articulating \nkey findings, lessons, and recommendations.10 \n \n17.  In-country evaluation consultants with previous exposure to development issues (sector \nand thematic) in the country will be recruited to (i) present an overview of the relevance and \nimplementation of ADB sector strategies; (ii) assess and rate the achievement of project and \nprogram objectives, and the delivery of core sector, cross-cutting, and thematic programs; (iii) \ncomment on ADB\u2019s institutional positioning and performance in a sector; (iv) organize and \nfacilitate  focus  group  discussions,  workshops,  and  meetings;  and  \n(v) define important issues and lessons in a sector\u2019s operations. \n \n18.  Headquarters-based  national  consultants  will  consist  of  evaluation  researchers  and \ncoordinators. They will provide analytical support during data collection and analyses. These will \ninclude (i) desk reviews of project and other relevant documents, internet searches and other \nliterature reviews; (ii) statistical and other technical support such as portfolio reviews, policy and \nprogram  analyses,  benchmarking,  and  statistical  and/or  econometric  analyses;  and  (iii) \npreparation of country case studies. The evaluation researchers and coordinators will (i) carry out \nquality assurance reviews on validated project and/or program completion reports and extended \nannual review reports, and/or (ii) help the project or program review report focal or group leader \nsupervise and administer the validation process. \n \n19.  To complement IED\u2019s core evaluation work, the TA will also fund quick turn-around \nevaluation work, management of information systems, and networking. Specific consultant \nservices  for  quick  turnaround  thematic  and  sector  assessments  will  relate  to  knowledge \ndissemination  of  completed  evaluations  (i.e.,  advisory  and  expert  services  for  evaluative \nresearch) and management of information systems and technology. \n \n \n9 If IED\u2019s work program does not include a CAPE for a country that is due for a new CPS, IED will validate a CPS final \nreview (CPSFRV). The CPSFRV report then serves as the CAPE equivalent for the purpose of CPS preparation. \n10 For resource persons, passports will be used to verify an expert\u2019s nationality or member country eligibility. United \nNations documents such as laissez-passers are not acceptable. \n ", "16  Appendix 2 \n20.  The C-KSTA may also support knowledge sharing and outreach events of selected \nevaluations. Consultants may be resource persons, panelists, or event coordinators. The nature \nand amount of consultant services will be determined during preparation of the approach paper \nof an evaluation or the concept paper of the outreach activity. \n \n21.  On a case-by-case basis, the C-KSTA will also support networking activities. For example, \nit may support IED cooperation with a range of development partners (with operations in Asia and \nthe Pacific) including bilateral, multilateral, and regional organizations and institutions. At the \ncountry level, it will support collaboration with universities, civil society, evaluation associations, \nand government. \n \n22.  Subproject 1 for $2.25 million will be financed by the Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF\u22126) and TASF\u2212other sources. The breakdown for subproject 1 is: TASF-6 $1.75 \nmillion, and TASF-other $ 0.50 million. Subproject 2 will be for $2.15 million and Subproject 3 for \n$2.10 million. Both will be financed by the TASF\u2019s annual resource allocation to IED in the \nsubsequent years.  \n \nTable A2.2.
