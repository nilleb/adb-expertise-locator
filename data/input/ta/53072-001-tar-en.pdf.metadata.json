INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI) provides advisory and capacity-\nbuilding  assistance  to  help  Pacific  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) improve their business enabling environments.1 This in turn supports \ninclusive,  private  sector-led  economic  growth.  The  three  consecutive  phases  of  PSDI \nimplemented since 2007 have helped Pacific DMCs carry out reforms and introduce new policies \nto improve conditions for private sector development and investment, responding to related needs \nand opportunities as they evolved.2 PSDI has expended $60.83 million during the first three \nphases which funded more than 600 subprojects. This included grant cofinancing of $54.73 million \nfrom Australia and New Zealand which reflects the importance and value their governments place \non introducing reforms and building capacity for private sector development in the Pacific.   \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) for Phase IV (PSDI IV) will build on Phase III achievements \nacross six core areas of focus: access to finance, business law reform, state-owned enterprise \n(SOE) reform, public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs), competition and consumer protection, and the \neconomic empowerment of women. PSDI IV will retain these areas of focus and also respond to \nclimate change and labor mobility by incorporating these issues into relevant subprojects.3 \n \n3.  A 2018 review of PSDI by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department (IED) found that the \nfirst three phases helped provide several important inputs necessary for establishing modern, \nfunctioning private sectors in Pacific DMCs.4 While concluding that PSDI remained relevant and \nwell-aligned  with  these  DMCs\u2019  needs,  IED  made  recommendations  aimed  at  improving \noutcomes.5 These recommendations have been incorporated into PSDI IV.  PSDI IV is consistent \nwith ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and aligned with the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, \n2016\u20132020. The TA is included in the Pacific Regional Operations Business Plan, 2019\u20132021.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Multiple and persistent constraints on private sector development. Despite progress, \nsustained engagement is needed to shift and remove the many barriers to healthier private \nsectors in Pacific DMCs. Most Pacific DMCs are remote, small in size and population, and \nvulnerable to shocks. Geographical dispersion and distance from major markets limit competition \n \n1  The 14 Pacific developing member countries are the Cook Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, \nthe Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu. \n2 ADB. 2006.

Summary of the Major Achievements under Pacific Private \nSector Development Initiative, Phases I to III (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n3 The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 July 2019. \n4  Independent Evaluation Department. 2018. Performance Evaluation Report. Pacific Private Sector Development \nInitiative. Manila: ADB. \n5  The Independent Evaluation Department report concluded that ADB needs to provide greater strategic guidance, \nreview the management model for PSDI, put in place a fully functioning monitoring and evaluation system that \nincludes mapping out the results chain of subprograms, and rethink and enhance the focus area on the economic \nempowerment of women. See Management Response to the Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s Performance \nEvaluation Report on the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 3). \n6 ADB. 2018.

Complex legislation and weak policies, along with human and institutional \ncapacity constraints, raise the cost of doing business, make it hard for financiers and investors to \nassess risks, suppress business access to finance, and slow economic growth. Policy reforms \nhave proven critical to improving these business environments so far. Private investment and \ngrowth trajectories have been lifted through PSDI I-III, and trade and connectivity within the Pacific \nand other markets has increased. Pacific DMCs are seeking further assistance under PSDI IV to \naccelerate and expand these reforms and address the numerous challenges that remain. \n \n5.  Limited  access  to  financial  services.  Businesses  in  the  Pacific  continue  to  face \ndifficulties raising funds to meet their cash flow needs or expand their operations. Collateral \nframeworks have traditionally favored real assets. Local financial institutions lack risk-assessment \ncapacity, and would-be borrowers are rarely able to develop bankable proposals. PSDI-led \nreforms have made it easier to secure credit using moveable assets by helping implement \npersonal property securities acts (PPSAs) in nine Pacific DMCs. Further exploration is needed to \ndetermine how innovative financing instruments, including integrated fintech solutions, can be \nintroduced to give entrepreneurs better access to credit at reduced costs. \n \n6.  Crowding out by underperforming state-owned enterprises. SOEs are a dominant \npresence in Pacific economies and often crowd the private sector out of commercially viable \nsectors and investment activities. Government subsidies for underperforming SOEs remain a \ndrain on limited public funds.7 Although PSDI-supported reforms have improved the operations of \nSOEs in five Pacific DMCs, more legal, regulatory, and governance support is needed to further \nenhance the performance of SOEs and establish mechanisms for greater accountability and \ntransparency. Greater private sector participation will also be explored. \n \n7.  Doing  business  still  difficult  and  costly.  Many  outdated  laws,  regulations,  and \ncontracting arrangements in the Pacific do not meet the current needs of businesses or encourage \nmicro and small businesses to join the formal economy. Samoa is the highest-placed Pacific \ncountry on the World Bank Group\u2019s annual ease of doing business ranking.8 The Pacific lags \nbehind other regions in the reform areas of the Doing Business 2019, namely starting a business, \ngetting credit, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency.9 However, the report does recognize \nthe reforms PSDI has helped implement to improve the region\u2019s business environments, which \nare reflected by a rise by Pacific DMCs in its rankings, particularly in the areas of starting a \nbusiness and getting credit (footnote 8). These reforms include PSDI work to help address often \ncomplex, unclear, and costly business laws that have made forming a business difficult and \nexpensive. Business start-up times nonetheless remain long, and the costs are still high. To \nremove constraints on private sector development additional support is needed for further reforms \nthat are backed by technology solutions.10  \n \n7  ADB. 2016. Finding Balance 2016: Benchmarking the Performance of State-owned Enterprises in Island Countries. \nManila. \n8  See https://www.doingbusiness.org/content/dam/doingBusiness/media/Profiles/Regional/DB2019/EAP.pdf \n9  Five of eight Pacific countries measured are ranked 98 or lower on starting a business, and 99 or lower on getting \ncredit. Seven of eight are ranked 94 or lower on enforcing contracts, and all eight are ranked 96 or lower on resolving \ninsolvency. \n10 ADB. The Marshall Islands: A Private Sector Assessment.

Markets impaired by weak or \nineffective competition hurt consumers, businesses, private sector development, and economic \ngrowth. Lack of competition and barriers to entry limit consumer choice and drive up costs for \ngoods and services. Business opportunity is stifled, particularly for micro, small, and medium-\nsized enterprises. Competition policy\u2014with competition laws to implement it\u2014is essential to \nensuring competitive and healthy markets. This is true in markets where competition is nascent, \nSOEs dominate, or a handful of large private enterprises occupy multiple economic sectors. PSDI \nhas started work in one DMC and will continue this work and expand to at least one more DMC. \n \n9.  Economic power and potential of women not yet fully realized. The vast potential of \nwomen to spur greater economic and inclusive growth remains largely unrealized in the Pacific. \nWomen continue to be underrepresented in the formal economy due to discriminatory laws, \nfinancial constraints and inequitable access to resources imposed by social norms, customary \npractices, and structural barriers in the business sector. These factors together prevent women \nfrom fully participating in socioeconomic activities, engaging in sustainable livelihood strategies, \naccessing services, and leveraging economic benefits. Women in the Pacific often have limited \nownership  and  little  control  over  assets  and  limited  access  to  training,  professional  skills \ndevelopment,  and  educational  opportunities. 11  Businesswomen  restricted  to  the  informal \neconomy face other challenges. They generally have limited ability to avail government business \nopportunities, to enter into formal contracts, and to access financial services. Women and their \nbusinesses also have limited access to legal protections such as insurance or pension coverage. \nOnce  they  enter  formal  business  enterprises  and  sectors,  women  often  face  inequitable \ngovernance  structures  that  limit  their  access  to  career  advancement,  leadership  training, \npromotions,  and  flexible  work  arrangements.  PSDI  has  implemented  gender  targeted  pilot \nprojects, but will integrate economic empowerment of women across all work streams in PSDI IV. \n \n10.  Broad in-depth challenges in Papua New Guinea. The environment for private sector \ndevelopment  remains constrained  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG)  as well  as  the  necessary \nconditions for supporting long-term economic growth that is sustainable and inclusive. PNG, the \nPacific\u2019s largest economy and most populous country, has been a significant user of PSDI \nexpertise so far. Even though more than 80% of the country\u2019s people depend on the agriculture \nsector for income, PNG\u2019s farmers still have difficulty financing their operations. The country\u2019s \nSOEs have extremely high debt levels, and decision making has been politicized. Poor SOE \nprofitability has led to poor delivery of key infrastructure and services. Although approved, a \ncompetition policy is still to be implemented. Women face systemic legal and institutional barriers \nto full engagement in the economy. The enormous cost of foregoing the productive potential of \none half of the population is exacerbated by the country\u2019s difficult geography, widely dispersed \npopulation, infrastructure and service deficits, and dearth of economic opportunities.12 Australia \nprovided dedicated cofinancing for PNG in phase III and this will continue in PSDI IV. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: inclusive, private sector-led economic growth \n \n11 ADB. 2018. Women and Business in the Pacific. Manila. \n12 Targeted Reform Program for Papua New Guinea under Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase IV \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n \n ", "4 \nachieved in Pacific DMCs.13 The TA will have the following outcome: gender-inclusive enabling \nenvironment for private sector development improved.14  \n \n12.  The  TA  will  continue  to  focus  on  the  six  core  areas  (para.  2)  with  the  economic \nempowerment of women mainstreamed through subprojects. Where appropriate and in response \nto Pacific government demand, the subprojects will incorporate ways to address climate change, \nthe need to capture benefits from labor mobility, and the growing importance of increasing private \nsector participation in such industries as agriculture and tourism.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Access to inclusive business finance improved. PSDI has considerably \nbroadened access to finance through its support for extensive financial sector reforms. These \nreforms have strengthened financial institutions and legal and regulatory frameworks, enhanced \ncapacity, and developed new financial instruments and products to meet the evolving needs for \nprivate sector credit, particularly by women. PSDI IV will build on the secured transaction reforms \nthat resulted in at least 70,000 new loans for small businesses and households after PPSAs were \nimplemented in nine Pacific DMCs.15 With a particular focus on women, PSDI IV will (i) introduce \nsecured transaction reforms in at least one more Pacific DMC and ensure that all registries \ncapture  sex-disaggregated  data;  (ii)  establish  alternative  capital-raising  platforms,  including \nintegrated fintech solutions in coordination with the Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme;16 (iii) \nstrengthen selected state-owned banks by improving policies, regulations, and procedures for \nlending;  (iv)  improve  the  operations  of  national  provident  funds,  develop  their  investment \nmanagement frameworks to international standards, and explore contribution options for labor \nscheme workers; (v) support financial institutions in developing financing products and services \nand improving financial literacy; and (vi) support central banks through the establishment of \nmacroprudential and other financial sector stability frameworks.17 \n \n14.  In delivering Output 1, the TA will (i) advise the Bank of PNG on macroprudential policy \nand instruments and help complete an initial financial sector stability report; (ii) work with the Bank \nof PNG, the Treasury, and the PNG Securities Commission to expand use of alternative capital-\nraising platforms to boost access to finance for small business; (iii) assist the Bank of PNG in \ndeveloping a regulatory framework for cryptoassets and initial coin offerings; and (iv) enable \nWomen\u2019s Micro Bank to expand credit to businesses owned by women.  \n \n15.  Output  2:  Business  and  regulatory  environment  improved,  and  technology \nplatforms introduced. PSDI has supported more than 60 initiatives in 11 Pacific DMCs to reform \na wide range of laws governing business entry, business licensing, compliance, and foreign \ninvestment. In the four DMCs where PSDI implemented registries, this resulted in reducing the \naverage time needed to register a business to less than 2 days and new company formation grew \nby an average of 88% in 2017. PSDI IV will build on the results by (i) reforming company laws \nand establish business registries in at least two more Pacific DMCs; (ii) providing additional \n \n13 ADB. 2019.

Annual Progress Report, 2017\u20132018. Sydney.  \n16  The Pacific Financial Inclusion Programme supports innovative approaches in the development of financial services. \nIt is administered by the United Nations Capital Development Fund and the United Nations Development Programme. \n17 PSDI will ensure that any work with Pacific central banks is aligned with the activities of the International Monetary \nFund or its regional arm, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre. \n ", "5 \nsupport  to  capture  the  benefits  of  improved  information  and  communication  technology \nconnectivity in countries where registries already exist; and (iii) promoting women entrepreneurs \nthrough training. The TA will also ensure that business registries capture sex-disaggregated \ndata\u2014an important step since most women-owned businesses are currently informal. Where \npossible, legal changes will be accompanied by the establishment of online business registries, \nwhich also help governments implement the reforms. In PNG, a multipurpose online registry is \nplanned that will support all aspects of business operations and link to key government agencies. \n \n16.  Output  3:  State-owned  enterprise  performance  improved  through  reforms, \nincluding privatization and public\u2013private partnerships. The core infrastructure services \nlargely provided by SOEs in the Pacific include airports, ports, broadcasting, telecommunication, \nwater  supply  and  sanitation.  To  ensure  these  services  meet  the  needs  of  the  public  and \nbusinesses, SOEs need to operate within a commercial framework and be subject to disciplines \nfound in the private sector. Of the 78 SOE reform initiatives PSDI has supported in 14 Pacific \nDMCs so far, 38 have involved PPPs. This work has helped strengthen SOEs and make them \nmore profitable, reduced government fiscal transfers, and expanded and upgraded service \ndelivery. PSDI IV will continue to provide legal, restructuring, and governance support for SOEs \nto (i) improve their regulatory frameworks and establish online portals that capture data on their \nperformance, (ii) restructure and attract private investment, and (iii) increase the role of women \nthrough policy change and training in decision making. Where it is appropriate, transaction \nadvisory services will support the SOE privatization and the structuring of PPPs.18  \n \n17.  The TA will also respond to the PNG government\u2019s request for an extensive reform \nprogram to improve the management and performance of the country\u2019s struggling SOEs. The \nprogram envisaged includes (i) a new policy to guide overall future SOE reform; (ii) reforms to be \nadopted as law to improve SOE accountability, reporting, transparency, and overall governance; \n(iii) case-by-case reforms to put individual SOEs on the path to financial sustainability; and (iv) \nincreased private sector participation through PPPs and privatization in SOE service delivery. \n \n18.  Output 4: Effective competition and consumer protection policies developed and \nimplemented. PSDI IV will support competition policy and law reforms needed to develop private \nsectors, give the Pacific\u2019s consumers better value for their money, offer small and medium-sized \nenterprises and other businesses a fair chance to enter markets and grow, and level the playing \nfield  for  more  robust  economic  development.  PSDI  has  supported  the  development  and \ngovernment endorsement of national competition policies in four Pacific DMCs so far, and PNG \nis now drafting the related implementing law. PSDI IV will (i) develop and implement policies and \nlaws that support both fair competition and consumer protection in three more Pacific DMCs; (ii) \nensure gender issues are incorporated in competition and consumer protection frameworks; and \n(iii) help build the capacity of competition commissions to develop guidelines and train officers. \nThe focus in PNG will be on the formulation and passage of a competition bill. The TA will also \nwork  to  help  PNG\u2019s  Independent  Consumer  and  Competition  Commission  to  enhance  its \ncomplaints process, concentrating on better access for women consumers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $16.03 million, of which (i) $1.00 million will be financed on a \n \n18  Transaction advisory services will be coordinated with ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnerships. Such TA \nundertakings will at all times observe the provisions of ADB\u2019s Operations Manual Policies and Procedures and the \nStaff Instruction on Transaction Advisory Services. \n \n ", "6 \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); (ii) $1.00 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF Others); and (iii) \n$14.03  million  will  be  cofinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Government  of  Australia  and \nadministered by ADB.19 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.20 In recognition of the \nscale of the issues in the country and the potential for private sector development, Australia\u2019s \nDepartment of Foreign Affairs and Trade is dedicating $7.01 million in cofinancing for activities in \nPNG. The subprojects in the TA work program for PNG will support delivery of all four outputs.21 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department, through its Pacific Liaison \nand Coordination Office in Sydney, will administer and implement the TA over 60 months from 1 \nNovember 2019 to 31 October 2024. The Regional Director, Pacific Liaison and Coordination \nOffice and the responsible project officer will monitor and oversee implementation of the TA. ADB \nwill engage consultants and carry out procurement following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and its associated project administration and staff instructions. TA \nproceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Consultants recruited will comply with applicable ADB \npolicies and guidelines. PSDI IV will use ADB\u2019s Knowledge Nexus to ensure coordination with \nother ADB departments and offices providing private sector support in the Pacific and to store all \nknowledge products produced. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  November 2019\u2013October 2024 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB with the support of PSDI core consultants \nFirms (QCBS with a 90:10 ratio)  New registries  $0.80 million \nFirms (QBS)  Specialized inputs  $0.20 million \nIndividual international consultants (ICS)  556 person-months  $9.63 million \n  Individual national consultants (ICS)  144 person-months  $1.16 million \n  Resource person contracts will be considered on need basis. \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB with the support of the PSDI core consultants \nAdvance contracting  Advance contracting will be used for PSDI core consultant recruitment and \nprocurement of other minor office expenses. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), in accordance with \nthe agreed cost-sharing ratios. In consultation with cofinanciers, ADB may use its \ndiscretion in determining which funding sources should be utilized first. \nAsset turnover or  Assets acquired will either be transferred to any subsequent phases of PSDI or \ndisposal arrangement  provided to Pacific DMCs, as determined by the steering committee (para. 22). \nupon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection, PSDI = Pacific Private Sector Development \nInitiative, QBS = quality-based selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19 Additional cofinancing is anticipated in 2020, including $8.87 million from the European Union, and $4.00 million from \nthe Government of New Zealand. \n20 Opportunities for Intervention under Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase IV (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 3).  \n21 In addition to consultants working to deliver the four outputs, PSDI IV will continue to have two full-time consultants \nbased in ADB\u2019s Resident Mission in PNG. These in-country coordinators will assist in managing the country program \nand coordinate directly with PNG government agencies and Australia\u2019s High Commission to PNG. \n \n ", "7 \n21.  Consulting services. The TA will require 556 person-months of individual international \nconsultants, 144 person-months of individual national consultants, and the services of consulting \nfirms. Up to nine full-time consultants\u2014six international (320 person-months), and three national \n(144 person-months)\u2014will be recruited for the PSDI core team using individual consultant \nselection.22 Specialist short-term consultants and firms will be recruited to provide technical \nexpertise for on-demand assignments in Pacific DMCs. The requirements and the length of \nengagement will vary based on the scope of work. The specialist individual consultants and firms \nwill be recruited using a combination of individual consultant selection, quality-based selection, \n \nquality- and cost-based selection, and resource person contracting methods.\n \n \n22.  Governance and coordination. A steering committee of representatives of ADB and \ncofinancing  partners  will  be  established  to  strengthen  governance  and  coordination  and \nimplement one of the IED report recommendations (footnote 5).23 This committee will meet at \nleast  every  6 months  to  review  accomplishments  and the forward  work  program.  The  TA \nconsultants will work closely with ADB\u2019s Pacific resident missions and country offices and comply \nwith in-country mission guidelines.24 Within ADB, the previous phases of PSDI worked closely \nwith the Private Sector Operations Department and the Office of Public-Private Partnership. PSDI \nshared its experience and knowledge with these departments to help them understand the \nintricacies  of  working  in  the  Pacific, forwarded  opportunities  for  potential  investments,  and \nundertook due diligence or pre-feasibility analysis to support potential transactions. Under PSDI \nIV, these arrangements will deepen as ADB strives for more private sector transactions in the \nPacific and ADB staff are collocated with PSDI. 25 A part-time monitoring and evaluation specialist \nwill  be  recruited  to  coordinate  evaluation  activities  and  ensure  that  evaluation  reports  are \n \nproduced and completed in line with the individual subprojects\u2019 work scope and timelines.\n \n23.  Knowledge,  social  media,  and  websites.  PSDI  will  continue  to  produce  flagship \npublications to share best practices and establish a research basis for future subprojects.26 PSDI \nmaintains a website and social media account and shares content with the ADB\u2019s website and \nsocial media accounts.27 This will be expanded to partner websites and social media accounts. \nPSDI  IV  will  continue  to  maintain  and  upgrade  its  website  and  social  media  accounts. \nArrangements for preserving this information after TA completion will be negotiated by the project \nofficer with the PSDI partners and ADB\u2019s Department of Communications. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nADB administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $14,026,000 \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia; and (ii) ADB providing the \nequivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, \nPhase IV, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n22 It will not be cost-effective to use a firm, given the complex roles that require specific expertise. Similarly, national \nconsultants will provide administrative support. A full-time expert will be engaged to focus on economic empowerment \nof women.
