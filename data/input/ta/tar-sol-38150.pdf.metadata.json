The Government of Solomon Islands (the Government) has requested support from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for Implementation of \nInterisland Transport Reforms. The Project was initially discussed with the Government during \nthe country programming mission1 undertaken in March 2004, and refined during a fact-finding \nmission2 undertaken in February 2005 to assess the proposed project components. The findings \nof these missions, in the form of a draft TA paper, have been discussed with the Government, \nwhich has agreed with the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference. 3\n \n2.  The goals and objectives of this TA complement the Solomon Islands Country Strategy \nand Program Update 2005\u20132006,4 which aims to achieve rapid, pro-poor, and private sector-led \neconomic  growth  by  (i) strengthening  the  enabling  environment  for  the  private  sector,  and \n(ii) providing transport infrastructure and services. The TA supports the Government\u2019s policy \nframework set out in the National Economic Recovery, Reform and Development Plan 2003\u2013\n20065 (NERRDP) through its focus on transport for development and is closely coordinated with \nrelated TA in the country program described below. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Solomon Islands is one of the least developed among ADB\u2018s Pacific developing member \ncountries (PDMCs). Measured by the most recent United Nations human development index \n(HDI) and human poverty index (HPI), Solomon Islands ranks below all but one PDMC, and the \ncountry is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. Development \nwas set back significantly by several years of severe conflict that ended in 2003.  \n \n4.  The national economy relies on forestry, fisheries, and cocoa and copra production, all \nconducted in rural areas. The vast majority of the population lives on rural subsistence, and \nsocial and economic disparities between the capital of Honiara and the provinces are wide. \nSuccessive governments have not succeeded in providing adequate infrastructure and services, \nespecially in rural areas, nor in facilitating income-generating opportunities outside Honiara.  \n \n5.  Pro-poor economic growth depends on increased productivity in rural areas. Improved \ninterisland transportation infrastructure and services, and thus reliable access to domestic and \ninternational markets for rural produce and commodities, will be a key strategy to restart and \nbuild rural economies, reduce the demand for migration to the capital in search of employment, \nreduce conflict between groups competing for limited opportunities, and address the challenge \nof restoring basic social services in rural areas. \n \n6.  Interisland  transport  between  Solomon  Islands\u2019  70-plus  inhabited  islands  is \ncharacterized  by  long  distances,  infrequent  and  unreliable  schedules,  and  unsafe  vessels. \n                                                 \n1  Comprising W.

", "2 \nOutside the capital of Honiara, the country has always had a very limited infrastructure stock \nand the poor state of transport services poses considerable barriers to market access and \nimpedes the growth of rural production. These conditions have had pervasive negative social \neffects by limiting rural-urban linkages, labor mobility, and interprovincial trade. \n \n7.  In the shipping sector, most provinces own and operate small vessels that were granted \nto them when the national shipping service was disbanded. Since restructuring, many services \nhave been mismanaged, are essentially insolvent, or have ceased operating. Although some \ndestinations receive one service a week, frequencies of once a month, or less, are common and \nschedules  are  unreliable.  Some  viable  services  are  provided  by  the  private  sector,  but \npassenger services are less well catered for.  \n \n8.  Major  impediments  to  sustainable  shipping  in  Solomon  Islands  are  the  absence  of \neffective government policy to promote shipping investment and safe operations, and provincial \ninterference in the market. Financial difficulties brought about by poorly run operations, weak \ngovernance,  and  political  pressure  have  meant  that  revenues  are  generally  insufficient  to \nmaintain and operate the domestic fleet, leading to severe underinvestment in maintenance and \nserious concerns regarding safety.  \n \n9.  Some of the major routes are commercially viable, but some other routes may require \nsome public sector support to provide social services. The proposed policy objective is to \nensure that as many routes as possible become both economically sustainable and affordable \nwithout government intervention. For those that require support, a related ADB TA will establish \na  Transport  Development  Trust  Fund  to  enable  targeted  subsidies  for  a  franchise  tender \nscheme and ensure a minimum level of service on prioritized uneconomic routes.6\n \n10.  The potential for transportation reform is complicated by institutional, regulatory, and \nfinancial  problems.  The  central  and  provincial  governments  own  some  of  the  significant \noperators, and their dominant positions have crowded out the private sector and raised costs \nthroughout the economy through inefficiency. Operators are self-regulating by default due to \ninstitutional weaknesses and the absence of senior management staff in key positions, and \nthere has been little effective safety or economic oversight of operations for many years.  \n \n11.  The work of restructuring and privatization in the maritime sector must be supported by \nassociated policy, regulatory, and legislative reforms to ensure safety and liberalize market \nopportunities. The Government has recognized that sector reform is urgently required and has \nset out a broad policy framework in the NERRDP, but requires sector-specific assistance to \ndesign and operationalize these reforms and build a consensus on their implementation across \nall involved ministries.  \n \n12.  The proposed TA will improve provision of interisland transportation through reform of \nthe institutional context that governs operations, support for private sector development, and \ntraining of stakeholders to facilitate participation. By supporting rural economic growth and \naccess to health and education, ADB's program will make a positive contribution to moving \nSolomon Islands closer to meeting the MDG on poverty. \n \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The goal of the TA is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of interisland sea \ntransport services in Solomon Islands, while minimizing the fiscal burden and exposure to risk to \npublic institutions and finances. The purpose is to assess the status of interisland transport \nservices, determine constraints to their development, develop strategies for improvement, and \nimplement the necessary reforms.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will contain four main components: (i) institutional reforms, (ii) financial reforms, \n(iii) private sector development, and (iv) training. Each component will be developed through \noperational,  financial,  and  institutional  analysis;  assessment  of  alternatives;  stakeholder \nconsultations; strategic planning; and implementation assistance. \n \n15.  The institutional reform component is intended to create an environment conducive to \nprivate sector investment and efficient operations. It will include review and revision of relevant \npolicies, regulations, and legislation to remove constraints to sector development. In particular, \nactivities  under  this  component  will  update  the  Shipping  and  Foreign  Investment  Acts; \nmodernize the national ship register; harmonize provincial licensing regimes; and assist with \nlegal drafting to implement the reforms. \n \n16.  The financial reform component is intended to improve the financial viability of both \noperators and regulatory agencies. It will include design of a franchise-tendering scheme for \nuneconomic routes, provision of supply and demand data to assist commercial planning, and \nreview and restructuring of national and provincial maritime fees. \n \n17.  The private sector development component is intended to provide targeted support for \nexisting and new operators in the shipping sector, and to prepare for privatization transactions in \nthe maritime sector. It will revitalize the Solomon Islands Ship Owners Association as a vehicle \nfor cooperative training and consultation, develop data on demand and supply of services to \nsupport  marketing  and  implementation  of  the  franchise-tendering  scheme,  and  prepare \ndocumentation  and  evaluation  processes  to  support  privatization  of  selected  public  sector \noperators. \n \n18.  The training component is intended to support the other three components by increasing \nthe ability of public and private sector regulators and operators to work effectively within a \nreformed  and  liberalized  environment.  It  will  include  small-business  training  for  staff  and \ndirectors of transport operators, sector-specific commercial training for Commerce Department \nextension officers, and safety regulatory training for Marine Division staff. It will also include \nstructured short-term visits between Solomon Islands and neighboring countries for on-the-job \ntraining in similar shipping operations. \n \n19.  A number of recent studies7 have established baseline data and descriptions for the \nmaritime sector. Where necessary and available, new data may be collected or updated.

The TA will then develop alternatives for reform of policy, regulation, and legislation \nintended to create an environment conducive to private sector participation through contestable \nmarket solutions that are appropriate to the Solomon Islands economy. Particular attention will \nbe paid to factors such as provincial economic regulation, national government policies on \ninvestment and maintenance, safety oversight, and ownership restrictions that may affect costs \nand hinder efficiency. \n \n21.  Extensive  stakeholder  consultations  are  expected  to  verify  the  analyses  and  build \nconsensus toward preferred reforms. Two national workshops will be conducted, one primarily \nfor government and public service officials to develop policy, and one primarily for operators and \nusers to propose and evaluate implementation options. Consultations will be facilitated through \na communications plan that includes preparation and dissemination of information on the TA \nfindings targeted at the intended audience through appropriate media.  \n \n22.  The TA will culminate in development and implementation of strategies and action plans \nfor  reform,  through  an  overall  private  sector  participation  strategy  for  interisland  transport, \nincluding policy and regulatory reforms that may be desirable to facilitate the recommendations. \n \n23.  Implementation  assistance  will  be  provided  to  document  and  promote  potential \ntransactions, including service concessions and privatization of public sector operators. This will \ninclude preparation of information memoranda, design of tender procedures, and assistance in \nbid evaluation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n24.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent, of which the foreign \nexchange component is $455,000 and the local currency component is $145,000 equivalent. \nADB will finance all of the foreign exchange costs and $40,000 of the local costs on a grant \nbasis, financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of Solomon Islands will finance \n$105,000 equivalent of the local currency costs through domestic resources. Detailed cost \nestimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Ministry of Finance, National Reform, and \nPlanning. The implementing agency will be the Ministry of Infrastructure and Development, with \nthe undersecretary of the Department of Infrastructure as the TA coordinator. A Transport Task \nForce, to be formed in mid-2005 under the chairmanship of the permanent secretary of the \nDepartment of National Reform and Planning and comprising members from relevant ministries \nand  the  private  sector,  will  serve  as  the  project  steering  committee  to  oversee  the \nimplementation of the TA.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \nInfrastructure and Development; ADB. 2004.

The  TA  will  be  coordinated  in  cooperation  with  the  Economic  Reform  Unit  in  the \nDepartment of Finance, which has been formed to oversee, coordinate, and implement private \nsector regulatory reforms; infrastructure service provision policy and regulation; state-owned \nenterprise  reform;  financial  sector  reforms;  provincial  economic  development;  statistical \ncollection service reforms; and specific sector policy reforms to promote new investments in \npotential growth areas.  \n \n27.   The TA will also be closely coordinated with other ADB-financed TA projects. These \ninclude the institutional strengthening project mentioned above, and a state-owned enterprise \nreform  project,  which  will  help  improve  ownership  arrangements,  accountability,  and \nperformance through upstream policy advice, corporate governance reforms, and privatization.8  \n \n28.  A total of 15 person-months of international consulting services are required. Three \nspecialists will be hired as individual consultants: a Maritime Transport Planner and Team \nLeader, a Maritime Operations and Finance Specialist, and a Maritime Training Specialist. Their \nservices will be utilized intermittently over 12 months, starting at the commencement of the TA \nProject in May 2005 and ending at its completion in April 2006. Consulting services will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Terms of reference \nare in Appendix 3.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n29.
