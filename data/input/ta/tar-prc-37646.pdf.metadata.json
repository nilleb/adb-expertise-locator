INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2003  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance in \ncarrying  out  a  flood  management  strategy  study.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  was \nsubsequently included in the PRC country strategy and program (2004\u20132006). A fact-finding \nmission visited the PRC in January 2004 to hold discussions with staff from the Ministry of \nWater Resources (MWR) and reached an understanding with the Government on the detailed \nobjectives, scope, costs, implementation, and financing arrangements for the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC has had a long history of serious loss of life and damage to property due to \nflooding. The country has had more than 1,000 major flood disasters in 2,000 years of recorded \nhistory, for an average of one every 2 years. Yangtze River floods in 1931 inundated 3.3 million \nhectares (ha) of farmland, affecting 28.5 million people and causing 145,000 deaths. Most \nrecently, in 1998, the Yangtze and Songhua-Liao river basins flooded more than 2.5 million ha, \ndamaging 7 million houses and killing 3,500. The 1998 flood resulted in monetary losses of $30 \nbillion at the current exchange rate, and effectively reduced about 3\u20134% of gross domestic \nproduct (GDP). Though these are estimates, the figures clearly demonstrate the detrimental \neffect  of  such  floods  on  economic  growth  and  human  welfare.  Disastrous  floods  have, \nmoreover, increased in frequency, from an average of 7 in the 1960s to 34 in the 1990s. Floods \nare natural repeat phenomena that will be increasingly costly to the economy as the population \ngrows, development accelerates, and the floodplains are more densely settled. \n \n3.  The nationwide floods of 1998 were a wake-up call for the Government, prompting it to \nlaunch a program to strengthen flood protection in major river basins in the PRC, and to hike its \ninvestments2 in flood control and dike reinforcement. Yet the risk of destructive flooding persists, \neconomic damage remains high, and the toll in human lives and social devastation, particularly \nfor the poor, is enormous. A gradually increasing proportion of assistance is now being directed \nto improving flood forecasting and developing decision support systems to better manage flood \nemergencies.3 The Government has begun to emphasize the effectiveness of control measures, \nand  is  attempting  to  go  beyond  exclusive  reliance  on  structural  solutions  by  integrating \nnonstructural measures.  \n \n4.  The Government has passed floodplain zoning and use control legislation (Flood Control \nLaw, 1997) to complement flood management measures. In the wake of the 1998 flood, a new \npolicy4 was announced. The policy emphasizes the need to move toward natural resource \nmanagement as a long-term, holistic way of flood plain management, and signals a shift from \ndependence on structural measures for reducing flood damage to a balanced approach using \nboth structural and nonstructural measures. Retracting some dikes, dredging riverbeds, and \n                                                           \n1\n  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 August 2003. It is also included under \nADB. 2003. A Pilot Study for Delegation of Consultant Recruitment and Supervision under Technical Assistance to \nExecuting Agencies. Manila (Board Paper R157-03, dated 29 August 2003). \n2  See the footnote 1 in Appendix 3. \n3  See the footnote 2 in Appendix 3. \n4\n  The policy calls for planting trees, transforming arable land back into forests, demolishing polder fields to release \nfloods, transforming farmland back into lakes, supplying labor as contribution, relocating people to build townships, \nreinforcing river levees, and dredging river channels and lakes. Under the initiative, the PRC is renewing flood \ncontrol plans for all major river basins.  ", "2 \nreturning farmland to lakes to increase the flow capacity of rivers are some of the initiatives \nsupported. A nonstructural measure espoused by this policy is relocating villages from highly \nhazardous,  flood-prone  areas  and  returning  the  land  to  temporary  flood  storage.  Various \nmeasures introduced in this regard recently have met only limited success: (i) The detention \nbasin concept entails huge relocation costs. (ii) Wetland restoration, to increase the capacity of \nwetlands to absorb floodwater, needs synchronized planning and implementation, and takes a \nlong period to be effective. (iii) A pilot flood insurance system for financial cost recovery drew \ninsufficient  interest  from  affected  communities  and  business  entities.  (iv) Flood  zoning  is \nrequired by law but requires further efforts to have floodplains management integrated with \nother land-use planning. (v) River basin organizations5 are authorized to manage water-related \naffairs  in  their  river  basins,  but  do  not  have  enough  authority  to  carry  out  floodplains \nmanagement across provinces. The Government recognizes the importance of nonstructural \nflood mitigation measures, but also believes that critical assessment is necessary and long \noverdue  to  (a)  analyze  the  performance  of  various  nonstructural  measures  and  their \neffectiveness under different conditions, and (b) determine factors that affect the effective and \nefficient implementation of the various measures. Such an assessment will provide an overall \nframework for flood mitigation and integrated floodplain management and will enable the most \nsuitable measures to suit different local situations to be defined.6 \n \n5.  Modern  flood  mitigation  and  floodplain  management  recognizes  five  types  of  flood \nresponse measures: structural measures to keep floodwaters away from the people (flood \ncontrol), land-use controls to keep people away from the floodwaters, development and building \ncontrols to limit the hazard and damage to property and buildings in flood-prone areas, flood \nemergency measures to deal with overwhelming floods, and flood insurance mechanisms to link \nfinancial responsibilities with flood risks. The last four types of management measures are \ncollectively  referred  to  as  nonstructural  flood  management  measures.  Effective  integrated \nfloodplain management requires the appropriate mix of structural and nonstructural measures, \naccording to the flood risk, flood hazard, and flood behavior conditions at the site of interest and \nthe nature and roles of jurisdictional authority. Other than forecasting and warning for decision \nsupport systems, government officials in the PRC are in general insufficiently informed about (i) \nthe  nature  of  nonstructural  measures;  (ii)  their  legal,  institutional,  and  administrative \npreconditions; and (iii) integrated floodplains management approaches. Low awareness of the \nnatures, types, and applicability of nonstructural measures further inhibits the PRC from moving \nforward  to  the  integrated  floodplains  management  balancing  structural  and  nonstructural \nmeasures. International experience and lessons from developed countries in these areas would \nheighten awareness of integrated floodplains management in the PRC. \n \n6.  While structural and flood emergency management measures will still be required for \nimmediate protections of floodplains from floodwater, balancing flood mitigation and floodplains \nmanagement may be most effective in reducing flood risk and flood damage for the long term. \nThe Government is, however, still searching for suitable and effective nonstructural measures \nfor  the  different  flooding  situations  and  development  characteristics  in  the  country.  The \nGovernment has requested assistance from ADB to formulate a properly balanced framework \n                                                           \n5\n  In the PRC, seven river basin water resources commissions have been established, covering majority of the land \narea; they are Haihe, Huaihe, Pearl, Song-Liao, Yangtze, Yellow rivers, and Taihu Lake basin. Flood emergency \nresponses are mainly the responsibility of the Office of Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, while \nactual implementation of flood control measures still remains a local government responsibility. The MWR guides \noverall planning and policy. \n6\n  The need has been noted in the Policies and Measures on Flood Disaster Reduction in China since 1998 (2003, \nUnited Nations) and Strategic Options for the Water Sector (ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China for Strategic Options for the Water Sector. Manila). ", "3 \nfor an integrated flood management strategy, taking into account (i) the nature of nonstructural \nmanagement measures and their effectiveness in addressing specific development and flooding \nsituations in the country; (ii) social, economic, and environmental considerations in floodplains; \n(iii) legal, institutional, economic, technical, and administrative constraints on integrated flood \nmitigation and floodplains management at the province and local levels; and (iv) ever-increasing \npressure of land shortage versus the risk of flooding, given the speed and pattern of population \ngrowth and economic development. The TA will investigate the constraints on adopting the \nprinciples  of  integrated  flood  mitigation  and  floodplains management,  by  learning  from  the \nexperience and knowledge of developed countries; and will formulate an action plan to improve \nthe effectiveness of the flood management strategy, balancing structural and nonstructural flood \nmanagement measures, in the context of situations specific to the PRC. The TA is consistent \nwith  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  the  PRC7 and  ADB\u2019s  water  sector  policy  in \npromoting integrated water resources management. A comprehensive assessment and action \nplans for balancing structural and nonstructural flood mitigation measures will provide a long-\nterm development plan for both the Government and ADB. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The long-term goal is to promote the sustainable economic and social development of \nflood-prone areas in the PRC through effective flood management measures. The objective of \nthe  TA  is  to  develop  an  integrated  flood  mitigation  and  floodplain  management  strategy \nappropriate  for  the  unique  flooding  and  development  situations  in  the  PRC,  by  balancing \nstructural and nonstructural measures. It will assist the Government in moving from flood control \nto an integrated, or total, flood management strategy. The TA will have three main outputs: (i) a \nreview of structural and nonstructural measures, and an assessment of their effectiveness in the \nPRC; (ii) a framework for flood mitigation and floodplains management balancing structural and \nnonstructural measures in the PRC, arrived at through an analysis of the best international \npractices;  and  (iii)  action  plans  to  implement  integrated  flood  mitigation  and  floodplains \nmanagement approach. The study will produce a handbook of effective flood management \nframework for decision makers and local government officials. The TA framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The assessment will (i) be based on international practices in flood mitigation, flood risk \ncontrol, and floodplains management; (ii) provide a balanced framework for the mix of structural \nand  nonstructural  flood  management  measures  appropriate  to  different  flooding  and \ndevelopment situations in the PRC; and (iii) incorporate social, economic, and environmental \nconsiderations in flood management planning and be consistent with the principles of integrated \nriver basin management and development. The TA will comprise the following four activities: (i) \ninformation and data gathering through study and international workshops to identify promising \nflood management concepts, theories, and practices overseas; (ii) assessment of structural and \nnonstructural flood management measures in representative provinces8 to identify management \n                                                           \n7\n   ADB. 2003.

These six provinces are affected \nby flooding from the Hai, Huai, Pearl, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers, steep mountain streams draining to the coast or \nto major rivers, and major tributaries of major rivers. ", "4 \nconstraints and other barriers (institutional, legal, social, economic, environmental, etc.); (iii) \nformulation of an action plan to implement integrated flood and floodplains management in the \nPRC; and (iv) dissemination of the handbook of effective flood management framework to \nincrease awareness on the balanced flood management practices.  \n \n9.  Three 2\u2013day workshops will be held to exchange theories, best practices, findings, and \ninternational experiences. Each workshop will take place in a different city to attract local \nparticipants. One workshop will be only for local experts; the other two workshops will include at \nleast three international experts to enhance learning from international experience and lessons. \nThrough  the  International  Knowledge  Centers  of  the  Network  of  Asian  River  Basin \nOrganizations (NARBO),9 exchange of information, lessons, and good practices will be further \nencouraged.  Findings  and  recommendations  will  be  disseminated  at  the  final  workshop. \nNumerous panel meetings will be also conducted as required to incorporate various experts\u2019 \nviews, knowledge, and opinions. Final output will be published as a handbook of effective flood \nmanagement framework for wider circulation to local practitioners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $625,000 equivalent, comprising $284,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $341,000 equivalent in local currency costs. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $500,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs and $216,000 \nequivalent in local costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will provide the balance of local costs, equivalent to $125,000, to \ncover in-kind counterpart costs and services. The Government understands that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project or to extend any further TA for \nimplementing any recommendations of the TA. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare given in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  MWR will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee will be established \nunder it to provide overall guidance in TA implementation. The committee members will be \ndrawn from MWR, Ministry of Finance, National Development and Reform Committee, Ministry \nof Civil Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Land Resources. A TA management office \nwill be set up to administer the day-to-day activities of the TA and coordinate with ADB. The \noffice will comprise representatives from the Department of International Cooperation, Science \nand Technology, Office of National Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, Department \nof Policy and Legislation, Foreign Investment Management Office, and other departments as \nnecessary. MWR will assign an experienced full-time MWR staff member to serve as TA task \nmanager, and counterpart staff to work closely with the TA consultants. MWR will also provide \noffice  space,  access  to  communication  and  copiers,  and  logistical  support  for  TA \nimplementation, using counterpart funds.  \n \n12.  A TA technical panel of experts will be set up as required to provide its opinions on the \nwork of the TA consultants and the counterpart team. The technical experts will come from \n                                                           \n9 The ADB, ADB Institute, and the Japan Water Agency (JWA; formerly Water Resources Development Public \nCorporation) jointly established NARBO through a letter of intent, signed on 21 March 2003 during the 3rd World \nWater Forum. NARBO was officially launched on 20 November 2003 at the 1st South East Asian Water Forum in \nChiang Mai, Thailand. From the PRC, Huai River Basin and Taihu Lake Basin organizations have signed the \npartnerships with NARBO. \n ", "5 \nvarious  agencies  (such  as  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Committee,  Ministry  of \nFinance, nongovernment organizations, and universities), and could include established experts \nin the PRC and other stakeholders as required. The panel will collaborate with the counterpart \nteam in organizing at least three one-day panel meetings during TA implementation (at the start \nof the TA, midway through it, and before its conclusion). \n \n13.  The TA will be carried out over 12 calendar months starting in September 2004 and \nending in September 2005. A total of 36 person-months of consulting services will be required \nfor the TA\u20147 for international and 29 for domestic consultants. Expertise is required in flood \nand  water  resource  management,  institutional,  land-use  planning  and  policy,  flood  risk \nmanagement,  emergency  planning,  environmental  management,  resettlement  and \nsocioeconomic analysis, and legal and institutional analysts. \n \n14.  MWR will select and engage an international consulting firm in association with domestic \nconsultants on the basis of the quality- and cost-based selection method, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  as  amended  to  allow  the  selection  and \nengagements of the consultants by MWR. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be \nfollowed in engaging the consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consulting services \nare  in  Appendix  3.  Equipment,  software,  and  office  supplies  shall  be  procured  by  the \nconsultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n15.  The Government and ADB agree to the inclusion of this TA as one of the selected \nprojects under the pilot study for delegating consultant recruitment and supervision (footnote 1), \napproved  by  ADB.  In  particular,  the  Government  agrees  to  follow  the  implementation \nprocedures outlined in the pilot study Board paper and such other detailed procedures and \npractices as ADB may require. The Government acknowledges that the terms and conditions of \nthe TA framework agreement between the Government and ADB, dated 23 December 1996, \napply to this TA. Pursuant to Section 3.01 of the agreement, ADB will delegate consultant \nselection and supervision for firms under this TA to the Government. The TA Letter Agreement, \nto be issued under the TA framework agreement for this TA, will reflect this arrangement. \nConsultants engaged and supervised by the Government under this TA will have the status of \nexperts  performing  missions  for  ADB  as  accorded  by  the  provisions  of  the  Agreement \nEstablishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  as  further  detailed  in  the  TA  framework \nagreement. \n \n \nIV.

Key Activities \n \n2.  The study will proceed with the four major activities noted in paragraph 8 of the main \ntext.  \n \n3.  Activity  One:  Three  2\u2013Day  Workshops  and  at  least  Three  Technical  Panel \nMeetings.  The  workshops  will  be  conducted  to  exchange  theories,  best  practices,  and \ninternational experience. The workshops will (i) identify promising flood management concepts \nand practices in overseas countries, (ii) assess constraints to moving forward with integrated \nflood management in the PRC context, and (iii) to disseminate findings and action plans and \nincrease awareness on the new concept of integrated floodplains management. Technical panel \nmeetings will be conducted as required to incorporate various experts\u2019 views, knowledge, and \nopinions as the study progresses. Each workshop will take place in different cities to attract local \npractitioners,  while  technical  panel  meetings  will  be  in  Beijing.  At  each  workshop,  the \nconsultants will provide concise presentations of reports for discussion. One workshop will be \nonly for local experts, while the other two workshops will invite at least three international \nexperts at each seminar to enhance local knowledge of international experience and lessons. \nThrough  the  International  Knowledge  Centers  of  the  Network  of  Asian  River  Basin \nOrganizations (NARBO), the consultants will arrange and promote exchange of information, \nlessons, and best practices. The consultants will assess the appropriate time to conduct the first \nworkshop in consultation with MWR, given progress of the study and feasibility of inviting \ninternational  experts.  The  purpose  of  the  first  workshop  is  to  identify  international  flood \nmanagement concepts and practices that may be relevant to the PRC contexts. Participation in \nthe workshop will be by invitation of experts with experience in specific countries.  Invitees will \nbe given a background paper and a list of topics to address at the workshop. At the end of the \neighth  month,  the  consultants  will  conduct  the  second  workshop  to  discuss  constraints  to \nintegrated flood management. At the end of eleventh month, a final workshop will be held to \ndisseminate  findings  and  recommendations  promoting  the  concept  and  actions  suggested. \nTopics to be addressed will include the following (and will be finalized in consultation with MWR \nupon commencing the TA): \n \n(i)  the  history  of  flood  control  and  management  in  other  countries,  agencies, \nincluding problems, changes, and successes and failures; \n(ii)  a comparison of flood behavior and problems elsewhere with those of the PRC; \nin particular, the existence and means of managing flood-prone areas subject to \nhigh levels of land-use pressure and significant flood risk, i.e., increasing hazard \nand damages; \n(iii)  institutional arrangements for flood management at the national, provincial, and \nlocal government levels, including effectives and problems; \n(iv)  institutional arrangements for the management of land-use in flood-prone areas; \n(v)  the  benefits,  successes,  and  failures  of  different  types  of  structural  and \nnonstructural management measures; \n(vi)  the  planning  process  determining  the  appropriate  mix  of  structural  and \nnonstructural management measures; how social, economic, and environmental \nconsiderations  are  incorporated  in  this  process;  stakeholder  roles  and \nresponsibilities in this process; \n(vii)  flood insurance mechanisms; \n                                                           \nimprove flood forecasting for Dongting Lake, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. ADB\u2019s Songhua and \nYellow river flood management projects also adopted nonstructural measures\u2014flood forecasting and modeling. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n(viii)  flood forecasting and the use of decision support systems, including institutional \narrangements and responsibilities; and \n(ix)  flood emergency management, including warning, defence, evacuation, relief, \nand  recovery  activities;  institutional  arrangements,  roles  and  responsibilities, \nsuccess and problems. \n \n4.  Activity Two: Assessment of the Performance of Structural and Nonstructural \nMeasures. The assessment will be done in a selected number of representative provinces to \nidentify  management  constraints  and  other  barriers  (institutional,  legal,  social,  economic, \nenvironmental, etc.) to the implementation of an integrated flood and floodplain management \nprocess in the PRC. All aspects of current flood and floodplain management will be reviewed in \nselected provinces that reflect the flooding and development patterns in the PRC, possibly the \nprovinces of the Hai, Huai, Pearl, Yangtze, and Yellow rivers; steep mountain streams draining \nto the coast; steep mountain streams draining to major rivers; and major tributaries of major \nrivers. Three of these provinces are \u201ceastern\u201d provinces (Guangdong, Hebei, and Zejiang); two \nare  in  the  \u201ccentral  economic  zone\u201d  (Anhui  and  Hunan);  and  the  remaining  province  is  a \n\u201cwestern\u201d province (Shaanxi).  \n \n(i)  Anhui experiences flooding from the Yangtze and Huai rivers. A major flood \noccurred and a number of flood detention areas were used in 2003. \n(ii)  Guangdong is a highly developing area, and suffers from the flooding of the Pearl \nRiver. \n(iii)  Hebei surrounds Beijing and Tianjin cities. The Hai River is almost solely within \nthe province and may provide insights on institutional setup. \n(iv)  Hunan  experiences  flood  problems  with  the  Yangtze,  lakes,  and  tributaries \n(including flash flooding in mountain streams). \n(v)  Shaanxi suffers from flooding by the Yellow River and its largest tributary. \n(vi)  Zejiang has many small steep rivers that drain to the sea, with rapid economic \ndevelopment and urbanization. \n \n5.  The consultants will consult with MWR to finalize the selection, upon commencing the \nwork. \n \n6.  Reviews of flooding and flood management in these provinces will address \n \n(i)  the legal and institutional bases for flood and floodplain management and land-\nuse  controls  at  the  national,  river  basin  commission,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernment levels; and the effectiveness of existing land-use controls; \n(ii)  the flood and floodplain management role, responsibility, and actions of the \nassociated river basin commissions; their success or otherwise; links, inter-\nrelationships,  and  consistency  between  the  river  basin  commissions  and \nprovinces regarding flood and floodplain management; \n(iii)  what  structural  and  nonstructural  management  measures  are  used  in  the \nprovinces; \n(iv)  the flood management decision-making process at all levels of government \n(including  river  basin  commission),  i.e.,  who  decides  which  structural  and \nnonstructural measures will be implemented, and what is the basis of these \ndecisions; \n(v)  links,  interrelationships,  and  consistency  between  all  levels  of  local \ngovernments regarding flood and floodplain management; ", "12  Appendix 3 \n(vi)  the occurrence, consequences, and response to the last major flood(s) in the \nprovinces, including deaths, area flooded, damage, and affected houses; the \nsuccess or otherwise of existing structural controls; the success or otherwise of \nall aspects of the flood emergency management system (data acquisition, flood \nforecasting,  flood  warning,  together  with  defence,  evacuation,  relief,  and \nrecovery  activities);  the  responses  will  be  reviewed  through  all  levels  of \ngovernment: provincial, municipal, county, and township; \n(vii)  the  identification  of  institutional,  administrative,  economic,  and  technical \nconstraints to better flood management at all levels of government, i.e., what \ncan be done to improve the existing system; \n(viii)  outputs  will  include  (a)  a  comprehensive  report  describing  the  current \ninstitutional, legal, economic and technical bases of flood management in the \nPRC, including strengths and shortcomings; (b) identification of management \nconstraints and other barriers to better and more effective flood management, \nespecially in relation to the implementation of an integrated flood and floodplain \nmanagement process in the PRC; and (c) a final form of the principal guiding \nconceptual framework. \n \n7.  Activity Three: An Action Plan. A plan will be formulated to remove these constraints \nand barriers. Elements of this action plan might include \n \n(i)  the  need  to  review  flood  and  floodplain  management  arrangements  in  other \nprovinces; \n(ii)  modifications to existing legislation; \n(iii)  modifications to institutional arrangements and roles and responsibilities; \n(iv)  training and capacity building, at all levels of government, especially at lower \nlevels; and \n(v)  the adoption of new technology and management concept. \n \n8.  Activity  Four:  Dissemination  of  Findings.  Findings  will  be  disseminated  mainly \nthrough publications and brochures. The consultants will prepare a short brochure at each \nmilestone, summarizing important findings, analysis, and recommendations. The brochure will \nbe  widely  circulated  among  the  government  organizations,  nongovernment  organizations, \nacademia, and the public for information. The brochure will be posted on a web site, and \nregularly updated throughout the TA period. The final output of the TA is a handbook, including \nthe critical assessments of constraints, conceptual framework for an integrated management \napproach, and action plans. The handbook will be published and distributed to the provincial-\nlevel government offices. \n \nC.  Consultants Experts Requirements  \n \n9.  The TA will be carried out over 12 calendar months starting in September 2004 and \nending in September 2005. A total of 36 person-months of consulting services will be required \nfor  the  TA\u20147  for  international  and  29  for  domestic  consultants.  International  expertise  is \nrequired in flood and water resource management (5 months), institutional development (1 \nmonth), and land use planning and policy (1 month). Domestic experts required are for water \nresources  and  environmental  analysis  (10  months),  flood  risk  management  (8  months), \nemergency planning (3 months), resettlement and socioeconomic analysis (3 months), and legal \nand  institutional  analysis  (5  months).  The  tasks  will  require  consultants  substantially \nexperienced with flood management procedures; flood control measures; practices in flood \nprone  areas  in  various  reaches;  and  nonstructural  options  such  as  policy,  planning,  legal ", "Appendix 3  13 \nsystems, and institutional management. The international consultants must have had extensive \nexperience in broad policy, institutional, and management matters. They should also have \ndemonstrated good advisory skills in water resource management and at least 20 years of \nrelevant experience. Prior experiences in the PRC or developing countries is desirable.  The \ndomestic consultants must have had extensive experience in various PRC provinces with flood \ncontrol works (at least 15 years working in relevant fields), and good spoken English and writing \nskills are essential.  \n \nD.  Workshop and Reporting Requirements \n \n10.  The consultants will submit three reports. At the end of the first month, the consultants \nwill submit the inception report to the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nreport will be discussed at the first tripartite review meeting. The interim report will be submitted \nto the Government and ADB at the end of the 6 months from the start of the TA, and discussed \nin  the  second  tripartite  review  meeting.  The  draft  final  report  will  be  submitted  to  the \nGovernment and ADB 1 month before the end of the assignment, which will be presented by the \nconsultant in a final workshop. The third tripartite review meeting will be held prior to the \nconclusion of the TA to discuss the draft final report. The suggestions and comments generated \nduring the final workshop and the third tripartite review meeting will be incorporated into the TA \nfinal report, to be submitted to the Government and ADB at the end of the 12\u2013month TA \nimplementation period. The final report will include the handbook, so that MWR print sufficient \ncopies  for  distribution  to  the  provincial-level  government  offices.  At  TA  completion,  the \nconsultants will provide to MWR 15 copies in Chinese and 5 copies in English, of each of the \ninception and interim reports; and 40 copies in Chinese and 10 copies in English, of the final \nreport. ADB will require 5 copies of the inception and interim report and 10 copies of the final \nreport, in English. \n \n11.  The consultants will also prepare brief monthly progress notes for review by MWR\u2019s \ndepartment director, and ADB. Copies of the notes will also be provided in adequate quantities \nto the technical panel, and a contact person appointed in each relevant institution at the request \nof the technical panel. The notes, which should not exceed three pages, are intended to keep \nMWR, ADB, and the technical panel regularly informed of progress achieved, person-months \nused, key persons contacted, data collected, outputs produced, and constraints impeding data \ncollection or smooth TA implementation. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20040422162747+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20040422143341+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R65-04", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
