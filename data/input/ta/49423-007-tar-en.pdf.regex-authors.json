POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nTargeting classification: General Intervention (GI) \nA. Links to the National Poverty Reduction & Inclusive Growth Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe development policy framework of the Government of Bangladesh envisages sustainable development and \nmoving towards a middle-income threshold by year 2021.a The per capita electricity consumption in Bangladesh is \nonly 371 kilowatt-hours (kWh) (2015), lower than its neighboring countries. b Electricity consumption is projected to \ngrow at an annual rate of 11% during 2018\u20132020 and 6% during 2021\u20132030.c The demand for electricity has been \nrising rapidly with the growth in per capita income, increasing industrialization and the expansion of the agriculture \nand commercial sectors. Despite 91% of the population having access to electricity as of fiscal year (FY) 2018, \ninadequate supply of electricity remains a primary constraint on economic growth and poverty reduction in \nBangladesh. Recognizing the need to further industrialize and raise the living standards of the people, the \nGovernment of Bangladesh has set a goal of providing electricity to all by 2021, and to scale up the transmission \nand distribution network to cater to an expected power demand of more than 30,000 MW by 2030.  \nThe development policies of the government and particularly its energy policies are consistent with the country \npartnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for Bangladesh, which focuses on addressing major constraints for sustaining \neconomic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, good governance and capacity development, and regional \ncooperation.  It also  emphasizes on  easing  infrastructure  constraints  through  transformational investments, \nimproving human capital through skills development, promoting economic corridor development, improving rural \nlivelihoods and providing climate and disaster resilient infrastructure. In addition, promoting gender equality and \nimproving private sector participation and improving governance are key cross-cutting priorities. \nIn the energy sector, the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be extended to strengthening the \ntransmission and distribution infrastructure and enhancing access to power to meet the national target of increasing \na ccess to electricity of households, from 76% in 2017 to 100% by 2021. \nThe Bangladesh Power System Enhancement and Efficiency Improvement Project d and additional financing are \nin line with the national and sector needs and priorities of the government and the country partnership strategy for \nBangladesh. It will enhance the reliability and efficiency of the transmission and distribution network for better \nutilization  of expanding  power  generation capacity  to meet  the  growth in electricity  demand.  The  project \ncomponents include support for the transmission system development in southern Bangladesh, distribution system \nrehabilitation,  expansion  and  rural  electrification,  and  technical  support  for  a  variety  of  studies  including \ndevelopment of projects from renewable energy sources, energy efficiency improvements, and enhancement of \nregulatory initiatives. \nB. Results from the Poverty and Social Analysis during Due Diligence \n1.  Key poverty and social issues. In Bangladesh, the population living below the national poverty line was 24.3% \nin 2017; with 14.8% of the population having purchasing power parity below $1.90 a day.e Middle-income \nhouseholds comprise another 15% to 25% across the subproject areas and 25% of households in the upper income \ncategories. The average landholding size is estimated at 0.98 acres, which is hardly sufficient for the sustenance \nof large families. he monthly incomes of 72.6% of the households in subproject areas are less than Tk20,000 and \nof them, 25% have monthly incomes of less than Tk10,000. The rate of unemployment ranges from 10% to 30% \nacross subproject impact areas, largely due to comparatively low educational levels, lack of employable skills, \nrestricted mobility due to inadequate transport services, and lack of employment opportunities in the regions. Most \nof the unemployed people find work in seasonal agricultural activities or in daily paid casual labor work or else as \nsharecroppers to support their families. A fair number of children also work in various factories to find extra incomes \nfor their families despite child labor being illegal. Most of the women are housewives but they would engage in \nagriculture, livestock farming, tailoring and manufacture of handicrafts to earn a supplementary income for their \nfamilies. The ADB Country Partnership Strategy indicates that women have lower rate of labor force participation, \nhigher unemployment rates and have limited access to technical and vocational training (27.43% of students are \nfemale) \n2.  Beneficiaries. The first component for transmission will support an increase of low-cost base load power to the \nnational grid of Bangladesh and improve reliability of power in south and central Bangladesh including Dhaka. The \nsecond project component involving service improvement in parts of Dhaka and reducing customer outages will \n ", "  Appendix 1  9 \nbenefit over 700,000 customers (2015) served by the Dhaka Electric Supply Company. The third project component \nof distribution system rehabilitation, augmentation and rural electrification in Bangladesh Rural Electricity Board \n(BREB) service areas will benefit a significant cross section of electricity consumers and the rural households \nserved by BREB through its network of 77 palli bidyut samitis (PBS or rural cooperatives). It is estimated that \nexpansion of the rural electrification schemes will enable connecting more than 950,000 new consumers and \nenhance capacity to existing consumers. The fourth component will benefit several power sector agencies to \nenhance their institutional capacities and efficiency of service delivery including on areas such as efficiency \nimprovement of utilities and tariff setting. The additional finance will improve distribution systems for existing \ncustomers in the Khulna district through rehabilitation works. \n3.  Impact channels. The new power generation, improved quality and reliability and the expansion of the power \nsupply in rural areas will help to reduce domestic demand for kerosene and petroleum from international markets. \nThe proposed project will indirectly enhance the quality of life and health of the population of Bangladesh. The \nhouseholds connected to electricity will benefit from cost savings on energy and increased convenience in their \nhousehold chores, economic activities, and studies, and will promote the use of energy-based technologies for \neconomic activities, education, and entertainment. The farmers who suffer from crop losses due to poor and costly \nirrigation systems will use electricity for irrigation to reduce production costs and crop losses, and for mechanization \nof traditional modes of production. The increased capacity and efficiency of the transmission network, including the \ndistribution improvements will underpin national economic growth and community prosperity and eventually reduce \npoverty. \n4.  Other social and poverty issues. In the informal sector of the subproject impact areas, daily wages paid to \nwomen who engage in casual labor work are lower than the wages paid to men although there is not much \ndifference in the workload that both groups carry out. Excess of the labor available and social attitudes towards \nwomen are reported as factors that influence the lower wages for women. The access to educational and \nemployment opportunities is restricted due to household poverty, socio-cultural barriers, and limited transport \nfacilities. Opportunities for acquiring technical and vocational skills are rather remote in the villages and accessing \nsuch training in urban areas is unaffordable to many families due to financial difficulties and lack of transport \nfacilities. The facilities available in such places in terms of qualified medical and nursing personnel and medicine \nare in poor conditions. Awareness on HIV/AIDS is rather limited in most of the communities in the subproject impact \nareas except for a few people who gained some awareness through television and other media. \n5.  Design features. The project, including the additional finance is classified as a general intervention and is \nexpected to have a positive impact on peoples accessing energy through improved and reliable transmission and \ndistribution systems. No irreversible critical or adverse impacts were identified. The project will improve the overall \nenergy supply and development of the country. The project will develop a strategy to avoid or minimize negative \nimpacts on people and vulnerable groups directly or indirectly affected through appropriate management and \nmitigation measures including payment of adequate compensation for loss of land, structures, crops, and trees as \napplicable. \nII.  PARTICIPATION AND EMPOWERING THE POOR \n1.  Participatory approaches and project activities. Public consultations at 21 locations with the participation of \n285 men and women and their community-based organizations, and gender focused consultations at 19 locations \nwith 233 women in the project impact areas were conducted during the preparation of the resettlement plan and for \ndisclosing  information  about  the  proposed  project  and eliciting  their  views  and concerns.  Feedback  from \nconsultations was fed into the project design and implementation procedures. The process of consultation and \ninformation sharing will continue throughout project implementation. \n2.  Civil  society  organizations.  Consultations  will  continue  with  all  stakeholders,  including  civil  society \norganizations, during project implementation. The transmission component will hire the services of a non-\ngovernmental organization to implement the resettlement plan. The rural electrification component will be \nimplemented by BREB and the PBSs. The PBSs are partners in the project implementation. In addition, the \nactivities under the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction regarding the distribution and capacity building will involve \ncommunity-based user groups in project implementation. \n3.  The following forms of civil society organization participation are envisaged during project implementation, \nrated as high (H), medium (M), low (L), or not applicable (NA): \n \nH  Information gathering and sharing  H Consultation  H Collaboration  H Partnership \n4.  Participation Plan. This is as identified in the resettlement plan where continued participation during project. \nIII. GENDER AND DEVELOPMENT \nGender mainstreaming category: Effective Gender Mainstreaming \nimplementation would be carried out. \uf053 Yes     No \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \nA. Key issues: Gender inequality is a major social issue that limits the life options of women in Bangladesh. Women \nconstituted about 50% of the population in the 2011 census. Bangladesh was placed at a gender inequality index \nof 0.542 in 2017 and a ranking of 134 out of 160 countries reflecting high gender inequality with respect to \nreproductive health, empowerment (political participation and education), and labor market participation. In 2017, \nthe labor force participation rate was 33% for females and 79.8% for males.f Estimated per capita incomes in 2017 \naveraged $2,041, for women and $5,285 for men.g The link between gender inequality and energy supply has been \ncited. \nOverall, the energy sector is dominated by men, with energy industries employing very few women (about 2,000 \ncompared to 70,000 men). Moreover, because women are primarily expected to do household chores, they supply \nhuman energy to pump water and collect fuel for cooking in the absence of a domestic energy supply, resulting in \ndiminished or lost opportunities for education, income earning, and leisure. The project outputs are designed to \ndeliver tangible benefits to women by directly improving their access to social services, economic or financial \nresources or opportunities, and/or basic rural infrastructures. The associated technical assistance, funded by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction, will specifically focus on addressing the gender issues in the PBSs including \nthrough (i) developing model energy-based livelihoods with a focus on women\u2019s microenterprises development,    \n(ii) providing end-user education for the safe and efficient use of energy,(iii) improving the environment in the rural \nelectricity cooperative for women employees and subsidized customers, and (iv) providing technical and skills \ntraining, including in geographic information systems, to enable women to capture employment and livelihood \nopportunities in emerging areas. \nB. Key actions. A gender action plan (GAP) has been prepared to support on rural electrification related \ninterventions and would be implemented along with support from the $2.0 million Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \nPerformance targets and indicators have been matched to outputs and indicated in the GAP. The BREB PMU will \noversee implementation of the GAP. \n  \uf053 Gender action plan   \uf0a3 Other actions or measures     \uf0a3No action or measure \nIV. ADDRESSING SOCIAL SAFEGUARD ISSUES \nA.

Key impacts: The project and the additional financing will not involve any land acquisition or physical \ndisplacement of the population. However, temporary economic displacements are anticipated. The resettlement \nimpacts of the project are exclusively confined to the transmission system development component, which will \ninclude temporary loss of crops cultivated in an area of about 562 hectares of private land, loss of an estimated \n4,661 standing and commercial trees with an average of 27 trees per acre, and disturbance of 0.17 hectare of land \nby the erection of transmission towers and stringing of transmission lines. As a result, a maximum of 2,180 \nhouseholds might be temporarily affected, but the overall impact of the losses on households\u2019 economy and living \nstandards will be marginal. None of the other three project components will have significant resettlement impacts. \nImpacts associated with the additional finance relate to refurbishment of distribution poles and lines are minor and \nlimited to potential temporary economic displacement during civil works; and any such impacts will be confirmed \nthrough due diligence activities.   \n2.  Strategy to address the impacts: A resettlement plan has been prepared with an entitlement matrix and \nresettlement budget to provide compensation for the affected persons at replacement cost. For the additional \nfinance, due diligence will be undertaken, and the result will be incorporated in the resettlement plan if needed. \n3.
