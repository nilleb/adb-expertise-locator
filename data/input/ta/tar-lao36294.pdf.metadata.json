The Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) has requested \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the northern \nregion strategic action plan (NSAP).  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2002 TA program for Lao \nPDR.  ADB\u2019s  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Lao  PDR  in  September  2002  and  reached  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, terms of reference, financing, and \nimplementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.1  The  Mission  also  discussed  the  TA  with  key \ndevelopment partners active in Lao PDR. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over the last decade, the country overall has achieved stable economic growth and \npoverty reduction. According to the latest analysis, poverty has declined from 45% in 1992/93 to \n39% in 1997/98 in Lao PDR, thanks to the economic growth of about 5.5% per annum during \nthis period.2 Building on this achievement, the Government has set an ambitious target of \ngraduating from being a least developed country by 2020. However, the development progress \nhas been largely taken place in the urban centers and the lowland communities in the Mekong \nriver basin, and the interregional and rural-urban disparity in socioeconomic development has \nbeen  growing.  To  achieve  the  Government\u2019s  development  targets,  the  country  should \naccelerate sustainable economic development through broadening development opportunities in \nremote and isolated areas, particularly in the northern region.3  \n \n3.  The northern region has not achieved a satisfactory level of integration with the other \nregions  in  Lao  PDR  and  has  not  proportionately  benefited  from  the  country\u2019s  recent \ndevelopment. Poverty incidence (52.5%) in the northern region is much higher than in the \ncentral  (34.9%)  and  southern  (38.4%)  regions.  Much  of  investment  and  infrastructure \ndevelopment has been in the central and southern regions over the past decades and physical \nand social infrastructure development in the northern region is currently far behind. Mountainous \nterrain, remote settlements, and low population density have been serious barriers to access to \nsocial services and viable economic opportunities. The fiscal situation of most provinces in the \nnorthern region is budget deficit. Diverse ethnic groups with different languages and cultures, \nshifting  cultivation,  and  opium  production  in  the  northern  region  require  a  well-designed \ninnovative  approach,  which  may  be  different  from  conventionally  prescribed  development \nmodels.  \n \n4.  The northern region has a reasonable variety of natural resources with potential for \ndevelopment,  including  specialized  commercial  agriculture  (i.e.,  organic  farming,  herbs, \nnontimber forest products, and livestock), commercial tree plantation, ecotourism, mining, and \nhydropower.  The  importance  of  developing  the  northern  region  has  been  increasingly \nrecognized in the recent years, and various development activities are currently ongoing and \nplanned to address the constraints and to tap the region\u2019s potential. Several key national and \nsubregional ongoing and planned infrastructure projects, including road improvement and power \ntransmission  and  distribution,  are  expected  to  relieve  major  physical  blockage  and  open \ndevelopment in the northern region. In particular, the proposed Greater Mekong Subregion \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internal version) on 10 June 2002. \n2  In 2000, an participatory poverty assessment was jointly conducted by ADB, World Bank, and the Government to \nidentify main roots of poverty. To effectively reduce poverty, ADB and the Government signed a poverty reduction \npartnership agreement in September 2001. \n3 Under this TA, the northern region includes Bokeo, Houaphanh, Louang Namtha, Louang Phrabang, Oudomxay, \nPhongsaly, Xayabury, Xieng Khouang provinces and Xaisomboun Special Zone. ", "2 \n(GMS): northern economic corridor project linking Louang Namtha and Bokeo provinces with \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  and  Thailand  will  provide  the  remote  and  isolated  areas  with \nopportunities  to  access  larger  markets.  These  initiatives  should  be  fully  reflected  in  and \nstrategically  integrated  with  other  development  activities  in  various  sectors  in  the  northern \nregion, in order to maximize development impact.   \n \n5.  The  Government  is  increasingly  devolving  its  development  planning  function  to  the \nprovinces in the context of the recent decentralization policy.  However, the current institutional \nframework and provincial capacity is not adequate to coordinate with other neighboring province \nplans,  national  strategies,  and  the  subregional  cooperation  framework.  In  addition,  much \nremains to be learned about the role of the public sector in a market economy. In 1995, the \nState  Planning  Committee  (now  Committee  for  Planning  and  Cooperation  [CPC])  initiated \ndrafting regional plans, which were not finalized and officially adopted. These were prepared \nlargely in the central planning paradigm and were not backed by a financing plan linked to \nbudgets and external resource availability. The Government and provinces now want to develop \nstrategic  action  plans  for  northern,  central,  and  southern  regions  in  a  more  participatory \napproach, in order to (i) facilitate implementation of the national development agenda in different \nregional  circumstances;  (ii)  integrate  among  various  line  ministries\u2019  sectoral  strategies  and \neffectively coordinate among neighboring provincial plans/strategies; (iii) enhance effectiveness \nof key investment through a prioritization process, given the resource constraints; and (iv) \nappropriately reflect private sector perspectives and public preferences in the planning process. \nThe  Government  plans  to  start  from  the  northern  region,  which  has  the  highest  poverty \nincidence. If a NSAP is successfully prepared and implemented, the Government will adopt a \nsimilar approach in the central and southern regions. The northern region plan will be a good \nopportunity for CPC and provincial staff to improve their understanding of advanced planning \nprocesses and establish good practices for other development plans.  \n \n6.  ADB has had a significant role in assisting the Government to strengthen its economic \nand financial management function. In particular, ADB has been involved in strengthening the \npublic  investment  programming  and  aid  monitoring  functions,  improving  public  expenditure \nmanagement,  and  strengthening  participatory  poverty  monitoring  and  evaluation.  ADB \noperations  will  primarily  focus  on  the  northern  region.  The  United  Nations  Development \nProgramme has been involved in participatory development planning at the provincial and \ndistrict  levels.  The  Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency  is  considering \nproviding assistance for upland planning in Louang Phrabang and Oudomxay provinces. The \nEuropean Union and several bilateral aid agencies including from Australia, Germany, Sweden, \nand United States, have been involved in developing selected provinces in the northern region. \nThe TA will build on the achievements of ADB and other development partners and will closely \ncoordinate with other ongoing and planned activities in the northern region to enhance synergic \neffect.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The TA will assist the Government to (i) prepare a NSAP, aiming at better balanced and \nbroad-based development; (ii) establish best practices for regional planning through effectively \ncoordinating central agencies, line ministries, provinces, the private sector, and communities; \nand (iii) strengthen the capacity within the Government and provinces in conducting effective \nregional development planning.  \n ", "    3 \n8.  The NSAP will include a strategic vision up to 2020, a plan of action up to 2010, a list of \nkey priority development activities (including brief project profiles) up to 2010 with groups of \n2004\u20132005 and 2006\u20132010, an indicative financing plan, and a monitoring mechanism. It will \nemphasize  key  opportunities  for  investment  activities,  policy  reforms,  and  institutional \nimprovement that are necessary to address constraints, realize development potential, and \nimprove  living  standards  in  the  northern  region.  It  will  identify  and  prepare  key  proposals \nsuitable for internal and external financing. In particular, the NSAP will have a major bearing on \nthe  public  investment  program  (PIP)  and  possibly  ADB\u2019s  future  lending  and  nonlending \nprogram. The areas identified for private sector activity will be available for the Government to \ndisseminate to and discuss with potential private investors through the internet, business fora, \nand chambers of commerce of relevant countries. Lao PDR is currently finalizing its national \npoverty eradication program, which will be considered as the poverty reduction strategy paper. \nThe NSAP will assist in implementing the national poverty eradication program and its strategy \nfor transition to modernization and industrialization.  \n \n9.  Key  TA  outputs,  in  addition  to  the  NSAP,  will  include  (i)  the  improved  institutional \nframework, and strengthened capacity of CPC and northern region provinces for coordinating \nand planning; and (ii) lessons learned from other regional countries\u2019 development planning \nexperiences, and improved cooperation with other planning institutes in the region.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The NSAP will be developed by (i) analyzing the major constraints of development in the \nnorthern region and developing a strategic approach to efficiently address them; (ii) identifying \ndevelopment potentials and competitiveness in the northern region, in consideration of the \nnational development strategy and the subregional cooperation framework; (iii) assessing the \nexisting socioeconomic development strategy; provincial plans; sector development strategies, \nincluding  agriculture,  roads,  power,  education,  health,  water  supply,  tourism,  urban \ndevelopment,  rural  finance,  and  industry;  and  studies  on  poverty,  ethnic  diversity,  gender, \nenvironment, opium production, unexploded ordnance, and private sector; and integrating their \nkey elements with development of the  northern region; (iv) assessing the current policy and \ninstitutional framework, including the decentralization process, and  identifying the changes and \nreforms  necessary  to  realize  the  potential  of  the  northern  region,  particularly  for  enabling \nappropriate and sustainable private sector activities; (v) assessing the ongoing and planned \ndevelopment activities of public and private sectors in the northern region, and identifying \nadditional  key  investments  necessary  to  optimize  development  impact;  (vi)  preparing  an \nindicative financing plan to implement these investments through the PIP and medium-term \nexpenditure framework, development partners\u2019 programs, and private sector participation; and \n(vii)  conducting  extensive  consultations  with  Government,  civil  society    and  development \npartners, and incorporating public preferences.   \n \n11.  The Government and provinces\u2019 planning capacity will be built by full participation in \npreparing the NSAP. The Government and concerned provinces will assign senior staff, who will \nparticipate in the planning process as their representatives and be trained as trainers. CPC is \ncurrently  conducting  a  needs  assessment  for  capacity  building  (particularly  in  planning \nmethodology) and drafting a capacity building plan so that international consultants can develop \nand implement it in a timely manner. To enhance understanding of the roles and responsibilities \nof the Government and provinces in market economy, and to improve the planning system and \nframework, and learn lessons from other countries\u2019 experience, a high level workshop will be \nheld with the invitation of international planning experts including eminent persons from relevant \nregional countries. The TA will also support establishing cooperation networks with regional ", "4 \nplanning agencies or research institutes that have successfully prepared and implemented \nmarket-based regional development plans. English language training will be provided to CPC \nstaff, who will be selected in consultation with ADB, to facilitate access to advanced knowledge \nand information on planning produced in English. Progress on training will be evaluated and \nmonitored.  Necessary  equipment  and  facilities  including  a  vehicle,  computer  hardware, \nsoftware, materials, and books will be provided to facilitate implementation of the TA. \n \n12.  The TA is tentatively scheduled to be implemented in 17 months, from November 2002 \nto March 2004, in three stages with intervals for review and consultations. During stage one \n(late November 2002\u2013late March 2003), a first draft of the NSAP, comprising a draft strategic \nvision 2020, a draft plan of action up to 2010, and an initial list of key development activities for \n2003\u20132010, will be jointly prepared by the Government senior project team and consultants. \nThe  draft  will  be  based  on  a  resource  inventory  and  evaluation,  extensive  field  visits, \nassessment of development potential, and consultations with stakeholders and development \npartners.  It  will  include  a  digest  and  integration  of  existing  plans,  sectoral  strategies,  and \nstudies;  presentation  of  alternative  regional  development  strategies;  indication  of  possible \ninvestment activities for further review in stage two; and a work plan for stages two and three. \nThe first draft NSAP will be internally and/or externally further discussed and reviewed by the \nGovernment, concerned provinces, ADB, and other development partners during late March \n2003\u2013late  May  2003.  Following  review  and  consultations,  the  senior  project  team  and \nconsultants will be guided to finalize the strategic vision 2020 and given clearance to commence \nstage two (June\u2013August 2003). The second draft will be prepared during stage two through \nfurther identifying, reviewing, and prioritizing key development activities for 2003\u20132010 and \nspecific reform agenda. A draft indicative financing plan and a monitoring mechanism will also \nbe developed. The NSAP will be finalized during stage three (November\u2013December 2003), for \napproval  of  the  Prime  Minister,  reflecting  comments  from  stakeholders  and  development \npartners. TA implementation will be fully coordinated with the Government\u2019s annual planning \nand PIP cycle.  \n \n13.  Major risks are that the NSAP (i) will be produced by international consultants without \nsignificant capacity being built, and (ii) will not be fully implemented after it is prepared. To \nminimize these risks, it is critical to ensure the Government\u2019s and provinces\u2019 strong ownership of \nthe NSAP and their commitment to implementing it. The primary responsibility for preparing the \nNSAP should lie with CPC, relevant line ministries, and northern provincial authorities. The \nGovernment and concerned provinces will establish a senior TA team led by a vice president \n(planning) of CPC to fully participate in preparing the plan. This will help enhance CPC\u2019s and \nprovinces\u2019 ownership of the plan and build capacity within the Government and concerned \nprovinces so as to sustain the initiative to prepare regional development plans. Consultation \nwith development partners and relevant stakeholders will be a feature of the TA. To reflect \npublic preferences, provincial workshops will be held in each northern province. ADB staff will \ncarry out policy dialogue and closely monitor overall implementation over the course of the TA, \nto ensure participation and ownership of the Government and concerned provinces.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $825,000 equivalent, comprising $590,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $235,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance \n$700,000, comprising the foreign exchange cost and $110,000 equivalent of the local currency \ncost,  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  finance  the \nremaining $125,000, in kind by providing office accommodation and utilities, counterpart staff, ", "    5 \ntraining and workshop facilities, and other related services and facilities. The details of cost \nestimates and financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements. \n15.  The Government, through CPC, will take the lead role in preparing the NSAP and related \nactivities.  CPC  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  deputy  prime  minister  and \npresident  of  CPC  will  oversee  the  overall  TA  implementation.  He  will  hold  meetings  with \nnorthern region provincial governors to discuss the NSAP drafts. The vice president (planning) \nof CPC will lead a senior TA team, comprising directors general or senior staff of the Planning \nDepartment, PIP Department, National Economic Research Institute, National Statistics Center, \nand Ministry of Finance (MOF), and key senior staff from relevant line ministries and provinces. \nThe senior TA team will provide inputs, coordinate the TA activities, monitor its progress, \nresolve  any  difficulties  that  may  arise  during  implementation,  and  review  the  TA  outputs \nincluding the draft NSAP. The director general of the Planning Department, CPC, will be the \nnational TA director and will oversee day-to-day activities of the TA and liaise with the senior TA \nteam members, consultants, and ADB to ensure smooth implementation. CPC will provide five \nappropriately qualified full-time counterpart staff, including two from the Planning Department \nand one each from the PIP Department, National Economic Research Institute, and National \nStatistics Center to work with the consultants for the duration of the TA. Each northern province \nwill take immediate action to set up a provincial chamber of commerce, where one does not \nalready  exist.  The  Government  will  make  available  any  reports,  statistical  data,  and  other \ninformation  of  relevance,  and  assist  in  obtaining  information  from  other  ministries  and \nGovernment agencies.  \n \n16.   Three  international consultants will be engaged, on an individual basis, in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, for a total of 19 person-months: a regional \nplanner  (team  leader)  with  expertise  in  public  finance  (8  person-months),  a  multisectoral \neconomist with experience in agriculture and rural development and social sectors (7 person-\nmonths), and a private sector developer (4 person-months). Two domestic consultants will be \nengaged,  on  an  individual  basis,  in  accordance  with  the  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants,  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants, for a total of 15 person-months: a participatory planning facilitator (9 person-months), \nand an infrastructure planning specialist (6 person-months). The consultants will undertake the \nassignments intermittently. The team leader will prepare a detailed work plan in consultation with \nother consultants before TA implementation. An inception report will be submitted within 30 days \nafter commencement of the TA in addition to drafts of the NSAP (para 12). The team leader will \nprepare a capacity building action plan in consultation with CPC. The outline terms of reference \nare presented in Appendix 3 and a proposed outline for the NSAP is in Appendix 4. Equipment \nrequired under the TA will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines \nfor procurement. On completion of the TA, the equipment will be turned over to the Government, \nwhich will ensure it will be available for any ensuing ADB-funded TAs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.
