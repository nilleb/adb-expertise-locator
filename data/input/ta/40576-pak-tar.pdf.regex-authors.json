During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  for  the  proposed  Transmission  Enhancement \nInvestment Program, the Government of Pakistan requested technical assistance (TA) from \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to assist in establishing and commencing operations of the \nCentral Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). Approval from the Vice President on the concept \npaper  was  given  on  15  September  2006.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Pakistan  in \nSeptember 2006 to formulate the TA. The Government gave its concurrence with the impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference of the consultants. The TA framework appears in Appendix 1.1\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s  power  sector  is  experiencing  tremendous  challenges  in  supporting  the \nGovernment\u2019s strategy to increase electricity supply to its urban and rural population. Nearly \n45% of the population does not have access to electricity. The power sector, a key infrastructure \nprovider, will need to increase its capacity to sustain higher economic growth targets expressed \nin  the  Medium  Term  Development  Framework  2005\u20132010,  and  thereby  to  assist  in \nimplementing the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. The key challenges are (i) lack of \ngeneration capacity, (ii) constraints in the transmission and distribution systems, (iii) financial \nmanagement  and  sustainability  of  sector  entities,  and  (iv)  instituting  proper  corporate \ngovernance structures for the successor companies of the Water and Power Development \nAuthority (WAPDA).2\n \n3.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  of  Pakistan  (the  Government)  has \napproved  power  sector  policies  and  strategies  and  it  has  instituted  action  plans.  The \nGovernment started the unbundling of the power sector in 1998. The National Transmission and \nDespatch Company (NTDC) was established the following year with a mandate to provide \n(i) transmission  of  electricity  through  the  220-kilovolt  and  500-kilovolt  network,  (ii)  system \noperation and dispatch functions for all power generation linked to the national grid, and (iii) the \nsingle purchase and seller functions of the power sector. To further realize the efficiencies and \nother benefits from restructuring and unbundling, the Government has decided to separate the \nlast function from NTDC and create an autonomous body. This is in line with advice from ADB, \nwhich was further reinforced by the recommendations of ADB\u2019s capacity building technical \nassistance for NTDC.3 The TA undertook an analysis of the single-buyer model and drafted the \nnecessary agreements. The single buyer is defined as the purchaser of all wholesale electricity \nrequirements from all available generators on behalf of the consumers and the seller under a \nbulk supply tariff to all consumers (distribution companies and large customers). Although the \nfinancial accounts have been integrated as part of NTDC\u2019s accounts, the CPPA function until \nrecently  was  administered  by  a  division  of  WAPDA,  which  is  WAPDA  Private  Power \nOrganization. The division has been operational since the independent power producers started \ngenerating power in accordance with the 1994 power policy. A part of the division is now \npreparing to become an autonomous entity, CPPA.  \n \n4.  According to Government plans, CPPA was scheduled to start its operations as an \nautonomous entity by the beginning of July 2006. The Government  has faced difficulty in \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 October 2006.  \n2  Eight distribution companies, four generation companies, and the National Transmission Despatch Company were \nestablished from the divisions and departments of WAPDA. \n3  ADB. 2003 Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for Institutional Capacity Building of National \nTransmission and Despatch Company Limited. Manila. \n ", "2   \nachieving this goal because of the complex nature of the entity that would act as the center of \ndemand and supply in the electricity market. The delay has added to uncertainty surrounding \nthe future structure of the sector.  \n \n5.  A long-term road map and action plan for the function to be taken on by CPPA is stated \nin NTDC\u2019s license and Transitional Order No. 1 (i.e., phase 1: single buyer, phase 2: single \nbuyer plus, phase 3: competitive wholesale market [competitive trading and bilateral contract \nmarket], and phase 4: retail competition). Before establishing CPPA, details are needed on the \ndistribution of functions for power trading, organizational and financial structure of CPPA, and \naction plan to realize the long-term road map. The financial viability and credibility of CPPA is \nespecially important for the private sector power producers, since CPPA is intended to be the \ncounterpart to power purchase agreements.  \n \n6.  The single-buyer function has contributed most of NTDC\u2019s losses. The generation tariffs \nalready have been adjusted to reach cost recovery but the consumer tariffs have lagged behind. \nThis  gap  is  accumulated  in  NTDC  accounts  as  losses.  The  outstanding  receivables  from \ndistribution  companies  have  also  burdened  NTDC\u2019s  financial  accounts.  The  financial \nattractiveness of the independent CPPA to the commercial participants will be dependent upon \n(i) how the current financial position of the single-buyer function will be resolved, (ii) its future \nfinancial viability, and (iii) its creditworthiness.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact would be for improved efficiency in the power sector to lower the cost of \nelectricity. The merit-order competition, further enhanced by CPPA, will foster the incentives and \nenvironment for power generators to actively seek cost efficiency in their operations and act to \nset benchmarks for the sector. The outcome is for a sustainable trading system in electricity to \nbe established and operate. Establishing CPPA and its commencing operations will be the first \nsteps toward the final goal of a multi-buyer and multi-seller trading system.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will have two phases. In the first phase, the consultants will build upon the work \nof the previous TA. Detailed diagnostics will be updated on the current situation and then the \nconsultants will map out a recommended distribution of roles and institutional structures for the \nvarious functions involved in electricity trading and settlement (the roles of CPPA and of the \ndispatcher, NTDC, as well as of other related entities will be clearly defined). The consultants \nwill do a stocktaking of the current state of readiness and produce the road map for CPPA\u2019s \nestablishment and operations as an autonomous entity.   \n \n9.  The  second  phase  of  the  TA  will  focus  on  establishing  CPPA  and  starting  up  its \noperations.  This  phase  will  have  four  subcomponents:  (i)  documentation,  (ii)  training,  (iii) \ncomputer system, and (iv) settlement mechanism. Since there is a trading system in place, the \nvarious documents necessary for establishment will be in different stages of development. The \nconsultants will start by analyzing the existing documents and procedures and suggest changes \nor redraft to enable CPPA to operate as an autonomous entity and to manage various forms of \ncommercial sector participation in the power sector. Regarding establishment, the consultants \nwill  assist  in  reviewing,  revising,  drafting,  and  finalizing,  as  required,  the  (i) necessary \nincorporation documents (including Articles of Association), (ii) business and financing plans, (iii) \n ", "  3\ncorporate and management plan (including the code of conduct for staff and management), (iv) \ncommercial  code  and  standard  agreements  with  the  market  participants  (including \nstrengthening of agreements with distribution companies, generation companies, independent \npower producers, Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, and WAPDA Hydel), (v) organization and \nmanagement structure, and (vi) trading standard procedures (i.e., demand and supply forecast, \ntariff application, procurement, risk management, and accounting). The consultants will give \ninitial  training  to  (i)  staff  on  trading  standard  procedures,  (ii)  trainers  in  order  to  educate \nparticipating institutions (generation companies, distribution companies, and independent power \nproducers) on dealing with CPPA, and (iii) staff with regard to educating the public.  \n \n10.  Trading computer system requirements will be analyzed and a system development plan \ndrafted that includes the principle software and hardware requirements for the first 5 years of \noperation. The detailed plan for the initial system will be based on analysis of the current system. \nThe TA will support the financing of necessary software and hardware.  \n \n11.  The  Contracts  Registrar  and  Power  Exchange  Administrator  is  the  market  and \nsettlement operator envisaged by the Government, but it is not yet established. In the initial \nstage,  this  function  is  intended  to  be  included  in  CPPA.  The  TA  will  analyze  the  current \nsettlement mechanism and recommend a system for this operation, including billing and cash \ntransfer.  \n \n12.  The financing plan will give special attention to addressing (i) a solution for existing \nreceivables and payment issues, (ii) creditworthiness of CPPA, and (iii) cross-subsidy issues \nbetween distribution companies. The corporate and management plan will address such issues \nas  corporate  governance,  conflicts  of  interest,  and  fiduciary  responsibilities  of  staff  and \nmanagement.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The estimated cost of the TA is $1,187,500 equivalent. The Government has asked ADB \nto  finance  $950,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment will provide $237,500 equivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and \nother expenditures (Appendix 2). \n \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Water and Power will be the Executing Agency for the TA, while the \nCPPA (initially as a part of NTDC and later as an independent agency) will be the Implementing \nAgency.  The  TA  will  engage  international  consultants  for  20  person-months  and  national \nconsultants for 20 person-months. The international consultants will have extensive experience \nin legal, trading, system, and settlement aspects of electricity trading. The national consultants \nwill have expertise in the power sector, computer systems as well as in legal and regulatory \nmatters. The first phase of the TA is expected to take 4 months and the second phase 12 \nmonths. The outline terms of reference and reporting arrangements are in Appendix 3. Tripartite \nmeetings involving CPPA and ADB will be held after submission of the inception, interim, and \ndraft final reports. A consulting firm or consortium of firms will be selected and engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging national consultants. Recruitment of consultants \nwill be done in accordance with quality- and cost-based selection procedures, and simplified \ntechnical proposals will be requested. The procurement of equipment under the TA will be \n ", "4   \nconducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The equipment and software will \nbe procured through shopping or Limited International Bidding. The TA will begin in December \n2006 and be completed by April 2008.  \n \nIV.
