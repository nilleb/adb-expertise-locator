Following the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis, finance ministers of the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations plus Japan, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Republic of Korea \n(ASEAN+3) established economic review and policy dialogue to discuss regularly and exchange \nviews  on  macroeconomic  developments  and  policy  issues  in  the  ASEAN+3  region  and \nindividual member countries. They requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  national  and  regional  institutions \ninvolved.  ADB  responded  with  a  three-pronged  capacity-building  effort:  (i)  supporting  the \nestablishment of national surveillance units (NSU) in selected ASEAN countries, (ii) providing \ntraining on regional economic and financial monitoring (REFM) at ADB headquarters for officers \nfrom finance ministries and central banks of selected ASEAN+3 countries1, (iii) strengthening \nthe capacity of the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta. The third activity has been successfully \nconcluded and the other two activities continue to be an important focus of ADB\u2019s support to \nstrengthen the capacity of ASEAN+3 countries to monitor their financial vulnerabilities. The first \nactivity  created  data  templates  for  economic  and  financial  indicators  in  each  NSU,  and \nenhanced local skills for preparing national surveillance reports used for internal policy making \nand discussion in regional meetings under the ASEAN+3 finance ministers process (FMP). A \nnew project to support REFM in selected ASEAN+3 countries was launched in January 2006 to \ncontinue the capacity building effort for NSU and similar government agencies.2 Under the \nsecond activity, 164 mid-level government officials from finance ministries and central banks of \nselected ASEAN+3 countries completed an REFM training course lasting an average of 4\u20135 \nweeks,  organized  biannually  at  ADB  headquarters  in  close  cooperation  with  the  ASEAN \nSecretariat. The effectiveness of these training programs3 is reflected in the enhanced capacity \nof  ASEAN+3  countries  to  prepare  effective  surveillance  reports  and  analysis  on  regional \neconomic and financial vulnerabilities discussed at the ASEAN+3 deputy finance ministers and \nministers meetings. This TA report reflects the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing \nplans,  and  implementation  arrangements  discussed  with  government  agencies  concerned \nduring the regional workshops and fact-finding missions.4 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Given the effectiveness of these programs, ADB was asked to continue and strengthen \nits support for technical training and capacity building on REFM by expanding the scope of \nassistance to (i) cover senior management staff of ASEAN+3 finance ministries and central \nbanks, and (ii) conduct related economic research work. Explicit requests were made at regional \nworkshops for ASEAN+3 officials organized at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia \n(April 2005); Manila, Philippines (November 2005); and Siam Reap, Cambodia (March 2006).5 \n                                                 \n1 Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Philippines, Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n2 ADB. 2006.

The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on \n12 July 2006. \n5 (i) Workshop on Quantitative Methods for Economic and Financial Monitoring and Strengthening of National \nSurveillance  Units  in  East  Asia,  jointly  organized  by  ADB-ASEAN  Secretariat-Ministry  of  Finance,  Jakarta, ", " 2   \nRequests  to  continue  and  strengthen  assistance  for  REFM  training  programs  were  also \nreceived during several missions of ADB\u2019s Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) to \nthe countries involved. As a relatively large number of ASEAN+3 officials have been trained \nunder the REFM training program, ADB was requested to introduce an advanced executive \ntraining program on policy-related issues for senior management officials of ASEAN+3 finance \nministries and central banks that are actively involved in (i) economic and financial monitoring, \nand  (ii)  vulnerability  assessment  and  economic  policy  formulation.  ASEAN+3  countries \nrequested ADB to conduct research and prepare specific studies to provide the technical and \nanalytical background necessary to conduct these training programs, especially the executive \ntraining for senior management staff.  \n \n3.  The  ASEAN+3  FMP  includes  several  initiatives  aimed  at  enhancing  domestic  and \nregional economic and financial cooperation efforts, including the Chiang Mai Initiative, Asian \nBond  Markets  Initiative,  Economic  Review  and  Policy  Dialogue,  and  Research  Group.  In \naddition, a Working Group on Economic and Financial Surveillance was created during the \nMay 2006 Meeting of the ASEAN+3 finance ministers in Hyderabad, India. These initiatives and \nthe new Working Group involve staff from finance ministries and central banks of the countries \nconcerned, although the finance ministries usually take the lead in designing, planning, and \nimplementing the process. \n \n4.  All these initiatives are related to regional economic surveillance. The REFM training \nprogram has been designed to support capacity building efforts in creating expertise among \nmid-level  ASEAN+3  officials  on  regional  economic  surveillance.  The  first  training  program \nstarted in 1999. Since then, similar training programs (from 3 weeks to 3 months in duration) \nhave been organized every 6 months. Currently, the course is structured into five modules \n(regional integration and cooperation, macroeconomic financial programming and economic \npolicy, assessment of financial vulnerabilities, early warning systems, and selected topics on \nsurveillance) over 5 weeks. Econometrics and statistics courses are also offered to strengthen \nthe technical background of the trainees, and selected economic topics are analyzed and \ndiscussed in detail with distinguished scholars. The course content is updated regularly through \nclose consultations with agencies involved and the ASEAN+3 Secretariat. About 12 trainees \nhave been registered in each of the 13 groups that have completed the course to date. A total of \n164 officials have graduated, a large percentage of whom continues to work for domestic public \ninstitutions  in  the  area  of  REFM.  Therefore,  an  extensive  network  of  alumni  has  been \nestablished among ASEAN+3 countries, which facilitates further regional networking and close \ncoordination with other domestic and regional projects funded by ADB. \n \n5.  As economic interdependence and financial cooperation among ASEAN+3 countries has \nbeen proceeding fast, the scope for dialogue and coordination has greatly increased among \ninstitutions across the region, such as finance ministries and central banks. Trainees that have \ncompleted the REFM course program at ADB have directly or indirectly supported this process. \nInteraction has been greatly facilitated among regional institutions, as individuals who attended \nthe course are now familiar with similar technical subjects and are able in the largest majority of \ncases to establish effective and close interpersonal relationships due also to the presence of a \nsupportive alumni network. The course has involved only mid-level officials but there is now \nscope for targeting senior managers on policy-related issues, as course graduates have moved \n                                                                                                                                                          \nIndonesia, 25\u201326 April 2005; (ii) Workshop on Operationalizing the Vulnerability Indicators and Early Warning \nSystem (VIEWS) Software for Economic and Financial Monitoring in East Asia: Sharing Experiences, ADB \nHeadquarters,  Manila,  Philippines,  18\u201319  November  2005;  and  (iii)  Workshop  on  Economic  and  Financial \nMonitoring in East Asia: The Way Ahead, jointly organized by ADB-ASEAN Secretariat-Ministry of Economy and \nFinance, Siam Reap, Cambodia, 5\u20136 March 2006. ", "    3 \nto higher positions within their institutions and can receive further training. To widen the scope \nof training and include a program for senior management staff, proper analytical deepening is \nrequired through specific research activity. Therefore, enhancing the training program would \nrequire conducting research on issues related to surveillance and macroeconomic policy options \nfor ASEAN+3 countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  This TA aims to enhance the capacity of officials from ministries of finance and central \nbanks of ASEAN+3 countries for (i) conducting effective economic and financial monitoring \nactivities, and (ii) providing relevant inputs for economic policy making through technical training \nprograms and related research activities. A first purpose of this TA is to train mid-level and \nsenior officials from finance ministries and central banks of selected ASEAN+3 countries on \nvarious issues related to economic and financial monitoring, from a domestic and regional \nperspective. In addition, given the need to retrain some of the officials who have undergone \ntraining in a previous phase of this project and to strengthen the analytical and technical \ncapacity of senior officials engaged with economic monitoring and policy making, a second \npurpose of this TA is to introduce an executive training program on economic policy-related \nissues for senior officials involved in national and regional economic surveillance and economic \npolicy  making.  Lastly,  given  the  importance  of  deepening  the  training  programs  and  their \ncontent, this TA will also involve the preparation of specific issue studies and related research. \n \n7.  The overall impact of the TA is on improving technical capacities of staff from national \neconomic and financial agencies in selected ASEAN+3 countries on monitoring activities. The \nTA outcome relates in particular to build capacities for finance ministries and central banks in \nREFM for mid-level officials and macroeconomic policy formulation for senior management staff. \nIn addition, the TA will support the preparation of research and analysis on regional economic \nsurveillance and macroeconomic policy options for ASEAN+3 countries. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  A 5-week technical course on REFM will involve about 60 mid-level officials from finance \nministries and central banks of selected ASEAN+3 countries (footnote 1). This course will focus \non  developing  the  capacity  to  assess  financial  vulnerabilities  and  conduct  economic  and \nfinancial analysis using early warning system (EWS) models. The course will be divided into five \nparts. Part I (about 1 week) will introduce the course and discuss surveillance issues in the \ncontext of the theory and practice of regional cooperation and integration. During this first week, \ntrainees  will  discuss  recent  economic  trends  in  their  countries.  Reviews  of  statistics  and \neconometrics are also offered to trainees. Part II will discuss issues related to macroeconomic \nfinancial programming and economic policies, with simulations of program scenarios. Part III will \ncover financial vulnerability assessment and leading indicators in detail. Part IV will introduce \nand analyze EWS models, including the Vulnerability Indicators and Early Warning Systems \n(VIEWS) model developed by OREI. Part V will discuss selected topics related to economic \nsurveillance, including global payments imbalances and issues related to monetary policies. \nADB staff and consultants will conduct the course. The mid-level officials who will attend this \ncourse will be selected from ASEAN+3 finance ministries and central banks and the ASEAN \nSecretariat. Participants are expected to have the following minimum qualifications: \n \n(i)  a bachelor\u2019s degree (or the equivalent) in economics, statistics, or finance from a \nrecognized university, and preferably a postgraduate qualification in the same field; ", " 4   \n(ii)  at least 5 years of relevant professional work experience, with a strong background \nin economic and statistical analysis;  \n(iii)  fluency in written and spoken English; and  \n(iv)  currently working in a department undertaking surveillance work. \n \n9.  The  executive  training  program  for  senior  management  staff  of  ASEAN+3  finance \nministries and central banks will analyze policy-related issues concerning REFM. The program \nwill focus on, but not be limited to, the following three issues: (i) assessment of domestic and \nregional financial vulnerabilities; (ii) formulation of monetary and exchange rate policies; and \n(iii) fiscal policies for stability and growth. The modules will be delivered at ADB headquarters or \nat  more  convenient  venues,  should  participants  be  required  to  attend  regional  meetings \nelsewhere. Each module may require the participation of different individuals from the same \ninstitution. About 20\u201325 individuals will participate in each module\u2014one from each institution \nconcerned. Each module will last for 2 days and will be tentatively structured as follows: (i) Day \n1 morning\u2014introduction of policy issues and research findings; (ii) Day 1 afternoon\u2014specific \ncase studies on ASEAN+3 countries; (iii) Day 2 morning\u2014issue-specific case studies; and (iv) \nDay 2 afternoon\u2014development of an analytical regional framework. ADB staff and consultants \nmay deliver each module of the program in partnership with relevant regional research centers.  \n \n10.  Research activities and analysis on regional economic surveillance and macroeconomic \npolicy formulation for ASEAN+3 countries will be done in close collaboration with the ASEAN+3 \nResearch  Group.  Research  activities  will  be  conducted  by  ADB  staff  and  international \nconsultants, depending on the research topic. The research outcome will be disseminated to \nASEAN+3 countries and the public, as appropriate. \n \n11.  The TA activities will expose trainees to economic and financial data systems; emerging \ndata standards; EWS and macroeconomic models; methods of policy analysis; how to achieve \nfinancial stability, and the implications of monetary, exchange rate, and fiscal policies. These \nactivities will help develop the technical skills and practical experience needed to sustain and \nsupport full understanding and ownership of issues related to REFM. Although participation in \nthis training program will be open to all ASEAN+3 countries, it is expected that some countries \nparticipate to a higher degree. The capacity to conduct economic and financial monitoring in \ncountries  such  as  Brunei  Darussalam, Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic,  and \nMyanmar\u2014and, to a lesser extent, the PRC and Viet Nam\u2014is still relatively weak. Thus, there \nmay be a large number of mid-level officials from these countries participating in the training \nprogram as they may require particular support. The executive training program for senior \nofficials and research activities will most likely involve most of  the ASEAN+3 countries.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $980,000,  of  which  the \nequivalent of $500,000 will be financed by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation \nand Poverty Reduction Fund, funded by the Government of the PRC, and the equivalent of \n$400,000  will be financed by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis and will be administered by ADB. The ASEAN Secretariat \nand governments of participating ASEAN+3 member countries will provide counterpart support, \nincluding salaries of participating staff from government agencies for the duration of the training \nprograms, estimated at $80,000. The detailed cost estimates and proposed financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the TA Implementing and Executing Agency, in close collaboration with the \nASEAN Secretariat, relevant ASEAN+3 finance ministries and central banks, and ADB regional \ndepartments as in previous REFM training courses. REFM courses\u2019 trainees will coordinate \nclosely with OREI during the training period at ADB headquarters in Manila. The TA will be \ncarried  out  over  17 months  starting  in  August  2006  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by \nDecember 2007. ADB will provide other resources needed for routine operations.  \n \n14.  National and international consultants as well as resource persons will be engaged as \nindividuals for delivering the training programs and preparations of research output. The terms \nof reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. National consultants will \nbe engaged to (i) coordinate for the revision, planning, and implementation of the REFM course; \nand (ii) facilitate its logistic arrangements and organization, including day-to-day assistance to \nthe trainees. To deliver the REFM training course, one international consultant and five national \nconsultants  will  be  engaged.  The  international  consultant  will  have  solid  experience  in \nmacroeconomics and financial programming, including experience in teaching these and related \nsubjects to government officials. The five national consultants will be expert in the following \nfields: (i) Microsoft Excel; (ii) statistics and econometrics; (iii) financial crises and financial \nstability assessment; (iv) macroeconomics, including trade, investment, and global payments \nimbalances; and (v) VIEWS. For this course, ADB will provide round-trip economy airfare, per \ndiem, hotel accommodation, and miscellaneous travel expenses for the trainees, plus training \nmaterial and logistics. Three well-known macroeconomists will be engaged as resource persons \nto deliver the modules on financial stability assessment, monetary and exchange rate policy, \nand fiscal policy under the executive training program for senior government officials. ADB will \nprovide round-trip business airfare, per diem, hotel accommodation, and miscellaneous travel \nexpenses for the trainees, plus training material and logistics for organizing the modules. Three \nto five resource persons and/or international consultants will be engaged to conduct economic \nresearch in close collaboration with the Research Group established under the ASEAN+3 FMP. \nSelection and individual engagement of consultants and resource persons will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. National consultants will be engaged for 30 person-\nmonths and international consultants for 15 person-months. Participation in all TA activities will \nbe on a voluntary basis. During the training periods, the trainees\u2019 salaries will continue to be met \nby their respective governments. Trainees will not be employees of ADB. Any privileges and \nimmunities that the Government of the Philippines may grant to trainees will be a matter for \nnegotiation between the governments concerned and the Government of the Philippines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on \na grant basis, for Technical Training and Capacity Building for Selected ASEAN+3 Countries on \nRegional Economic and Financial Monitoring, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
