During  an  economic  contact  mission  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in \nJune 2006, the Government of Brunei Darussalam (Brunei) requested ADB to provide technical \nassistance  (TA)  for  the  establishment  of  a  well-functioning  capital  market  supported  by  a \nmodernized payment and settlement system, to promote a more diversified economy. ADB \nfielded a fact-finding mission in November 2006 to discuss and reach an understanding with the \nGovernment about the objectives and scope of the proposed TA, the terms of reference for \nconsultants, and cost and implementation arrangements.1 The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  While per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Brunei is comparatively high by \nregional standards, economic activity is highly concentrated in the oil and gas sector, which \naccounts for roughly half of GDP, more than 90% of export earnings, and between 75% and \n90% of government revenue. The price volatility of oil and gas, and the finite and declining \nnature of reserves, means that the economy must diversify for more sustainable economic \ngrowth, more stable government revenue, and more varied employment opportunities for the \ngrowing and increasingly better educated labor force. \n \n3.  The Government has long recognized the implications of overdependence on oil and \ngas, and has made economic diversification a key goal in successive national development \nplans. Among the challenges the country faces in this regard are (i) the small size of the \ndomestic market, (ii) the Government\u2019s dominant role in the economy, and (iii) the limited base \nof entrepreneurial and managerial talent available in the country. \n \n4.  In  the  national  development  plan  published  most  recently  by  the  Government,  the \ndevelopment of the financial sector is a key part of economic diversification \u2014 both as a sector \nin itself and as a means of facilitating investment in other sectors.3 The capital market, in \nparticular, is seen as a niche area that will allow Brunei to (i) promote a more efficient and \nrobust financial sector by providing an alternative to bank lending and reducing dependence on \nit,  (ii)  attract  foreign  direct  investment  by  offering  an  avenue  for  divestment,  (iii) make \ngovernment-linked enterprises more competitive and eventually privatize them, and (iv) raise \nlong-term financing for major infrastructure projects. \n \n5.  The financial sector in Brunei is relatively small (about 4% of GDP in 2006) and is \ndominated by the banking sector. In 2007, there were 8 banks (6 foreign branches and 2 local \nbanks),  4  finance  companies,  1  Islamic  Trust  Fund,  13  insurance  companies  (including  3 \ntakaful)4, 33 money changers, and 34 remittance companies.  The Islamic Trust Fund and the \nfinance companies operate like banks (they take deposits and give loans) but do not offer \ncurrent accounts or demand deposits. Banks in Brunei take deposits from the private sector and \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 October 2006.  \n2  Brunei joined ADB in April 2006. While this TA will be Brunei\u2019s first TA, Brunei has also been and continues to be a \nparticipant in a range of regional cooperation\u2013related activities including TA 6298-REG. ADB. 2005.

The Government maintains large \ndeposits in the system but does not borrow from it. \n \n6.  Because the Government has such a dominant role in the economy and the private \nsector is underdeveloped, few loans are made to the corporate sector and most borrowing is \nconsumer related.5 The limited absorptive capacity of the private sector and the lack of other \ndomestic opportunities for investment create huge liquidity in the banking system, most of which \nis invested abroad (primarily in Singapore). \n \n7.  Important  gaps  in  laws  and  regulations  and  in  infrastructure  and  institutional \narrangements hamper the financial sector. The main check clearing system for banks is run by \nthe Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) in Brunei, which was appointed \nfor this purpose by the Brunei Association of Banks. The system handles an average of 3,500\u2013\n4,500 checks daily. There is no system for large-value payments. Checks are cleared manually, \non a T+3 basis. This is slow by modern standards, where T+1 or even same-day settlement is \nthe norm.  \n \n8.  The legal and regulatory basis for securities settlement is transaction-specific and is \ndefined through contractual agreements with the appointed primary dealers. This arrangement \ndoes  not  promote  the  participation  of  domestic  retail  investors,  the  development  of  more \ncomplex securities, or access to international investors. \n \n9.  Recognizing that it must deal with a wide range of issues before it can develop a \nwell-functioning capital market, the Government intends to achieve this goal over the next 10 \nyears through various initiatives. These include: (i) modernizing the payment and settlement \nsystem;  (ii) improving  corporate  governance  by  strengthening  accounting  and  auditing \nstandards, among other things; (iii) reinforcing the legal, regulatory, and supervisory framework; \nand (iv) boosting institutional capacity. \n \n10.  To promote the country as an international financial center, Brunei needs to effectively \nposition itself alongside established financial centers like Singapore and Hong Kong, China, \nwhich  also  offer  economic  and  political  stability,  well-developed  infrastructure,  high-quality \neducation and health facilities, multilingual professionals, and freedom from exchange controls, \nbesides having a much larger population. Two main factors distinguish Brunei from these other \nmarkets: (i) the absence of personal income taxes, and (ii) strong leadership and commitment to \nthe development of Islamic financial products. \n \n11.  The Government receives technical assistance and advisory support in financial sector \ndevelopment from the International Monetary Fund (consolidation of financial sector regulation \nand monetary authority), the World Bank (asset management and pension fund administration), \nand the Islamic Development Bank (Islamic financial legislation and human resource capacity \nbuilding).  The  Government  has  also  received  technical  assistance  in  insurance  from  the \nCommonwealth  Secretariat  and  is  receiving  assistance  in  bond  market  development  from \nNomura  Research  Institute  through  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN) \nSecretariat.6 \n \n                                                 \n5  The Government also lends to the private sector. The Treasury Department provides interest-free car loans and \nhousing loans to government officials. The Resettlement Department provides land and houses with 20-year \ninterest-free mortgages for residents. \n6  The ASEAN project will be closely coordinated with implementation of this TA. \n ", "         3 \n12.  Recent initiatives of the Government to promote capital market development include the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Adopting a comprehensive legal framework for the financial sector, including the \nnew Banking Order and Insurance Order passed in 2006, which incorporates \ninternational best-practice standards and regulates both conventional and Islamic \nfinancial products.  \n(ii)  Setting  up  the  Brunei  International  Financial  Centre  (BIFC),  an  international \nfinancial center that extends flexible business facilities, including tax-free status. \nBIFC has attracted international firms offering conventional as well as Islamic \nfinancial products. So far, six international banks, nine private mutual funds, and \nten investment advisers have been licensed.  \n(iii)  Establishing a Financial Intelligence Unit in February 2007 to combat money \nlaundering activities and other suspicious transactions. \n(iv)  Successfully issuing twelve series of short-term (91-day) and one year Islamic \ngovernment bonds (Sukuk Iljarah)7 totaling B$1.050 billion. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA will support economic diversification in Brunei by developing a more efficient and \nrobust financial sector. The expected outcome is a functional capital market supported by a \nmodernized payment and settlement system. The TA focuses on diagnostic studies to formulate \na capital market masterplan and a payment and settlement blueprint.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The  TA  includes  two  components.  Component  A  will  focus  on  capital  market \ndevelopment and component B on the modernization of the payment and settlement system. \nImplementation activities will be closely coordinated to take advantage of synergies and avoid \noverlaps between consultant deliverables. The TA will fund consultants with expertise in capital \nmarket  development,  capital  market  laws  and  regulations,  bond  markets,  payment  and \nsettlement systems, and financial sector information technology. Roundtable discussions will be \nheld with Government officials and stakeholders and international experts will be invited to \nshare international best practices to facilitate discussion and agreement on reform proposals. \n \n15.  Key activities in component A will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Conducting  diagnostic  studies  to  assess  impediments  to  capital  market \ndevelopment  arising  from  inadequacies  in  laws  and  regulations,  institutional \narrangements, supporting infrastructure, and technical capacity. 8  \n(ii)  Preparing  a  capital  market  master  plan,  including  recommendations  and  a \nrelated action plan for improving the legal and regulatory framework, institutional \narrangements, infrastructure, and capacity over the short, medium, and long \nterm.  \n                                                 \n7  Sukuk is a document or certificate that evidences the undivided pro-rata ownership of underlying assets. Ijarah is a \ntype of contract whereby a lessor (owner) leases out an asset (e.g. government building or equipment) at an \nagreed rental fee and pre-determined lease period.  IOSCO.  2004. Islamic Capital Market Fact \u2013 Finding Report. \n8  The diagnostic studies will not analyze in detail the pension and insurance sectors, the accounting and auditing \nframework, or human resource capability, but will refer to previous and ongoing work in these areas. \n ", "4 \n(iii)  Developing an implementation strategy. \n  \n16.  Key activities in component B will be as follows: \n \n(i)  Conducting of diagnostic studies to assess impediments to the development of a \nmodernized payment and settlement system arising from inadequacies in laws \nand  regulations,  institutional  arrangements,  supporting  infrastructure,  and \ntechnical capacity.  \n(ii)  Preparing a blueprint for a modernized payment and settlement system, including \nrecommendations and a related action plan for improving the legal and regulatory \nframework, institutional arrangements, infrastructure for payment and settlement, \nand related capacity over the short, medium, and long term. \n(iii)  Developing an implementation strategy. \n \n17.  The team leader will closely coordinate the preparation of the studies and the related \nrecommendations, all of which will be reflected in the capital market master plan and the related \npayment and settlement blueprint.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The initial cost of the TA to be funded by the Government through ADB is estimated to \nbe US$600,000.9 Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA and will form a \nsteering committee, chaired by the permanent secretary (monetary) of the EA, to oversee \nimplementation. The steering committee will appoint a project director for each component of \nthe TA.   \n \n20.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international consultant input. The international \nconsultants  will  include  a  capital  market  development  expert,  a  capital  market  legal  and \nregulatory expert, a bond market expert, a payment and settlement expert, and a financial \nsector information technology expert. The TA is expected to be implemented over 12 months, \nfrom June 2008 to May 2009. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  The consultants will be hired individually or through a firm by ADB through quality-based \nselection, according to the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). All service payments under the Project will conform to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \n22.  The  consultants  may  organize  study  tours  of  institutional  arrangements,  rules,  and \nprocedures for the capital market, as well as payment and settlement arrangements, in selected \ncountries  to  build  capacity  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  the  master  plan  and  the \nblueprint and other related forward-looking activities. The countries will be carefully selected for \ntheir relevance to the economic and financial status of Brunei. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB will recruit consultants, review and comment on consultant deliverables, pay the consultants from its ordinary \ncapital  resources,  bill  the  Government  for  all  direct  costs  (which  the  Government  has  agreed  to  promptly \nreimburse), and arrange and participate in tripartite meetings with the Government. ADB has agreed to waive \nfinancing charges incurred for the use of ADB funds for this project.   \n ", "         5 \n23.  The consultants will prepare detailed workplans within 2 weeks of mobilization. The \nworkplans will include timetables for deliverables defined for each component of the TA in \nconsultation with the EA and coordinated by the team leader. The consultants shall report \nmonthly on the progress of implementation of key activities in their workplans. Draft final reports \nwill be submitted by the deadline specified in the workplans after comments from the EA and \nADB are incorporated. Tripartite meetings will be held before the draft final report is finalized. \nThe final report, incorporating the comments of the EA and ADB during and after the tripartite \nmeeting, will be submitted at the end of the services.  \n \nIV.
