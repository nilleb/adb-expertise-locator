The Government of Indonesia has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to strengthen its anti-money-laundering (AML) regime. The Center for \nFinancial  Transaction  and  Reporting  Analysis (PPATK), the financial intelligence unit (FIU) \nmandated to combat money laundering in Indonesia, became operational in October 2003 when \nit first started receiving suspicious transaction reports (STRs). The request for this TA was made \nat  the  2004  Annual  Meeting  of  the  Asia/Pacific  Group  on  Money  Laundering  (APG). The \nIndonesia  Country  Strategy  and  Program  2003\u20132005  includes  financial  and  corporate \ngovernance as a strategic sector in ADB\u2019s assistance program. The TA is also in line with ADB's \npolicy, Enhancing ADB's Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism.1 \nBased upon consultations from July- October 2004, the Government and ADB reached an \nagreement on the  objectives, scope, cost estimates and financing plan, and implementation \narrangements.  This  TA2  will  build  capacity  to  effectively  implement  the  AML  laws  and \nregulations  established  under  ADB  TA  3849:  Development  of  an  Anti-Money-Laundering \nRegime,3 and complement other assistance from funding agencies.  The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia has been diligently working to establish an effective AML regime to improve \ngovernance, fight corruption, and strengthen the financial system. Following the APG Mutual \nEvaluation  Report  on  Indonesia  in  2002,  extensive  efforts  were  made  to  address  the \nweaknesses in the legal framework and develop operational capability for AML. The Financial \nAction  Task  Force  on  Money  Laundering  (FATF)4  recognizes  Indonesia\u2019s  progress  in \ndeveloping an AML regime, as well as areas for further action, including building AML systems \nand  compliance  programs  with  full  on-site  examinations,  successfully  prosecuting  money-\nlaundering cases, and demonstration of effective mutual legal assistance. An on-site visit by \nFATF to Indonesia is planned that may pave the way for removal of Indonesia from the non-\ncooperative countries and territories (NCCT) list5 in 2005. \n \n3.  To improve oversight and implementation of AML laws and regulations, the nonbank \nfinancial services supervisory agencies need to develop AML standard operating procedures \n(SOPs) and audit procedures for assessing compliance with AML laws and regulations. In \nNovember 2004, the Government announced plans to merge the nonbank supervisory agencies \nas a transitional measure to the consolidated regulatory and supervisory body for financial \nservices mandated under Act No. 23 of 1999 concerning Bank Indonesia (BI Act). The merger is \ntargeted for 2005 and would combine the Capital Market Supervisory Agency (BAPEPAM) and \nthe Directorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI), the supervisor for insurance, pensions, \nand other nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). The new institution is expected to function as \nan independent supervisory agency for NBFIs. SOPs and compliance frameworks need to be \ndeveloped to provide continuing effective AML oversight as BAPEPAM and DGFI merge. \nContinuing education and support is also needed by NBFIs for effective industry compliance.  \n \n                                                 \n1  R45-03 issued in 2003. \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 18 October 2004.  \n3  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to Indonesia for the Development of an Anti-Money Laundering Regime. Manila \n(TA 3849, approved for $1.5 million) and ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Financial Governance and Social Security \nReform Program. Manila (L1965, approved for $250 million), also included actions to support the establishment of \nthe AML regime. \n4  OECD. 2002. Annual Review of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories. Paris. \n5  In 2001, FATF added Indonesia to the NCCT list after determining that the country lacked AML measures. \n ", "2  \n4.  As  supervisory  agencies  strengthen  their  AML  systems  and  staff  knowledge  and \nunderstanding of STRs and financial institutions implement effective compliance programs, the \nnumber of STRs may increase. In addition, as people gain confidence  in the Government \nregulation  that  provides  personal  protection  to  witnesses  and  reporting  parties  and  their \nfamilies,6 more information and STRs may emerge. An on-line web-based system for reporting \nSTRs was launched by PPATK in December 2003.7 As of 15 October 2004, PPATK had \nreceived 984 STRs from 51 banks, 4 NBFIs, and 3 money changers. This includes STRs from \nthe Special Unit for Banking Investigation at BI, which conducted PPATK\u2019s functions for banks \nbefore October 2003. PPATK reported 98 cases from 270 STRs to the Indonesian National \nPolice, which passed 20 of these cases to the Attorney General\u2019s Office. Of these, 18 are being \nexamined by the Attorney General\u2019s Office and 2 have been decided by the court. In one case, \nthe defendant was found guilty of banking fraud, and in the other the defendant was found guilty \nof corruption. In one money-laundering case, the court decided that evidence was insufficient. \nOn reviewing the case, PPATK recognized the need for more comprehensive presentation of \nevidence for successful prosecution.  Increased capacity within the Attorney General\u2019s Office \nand the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights (MOJHR) will be very important for effective \nhandling of evidence in court cases and prosecution.  \n \n5.  Access to international  information  and  evidence  is  also  important  for  analysis  and \nprosecution in certain AML cases. PPATK broadened its framework for international cooperation \nthrough memorandums of understanding with FIUs in Australia; Hong Kong, China;8 Malaysia; \nPhilippines; Republic of Korea; Romania; and Thailand. PPATK\u2019s membership in the Egmont \nGroup of FIUs (Egmont Group) will also significantly increase PPATK\u2019s access to international \ninformation. PPATK was accepted as a member of the Egmont Group at its plenary meeting in \nJune 2004. The Egmont Group is an informal international organization established in 1995 to \ndevelop FIUs and a global information network, and currently has 94 member countries.  A \nmutual legal assistance law is also under preparation with assistance from the United States \nAgency  for  International  Development  (USAID)  that  will  provide  a  framework  for  broader \ncooperation and exchange. To maximize benefits from access to international information, it is \nimportant to build capacity in the Attorney General\u2019s Office and the MOJHR for proper handling \nand presentation of international information and evidence. \n \n6.  Sustainable, cost effective in-country AML training is important to accommodate the vast \nnumbers of people who need basic training and education to sensitize staff to AML issues and \ndimensions in their work or business practices. The appropriate use of information technology in \ncomputer-based training (CBT) can enable organizations to train more people more effectively \nand cheaply. CBT can complement the specialized, mentored international assistance and \nprovide core standardized training in line with best practices.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.   The purpose of the TA is to strengthen the AML regime and combat money laundering \neffectively in order to strengthen the financial system and its governance. Proper controls for \nmoney laundering will reduce vulnerability to other types of crime such as trafficking in drugs \nand people, and corruption. The TA will support  proper  implementation  of  AML  laws  and \nregulations; strengthen nonbank supervision and audit procedures; build capacity to prosecute \n                                                 \n6  Government Regulation 57 (2003) concerning Special Protection for Witnesses and Reporting Parties of Criminal \nActs of Money Laundering. \n7  www.ppatk.go.id. \n8  An exchange of letters was signed with Hong Kong, China.  \n ", "  3\nand adjudicate money-laundering cases; increase understanding of AML compliance among \nNBFIs; and support sustainable in-country AML CBT. The TA will provide assistance to DGFI, \nBAPEPAM,  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office,  and  MOJHR.  The  project  design  draws  upon  the \nGovernment\u2019s request at the APG 2004 Annual Meeting, and has been developed through close \nongoing dialogue with PPATK and other Government agencies. This TA complements AML \nassistance provided in the banking sector and other areas by agencies including Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency \n(JICA),  World  Bank,  USAID,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  Asia-Europe Meeting \n(ASEM), and others. The expected outputs of the TA are: \n \n(i)  Nonbank AML supervision policies and procedures: The experts will provide the \nfollowing in accordance with AML best practices \n  \n(a)  Standard operating procedures for NBFI supervisors.  \n(b)  Audit procedures for NBFI examiners to assess compliance with AML law \nand regulations. \n(c)  Analysis of test audit cases of NBFIs to determine if special issues hinder \naudit procedures, and recommendations to address these issues. \n(d)  International case studies on AML CFT best practices, including audit \nprocedures and on-site examinations in the nonbank financial sector. \n(e)  Draft  decrees  for  NBFI  supervisors  to  support  implementation  of  the \nrecommended supervision approaches and policies. \n \n(ii)  Increased capacity for prosecution and adjudication of AML cases: \n \nThe Attorney General's Office and MOJHR will have an expanded capacity for \nprosecution  and  adjudication  of  AML  cases  through  specialized,  mentored \ntraining for prosecutors and judges in areas including asset forfeiture, seizure, \ncustody, maintenance, and disposition procedures for presenting evidence; best \npractices  for  money-laundering  prosecution  and  adjudication;  obtaining \nassistance from other countries; making international requests for evidence; and \nhandling foreign-obtained evidence and testimony in court. International case \nstudies on best practices for AML CFT prosecution and adjudication will also be \nprovided. \n \n(iii)  Sustainable computer-based training (CBT) for AML:  \n   \n  A CBT center will be established at PPATK to train staff in Government agencies \nand  financial  services  firms.  CBT  modules  will  be  developed  based  on  the \ntraining conducted under the TA for nonbank financial services supervisors, \nprosecutors, and judges. These modules will be developed in cooperation with \nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and complement the \nAML CBT program developed by UNODC in 20039. UNODC CBT programs10 are \nstandardized training courses adapted to local environments  and delivered in \n                                                 \n9  UNODC AML CBT is currently being delivered in the Pacific and East and West Africa. \n10 Since 1997, UNODC has also provided CBT for drug law enforcement training in Barbados, Cambodia, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Fiji, Jamaica, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, Turkey, and Viet \nNam. The AML CBT will be implemented in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines. \n ", "4  \nlocal languages. The UNODC modules11 will be installed at the PPATK center \nalong with the new modules developed under the TA12. CBT programs are \nadvantageous because of the continuous availability, flexible scheduling, one-to-\none training, economical delivery of knowledge and skills; and standardization of \ntraining for best practices. UNODC will implement its AML CBT program in \nIndonesia,  Malaysia,  and  the  Philippines  during  2005-2006.  UNODC  CBT \ncenters in Indonesia will be located at the Jakarta seaport, Jakarta international \nairport, four police offices, the national police training college in Semarang, and \nthe criminal investigation training college in Bogor.  \n \n(iv)  Education for nonbank financial institutions on AML compliance:  \n \n  Nonbank financial institutions, including insurance firms, pension funds, finance \ncompanies, securities companies, and brokerage firms will be educated through \nAML  seminars  on  best  practices  on  AML  compliance  for  nonbank  financial \nservices sector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will be conducted in consultation with APG, the leading regional AML body that \nfacilitates  the  adoption,  implementation,  and  enforcement  of  internationally  accepted  AML \nstandards as set out in FATF\u2019s 40 recommendations. As an observer international organization \nof APG and FATF, ADB coordinates with these bodies in its AML activities and programs. CBT \nmaterials will be developed in cooperation with the UNODC and its Global Programme Against \nMoney Laundering. A letter of intent has been prepared between UNODC and ADB to facilitate \ncooperation in CBT in the Asian region. ADB will continue to coordinate closely with other \nfunding agencies and participate in PPATK coordination meetings. AML assistance in Indonesia \nis centrally coordinated through PPATK to facilitate effective resource allocation and sequencing \nof assistance. Workshops will be conducted for (i) NBFI supervisors in areas including AML \nnonbank supervisory frameworks, SOPs, and audit procedures; and (ii) the Attorney General\u2019s \nOffice and MOJHR on best practices for AML CFT prosecution and adjudication. To build \ncapacity,  specialized,  mentored  training  for  prosecutors  and  judges  will  also  be  provided.  \nEducational seminars on AML compliance will be conducted for NBFIs in Jakarta and selected \nprovinces. To facilitate assessment of the TA and impact, the Government will provide ADB with \na  copy  of  APG  and  FATF  country  reports  and  assessments,  PPATK  reports  and  other \ninformation on a timely basis. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of \n$390,000 and a local currency cost of $235,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to provide $500,000 to finance the entire foreign exchange cost of $390,000 and $110,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the \n                                                 \n11 The UNODC AML modules are (i) what money laundering is, (ii) money-laundering methods, (iii) role of traditional \nfinancial institutions, (iv) nontraditional financial institutions; (v) money-laundering havens; (vi) FIUs; (vii) financial \ninvestigations; (viii) financial records; (ix) informants in financial investigations; (x) undercover operations for \nfinancial investigations; (xi) net-worth analysis; (xii) search operations during financial investigations; and (xiii) \ninterviews for financial investigations.  \n12\n A CBT mobile unit will not be piloted at this stage based on UNODC experience in other countries which showed a   \nhigher cost and implementation risk relative to small CBT centers. Following the establishment of UNODC and \nPPATK CBT centers this option could be reevaluated. \n \n ", "  5\nCooperation Fund for Regional Trade and Financial Security Initiative13 and administered by \nADB. The Government will provide the remaining $125,000 equivalent by providing counterpart \nstaff and office facilities. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  PPATK will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over \n12 months, from March 2005 to February 2006. The implementing agencies will be DGFI and \nBAPEPAM  for  components  (i)  and  (iv),  the  Attorney  General\u2019s  Office  and  MOJHR  for \ncomponent (ii), and PPATK for component (iii). The TA will require an estimated 12 person-\nmonths of international consulting services. Requirements for consulting services include two \ninternational AML experts for non-bank supervision and compliance, and one international AML \nexpert for prosecution and adjudication of AML cases. PPATK staff will  jointly conduct the \neducational seminars for NBFIs with the international consultants. PPATK will also provide \ncounterpart  staff  and  office  accommodation.  ADB  will  engage  individual  consultants  in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its \nBorrowers. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will \nprovide inception, interim, and final reports, and provide weekly briefings to PPATK. The \nconsultants will submit an inception report within two weeks of TA commencement, and an \ninterim report and draft final report in accordance with schedules to be agreed with ADB and \nPPATK. \n \n11.   UNODC  will  install  the  UNODC  CBT  modules  at  PPATK  and  train  the  local  CBT \nmanagers. For production of new CBT modules, ADB will directly select the firm that produced \nthe  UNODC  CBT  modules,  based  upon  the  extensive  experience,  specialized  skills,  and \ncapacity to produce high-quality, compatible CBT modules. All services and equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n12.  TA results will be distributed through the PPATK, ADB, and APG web sites. Training \nmaterials will be distributed by the implementing agencies provided through PPATK\u2019s CBT \ncenter and locations designated by PPATK and UNODC, and posted on the PPATK, ADB, and \nAPG web sites.  \n \nIV.
