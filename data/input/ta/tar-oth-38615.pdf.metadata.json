Recognizing the limits to development imposed by their smallness and remoteness, \nPacific  island  countries  (PICs)  have  a  long  history  of  efforts  for  regional  cooperation  and \ninitiatives to provide public goods at the regional level. An extensive network of regional and \nsub-regional  organizations  exists  in  support  of  regional  cooperation  and  integration  in  the \nPacific.1 Regional institutions such as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat (ForumSec) and the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) follow a wide approach in support of regional \ncooperation and integration.2 PICs, however, are yet to effectively use regionalism to establish, \nmonitor, and enforce regulatory frameworks in a forward-looking and structured way.3 \n \n2.  To implement their enhanced vision for regional development, Pacific Islands Forum \n(PIF) leaders recently agreed to create a Pacific Plan for Strengthening Regional Cooperation \nand Integration, which aims to deepen and broaden regional cooperation by pooling regional \nresources. The vision of the Pacific Plan is included in the Leaders\u2019 Declaration adopted during \na special retreat in Auckland in April 2004. A task force comprising PIC senior officials and \nrepresentatives of regional organizations was formed by the PIF leaders to draft the Pacific Plan \nunder the management and guidance of the Forum Secretary General. \n \n3.  During a discussion at the Tokyo Forum on the Operational Dimensions of Supplying \nRegional  Public  Goods  through  Regional  Development  Assistance,  the  ForumSec  Deputy \nSecretary  General,  Mr.  Iosefa  Maiava,  requested  support  from  ADB  for  developing  and \nimplementing  the  Pacific  Plan.  In  particular, Mr.  Maiava  stressed  that  member  states,  the \nForumSec, and the Task Force needed assistance to increase their capacity to assess possible \nrationales,  principles,  and  approaches  underlying  Pacific  regionalism,  including  suitable \ninstitutional arrangements and their implementation processes. Given the limited availability of \nbudget resources and skilled personnel, it was suggested that assistance was needed to help \npolicy  makers  appreciate  the  benefits  and  costs  generated  by  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration for each country, and the opportunity costs of nonintegration for the overall region. In \naddition, Mr. Maiava explained that introducing a study program on regional cooperation and \nintegration in a regional academic institution such as the University of the South Pacific (USP) \nwill greatly help future leaders and policy makers develop awareness of conceptual, analytical, \nand practical tools relating to regionalism.  \n \n                                                 \n1 In this paper, the term \u201cregionalism\u201d refers to both regional cooperation and regional integration. Implying action and \ninitiative undertaken by regional and subregional agencies, regional cooperation defines a cooperative effort to \nachieve an outcome affecting two or more countries in the same region. Regional integration, on the other hand, \ncan be intended as the outcome of either regional cooperation or spontaneous market forces toward an increased \nlevel of interaction at the regional level, such as the adoption of uniform standards, the formation of single markets, \nor the consolidation of national systems into regional ones. \n2 There are notable examples in the Pacific of regional public goods such as higher education, fisheries management, \nand aviation safety provided through cooperation among PICs, respectively, the University of the South Pacific \n(USP), the Forum Fisheries Agency (FFA), and the Pacific Aviation Safety Office,. ForumSec, SPC, FFA, and USP \nare part of the Council of Regional Organizations of the Pacific (CROP), which gathers 10 members and is \npermanently chaired by the ForumSec Secretary-General. The other CROP agencies are (i) the Fiji School of \nMedicine,  (ii)  the  Pacific  Islands  Development  Programme,  (iii)  the  South  Pacific  Board  for  Educational \nAssessment, (iv) the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme, (v) the South Pacific Applied Geoscience \nCommission, and (vi) the South Pacific Tourism Organization.  \n3 Recently, steps have also been taken toward greater regional economic integration through the Pacific Agreement \non Closer Economic Relations (PACER), and in the area of trade through the Pacific Island Countries Trade \nAgreement (PICTA). \n ", "2  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  A  conceptual  framework  for  Pacific  regionalism  may  be  structured  into  three  main \ndimensions: (i) rationale for regional cooperation and integration, (ii) principles and approaches \nto be followed, and (iii) institutional arrangements set up by the member countries. Effective \nregionalism also greatly depends on the process chosen for implementing it. \n \n5.  Reasons for cooperation and integration at a regional level include capturing the benefits \nof economies of scale and scope, providing regional public goods (RPGs) in cases of market \nfailure, and creating solid regional groups to (a) offer protection against external threats, and (b) \ncreate a collective voice pushing for greater consideration of regional issues at the global level. \nSecuring the benefits of social and/or economic integration, and sharing relevant knowledge \nand  experience  provide  additional reasons  for  regionalism.  Regional  market  failures  justify \ncommon initiatives among countries to pool resources and move towards the provision of \nRPGs. Another driver for RPGs creation is the need to address transboundary issues and \nchallenges,  such  as  pollution,  communicable  diseases,  international  terrorism,  and  other \nregional public \"bads.\" For instance, collective regional response to the threat resulting from \nglobal climate change has proven to be a powerful tool for bringing together PICs. An additional \nrationale for providing RPGs in the Pacific is to address a specific type of governance failure: \nthe limited capacity of small nations to deliver relevant public goods at the national level.  \n \n6.  Regional institutions, development agencies, and national governments may promote \nregional cooperation and integration projects. Economic and social costs and benefits, as well \nas the return on investment are important factors to determine the viability of such projects. As \nnational  governments  face  budget  constraints,  they  should  be  convinced  that  the  regional \nsolution does not divert resources from their national priorities but creates additional benefits, \nwhich would not otherwise be captured. The justification for enhanced regional cooperation and \nintegration requires, therefore, a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis to show the impact of \nregionalism  on  the  budget  of  each  national  government.4  While  such  analysis  has  been \nattempted in the past for specific sectors in the Pacific, a broader approach is required to show \nthe opportunity cost of nonintegration for the overall region in aggregate terms.  \n \n7.  Countries may pursue regionalism through intergovernmental cooperation or by creating \ncommon institutions that are charged to deliberate on behalf of member countries in certain \ndefined  areas.  The  spectrum  of  possible  institutional  structures  is  very  wide,  from  loose \nconsultative arrangements, to formal cooperation among national bodies, to the establishment \nof common regional organizations. The chosen structures and rules to govern, promote, and \nimplement regionalism assume fundamental importance in determining the pace, scope, and \nextent of the emergence of the region as a cohesive group of countries. In general, participation \nin a regional group entails an implicit decision on the amount of national sovereignty that each \ncountry is ready to surrender in view of the benefits that the group can generate. Especially in \nthe presence of common institutions, the regional solution presents a trade-off with national \nsovereignty and member countries are requested to define the amount and the areas where \nthey are ready to substitute regional for national sovereignty. \n \n8.  Long and complex processes are involved in strengthening regional cooperation. There \nis no guarantee at the outset that regional initiatives will lead to agreements among prospective \nmembers, or produce outcomes acceptable to all parties. However, the presence of a carefully \n                                                 \n4 While the theory and literature on cost-benefit analysis of projects is fairly advanced and typically focuses on the \nallocative efficiency and income distribution effects of national projects, a multicountry framework for cost-benefit \nanalysis with emphasis on regional cooperation is still to be properly developed. An initial attempt to rationalize this \nissue is proposed in Adhikari, R. and J. Weiss: ADB. 1999. Economic Analysis of Subregional Projects. Manila. \n ", "  3\nthought-out process for implementing issues with a regional dimension will likely maximize the \nprospects for a beneficial outcome. Agreement on a common challenge may lead participants to \none of the following decisions: (i) no commitment, (ii) commitment to pursue individual action, or \n(iii) commitment to pursue regional collective action. The latter may result in consideration of the \nrationale, principles, approaches, and institutional arrangements. Cost-benefit analysis for all \ncountries and the region as a whole is critical and could effectively be followed by an agreement \non the need for any differential treatment among members. While de facto regional integration \nmay develop through the spontaneous action of market forces, outcomes of planned regional \ncooperation may range from informal agreements, to loose consultations, to the creation of pure \nRPGs or fully excludable \"club goods.\"  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n \n9.  The technical assistance (TA) will support all 13 Pacific developing member countries \n(PDMCs)5 that are PIF members. The goal of the TA is to assist the ForumSec in enhancing \nPacific regionalism through the Pacific Plan. As such, all activities carried out under the TA will \nbe fully coordinated with those of the Pacific Plan Task Force (PPTF) through the ForumSec \nand  in  compliance  with  the  aim  and  objectives  of  the  Pacific  Plan.  Aiming  to  increase \nparticipation, ownership, and regional collective action, the TA will help in particular the PPTF \nand member states increase their appreciation of regionalism, including issues related to the \ncosts and benefits of Pacific regional cooperation and integration. The TA also aims to facilitate \nthe  inclusion  of  the  Pacific  Plan  resolutions  on  regional  initiatives  in  the  PICs\u2019  national \ndevelopment  strategies.  With  a  longer-term  view,  introduction  of  one  or  more  courses  on \nregionalism  to  the  academic  program  at  USP  can  be  induced  through  spillover  effects \ngenerated by this TA. The TA's goals, purpose, and scope are summarized in the TA framework \n(Appendix 1).6 \n \n10.  The main outputs of the TA are: (i) enhanced capacity of the members of the PPTF and \nthe ForumSec to recommend a Pacific Plan underpinned by a clear rationale, including an \nanalytical framework for cost-benefit analysis of regional programs; and (ii) increased PDMC \ncapacity to analyze the Pacific Plan recommendations and to frame appropriate responses and \nfollow-up  action,  based  on  improved  understanding  of  the  costs  and  benefits  of  regional \nprograms and options. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA consultants\u2019 team will be an integral part of the recently established Pacific Plan \nOffice (PPO) at the ForumSec, and will receive secretarial and logistic support from PPO staff. \nPPO has been created to facilitate the Pacific Plan development and implementation. The \nForumSec Deputy Secretary General will: (i) provide support and advice to the consultants\u2019 \nteam on the rationale and dynamics involved in the Pacific Plan preparations, the PPTF, and the \nForumSec; (ii) liaise between the ForumSec, the PPTF, and ADB through the South Pacific \nSubregional Office; and (iii) coordinate the inputs and activities of the TA consultants\u2019 team with \nthe PPTF and ADB. All TA activities need to be timely and applicable to Pacific circumstances.  \n                                                 \n5 Cook Islands,  Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n6 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 5 November 2004 under the name \nDeveloping an Analytical Framework for the Pacific Plan.  \n ", "4  \n12.  Key TA activities are as follows: \n(i)  establishment of a project consultants\u2019 team at the ForumSec\u2019s PPO to support the \nwork of the PPTF and preparation of the Pacific Plan; \n(ii)  provision of policy and technical support (both advisory and written) to the PPTF \nthrough the ForumSec\u2019s PPO, toward preparation of the Pacific Plan report and \nrecommendations, including national consultations; \n(iii)  organization of three subregional seminars in 2005 (preferably one in each of the \nthree sub-groups of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia) for members of the \nPPTF,  politicians,  senior  government  officials,  and  PICs\u2019  non-state  actors \nrepresentatives to (a) consider the draft Pacific Plan based on outcomes of the \nnational  consultations;  (b)  discuss  the  concept  and  rationale  for  Pacific \nregionalism, including the cost-benefit analytical framework; and (c) facilitate the \ninclusion  of  Pacific  Plan  resolutions  in  individual  PICs\u2019  national  development \nstrategies and planning (and budgeting);  \n(iv)  publication\u2014Enhancing  Pacific  Regionalism\u2014designed  for  use  as  a  practical \nreference tool for officials from PICs and Pacific regional institutions to assess \nregional cooperation and integration issues, summarizing the contributions from \nthe various TA consultants; and \n(v)  design of an academic course on Pacific regionalism to be introduced at USP, \nincluding support for postgraduate research activity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000 to be entirely financed by ADB on a grant basis \nfrom the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  ForumSec  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  All  TA  activities  will  be \nimplemented through the PPO, under the guidance and direction of the ForumSec Deputy \nSecretary General who will ensure full coordination with the PPTF. ADB will be responsible for \nimplementing the TA, in close coordination with the ForumSec as the Executing Agency, under \nthe direction of the ForumSec Deputy Secretary General. A team of five international and \ndomestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  to  provide  18  person-months  of  consulting \nservices.7 The consultants will be individually selected in consultation with the ForumSec and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  team  will \ncomprise a (i) regional integration specialist/economist-team leader (international, 3 person-\nmonths); (ii) a cost-benefit analysis specialist (international, 3 person-months); (iii) a Pacific \ncommunications  specialist  (international,  3  person-months);  (iv)  a  capacity  development \nspecialist (international, 3 person-months); and (v) a project assistant (domestic, 6 person-\nmonths). The detailed terms of reference are in Appendix 3.   \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months, from 15 February to 15 November 2005. \nThe TA consultants\u2019 team will receive directions from the ForumSec Deputy Secretary General, \nwho will liaise with ADB through the South Pacific Sub-regional Office. The consultants\u2019 team \nleader, with the assistance of the project assistant, will be responsible for coordinating the TA \noutputs. The consultants will contribute to the inception and final reports to be prepared by the \nproject assistant under the guidance of the ForumSec Deputy Secretary General. The TA \nconsultants will also contribute to the publication Enhancing Pacific Regionalism. \n                                                 \n7 Comprising 12 person-months for four international consultants and 6 person-months for a domestic consultant \n ", "  5\n  \nIV.
