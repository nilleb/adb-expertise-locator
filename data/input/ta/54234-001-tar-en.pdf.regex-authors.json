INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  aims  to  strengthen  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  on  skills  development  in  higher  education  and  technical  and \nvocational  education  and  training  (TVET).1 Conceptualized  by  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic  Cooperation  (CAREC)  Program  Secretariat  in  the  Regional  Cooperation  and \nOperations Coordination Division (CWRC) of the Central and West Asia Department at the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the TA is part of the human development cluster of the CAREC 2030 \nstrategic framework and built on the CAREC Secretariat\u2019s scoping study results on the topic in \n2019.2 The scoping study recommended strengthening skills development in higher education \nand TVET in the CAREC region, suggesting a phased approach of establishing, in the short term \nof less than 3 years, expert groups on themes of regional relevance, such as improving quality \nstandards and harmonization, academic and skill mobility, and labor market information; and of \ndeveloping  in  the  long  term,  a  sector  committee  and  a  strategic  framework  for  regional \ncooperation and investment financing. \n \n2.  Building on the findings of the scoping study, the TA will improve four key areas of (i) \nstandardization and harmonization in higher education, (ii) standardization and harmonization in \nTVET, (iii) governance and regulation of recruitment systems, and (iv) development of labor \nmarket database and information system. The TA\u2019s main focus is to improve systems and \ngovernances at the country and regional levels, considering global best practices, the countries\u2019 \ndiverse  backgrounds,  and  geographical  context,  as  well  as  the  countries\u2019  agendas,  key \nstakeholders\u2019 requests from the previous consultations, and other previous and ongoing initiatives \nto ensure strong buy-in and synergy while avoiding duplication. \n \n3.  The TA supports the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 4.3 on \nensuring equal access for all women and men to affordable quality technical, vocational, and \ntertiary education, and SDG 4.4 on increasing the number of youth and adults with relevant \ntechnical and vocational skills for employment, decent jobs, and entrepreneurship. The TA is also \naligned with ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities, specifically operational priority 1 on \naddressing remaining poverty through education and training, 2 on accelerating progress in \ngender equality, 6 on strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and 7 on fostering \nregional cooperation and integration. The TA also supports the CAREC Gender Strategy 2030: \nInclusion, Empowerment, and Resilience for All by favoring women in some of its interventions.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Higher education and TVET in the CAREC region face significant challenges, reflected in \nthe overall low quality of skills, gaps in skills demand and supply, resource constraints, outdated \neducation  and  training  systems,  and  weak  governance.4 As  skills  development  worldwide \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 July 2021. Basic or primary level \neducation is an important component for pathways to TVET and higher education to support an integral part of the \nlifelong learning, but it is excluded in this TA.  \n2  The five clusters of the CAREC 2030 strategic framework are economic and financial stability; trade, tourism, and \neconomic corridors; infrastructure and connectivity; agriculture and water; and human development.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nimproves fast, there is a risk that the region could be left behind and suffer from a \u201cbrain drain\u201d \nsituation as its talented workforce is attracted to work elsewhere. The region needs to improve its \nskill standards to be more competitive to provide a strong basis for increased foreign direct \ninvestments and people-to-people connections.  \n \n5.  The CAREC countries have significant differences in income level, education tradition, \nand training system. They are also members of different regional groupings, such as the British \nCommonwealth  (Pakistan),  the  former  Soviet  Union  (seven  countries),  Mongolia,  and  the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), which should be treated separately as a resource country \nbecause of the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction funding and the PRC\u2019s achievements in the \nareas covered by the TA. Despite these differences, the CAREC program provides a platform for \nregional cooperation, integration, and learning among member countries, including on the best \npractices in higher education and TVET.5 The diverse background calls for a multi-pronged and \ndifferentiated approach in implementation to promote a participatory approach by emphasizing \nfacilitation and allowing countries to participate whenever they are ready. \n \n6.  On  improving  higher  education,  models  on  regional  skills  development  through \nstandardization and harmonization exist already. The Bologna Process in the European Union \nprovides a good example, in which Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Kazakhstan are already part of the \nBologna Process, while the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan aspire to join.6 This should be \ncomplemented by more specific bilateral and/or regional collaborations, such as (i) working with \ntop universities to develop branch campuses, dual and/or joint programs, faculty and/or student \nexchanges favoring women, and others; (ii) developing bilateral and/or regional qualifications as \npart of standardization and harmonization; and (iii) establishing a university network in the CAREC \nregion.7  \n \n7.  Improving standardization and harmonization in TVET can be facilitated by establishing \ninstitutional networks for standardization and harmonization systems for selected occupations \nwidely demanded by global and regional markets and relevant to the countries\u2019 needs as well as \nby favoring women workers. Cross-country collaborations in selected occupations can also be \ndeveloped through institutional twinning arrangements of bilateral and/or regional collaborations. \nThese have been done in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam under \nADB\u2019s  TA  implemented  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Human  Resource  Development \nStrategic Framework and Action Plan (phase 1).8 A toolbox for a training manual for tourism \nprofessionals, developed for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, \ncould be a model for countries in the CAREC region, in line with an earlier assessment by the \nCAREC Secretariat.9 \n \n5  ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Sharing ADB's Operational Knowledge in \nTechnical and Vocational Education and Training in the People\u2019s Republic of China with CAREC Member Countries. \nManila. This document provides an example of how ADB's operational knowledge and policy lessons on TVET in the \nPRC are shared with other countries under the CAREC program. \n6  The basic framework of the Bologna Process is to: (i) introduce a three-cycle higher education system comprising \nbachelor's, master's, and doctoral studies; (ii) ensure the mutual recognition of qualifications and learning periods \nabroad completed at other universities; and (iii) implement a system of quality assurance to strengthen the quality \nand relevance of learning and teaching. \n7  The ASEAN University Network provides a model for a regional university network focusing on academic cooperation, \nstudent and staff mobility, and international relations involving 30 participating universities. It was established in \nNovember 1995 through the signing of a charter by the ministers of higher education of six ASEAN countries, which \nhas now been expanded to cover all 10 ASEAN countries (ASEAN University Network. http://www.aunsec.org/).  \n8  ADB. 2009.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: Human development improved through \nincreased quality, mobility, and productivity of the labor force of the CAREC countries.10 The \nexpected outcome is regional cooperation and integration in the CAREC region strengthened \nthrough better utilization and allocation of human resources, in line with the CAREC 2030 Strategy \nand Strategy 2030 Operational Plan.11 This will be achieved through the development of four key \noutputs: (i) strengthened standardization and harmonization in higher education, (ii) strengthened \nstandardization  and  harmonization  in  TVET,  (iii)  improved  governance  and  regulation  of \nrecruitment systems, and (iv) developed labor market database and information system. In doing \nso, the TA will use a high-tech and innovative approach and collaborate with existing ADB country-\nspecific TAs that share the same interests. The design and monitoring framework of the TA is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Standardization and harmonization in higher education strengthened. The \nstrengthening of higher education in the CAREC region will be conducted through (i) collaboration \nbetween universities in the CAREC region and top leading universities in Japan and/or the rest of \nthe world, including through encouraging faculty and student exchanges comprising both women \nand men, and by incorporating distance or e-learning modality;12 (ii) setting up a regional \nuniversity  network  initiative;  (iii)  establishing  a  cross-country  interagency  working  group \ncomprising of women and men professionals in higher education; and (iv) developing bilateral \nand/or regional higher education standardization and harmonization frameworks.13  \n \n10.  Output 2: Standardization and harmonization in TVET strengthened. This will be \nconducted  through  developing  (i)  collaborations  with  Japanese  and/or  top  global  leading \ninstitutions, including through encouraging faculty, student, and trainee exchanges comprising \nboth women and men, and incorporating distance learning; (ii) a toolbox of training manuals for \nspecific occupations such as tourism professionals and other occupations favoring women; (iii) a \ncross-country interagency working group comprising of women and men professionals in TVET; \n(iv)  bilateral  and/or  regional  TVET  standardization  and  harmonization  frameworks;  and  (v) \nbilateral and/or regional agreements for institutional collaborations for selected occupations. \n \n11.  Output 3: Governance and regulation of recruitment systems improved. To improve \nskills mobility in the region, the TA will conduct comprehensive assessments of the cross-border \nrecruitment rules and regulations of the private recruitment agencies, government-to-government, \nand business-to-business schemes for more efficient and transparent labor mobility in the region \n \n10 In line with the CAREC Strategy 2030 and individual country partnership strategies. \n11 ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila; and ADB. 2019. \nStrategy 2030 Operational Plans. Manila \n12 Two models for collaboration at bilateral and/or multi-country and regional levels are being considered. First is a \ncollaboration with the ASEAN University Network and 10 Japanese universities: Chiba University, Kanazawa \nUniversity,  Keio  University,  Kumamoto  University,  Kyoto  University,  Nagasaki  University,  Niigata  University, \nOkayama University, Tokyo Institute of Technology, and Waseda University in the area of subject or program-specific \nto promote common interests among two or more countries. Second is fostering bilateral partnerships such as \nbetween Tsukuba University in Japan and Oguz Khan University in Turkmenistan as suggested by the Japanese \nEmbassy in Turkmenistan and the Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n13 Given the diverse backgrounds, the stage of developing such a framework could follow a bottom-up approach starting \nfrom a bilateral and/or sub-regional to a CAREC level framework. \n ", "4 \nand beyond. This is to facilitate more \u201cbrain circulation\u201d (i.e., more cross-country mobility of skilled \nworkers) and reduce \u201cbrain drain\u201d. The TA will consider the impact of external risks, such as from \nthe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on recruitment systems, which are critical, because the \nregion remains an important source of global migrant workers.14  \n \n12.  Output 4: Labor market database and information system developed. The system is \nto facilitate regular and comprehensive assessments on job and labor market issues including on \nsocial protection and skill mobility to contribute to the evidence-based decision-making process \nby providing key labor market information and labor characteristics across countries. To maximize \nthe project\u2019s impact and to make it long-lasting, the system will introduce non-traditional innovative \nindicators, such as employment by skills and qualifications with their projections, to be able to \nassess skill gap and skill mismatch. The system will also be made user-friendly and available \nonline by maximizing advanced information technology application to attract wider users from the \ngovernment institutions, think tanks, and academia, among others.15 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  administered  by  ADB.  The  key  expenditure  items \nallowable under the fund are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  CWRC  will  implement the  TA.  The  TA  will \ncollaborate with the CAREC Institute, related ADB resident missions, the Social Sector Division \nof  the  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  the  East  Asia  Department,  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department, and other regional and knowledge departments. \nThe main counterparts in the TA implementation will be focal point institutions, universities and \nTVET centers, civil society organizations of professional groups, training institutes, think tanks, \nand other related institutions in the region. The project counterparts will also be supported by \nexperts  from  Japan  and/or  other  countries.  The  TA  will  build  strong  synergies  with  the \ngovernments and private sector institutions related to higher education and TVET to strengthen \nthe project impacts and countries\u2019 ownerships. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 36 months (October 2021\u2013September 2024) in a flexible \nmanner so that the terms of references, duration, and schedule of TA inputs will be adjusted to \nmeet the capacity building needs of the participating countries and to ensure that TA funds are \nused in a cost-effective manner.  \n \n16.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n \n \n \n14 In 2017, there were about 21 million emigrants from the CAREC member countries, excluding the PRC. Russia \nremains an important destination, hosting 30% of them, followed by Iran, Pakistan, and Saudi Arabia. Other popular \ndestinations are Germany, India, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, and the United Kingdom. \nWorld Bank.
