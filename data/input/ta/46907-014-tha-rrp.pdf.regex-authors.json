I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nof up to $185,000,000.00 to Gulf JP UT Company Limited (GUT) for the Ayudhaya Natural Gas \nPower Project in Thailand. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  The Thai power sector is structured under a single buyer model whereby the Electricity \nGenerating  Authority  of  Thailand  (EGAT)\u2014the  state  utility\u2014enables  limited  private  sector \nparticipation in the generation sector while maintaining control over system planning, operation, \nand pricing. EGAT owns and operates the largest share of Thailand\u2019s installed generation \ncapacity  and  is  the  country\u2019s  single  wholesale  purchaser  of  electricity  and  supplier  (as \ntransmission  owner  and  operator)  to  the  country\u2019s  two  state-owned  electricity  distribution \nauthorities\u2014the Metropolitan Electricity Authority and the Provincial Electricity Authority.   \n \n3.  The  government  has  opened  access  for  the  private  sector  to  participate  in  the \ngeneration  business  through  specific  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP)  programs  for \nindependent power producers (IPPs), small power producers, and very small power producers. \nThe PPP programs allow private developers to construct, own, and operate power projects and \nenter into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with EGAT with terms up to 25 years. IPPs are \nlarge-scale private power producers with generating capacity greater than 90 megawatts (MW) \nthat utilize conventional energy such as coal and natural gas as fuel. IPPs sell their generation \nto EGAT through PPAs with terms of up to 25 years.1 Thailand\u2019s IPP program was introduced in \nthe early 1990s to promote competition, enhance efficiency, lower electricity prices, and reduce \nthe government\u2019s financial burden in expanding generation to meet increasing demand.  \n \n4.  In accordance with the government\u2019s policy to promote private sector participation in the \npower  sector,  EGAT  invited  qualified  generators  in  2007  to  participate  in  the  IPP  bidding \nprocess. This was the second IPP bidding round since the program was initiated and the first \nsince the Asian Financial Crisis.2 The early engagement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwith IPP bidders and its ability to provide long-term financing was critical, as it allowed Gulf JP \nCompany Limited (Gulf JP) to extend its planning horizon, project financial leverage for a longer \nperiod, and bid a lower electricity tariff. Gulf JP\u2019s competitive tariff enabled its two efficient \ncombined cycle natural gas-fired power plants, with combined capacity of 3,200 MW, to contend \nwith proposals of other low-cost generators that use coal as the primary source of fuel.   \n                                                \n1 IPPs are common PPPs for power generation. Under the IPP model, a private sector developer finances, \nconstructs, operates, and maintains the power plant. Power is sold to the government offtaker. In this case, EGAT \nis the state-owned utility that owns and operates the majority of Thailand\u2019s electricity generation as well as the \ncountry\u2019s transmission network. EGAT is Thailand\u2019s principal off-taker and performs the function of system \noperator. EGAT receives sovereign support from the Thai government. Through long term, 25-year, take-or-pay \nPPAs, demand risk and fuel-price risk are eliminated for the IPP operator, thus permitting a lower financing cost. \nThis further guarantees stability to private sector participants in the power sector. \n2  In the first IPP bidding round, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided assistance to BLCP Power Limited. \nSee ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans and a \nProposed Political Risk Guarantee to BLCP Power Limited. Manila. The project comprised a 1,434 MW coal-fired \npower plant located in Rayong Province, about 200 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The plant was completed on \n1 February 2007, ahead of schedule, and generates electricity at one of the lowest costs in Thailand.    ", "2   \n5.  ADB financed the first Gulf JP 1,600 MW IPP (Nong Saeng)3 and has been closely \ninvolved in the financing of the remaining 1,600 MW since 2007. ADB\u2019s continuing support is \ncrucial to ensure implementation of the second 1,600 MW given current difficulty in securing \nlong-term US dollar financing and the project\u2019s sustained need for long-term private sector \nfinancing. The project will complete the implementation of the 3,200 MW capacity secured by \nGulf JP in the 2007 IPP solicitation and the new capacity will arrive at a critical time. Power \ndemand  continued  to  grow  in  20124  and  the  latest  forecasts  indicate  impending  supply \nconstraints toward the end of the decade.5 The project\u2019s addition of 1,600 MW of capacity will \nhelp Thailand maintain a reserve margin above the Ministry of Energy\u2019s critical threshold of \n15%.  The  marked  increase  in  installed  fcapacity  offered  by  the  full  Gulf  JP  3,200  MW \ncontribution promotes the stability of overall power supply and broad economic growth.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n2.  The Borrower and Sponsor \n6.  GUT is a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Thailand to develop, own, and operate \nthe  project. GUT  is  a subsidiary  of the  sponsor,  which  is  majority-owned  by  JP  Holdings \nThailand, the Thai subsidiary of J-POWER. The sponsor also owns the other 1,600 MW gas-\nfired IPP project selected in the 2007 IPP solicitation (Nong Saeng) that was financed by ADB. \n \n7.  J-POWER supplies electricity to 10 major electric power companies in Japan. It also \nparticipates  in  more  than  327  power  projects  in  64  countries  around  the  world.  It  was \nestablished in 1952 as a special public corporation, was fully privatized in 2004, and is listed on \nthe  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange.  Table  1  summarizes  J-POWER\u2019s  financial  and  operational \nperformance in recent years. Reflecting the nature of its steady business, revenues remained \nrelatively  stable  despite  the  recent  economic  crisis.  In  terms  of  overall  creditworthiness, \nJ-POWER\u2019s long-term rating remains high (para. 6).  \n8.  With  over  17%  of  its  generation  capacity  overseas,  J-POWER  considers  overseas \ngeneration to be its next major business domain and seeks to leverage 50 years of generation \nexpertise and experience to compete successfully for IPP projects abroad.6 J-POWER has a \nstake in 28 currently-operating IPP projects in the People\u2019s Republic of China; the Philippines; \nPoland; Taipei,China; Thailand; the United States; and Viet Nam\u2014with a total capacity of over \n14,399 MW.7 Opportunities in Asia for IPP projects are increasing as electricity demand grows \nrapidly throughout the region. J-POWER made the strategic decision to enter the Thai market \nby  partnering  with  local  companies  to  develop,  manage,  and  own  generation  assets.                  \nJ-POWER\u2019s operating power projects in Thailand are listed in Table 2.8 \n \n \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2011.

Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  Impact. The project will improve the reliability of Thailand\u2019s power supply and increase \nconfidence in the use of PPPs in the power sector. The successful conclusion of the IPP bidding \nround and the financial close and operation of a large-scale PPP will signal growing stability to \nthe market. A major challenge for developing member countries such as Thailand is the need to \nbring  significant  new  sources  of  power  generation  online  to  maintain  economic  growth. \nUnderinvestment in the power sector reduces the integrity of the system as it becomes more \nprone to power outages. Supply disruptions are costly for local businesses and discourage \nforeign direct investment. \n \n10.  Outcome. The outcome will be the provision of competitively priced and lower cost \npower generated from gas-fired technology, which emits substantially less carbon dioxide than \ncoal-fired generation. The utilization of natural gas with combined cycle technology contributes \nto  long-term  sustainable  growth  through  its  higher  efficiencies.9  Compared  with  coal-fired \ngeneration, the only IPP alternative for domestic base-load generation in Thailand, the project \nwill avoid more than 3.8 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions per annum, as well as dust and \nash waste. Cleaner air and a lower carbon footprint provide healthier and more sustainable \nliving conditions for central Thailand. Modern forms of energy must be available and affordable \nto communities, businesses, and households to reduce poverty and set development on an \ninclusive path. The project\u2019s greater efficiency and low tariff promotes greater accessibility of \npower to the poor through lower electricity prices. \n \n                                                \n9  The project\u2019s net efficiency is 57.7%, using one of the industry\u2019s most efficient, commercially proven technologies. \n ", "4   \n11.  Output. The output will involve the successful commissioning of a large 1,600 MW IPP \npower plant. The commissioning of the plant will also mark the conclusion of the first IPP \nbidding round launched since the global financial crisis, bolstering confidence in Thailand as it \nrecovers from flood-related economic slowdown and pursues economic development under \nuncertain  global  market  conditions.  The  financial  close  will  be  made  possible  through  the \npresence  of  ADB  and  the  bilateral  co-lender\u2014  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation \n(JBIC),10 which will secure the long-term financing required for infrastructure assets.11  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n12.  Consistency with Strategy 2020. The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 \nwhich  emphasizes  support  for  achieving  poverty  reduction  and  inclusive  growth  through \nenvironmentally sustainable development and private sector development.12 Capitalizing on \nADB\u2019s core strength of financing infrastructure, the strategy sets forth that ADB will help expand \nthe  supply  of  energy;  promote  energy  efficiency;  support  clean  energy;  and  facilitate  the \nremoval of policy, institutional, regulatory, technological, and legal constraints in promoting \nefficient energy use. The strategy also aims to promote a larger role for the private sector in \nfinancing infrastructure by supporting PPP initiatives. \n \n13.  Consistency with Country Strategy. The project is consistent with the latest country \npartnership strategy for Thailand, 2007-2011, as well as the country operations business plan \n2012-2014,  both  of  which  target  three  core  strategic  areas\u2014infrastructure,  environmental \nsustainability, and capital markets.13 Thailand prioritizes infrastructure development to enhance \nits  competitiveness  and  support  long-term  growth.  The  government\u2019s  core  challenge  is  to \nensure that public resources are used efficiently and effectively. To achieve this, PPP models \nare being promoted as a means to reduce the financial burden, promote new technology, \nensure timely construction, and achieve operational efficiencies. Catalyzing investment in the \npower  sector  has  been  identified  as  one  of  the  key  opportunities  for  ADB  private  sector \nassistance. The new draft country partnership strategy also affirms ADB\u2019s role in PPPs and the \npower sector.  \n \n14.  Consistency with Sector Strategy and Relevant ADB Operations. The project is \nconsistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy,14  which  gives  emphasis  to  investments  in  energy \nefficiency, least-cost supply, private sector participation, and wider access to the poor. ADB \nsupports projects that utilize efficient technologies such as combined cycle and projects that \nincorporate state-of-the-art emission control equipment. In addition, natural gas is a preferred \nsource of fuel for providing base-load electricity over coal. The energy policy also supports PPP \nmodels that  enable the  participation  of the  private  sector to  help  achieve  efficiencies  and \nalleviate pressure on public sector funds. Passing on the efficiencies to the consumer, these \nmodels help diminish financial constraints, increase the affordability of electricity for the poor, \nand contribute to poverty reduction through their broader support for economic growth. \n \n15.  Previous Operations. In 2003, ADB approved financing for the BLCP Power Project \n(footnote 1), a successful conventional power plant in Thailand under the IPP program. In 2009, \n                                                \n10 JBIC is processing a loan in parallel to ADB and its participation is subject to JBIC internal approvals. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n12  ADB. 2008.
