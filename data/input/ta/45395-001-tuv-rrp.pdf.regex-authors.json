I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Tuvalu for the Strengthened Public Financial Management Program. \n \n2.  The program is designed to support the medium-term fiscal framework and multiyear \npolicy reform matrix of the Government of Tuvalu by developing policies and processes to \nimprove its capacity for fiscal management.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tuvalu is an extremely small and remote island country. Its land area of 26 square \nkilometers (km2) covers nine coral atolls and reef islands that are spread across more than \n900,000 km2 of the Pacific Ocean. More than half of its approximately 11,000 people reside \non the 2.8 km2 island of Fongafale in the Funafuti Atoll. Tuvalu has no known mineral resources \nand few  exports. It  is almost  entirely  dependent  on  external  aid  and  revenues  to finance \nessential food and fuel imports. The government generates 88% of all economic activity and few \nopportunities exist for private sector development.2 \n \n4.  Given the government\u2019s dominant role, sound management of public finance is critical to \nthe  country\u2019s  economic  performance.  The  government\u2019s  revenue  base  is  narrow  and \nsignificantly exposed to external variables. Revenues come mainly from the real income of the \ndevelopment partner-financed Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF), fishing license fees, licensing royalties \nfor the commercial use of the country\u2019s top-level domain (.tv), and grants.3 Receipts from fishing \nlicenses and domain use fees account for around 40% of total revenue. Import duties and \nexcise and other trade taxes account for only 10% of total revenue and are unlikely to become a \ngreater source of revenue in the medium term due to Tuvalu\u2019s commitment to free trade terms \nunder the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement.4 Government revenue is difficult to predict \naccurately and is often highly volatile. Revenues from the TTF have helped to smooth the flow \nof revenues to the government from year to year. \n \n5.  The TTF, which was established in 1987 to contribute to the long-term financial viability \nof Tuvalu, provides an additional source of revenue for recurrent government expenditures. The \nTTF  was  initially  capitalized  with  A$27.1  million  in  contributions from  several  development \npartners, including Australia (A$8.0 million) and New Zealand (A$8.3 million). As of 31 March \n2012, the trust fund\u2019s market value stood at A$122.9 million, or around 3.5 times Tuvalu\u2019s 2011 \ngross domestic product (GDP). The trust fund aims to generate a real annual rate of return of \n4.5%, which is calculated using Australia\u2019s consumer price index. In years when the market \nvalue of the trust fund exceeds its real maintained value, the surplus is transferred to the \nConsolidated Investment Fund (CIF) within the government\u2019s Consolidated Fund (its main bank \naccount) and invested in a mix of cash and fixed interest securities. The CIF also serves as a \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2012. Tuvalu: 2012 Article IV Consultation. Staff report. Washington, DC. \n3  The top-level country code internet domain for Tuvalu (.tv) is operated by dotTV, a company in the United States. \nThe Government of Tuvalu owns 20% of dotTV and receives a quarterly payment of $1 million for the use of the \ndomain. \n4  In May 2010, Tuvalu announced that it would become the seventh country in the Pacific region to begin trading \nunder the Pacific Island Countries Trade Agreement. On 1 July 2010, the government reduced duty rates in \naccordance with the free trade agreement\u2019s requirements. ", "2 \nrepository for windfall revenues, such as those generated from the lease of the use of the .tv \ninternet domain and from fishing license fees, and acts as a revenue stability mechanism. \nWithdrawals  from  the  CIF  are  used  to  fund  the  recurrent  budget  as  well  as  capital \nreinvestments. The CIF contributed around 15% of each of the annual government budgets \nduring 1990\u20132008. \n \n6.  Because its returns have fallen short of the target in recent years, the TTF has not \nadded to the CIF since 2008. Given ongoing low returns in the markets in which the TTF can \ninvest, contributions to the CIF are unlikely to begin again until 2014. By this time the slight \nrecovery in the value of the trust fund in 2012 and the shift in portfolio strategy, from static \nbenchmark-matching to dynamic targeting of risk and return, is expected to push its returns \nabove its maintained value. Despite strong efforts by the government to contain the deficit in \n2011 and modest deficit forecasts for 2012\u20132014, the government needs to rebuild the CIF to \nhelp smooth volatile revenue flows and provide a fiscal buffer in the event of shocks. This is \nparticularly important given global economic uncertainty and the fact that GDP growth in Tuvalu \nis expected to be only 1.4% in 2012 and 1.3% in 2013.  \n \n7.  The economy expanded by a real annual rate of only 2.4% per annum during 2007\u2013\n2011 and Tuvalu\u2019s growth outlook remains subdued. The country has recovered only slowly \nfrom the global economic crisis, which reduced the value of the TTF at the same time as \ngovernment\u2019s cash reserves in the CIF were being drained through high spending. Falling \nremittances due to the decline in seafarer employment abroad during the global crisis hurt \nhousehold incomes. An unfavorable foreign exchange trend has aggravated these problems. \nTuvalu\u2019s currency, the Australian dollar, has strengthened against the US dollar, which is the \ncurrency  in  which  the  earnings  of  the  country\u2019s  international  seafarers  and  much  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s income are dominated.5 \n \n8.  Tuvalu\u2019s growth strategy is set out in its National Strategy for Sustainable Development, \n2005\u20132015. 6The  strategy  recognizes  that  strengthening  public  sector  management  and \nimproving the private sector environment are key drivers for change in Tuvalu. This is consistent \nwith the focus put on these goals by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Pacific Approach as \nwell as ADB\u2019s country operations business plan.7 Developing effective fiscal management to \ncomplement private sector development has been a long-standing goal of ADB support to \nTuvalu. \n \n1.  Government\u2019s Policy Reform Matrix for Budget Support \n9.  In consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the government developed a \nmedium-term fiscal framework in June 2012 to insulate its fiscal position from revenue volatility \nand global shocks and maintain fiscal sustainability (see table). The fiscal framework was based \non the government\u2019s multiyear policy reform matrix (PRM), prepared in March 2012 with the \ncollaboration of ADB, the governments of Australia and New Zealand, and the World Bank. \nSubsequently, the projected budget outturn for 2012 reflects both planned expenditure cuts and \nalso increased grants.8  \n \n                                                \n5  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management; and Country Economic Indicators (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Government of Tuvalu. 2005.

The PRM has four main areas: governance, social development, education and human \nresources, and macroeconomic growth and stability. In March 2012, Tuvalu\u2019s development \npartners agreed to help implement the PRM through a series of budget support operations, as \nwell as through coordinated policy dialogue and supervision; technical assistance (TA); and, in \nthe case of Australia and New Zealand, increased scholarship awards. Implementing the PRM \nwill help ease the government\u2019s fiscal constraints by boosting economic growth, improving tax \ncollections, reducing nonpriority expenditures, and unlocking additional budget support (footnote \n2). \n \n11.  The PRM aims to establish a framework to make the budget sustainable and to keep the \nbudget  deficit  below  10%  of  GDP  during  2012\u20132014.  This  is  to  be  accomplished  by \nstrengthening fiscal controls, making budgeting and budget execution more effective, improving \nservice  delivery,  protecting  essential  social  services,  reforming  the  government\u2019s  public \nenterprises  (which  include  all  areas  of  government  operations  that  have  business-like \ncharacteristics, including government corporations), and increasing revenue mobilization. When \nthese reforms have been properly accomplished, Tuvalu\u2019s development partners will provide the \nbudget support that will enable the government to rebuild its reserves in the CIF (para. 6). \n \n12.  The government and its development partners appreciate that this must be a carefully \nsequenced  incremental  process.  ADB,  Australia,  New  Zealand,  and  the World  Bank  have \nagreed to provide financial and technical support for a government-led reform program. ADB will \nfinance reform measures in the first phase of the PRM for 2012. This will include identifying \nmore steps to strengthen fiscal management. The governments of Australia and New Zealand \nand the World Bank have agreed to link their provision of budget support in 2013 to the ongoing \nimplementation of these reform measures. \n \n13.  To restore fiscal sustainability, strong measures will also be needed to boost revenues. \nIn 2012, the government increased the Tuvalu consumption tax (TCT) rate from 3% to 4% and \nmade a greater effort to collect delinquent taxes. The 2012 budget also introduced measures to \nbring  large  public  enterprises,  particularly  the  Tuvalu  Electricity  Corporation,  the  Tuvalu \nTelecom Corporation, and the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel (VLH), that are not paying consumption tax \nunder the TCT net. The government is to increase the TCT rate to 7% in 2013 and to 10% by \n ", "4 \n2015. To maintain competitiveness and help broaden the tax base, the government will also \ntake steps to lower income tax rates. \n \n14.  Expenditures are being restrained by reducing entitlements and containing recurrent \ncosts. The government has halted allocations for government-funded scholarships and reduced \nthe accommodation component of the government-funded overseas medical treatment scheme. \nSpecial development expenditures, which are mainly capital projects for such things as boat \nramps  and  jetties  in  the  outer  island,  have  been  scaled  back.  Other  measures  that  the \ngovernment  is  considering  include  a  freeze  in  real  government  wages  in  2013  and \nimplementation of additional cost-reduction measures for the medical treatment and scholarship \nschemes. \n \n15.  These measures will be complemented by critically needed reforms in the government\u2019s \neight public enterprises, which dominate the country\u2019s commercial landscape.9 Only two of them \nreported profits in 2011\u2014the National Bank of Tuvalu and the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation. \nMost are not only loss-making\u2014and thus a burden on the government budget\u2014but also provide \nsubstandard service.  \n \n2.  Fiscal Policy and Management Capacity Issues \n \n16.  Tuvalu has a relatively strong annual budget formulation process and the government \ncan achieve fiscal discipline and effective strategic allocation of resources if it adheres to its \nmedium-term fiscal framework.10 However, government budgeting is weak on credibility and \npredictability and budget execution is poor. This means that deficits can suddenly increase and \nthat spending agencies lack the timely, accurate financial information they need to manage their \nactivities effectively. Efficient service delivery is also undermined by the lack of a government-\nwide  policy  and  regulatory framework for  procurement. The  current  practice  of  purchasing \ngoods and services through established suppliers provides no guarantees that the government \nis getting value for its money. The tender process for works contracts, under the Public Tenders \nBoard regulations, lacks all the checks and balances needed to ensure that procurement is \ncompetitive and transparent.11   \n \n3.  Public Enterprise Reform Issues \n17.  ADB\u2019s  first  policy-based  program  in  Tuvalu\u2014the  Improved  Financial  Management \nProgram\u2014was  instrumental  in  addressing  weaknesses  in  government  oversight  of  public \nenterprises.12 The  program  built  on  previous  ADB  support  for  public  sector  management, \nincluding the TA for capacity development for public financial management, which supported the \ngovernment\u2019s  efforts  to  implement  its  public  enterprise  reform  program.13 It  contributed  to \ngovernment approval of a Public Enterprise Reform Policy in 2009 and enactment of the Public \n                                                \n9  Tuvalu\u2019s public enterprises are the National Bank of Tuvalu, the Development Bank of Tuvalu, the National Fishing \nCompany of Tuvalu, the Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation, the Vaiaku Lagi Hotel, the Tuvalu Electricity \nCorporation, the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute, and the Tuvalu Philatelic Bureau. \n10 Tuvalu has been classified as fragile situation since 2008. The 2012 country performance assessment highlights \neconomic management, in particular debt policy, and structural policies, in particular the financial sector and \nbusiness regulatory environment, as being particularly weak. \n11  Government of Tuvalu. 2011.

However, it was found that such reforms in Tuvalu can \ntake longer to achieve than is initially expected. Due to the tight fiscal situation and a high \nturnover  of  skilled  and  experienced  staff,  the  government  made  less  progress  than  ADB \nenvisaged  in  follow-on  actions  on  reforms,  such  as  the  operationalization  of  a  debt  risk \nmanagement and mitigation policy and the appointment of a banking commissioner.14 The \nnationalization of the electricity corporation in November 2011 was also a setback to public \nenterprise reform although the Tuvalu Electricity Corporation (Repeal) Act 2011 will not be put \ninto effect. \n \n18.  The overall design of the program is based on ADB\u2019s experiences with the Improved \nFinancial Management Program in Tuvalu and policy-based lending programs in the Pacific \nmore generally.  The  lessons from  these  activities  emphasize  the  importance  of  promoting \ncountry ownership by ensuring that such programs (i) are realistic, relatively simple in scope, \nand well within a country\u2019s capacities; (ii) embody a long-term perspective and commitment so \nthat each program is seen as the next step in a sequenced reform process; and (iii) promote \nstrong development partner collaboration through dialogue and the coordination of missions and \nTA support.15 This design approach is also consistent with advice received from the IMF, as \nwell as lessons from ADB\u2019s special evaluation on promoting good governance in the Pacific.16 \nFor these reasons, the Program will be a single-tranche operation that will require all necessary \npolicy actions are accomplished in advance of grant effectiveness. This will ensure that all the \nPRM reform measures earmarked for implementation in 2012\u2014which are all essential building \nblocks for the reform actions to be supported by Australia, New Zealand, and other development \npartners in 2013 and 2014\u2014are accomplished before effectiveness.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The impact will be the achievement of fiscal sustainability of the Tuvalu government. \nThis is a priority of the National Strategy for Sustainable Development and exemplified by the \nreform measures in the PRM. The impact will be measured against specific fiscal targets in \nTuvalu\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework and verified by regular IMF staff missions and IMF \nArticle IV consultation reports. The outcome will be improved fiscal management capacity. This \nwill be reflected in improved fiscal management capacity in the event of shocks. \n \nC.  Outputs \n20.  The program is structured around PRM objectives in the government\u2019s national plan to \nexercise  sound  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  management,  exert  fiscal  discipline  so  that \ngovernment budgets are fiscally sustainable, and strengthen and improve public enterprise \nmanagement. To achieve these objectives, the Program focused on the achievement of three \noutputs in 2012. \n \n21.  Output  1:  Improved  fiscal  management  policy.  The  program  supported  the \nfinalization of a PFM reform road map and a procurement policy. \n \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2011.

It has improved the government\u2019s capacity to manage \ncritical PFM reforms strategically and cohesively by prioritizing and sequencing reform actions \nproperly and coordinating development partner support. The road map was developed with \nsupport  from  the  Pacific  Financial  Technical  Assistance  Centre  and  approved  by  the \ngovernment cabinet on 27 July 2012. The government has already begun implementing some \nelements of the road map: an annual budget calendar has been published; cash reconciliations \nare now being completed on a monthly basis; and public accounts have been brought up-to-\ndate, with 2009\u20132011 accounts having been audited. \n \n23.  The procurement policy has clarified and strengthened regulatory requirements and \nimproved incentives in the public procurement process for competition, value for money, and \naccountability through strengthening of tender and procurement procedures. The policy was \ndeveloped by the Attorney General\u2019s Office with support from ADB and the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  and  was  approved  by  the  cabinet  on  25  October \n2012.17 A draft of the procurement policy was provided to ADB for review prior to finalization to \nensure that all necessary fiduciary requirements were met, in accordance with international best \npractice. \n \n24.  Output  2:  Improved  fiscal  management  processes.  The  program  supported  the \nidentification and development of fiscal ratios, which are practical management tools to maintain \nfiscal aggregates within agreed bounds. \n \n25.  The use of the ratios to set fiscal management targets will complement the principles of \nfiscal  responsibility  contained  in  Tuvalu\u2019s  Public  Finance  Ordinance  1982  and  Financial \nInstructions 1990 and will build on the budget benchmark performance criteria previously used \nby Australia and New Zealand as incentives for budget support. The ratios include targets for \ndomestic  revenue,  domestic  expenditure,  personnel  costs,  and  government  borrowing  as \nproportions of GDP. They have been developed with support from ADB and were approved by \nthe cabinet  on  19  July  2012. The ratios  were  used to guide the  preparation  of the  2013 \nbudget.18 \n \n26.  Output  2  is  expected  to  improve  Tuvalu\u2019s  budgetary  position  by  strengthening  the \ngovernment\u2019s ability to track budget performance on a quarterly basis and to measure this \nperformance against its medium-term fiscal projections. This will allow it to take any corrective \naction necessary in a timely manner. \n \n27.  Output  3:  Selected  public  enterprise  rationalization. The  program facilitated  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to advance its rationalization plans for the VLH, the Tuvalu Philatelic \nBureau (TPB), the Tuvalu Post Office (TPO), and the Tuvalu Travel Office (TTO). This included \nthe approval of a draft management contract for the hotel and the merging of the TPB, the TPO, \nand the TTO, which are retail businesses. \n \n28.  The hotel has performed poorly in financial terms from 2004 to 2011. A scoping study \nundertaken with ADB TA in 2011 recommended that the VLH be sold through an international \ntender process. As a transitional arrangement, the government has opted to contract the hotel\u2019s \n                                                \n17 ADB. 2012.

ADB TA (footnote 15) helped to ensure that all \nsupporting documents such as the draft management contract were prepared and approved by \nthe cabinet.19 Cabinet approved the draft management contract and the advertisement for \ninvitation to tender on 26 October 2012. \n \n30.  The merger of the TPB, the TPO, and the TTO into one entity\u2014called Tuvalu Post and \nTravel\u2014will help cut the operating costs of, and subsidies for, these public enterprises and \nreduce  the  government\u2019s  fiscal  losses.  All  three  of  the  retail  operations  are  encountering \nincreasingly stiff competition, that is, from newer technology, including email, telephone calls \nand travel bookings conducted over the internet. ADB TA (footnote 15) helped the government \nbegin the merger through cabinet approval of the transfer of its shares in TPB and of the assets \nand liabilities of TPO and TTO to Tuvalu Post and Travel at an agreed price and with all \nnecessary documentation completed. Cabinet approved the merger on 26 October 2012. \n \n31.  Output 3 will contribute to fiscal sustainability. Reform of these public enterprises will \nfree resources that can be used more effectively in other priority budget areas. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs  \n \n32.  The program is estimated to cost $5.2 million. \n \n33.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $2.35 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the program.  \n \n34.  ADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  $2.35  million  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements, the cost of the government\u2019s reform efforts, and the importance of rebuilding the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal buffer in the CIF. While this is not a cofinancing arrangement, this effort will \nbe part of a joint undertaking with other development partners. Australia has pledged A$500,000 \nand New Zealand NZ$400,000 ($326,623) for the 2012 financial year, while the World Bank has \nindicated that it will consider providing budget support for 2013 and 2014. Projections of budget \nfinancing requirements indicate a fiscal deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2012, equivalent to A$14.9 \nmillion, without grant support from development partners.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n35.  Program management. The MFED will be the executing agency and will oversee and \ncoordinate timely implementation of the agreed policy actions (paras. 21\u201331). The implementing \nagencies will be the MFED\u2019s public enterprise monitoring unit; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, \nEnvironment, Trade, Labour and Tourism; and the Ministry of Transport and Communication. \nEach  will  be  responsible for  undertaking  the  policy  actions  or  program  activities  under  its \nresponsibilities. Ongoing TA will help the government fulfill program conditions (footnote 15). \nThe  MFED  will  also  be  responsible  for  program  administration,  disbursements,  and \n                                                \n19 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase 2. Manila. (TA 7430-\nREG, for $3,000,000, approved on 10 December). \n ", "8 \nmaintenance of all program records. ADB and other development partners supporting the PRM \nprocess will help the government set up a high-level coordination and monitoring mechanism. It \nwill  be  made  up  of  the  members  of  the  TTF  advisory  committee\u2014representatives  of  the \ngovernment and of AusAID and New Zealand Aid Program\u2014and will monitor progress and \noversee the implementation of the program and the activities of the MFED. \n \n36.  Implementation period. The program will be implemented from 31 March 2012 to 31 \nDecember 2013, consistent with the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework. Policy and \noperational changes agreed with the government and set out in the policy matrix will be put in \nplace from 31 March 2012 to 29 October 2012. \n \n37.  Procurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.20 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources. 21 Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Tuvalu, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is equal to or greater than the \namount of the grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to \naudit the use of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n38.  Tranches. The grant will be provided in a single tranche and will be disbursed upon \nsatisfaction of grant effectiveness conditions\u2014that is, fulfillment of all the actions in the program \npolicy matrix. All policy actions have been accomplished. \n \n39.  Counterpart funds. Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to the \ngovernment\u2019s  bank  account  with  the  National  Bank  of  Tuvalu  to  allow  provision  of \nsupplementary financing for the 2012 budget. \n \n40.  Program  performance  monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  MFED  will  establish  a \nperformance evaluation system for the program within 3 months from grant effectiveness and \nmaintain this. Using this system, the MFED will monitor the program and report to ADB on the \nimplementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with the program \nimpact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. Because the impact of the \nProgram will be felt beyond the period of its implementation, the MFED will continue monitoring \nuntil the beginning of 2014. The information will be included in the program completion report. \nThis monitoring of the outcome and impact will also be useful to the government\u2019s ongoing \nreform processes and PFM decision making. \n  \n41.  Program review. The government shall undertake periodic reviews every 3 months \nduring program implementation period to evaluate the scope, implementation arrangements, \nprogress and achievement of the objectives of the program. In addition to the periodic reviews, \na mid-term review shall take place during the first quarter of 2013. The government will ensure \nthat ADB shall have the opportunity to participate in these reviews. \n \n                                                \n20 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n21 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n42.  The program\u2019s major benefit will be its contribution to the Tuvalu government\u2019s long-term \nfiscal sustainability. Fiscal sustainability will in turn help restore macroeconomic stability in the \ncountry  and  boost  growth.  Strengthened  PFM  will  also  improve  service  delivery,  which  is \nessential to making the growth process inclusive and to fostering employment and poverty \nreduction. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n43.  Improving the government\u2019s spending allocation decisions and reducing the demand on \nthe budget made by public enterprises will create fiscal space and allow the government to shift \nexpenditures to priority areas. Tuvalu\u2019s overall fiscal performance will thereby improve. Budget \nrestraint and strengthened fiscal management will allow the government to rebuild its external \nrevenue cushion and reduce its vulnerability to fiscal shocks. The program\u2019s long-term impact \nwill be greater government capacity for fiscal management, which will help bring the budget \ndeficit below the target of 10% of GDP. \n \nB.  Governance \n44.  The  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \nprogram.  The  2011  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  assessment  for  Tuvalu \n(footnote 11) identified the areas of weaknesses in government budgeting processes. The \nsubsequent implementation of the PFM reform roadmap\u2014and, more broadly, the emphasis on \nimproving  public  financial  management  in  the  PRM\u2014demonstrates  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment to managing the budget credibly and effectively.22 \n \n45.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  the  MFEM.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the grant agreement. \n  \nC.  Poverty and Social \n46.  Improved PFM will have positive impacts on the delivery of social services. In the near \nterm, rationalization of the state enterprises could lead to modest job losses. A clear transition \nschedule for redundancy will be accompanied by retraining or compensation to avert adverse \nsocial impacts and will be supported by ADB and other development partners. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n47.  Program activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms and none of the \nactivities  will  result  in,  or  lead  to,  involuntary  resettlement  or  affect  indigenous  people. \nSafeguard categories for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples are all \nC. No adverse environmental impacts have been identified. Public consultation has been carried \nout during the processing of the program and fact finding. \n                                                \n22  Further assessment is available in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n48.  The program faces three key risks:  \n \n(i)  The narrow economic base leaves the country vulnerable to shocks. Should \nthese  occur,  the  reform  focus  would  likely  switch  from  strengthening  public \nfinancial management to short-term stabilization. \n(ii)  The political consensus needed to mount program reforms could prove difficult to \nmaintain, particularly for public enterprise reforms.  \n(iii)  Capacity constraints and staff turnover could limit the government\u2019s ability to \nmanage the program. \n \n49.  The program design mitigates these risks. The rebuilding of fiscal reserves will help the \ngovernment weather potential external shocks. Political consensus has been reinforced through \nthe government\u2019s ownership and leadership of the PRM process and the subsequent reform \neffort. In addition, MFED with support from ADB TA (footnote 15) have conducted a concerted \noutreach  program  to  build  wider  support  for  reform  among  parliamentarians  and  in  the \ncommunity. Capacity constraints will be offset in part through new and ongoing TA provided by \nADB and other partners. To mitigate the risk of overburdening institutions, the PRM presents a \ncontinuance of reforms that have been under preparation since 2009. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n50.  The government and the MFED have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the grant document. \n \n51.  The government and the MFED have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB \nis satisfied that all conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy \nmatrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the grant agreement, have been complied \nwith.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n52.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard  approve  the  grant  not  exceeding  $2,350,000  to  Tuvalu  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources for the Strengthened Public Financial Management Program, on terms and conditions \nthat are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented \nto the Board. \n \nBindu N.
