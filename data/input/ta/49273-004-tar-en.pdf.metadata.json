The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide additional financing of $166.25 million to \nthe ongoing Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SMEs) Line of Credit Project in the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka under the proposed project. The additional financing will comprise \n(i) a $45 million ADB loan to support targeted underserved SMEs (SME component), (ii) a \n$20 million ADB loan to support tea smallholders and a $1.25 million attached project grant \nprovided  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  (pilot  component),1 and  (iii) a \n$100 million ADB loan to provide short-term liquidity support for SMEs in response to the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) (emergency response component).   \n \n2.  In addition, an attached JFPR technical assistance (TA) grant of $1.75 million for value \nchain development for the tea industry will be integral for implementing the pilot component. \n \n3.  The impact and outcome of the current project will be retained. The impact of the overall \nproject will be increased employment opportunities in SMEs. The outcome will be strengthened \nSMEs\u2019 access to finance. The project outputs will be (i) financing to SMEs through formal \nintermediaries increased; (ii) innovative SME financing schemes developed; (iii) capacity of SMEs \nin targeted clusters to access financial services enhanced; (iv) international competitiveness of \nthe information and communication technology\u2013business process outsourcing and tea cluster \nstrengthened; (v) gender-inclusive policy and regulatory framework and support enhanced; and \n(vi) evidence based on women entrepreneurship development to inform future policy making \nstrengthened. The pilot component and JFPR TA will support project outputs 1, 3, and 4.    \n \n4.  Support for tea smallholders. In Sri Lanka, the tea industry has been an important part \nof the socioeconomic fabric, with significant macroeconomic policy implications in terms of \nearning foreign exchange and promoting inclusive economic growth. It accounts for 15% of \nexports and employs 10% of the workforce, most of whom are less educated with chronically low \nwages. Some 75% of tea production depends on more than 400,000 tea smallholders, most of \nwhom have informal family businesses with landholdings of less than 0.4 hectares (1 acre).2 \nDespite  its  brand  recognition,  Sri  Lankan  tea  has  recently  been  losing  its  international \ncompetitiveness because of the declining quality and quantity of tea leaves resulting from aged \ntea bushes and lack of technological upgrading of agricultural practices, including climate change \nadaptation. The current replanting rate of the tea smallholding segment is only 0.7%, while the \nideal rate is 2%\u20133%.3 \n \n5.  Tea smallholders are generally unbanked. Although they are eligible to borrow from the \nongoing ADB SME credit line, only one tea smallholder has done so while tea processing factories \nhave  accessed  it  to  modernize  and  upgrade  their  facilities.4 The  underinvestment  by  tea \nsmallholders in replanting, business upgrading, and other productivity enhancement measures is \ncaused by the following issues: (i) their limited access to formal long-term financing; (ii) their \n \n1  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report \nand recommendation to the President). \n2  Following the definition of smallholding by the Ministry of Plantation, tea growers with a landholding not exceeding \n20.2 hectares (50 acres) are considered tea smallholders.  \n3  Replanting takes 2\u20133 years for soil rehabilitation before planting. Tea plants take 18\u201336 months after planting to start \nyielding pluckable tea. Thereafter, productivity follows a continuous parabolic curve, growing to yield the highest crop \ntypically around the age of 8 years. Yield stays fairly stable until the age of 40\u201350 years, then productivity starts \ndeclining rapidly. To match this yield curve, a long-term loan with sufficient grace period is needed for replanting.  \n4  The only subloan provided to the tea smallholding segment for new planting and replanting was blended with the \nWomen Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative grant. For the tea factory segment, 22 tea factories employing 3,736 people \nhad borrowed around $2.7 million under ADB\u2019s credit line as of April 2019. \n ", "2 \nlimited access to training, knowledge of good agricultural practices, technology, and market \ninformation;  and  (iii) ineffective  policy  frameworks  to  strengthen  the  industry\u2019s  international \ncompetitiveness.5  \n \n6.  The attached JFPR project grant will financially support marginal tea smallholders with \nlandholdings of less than 4 hectares (10 acres) to access bank financing for replanting and new \nplanting, by providing 10%\u201320% principal paydown to subloans under the pilot component to \ndirectly address issue 1 (tea smallholders\u2019 limited access to formal long-term finance). The \nattached JFPR TA will provide capacity enhancement for key stakeholders along the tea value \nchain to develop an enabling environment for addressing issues 1\u20133 and to strengthen the \ninternational competitiveness of the Sri Lankan tea industry.   \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  The new $1.75 million JFPR TA will support the measures to improve tea smallholders\u2019 \nproductivity and international competitiveness. This will mitigate the demand risk for the pilot \ncomponent during project implementation and lay a foundation for sustainable development of \nthe tea industry beyond the project implementation period. This transaction TA is listed in the \ncurrent country operations business plan.6 The government confirmed this transaction TA through \nan aide-m\u00e9moire in February 2020.   \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Improving tea smallholders\u2019 access to finance. This output will promote the \nblended finance under the pilot component by (i) providing financial literacy trainings to tea \nsmallholders  through  tea  societies,  in  cooperation  with  banks,  to  alleviate  the  risk  of  tea \nsmallholders\u2019 overindebtedness from informal lenders; and (ii) supporting participating banks to \ndevelop  a standardized  loan  product  dedicated  to  tea smallholders  to  decrease their  loan \norigination and administrative costs in cooperation with tea factories and tea societies.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Developing a mobile application platform for tea smallholders. A new \nmobile application platform will be launched, on a pilot basis, to provide better access for tea \nsmallholders to extension services, market information, online training, and mentorship programs; \nand easily maintain business and financial records.7 The pilot introduction of simple mobile-based \nservices and their acceptance by users will set the foundation for full-fledged and innovative \nservices  through  smartphones  and/or  tablets,  such  as  product  quality  certification  through \nblockchain technology along with supply chain, artificial intelligence-based extension services \n(e.g., chatbot), banks\u2019 internal scoring of credit to tea smallholders based on their behavioral data, \n \n5  A detailed explanation of the three key issues is in the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and recommendation of the President).      \n6  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Sri Lanka, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 November 2019. \n7  Introductory financial literacy trainings will be provided through tea societies (local community-based apex body) to \ntea smallholders together with banks. ADB consultants recruited under the TA will develop training materials and \nprovide support and supervision for the training delivery with the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority. Follow-\nup content will be uploaded to the mobile application. In terms of mentorship, the mobile application will provide \n(i) more frequent communication with tea inspectors, and (ii) matching services between tea smallholders to learn \nfrom each other on cultivation and access to markets.    \n ", "3 \nand the development of weather index insurance.8 The cost and production data accumulated \nthrough the platform will provide evidence-based information for the government to formulate \nmore targeted policy interventions. \n \n10.  This component will (i) raise awareness of the use of mobile-based services among tea \nsmallholders, (ii) develop mobile application services, (iii) develop implementation arrangements \nto manage services on a sustainable basis, and (iv) evaluate the impact of the mobile-based \napplication service on tea smallholders\u2019 business practices.  \n  \n11.  The mobile application will be developed primarily to meet the needs of tea smallholders, \nbut subscription to the service will not be limited to tea smallholders. Tea factories, brokers, and \nbanks may also benefit from the mobile application to develop stronger market linkages with tea \nsmallholders. The ownership of the mobile platform will be transferred to the government after TA \ncompletion. The development and marketing campaign will be undertaken through participating \ntea factories and lead farmers in selected value chains in selected districts to ensure service \noutreach to tea smallholders in the same value chain. As part of the TA implementation, ADB will \nsupport the government to develop a governance and implementation framework to crowd in \nprivate sector management for installing and developing the mobile application platform on a \nsustainable basis.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Developing  an  enabling  environment  for  a  sustainable  and  gender-\nsensitive tea value chain. This output aims to develop a white paper on sustainable value chain \ndevelopment, focusing on tea smallholders. As Sri Lanka undergoes the transition to middle-\nincome status, labor costs will increase and the Sri Lankan tea industry will need to rebrand itself \nto export-quality tea for targeted segments of international consumers. One possible direction is \nto promote sustainable and gender-sensitive value chain development, with organic and fair-trade \ncertificates  for  tea  smallholders  and  tea  factories.  This  would  allow  them  to  sell  socially \nresponsible products directly to international consumers outside the auction system.9 This policy \nresearch will (i) analyze the existing regulatory, budgetary, and institutional frameworks;10 and \n(ii) propose new policy measures to develop internationally competitive value chains, including \nthe  promotion  of  direct  selling  to  the  international  market  and  women  entrepreneurship \ndevelopment in the tea industry.11       \n \n13.  Output 4: Project monitoring and evaluation. This output will support monitoring and \nevaluation of the pilot component in relation to the SME component. A rigorous impact evaluation \non the effectiveness of the use of the mobile-based extension service and related stakeholder \ndissemination  will  be  carried  out  by  ADB\u2019s  TA.  This  output  will  also  support  the  project \n \n8  C. McIntosh and C. Mansini. 2018. The Use of Financial Technology in the Agriculture Sector. ADBI Working Paper \nSeries. No. 872. Manila.  \n9  The adoption of sustainable farming practices is becoming increasingly important to partner with global value chains, \nas most leading value chain partners and consumers are becoming conscious of environmental sustainability. For \ninstance, Unilever has partnered with the Rainforest Alliance to certify smallholder tea farmers to ensure that all the \ntea sourced by the company is sustainably produced. Some regional plantation companies have already taken steps \nto train and certify their smallholder suppliers on sustainable farming. During the TA implementation, the ADB team \nwill seek inputs from the Rainforest Alliance and other civil society organizations that promote sustainable farming \npractices.  \n10 Institutional gaps identified for extension services by the Tea Small Holdings Development Authority and Sri Lanka \nTea Board will be addressed in the mobile application service.  \n11 The ADB gender gap assessment for the tea smallholder value chain identified potential areas for women to start \nnew businesses, including (i) commercial nurseries, (ii) tea tourism, (iii) employment agencies, and (iv) green leaves \ncollection.    \n ", "4 \nmanagement unit in financial management, environmental and social safeguard management, \nand other project management activities.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.75 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJFPR and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n  \n15.
