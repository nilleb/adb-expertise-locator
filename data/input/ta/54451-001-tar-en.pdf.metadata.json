INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA), Updating the Revised Strategic \nTransport Plan (RSTP) for Dhaka, will help enhance planning capacity and coordination in the \nurban transport sector in the city of Dhaka and support the Road Transport and Highways Division, \nMinistry of Road Transport and Bridges (MORTB), the executing agency, to strengthen its \nplanning capacity. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the country operations business plan of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023. The objectives of the TA are aligned with the plan\u2019s \nstrategic objectives and priorities: (i) to ease infrastructure constraints in key sectors, such as \nenergy, transport, and urban development; and (ii) to address institutional capacity constraints \nand improve governance.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh\u2014together with parts of the adjacent cities and \ndistricts  of  Gazipur,  Manikganj,  Munshiganj,  Narayanganj,  and  Narshindi\u2014constitutes  the \njurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), the authority mandated to plan land use \nand implement urban development projects over an area of 1,528 square kilometers. This wider \narea surrounding Dhaka is the center of Bangladesh\u2019s economic activity, contributing nearly 40% \nof the gross national product, and attracts migrants from other regions of Bangladesh in search of \nbusiness  and  employment  opportunities. 2  Its  population  has  increased  rapidly,  reaching \n15.9 million or about 10% of the country\u2019s entire population in 2011, and is projected to grow \nfurther to 26.3 million by 2035. The city\u2019s population grew 3.9% annually from 2001 to 2011, well \nabove the national growth rate of 1.4%.3 \n4.  Transport challenges in Dhaka. Despite its rapid population and economic growth and \ncorresponding increase in traffic demand, Dhaka still relies heavily on road transport. Of the \n15 million daily trips per day, an estimated 47% are by bus and 14% by car. The number of \nvehicles in Dhaka has increased steadily\u2014about 140,000 vehicles were added in 2017, including \n \nabout 20,000 private cars.4 Traffic volume in Dhaka exceeds the road capacity by 20% on average \n \nduring peak hours, and by more than 100% on particular sections in the city center.5 The bus \nsystem is operated by the publicly owned Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation (BRTC) and \na large number of private operators. Although bus is the predominant mode of public transport in \nDhaka, the bus system is inefficient, unreliable, and unsafe.6 Rail-based public transport is limited \nto Bangladesh Railways within Dhaka, with only two commuter service lines carrying a total of \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Country Operations Business Plan: Bangladesh, 2021\u20132023. Manila. The TA first appeared in the \nbusiness opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 January 2021. \n2  \u201cDhaka\u201d refers to the area under the jurisdiction of the RAJUK because it is the authority responsible for planning \nand regulating land use covering the entire area of Dhaka City. \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority. 2016.

Dhaka. \n5  Based on an assessment from a road assignment model conducted as part of preparation of the current RSTP. Also, \nthe average speed of travel by road is just 6.4 kilometers per hour during morning peak hours. \n6  Major issues affecting bus services in Dhaka include: (i) the network is not well designed to meet demand or ensure \nefficient connections among corridors; (ii) drivers tend to ignore designated routes and stop at locations they chose, \nwhich disrupts traffic flows, creates safety risks, and causes service delays; and (iii) the bus fleets are badly \nmaintained and lack features for elderly, women, children, and disabled persons. The BRTC subcontracts operation \nof its buses to private operators. Reliable information on share of bus ownership is unavailable, but 13,700 buses \nwere registered in the Greater Dhaka Area, with 306 owned by the BRTC based on the RSTP. \n \n ", "2 \nabout 25,000 passengers per day.7 The first mass rapid transit (MRT) network is still under \n \ndevelopment.8 The inadequate supply of transport services is compounded by a lack of growth \nmanagement and consequent rapid, uncontrolled urbanization. Dhaka is among the most densely \npopulated cities in the world, with 11,094 people per square kilometer. The built-up area increased \nby 20% during 1989\u20132010, resulting in a general worsening of living conditions, slum growth, and \nincreased incidence of flash flooding (footnote 3). \n \n5.  The economy of Bangladesh has grown rapidly at an annual average rate of 6.5% \nbetween  2005  and  2019,  and  the  country\u2019s  economic  structure  has  transformed  from  an \nagriculture orientation to value-adding manufacturing and service industries. Dhaka remains the \nindustrial and commercial center, attracting mass migration from other parts of the country, and \nincreasing per capita income is enabling more of its residents to buy cars. The economic loss \ncaused by traffic congestion is estimated at about 7% of gross domestic product.9 There is an \nurgent need to increase the supply of transport services in Dhaka and provide efficient transport \nconnections between Dhaka and the surrounding areas, while controlling the worsening traffic \nproblems within the center in the short-term to enhance the productivity and sustainability of \nBangladesh\u2019s capital. To meet this goal, the government needs to accelerate investment in the \nurban transport sector in Dhaka through efficient urban transport planning and well-integrated \nland development plans. \n \n6.  Institutional and regulatory framework. The institutional and regulatory framework of \nDhaka\u2019s transport sector has undergone reforms to address the need to develop large-scale \ninfrastructure. The Dhaka Transport Coordination Board, established in 2001, was enhanced into \nthe Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA) in 2012. The DTCA is tasked with overseeing \neffective and efficient planning, development, and coordination among the growing number of \ntransport projects, especially the new MRT and bus rapid transit (BRT) systems proposed in the \nRSTP.10 \n \n7.  However, serious challenges remain: (i) the DTCA lacks sufficient staffing to serve as the \napex transport planning agency in Dhaka, and personnel are not adequately trained in urban \ntransport policy formulation or project planning, especially in crucial areas such as transport \nmodeling, traffic engineering, and urban planning;11 (ii) the DTCA struggles to effectively exercise \nits planning and coordination mandate because of its highly polarized structure consisting of a \nlarge number of transport agencies or within RAJUK, and unclear delineation of authority among \nthem, resulting in inconsistency between transport planning and land use planning; 12 and (iii) the \ndecision-making procedure is highly inefficient, with the project screening process taking months \nin the absence of an efficient screening framework. \n \n8.  Government\u2019s urban transport strategy.  The government\u2019s Eighth Five-Year Plan \nprioritizes  addressing  major  institutional  constraints  to  identifying  and  implementing \n \n7  Available commuter railway services (between Dhaka and Narayanganj, and Dhaka and Joydevpur) remain a minor \ntraffic modality in Dhaka mainly because of the limited capacity and number of stations, low frequency and unreliable \ntimetables, and inconvenience of ticketing and intermodal functions. \n8  The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) has been supporting the development of the MRT Line 6, Line \n1, and Line 5 North, through eight loans since 2013. \n9  S. Chakraborty. 2016. Traffic Congestion in Dhaka City and Its Economic Impact. Journal of Business Studies Special \nInternational Edition 2016. University of Dhaka. pp. 45\u201368. \n10 Its mandate also covers overall policy formulation for the public transport systems in Dhaka, licensing regulations, \nroute permits, fare structures, and developing and implementing traffic management and safety plans. \n11 Currently, it has 220 staff positions, of which only 108 are filled. \n12 Key transport agencies with projects in Dhaka include the MORTB, Road and Highways Department, Bangladesh \nRailway, Bangladesh Bridges Authority, and Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority. \n \n ", "3 \ntransformational transport projects that efficiently allocate resources. A top priority in urban \ntransport is reducing traffic congestion and developing an integrated system for supporting \nsustainable urban development.13 In Dhaka, the Dhaka Transport Coordination Board formulated \nthe Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka in 1998 with the assistance of the World Bank. Approved \nby the government in 2005, the plan included an urban transport policy (2004\u20132024), which \nidentified priority issues such as improvement of MRTs, development of urban expressways, and \ninstitutional reforms.14 \n \n9.  Revised Strategic Transport Plan. The government formulated the RSTP in 2016 as an \nurban transport master plan for Dhaka with a 20-year planning horizon, with support from the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). The RSTP intends to ensure mobility and access \nto vital urban services by providing safe and equitable transport systems that use efficient and \nsustainable public transport modes, and are integrated with land use and urban development. \nThe RSTP identifies six distinct public transport corridors with high passenger traffic demand that \nconnect  Dhaka\u2019s  central  business  district  with  surrounding  satellite  regional  centers.  To \naccommodate the projected high demand, the RSTP proposes five MRT lines and two BRT lines \nto be completed by 2035 along those corridors.15 \n \n10.  While the RSTP has provided a clear vision for the sector through the development of \nMRTs, the following limitations are evident following 5 years of implementation: (i) the baseline \nsurvey data and information have gradually become outdated, and the priority project list also \nrequires updating as various agencies plan new projects, some of which may not be fully \nconsistent  with  the  current  RSTP  guiding  policies  or  priorities; (ii)  the  RSTP  gives  limited \nconsideration to multimodal integration that is crucial for improving the efficiency of the overall \nurban transport network; connectivity between intracity and intercity public transport services \nshould also be given more attention to help disperse Dhaka\u2019s population to adjacent regional \ncenters;  and  (iii)  the  RSTP  focuses  heavily  on  physical  infrastructure  solutions  and  lacks \n(a) strong proposals for effective short-term measures to manage or control traffic demand, (b) a \nspecific policy and analysis of opportunities for transit-oriented development and value capture \nfinancing as tools for sustainable infrastructure financing and promoting integrated land and \ntransport planning, and (c) in-depth analysis into public\u2013private partnerships. \n \n11.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030. The TA will contribute to tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability by making \nclimate and disaster resilience the key consideration in the urban transport master plan for the \ncapital of one of the most climate change-affected countries. The TA will also provide training on \nlow carbon transport solutions for Dhaka\u2019s urban transport officials. The TA will also contribute to \nmaking cities more livable by supporting the formulation of an urban transport master plan \nintegrated with land use plans, and thereby promote the well-organized development of Dhaka \nand its adjacent regional centers. Finally, the TA will contribute to strengthening governance and \ninstitutional capacity by assisting the DTCA in planning capacity building programs as well as \nstreamlining the government\u2019s urban transport project screening process. These improvements \nwill help accelerate investments in critical transport infrastructure in a more effective, efficient, \nand accountable manner. \n \n12.

ADB\u2019s new \ncountry partnership  strategy,  2021\u22122025 (currently  under  development)  will  continue  these \nfocuses. ADB has been providing assistance in the (i) construction of the BRT Line 3 (North),17 \nand (ii) development of the MRT Line 5 (Southern Route) through a project preparatory TA that \nhelped fund the prefeasibility study, and ongoing project readiness financing for the detailed \ndesign.18 The ensuing project is anticipated to be financed through a multitranche financing facility, \nand will have a total length of 17.4 kilometers that traverses highly congested central Dhaka from \nGabtoli station in the west to Dasherkandi station in the east. It will connect with MRT Line 1, Line \n5 (North), and Line 6, greatly improving the efficiency and capacity of the MRT network. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: delivery of urban transport services in Dhaka \nimproved and integrated.19 The TA will have the following outcome: planning and programming \nof urban transport services in Dhaka improved.20 To meet the rapidly increasing transport demand \nand promote sustainable urban development in Dhaka, the RSTP as the urban transport master \nplan needs to be immediately updated and used strategically in Dhaka\u2019s transport planning \nprocess. Specifically, potential transport projects need to be aligned with the RSTP\u2019s urban \ntransport policy, and incorporated into the plan to ensure the entire urban transport sector \ninvestment program is efficient. This must become mandatory for all future transport projects in \nDhaka to speed up decision-making regarding sector investments. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Revised Strategic Transport Plan for Dhaka updated. The TA aims to \nupdate the existing transport policies and strategies in Dhaka in light of current challenges and \nnew opportunities to improve transport sector service delivery. The TA also aims to develop an \nupdated and prioritized list of projects to ensure alignment between programming and the updated \nRSTP. The TA will deliver the following: \n(i)  Propose a TA implementation framework for smooth coordination and effective \nincorporation of feedback of agencies in the RSTP updating process, and ensure \nthe technical quality of the update.21 \n(ii)  Review the RSTP and other relevant plans related to land use and transport \ndevelopment in Dhaka and identify key areas in the RSTP in need of updating. \n(iii)  Conduct traffic and public transport surveys and a transport infrastructure inventory \n \n16 ADB. 2016.

Use the model outputs to identify priorities to respond to \nDhaka\u2019s congestion challenges and, accordingly, review and update the urban \ntransport strategy. The focus should be on (a) enforcing a trunk-feeder transport \nnetwork, with the MRTs as the main modality; (b) incorporating the projects not \nincluded in the RSTP; (c) integrating multimodal transport, traffic management \nmeasures, road safety, and informal public transport modes into the RSTP; and \n(d) giving consideration to nonmotorized transit vehicles and pedestrians. \n(vi)  Propose effective use of applicable innovative and digital solutions for improving \ntransport services. \n(vii)  Assess opportunities for transit-oriented development along the alignment of the \nproposed MRTs. \n(viii)  Explore and propose alternative funding options for urban transport projects such \nas public\u2013private partnerships and value capture financing.23 \n(ix)  Review and update the urban transport development road map, with a list of \nindicative projects for each subsector of urban transport. \n(x)  Update the implementation program based on an updated priority project list for \nshort-term, medium-term, and long-term timeframes. \n(xi)  Prepare a list of output requirements for up to three priority projects. \n(xii)  Finalize the updated RSTP covering items (ii)\u2013(xi). \n \n15.  Output 2: Planning capacity in urban transport sector of Dhaka enhanced. The TA \naims to improve the capacity of the urban transport sector in Dhaka, focusing on the DTCA to \nexercise its planning, programming, and coordination functions under the updated RSTP. The TA \nwill also support the review and drafting of a law to accelerate programming and investment \ndecision-making in the sector through enhanced use of the updated RSTP. The TA will undertake \nthe following activities: \n(i)  Identify stakeholder land use planning and transport agencies, and review their \nmandates, functions, organization, and activities. \n(ii)  Review the DTCA\u2019s mandate and functions and propose institutional reforms to \nincrease urban transport planning efficiency, including human resources planning \nand plan enhancement. \n(iii)  Formulate a planning capacity-building program for the DTCA in areas such as \nurban planning, transport modeling, participatory planning, and traffic engineering, \nand conduct such training.24 \n(iv)  Propose a mechanism and/or framework to establish the updated RSTP as a \nproject screening tool for urban transport projects in Dhaka on the basis of the draft \nlaw prepared by the DTCA. \n(v)  Support the DTCA in obtaining  government endorsement for the mechanism \nand/or  framework  in  (iv)  by  assisting  in  the  finalization  of  the  relevant  draft \n \n22 The need for any additional surveys will be assessed and determined considering requirements of modeling, the \ntimeframe, and budget. \n23 The support for value capture financing should include preparing proposals for developing enabling policy elements \nsuch as optimal urban land use planning and regulations, and municipal resource mobilization among others. The \nrelevant agencies with mandate of urban planning and development, such as RAJUK will be consulted on these \nactivities as needed through the implementation framework to be established under (i).  \n24 The estimated cost of the program is $25,000. The JFPR will support $16,667 out of this estimated budget while the \nTASF-7 will support the remaining $8,333. \n \n ", "6 \nguidelines and the consultation process for obtaining such endorsement.25 \n(vi)  Arrange and coordinate knowledge-sharing workshops on the TA outputs. \n(vii)  Plan and implement focused dissemination efforts on the TA outputs. \n \nC.
