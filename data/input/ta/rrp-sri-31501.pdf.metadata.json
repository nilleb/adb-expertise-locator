An initial environmental examination was undertaken, \n  Assessment  the summary is a core appendix.  \n \nProject Description  The Project aims to contribute to poverty reduction efforts by \nincreasing the access to safe water and sanitation of the poor, \nthereby  improving  their  living conditions, especially of women. \nWithin this framework, the following challenges are addressed in \nthe  Project:  (i)  to  contribute  to  the  reconstruction  efforts  by \nproviding piped water to major urban centers in the northeast; (ii) \nto support the devolution of rural water supply and sanitation to \nthe  provincial  councils  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas;  and  (iii)  to \ncontinue  supporting  the  sector  reforms  identified  in  previous \ninterventions,  including  achievement  of  full  cost  recovery, \nindependent  regulation  of  the  water  sector,  and  increased \nparticipation of the private sector. The Project will provide water in \ntwo  major  urban  areas  in  the  North  Central,  and  Eastern \nprovinces, one urban area in the North Central Province, and two \nurban  areas  in  the  Southern  Province.  The  Project  will  also \nimplement  a  rural  water  supply  program  in  the  North  Central \nProvince  through  community-based  organizations,  local \ngovernment, and nongovernment organizations, and support the \nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) to advance \nand  adapt  to  the  ongoing  sector  reforms  by  improving  its \noperational efficiency and its financial management.  \n   \nRationale  In its Poverty Reduction Strategy, the Government states that \"the \nprovision  of  safe  drinking  water,  and  adequate  sewage  and \nsanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, highest social \nservice priority by poor households\u201d and it identifies access to \nsafe  water  and  appropriate  sanitation  as  one  of  its  priorities. \nSection III of the Government\u2019s 2001 Millenium Goals includes \nhalving by 2015 the proportion of people who are unable to reach \nor afford safe drinking water. It also identifies as a main strategy \nincreasing investment in the water and sanitation sectors. \n \n  Provision  for  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  Sri  Lanka  has \nimproved during the last 15 years. During this period, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been a constant partner in the \nsector. Yet, to achieve the Government's objective of increasing to \n85% the portion of the population with access to safe water in \n2010, about SLRs12 billion a year will be needed to meet the \ndemand for piped water supply by the year 2010. \n \n ", "i ii\n  In the last two years, the Government has reviewed its rural and \nurban water supply and sanitation policies to improve its capacity \nto face this challenge and it has proposed a \"two-pronged strategy \ninvolving large-scale system expansion for urban schemes and a \nvast number of small-scale community improvement initiatives, to \nbring  better  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  to  poor \ncommunities.\u201d  Consequently,  the  Project  will  focus  on  major \ninvestments in five secondary towns and in small community-\nbased rural water supply.  \n   \nObjectives   The overall goal of the Project is to contribute to poverty reduction \nefforts and to promote human development by improving access \nto  safe  water  and  sanitation  for  poor  populations,  thereby \ndecreasing  waterborne  diseases  and  reducing  the  amount  of \nresources spent in these activities. The Project objectives are to \n(i) provide safe water to 969,000 people and sanitation to 171,500 \nin five urban areas and in the rural districts of the North Central \nProvince; and (ii) increase the capacity of the Government of Sri \nLanka to provide safe water by strengthening the water sector \ninstitutions. \n \n  The Project components are: (i) provision of urban water supply, \nsanitation, and drainage in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, \nMuttur and Polonnaruwa; (ii) provision of rural water supply and \nsanitation in the districts of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa in the \nNorth Central Province; (iii) institutional strengthening focusing on \ntraining,  public  awareness  campaigns,  and  improvement  of \noperational and financial management of the NWSDB. \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $86.4 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange costs of $19.6 million (23%) and local currency \ncosts equivalent to $66.8 million (77%). \n   \nFinancing Plan    ($ million)   \n  Source  Foreign  Local  Total   \nExchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nADB    19.6    40.7    60.3    70.0 \nGovernment     0.0    23.0    23.0    26.6 \nCommunities    0.0    3.1    3.1    3.4 \nTotal    19.6    66.8    86.4    100.0 \n  Percentage Share    22.7    77.3    100.0   \n  ADB = Asian Development Bank \n \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n45,689,000 ($60.3 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources will be provided. The loan will have a 32 year term \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, with an interest rate of 1% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 September 2009 \n   \n ", " iv \n \nEstimated Project  31 March 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  A project management unit will be established in Colombo. To \nArrangements  head the unit, the Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure \nwill appoint a project director who will provide management and \npolicy support to the project implementation units and will facilitate \nthe detailed strategy and the implementation of the institutional \nstrengthening  component.  Project  implementation  units  will  be \nestablished in Batticaloa, Hambantota, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa \nto support the Project\u2019s urban investments. Two district project \nsupport units and 14 implementation units will support community-\nbased organizations in implementing the rural subprojects. The \nRural Water Supply  Division of NWSDB will provide technical \nsupport for the rural component. A participatory approach will be \nadopted to formulate and design the rural subprojects, and the \ncommunity  will  have  main  responsibility  for  subproject \nidentification, design, and implementation.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  NWSDB,  under  the  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Plantation \nInfrastructure \n \nProcurement  Goods  and  services  to  be  financed  by  the  ADB  loan  will  be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, \nreflecting  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  and  mandatory  use  of \nstandard  bidding  documents.  International  competitive  bidding \nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost \nthe equivalent of more than $500,000, and civil works contracts \nvalued at more than $2 million. Supply contracts with a value of \n$500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following \ninternational shopping and supply contracts at $100,000 and less \nmay  be  procured  following  local  competitive  bidding  or  direct \npurchase procedures. Civil works contracts valued at $2 million or \nless will be carried out under local competitive bidding. \n   \nConsulting Services  The  Project  will  require  1,140  person-months  of  consulting \nservices (120 person-months of international and 1,020 person-\nmonths  of  domestic)  for  design  engineering,  finance  and \naccounting,  social  development,  community  development,  and \nproject management. Two consulting firms will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by \nAsian Development Bank and its Borrowers using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method and other arrangements satisfactory \nto ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n ", "v \nProject Benefits and  The main benefits of the Projects will be: (i) improved health and \n  Beneficiaries  nutrition; (ii) less resources (time and cash) spent by households \nin water provision, especially by women and young girls; and (iii) \nsupport to environmentally sustainable economic and population \ngrowth, especially in the urban centers. By reducing child mortality \nand  malnutrition  due  to  waterborne  diseases,  and  increasing \nenvironmental sustainability due to a reduction of ground water \nextraction  and  unsafe  sanitation  practices,  the  Project  directly \naddresses ADB\u2019s goal of poverty reduction and contributes to the \nachievement of the Government\u2019s Millenium Goals.  \n \nAn indirect benefit of the Project will be its support to the ongoing \npeace process. The cooperation needed to implement the project \nsubcomponents in the northeast will provide a visible platform for \nthe  commitment  to  the  peace  process  and  will  translate  the \nbenefits of the peace process into specific improvements to the \nliving conditions of the civilian population, who have suffered from \ncivil unrest for the last two decades \n \nOther benefits include improving school attendance due to better \nhealth and reduced water carrying burdens, especially for girls; \nsupporting  sustainable  economic  growth  of  targeted  urban \ncenters; supporting decentralization efforts; and improving health \nfor the general population and reduced mortality. \n \n  The Project will provide access to safe water to about 969,000 \npeople in the cities of Batticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur and \nPolonnaruwa  and  in  the  rural  areas  of  Anuradhapura  and \nPolonnaruwa.  About  171,500  people  will  benefit  from  safe \nsanitation facilities. Upon completion of the Project, all residential, \ncommercial,  industrial,  and  institutional  consumers  in  project \nurban areas will receive 24 hour water supply. In the rural areas, \n85% of the population will have access to safe drinking water by \nproject  completion.  Tariffs  and  connection  fees  have  been \ncalculated to be affordable by potential consumers; thus, assuring \nan optimum rate of connection and targeting of the poor. \n \nAt a macro level, 74% of the capital investment of the Project will \nbenefit the poor rural population in the north central province and \nurban population in the northeast region. Poverty in the north \ncentral region is at least 8% higher than the national average and \nthe  incidence  of  poverty  is  even  higher  for  targeted  rural \nbeneficiaries. Due to civil conflict, no official statistics exist for the \nurban population of the northeast project towns, but are likely far \ngreater than in the other areas of the district. \n   \n ", " vi \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The Project assumes (i) a stable political environment and positive \neconomic growth in Sri Lanka; (ii) continuing Government support \nto the Project, in the form of timely procurement and availability of \nfunds,  and  support  to  the  decentralization  process;  and  (iii) \nindependent  regulation  of  the  water  sector  and  the  improved \nefficiency of water service provision. Especially, it is assumed that \ntariff setting will be driven by financial considerations and that it \nwill be independent of political influence, to achieve adequate \nlevels of project cost recovery and proper asset management. \n \nIt is assumed that rural communities will demand the improvement \nof water infrastructure in their communities and will be willing to \ncontribute up to 20% of the capital investment and to take over the \noperation and maintenance of the schemes. \n \nDisruption of the peace process may delay project implementation \nin Batticaloa and Muttur.  Weak political support for sector reforms \nwould impede the implementation of the strategies to improve the \noperational and financial efficiency of NWSDB and other service \nproviders. \n \n   ", " \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Democratic  Socialist  Republic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Secondary  Towns  and  Rural \nCommunity-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \n2.  In its Poverty Reduction Strategy the Government states that \"the provision of safe \ndrinking water, and adequate sewage and sanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, \nhighest social service priority by poor households\u201d1 and it identifies access to safe water and \nappropriate sanitation as one of its priorities. Section III of the 2001 Millenium Goals includes \nhalving, by 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or afford safe drinking water. \nIt also identifies, as one of the main strategies increased investment in the water and sanitation \nsectors.2  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  country  strategy  for  the  social  sectors \nemphasizes the development of adequate infrastructure and services in urban areas outside \nColombo. 3 \n \n3.  Provision for water supply and sanitation in Sri Lanka has improved during the last 15 \nyears.  During  this  period,  ADB has been a constant partner in the sector. However, the \nrequirements  for  potable  drinking  water  and  sanitation  have  exceeded  the  Government's \ninstitutional and financial capacity. At present, piped water service is only available to 29% of \nthe population, mostly in urban areas. In rural areas, supply coverage is only 57%. The \nGovernment estimates that the investment requirements in the water sector will be as much as \n$1.125 million during the 2001\u20132010 period.  \n \n4.  Finally,  with  the progress of the peace process, Sri Lanka faces the challenge of \nreconstruction efforts, including improving the access to water and sanitation in areas of the \ncountry where no investment in basic infrastructure has taken place in the last 20 years. The \nProject will contribute to these efforts by providing piped water to major urban centers in the \nnortheast. \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n5.  In April 2002, the Government of Sri Lanka approved a tariff increase that allows the \nNational Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) to finance operation and maintenance \n(O&M) and debt service from tariffs.4 And during the last 5 years, a number of activities such as \nmeter reading and billing and collection have been out-sourced to the private sector. To reduce \npersonnel ratios, no new staff have been hired. NWSDB is now in a better position to take over \nthe O&M and rehabilitation of existing urban schemes, and it has gained significant experience \nwith implementing participatory approaches in rural communities (which has proved to be more \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2002.

Road Map Towards the Implementation of the United Nations Millenium Declaration. Report \nof the Secretary-General. \n3\n  In 2000, the Government of Sri Lanka requested ADB assistance to prepare a water supply and sanitation project. \nIn December 2000, a $1 million technical assistance (TA3587-SRI: Secondary Towns Water Supply Sanitation \nProject) was approved and the consultants (Coffey MPW et. al.), mobilized on 15 May 2001. \n4\n  In doing so, the Government has complied with Loan Covenants 13.a and 13c of L1575-SRI: ADB. 1997. Third \nWater Supply and Sanitation (Sector). Manila. A detailed review of these covenants is included as Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n ", " 2 \n \nsustainable than top-down approaches). \n \n6.  However, more progress is needed. To improve the sector\u2019s performance, the following \nreforms should be implemented: (i) improving the operational efficiency and self-financing ratios \nof water schemes, (ii) decentralizing to local governments and community-based organizations \n(CBOs) the responsibility for small schemes, (iii) increasing the participation of the private \nsector, and (iv) creating an independent regulatory structure. The project framework is shown in \nAppendix 1, and a detailed discussion of the policy environment and ongoing sector reforms is \nincluded in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n7.  Where no piped systems exist, most people rely on groundwater for drinking purposes. \nAlthough groundwater quality in most parts of the country is good and relatively constant \nthroughout the year, biological contamination, high levels of fluoride, and salinity intrusion in \nwells and water intakes is a common problem in the project areas. In addition, urban growth has \nincreased pressure on the already scarce groundwater resources, making the need for piped \nwater supply more urgent. NWSDB is mainly responsible for water supply in Sri Lanka and \nmanages 181 piped water schemes. Budgetary support for construction of new piped schemes \nis limited and NWSDB does not have the capacity to finance new investments through tariffs. As \na result, the sector depends on external funding to increase coverage (Appendix 3 describes the \nexisting external assistance in the sector). \n \n8.  The main problems faced by the sector in the delivery of water and sanitation are its low \nself-financing ratios, poor asset management, and high production costs. The underlying causes \nof these problems are the lack of appropriate management incentives, an inefficient cross-\nsubsidy structure, and an over centralized delivery of services.5 Consequently, the sector faces \npoor service levels and coverage. To address these problems, the new Government policy6 for \nthe sector recognizes that (i) water is a basic need, but also has an economic value and that \nwithin the acknowledged limits of affordability the Government will seek full cost recovery in its \ntariff policy and phase out heavy cross-subsidies among users; (ii) eventually the mandate for \nschemes under 1,000 connections will be fully shifted to local authorities; and (iii) conditions in \nthe sector must be conducive to attract private sector investment. These issues are currently \nbeing addressed by sector reforms and have been integrated in the proposed Project. \n \n9.  Lessons learned from previous water projects in Sri Lanka indicate the need to improve \nthe financial sustainability of NWSDB, to enhance the involvement of beneficiaries in planning \nand implementation, to improve water demand management, and to improve the efficiency of \nservice delivery.7 The reviews of ADB's projects stressed the need for increasing community \ninvolvement, setting up professional project management  units (PMUs), and decentralizing \noperations.8 The Government has also reviewed external assistance to the sector and has \nrecommended  a  \"two-pronged\u201d  strategy  involving  large-scale  system  expansion  (for  urban \nschemes) and a vast number of small-scale community improvement initiatives, to bring better \nwater supply and sanitation services to poor communities.  \n                                                 \n5  The challenges faced by the rural and urban sectors differ and are analyzed in more detailed in Appendix 2. \n6  Government of Sri Lanka. 2002.

In line with the Government and ADB policies and the lessons learned, the Project will \nfinance investments in five large-scale urban water schemes and in small community-based \nprojects in rural areas. The Project will address the key problems in the sector by including in \nthe  Project  design  (i)  local  government  and  community  participation  in  the  planning  and \nimplementation of rural projects, with communities contributing up to 20% of the capital cost and \nbecoming owners of the assets; (ii) delegation of O&M for rural schemes to CBOs and a \nstrategy to improve operational efficiency of NWSDB; (iii) implementation of a strategy to \nimprove the financial sustainability of NWSDB; and (iv) public awareness campaigns to educate \nconsumers about water as a scarce resource and the relationship between water, sanitation, \nand health; and the new institutions in the sector. In addition, ADB has proposed advisory \ntechnical assistance to support the development of water sector regulation under the Public \nUtilities Commission. Appendix 4 describes in detail how the Project design has incorporated \nthese lessons. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n11.  In  March  2002,  the  Government  and  ADB  signed  a  poverty  reduction  partnership \nagreement,  which  highlighted  the  access  to  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  as  a  key \ndimension in reducing poverty for Sri Lanka. The goal of the Project is to reduce the incidence \nof waterborne diseases in the beneficiary populations and to reduce the level of resources (both \ncash and time) that targeted households spend in acquiring water for their basic needs. The \nProject will also increase the capacity of water sector institutions to operate, maintain, and \naugment existing water schemes and to invest in new water schemes in rural and urban areas. \n \n12.  The objective of the Project is to deliver safe water to approximately 969,000 people and \nprovide sanitation to 171,500 people. The Project will benefit people living in the rural areas of \nAnuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts in the North Central Province and in the towns of \nBatticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur, and Polonnaruwa. The Project will also increase the \nfinancial and institutional sustainability of NWSDB and the institutional capacity of the provincial \ncouncils, Pradeshiya Sabhas, and CBOs participating in the Project. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n13.  The project components are (i) provision of urban water supply and sanitation in five \nurban centers (the urban component); (ii) provision of rural water supply and sanitation in two \ndistricts of the North Central Province (the rural component); and (iii) institutional strengthening \nand public awareness campaigns (the institutional strengthening component).  \n \n  1.  Urban Component \n \n14.  The urban component (Table 1) will (i) provide new piped water supply systems and \nimprovement of drainage in the towns of Batticaloa and Muttur, (ii) expand the existing water \nsupply systems in the towns of Polonnaruwa and Hambantota, (iii) provide for construction of a \nsalinity barrier at the intake in Matara to prevent saline intrusion during dry periods, (iv) provide \nwastewater collection and treatment for Batticaloa Hospital, and (v) improve drainage in the \nmost densely populated areas of Batticaloa and Muttur. Local authorities will be engaged by the \nPMU in the implementation of the drainage subcomponent. The administrative divisions, where \ndrainage will be undertaken, will be selected based on population density and state of existing \nfacilities.  \n ", " 4 \n \nTable 1: Urban Subcomponents \nTown  Subcomponent \nBatticaloa  a.

Rural Component \n \n15.  The rural component will finance a demand-driven and community-based rural program \nto  provide  water  and  sanitation  in  14  selected  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  of  Polonnaruwa  and \nAnuradhapura districts in North Central Province. An estimated 322,000 people will be provided \nwith  safe  water  and  138,000  with  latrines.  Subprojects  will  be  identified  during  project \nimplementation based on criteria approved by ADB. Subproject selection combines elements of \nboth a poverty-targeted and a demand-responsive approach. Poor and underserved areas will \nbe  identified  in  each  local  government  based  on  transparent  criteria.  The  administrative \ndivisions that exhibit the highest incidence of poverty and lack of water supply, and that are \ninterested and willing to contribute 20% of the investment costs and take responsibility for the \nO&M of the facilities, will be invited to apply for assistance. After counterpart nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) and local government technical officers have provided initial training and \ninformation regarding source availability, initial capital investment, and expected O&M cost for \neach option, the beneficiaries themselves will choose the type of system they want to implement \nin their community. Technologies selected should be simple and appropriate, have affordable \ncapital cost, and be within the community\u2019s capability for O&M management. Technologies \nrecognized as appropriate for rural water supply are tubewells with hand pumps, shallow dug \nwells,  pipe-borne  water  supply  schemes  (gravity  or  pumping),  rainwater  harvesting,  and \nhousehold  water  treatment  technologies.  CBOs  will  contribute  a  minimum  of  20%  of  the \nconstruction cost, or the entire unskilled labor component, whichever is higher. Further, the \nproject contribution per household is limited to a ceiling that will be calculated depending on the \nwater supply technology.  \n \n16.  The rural component focuses on the project beneficiaries developing the ownership of \nthe Project. The beneficiaries will organize into CBOs and participate actively in the project \ndesign and implementation. The component includes institutional support for the North Central \nProvincial Council and for participating Pradeshiya Sabhas and CBOs to develop their capacity ", "5 \nto implement, operate, and maintain water supply schemes and sanitation facilities and assure \nthe sustainability of water supply after project completion.  \n \n3.  Institutional Strengthening \n \n17.  The institutional strengthening component will support specific strategies to improve \nNWSDB\u2019s  financial  management  and  service  delivery.  This  component  has  three \nsubcomponents. \n \na.  National Public Awareness and Education Campaign \n \n18.  The Project will support NWSDB in developing and implementing a national strategy \nfocusing  on  educating  and  raising  awareness  on  the  need  to  improve  water  demand \nmanagement and conservation, and improving public knowledge of the new National Water \nSupply and Sanitation Policy. Special attention will be given to ongoing changes in the sector, \nincluding the existence of new service providers, private sector participation, the need for tariffs \nto reflect real cost, and the role of the public utilities commission in monitoring service standards \nand protecting consumers rights. The Project will also support project implementation units \n(PIUs) under the urban component and Pradeshiya Sabha implementation units (PSIUs) under \nthe rural component to run project-specific awareness campaigns on hygiene and sanitation. \n \nb.  NWSDB Financial and Operational Improvement Support  \n \n19.  The Project will help NWSDB improve its management, especially financial management \nand regional operations within the context of the recent sector reforms and policies, including \nthe establishment of a public utilities commission, the participation of private operators in the \nsector, and the decentralization of the provision of water to local authorities.  \n \n20.  NWSDB will prepare a strategy to improve its financial management and operations, \nwith a detailed schedule and financial plan, to be submitted to ADB for approval within 3 months \nof loan effectiveness. The strategy will include detailed designs for the implementation of the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  NWSDB will implement a corporate strategy to improve (among others) financial \nplanning and resource allocation to adapt to the current reforms in the sector, \nwith emphasis in reduction of tariff cross-subsidies, introduction of performance-\nbased financial incentives to regional centers, and appropriate management of \nexisting  assets.  The  strategy  is  to  be  implemented  within  2  years  of  loan \neffectiveness. \n(ii)  NWSDB will implement its strategy and action plan to address audit findings and \nKPMG  International9 accounting and financial management recommendations \nagreed on 13 September 2002. These are to be implemented within 1 year of \nloan effectiveness. \n(iii)  NWSDB will implement, within 2 years of loan effectiveness, an action plan to \nimprove operational performance including cubic meters billed, collection rates, \naging of accounts receivable, staff to connection ratio, kilowatt-hours of electricity \nused, and reduction of establishment expenses.  \n(iv)  NWSDB  will  complete  an  asset  registry  in  all  regional  (outside  of  Greater \n                                                 \n9   ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance for the Accounting  Review of the National Water Supply and Drainage Board. \nManila. \n ", " 6 \n \nColombo) water supply schemes with more than 10,000 connections, within 2 \nyears of loan effectiveness. \n(v)  The strategy will identify water schemes with less than 1,000 connections for \nrehabilitation and eventual transfer to local government institutions, the private \nsector, and/or CBOs within 4 years of loan effectiveness. The strategy will focus \non improving the efficiency of the schemes so they can be profitable and on \ntraining of the Pradeshiya Sabhas, private sector entities, and/or CBOs for taking \nover the schemes. The NWSDB will agree with a local authority, the private \nsector, or CBOs to take responsibility for the assets and O&M, prior to disbursing \nproject  funds  for  scheme-specific  investments  (physical  works  and  O&M \ntraining).  The  implementation  will  be  completed  within  4  years  of  loan \neffectiveness. Any physical works implemented under this subproject will follow \nGovernment  and  ADB  guidelines,  including  guidelines  on  environment,  land \nacquisition, and resettlement. \n \n21.  The performance of NWSDB will be measured in relation to the specific components. \nTarget indicators have been defined in Appendix 2, Table A2.2, and the Government, NWSDB, \nand ADB will monitor performance of this component according to these targets. \n \nc.  Training \n \n22.  Water supply system operators in the district offices and NWSDB, technical officers in \nthe Pradeshiya Sabhas, and CBOs will be trained during project implementation. Under the \nurban component, contractors\u2019 obligations will include training of NWSDB staff in the O&M of \nthe new facilities. The training will be carried out in conjunction with the physical implementation \nof the Project. The rural component will provide training to strengthen CBOs\u2019 capacity to \nparticipate in community development. This training will be undertaken by NGOs. In addition, \nthe institutional strengthening component will provide resources for management training of \nNWSDB staff. NWSDB will submit for ADB's concurrence a 5-year strategic training plan within \n3 months of fielding of the two project management consultants and an annual training plan \nprior to 31 October of each year. The plan will specify training institutions, methodologies, \ntargeted population, and expected outputs. As per the gender action plan, 20% of the trainees \nwill be women. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n23.  Support for the Peace Process. Major physical works for Batticaloa and Muttur water \nsupply  systems  will  take  place  in  conflict  affected  areas.  During  project  preparation,  the \nGovernment of Sri Lanka and the local community representatives were consulted to obtain \ntheir consensus and support for the project. Both the Government and the local community \nbelieve that construction of badly needed water supply and sanitation in these areas can \npromote the peace process.  \n \n24.  Ethnic Diversity. Ethnicity has been integrated in project design, with all major ethnic \ngroups  in  Sri  Lanka  significantly  represented  among  the  beneficiary  population.  Within \nsubcomponents, attention was made to include all ethnic groups within the project area so \nbenefits will accrue equally to all groups residing in the project towns.  \n \n25.  Targeting the Poor. Mechanisms to ensure that the project benefits will accrue to the \npoorest of the poor include the following: (i) populations that cannot afford a connection will \nhave access to safe water through metered public stand posts to be provided by the Project; (ii) ", "7 \ncontinuation of the financial mechanisms provided by NWSDB to subsidized connection fees \nand  facilitate  initial  payment  to  recipients  of  the  government\u2019s  social  assistance  program \n(Samurdhi);  and  (iii)  tariff  structure  is  designed  to  provide  affordable  prices  for  basic \nconsumption10 while full cost recovery prices apply only to consumption above 100 liters per \nperson per day. See Appendix 5, Poverty Reduction and Social Development Strategy, for a \ndetailed discussion of the Project's social impacts. \n \n26.  Demand-Driven and Participatory Approach through NGOs. The rural component is \nbased in a demand-driven participatory approach facilitated by NGOs where the beneficiaries \norganize in CBOs and collectively take responsibility for the subprojects implementation and the \nO&M of water systems. The counterpart NGOs work with the communities to raise awareness \nand introduce the project methodology. Communities are required to show their commitment by \nproviding self-assessment forms and contributing to 20% of the capital cost of the Project. The \nbeneficiaries decide on the type of technology for the schemes and, with the assistance of the \nproject staff, they take responsibility for designing and implementing the schemes. The Project \nprovides  training  and  practical  experience  to  the  beneficiaries  in  project  and  financial \nmanagement,  which  will  provide  communities  with  the  skills  to  initiate  other  community \nimprovements. \n \n27.  Support to Decentralization. The Project supports decentralization of the provision of \nservices to local governments, private providers, and civil society. The rural component will be \nimplemented by CBOs, and facilitated by NGOs and Pradeshiya Sabhas. The latest will be the \nPIUs for the rural component and Pradeshiya Sabhas will receive training and assistance to \ndevelop their technical knowledge of rural water schemes, to improve their project management \nand monitoring skills and to enhance their capacity to work with NGOs and CBOs using \nparticipatory demand-driven approaches. The institutional component will assist NWSDB to \ntransfer the management of small schemes to local governments, CBOs, or the private sector \nand requires the out-sourcing to the private sector of noncore activities for all new schemes.  \n \n28.  Policy. The Project supports ongoing policy reforms and provides the resources for \nNWSDB to adapt to its new role in the sector. The implementation of the corporate management \nstrategy, the financial strategy, and the operational strategy under the institutional component \nwill allow NWSDB to continue to provide services in the sector under the new policy framework, \nwhich includes the participation of the private sector, introduction of independent regulation \nunder the public utilities commission, and decentralization to local governments. \n \n29.  Resettlement. The Project will require the permanent acquisition of 10.0 hectares (ha) \nof land, of which 1.1 ha are owned by NWSDB, 7.5 ha are owned by the Government, and 1.4 \nha are privately owned. Acquisition of the identified land will not result in loss of livelihoods or \ncommunity resources and it will affect seven people. A short resettlement plan has been \ndiscussed  with  the  affected  people  and  is  a  public  document  in  ADB\u2019s  web  page.    The \nconstruction of the Batticaloa scheme requires raising the Unnichchai tank bund to increase raw \nwater availability for domestic consumption.  During construction works, it may be necessary to \nlower the tank water level to below dead water level.  This may deprive a source of livelihood for \none dry season to 1,898 farmers and 2,200 wage laborers that depend on the Unnichchai tank \nfor irrigation.  It may also deprive 177 fishermen of income because they will not be able to fish \nfor 1 year. If construction activities affect irrigation, a plan has been developed to provide fair \ncompensation to any person that temporarily may lose all or part of its income due to the \nproject, as defined under Sri Lanka\u2019s National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB's Policy \n                                                 \n10  Government of Sri Lanka Water Policy defines basic consumption as 100 liters per capita per day. \n ", " 8 \n \non Involuntary Resettlement. Appendix 6 contains a summary of the short resettlement plans for \nland acquisition and temporary loss of income.   \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n30.  The total cost of the Project, including physical and price contingencies, and taxes and \nduties, is estimated at $86.3 million equivalent. The cost estimates are summarized in Table 2. \nDetailed cost estimates are found in Appendix 7. \n \nTable 2: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n31.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $60.3 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources. ADB will finance approximately 70% of the project costs. ADB financing will be used \nto finance costs relating to civil works, procurement of vehicles, office equipment, consulting \nservices, and training and public awareness and education campaigns, but will exclude salaries \nof project counterpart staff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties. The Government and \ncommunity will provide $22.5 million and $3.6 million equivalent, respectively (26% and 4% of \ntotal costs). The financing of the local currency cost by ADB is justified on the basis of social \nbenefits accruing from the Project and its positive environmental impact. The summary of the \nfinancing plan is in Table 3. \n ", "9 \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total Cost  Percent \nSource  Exchange  Currency  (%) \n         \nAsian Development Bank   19.6  40.7  60.3  70 \nGovernment of Sri Lanka  0  23.0  23.0  27 \nCommunity  0  3.1  3.1  3 \nTotal  19.6  66.8  86.4  100 \n       \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n \n32.  The loan will have a 32 year term, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest \ncharge  of  1%  per  annum  during  the  grace  period  and  1.5%  per  annum thereafter. The \ncommunity contribution corresponds to the rural component, and is equal to 20% of the capital \ncost up to a defined limit for each technical option.  \n \n33.  The  financial  assessment  was  undertaken  to  assess  the  viability  of  the  Project, \nunderstood as the capacity of each subcomponent to generate sufficient revenues to cover \ncapital and operating costs and generate rates of return that meet or exceed the weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC). Revenues are those derived from water tariffs and other \nrelated charges directly attributable to the Project. The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for \neach project town ranges between 5.2% and 9.9% and the FIRR for the project overall is 7.5%. \nAll exceed the WACC estimated at 0.78% for the four towns. The sensitivity of the FIRR was \ntested for increases in capital cost, increases in O&M cost, and reduction in overall revenues. \nThe FIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in incremental revenues derived from water tariffs; \nhowever, the FIRR is  sufficiently  robust  and  exceeds  the  WACC  following  the  sensitivity \nanalysis. See Appendix 8 for a detailed discussion of the financial analysis. \n \n34.  The Government will make the proceeds of the proposed loan available to NWSDB \nthrough  a  subsidiary  financing  agreement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  financial  analysis  has \nassumed current lending agreements between the Government of Sri Lanka and NWSDB, \nwhich are expected to be maintained. Of funding for water supply schemes in Pradeshiya \nSabhas, 85% will be made available to NWSDB as a grant and 15% as a loan; for urban local \nauthorities, 50% as a grant and 50% as a loan; and for rural communities, 100% as a grant. In \neach case, financing will be at the rate of 10% per annum and the repayment period will be 24 \nyears with a grace period of 8 years. \n \n35.  The Project is economically viable. The estimated economic internal rate of return for the \nurban component varies from 12.7% to 17.2% and the projected economic internal rate of return \nfor the rural component is 13%. Benefits were calculated taking into account the savings in time \nand cash currently used to access safe water and sanitation. Unquantifiable benefits such as \nhealth have not been included in the analysis but will accrue in the form of gains in productive \ndays for the economically active population and lower medical expenses for beneficiaries and \nfor Government's public health institutions. The sensitivity of the results was tested for different \ntimes spent collecting water, rates of growth in real household incomes, and levels of O&M cost; \nlower cross-subsidies from nondomestic water consumption; and higher construction works and \nassumed consumption. A detailed economic analysis is in Appendix 9. \n \n ", " 10 \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n36.  NWSDB, under the Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure (MH&PI), will be the \nexecuting agency. A PMU will be established in Colombo under NWSDB, to support the Project. \nPIUs will be established in each of the project towns under the urban component, and PSIUs \nand technical support units will be established under the rural component. A provincial project \ncoordinating committee will be established in the North Central Provincial Council to provide \ncoordination for the rural PSIUs. A national steering committee (NSC) chaired by the secretary, \nMH&PI, who will be the project coordinator will guide the PMU and make all policy and strategic \ndecisions. Complementary project coordinating committees will be established at the district, \ndivisional, and village levels. The Government will  call for a coordination meeting of funding \norganizations to the water sector at least once a year to assure coordination of sector reforms \nand  interventions  supported  by  external  funds  and  to  assure  exchange  of  information. \nImplementation responsibilities of each institution and a flow chart of the structure are included \nin Appendix 10. \n \n37.  The PMU will be established in the NWSDB\u2019s Colombo office. An experienced project \ndirector will be appointed to head the PMU. A core team of NWSDB employees will assist the \nproject director. They will be supported by a project management consulting team headed by a \nteam  leader  (international)  and  deputy  team  leader  (domestic).  A  separate  design  and \nsupervision team of consultants will assist in detailed design and construction supervision of the \nurban water supply components. PIUs will be established under the district officers of the \nNWSDB  for  each  of  the  four  urban  water  supply  subcomponents.  A  separate  irrigation \ndepartment PIU will be established under the Irrigation Department to implement the Unnichchai \ntank bund raising subcomponent. Under the rural component, PSIUs will be established in the \nparticipating Pradeshiya Sabhas, which will each employ full time one technical officer for the \nduration of the Project. The technical support units at Polonnaruwa and Anuradhapura will be \nsupported by a team of consultants specializing in rural water supply, community participation, \nand institutional capacity building. The Rural Water Supply section of NWSDB will act as the \ntechnical advisory unit for the rural component and will provide technical support to the technical \nsupport units and PSIUs. The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Division in MH&PI will provide \npolicy guidance to PMU, provincial project coordinating committee, project support units, and \nPSIUs, and will monitor policy implementation.  \n \n38.  The  NSC,  chaired  by  the  secretary,  MH&PI  will  provide  overall  coordination  and \nguidance for the Project.11 During the project implementation, the NSC will be responsible for (i) \ndealing  with  policy  matters  as  they  arise,  and  (ii)  coordinating  with  other  ministries  and \nagencies. The NSC will meet at least every 3 months, or as often as necessary. In addition, a \nprovincial coordinating committee will be established in North Central Province for monitoring \nand coordination purposes immediately after the effective date. \n \n39.  The participating Pradeshiya Sabhas, CBOs, and NGOs will (i) implement instructions in \nthe manuals developed under the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project12 when they \n                                                 \n11  The National Steering Committee will be chaired by the secretary, MH&PI and will include representatives from \nNWSDB, Ministry of Policy Development and Planning, Ministry of Irrigation, Ministry of Health, Ministry of \nProvincial Councils and Local Government, Chief Secretary of North Central Province, line agencies under these \nministries, and others. \n12  The Water Supply Management Manual for Pradeshiya Sabhas  and the Water Supply Management Manual for \nCBOs. ", "11 \nhave been approved by the Rural Water Supply Division of the MH&PI, and (ii) institute and \ncomply with the by-laws and resolutions for the management of rural water supply developed \nunder the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Project when they have been approved by the \nprovincial councils and other concerned local authorities. The Project will ensure that CBOs and \nPradeshiya Sabhas enter into agreements relating to management, regulation, and distribution \nof water. \n \n40.  The PMU will undertake central procurement for the urban and institutional components, \nincluding for the capacity building component and the packages for materials and equipment. \nCounterpart funds will be channeled to the PlUs through regular budgetary allocations, including \nappropriate  allocations  for  taxes  and  duties.  For  the  rural  component,  the  funds  will  be \nchanneled from the PMU to the project support unit in Anuradhapura, to the PSIUs, and then to \nthe  CBOs  and  NGOs  involved  in  the  implementation.13  CBOs  will  be  responsible  for  the \nprocuring supplies for their own subprojects. Costs will be recovered from the consumers in the \nform of tariff charges, connection fees, and capital cost contributions.  \n \n41.  At the start of the Project, the PMU will help the PIUs and the PSIUs formulate budgets \nfor all activities, with estimates for each year of project implementation. These budgets will be \nreviewed and updated every 6 months and approved  by the PMU before implementation. \nExpenditures will be recorded at source by the implementing agencies, PlUs, PSIUs, district \nPMUs, and PMU. The PMU will approve and supervise all drawdown arrangements. The PMU \nwill be responsible for compiling project expenditures based on its own expenditures and the \nreports of expenditures submitted by the PlUs, PSIUs, and project support units. It will report \nproject expenditures to NWSDB, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis, with quarterly and \nannual summaries.  \n \n2.  Implementation Schedule \n \n42.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years starting in March 2003 and ending in \nMarch  2009.  Detailed  feasibility  and  engineering  design  will  commence  1  year  after  loan \neffectiveness and tendering of contracts will commence 21 months after loan effectiveness. \nConstruction  of  the  urban  water  supply  and  distribution  facilities  included  in  the  urban \ncomponent will begin 2 years and 9 months after loan effectiveness and be completed within 2.5 \nyears. All components will be implemented in the five urban cities simultaneously. In the rural \ncomponent,  review  of  guidelines,  public  awareness,  and  community  mobilization  work  will \nprecede the physical implementation of the subprojects. The project implementation schedule is \nincluded in Appendix 10. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n43.  Goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement and the Government\u2019s procurement procedures acceptable to ADB. \nUrban  water  supply  schemes  will  be  combined  into  design,  supervision,  and  supply  and \nconstruction packages for international competitive bidding and local competitive bidding (LCB). \nDue  to  preceding  ADB  projects  in  the  water  sector  in  Sri  Lanka,  the  capacity  of  local \ncontractors, and the expected limited interest of international contractors to work in difficulty \nareas, civil works contracts valued over $2 million equivalent and equipment contracts valued \nover  $500,000  equivalent  will  be  undertaken  through  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures. Civil works contracts valued at $2 million equivalent or less will be carried out under \n                                                 \n13  The PIUs must have qualified for imprest accounts under the disbursement arrangements. \n ", " 12 \n \nLCB  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  in  accordance  with  Government  regulations. \nEquipment  packages  valued  at  $500,000  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following \ninternational shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Supply contracts (for goods) valued at \n$100,000  and  less  could  be  procured  following  LCB  or  direct  purchase  procedures.  All \nconstruction works for the rural component are expected to be valued  at less than $1 million \nequivalent and therefore to be procured through LCB, or, in the case of contracts valued at less \nthan SLRs2 million (approximately $20,000) equivalent, by the CBOs through procedures for \ncommunity  participation  in  procurement  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  proposed  procurement \npackages are in Appendix 11. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n44.  A total of 1,140 person-months of consulting services are estimated, of which 120 are \ninternational and 1,020 are local. For project management, 711 person-months of consulting \nservices will be required to support the PMUs, PIUs, PSIUs, project support units, and provincial \nproject  coordinating  committees.  Consulting  services  for  detailed  design  and  construction \nsupervision for the urban component, including the Unnichchai Tank, will be contracted out \nseparately and 536 person-months are estimated to be required. International consultants will \nbe involved in both project management and in detailed design and construction supervision \nactivities. The international consultants in the PMU will provide advice on the best international \npractices  to  NWSDB  for  designing  strategies  to  implement  the  institutional  strengthening \ncomponent. For the rural component, the Pradeshiya Sabhas will contract with suitable NGOs to \nbe partner organizations and work with the CBOs. Summary terms of reference for all consulting \nservices are provided in Appendix 12. Consultant firms financed under the loan will be recruited \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank \nand its Borrowers using the quality- and cost-based selection method and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n45.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for the counterpart funds, collecting supporting documents, and preparing \nwithdrawal applications and sending them to ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook. To facilitate the timely release of loan proceeds and counterpart funds and to \nexpedite project implementation, the Government will, immediately after loan effectiveness, \nopen and maintain a project imprest account with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for NWSDB, to \nbe managed by the PMU. The total advances to the imprest account, including the initial \nadvance, will not at any time exceed estimated ADB-financed expenditures for the next 6 \nmonths or 10% of the loan amount, whichever is lower. The ceiling of the imprest account will \nbe  $2  million.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  Project  and,  with  respect  to  the  rural \ncomponent, in keeping with the Government\u2019s Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Policy of \ndecentralization, second generation imprest accounts will be established at the Central Bank of \nSri Lanka for the technical support units and for the district office of NWSDB at Anuradhapura. \nSubject to the approval of ADB based on the development of adequate financial and accounting \ncontrols in the Pradeshiya Sabhas, third generation imprest accounts to receive funds from the \nrural component second-generation imprest accounts may be established at any bank approved \nby the Central Bank of Sri Lanka for each PSIU. The initial ceiling of the second and third \nimprest accounts will be $200,000 equivalent and $20,000 equivalent, respectively. Because the \nPradeshiya  Sabhas  have  only  limited  experience  with  implementing  externally  financed \ninvestment projects, the third generation imprest accounts will be established in PSIUs only \nafter the fielding of the project-financed financial management consultants. The PMU will be ", "13 \nresponsible for ensuring that all imprest accounts will be established, managed, replenished, \nand liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Loan Disbursement Handbook, and with detailed \narrangements  agreed  to  by  the  Government  and  ADB.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures \nprocedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest accounts.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n46.  The  Government  will  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation  following  the  ADB  standard  procedures.  The  PMU  will  be  responsible  for \nobtaining and consolidating relevant data from PIUs and PSIUs. The PlUs and PSIUs will \nmaintain separate project accounts, in coordination with the PMU, which will prepare the project \naccounts and related financial statements, including imprest account statements for all imprest \naccounts and records of the statement of expenditures. NWSDB and the Pradeshiya Sabhas \nwill maintain an adequate accounting system. Any PIU or PSIU for which an imprest account is \nestablished will agree to have its project accounts audited by NWSDB. The accounts and \nstatements of expenditure and revenues related to the Project will be audited annually by \nauditors acceptable to ADB. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and \nstatement of expenditure procedure. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account \nand statement of expenditure procedure will be included in the annual audit report. Audited \nproject subaccounts and financial statements, together with the report of the auditor, will be \nsubmitted to ADB through the PMU within 9 months after the end of each fiscal/financial year. In \naddition, the audited annual report of NWSDB will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 months \nafter the close of each fiscal year following the reporting period. The PMU will also submit to \nADB, within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project, a project completion report \nfollowing standard ADB procedures. The PMU and project support units will have an adequate \nnumber of suitably qualified accounting staff, including a senior officer. \n \n7.  Advance Action  \n \n47.  ADB management has approved advance action for procurement of consulting services \nand civil works. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action does not \ncommit ADB to finance the whole or any part of the Project and that consultants will be \ncontracted and fielded only upon effectiveness of the loan. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n48.  Annual Operation Plans and Financial Review. To facilitate project implementation \nand decentralization of communal services, both the Government and the local governments will \nprepare by 31 December of each year an operation plan for the next fiscal year. The plan will \ninclude  (i)  proposed  budgetary  allocations  for  communal  services,  and,  specifically,  the \nallocation of sufficient counterpart funds from local and central governments and other sources \nfor timely project implementation; (ii) status of policy actions; and (iii) financing plan for the \nproject activities for the succeeding year. The plan will confirm that the Government has \nallocated an adequate budget for financing project implementation and recurrent costs.  \n \n49.  Project Performance Monitoring System The PMU, with the help of an external \nindependent monitoring institution, will undertake a quantitative and qualitative performance \nmonitoring for each project component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the \nproject benefits accrued. The PMU, with the assistance of project-financed consultants, will \ndevelop comprehensive project performance monitoring system (PPMS) procedures and plans \nin accordance with ADB's standards, within 6 months after loan effectiveness. The PPMS is to \n ", " 14 \n \nbe reviewed and approved by ADB. The PlUs will assist the independent monitoring institutions \nto carry out PPMS activities. ADB and MH&PI will agree on the performance parameters to be \nmonitored during the project inception and will include the establishment of benchmarks for \nwater supply and sanitation improvements in the project areas and sector performance. \n \n50.  Baseline data collection will be carried out prior to the start of any construction under the \nProject and in conjunction with socioeconomic surveys and focus group discussions. It will then \ncontinue  on  a  regular  basis  during  project  implementation  until  3  months  after  project \ncompletion. The results will be presented to MH&PI and ADB independently, and incorporated \ninto the project progress and completion reports. \n \n51.  Project Review. ADB and the Government will jointly undertake annual project reviews \nto assess progress, and a comprehensive midterm review in the last quarter of 2005. The \nproject review will follow standard ADB procedures. The Government will ensure that the \nmidterm reviewers are informed of any policy or implementation changes affecting the local \ngovernments  and  the  urban  infrastructure  sector.  If  necessary,  the  midterm  review  will \nrecommend changes in design and implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the \nscope, design, and implementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed \nsince project appraisal; (iii) assess implementation performance against project indicators; (iv) \nreview and establish compliance with loan covenants; and (v) identify problems and constraints \nand, if necessary, recommend changes in the design or implementation arrangements.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n52.  Social.  The  Project\u2019s  targeted  unit  is  the  household,  but  because  women  are \ntraditionally responsible for cooking, cleaning, and taking care of the family and are highly \naffected by problems associated with water supply, they will be the main beneficiaries of the \nProject. The Project will reduce the time women spend fetching water, the burden of carrying \nheavy loads, and the time spent taking care of children suffering from waterborne diseases. A \ngender action plan, with specific targets, will be implemented to ensure that at least 50% of \nparticipants in community discussions and CBO committees are women and 25% of PIU \nmembers  are  women.  The  capacity  building  and  training  of  women  members  of  CBOs, \nPradeshiya Sabhas, NWSDB, and PIUs will enhance women's role in the sector. Women's \nparticipation in the CBOs and implementing units will provide them with greater voice in the \nplanning, implementation, and management of water supply schemes. \n \n53.  An indirect benefit of the Project will be its support to the ongoing peace efforts. The \nimplementation of the Project in Muttur and Batticaloa towns will require the collaboration of \nboth the Government of Sri Lanka institutions and the local communities. The cooperation \nneeded will provide a visible platform for the commitment to the peace process and will translate \nthe benefits of the peace process into specific improvements to the living conditions of the civil \npopulation, which has suffered civil unrest for the last two decades. The rural component will \nempower communities by involving them in the decision making process and transferring the \nassets and the responsibility for the O&M of the schemes to the CBOs. \n \n54.  Health.  Access to safe drinking water and sanitation will reduce waterborne diseases in \nthe general population, improving their health status. This benefit will accrue especially to \ninfants and children, who are more vulnerable and who suffer more frequently and more \nseverely  from  waterborne  diseases.  The  Project  will  significantly  reduce  infant  and  child ", "15 \nmortality, and malnutrition caused or aggravated by waterborne diseases in the project areas. \n \n55.  Economic.    The  Project  will  reduce  the  amount  of  resources  (time  and  cash) \nhouseholds spend to procure safe water. Other benefits will accrue from savings in number of \nwork days lost due to waterborne diseases and related medical expenditures. Direct benefits to \nthe economy through contracts and employment have been estimated to amount to $7.2 million. \nBasic infrastructure will increase the potential for private investment in the project areas and will \nindirectly benefit the local economy.  \n \n56.  Environmental.  With increasing population and growth of urban centers, increasing \npressure is placed on the limited aquifers if underground water continues to be the only source \nof water. Provision of piped water from surface sources will decrease the pressure on the \naquifers,  especially  in  Batticaloa  and  Muttur.  Provision  of  sanitation,  drainage,  and  waste \ntreatment will reduce domestic waste pollution. \n \nB.  Assumptions and Risks \n \n57.  Policy.  The  Project  assumes  a  stable  political  environment  and  positive  economic \ngrowth. A halt in the peace process, currently considered unlikely, is a significant risk as it may \nimpede the implementation of the Batticaloa and Muttur subcomponents. It is assumed that the \nimplementation  of  policy  reforms  will  continue,  including  the  development  of  a  regulatory \nstructure for the water sector under the public utilities commission and the introduction of private \nsector  participation.  The  institutional  strengthening  component  is  designed  to  support  this \nmomentum by strengthening the capacity of NWSDB to implement these policies in coordination \nwith other external agencies.  \n \n58.  Economic and Financial. The financial and economic viability of the Project assumes a \n2% growth in household income per year. Inadequate cost recovery and financial capacity and \ninadequate maintenance and asset management will risk the sustainability of the Project. Policy \nchanges affecting tariffs would pose a financial risk to the Project. Tariff settings need to be \ndriven by financial considerations and be independent of political influence.  \n \n59.  Moreover, tariffs and connection fees should be affordable to the intended beneficiaries \nto assure an optimal connection rate and tariff collection, which are the main sources of revenue \nfor the Project. Affordability is calculated as the percent of monthly household income spent on \nthe monthly water and wastewater bill. At the proposed tariff level (in 2008) the average monthly \nwater bill for a median and low income household will range between 2.4% and 2.7% and \nbetween 2.6% and 3.2% of household income, respectively. In all cases, this is considered well \nwithin generally accepted affordability levels. In accordance with NWSDB existing practice, it \nhas been assumed that the full cost of connection will be charged to the customer. The \nminimum cost of a connection is calculated to be SLRs8,100 per household. Full payment up \nfront will be an estimated 6.8% of annual income for a median income household and 13.5% of \nannual household income for a low income household. Payment in installments over 24 months \n(i.e.,  exclusive  of  financing  charges)  will  represent  3.3%  of  household  income  or  6.5%, \nrespectively. \n \n60.  Institutional Capacity.  Insufficient institutional capacity at the local government level \nposes a risk to the implementation of the rural component. Therefore, the Project will provide \ntraining and support to the Pradeshiya Sabhas. In addition, the Government will provide the \nnecessary budget allocations for the Pradeshiya Sabhas to have one technical officer to be \ntrained and to work full time in the Project. \n ", " 16 \n \n \n61.  Environment. The Project is in environmental category B. An initial environmental \nexamination was carried out for each of the project districts, and supplementary analysis is \nbeing carried out for the proposed augmentation of the Unnichchai Tank in Batticaloa, the \nborehole in Polonnaruwa, and the salinity barriers in Hambantota and Matara. The preliminary \ninitial environmental examination shows that adverse environmental effects will be limited and \ncan be mitigated through integrated corrective measures integrated in the project environmental \nmitigation plan. The examinations indicate that a safe, clean, and reliable water supply and \nimproved sanitation in urban areas will significantly improve public health and environmental \nconditions in the project towns.  \n \n62.  Communities  using  wells  for  water  supply  are  vulnerable  to  the  contamination  of \ngroundwater by the high density of latrines and septic tanks, and unsatisfactory drainage works. \nThe expansion of the water supply systems will reduce the need for some sections of the \ncommunity  to  continue  to  use  groundwater  and  the  awareness  campaign  will  educate \nbeneficiaries on how to mitigate this risk. To ensure that urban schemes deliver safe water, \neffective monitoring of treatment processes and O&M procedures, and daily chlorine residual \ntesting will be instituted and monitored by NWSDB. The treatment plants will produce very small \namounts of sludge over several years. The sludge is not toxic and will be disposed of safely.  \n \n63.  Mitigation measures have been proposed and with the findings of the supplementary \nstudies, these will be incorporated in the project design. Environmental management plans are \nproposed  for  each  project  component  to  the  NWSDB  district  offices  for  implementation. \nEnvironmental training programs will be provided for the staff of the PSIU and CBOs, to \nstrengthen  their  capacities  of  addressing  environmental  concerns  during  the  design  and \nconstruction phases of the Project. The contractors will be required to prepare and implement \ntheir own environmental management plans, and carry out the construction work in line with \ninternational standards. Other measures to be implemented as part of the Project include (i) \ncontrol  and  monitoring  of  activities  in  catchments  upstream  of  water  supply  intakes  and \nborefields, (ii) monitoring of water quality and quantity at water supply intakes, and (iii) licensing \nof wastewater treatment plants. Additional information is included in Appendix 13. \n \n64.  Water Rights. The Project has identified raw water sources required to supply water for \ndomestic use to the targeted populations. With the exception of Batticaloa, no conflict between \nexisting and new users has been identified. In Batticaloa, the Project will raise the Unnichchai \nTank to increase its storage capacity to provide sufficient water for domestic use and farming. \nThe construction of the Batticaloa water supply scheme involves raising the Unnichchai Tank \nbund and modifying the spill gates to increase raw water available for domestic consumption. \nInitial feasibility studies indicated that during the raising of the tank it may be necessary to lower \nthe  tank  water  level,  which  will  temporarily  deprive  rice  cultivators,  wage  laborers,  and \nfishermen in the Unnichchai area of income. The Project has made provisions for this event and \nconsultations have taken place with the affected people. On 6 June 2002, NWSDB discussed \nand distributed a draft compensation plan among the affected people and relevant stakeholders. \nNWSDB has consulted with affected farmers in Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa to obtain their \nconsent to use the water rights for drinking purposes. Additional information is included in \nAppendix 6. \n ", "17 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n65.

", "Appendix 2  23 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  Most of the piped water in Sri Lanka is supplied by the National Water Supply and \nDrainage Board (NWSDB). Consequently, the financial and operational efficiency of NWSDB \ndefines the quality of service in Sri Lanka and the sector\u2019s capacity for new investments. Finally, \nNWSDB has a major role in implementing new policies and starting the decentralization of \nservice provision to local authorities, the private sector, and community-based organizations \n(CBOs). \n \nA.  NWSDB Performance \n \n2.  A  financial  model  for  NWSDB  uses  NWSDB\u2019s  historical  financial  statements  and \nperformance targets as a basis for projecting water sales and revenues and operating costs. It \nreflects NWSDB ongoing capital projects and loan repayment obligations and incorporates the \ncapital cost and financing assumptions of the proposed Project. The financial model provides \nindicative targets for the tariff levels and financial and operational performance improvements \nnecessary to support the sustainability of existing investments, to meet debt-service obligations, \nand to satisfy the financial covenants of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n3.  NWSDB\u2019s  financial  performance  has  improved  as  a  result  of  increased  customer \nnumbers and improved technical performance. Revenue, since 1966, has been sufficient to \nmeet actual operation and maintenance (O&M) costs and debt service; and from 1997 through \nto 2001, NWSDB has achieved a cost recovery ratio of 1.0 as covenanted under its existing \nADB loan. These achievements recognize necessary adjustments to reflect the impact of certain \naccounting policies.1 Table A2.1 summarizes NWSDB\u2019s financial performance from 1996 to \n2001.  Despite NWSDB\u2019s improved financial performance to date, O&M is not regarded as \nadequate in many towns and debt-service obligations remain highly subsidized, with a high level \nof  grant  funding  provided  to  NWSDB.  Moreover,  except  for  some  modest  rehabilitation, \nrevenues from water sales remain inadequate to make any real contribution to future capital \nexpenditure out of tariffs and NWSDB continues to be heavily reliant on the Government and \nofficial development assistance funding for major capital works.  \n \nTable A2.1: Summary of NWSDB\u2019s Net Profit, 1996 to 2001 \n  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \nItem  Audited  Audited  Audited  Audited  Audited  Est. \nAs Presented             \nNet Profit  (312)  88  182  359  221  371 \nCRRa  1.0  1.2  1.2  1.3  1.2  1.2 \nAdjustedb             \nNet Profit  (341)  (57)  27  125  (34)  96 \nCRRa  1.0  1.1  1.1  1.2  1.1  1.1 \nNondomestic : Domestic  12.6  7.3  6.0  5.5  7.3  6.2 \nTariffc  \nCRR = cost recovery ratio, NWSDB = National Water Supply and Drainage Board. \na  Operation and maintenance costs plus the greater of depreciation or debt service. \nb  Adjustments involve adding back depreciation on grant-funded assets, and reducing capitalization of overheads \nby 50%. \nc  Ratio nondomestic (commercial) : domestic tariffs for 25 cubic meters (volumetric and fixed charges). \nSource: ADB and Government agreed performance targets. \n                                                 \n1  Head office salaries and planning costs have been overcapitalized, depreciation is not charged against grant-\nfunded assets, and a high proportion of assets remain in work-in-progress, further reducing depreciation actually \nexpensed.  \n ", "Appendix 2  24 \n \nB.  NWSDB Financial Viability \n \n4.  NWSDB prepared a tariff policy for drinking water that was endorsed by the previous \ngovernment. However, the policy limits the level of cost recovery that could be achieved by \nusers and does not adequately distinguish between cost recovery policies for what should be \nregarded as large urban centers such as Colombo, other urban centers, and smaller urban and \nrural centers. Nor are the affordability of service levels and technology options appropriately \ntaken into account in investment decisions, which ultimately impact the level of costs. Both need \nto be addressed to best ensure affordable tariff levels that can optimally support full cost \nrecovery and financially sustainable service delivery.  \n \n5.  Financial and operational performance covenants have been discussed with NWSDB \nand the following targets have been agreed:  \n \nTable A2.2: NWSDB Performance Indicators \n \nPerformance Indicator    2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \n1.  m3 Billeda (%)  Increase      5    4    3    2    1 \n2.

Under the technical support of the Project\u2019s institution strengthening component, \nNWSDB  will  review  the  tariff  strategy  and  develop  and  implement  a  strategy  to  transfer \nresponsibility of smaller water schemes (with less than 1,000 connections) to local government \ninstitutions, private sector, or CBOs to better ensure their cost effective operation. \n ", "Appendix 2  25 \n \n7.  Real increases in the tariff will be required and the Government has agreed to ensure \nthat tariff levels will meet at least O&M, depreciation, and rehabilitation cost. The affordability \nassessment  presented  in  this  section  suggests  the  proposed  tariff  levels  are  generally \naffordable in accordance with internationally accepted benchmarks. Timely public campaigns \nwill be critical to generate the support of key decision makers as well as general public support \nand willingness to pay. The Project provides resources for this activity. \n \n8.  Independent Regulation and Private Sector Participation. The establishment of an \nindependent regulatory structure for the water sector is currently under way. The Public Utilities \nCommission Bill has been approved by Parliament and commissioners are expected to be \nappointed by the end of 2002. The Commission will implement the regulations to be developed \nby the Ministry of Housing and Plantation Infrastructure under the water industry act.  \n \n9.  The private sector in Greater Colombo has successfully participated in activities such as \nmetering, billing, and collection. Outsourcing will be encouraged by the Project in all regional \nschemes and especially in those under the urban component. The Government is in the process \nof introducing private sector participation in the operation of some water schemes. In October \n1999, the National Policy on Private Sector Participation in Water Supply and Sanitation stated \neight  urban  water  supply  schemes  would  be  selected  as  pilot  projects  for  private  sector \nparticipation, and demarcated potentially profitable service areas for the Government to enter \ninto partnerships with the private sector for O&M and to extend water systems.2 \n \n10.  Decentralization to Local Government and CBOs.  Currently, local authorities have \nlittle capacity to implement their recent mandate to provide water and sanitation. Most local \ngovernments do not have the financial capacity to invest in water and sanitation, and many do \nnot even have the financial and technical capacity to operate and maintain the existing ones. \nNWSDB manages 99 water schemes with less than 1,000 connections and although it has tried \nto transfer them to local authorities, they have not accepted the responsibility. The small \nschemes have a higher O&M cost than large ones due to lack of economies of scale and higher \ncost of management if run by NWSDB, and should be transferred to local authorities, CBOs, or \nthe private sector. The Project provides support for these schemes to be rehabilitated and \ntransferred. \n \n11.  Rural  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation  Sector. The  National  Policy  for  Rural  Water \nSupply and Sanitation Sector, approved in 2001, indicates that rural sector activities should be \nbased on  participatory approaches. The role of Government, provincial councils, and local \ngovernment authorities should be to regulate and facilitate the implementation of the sector \nactivities  while  CBOs  and  the  private  sector  should  be  the  providers  of  services. \nNongovernment organizations are recognized as facilitators of water provision. Local authorities \nare also recognized as service providers when required. The policy recognizes water as an \neconomic good and indicates that users should bear the full responsibility of the sustainable \nO&M of facilities and assets and be encouraged to share the initial capital investment \n_________________________________ \n2   \nGovernment of Sri Lanka. 2002.

The percentage of \npoor households has fallen from 18.2% to 13.4% in urban areas from 1992 to 1996, and, in the same period, the \npercentage of poor households has declined in rural areas. Despite impressive achievements, poverty levels in \nSri Lanka remain high. Poverty is multifaceted and is manifested in the ability to afford basic consumption goods, \nand lack of access to basic needs such as safe drinking water, sanitation facilities, health care, and education. In \nrecent  years,  water-related  diseases  and  child  malnutrition  have  worsened.  Twenty-eight  percent  of  the \npopulation does not have access to safe drinking water and 24% does not have access to safe sanitation. There \nare regional variations in terms of dimensions to poverty with poverty levels in the northeast among the highest in \nthe nation. In some districts, including Muttur, over half of the rural population does not have access to safe \ndrinking water supplies. Inadequate sanitation infrastructure and access to safe drinking water in urban and rural \nareas are the leading causes of public health problems in poor communities.  \n \n  The 2002 Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Government of Sri Lanka states \u201cthe provision of safe \ndrinking water, and adequate sewage and sanitation systems, is frequently cited as the single, highest social \nservice priority by poor households.\u201d The strategy includes provision of water to 85% of the population by 2010. \nIn April 2002, the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed a poverty partnership agreement \nthat recognizes water supply and sanitation as a main strategy for poverty reduction.  \n \n  The proposed Project will provide safe drinking water to approximately 969,000 people and sanitation \nfacilities to 171,500 people, specifically to poor and low income households in rural areas of Anuradhapura and \nPolonnaruwa districts of North Central Province and in the towns of Batticaloa, Hambantota, Matara, Muttur, and \nPolonnaruwa.

Poverty Analysis \n \n \n  Poverty consultations carried out in Sri Lanka by the Poverty Impact Monitoring Unit on behalf of ADB \nindicate that the poor unanimously identify basic infrastructure, including water supply and sanitation, as a priority \nneed.  \n \n  The project area includes both urban and rural areas from east, south and north central regions of the \ncountry. There has been a significant deterioration in the general economic, social, and physical conditions have \ndeteriorated significantly in the northeast region over the past two decades due to ethnic conflict and war, and \npoverty is quantitatively and qualitatively different from that in other parts of the country. Although no official \nstatistics are available for this region due to the unfavorable security situation, the project socioeconomic surveys \nshow that in Batticaloa and Muttur in the Northeast Province, poverty is higher than in the rest of the country, \nthere is a high concentration of ethnic minorities, and health indicators are lower, and the situation is more acute \nin Muttur. Therefore, 74% of the capital investment of the Project will concentrate in the northeast, where \ninvestments in basic infrastructure have been arrested for the last 20 years and poverty is greater.  \n \n  In Polonnaruwa and Anurapurah districts, the poverty incidence is 8% higher than the national figure3 and \nis the third poorest province based on the higher poverty line. Within the districts, poverty is higher in the rural \nareas, which are targeted in the rural component. The Project will prioritize rural investments based on demand-\ndriven and need criteria. \n \n  Four of the five project districts are in the northeast and northcentral regions. In these four districts, 40\u2013\n45% of the people live below poverty line. Hambantota in the south has a high incidence of drought and limited \ngroundwater. Although income levels are similar to the national average, the population has to spend more than \nin other parts of the country to have access to drinking water. Lack of income, employment, and water are the \nmain concerns among the poor in Hambantota district. In low-density areas of Hambantota, the Project will use a \ncommunity-based approach (currently implemented by the Third Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Project) to \nreach communities. During implementation, special attention will be given to community participation to overcome \nthe lack of trust in the Government and nongovernment organization (NGO) efforts.4 \n  \n3\n  Poverty incidence based on the lower and higher poverty line in North Central Province is 31% and 47% respectively, \nwhile at national level it is 25% and 39%. \n4\n  ADB. 2000.

Potential Issues \n   Impact  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan Required \nResettlement    Not  Short resettlement \nThe Project will require the permanent acquisition of \nSignificant  plan \n10.0 hectares (ha) of land, of which 1.1 ha are owned \nby  National  Water  Supply  and  Drainage  Board \n(NWSDB), 1.4 ha private land and the rest by the \nGovernment. Land acquisition will not result in loss of \nlivelihoods or community resources. Temporary loss of \nlivelihoods may be incurred because construction in the \nUnnichchai Tank will affect approximately 4,000 people. \nA compensation plan has been prepared and disclosed \nto the affected people. \nGender    Significant  The  Project  will  benefit  women  in  several  ways:  (i)  Incorporated in the \navailability of safe drinking water in the household or  project design \n \nneighborhood  will  reduce  the  drudgery  of  women\u2019s \nSee gender action \nwork  associated  with  fetching  water  and  will  reduce \n \nwaterborne  diseases;  (ii)  at  least  50%  of  CBO  plan in Section E \nmembership  will  be  women;  (iii)  women  staff  of \nNWSDB  and  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  will  be  given \npreference for training under the Project; (iv) women \nwill be especially encouraged to apply for the project \nimplementation unit (PIU).  \nAffordability   Not  Subsidized  connection  for  recipients  of  the  Incorporated in \n  Significant  Government\u2019s social assistance program that provides  the Project design \n  some subsidized or free food and other basic services \nto poor people; provision of metered communal stand \npost taps in poor communities and markets; provision \nof affordable tariff for basic consumption (100 liters per \nperson per day).  \nLabor  Not  The Project will ensure fair wages for the laborer in the  Incorporated in the \n  Significant  construction works and that women and men get equal  project design \n  wages for similar work. The Project will monitor fair \nwages for the laborers, and equal wages for women \nand men laborers.  \nIndigenous People  Not  Two of the project areas (Muttur and Batticaloa) include  None \n  Significant  100% of the ethnic minority groups.  \n ", "Appendix 5  33 \nOther Risks/  Not    None \nVulnerabilities  Significant \n \nE.  Gender Action Plan \n \n  The Project recognizes that participation of women in decision making is important, as they are providers, \nusers, and managers of water at the household level. The woman is the best person in a village household to ask \nabout  the  quantity,  quality,  and  reliability  of  water  used  by  her  family.  The  Project  also  recognizes that \ncommunication and interaction with women are more effective when done by other women, and consequently it is \nimportant to include women in the implementation team. Therefore, the Project will actively encourage the \nparticipation of women as beneficiaries and implementers. \n \n  During social mobilization at selected villages, the importance of women participation will be explained to \nbeneficiary communities in village meetings, hygiene education, and all other project activities. The following targets \nwill be achieved in the implementation of the rural component: \n \n(i)  Project facilitators will emphasize the need to have active participation of all at community meetings, \nwhich will include 50% participation by women. \n(ii)  50% participation in small group activities will be by women. \n(iii)  The executive committee of the CBO will be at least 50% women. \n(iv)  Separate discussions with women\u2019s groups will take place regarding technologies and service level of the \nwater supply facilities built by the Project. If major differences occur between women\u2019s groups and mixed \nor men\u2019s groups, the Project facilitators will take an active role to prevent women's decisions being \novershadowed. \n \n  The Executing Agency will actively recruit qualified women in all levels of the project implementation \nstructure, especially in the rural component. The institutional strengthening component activities related to \ntraining will specify how participation of women will be encouraged. The following targets shall be achieved in the \nproject implementation and the institutional strengthening component. \n \n(i)  25 % of professional and technical level staff working in the project, project monitoring unit (PMU), project \nimplementation unit (PIU), Pradeshiya Sabhas, and counterpart NGOs will be women.  \n(ii)  On the institutional strengthening component, at least 20% by NWSDB professionals who participate in \nthe training subcomponent will be women. \n(iii)  In designing awareness campaigns about water supply and sanitation, the role of women in the \nhousehold for most of the provision and use of water will be taken into account. \n \n  The NWSDB and PMU will be responsible for developing and implementing the appropriate strategies \nand action plans to achieve these targets. NWSDB and the PMU will monitor these targets through the project \nprogress reports and the project benefit monitoring. \n \n ", "34  Appendix 6 \n \nSUMMARY SHORT RESETTLEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  For Temporary Loss of Livelihood \n \n1.  The Project will build, among others, a water supply scheme for Batticaloa to provide \npiped water to approximately 270,000 people. The construction of this scheme may require \nraising the Unnichchai Tank bund to increase raw water availability for domestic consumption. \nDuring construction, the tank water level may have to be lowered to below the level where the \ntank can provide water. This may deprive for one dry season the source of livelihood of 1,898 \nfarmers and 2,200 wage laborers who depend on the tank for irrigation, and 177 fishers who \nmay not be able to fish for one year. Although engineering solutions to avoid disrupting irrigation \nare still being explored, NWSDB has prepared a draft compensation plan in the event that the \npeople  will  be  affected  by  the  tank  augmentation.  The  objective  of  this  plan  is  to  set  a \nmechanism to provide fair compensation, as defined under and Sri Lanka National Involuntary \nResettlement Policy and the Policy on Involuntary Resettlement of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB), for any person who may lose all or part of her or his income due to the Project.  \n \n2.  Entitlements.  If there are any affected people, they will be entitled to compensation, \nincluding (i) male and female farmers, both owners and tenants, (ii) male and female wager \nlaborers, and (iii) male fishers. Affected people are entitled to be compensated for their losses \nand to be informed fully and consulted on compensation options. The assessment of the exact \nextent of cultivated land affected by the Project will be obtained from a special land assessment \ncommittee that will be formed. It will comprise a government agent or divisional secretary, \nAgricultural  Service  Committee,  farmer  organization,  and  the  Irrigation  Department  of  the \nNational Water Supply & Drainage Board (NWSDB). The land assessment committee will use \nthe  Paddy  Land  Register  as  the  bases  of  its  assessment.  The  estimated  total  area  is \napproximately 1,227 hectares (ha) during the dry season, which may affect approximately 3,687 \npeople. A detailed description of the current estimates is provided in Supplementary Appendix \nA. \n \n3.  Consultation, Participation, Grievances, and Public Disclosure.  After consultations \nwith the farmers and discussions with the project consultants and ADB officers, the Government \nprepared a draft compensation plan that summarized the actions that the Government and ADB \nare planning to put in effect to compensate the people affected by the raising of the Unnichchai \nTank. The draft plan was translated into Tamil and made into a simplified cartoon version. \nCopies were provided to the representatives of the affected farmers, wage laborers, and fishers. \nThe plan was discussed with the affected people on 6 and 7 June 2002. The affected farmers \nwere asked to raise any questions or concerns regarding the plan by 30 July 2002. \n \n4.  The plan will set the guidelines and process for delivering any required compensation. \nThe details of the compensation plan are not yet finalized, as it is important that the affected \npeople and the stakeholders participate in designing the final plan. Thus, the draft plan will \nestablish  two  local  stakeholders  committees  to  consider  compensation  entitlement  and \ngrievance  and  compensation  disbursement  procedures  (compensation  committees).  Both \nfemale and male representatives from the affected groups and from the stakeholders will be part \nof both compensation committees. The two groups should meet separately to assess their \nposition  without  undue  pressure  from  influential  persons  or  groups.  Once  their  individual \nstances  are  determined,  plenary  meetings  can  be  held  to  come  to  an  agreement.  An \nindependent and knowledgeable facilitator will be provided by the Project to participate in the \nmeetings and assure appropriate transparency and fairness of the process. The compensation \n ", "Appendix 6  35 \ncommittees, in coordination with the project monitoring unit (PMU), will decide upon the (i) units \nentitled to compensation (individuals vs. households); (ii) criteria to be entitled to compensation; \n(iii)  criteria  to  assess  due  compensation  amounts  for  each  affected  unit;  (iv)  monitoring \nmechanisms  to  assure  that  compensation  has  reached  the  intended  beneficiaries;  (v) \nprocedures  to  redress  grievances  by  people  regarding  entitlement  to  compensation;  (vi) \nmodality for payment of compensation (timing, kind or cash, etc); (vii) type of identification \nrequired to claim compensation; (viii) advance warning period needed by the different affected \ngroups before construction; and (ix) institutional arrangements for delivery of compensation. \n \n5.  Compensation.  The  Project  will  make  sure  that  people  receive  appropriate \ncompensation for any losses incurred due to the Project. The exact amounts will be agreed \nbetween the affected people and the committee with the assistance of a facilitator. Although the \ncompensation committee will determine the final amounts and type of compensation, the Project \nhas prepared estimates using data from adjacent areas and information from local people in \norder to prepare a budget to cover compensation. These estimates were revised with the \naffected people during consultations on 6 and 7 June 2002. Payment and disbursement of \ncompensation will be the responsibility of the Executing Agency (NWSDB) and the project \nimplementation unit (PIU).  \n \n6.  Institutional  Framework.  The  project  director  appointed  by  NWSDB  is  directly \nresponsible for paying the compensation to the affected people. The Batticaloa NWSDB, with \nthe  support  of  the  resettlement  specialist,  will  coordinate  day-to-day implementation and \nmonitoring of the plan, including participation in the committee meeting, collection of data on \naffected people, and disbursement of payments. NWSDB will be responsible for implementing \nthe final compensation plan.  \n \n7.  Implementation Schedule and Monitoring and Evaluation. The construction works \nshould be completed within 8\u201310 months to ensure water storage for the next year. Sufficient \nwarning will be provided to the affected persons of disruption to irrigation so they do not \nunnecessarily invest in crop inputs. In the 6\u201312 months leading up to civil works to raise the \nbund,  names  of  people  entitled  to  compensation  will  be  assembled  by  Project  and  the \ncompensation committee. NWSDB is responsible for carrying out overall internal monitoring and \nevaluation.  The  PIU  in  Batticaloa  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  and \nmonitoring. \nB.  For Land Acquisition \n \n8.  The Project will require the permanent acquisition of 10.0 ha of land of which 1.1 ha are \nowned  by  NWSDB,  7.5  ha  are  Government  owned,  and  1.4  ha  are  privately  owned. \nApproximately  seven  private  landowners  will  be  affected  by  the  Project.  NWSDB  will  be \nresponsible for carrying out all land acquisition activities and has prepared a plan according to \nthe National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB's Policy on Involuntary Resettlement. To \nestimate the budget needed for land acquisition, information regarding land market price in the \narea for similar landholdings has been used. Discussions have been held with the affected \nGovernment institutions and private owners.  \n \n9.  Objectives, Policy Framework, and Entitlements.  In adherence with ADB's policy, \nthe physical structures and pipes have been sited to avoid relocation of any permanent houses \nor structures or impact on land. Therefore, no people will be relocated. NWSDB will assure that \nthe  land  acquisition  procedures  for  project  activities  are  implemented  according  to  the \nprovisions set in the Short Resettlement Plan for Land Acquisition (SRPLA) and in accordance \n ", "36  Appendix 6 \nwith  the  National  Involuntary  Resettlement  and  ADB  policies.  Affected  people  have  been \nidentified by the Project and are entitled to compensation based on replacement value. \n \n10.  Consultation and Grievance Redress Participation. The SRPLA has been disclosed \nto all affected people and discussed with them. After submission by the Government, it was \nposted in ADB's web page for information. \n \n11.  Compensation. The Project consultants, the Government, and the consultations with \naffected people have confirmed that, as a result of the Project, (i) no structures or productive \nassets are in any of the land properties; (ii) no relocation or loss of income will result from the \nProject's land acquisition; and (iii) all of the affected people have legal titles to their lands, \nalthough, all landowners (with or without legal titles) are entitled to compensation for their land. \nValuation of compensation will be done applying the replacement value as defined by the \nGovernment in the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and by ADB's Resettlement and \nLand Acquisition Policy.  \n \n12.  Institutional  Framework.  The  PMU  in  NWSDB  is  responsible  for  the  overall \nimplementation  and  monitoring  of  the  land  acquisition.  The  NWSDB  district  offices  in \nTrincomalee  and  Hambantota  will  be  responsible  for  the  day-to-day  implementation  and \nmonitoring of the SRPLA. Project implementation units (PIUs) in Muttur and Hambantota will \ntake over these responsibilities once they have been established. The PMU and PIUs will be \nsupported by a resettlement specialist provided by the Project. In the PIUs, the NWSDB \nresident engineer will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the SRPLA and \ncoordinating with the resettlement specialist.  \n \n13.  The  PMU  will  proceed  with  land  acquisition  procedures as soon as the Project is \neffective. (i) When the title to the land is clear, a government evaluation will be prepared and the \nnegotiations with the owner will start. Negotiations will be conducted by NWSDB. (ii) The \ngovernment evaluation will be based in replacement value as defined in ADB's Involuntary \nResettlement Policy. Titleholders will be compensated for all permanent land losses at full \nreplacement cost. (iii) NWSDB will approve the earlier agreement reached between the owner \nand NWSDB. NWSDB\u2019s legal officer will execute the deed, and compensation will be disbursed \nby the PMU to the owner within one month of reaching the agreement. (iv) If agreement is not \nreached, NWSDB will resort to compulsory acquisition, in which the minister responsible for \nlands will issue an order under section 2 of Lands Acquisition. In such an event, NWSDB will \ncomply with the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and ADB policies and ensure that \nreplacement value is paid for the required land.  \n \n14.  Implementation Schedule, Budget, and Financing.  Land acquisition activities will \ncommence 1 month after loan effectiveness (April 2003). All land acquisition will be completed, \nincluding payment of compensation, before civil works contracts can be awarded. The Project \nhas allocated counterpart funding to finance the land acquisition. The PMU will be responsible \nfor disbursing compensation within 1 month of reaching a written agreement with the landowner.\n ", "Appendix 7  37 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n \nTable A7.1: Detailed Project Costs and Financing Plan \n($\u2019000) \n \n  ADB     Government Community \nForeign  Local  Total  Local  Local  Total \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Currency  Currency  Cost \n               \nA.

An economic and financial assessment has been undertaken of each of the town water \nsupply subcomponents and the Project as a whole. The economic internal rate of return and the \nfinancial  internal  return  (FIRR)  of  each  has  been  estimated,  and  a  sensitivity  analysis \nundertaken. In addition, the financial performance of National Water Supply and Drainage Board \n(NWSDB) has been evaluated to determine its ability to financially sustain project-developed \nassets subsequent to their completion. \n \nA.  Project Financial Analysis \n \n2.  The objective of the financial analysis is to ensure that each town subcomponent and the \nProject as a whole are financially viable; meaning that in each case they generate revenues \nsufficient to cover capital and operating costs and rates of return that meet or exceed the \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to finance each. Revenues are those derived \nfrom water tariffs and other related charges that are directly attributable to the project. The \nmajor assumptions employed in the financial analysis are as follows:  \n \n(i)  Scope. Only  incremental  revenues  and  costs  directly  associated  with  each \nsubcomponent and/or the Project have been considered. The revenue and costs \nof existing systems have not been considered.  \n(ii)  Cost Savings Due to Reduced Nonrevenue Water (NRW). The subcomponent \nwill rehabilitate portions of the existing transmission and distribution systems, \nresulting in a reduction in NRW and a consequent reduction in the required \nproduction per cubic meter of water sold and the unit cost of water sold.  \n(iii)  Forecast  Period.  The  FIRR  and  average  incremental  financial  cost  are \ncalculated from 2003 to 2050. \n(iv)  Price Basis. All revenues and costs are expressed in Sri Lankan rupees on an \nincremental basis in constant mid-2001 prices. They do not incorporate projected \ninflation over the forecast period. All foreign costs are converted to Sri Lankan \nrupees at an exchange rate of SLRs95 to US$1. \n(v)  Weighted Average Cost of Capital. The WACC is expressed in constant prices \nbefore tax. It is based on the cost of the capital for the subcomponents and the \nproject  respectively,  assuming  debt  at  an  interest  rate  of  10%  and  equity \nprovided by the Government, with an assumed no cost of capital as relevant. A \nlong-term domestic inflation rate of 6.5% is assumed in the estimate of the \nWACC.  \n(vi)  Domestic Consumption. This is estimated assuming water consumption of 100 \nliters  per  capita  per  day  and  an  average  household  size  of  five  people. \nHouseholds are assumed to connect to water supply progressively over the initial \nyears of the Project, with coverage based on an expected rate of connection \nuptake from 2003 in each town to 2025 and then remaining constant over the \nremainder of the forecast period. Nondomestic consumption is assumed at 30% \nof domestic sales. NRW is estimated at 25% of water production. \n \n3.  Proposed real increases in NWSDB domestic tariffs for the lowest consumption bands \nare approximately 50% per annum over the next 4 years, (i.e., 2003\u20132006), 10% for the \nsubsequent 2 years (2007\u20132008), and 5% for the next 3 years (2009\u20132011). No real increase is \nassumed in 2012. The increases result in NWSDB tariffs as set out in Table A8.1. \n \n4.  Capital costs are estimated for each project town and include physical contingencies, \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \ndifficult areas allowance, taxes, and duties. The construction period is estimated to be over the \nperiod 2003\u20132007, with plant commissioning in 2007 but 1 year later, in 2008, in Batticaloa.

Incremental salaries and wages are based on the expected increase in \nestablishment costs with the proposed Project. An allowance for growth in customer numbers \nand resulting metering reading and billing and other incremental costs has been assumed at \nSLRs0.5 per cubic meter for additional water production over the first year of operations and \nmaterial  expenses  are  based  on  a  percentage  of  gross  fixed  assets.

An  economic  assessment  was  undertaken  for  each  of  the  town  water  supply \ncomponents, for the rural water supply component, and for the sanitation components. For the \ntown water supply components, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) and the net present \nvalue were estimated and a sensitivity analysis undertaken. A poverty impact assessment was \nalso undertaken and the benefits accruing to the poor estimated. The rural water supply \ncomponent has a sector-like approach; as such, the specific investments will be identified in the \ncourse of the Project, and so a specific economic analysis is not possible at this stage. Instead, \nthe economic analysis considered least-cost technical options, and identified the kinds and \nscale of benefits that will be derived from the Project. The sanitation component is based strictly \non least-cost analysis of the minimally feasible alternatives. \n \n2.  The Project is estimated to benefit a total of 969,000 people in the project area. The \nestimated EIRR for the town water supply component varies from 12.7% to 17.2%, and the \nprojected EIRR for the rural water supply component is 13.0%. The poverty impact ratio varies \nfrom 0.54% in Batticaloa to 2.20% for the rural component. Potential health benefits of improved \nwater supply have not been explicitly taken into account, therefore overall benefits may be \nhigher than indicated in this analysis. Table A9.1 summarizes findings of the assessment.  \n \nTable A9.1: Summary of Economic Benefit Assessment \n \n  Number of  EIRR  NPV  Benefits to  PIR \nSubproject  Beneficiaries  %  (SLRs million)  the Poor  % \nBatticaloa Water Supply  270,600  17.2  976.79  524.0  0.54 \nHambantota Water Supply  107,700  12.7  43.12  89.6  2.08 \nMuttur Water Supply  52,900  13.9  71.2  73.4  1.03 \nPolonnaruwa Water Supply  84,100  14.3  40.95  67.8  0.77 \nRural Water Supply  322,000  13.0  2.9  595.5  2.20 \n  EIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, PIR = poverty impact ratio. \n  Source: ADB estimates. \n \nA.  Urban Town Water Supply \n \n3.  Existing Situation. Project towns (Batticaloa, Hambantota, Polonnaruwa, and Matara) \nare considered major regional centers in Sri Lanka. Muttur is a smaller secondary town. Their \npopulations range between just under 50,000 to almost 300,000. With the security situation over \nthe last 20 years, Batticaloa and Muttur are particularly disadvantaged. In terms of piped water \nsupply, in Hambantota approximately 30% of the population are served, less than 50% of the \nurban population is served in Matara and Polonnaruwa, and in Batticaloa and Muttur virtually no \nhousehold has access to properly treated piped water supply. Most people in project towns rely \non groundwater for drinking and cooking. Groundwater quality in the project areas is poor and \nhigh levels of fluoride are common in Anuradhapura, Hambantota, and Polonnaruwa. In the \nmore densely settled towns, there is concern regarding pollution of wells from nearby latrine \nsoakage pits. In addition, sand river extraction and upstream irrigation has caused increased \nsalinity in Matara and Muttur. Table A9.2 summarizes the situation found in each town.  \n ", "Appendix 9  43 \n \nTable A9.2:  Project Towns \nItem  Batticaloa  Hambantota  Matara  Muttur  Polonnaruwa \n2001 Population  257,804  89,967  286,791  45,279  60,083 \nPopulation Growth Rate  1.7%  1.8  1.5  1.5%  2.2 \nPopulation Without  96.8%  52.4%  51.5%  100.0%  70.0% \nPiped Water \nAverage Monthly  9,000  9,000  9,000  8,000  8,000 \nHousehold Income \n Source:  ADB estimates. \n \n4.  Economic Benefits. Future \u201cwith- and without-project\u201d situations have been compared \nto derive the marginal benefits in terms of resource cost savings and consumer surplus from \nadditional water use with the Project. The benefits of the water supply subprojects are the value \nof incremental water supply, and the savings of time and cost in fetching, carrying, pumping, \npurchasing, storing, and treating water. For households without pumps, which is the majority, \nsurveys in Batticaloa and Polonnaruwa indicated that households spend an average of 15 \nminutes per day collecting water for drinking and cooking. The economic cost of time was \nvalued at SLRs10 per hour, to which is added costs of replacement and repair of wells, bores, \njars, and buckets of SLRs475 per year. The Project is designed to provide up to 100 liters per \ncapita per day (lpcd), based on the Government service levels policy and the current average \nwater consumption in similar towns of 94\u2013127 lpcd. Surveys indicated that households currently \nuse up to 60 lpcd. Since the benefits of incremental water exceed the resource cost savings, a \nconservative assumption is to take the nonincremental water use at 60 lpcd. Nondomestic \nbenefits are assumed to be 1.25 times the domestic benefits per cubic meter. With nondomestic \nconsumption at 30% of domestic consumption, nondomestic benefits average about SLRs1,746 \nper household. \n \n5.  The Matara salinity barrier will not significantly increase the number of people connected \nto the system, but will improve the quality of water provided to current users, which currently \ndoes not meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards when salinity intrusion occurs at the \nNadugala intake. The discounted present value of losses from 1 day of salinity intrusion each \nyear is about SLRs2.6 million at 12% discount rate. An average of 50 or more days per year \nwould justify the construction of the salinity barrier at the present time. Currently, salinity \nintrusion takes place an average of 60 to 75 days a year, during the dry season. \n \n6.  Economic  Costs.  A  least-cost  assessment  of  project  options  for  each  town was \nundertaken.  The  assessment  was  based  on  preliminary  cost  estimates,  and  associated \noperations and maintenance (O&M) cost. Economic costs for the purpose of this assessment \nare based on those used for the financial analysis. Financial costs (capital investment costs and \nO&M) have been adjusted to economic costs by deducting duties and taxes (value-added tax \nallowed at 10%) and applying a shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11 to the foreign component, \nand a shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 to the unskilled labor. To convert financial costs to \neconomic costs, the overall adjustment factor is 0.82.  \n \n7.  Sensitivity Analysis. The sensitivity of the results was tested for different levels of \ncapital cost, O&M, and benefits. Table A9.3 summarizes the extent to which assumptions have \nto change in each town water supply subcomponent to drive the EIRR below 12%. The Project \nis most sensitive to the benefits accrued in the form of additional consumption and time savings. \nAn increase in O&M will not significantly affect any of the subcomponents, and changes in \n ", "44  Appendix 9 \nnondomestic consumption proved to have little or no impact on the EIRR.

Urban Town Sanitation \n \n8.  A least-cost analysis was done for each of the main urban sanitation activities, building \nof pit latrines for individual households without any sanitation, and a waste treatment plant for \nthe Batticaloa Hospital and prison. The proposed household sanitation for the urban component \nis the least-cost technology that meets the requirements of the Department of Health. The \nselection of beneficiaries and subsidy levels is the same as that used in the rural component; \ntherefore no separate analysis was undertaken. \n \n9.  Batticaloa Hospital has 3,282 people who use, work on, or stay in 60 buildings within the \n8 hectares property of the hospital. It is planned to increase the capacity of the hospital by 2003 \nwith additional nurses, housing, and wards. The prison houses 363 people. Batticaloa hospital \nand the adjacent prison currently discharge their sewerage into septic tanks, which need to be \nemptied periodically, and the septage is disposed of near the garbage dumpsite. The sludge \neffluent is disposed untreated into street drains, which flow into the Batticaloa Lagoon. Although \nthere are no national standards for discharge of wastewater from hospitals, main tolerance limits \nfor domestic effluents discharged into marine coastal areas are not met by the effluent from \noverflowing septic tanks. Because of the geology and the high density of population in the area, \nrehabilitation of the septic tanks would not meet the requirements for discharge. Although \npumping and treating the septage could be done, there is in Batticaloa no adequate septage \ntreatment available, making centralized treatment for the hospital the only alternative to ensure \nthe level treatment required for public health. \n \n10.  The  waste  treatment  plant  will  be  selected  based  on  least-cost  criteria,  with \nspecifications of the amount and quality of effluent to be treated and expected quality of the \ndischarge. With the increase enforcement by the Central Environmental Authority, a number of \nlocal firms have gained expertise in construction and maintenance of wastewater treatment \nplants, including package treatment plants, using anaerobic and aerobic treatments. Bidding for \nthis component will include evaluation criteria that emphasize capital cost investment as well as \nO&M to ensure that the least-cost technology is selected.  \n \n11.  Broad estimations indicate that the town sanitation activities will benefit 32,500 people in \nthe project areas. The economic benefits of sanitation activities are difficult to measure, but \ninclude improved health and welfare, as well as environmental benefits.  \n \n ", "Appendix 9  45 \nC.  Rural Water Supply and Sanitation \n \n12.  The rural component is based on a study conducted in 2001 conducted by Worley \nInternational of rural water supply and sanitation in Polonnaruwa district.1 The study included an \neconomic analysis, which is briefly described here. \n \n13.  Economic Benefits. The rural component targets 322,000 beneficiaries\u2014161,000 in \nPolonnaruwa and 161,000 in Anuradhapura. It is proposed that water supply be improved for all \nthese population, and latrines will be provided for 124,000 households.  \n \n14.  The economic benefits of rural water supply improvement have been estimated following \nthe standard approach, by quantifying the resource cost savings and value of incremental water \nuse provided by the Project. The average time needed to collect water was estimated at 30 \nminutes per day. Nonincremental water use was estimated at 68 liters per capita per day, and \nincremental water use was projected as 32 lpcd, giving a total water use under the project of \n100 lpcd. Cost savings resulting from reduced use of water storage containers was estimated at \nSLRs5 per household per month.  \n \n15.  The Project is expected to significantly improve the health of beneficiaries, both from the \navailability of better quality water, and from the provision of sanitation facilities. The health \nbenefits may be substantial, but they are difficult to measure, and so are not included in the \nbenefit-cost analysis. As such, the benefit-cost analysis provides a conservative evaluation of \nthe net benefits of the Project. \n \n16.  Economic Costs. The total capital investment cost proposed in the Worley report \nproject, including taxes and duties, and institutional development and including community \ncontributions, is SLRs1.678.5 billion, of which SLRs475 million are community contributions. \nO&M  costs  are  estimated,  on  average,  at  SLRs50  per  household  per  month.  Across  all \nhouseholds, this represents about SLRs36 million per year. Maintenance of assets is likely to \ncost SLRs20 million per year. Some of the subprojects will entail some pumping costs, but in \naggregate this will probably not exceed SLRs5 million per year. The financial cost estimate has \nbeen adjusted to economic costs by deducting all taxes and duties, then applying a shadow \nexchange rate factor of 1.11 to the foreign component and a shadow wage rate factor of 0.7 to \nunskilled labor.  \n \n17.  EIRR. The specific investments to be undertaken will be identified in the course of the \nProject, and so a specific estimate of the EIRR is not possible at this stage. But based on the \nprojected number of beneficiaries, and assuming a constant rate of completion until the end of \nthe Project, the EIRR for the Project would be 13%. In the rural component, the total capital \ninvestment per beneficiary is lower than that used by Worley International, mainly because of \nsavings gained in project management due to economies of scale. However, because the \nbenefits of both projects are expected to be the same, the EIRR for the Project should be \nhigher. \n \n18.  Sensitivity Analysis.  Table 9.4 shows the results of a sensitivity analysis. To drive the \nEIRR below 12%, capital costs would have to increase by 32%, benefits would have to be \nreduced by 36%, or the lifetime of assets would have to fall by 25%.

The \nreport was completed in January 2001. \n ", "46  Appendix 9 \nProject is therefore reasonably robust to adverse changes in the key components of the benefit-\ncost analysis. \n \nTable A9.4: Sensitivity Indicators and Switching Values \n \nParameter  Percentage  EIRR  NPV Before  NPV After  Switching  Sensitivity \nChange  Change  Change  Value (SV)  Indicator \n(SLRs\u2019000)  (SLRs\u2019000)  (SI) \nIncrease in \n+ 15 %  13 %  204,970  117,405  + 32 %  - 43 % \nCapital Cost \nReduction in \n-40 %  11 %  204,970  67,013  -36 %  -47 % \nBenefits \nReduction in \n-10 %  12%  204,970  123,009  -25 %  -40 % \nAssets Lifetime \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: ADB estimates. \nNote: NPVs and SVs are calculated at the 10% discount rate.  \n \n19.  Rural Sanitation. For the sanitation component, no useful data are available to estimate \nresource use savings in the without-project situation. However, an average willingness-to-pay \ncan be estimated, generally based on previous experience of sanitation developments in other \nareas  of  Sri  Lanka,  adjusted  as  necessary  to  take  account  of  specific  conditions  in \nPolonnaruwa. This willingness-to-pay can then be taken as an approximation of the benefits that \ncan be attributed from the sanitation component of the Project. The value of the sanitation \nbenefits is assumed to accrue on completion of the sanitation facilities. Latrine owners will need \nto pay (or contribute labor) for ongoing maintenance, cleaning (of pits) and upgrading of the \nfacilities. This has been estimated as SLRs350/year, equivalent to the construction cost of the \nlatrine  depreciated  over  10  years.  Given  that  materials  form  approximately  50%  of  the \nhousehold contribution and labor the remainder, the willingness-to-pay for sanitation facility \nconstruction is estimated as follows:  \n \n-   Materials contribution         SLRs1,750/household  \n-   Labor contribution SLRs1,750 x 0.65 SWRF2   SLRs1,140/household  \n-   Value of Sanitation Benefits       SLRs2,890/household  \n                                                 \n2   Shadow wage rate factor. \n ", " \n  \n \nURBAN  RURAL \n \nCOMPONENT  COMPONENT \n  \n \n \n  MH&PI   I\nNational  M\n  P\nSteering \nL\n  Committee  RWSS  E\n   NWSDB  DMivHis&ioPnI   FiguMEN\n  reTA\n \n  AT\n  NWSDB  10IO\n    RWSS  : ImN S\n  Unit  pT\nDesign &  PMU    lR\n  eU\nSupervisio PPCU  mC\n  n  eT\n  ntU\naR\n  tiE\n  on A\n N\n    StD\n  ru S\n  cC\n  TSUs  tuH\n    Flow of funds  reE\n D\n      U\nL\nCommunication & TA  E\n         \nii.

Introduction \n \n1.  An initial environmental examination (IEE) of the proposed Project was undertaken as \npart of the Secondary Towns and Rural Community-Based Water Supply and Sanitation Project \nto ascertain its impact on the environment and to identify measures to prevent or mitigate any \nadverse environmental impacts that could arise from its implementation.  \n \n2.  The  Project  is  categorized  as  a  \u201cB\u201d  Project  in  accordance  with  Guidelines  on \nEnvironmental Assessment of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A summary IEE can be \nfound in supplementary appendix B.  All the subcomponents are undertaken to improve the \nquality  and  security  of  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Most  IEEs  carried  out  for  each \nsubcomponent showed no significant environmental effect. Project activities that may have a \nmarginally significant effect, and the main mitigation measures proposed, are summarized \nbelow.  \n \nB.  Summary of Proposed Mitigation Measure \n \n4.  Batticaloa. The raising by 1.5 meters of the Unnichchai water tank could create conflicts \nwith other users. It is critical to ensure participatory planning to resolve issues and examine \nalternatives to minimize disruption to farmers. An extra 5\u201310 meters from the current inundation \narea will be flooded. A detailed IEE will be carried out, examining the site of the dam area, the \ninundation  area,  the  affected  cultivated  areas,  and  immediate  river  valley.  Any  mitigation \nmeasures ensuing from the IEE will be included in the environmental management plan (EMP) \nand implemented. \n \n5.  A wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 350 cubic meters per day will be \nconstructed for Batticaloa Hospital and the adjacent prison, which currently discharge their \nsewage and sullage effluent into Batticaloa Lagoon. Liquid biomedical waste is relatively small \nand  the  treatment  plant  will  have  the  appropriate  process  to  treat  it.  Under  Central \nEnvironmental Authority (CEA) regulations, the sewage treatment plant does not require a full \nIEE nor an environmental impact assessment (EIA) as its capacity is less than 500 cubic meters \nper day. A supplementary study will be carried out during detailed design to ensure that all \nmitigation measures are in place and a comprehensive EMP has been drawn up before an \nenvironmental protection license can be issued. \n \n6.  Muttur. High turbidity levels during the wet season and possible contaminants such as \nagro-chemicals may present a problem at the intake site. A long term water quality and quantity \nmonitoring program should be implemented at the proposed intake site, particularly for low flow \nevents.  Elephants  frequent  the  intake  site  during  the  dry  season;  therefore  the  intake \ninfrastructure will need to be designed to minimize potential damage to it by elephants. Special \nconsideration should be given to keeping workers and elephants apart during the construction \nperiod.  \n \n7.  Polonnaruwa. Agro-industrial activities and uncontrolled solid waste management in the \nParakrama Samudra catchment area could pollute the tank water. Intermittent algal bloom have \nbeen seen. NWSDB will engage the assistance of CEA and local catchment management \nagencies to develop and implement appropriate catchment and water source improvement \nstrategies and a long-term water quality and quantity monitoring program.  \n ", "Appendix 13  57 \n \n8.  Though most of the proposed project infrastructure is in urban areas, well away from any \nhistorical  monuments  or  other  related  sites,  two  structures  (water  treatment  plant  and  2 \nkilometers of transmission line) will have to be carefully sited. The Archeological Authorities and \nthe Road Development Authorities have given their clearance for the two structures and it has \nbeen agreed that NWSDB will work closely with them to ensure that all appropriate and \nnecessary protective measures are in place to avert any damage to historical or archeological \nmonuments. \n \n9.  Hambantota. Upstream rice mill discharges into the Walawe Ganga and the presence of \nagro-chemicals are the main water quality concerns. Close monitoring by NWSDB and the CEA \nwill be required to prevent any upstream pollution of the raw water sources. NWSDB should \nparticipate in the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka\u2019s Walawe Ganga catchment management \nprocesses and establish a long-term water quality and quantity monitoring program. \n \n10.  Increased water extraction could allow saline water to intrude upstream from its existing \nlimit.  The  detailed  design  will  determine  whether  a  salinity  barrier  will  be  required  for \nHambantota. Should this be the case, a full IEE will be undertaken to ensure that all alternatives \nhave been investigated.  \n \n11.  Matara.  The  Matara  salinity  barrier  is  specifically  designed  to  enable  raw  water \nextraction to continue during low flow periods, which means that the flow of fresh water \ndownstream will be reduced. A conflict could arise if the reduction causes environmental flow in \nthe Nilwala Ganaga to drop to a level that results in adverse downstream environmental effects. \nCEA, in accordance with the National Environmental Act, has requested that a full IEE be \nundertaken to ensure that all alternatives have been investigated. The supplementary study will \nbe submitted to CEA and ADB for approval for the construction of the salinity barrier. \n \n12.  Rural Component, North Central Province. The schemes for the rural component will \ninclude small elements such as dug wells, tubewells, rainwater collectors, and latrines. These \nschemes will  have  no  significant  environmental  effects.  A  selection  criteria  for  the  small \nschemes has to be established. Once the communities and the type of scheme have been \nselected, a screening will be done to determine whether an IEE or EIA is required. Based on the \nresults, an EMP will be drawn up to ensure that all mitigation measures are in place and \nimplemented.  \n \n13.  General  Potential  Environmental  Impacts.  All  sludge  generated  by  the  water \ntreatment plants will be treated on site, and not off-site discharges will occur. To ensure the \nintegrity of the treated water quality, all water storages will be roofed and ventilated, and the \nsystem operated to ensure that the distribution system is maintained under pressure. To ensure \nthe health and safety of workers  and the public are not affected by the Project, appropriate \ndetailed design and EMPs are to include a safe working environment to international standards, \ncoupled with appropriate training in chemical handling and mechanical, electrical, and system \noperations.  \n \n14.  During  construction,  there  will  be  some  minor  and  temporary  disruption  to  the \nsurroundings and environment. Potential environmental issues include soil erosion, siltation and \nincrease in runoff, waste and effluent from temporary construction camps, noise pollution, air \npollution from dust, and increased traffic congestion. These issues will need to be minimized \nthrough  an  EMP  for  each  subcomponent  at  the  detailed  design  stage.  All  mitigation \n ", "58  Appendix 13 \nrequirements will be included in the contract document  for the contractors, and for sensitive \nareas a performance bond system might be included. \n \n15.  Effective monitoring of treatment processes, operation and maintenance of procedures \nand  daily  chlorine  residual  testing  will  be  instituted  to  ensure  safe  water  is  delivered. \nMicrobiological testing of treated water will also be done periodically. Structured and planned \npreventive maintenance programs will be developed for all facilities constructed under the \nProject.  \n \nC.  Institutional Requirement and Environmental Monitoring Program \n \n16.  NWSDB will be required to commission a detailed EMP for each project component. \nImplementation  of  mitigation  measures  for  the  protection  of  the  environment  prior  to \nconstruction will be the responsibility of NWSDB and its district offices. A project environmental \nofficer will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of these measures; liaising with \nlocal community groups, the CEA, and relevant agencies such as the Archeology Department \nand the Department of Wildlife Conservation; gathering baseline data; and providing technical \nsupport.  Implementation  of  mitigation  measures  during  the  construction  stage  will  be  the \nresponsibility of the contractor. An environmental engineer, who will be hired as part of the \nconsultant team for  implementing the Project, will assist NWSDB in preparing contractual \ndocumentation so that the bidding documents, bills of quantity, and other contractual obligations \nof  contractor  clearly  identify  environmental  responsibilities  and  describe  penalties  for \nnoncompliance. The environmental reports will be submitted to local environmental agency \noffices if present and to CEA if not, according to the engineering phases of plant construction \nand  pipe  laying.  NWSDB  will  be  responsible  for  overall  environmental  monitoring  and \nmanagement. The project implementation units and local government implementation units will \nbe responsible for sending quarterly reports to the project monitoring unit, which will be in \ncharge of consolidating the data and sending it on to ADB. \n \nD.  Conclusion \n \n17.  The  Project  will  improve  the  health  and  sanitation  of  the  communities.  The  IEE \nconcludes that an EIA will not be necessary based on the findings that the Project will not cause \nsignificant environmental problems and the potential adverse impacts are manageable through \nproper policy, planning, public relations, and good construction and supervision practices. CEA \napproval is being sought for a number of subcomponents where detailed IEEs are currently \nbeing  prepared.  The  Project  has  sufficient  contingencies  should  CEA  require  additional \nmitigation measures to be put in place. However, no work will commence until the appropriate \napprovals from CEA and relevant authorities have been sought and granted.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R355-02 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030107144456Z", "Title": "R355-02", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 4.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030120150527+08'00'"}}
