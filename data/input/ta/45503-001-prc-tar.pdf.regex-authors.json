INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the 2011 country programming mission, the Government of the People's Republic \nof China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nfor Developing a Legal System for the Credit Market.1  A reconnaissance mission was fielded on \n9 March 2011 and a fact-finding mission for the TA visited Beijing on 26\u201329 April 2011. An \nunderstanding  was  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.2  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC's legal system has created a solid foundation for the operation of the financial \nmarket. This is impressive given the age of the legislation, much of which was first approved in \nthe early 1990s. The recent plans to amend the General Rules of Lending, Rules of Deposit \nInsurance, Bankruptcy Law Ordinance on Bankruptcy of Financial Institutions, and others are \nexamples of ongoing legal and regulatory development. The establishment of a multilevel credit \nmarket is a keystone of the PRC's financial market development and legal system reform. \n \n3.  The  2008  financial  crisis  encouraged  the  PRC's  regulators  to  consider  further  the \nimportance of systemic security for the financial market. While the PRC\u2019s financial system \navoided direct negative impacts of the crisis, the lessons learned helped define flaws in the \nfinancial market environment. These weaknesses include the inadequacy of mechanisms for \nliquidation of insolvent or bankrupt financial institutions; and lack of clear definition, legitimacy of, \nand effective regulatory framework for the credit market. \n \n4.  Recognition of the legal status of the credit market and development of a suitable \nregulatory system has been an issue for many years. As a high-savings society, the PRC has \nsignificant amounts of funds seeking investment opportunities. Savers facing strict controls on \ninterest rates seek alternatives to bank deposits, government and corporate bonds, and the \nvacillating values of equity markets. Restrictions in the structure of the credit market have \ncontributed to the predominance of the state-owned banking system, which caters to large-scale \nstate-owned enterprises. Without clearer legal definition and recognition of the credit market and \nprovision of a broader range of credit services from a wide variety of financial institutions, such \nactivities had to be largely carried out in the gray area between the approved pilot experiments \nof microcredit financing and illegal, Ponzi-type money pooling schemes. Despite the recent \nemergence  of  city  commercial  banks,  microcredit  companies,  village  banks,  and  other \ninstitutions, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and rural households still face severe \nconstraints on credit access due to the lack of legal definition and rules on market conduct. \n \n5.  The PRC State Council and the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) have paid close attention \nto  maintaining  financial  security  and  enhancing  the  credit  market.  Accordingly,  PBC  has \ndeveloped regulations for deposit insurance, the exit of financial institutions from the market, \nand  macro-prudential  issues.  The  State  Council  and  PBC  have  modified,  enacted,  and \npublished numerous regulations since 1996. Legal changes are generally based on the review \nof specially permitted experiments with financial products and services. Pilots are allowed, on a \nvery small scale, to determine the usefulness of innovations before legal changes are made to \nallow their expansion. From 2005 to 2010 PBC, the China Banking Regulatory Commission, and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 June 2011. \n2  A memorandum of understanding for the TA was signed with the People\u2019s Bank of China and the Ministry of \nFinance on 17 May 2011. \n ", "2    \nlocal governments provided numerous opportunities for experimentation with new institutional \nforms\u2014such as microcredit companies and rural village banks\u2014and with various types of credit \nservices\u2014such  as  microcredit,  group  guaranteed  credit,  and  cash  flow-based  loans.  The \nacademic  community  and  research  institutions  have  been  carefully  considering  the \neffectiveness and results of these institutions and products. Researchers have demonstrated \nthe effectiveness and improved outreach of pilot credit products and services to target groups. \nIn particular, the pilot work has promoted the growth of SMEs and helped provide limited \nservices to lower-income households in rural areas. \n \n6.  Certain problems do exist in the credit system as currently defined in the law, which the \nextensive pilot work has helped define. The PRC's credit-related legal system so far has been a \ntransplant from external legal systems, which has created certain difficulties in interpretation and \nuse. For example, the nature of credit is not defined, since the existing legislation has led to \ndifferent interpretations of the legal definition of credit. In addition, it is unclear how credit should \nbe regulated (and by which agency), how to ensure universal use of and information sharing by \ncredit bureaus, how to regulate the secondary market for loan resales, what responsibilities \nexist for consumer protection, and how to handle over-indebtedness.  \n \n7.  The next step in modernizing the legal structure is the establishment of a clear definition \nof formal credit and its operations in the market, as opposed to household members sharing \nfunds or other informal financial arrangements that may not need regulation. In addition, setup \nof a tiered institutional structure for the PRC's credit market is important, so that institutions can \ntransform and add services\u2014with stronger regulation\u2014as they grow. This requires revisions in \nthe legal system governing credit delivery, repayment, and operations of credit providers. In \naddition,  a  fundamental  decision  must  be  made  on  whether  credit  will  be  regulated  by  a \nseparate market-conduct regulator or added to the current responsibilities of PBC, the China \nBanking Regulatory Commission, and other regulators. If these steps are not taken, risks of \nincreasing debt stress in certain segments of the market, suboptimal competition and potentially \npredatory  practices,  misallocation  of  credit  between  market  segments,  and  enforcement \nproblems may emerge. \n \n8.  Prior  experience  in  legal  reform  and  drafting  in  the  PRC  is  instructive,  particularly \nscholarly assessments such as that of the 5-year legal drafting project financed by the United \nNations  Development  Programme  (UNDP),  which  assisted  the  development  of  22  priority \nfinancial  laws.  The  methodology  for  legal  development  involves  (i)  assessment  of  key \ninternational jurisdictions to determine which are most relevant; (ii) a focused study tour that \nlooks closely at the context of relevant legislation and the positive and negative effects in \nselected countries, as well as implementation of the law; (iii) assessment of the specific issues \nin the PRC, analyzing what difficulty the new law is expected to address, the context and \nbehaviors of various persons who engage with the issue (in this case, borrowers and lenders); \nalternative legal options with costs and benefits for the various market participants; and (iv) how \nthe laws can best be implemented and adjusted as needs become known.3 \n \n9.  In Premier Wen Jiabao\u2019s presentation of the Twelfth Five Year Plan to the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress on 7 March 2011, the seventh of the eight key areas was \u201cDeepen Opening-\nup Policy\u201d. Specific steps under this area\u2014which reinforce the importance of this TA\u2014include: \n(i)  improve socialist democracy and the socialist legal system;  \n                                                \n3  A. Seidman and R. Seidman. 1996. Drafting Legislation for Development: Lessons from a Chinese Project, The \nAmerican Journal of Comparative Law. Vol. 44, pp. 1\u201344. See in particular pp. 22\u201324, from which this paragraph is \nclosely drawn. \n ", "  3 \n(ii)  accelerate the reforms of the fiscal, taxation, and financial systems; and \n(iii)  develop a financial system that is diverse, efficient, prudently regulated, and risk-\ncontrollable. \n \n10.  The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan outlines the strategy to develop an early warning and \nresponse  mechanism  for  financial  crises  and  to  specifically  improve  financial  legislation, \nincluding credit law. The Commercial Bank Law will be revised and new regulations such as \ndeposit insurance rules and financial institution exit rules need to be developed to rectify certain \nsystemic flaws and weaknesses in the financial market. This requires not only developing new \nlaws, but also reviewing the existing laws and regulations on the issue. New laws as well as \nsuggested amendments will create internal legal consistency and avoid conflict between laws. It \nalso requires a careful assessment of the context of credit markets and the participants to \ndetermine  the  best  legal  mechanisms  for  good  market  behavior  and  the  development  of \nadequate institutions and rules. \n \n11.  The TA directly supports the process of enabling full legislation to facilitate expansion of \npiloted  institutional  and  product  innovations  in  the  credit  market  in  accordance  with  the \napproved plan. The PRC country partnership strategy 2008\u201320104 provides for support to a xiao \nkang society through inclusive growth and environmental sustainability.5 ADB has committed to \nsix key areas of support. Governance engagement includes legal and regulatory reform, and the \nenabling environment for private sector reform includes finance sector reform. \n \n12.  The TA builds naturally on prior ADB work on legislation, which includes 26 TAs or \nproject components for $13.3 million equivalent over the last 25 years. ADB\u2019s Law and Policy \nReform program in the PRC from 1993 to 2003 facilitated the development of commercial and \neconomic laws. The work resulted in adoption of the Securities Law, Trust Law, Company Law \n(amendment), Bankruptcy Law, and legal adjustment relating to antidumping, countervailing \nduties, safeguards, import and export of goods, Foreign Trade Law, and cross-border merger \nand acquisition, upon accession to the World Trade Organization. Since 2003, ADB\u2019s Law and \nPolicy Reform has focused on competition policy and laws, development and reform of financial \nmarkets, including asset-based securitization, and development of the capital market.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The proposed impact of the TA is a legislative structure for a multi-tiered credit market \nconsistent with international standards, adapted to the needs of the PRC\u2014as shown in the \npassage, by the end of 2017, of legislation defining credit and governing key aspects of entry, \noperations, exit, and oversight of financial institutions delivering credit. The outcome is an \nestablished legal basis for credit definition, market entry, delivery, trade, and exit of financial \ninstitutions at the national and local government levels\u2014as shown in the completion, by the end \nof  2013,  of  the  legal  framework  and  drafting  instructions  for  credit  services  and  related \ninstitutional arrangements.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  This policy and advisory TA will help modernize legislation that governs credit markets in \nthe PRC by responsibly expanding access to credit services, particularly in rural areas and for \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nSMEs.

The TA team will (i) complete analytic \nstudies of credit legislation in key international jurisdictions and provide a study tour to the most \nrelevant location; (ii) conduct a national review and consult with formal and informal lenders, \nregulators, and other stakeholders to see what lessons have been learned and what changes \nmay encourage formalization, expansion of services, and consumer protection; (iii) assess the \ncurrent legal and regulatory systems to determine which improvements are most appropriate, \nand combine with results from (i) and (ii) to provide a policy approach and drafting instructions \nfor legal changes; and (iv) share the proposed results at an international conference to allow \nvalidation and further input before finalization. \n \n15.  The key outputs for this TA are the following:  \n(i)  financial  and  legal  assessment  of  existing  credit  market  circumstances  and \nmarket conduct, legal and regulatory barriers to responsible delivery of credit, \nparticularly to rural households and SMEs, with a technical note as a knowledge \nproduct; \n(ii)  selective review of legal structures governing credit delivery in key jurisdictions; \nwith  analysis  of  a  number  of  areas\u2014both  developed  and  developing\u2014for \npotential lessons, followed by a short and focused study tour to the most relevant \nlocation; \n(iii)  assessment of and recommendations for legal changes to improve (a) the PRC's \ncurrent legislation, precedents, and legislative proposals for credit definition; (b) \nestablishment  of  financial  institutions  providing  credit;  operation  of  such \ninstitutions; (c) secondary market for trading of loans; and (d) bankruptcy and \nclosure of financial institutions providing credit; and \n(iv)  an international conference with key stakeholders to validate recommendations \nin (iii) above for the proposed legal framework for the credit market, and to \nsuggest any further revisions. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $525,000 equivalent. The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $450,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The  TA  will  cover \nremuneration,  travel,  and  per  diem  of  consultants,  as  well  as  training,  workshops,  and \nmiscellaneous expenses. The TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with  ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010).  The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The  TA  is  expected  to  begin  in  August  2011  and  end  in  January  2013,  with  an \nimplementation period of 17 months. The executing agency for the TA is the Legal Affairs \nDepartment of PBC. Given the wide-ranging issues, other ministries and offices are expected to \nbe  consulted,  such  as  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission, provincial financial markets departments, the State Council Leading Group on \nPoverty Alleviation and Development, and the Civil Affairs Ministry. The executing agency will \nprovide office space, counterpart staff, transportation, logistical and travel arrangements to the \nconsultants, and will arrange meetings with relevant agencies and organizations. \n \n18.  The  consultants\u2014one  international  (4  person-months)  and  one  national  (9  person-\nmonths)\u2014will be individually selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and arrangements satisfactory \n ", "  5 \nto ADB for the engagement of national consultants. Equipment (one computer and software, a \nhigh-speed internet connection, and a printer with scanner) will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and remain with the \nexecuting agency at the end of the TA period. The outline terms of reference for consultants is \nin Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The TA team, along with the executing agency, will conduct and document a start-up \nnational conference with key stakeholders to discuss the status of the PRC's credit market, the \nresults of previous pilots, issues, legal and regulatory constraints, lessons learned, and policy \nissues. Further research and interviews on the domestic credit market structure and operations \nwill result in a report and technical note knowledge product for wider reading. The countries \nmost likely to offer useful background on the legal framework and regulatory options will be \ndetermined  and  their  markets  and  lessons  assessed  in  a  detailed  study.  A  policy  note \nknowledge product will accompany this second report. Based on the report and dialogue with \nthe executing agency, a study tour will be undertaken to assess experiences of modern credit \nlegislation and enforcement that are particularly relevant to the PRC.  Alongside these activities \nthe TA team will collect data and assess the status of current PRC legislation, regulation, \njudiciary decisions, and other determinations governing credit. Findings will be synthesized in a \nthird and final report with specific recommendations for legal changes and reform\u2014including \nlaws that need amending or drafting, drafting instructions, and an overall policy approach. A \npolicy note will also be produced as a knowledge product. The PRC stakeholders' review of all \nmaterial will be followed by an international conference to review, comment on, and suggest \nimprovements and implementation of recommendations. \n \n20.  In addition to the main outputs, the consultants will submit to ADB and the executing \nagency (i) an inception report two weeks after commencement of services; (ii) interim progress \nreports at appropriate stages during TA implementation; (iii) the draft final report before the \nconclusion of the contract; and (iv) revised final report two weeks after receiving and taking into \naccount the comments of, and feedback from, the executing agency, other stakeholders, and \nADB. All reports will be submitted in English and Chinese.  \n \n21.  The executing agency and ADB administration missions will regularly monitor and report \non major project activities. Consultants\u2019 reports will be presented in workshops and seminars \norganized for the validation of findings. Reports will be made available on ADB websites in \nEnglish and Chinese, if appropriate, and published whenever warranted. The three knowledge \nproducts will be made available to the public after executing agency clearance. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Developing a Legal System for the Credit \nMarket, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  and Indicators   Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nLegislative structure for  Passage of legislation  NPC information releases  Final legislation will be \nmulti-tiered credit market  defining credit and  on legislation passed;  integrated into existing laws to \nconsistent with  governing key aspects  State Council  ensure orderly market entry, \ninternational standards  of entry, operations,  confirmation of PBC  exit, trade of loans, and market \ndeveloped  exit, and oversight of  regulations  supervision. \ncredit-delivering \nfinancial institutions by \nend 2017  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nLegal basis established for  Legal framework and  PBC proposal to State  Supervision structures \ncredit definition, and  drafting instructions  Council  proposed will be affordable and \nmarket entry, delivery,  proposal for credit  will encourage responsible \ntrade, and exit financial  services and related  market growth. \ninstitutions at the national  institutional   \nand local government  arrangements  Risks \nlevels  completed by end  Legislation meant to formalize \n2013  the large informal credit market \nwill stifle innovation. \n \nLegal reforms may be delayed \ndue to fears that credit \nliberalization will enable \nexploitation of borrowers and \nmarket instability.  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.
