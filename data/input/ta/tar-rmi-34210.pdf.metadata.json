Since 1996, the Asian Development Bank has been providing continuing assistance to \nthe Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI) to help reform the public sector \nand  the  economy.1  This  assistance  has  included  increasing  attention  to  improving  the \nenvironment for private sector development. At the request of the Government, a private sector \nassessment was completed,2 and technical assistance (TA) supporting legal and regulatory \nreform3  has  been  initiated  within  a  regional  framework.  The  private  sector  development \ncomponent of the country strategy and program update for the RMI has been substantially \nguided by these efforts. Two ongoing TAs are also having a significant impact on the business \nenvironment,  i.e.,  the  Land  Registration  Authority  (LRA)  TA  and  the  joint  ADB/Foreign \nInvestment Advisory Service regional TA to address administrative barriers to private sector \ndevelopment (footnote 2). An ADB mission was fielded from 25 March to 6 April 2004 to \nundertake TA fact-finding.4 The Government and ADB reached an understanding on the goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, and financing arrangements during TA \npreparation. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Increasingly,  Pacific  developing  member  countries  are  utilizing  private  resources  to \nsatisfy the considerable demand for social, financial, and physical infrastructure, which cannot \nbe  met  by  the  public  sector  alone.  Central  to  good  governance  and  responsible  fiscal \nmanagement are measures to shift performance risk away from the general public to private \nparties, where these parties, be they small or large, foreign or domestic, are better able to \nmanage risk and deliver service. \n \n3.  Policy dialogue on developing the private sector has been carried out during private \nsector assessments, TA reviews, and the country strategy and program update process. As a \nresult of these consultations, the RMI Government and ADB agree on the importance of private \nsector development in the context of overall development strategies and priorities, resulting in a \nstrengthened role for private sector development in the country strategy. \n \n4.   The Government and ADB concur that the key to private sector development is an \nenabling environment that provides for competition, productivity, and the efficient delivery of \ngoods and services that meet the needs of the population. Under these conditions the private \nsector  is  able  to  generate  broad-based  growth,  broaden  consumer  choice,  and  generate \nopportunities for all people, especially the disadvantaged. Accessible and transparent property \nrights systems\u2014comprising laws, institutions, and information systems harmonized with local \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 1996.

Technical Assistance for Diagnostic Studies for Secure Transactions Reforms in the Pacific Region. \nManila (TA 37658-1-REG for approval December 2004). \n4 The Mission comprised Steve Pollard, principal economist and RMI desk officer, Pacific Department, and Graham \nSettle, senior corporate governance specialist, Regional and Sustainable Development Department. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 February 2002. \n ", " 2  \npractice  and  custom\u2014are  a  hidden  infrastructure  that  enables  actions  leading  to  the \nachievement of sustainable development goals.6 \n \n5.  The Government can play a key role in setting clear and unequivocal rules and allowing \nthe private sector to manage the best way to meet demand as well as bear the risk of failure. \nThe most salient elements underpinning the enabling environment are (i) sound rules for the \nmarket, (ii) the expectation that the rules will be adhered to by both market participants and the \nstate, and (iii) private property rights. \n \n6.  Progress has been made in recent years in simplifying the regulatory environment for \nbusiness  in  the  RMI  under  ADB  regional  TA.7  Foreign  business  license  registration  has \nimproved, business registration has been simplified, and a land registration agency has been \nestablished to allow investors easier access to land for investment. Procedures for employing \nforeign workers still require simplification and improvement. The administrative barriers working \ngroup set up under the TA is collaborating with the Government to streamline these procedures. \nThus far the Government is evaluating this TA as a success.  \n \n7.   The lack of secure real estate property rights is a hindrance to (i) establishment of \nefficient  property  markets  and  productive  use  of  land,  (ii)  timely  implementation  of  public \nprojects that require land acquisition, (iii) sound environmental stewardship of resources,8 and \n(iv)  provision  of  finance  and  establishment  of  an  evolving  capital  market.  Enhancing  the \nenvironment for private sector investment, job creation, growth, development, and reduction of \nhardship are central to ADB\u2019s country strategy for the RMI. \n \n8.  LRA is now established9 and requisite legislation has been approved. LRA has the \ncapacity  to  record  ownership,  leases,  and  mortgage  instruments.  A  mission  statement, \nmanagement  infrastructure,  operational  procedures,  and  an  outreach  program  have  been \ndelivered. While this TA has been successful thus far,10 further assistance is needed to ensure \nthe implementation and give promise to the long-term benefits of land reform.11 \n \n                                                 \n \n6  United States Agency for International Development. 2002.

Manila. \n8  Recent studies have shown that effective property rights can yield improvement in the natural environment. Efforts \nto conserve natural and cultural sites and to develop tourism around such sites are often at odds with the activities \nof local residents. The same can be said of projects to extend roads and pipelines or to foster sustainable \nextractive industries. To lessen the potential for conflict caused by such activities\u2014and to promote economic \ngrowth  with  environmental  stewardship  that  will  safeguard  the  world\u2019s  biodiversity\u2014the  property  rights  of \nindigenous and other community groups must be clarified and strengthened so that they can manage their \nresources in a sustainable way. United States Agency for International Development. 2002. Promoting Effective \nProperty Rights Systems for Sustainable Development.  Washington, DC. \n9 The RMI Parliament has enacted the Marshall Islands Development Land Recording and Registration Act. This \nlegislation was a component of the Public Sector Reform Program policy matrix. The act provides for LRA \nestablishment, operation, and procedures, and establishes legal requirements for valid land leases in the RMI. The \nGovernment appointed the LRA board and approved a budget for operations in FY2004. A new Real Property \nMortgage Act 2004 was prepared and has been passed by Parliament; the 1987 Real Property Mortgage Act was \nrepealed.  \n10  According to the 9 January 2004 International Monetary Fund Staff Report for the Article IV Consultation, \u201cOn \nprivate sector development, a welcome measure was the recent passage of legislation to address land tenure \nissues, including establishing the [LRA], \u2026improving laws relating to real property mortgages\u2026These measures \nshould help to lower intermediation costs and facilitate the reorientation of commercial bank lending activities \ntoward the private commercial sector.\u201d \n11 For example, the existing land tenure system in the RMI remains complex and entrenched in traditional and \ncustomary rights that are protected by the Constitution (Article X). \n ", "      3\n9.   The  need  to  resolve  land  conflicts  and  to  facilitate  the  gradual  and  sensitive \nsecuritization of real estate property rights to foster private investment is a key concern of the \nregion. Solutions can only be country-specific, but the results of further RMI TA will nevertheless \nbe of interest to all other countries in the region. This is an issue that has unfortunately been \npreviously  overlooked  as  too  sensitive,  too  political,  and  too  difficult.  It  has  therefore  not \nreceived the attention that it deserves. \n10.  The  issue  of  collateral  is  one  of  significant  economic  importance.  When  borrowers \ncannot use their assets as collateral for loans and cannot purchase goods on credit using the \ngoods themselves as collateral, interest rates on loans tend to be higher to reflect the risk to \nlenders.  In  many  developing  countries  where  legal  and  regulatory  constraints  make  using \nmovable property as loan collateral difficult, the cost of loans makes capital equipment more \nexpensive for entrepreneurs relative to their counterparts in industrial countries; and businesses \neither postpone buying new equipment or finance it more slowly out of their own limited savings. \nSmall businesses, in particular, are hit hard by the scarcity of low-cost financing, but the whole \neconomy suffers because the lack of new investment dampens productivity and keeps incomes \ndown.  \n11.  An important and often overlooked benefit of a property registry is the fundamental value \nadded in any transfer of ownership. This is important in real estate as well as well as goods and \nservices because the transfers facilitate more productive uses by both buyer and seller, even if \ncredit is not involved. For example, a landowner may not have the expertise to develop a \nparticular property, but would find productive use for the proceeds of a sale to a person with the \nrequisite knowledge and initiative. The buyer\u2019s plans anticipate greater value in the productive \nuse of the land than the monies paid to the seller. Both buyer and seller benefit in the exchange. \nTrade between individuals in their pursuit of productive goals under the rule of law is the \nessence of private sector contribution to improved conditions for people. When the transfer of \nownership is clear and efficient, the parties are free to concentrate on entrepreneurial planning \nand implementation.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The  primary  long-term  goal  is  to  foster  an  enabling  environment  for  productive \nopportunities, transactions, and capital formation for private sector development leading to \nbroad-based growth and an increase in the standard of living. The private sector development \nsocial impact will eventually (i) provide greater means for people to access quality physical and \nsocial infrastructure, (ii) improve capital formation, (iii) provide environmental stewardship, and \n(iv) support the overall reduction of poverty. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is \nincluded in Appendix 2. The TA will also eventually help to stabilize the economic outlook by \nreducing uncertainty and risks associated with asset ownership and transfer, facilitate lower cost \ncredit,  and  improve  private  sector  development  by  lengthening  investment  and  business \nplanning horizons. \n \n13.  The TA will help create an environment conducive to private investment and productive \nemployment by freeing up assets that are currently underutilized due to lack of a movable \nproperty  registry.  The  TA  is  expected  to  simplify  public  sector  land  transactions,  increase \nadministrative efficiency, and therefore reduce the burden and potential for poor investment of \npublic and private resources. The TA will also provide assessments and guidance for the \nGovernment for efficient land use, including consideration of land reclamation. \n \n ", " 4  \n14.  The TA will augment and support existing organizations and institutions. The TA consists \nof three complementary components: \n \n(i)  Land Registration Authority. The continued success of LRA will be supported \nas implementation and capacity building aspects have reached a critical stage in \ndevelopment.  The  component  will  simplify  private  and  public  sector  land \nownership, transactions, and the use of secure titles as security for finance.12 \nThis component will include a sensitive study of status and trends of land tenure. \n \n(ii)  Commercial  Registration  Authority.  This  complementary  component  will \nestablish movable asset ownership registration, simplify ownership transfer, and \nallow the private sector to use secure titles as security for finance. \n \n(iii)  Administrative Barriers Working Group. The initial success of the regional TA \n(footnote 7) will be supported as implementation needs to be continued. This \ncomponent  will  help  RMI  stakeholders  further  reduce  legal  and  regulatory \nimpediments to private sector development and allow for innovative solutions to \nbe presented in an effective and inclusive manner. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  Methods of institutional analysis and formulation of mission statement, organizational \nstructure, management infrastructure, operational procedures, and progress monitoring and \nreporting  will  be  based  on  internationally  proven  techniques.  Methods  of  land  titling,  land \nregistration, and land lease databases can also be based on established practice. However, no \nperfect models exist for further development of real estate property rights. The next stages must \nbe based on a gradual, sensitive, and well-informed process. Awareness raising and consensus \nbuilding are important components that require the continued assistance of the TA. The precise \nactions and inputs to facilitate this process will also have to be developed over time. With the \nexception of the land study, all components of the TA will be implemented on an intermittent, \nperiodic basis following a work program and over 4 years. \n \n16.  The  TA  is  expected  to  result  in  successful  testing  and  adjustments  to  the  legal, \nregulatory,  and  institutional  efficacy  of  land  reform  laws;  testing  and  adjustments  to \norganizational and human resource requirements of LRA; establishment of the legal, regulatory, \nand institutional system of movable property laws and the commercial registration authority \n(CRA);  and  commencement  of  a  program  to  increase  public  awareness  of  the  value  of \nregistration and securitization of property rights to the future of the RMI. In addition, the TA will \nestablish  a  forum  to  disseminate  solutions  to  challenges  faced  by  the  private  sector,  and \nguidance for further development and use of real estate and movable property rights. With the \napproval of Government, the TA results will be presented to and discussed in a variety of \nforums including the Cabinet, National Coordination Committee, and special land workshops. \n \n                                                 \n \n12 Some of the critical aspects of land registry sustainability are addressed in Hernando de Soto: 2000 The Mystery of \nCapital\u2014Why Capitalism Prevails in the West and Fails Everywhere Else, New York, Basic Books. Hernando de \nSoto argues that the most successful property systems are those modeled on informal systems\u2014systems that \npeople understand and that work. One of his key tools is to document the processes to undertake tasks both in the \nformal and informal sectors. In all these activities he believes the starting point is gathering data about the \ninefficiencies in the formal sector and the operation of the informal sector.  \n \n ", "      5\n17.  Assumptions  and  risks  include  traditional,  customary,  sociopolitical  commitment  to \nprivate property rights and administrative reforms, and adequate budgetary contributions from \nthe Government, including provision of suitable staff. These concerns were addressed during \nTA  preparation  through  extensive  consultations  at  all  levels  of  government  and  society, \nincluding the piloting of participatory processes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $950,000 equivalent, including $678,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $272,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$760,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and the local currency cost of \n$82,000 equivalent.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. \nThe Government will finance the remaining local currency cost corresponding to $190,000 \nequivalent. The cost estimate and financing plan is attached as Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  Ministry  of  Justice,  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordinating,  monitoring,  and  supervising  all  TA  activities;  providing  administrative  and \ncounterpart support to the consultants and coordinating the Government\u2019s response to the \nfindings and recommendations of the TA. The implementing agencies will be (i) LRA for the LRA \nand  CRA  components;  (ii)  Ministry  of  Resources  and  Development  for  the  Administrative \nBarriers Working Group; and (iii) the Economic Policy, Planning, and Statistics Office of the \nOffice of the President for the land study. \n \n20.  The TA will commence in or around March 2005 and be implemented on an intermittent \nbasis over 48 months. A team of five international consultants and two domestic consultants will \nbe recruited under the management of a consulting firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants using the simplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based \nselection method. A total of 25 person-months will be required for this TA (19 international and 6 \ndomestic). The consulting team will include an international team leader and private sector \ndevelopment  expert  (7  person-months),  an  international  technical  filing  archives  expert  (3 \nperson-months),  an  international  secured  transactions  expert  (4  person-months),  an \ninternational administrative barriers facilitation specialist (3 person-months), international social \ndevelopment analyst (2 person-months), a domestic social development analyst (3 person-\nmonths),  and  a  domestic  legal  expert  (3  person-months).  The  consultants  will  produce \ninception, annual, draft final, and final reports on their assignments and will submit these reports \nto the CRA, LRA, Ministry of Justice,, Administrative Barriers Working Group, Economic Policy, \nPlanning, and Statistics Office , and ADB, as relevant. The team leader will be responsible for \ncoordinating an annual survey of business activity in the RMI, and for reporting on the same in \nthe annual report, to help monitor TA progress. The outline terms of reference for the consultant \nteam for each phase are in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $760,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  Marshall  Islands  for  Improving  the  Environment  for  Private  Sector \nDevelopment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n       \nGoal       \nEstablish an environment conducive  Broad indications of  Annual business   \nto productive use of resources,  greater private sector  survey report by team \nefficient transactions, productive  activity including an  leader including \nallocation of capital, and credit  increase in business  telecommunication and \nformation for higher and better uses  licenses, land and  Internet connections, \nof land and movable property, and  movable asset  job advertisements, \nmore competitive business  registrations, capital  national statistics on \nenvironment.  formation, private  business start-ups and \nsector employment,  asset registrations, \nand private sector  labor survey data, \ncontribution to gross  capital formation, and \ndomestic product  private sector and \nfinancial assessments  \nPurpose      Government\u2019s continued \nAugment and support successful      commitment to reform of \nongoing reform efforts and additional      the Land Registration \nsecured transactions capacity to      Authority (LRA), \nenhance private sector      commercial registration \ndevelopment.      authority (CRA), and \n      Administrative Barriers \n      Working Group reform \n      package and increased \n      performance \n      measurement  \nOutputs       \n(A) Land Registration Authority        \nSimplified land ownership,  Increased number of  LRA databases for  Creditor and private sector \nmortgage, lease, and other land  recordings,  land registration, and  support and acceptance of \ntransactions;
