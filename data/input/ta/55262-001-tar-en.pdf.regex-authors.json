THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has taken a high toll on India. The country \nhas reported over 33.5 million confirmed cases, second largest after the United States as of 21 \nSeptember 2021.1 The country faced a devastating second wave starting March 2021, with a \nrecord high of 414,188 new COVID-19 cases on 7 May 2021. Despite the containment measures, \nincreased testing capacity (over 2.2 million samples per day) to detect and isolate cases, and \nnational vaccination drive, the possibility of a third wave looms high due to highly contagious \nvariants.  \n \n2.  The pandemic affected the poor and vulnerable population disproportionally, not only \neconomically but also in terms of health and well-being. Due to the pandemic, access to several \nhealth services declined because of diversion of resources to pandemic response and fear of \ninfection and mobility restrictions. Facility-based outpatient care declined by 33% and inpatient \nby 21% when compared to pre-pandemic levels.2 There was a staggering 22% decline in the \nnumber of institutional deliveries elevating the risk from infection and maternal complications from \nunsafe delivery methods.3 Social distancing measures and closure of social services such as for \neducation also caused high burden, especially on women. During the pandemic, women's share \nof unpaid care work grew by nearly 30%.4 Further, its negative mental and physical health impacts, \nespecially on vulnerable population groups such as migrant population and old persons, will \nrequire longer-term health system responses. \n  \n3.   COVID-19  impact  on  the  health  system.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  has  placed \nenormous strain on the health care delivery system in India, exposing long-standing gaps and \nexacerbating chronic inequities. These include (i) ongoing challenges in dealing with rising \nnoncommunicable  diseases  (NCDs)  in  addition  to  persisting  and  emerging  communicable \ndiseases like cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes are the major NCDs in \nIndia that kills around 4 million Indians annually, and most of these deaths are premature,5 given \nthe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, those with underlying conditions, particularly NCDs, are also \nat increased risk of mortality during hospitalization; (ii) insufficient good quality primary care \nservices and lack of effective referral systems for identifying and triaging potential COVID-19 \ncases, ensuring early diagnosis, helping cope with their anxiety, and reducing the hospital service \ndemand; (iii) difficulty in leveraging private sector capacity at affordable costs, especially for the \npoor\u2014the pandemic exposed exorbitant and inconsistent billing in the private sector;6 and (iv) \ndisparity in health system capacity across different states with lack in public health facilities and \nhuman resources.

The sudden unprecedented surge \nin cases, particularly during the second wave resulted in an acute shortage of medical oxygen, \nthe single most important intervention for moderate and severe cases of COVID-19\u2014with \nseveral Indian states reporting dire shortage.8  \n \n4.  Government initiatives. The National Health Policy 2017 envisages the attainment of the \nhighest possible level of health and well-being and universal access to good quality health care \nservices.9 The National Health Mission (NHM) aims to strengthen the public sector service \ndelivery systems since 2005, and it has been instrumental in improving state level health systems \nas per the national norms while encouraging innovations and performance of states moving \ntowards the achievement of universal access to equitable, affordable, and quality health care \nservices that are accountable and responsive to people\u2019s needs.10 In 2018, to drive forth the \nuniversal health coverage agenda, the government operationalized Ayushman Bharat Yojana \nwith  two  sub-components\u2014health  and  wellness  centers  (aimed  to  provide  comprehensive \nprimary health care) and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (aimed to provide health insurance \ncoverage for secondary and tertiary care needs among the poor). However, interstate variations \nin capacity, fiscal space, and governance quality have led to varying impacts of these initiatives.11   \n \n5.  Specific for pandemic response, the government announced the COVID-19 emergency \nresponse and health system preparedness packages. Phase 1 was approved in March 2020 for \n$2.05 billion and Phase 2 in July 2021 for $3.17 billion.12 Several development partners, including \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB), have supported Phase 1 of the project.13 In addition, the \ncontinued  pandemic  has  led  the  government  to  take  a  longer-term  approach  for  system \nstrengthening. The government launched the Pradhan Mantri Atmanirbhar Swasth Bharat Yojana \n(PM-ASBY) in May 2020 to develop capacities of health systems and institutions across the \ncontinuum of care at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels to respond effectively to the current \npandemic while building resilience for future emergencies. The PM-ASBY will be implemented \nfrom FY2021 to FY2026 and will cover (i) continued COVID-19 emergency responses; (ii) \nstrengthening public health infrastructure for pandemic preparedness at the state level; and (iii) \nstrengthening national systems for pandemic and health emergencies.14 These components have \nambitious  outcomes,  which  can  only  be  achieved  with  substantial  progress  in  states,  and \ntherefore, the capacities of the states must be strengthened by creating relevant policy conditions \nand undertaking a strategic approach towards implementation.  \n \n8  Government of India, MOHFW. 2021.

Manila. More details are available in the Development Coordination (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2 of the Report and Recommendation of the President). \n14 Key elements of strengthening public health infrastructure include setting up rural and urban health and wellness \ncenters, block public health units in economically weaker states, and integrated public health laboratories in all the \ndistricts and critical care hospital blocks in high burden districts and government medical colleges. In addition, the \nscheme has specific support to national systems including bio-security preparedness and research, strengthening \nports of entry, health emergency operation centers and mobile hospitals, surveillance of Infectious diseases, and \noutbreak response and critical care hospital blocks in central hospitals. The government requested ADB to support \nPM-ASBY with $1 billion, to be processed in four phases, with the first phase approved in December 2020. \n \n ", "3 \n \n6.  ADB support to the health sector in India. ADB has been a key partner in supporting \npandemic response and strengthening health systems. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2018\u2013\n202215 supports expansion of public health service delivery in urban areas with a focus on the \npoor and vulnerable. In December 2020, ADB approved a $300 million loan to strengthen \ncomprehensive primary health care in urban areas under PM-ASBY.16 In addition to the loan, a \n$2.9 million technical assistance (TA) grant from ADB\u2019s Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction ($2.0 \nmillion) and High-Level Technology Fund ($900,000) will support program implementation and \ncoordination, capacity building, and innovation, especially in states with lower performance. This \nsupport builds on ADB\u2019s previous support to urban health system strengthening under NHM \namounting to $300 million.17 ADB was a key partner in supporting COVID-19 response efforts \nthrough a COVID-19 Pandemic Response Option with a loan of $1.5 billion (footnote 13). ADB \nalso extended a $3 million grant to support strengthening of points of entry and enhance disease \nsurveillance under the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund.18 In July 2021, ADB approved a TA \nof  $7  million  to  strengthen  availability  of  oxygen  supplies  and  vaccine  deployment.  The \ngovernment also requested ADB to support vaccine procurement efforts with $1.5 billion under \nthe Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility.19 \n \n7.  Lessons  and  value  addition.  The  government  has  appreciated  the  design  and \nimplementation of ADB\u2019s prior TA,20 which provided strategic technical inputs through resource \npersons and expert consultants. Two key lessons emanated from the previous TA implementation. \nFirst, it is important to enhance the capacity of executing and implementing agencies in ensuring \nquality project design, effective project implementation, and overall portfolio performance. ADB \ncan add value in terms of sharing lessons across projects, introducing innovative approaches, \nstrategic planning, and implementation support in selected states. Second, ADB is in a strategic \nposition  to  provide  integrated  and  coordinated  technical  inputs  to  enhance  multisectoral \nengagement, in line with the vision laid out in ADB Strategy 2030 and bringing in financing plus \nelement in ADB operations. ADB can promote synergy, effective implementation, expanded \nprivate sector participation, and enhanced relevance and quality of health services, all of which \nwill lead to the outcome of a stronger and healthy workforce to support national economic goals. \n \n8.  Rationale for a transaction technical assistance facility. ADB is expanding its health \nsector portfolio in India. The proposed transaction TA facility will support policy dialogue, project \npreparation, capacity building, due diligence, and improved readiness for pipeline projects that \nare included in the indicative country pipeline,or other possible future pipeline projects as agreed \n \nwith the Department of Economic Affairs  (DEA),  Government  of  India.21 The TA facility will \nsupport strategic policy advisory and technical inputs on a range of health issues, strategy \ndevelopment, policy formulation, financial management, engineering and procurement, quality \nassurance, and evaluation of ongoing implementation efforts. It will build on the finance plus \nelement by bridging capability gaps, applying best practices, and fostering innovative solutions \n \n15 ADB. 2017.
