THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Shaanxi Accelerated Energy Efficiency and \nEnvironment Improvement Financing Project.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will establish a clean energy financing platform (CEFP) to channel \nfinance to clean energy investments in Shaanxi Province. In addition, to support the high-impact \nenergy efficiency and emission reduction initiatives in large enterprises, the platform will also \nfocus on directing investments to small and medium-sized enterprises (SME). \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  National plan for energy savings and emission reduction. The PRC is the largest \nenergy consumer in the world. In 2014, it accounted for 21% of global energy consumption.2 \nThe highly energy-intensive and coal-dominated economic structure has taken a heavy toll on \nthe PRC\u2019s natural environment and has become the major cause for the country\u2019s high levels of \ngreenhouse gas emissions and air and water pollution. To tackle this problem, the Government \nof the PRC has made promoting environmentally sustainable growth a key priority. \n \n4.  The  PRC\u2019s  Thirteenth  Five-Year  Plan,  2016\u20132020,  contains  specific  measures  and \ntargets to decouple economic growth from energy consumption and carbon emissions, boost \nthe share of nonfossil energy in primary energy consumption, and reduce the release of major \nair pollutants.3 These targets will contribute to the PRC\u2019s nationally determined commitment to \nreducing the carbon intensity by 60%\u201365% by 2030, compared with 2005, and achieve carbon \npeaking  by  2030  or  earlier.  The  national  energy-saving  targets  were  disaggregated  and \nallocated  to  the  provinces.  The  government  is  providing  additional  incentives  to  western \nprovinces that are heavily dependent on coal and energy-intensive industries to reduce energy \nintensity. \n \n5.  Energy savings and emission reduction in Shaanxi Province. Shaanxi Province, \nlocated in the western part of the PRC, is a major producer of coal, oil, and natural gas, and its \nindustrial structure heavily relies on these fossil fuels as feedstock and as an energy source. \nAlthough the province reduced its energy intensity by 16.3% during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015, and industrial energy intensity by 18.6%, this was achieved by mainly targeting \nlarge enterprises. Shaanxi Province aims to reduce energy intensity by an additional 15% by \n2020, compared with 2015. It has significant untapped opportunities to reduce the energy \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  International Energy Agency. 2016. Key World Energy Statistics. Paris.  \n3  Reduce energy intensity by 15% and carbon intensity by 18% (energy use and carbon emissions per unit of gross \ndomestic product) by 2020, compared with 2015, and increase the share of nonfossil fuel in primary energy \nconsumption from 12% in 2015 to 15% by 2020, and reduce the share of coal in primary energy consumption from \n66% in 2015 to 62% by 2020.

Outline of the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China. Beijing (adopted in 2016). \n \n  \n \n ", "2 \nintensity and air pollution caused by SMEs because these were not targeted under the Twelfth \nFive-Year Plan. \n \n6.  Many SMEs in Shaanxi Province are engaged in energy-intensive industries such as \ncoal based chemicals, nonferrous metals, ceramic materials, building materials, and industrial \nwaste  recycling.  What's  more,  they  rely  on  traditional  and  particularly  energy-intensive \ntechnologies.  While  SMEs  have  significant  scope  to  reduce  their  energy  intensity  and  air \npollution by recovering waste heat from industrial processes and making use of industrial gases \nfor productive purposes, their lack of knowledge about such technologies, weak understanding \nof cost\u2013benefit evaluation, and difficulties in accessing commercial credit have kept them from \nseizing these opportunities. Energy service companies (ESCOs), which are more familiar with \nmodern technologies and the packaging of energy efficiency investments, are particularly suited \nto drive energy efficiency and technology enhancements in SMEs. However, ESCOs are an \nunderdeveloped industry in Shaanxi and also find it difficult to access commercial credit. \n \n7.  Shaanxi Province also intends to increase the installed capacity of renewable energy \nfrom 7.5 gigawatts in 2015 to 20 gigawatts by 2020, to diversify its electricity generation mix and \ngenerate about 19% of total electricity from renewable sources. Most of the capacity addition is \nlikely to be from distributed renewable energy applications, such as solar photovoltaic plants \nlocated in barren lands with low agricultural productivity and the use of geothermal and biomass \nfor heat supply. \n \n8.  Energy efficiency hurdles in Shaanxi. Despite the past progress in reducing energy \nintensity,  further  improvements  are  difficult  because  the  recent  policy  approach  to  more \nmoderate economic growth in the PRC and the sharp reduction in prices for coal and coal-\nbased  industrial  products  have  eroded  the  profitability  and  creditworthiness  of  industrial \nenterprises, which in turn undermines their willingness to borrow and invest in energy efficiency \nimprovements. This, combined with the government\u2019s efforts to move away from providing direct \nfiscal subsidies to energy efficiency investments and instead enable local financial institutions to \nprovide suitable financing tools and financing products, hampers further investment flows into \nenergy efficiency efforts by large industrial enterprises and SMEs alike. \n \n9.  Financial barriers to energy efficiency investments. Although investments in energy \nefficiency improvements offer attractive returns, SMEs and ESCOs find it difficult to mobilize \nfinancing for such investments for the following reasons: \n(i)  Commercial banks are reluctant to finance discrete and small investments by \ndifferent enterprises.  \n(ii)  SMEs are reluctant to pledge their limited assets to borrow for relatively small \nenergy efficiency investments. \n(iii)  Taking security over the energy efficiency assets is difficult because of their \ndispersed nature. \n(iv)  Investments are relatively small but technically complex. \n(v)  Banks are unfamiliar with structuring cash flow-based, limited-recourse financing \nfor energy efficiency investments. \n \n10.  The proposed CEFP in Shaanxi Province is designed to help overcome the financial \nbarriers faced by SMEs and ESCOs.  \n \n11.  Rationale for financial intermediation loan modality. The government requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to design the project and to establish the provincial CEFP so \nas to mobilize domestic financing for investments in energy efficiency, distributed renewable \n ", "3 \nenergy,  and  environmental  improvements  in  Shaanxi  Province  by  leveraging  ADB  loan \nproceeds. The financial intermediation loan (FIL) modality enables ADB and the government to \nestablish partnerships with local commercial banks and financial institutions so as to channel \nfunding resources to small or medium-scale clean energy investments for which the financing \nrequirements are not large enough to warrant direct lending by ADB. ADB funds will leverage \nfinancing  from  participating  commercial  banks  and  other  financial  institutions,  and  enable \nfinancing of eligible energy efficiency investments on commercial terms. \n \n12.  Innovative  features  in  project  design.  The  proposed  CEFP  will  offer  three \ncomplementary financial products: (i) debt financing facility to provide entrusted loans,4 (ii) credit \nguarantee facility to leverage cofinancing, and (iii) lease financing facility for the purchase of \nenergy efficient industrial equipment. The CEFP will partner with two commercial banks active in \nShaanxi Province to offer entrusted loans, and the partner banks are encouraged to provide \ncofinancing to match at least the ADB loan proceeds. The guarantee facility will provide credit \nguarantees to technically sound subprojects with high energy-saving potential but lacking in \ncollateral to meet the requirements of the commercial banks for the provision of cofinancing. \nThis facility is likely to be particularly useful for ESCO and SME borrowers. The CEFP will \nprovide credit enhancement to the guarantees provided by Shaanxi SME Financing Guarantee \nCompany5 by making a cash deposit of not more than 20% of the guaranteed cofinancing loan \namount in the beneficiary bank of the guarantee. This will ensure that the guarantee facility will \nhave a minimum leveraging ratio of 5.6 For subprojects that require the purchase of energy \nefficient equipment, ADB loan proceeds can be provided as lease financing through a financial \nleasing company. \n \n13.  As energy efficiency investments have a short payback period, the subloans to be made \nusing the debt facility are expected to have a loan repayment period of 3\u20138 years. As the initial \nbatch of subloans is repaid, the proceeds will be relent to another batch of subprojects. For this \npurpose,  a  reflow  account  will  be  established  to  receive  the  repayments  of  the  entrusted \nsubloans as well as the reflows from cash collateral supporting the credit guarantees. It is \nexpected that the ADB loan proceeds will be reutilized at least twice before the loan is repaid.7 \n \n14.  ADB value addition. The project demonstrates a high degree of ADB value addition by \nstructuring an innovative financing vehicle for investments in energy efficiency and distributed \nrenewable energy in Shaanxi Province. This includes:  \n(i)  capacity building of domestic financial institutes by jointly undertaking technical \nand  environmental  as  well  as  financial  due  diligence  on  energy  efficiency \ninvestments by SMEs; \n(ii)  demonstrating how a credit guarantee facility can be structured using part of loan \nfunds as a cash collateral to support credit guarantees to mobilize additional \nfinancial resources from commercial banks; \n(iii)  encouraging commercial  banks to offer financing secured on energy efficiency \nequipment  financed  using  subloans  or  cash  flows  (for  those  projects \nimplemented by ESCOs) attributable to energy savings achieved. This would be a \n                                                 \n4  Entrusted loan is the provision of funds by a nonbanking commercial entity to a commercial bank to be onlent to \ndesignated borrowers. The commercial bank\u2019s role is limited to disbursing the loans to designated borrowers, \nkeeping custody of collateral, collecting loan repayments, and liquidating collateral in the event of default by a \nborrower. The credit risk remains with the provider of funds and not with the commercial bank. \n5  This company was selected by SPG based on their track record in providing credit guarantees to SMEs.  \n6  The ratio of the total amount of loans guaranteed by the guarantee fund to the special reserve fund. \n7  The duration of the ADB loan will be 15 years. \n ", "4 \ndeparture  from  the  current  practice  of  requiring  real  estate  collateral  or  corporate \nguarantees from the parent company. \n(iv)  provision of credit lines to ESCOs and financial leasing companies to finance a \nseries of energy-saving investments; \n(v)  setting up partnerships with reputed local engineering design and environmental \ninstitutes to bring in technical capacity to undertake technical due diligence; and \n(vi)  establishing and implementing an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) to build the capacity of commercial  banks and the project implementing \nagency, for ensuring that the subprojects comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) requirements. \n \n15.  Lessons from previous projects. The lessons learnt from previous ADB FIL projects \nfor  energy  efficiency  improvement  in  the  PRC  include  inadequate  credit  risk  transfer  to \ncommercial banks, selection of subborrowers by local government officials, absence of market \nbased pricing of subloans and excessive reliance on fixed assets collateral.8 In addition, there \nwere no credit enhancement and risk sharing mechanisms to encourage commercial banks to \nextend financing to SME and ESCO subborrowers. These lessons have been incorporated to \nthe project design through innovative features described in para. 12 and ADB value addition \ndescribed in para. 14. In addition, the credit risk and credit approval have been transferred from \nthe provincial governments to commercial organizations such as SFHG and commercial banks \nbased on the lessons learnt from the previous FIL projects in the PRC.  \n \n16.  The project directly contributes to the priorities of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n(2016\u20132020)  for  the  PRC\u2014i.e.,  supporting  the  \u201cecological  civilization\u201d  objective  of  the \ngovernment through environmentally sustainable growth, pollution control, resource recycling, \nclimate change mitigation, energy efficiency improvement, and increased use of renewable \nenergy. The project is also fully consistent with the 13th plan (footnote 2) of the national and \nprovincial  governments  to  achieve  energy  conservation,  emission  reduction,  and  industrial \ntransformation and to deepen access to finance for emerging industries and SMEs. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n17.  The impact will be that energy intensity and emissions in Shaanxi Province are reduced. \nThe outcome will be that financing barriers to clean energy investments in Shaanxi Province are \nreduced. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n18.  Output  1:  Clean  energy  financing  platform  for  financing  energy-saving  and \nemission-reduction investments in Shaanxi Province is established. As highlighted in para \n11, the proposed CEFP will offer three complementary financial products to meet the financing \nrequirements of eligible clean energy investments. \n                                                 \n8  ADB 2008.

Output  2:  Demonstrative  energy-saving  and  emission-reduction  subprojects \nfinanced  by  the  clean  energy  financing  platform  are  implemented.  The  first  batch  of \nsubprojects to be supported will include (i) industrial waste heat recovery and utilization for \nelectricity  generation  and  heat  supply,  (ii)  heat  supply  energy  efficiency  improvement,  (iii) \ndistributed solar photovoltaics, (iv) biogas and biofuel recovery for agriculture waste, (v) use of \nwaste gases from industrial processes for power generation, (vi) use of geothermal energy for \nheat  supply  for  residential  areas,  (vii)  retrofit  of  industrial  processes  with  highly  efficient \nequipment, and (viii) energy efficiency improvements in buildings and public facilities. Some of \nthese  subprojects  may  be  implemented  using  energy  management  or  build-own-operate \ncontracts. These subprojects will result in substantial energy (i.e. coal) savings and reduction in \ngreenhouse gas emissions. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n20.  The investment cost of the first batch of subprojects is estimated to be $459.0 million, \n(Table 1), which includes the financial charges on entrusted loans and an estimated amount of \ncommercial bank loans. Cofinancing of $167.6 million will be mobilized on a collaborative basis \nfrom commercial banks, including the two entities that are acting as entrusted banks, i.e., \nShanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPDB) and Chang\u2019an Bank. Reflows from the first batch \nwill be relent twice to finance two additional batches of subprojects of a similar nature with an \ninvestment requirement of about $500 million each. Hence, the total investment mobilized by \nthe CEFP is tentatively estimated to be in the range of $1.5 billion. \n \n21.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $150  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the proposed project. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 10 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \n \n22.  The  ADB  loan  proceeds  will  be  onlent  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  the  Shaanxi \nprovincial government (SPG) and by the Shaanxi Provincial Financial Department (on behalf of \nSPG) to Shaanxi Financial Holding Group (SFHG) on terms identical to those offered by ADB to \nthe Ministry of Finance.9 SFHG is the financial intermediary for this project. The credit risks and \nthe risks of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuation will be borne by the SFHG. SFHG \nwill also be responsible for the payment of commitment fees on any undisbursed part of the \nloan.  SFHG  will  use  ADB  loan  proceeds  to  support  selective  industrial  energy  efficiency \ninvestments in Shaanxi Province. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  SFHG, wholly owned by the SPG, is a holding group of nonbank financial institutions engaging in strategic \ninvestments, promotion of financing for SMEs, trading platforms for nonferrous metal, equity holdings as well as \nemissions, and private equity investments. \n ", "6 \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

The total amount of retroactive \nfinancing will not exceed 20% of the loan amount. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2015, as amended from time to time) and detailed arrangements agreed \nbetween  the  government  and  ADB  as  stipulated  in  the  Project  Administration \nManual and Loan Agreement. a \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SFHG = Shaanxi Financial Holding Group, SDIMC = SFHG Development & \nInvestment Management Company. \na  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n25.  The project will finance demonstrative energy saving and emission reduction projects in \nShaanxi  Province.  Detailed  subproject  selection  criteria,  covering  technical,  financial,  and \nenvironmental and social safeguards, were agreed with the implementing agency. SDIMC is \nrequired to prepare a subproject appraisal report to verify the subproject\u2019s compliance with the \nselection criteria and obtain ADB\u2019s \u201cno objection\u201d before approving the subprojects under the \nfirst batch. Detailed guidelines on the subproject screening and appraisal are provided in the \nPAM (footnote 11). Technical, financial, economic, and environmental due diligence was carried \nout on a representative set of subprojects. The remaining subprojects will be appraised and \napproved before loan effectiveness. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  Technical due diligence of a representative set of subprojects (i) verified the technical \nfeasibility of the proposed technologies to achieve the desired energy savings and emission \nreduction; (ii) verified the proposed cost estimates; (iii) assessed the availability of proposed \ntechnologies  in  the  PRC  market;  (iv)  verified  the  energy  saving  and  emission  reduction \n ", "8 \nestimates in the feasibility study reports; (v) defined the technical parameters to be monitored \nbefore and after implementation to verify the actual energy savings and emission reduction \nachieved; and (vi) identified main contract packages to be procured and procurement methods \nto be adopted to ensure competitive, transparent, and efficient procurement of goods and \nservices.11 \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n27.  Financial due diligence was carried out on SFHG and financial institutions that will \npartner with SFHG in implementing the project. (i. e. SPDB, Chang\u2019an Bank, and Shaanxi SME \nFinancing  Guarantee  Company).12 These  entities  are  financially  viable  and  are  capable  of \nmeeting financial obligations and debt service payments without difficulty. SFHG has a solid \nfinancial standing. As of December 2015, its net assets increased to CNY9.18 billion, the ratio of \ntotal  liabilities  to  assets  was  kept  below  50%,  and  the  current  ratio  is  always  above  2.0. \nMeanwhile,  the  group\u2019s  profitability  consistently  improved:  earnings  before  interest,  taxes, \ndepreciation, and amortization grew from CNY160.7 million in 2011 to CNY321.50 million in \n2015. SFHG\u2019s net profit margin was quite high (over 50%) during 2011\u20132015. The executing \nagency's financial standing is assessed to be sufficiently robust to absorb the related credit risks \nof subprojects as well as interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation risks. The integrity due \ndiligence of SFHG showed no negative findings. \n \n28.  The financial viability of the appraised subprojects was evaluated. These subprojects \nhave a total investment value of $157.8 million amounting to 34% of first batch of subprojects. \nThe subborrowers\u2019 debt service capability was ascertained for the representative subprojects \nand found to be within the prudential limits set by the subproject selection criteria. The financial \ninternal rate of return was calculated for the appraised subprojects to ensure that it exceeds the \nweighted average cost of capital for each subproject and ranges from 9.24% to 30.4%. The \neconomic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  of  the  appraised  subprojects  was  calculated  by \nestimating the economic benefits and costs, including the climate change and pollution control \nbenefits. The EIRR of each appraised subproject exceeds 9% and the subprojects\u2019 EIRR ranges \nfrom  11.3%  to  53.3%  and  the  consolidated  EIRR  of  identified  subprojects  is  24.3%.  The \neconomic benefits of carbon savings are valued at $35 per ton.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n29.  The financial management assessment (footnote 13) was conducted in July 2016 in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the Financial Management and Analysis of Projects and \nFinancial Due Diligence: A Methodology Note.13 The assessment considered the capacity of the \nSFHG, SDIMC, SPDB, Chang\u2019an Bank, and Shaanxi SME Financing Guarantee Company, \nincluding  funds  flow  arrangements,  staffing,  accounting  and  financial  reporting  systems, \nfinancial information systems, and internal and external auditing arrangements. The assessment \nresults  show  the  financial  management  systems  and  procedures  for  proper  financial \nmanagement  and  reporting  for  ADB  loan  implementation.  SPDB  and  Chang\u2019an  Bank  fully \ncomply with the prudential regulations of the regulator. An action plan to mitigate the financial \nmanagement risks is provided in the PAM. The overall risk was assessed to be medium \n                                                 \n11 The detailed technical description of appraised subprojects is in Technical Description of Identified Subprojects \n(accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n12 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n13 ADB. 2005.

Procurement will be done using commercial practices acceptable to ADB in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) applicable to FILs. \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with \nthe government and SFHG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 11). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n31.  The  project  is  likely  to  have  positive  social  impacts  by  reducing  the  air  pollution \nassociated with energy consumption and industrial production, and create global public goods \nby  contributing  to  the  reduction  of  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  In  addition,  the  project  is \nexpected to improve the efficiency and quality of heat supply to residential areas. The project is \nexpected to contribute to the development of distributed renewable energy and of value-adding \nservice industries such as the energy service industry, which will contribute to the creation of \nnew jobs in green economic activities for knowledge workers. However, the project will not have \ndirect poverty reduction impacts and opportunities for improving gender equity. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  Environment. The project is classified as financial intermediation loan. An ESMS is \nestablished to meet national laws and ADB\u2019s environmental and social safeguard requirements \nfor FIL as per the Safeguard Policy Statement.14 The ESMS provides guidance on (i) screening, \ncategorization, and review of subprojects; (ii) organizational structure and staffing, including \nskills  and  competencies  in  environmental  and  social  areas;  (iii)  capacity  building;  and  (iv) \nmonitoring and reporting. As per the ESMS requirements, the executing agency has entered \ninto  a  long-term  contract  with  an  experienced  environment  consultancy  firm.  The  ESMS \nprovides for environment category A subprojects to be included and, if any such subprojects are \nincluded, ADB will review the environmental impact assessments and approve them if they meet \nits Safeguard Policy Statement requirement, including disclosure and consultation. The existing \nindustrial facilities where subprojects are located will be subject to an environmental audit, and \nrecommendations will be made to ensure that these facilities meet the acceptable standards. \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \nfinancial intermediary. The subproject selection criteria exclude subprojects that (i) require new \nland acquisition, (ii) result in labor retrenchment or labor redundancies, or (iii) have adverse \nimpacts on ethnic minority communities. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 The integrated project benefits and impacts \nare expected to outweigh the costs. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n14 Financial Intermediary: Environmental and Social Management System Arrangement (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nApproved subprojects do not achieve the  The subprojects will be subjected to technical due diligence to \nexpected level of energy savings  ensure  that  the  technologies  selected  are  feasible  and  the \nestimated energy saving potential is accurate and reliable.
