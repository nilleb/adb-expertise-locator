Consulting services are an integral part of Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) operations. \nThe consulting industry in the developing member countries (DMCs), compared to that in the \ndeveloped countries1, is less developed and DMC consulting firms rarely win selection as lead \nconsultants in ADB-financed projects. The constraints on the DMCs industry\u2019s participation \nreflect  the  conditions  of  underdevelopment.  ADB\u2019s  policy  encourages  the  use  of  domestic \nconsultants2 in ADB financed loans and technical assistance (TA). In line with this policy ADB \nhas so far provided a number of TAs3 to assist several DMCs to promote the development of \ntheir  domestic  consulting  services.  These  TAs  have  helped  to  organize  and  strengthen \nconsulting associations in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines. They \nhave been well received by DMC governments and consultants, many of whom have asked \nADB to conduct more seminars. There is also strong support among ADB\u2019s operational divisions \nfor continued assistance to strengthen the consulting industry in DMCs. Due to the continuing \nneed for ADB to strengthen the domestic consulting industry in DMCs, ADB\u2019s reorganization \ncoordination  group  approved  this  regional  TA4  under  the  category  interregional  knowledge \nproducts and services. The TA framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Past  seminars  for  the  development  of  domestic  consultants  and  research  by  other \nmultilateral agencies have shown that the domestic consulting industry in DMCs suffer from \nseveral structural weaknesses. They are characterized by a small number of large firms and a \nlarge number of small and medium-sized firms. They generally have inadequate managerial \nskills that results in poor proposals and unrealistic cost estimates. Other common features \ndistinguishing DMC domestic consulting industry from that of the developed countries include (i) \nevolvement from public enterprises and a general lack of discipline and competition, (ii) lack of \nindependent and self-supporting professional societies to play supporting roles, (iii) inadequate \nincentives from the government for industry development. However, these features vary widely \namong individual DMCs: some are close to those in developed countries while others are at an \nearly stage of development. Based on these features, the consulting industry in DMCs may be \ncategorized into two groups: a more-developed group (MDG) and  a less-developed group \n(LDG). The industry in the MDG is more developed and organized but sometimes lack familiarity \nwith ADB\u2019s policies and procedures for recruiting consultants. The industry in the LDG, on the \nother hand, tends to comprise only a few individuals and firms and lack appropriate consulting \norganizations.  \n \n3.  During  the  early  stages  of  implementing  TA  5600,5  ADB  found  that  the  consulting \nindustry in the MDG DMCs was keen to learn more about ADB\u2019s consulting assignments, and \nprepared to pay for the cost of seminars. On the other hand, ADB found it difficult to find \nsuitable sponsors for seminars in LDG DMCs. To maximize the effectiveness of the TA, ADB\u2019s \nrecent efforts mostly targeted MDG countries. Since the expenses in these countries were \n                                                      \n1  The consulting industry in the developed countries have evolved over a period of about two centuries but those in \nthe DMCs have only existed for a few decades.  \n2  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers. Manila. (paragraph 4.01). \n3  Since 1983, ADB has provided seven regional TAs for the development of domestic consulting services, and has \nconducted a total of 48 seminars in 20 DMCs. Some DMCs with more developed consulting industry also benefit \nfrom the TAs for Seminars on Business Opportunities.  \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 2003 \n5  ADB. 1994. Technical Assistance for the Development of Domestic Consultant Services in Developing Member \nCountries. Manila. (This TA closed on 30 November 2003). ", "2      \nlimited to only staff costs and seminar materials, ADB was able to conduct more seminars than \noriginally planned.  \n \n4.  Since ADB adopted poverty reduction as its overarching goal in 1999, its development \nagenda has become increasingly complex. The long-term strategic framework that translates \nthis multidimensional goal into a plan includes several cross cutting issues involving social and \nenvironmental  sustainability  and  good  governance.  Most  ADB-financed  projects  must \nconcurrently address legal, social, economic, and environmental issues as well as engineering \nand communication with society. In the same manner, the demand for consultants in DMCs has \nalso increased and become more complex. The emphasis on inclusive social development, \ngender, and environmental issues has led to a need for in-depth knowledge of such issues. \nDomestic consultants have a comparative advantage in finding appropriate solutions in local \nconditions  and  in  addressing  a  broad  range  of  real  life  and  end-beneficiary  driven \ndevelopmental issues. The progress towards achieving these objectives will help achieve more \nand faster retention of knowledge as well as multiplier effects in the beneficiary countries. \n \n5.  In keeping with the complex agenda of development agencies and the requirements of \nDMCs,  the  consulting  industry,  being  an  agent  of  change  for  ensuring  development \neffectiveness, has undergone a number of changes. The industry is evolving from traditional \nsector-based specialists into suppliers of integrated services that include specialists from many \ndifferent disciplines. These changes are providing greater opportunities to develop the domestic \nconsulting industry in DMCs. Large consulting firms in developed countries are tending to \nbecome suppliers of complete services and serve as \u201cone-stop shops\u201d. Many DMC consulting \nfirms can specialize as sub-suppliers or niche specialists within large project delivery systems.  \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s introduction of the quality and cost based method of selecting consulting firms on \n1 April 2002 added a new dimension to consultant selection. The competition helped ADB to \nmanage its scarce financial resources efficiently, and facilitated the entry of DMC consultants \ninto  the  mainstream.  The  competition  is  also  encouraging  the  domestic  and  international \nconsulting firms to form partnerships, and international consultants are taking advantage of the \nlower fees charged by DMC consultants and are including more of them in their international \nteams. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  new  development  agenda  promotes  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \nhaving an important role in social development. Many NGOs in DMCs, like many domestic \nconsultants, are not necessarily prepared to compete successfully for consulting assignments in \nADB projects and this situation needs remedying. \n \n8.  Continued capacity building in the DMC consulting industry, including NGOs, is needed \nto  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  ADB\u2019s  development  agenda.  This  includes  examining \npossibilities of twinning arrangements between the consulting industry in developed countries \nand DMCs. The LDG DMCs particularly need greater assistance. Achieving viable domestic \nconsulting  industry  in  DMCs  will  also  stimulate  economic  development  and  diminish  the \ncountries\u2019 dependence on overseas expertise.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The TA will encourage and increase the participation of domestic consultants in ADB-\nfinanced TA and loans. The main output of the TA will be the enhanced capacity of domestic \n ", "      3\nconsultants in DMCs, as evidenced by (i) increased awareness among current and potential \ndomestic consultants of the consulting opportunities in ADB financed projects, (ii) increased \nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s requirements and the procedures for participating in ADB financed \nprojects, and (iii) enhanced capacity of domestic consultants to submit acceptable proposals to \nADB and its borrowers.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The DMCs will be classified into two groups: (i) the LDG will include Cambodia, the \nCentral Asian Republics, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Nepal, Pacific countries, \nand Viet Nam and (ii) the MDG will include Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Peoples\u2019 \nRepublic of China, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. The TA will provide for two types of \nseminars in selected DMCs: a basic seminar in the LDG countries and an advanced seminar \nthe MDG countries. Seminars will be tailored to the specific needs of each DMC group. The \ndomestic consulting industry and NGOs will be consulted before each seminar is designed. At \nleast six basic and six advanced seminars will be conducted each year during 2004 and 2005. \nIn the Pacific and Central Asian DMCs, because of their geographic proximity to each other and \nthe similarities of their consulting industry, the needs of two or three DMCs may be addressed \nthrough a single seminar.  \n \n11.  Basic seminar will cover (i) consulting practices and basic consulting skills; and (ii) \nADB\u2019s consulting procedures and business opportunities. The basic consulting processes and \nskills section will cover developing information, transferring knowledge to clients, establishing \nconsulting  firms,  pricing  and  contracting,  completing  projects  and  evaluating  projects.  An \ninternational consultant based in Manila will be recruited for about 3\u20134 weeks to develop generic \ncontent for the basic seminar. A domestic consultant will be engaged for about three weeks in \neach LDG country in which a basic seminar will be conducted. The domestic consultant will \nconsult current and prospective members of the domestic consulting industry and NGOs and \nprepare a report on the domestic consulting industry. The report will include a profile of the \nindustry and its constraints to participation in ADB assignments. This information will be used in \nrevising seminar materials and addressing specific local issues. The terms of reference for the \ninternational and domestic consultants are provided in Appendix 2. The participants in the \nseminars will be current and prospective consultants, academics, professionals, and NGOs. A \nminimum number of participants will be required for conducting a seminar and the number will \ndepend on the stage of development of the industry in the country. \n \n12.   Advanced seminars will target consultants in MDG DMCs who have limited experience \nin ADB assignments. The seminars will focus on ADB\u2019s policies and procedures and will include \nbusiness opportunities for domestic consultants. The seminars will cover the following modules: \nthe guidelines on the use of consultants by ADB and its borrowers, business opportunities, \nregistration of consultants, selection procedures, request for proposal, technical and financial \nproposals, proposal evaluation, and contract negotiations. The purpose of the seminars and the \ncriteria for participation will be advertised in the local media. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $180,000. The detailed cost estimates are shown in \nAppendix 3. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \n ", "4      \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency and the consulting services division will implement the \nTA.  The  resource  persons  for  the  seminars  will  be  consulting  services  division  staff  with \nadequate knowledge of the DMC consulting industry and ADB\u2019s consulting services procedures. \nThe division will be responsible for (i) scheduling basic and advanced seminars in LDG and \nMDG countries during 2004 and 2005, and (ii) recruiting an individual international consultant \nand a domestic individual consultant as appropriate in each DMC scheduled for a seminar. \nSeminars will be scheduled to cover as many DMCs as possible. The consultants will be \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  Asian \nDevelopment Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants.  \n \n15.  The resident/regional missions in the LDG countries will organize the basic seminars \nincluding  advertising,  renting  conference  rooms  and  audiovisual  equipment,  providing \nsecretarial assistance, making  logistical  arrangements,  and  issuing  invitations  to  interested \nparticipants. The ADB will finance the cost of the seminars. The participants will be responsible \nfor  their  own  travel  and  accommodation  costs.  Consulting  associations  representing  the \nconsulting industry in the MDG countries, in consultation with the governments, will sponsor and \nadvertise the advanced seminars. They will bear all the costs of the seminars other than the \ncosts of ADB staff and seminar materials. They may charge participants fees to cover their \ncosts. The participants will be responsible for their own travel and accommodation costs. \n \n16.  The seminars will be conducted in English but interpreters will be used when necessary \nto achieve TA objectives. The seminars will include 1.5 days of presentation and a half day of \nindividual  discussions.  Regional  seminars  and  consecutive  seminars  will  be  considered  in \nregions like the Pacific and the CARs, to ensure that the TA resources are used efficiently. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $180,000 on a grant basis for \nthe  Development  of  Domestic  Consultant  Services  in  Developing  Member  Countries,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1 5\n   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions/ Risks \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanism \n \nI.
