As Indonesia decentralizes its administrative system, improving the capacity of local \ngovernments  to  deliver  the  level  of  social  services  required  by  the  \u201cMinimum  Services \nStandards\u201d prescribed by the Central Government is an essential prerequisite to protect the \nwelfare  of  the  poor.  The  first  annual  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  Poverty  Reduction \nPartnership  Agreement  Review  completed  in  March  2002,  notes  \u201cEstablishment  and \nimplementation of service standards and developing mechanisms to ensure adequate funding of \nservices for the poor is needed to ensure regional equity and avoid exacerbating regional \ndisparity.\u201d Accordingly the Government of Indonesia requested the ADB to continue supporting \ndecentralization and the provision of technical assistance (TA) to help mainstream poverty \nreduction through development financing focusing on this issue.1  The Fact-Finding mission \nfielded in September 2002 reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, financing, and implementation arrangements of the TA. During the course of fact-finding \nthe Government requested the title of the TA to be changed from Mainstreaming Poverty \nReduction through Development Financing, to Local Government Provision of Minimum Basic \nServices for the Poor to better reflect its content. The TA is supported by the ADB/Department \nfor International Development of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Partnership for \nInnovations in Poverty Reduction, which aims at enhancing central and local governments\u2019 \ncapacity  for  poverty  reduction  and  pro-poor  provision  of  basic  services  in  planning, \nimplementation, monitoring, and evaluation. \n \nII.   ISSUES \n2.  With  decentralization,  broad  responsibilities  were  transferred  in  Indonesia  from  the \nCentral  Government  to  local  government.  These  included  the  responsibility  for  providing \nessential basic services in agriculture, education, environment, health, and infrastructure. These \nbroad areas of responsibility are being broken down into \u201cobligatory functions (OF)\u201d with levels \nof  responsibility  and  accountability  assigned.  To  ensure  that  the  poor  are  provided  with \nminimum basic services, the \u201cMinimum Services Standards (MSS)\u201d are being defined. The \n\"Minimum Service Standards\" are to be the minimum level of service necessary for the local \ngovernments  to  fulfill  their  OF  and  serve  as  monitoring  indicators  of  local  government \nperformance. The OF are enshrined in Law 22/1999 on Regional Government (Law 22) and \nspecifically mentioned in Law 25, 2000, on Authorities of the Government (Law 25). Law 25 also \ncalls for the preparation of MSS for the functions specified in Law 22.  \n \n3.  While local government is accountable for performing OF and the delivery of basic \nservices in accordance with the MSS, they require a detailed regulatory framework, guidelines, \nand  support.  Sector  ministries  already  issued  Obligatory  Functions  and  Minimum  Service \nStandards (OF&MSS) of uneven quality in most of the required sectors.2 To provide a coherent \nset  of  guidelines,  the  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs  (MOHA)  has  initiated  the  detailing  of  the \nlegislative and regulatory framework. This task includes determining clear criteria for OF, a clear \nconcept of MSS and clear process and criteria for determining them, and a policy on delineating \nfinancial responsibilities for central and local governments. \n  \n  \n                                                      \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in September 2002. \n2  These included agriculture, communications, cooperatives, education, environment, health, industry, labor, public \nworks, public administration, and trade. ", "2  \n4.  While detailing of the regulatory framework is under way, MOHA has issued instructions \nto all provincial, city, and district heads3 on their responsibilities during this transition period. The \ninstructions clarify that local governments are responsible for implementing their authorities \nrelated to OF&MSS and that they may use the detailed MSS issued by some line agencies in \nthe absence of further detailed instructions.   \n \n5.  MOHA has also initiated a model-building exercise in two provinces and four local \ngovernments to determine how best to establishing criteria for OF and for determining the MSS.  \nIt was also considered necessary to assess the effectiveness of the criteria for developing well \nphrased and appropriate OF&MSS based on actual experience in the field.  A number of aid \nagencies  are  supporting  the  Government  in  the  model-building  exercise  including  ADB, \nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  fuer  Technische  Zusammenarbeit,  the  United  States  Agency  for \nInternational Development, and the World Bank,4 in the areas of education, health, and public \nadministration.5 This exercise is intended to provide a model for testing and validating OF&MSS \nin the remaining sectors. \n \n6.  While  fulfilling  OF&MSS  is  the  responsibility  of  local  governments,  the  Central \nGovernment is responsible for ensuring that local governments are sufficiently well equipped to \ndo  so.    Yet  at  this  juncture,  no  groundwork  has  been  carried  out  to  monitor  how  local \ngovernments manage to provide minimum basic services following the assignment of MSS.  \nAny sense of how this will have an impact on their planning and budgeting process, institutional \norganizations, human resources, and monitoring and reporting systems is purely conjectural. Of \nparticular concern is the impact on resource-poor local governments that are far from achieving \nthe MSS.  It is assumed that in these local governments the poor are the majority of those not \nserved.  \n \n 7.  In  the  absence  of  such  understanding,  the  Central  Government  cannot  develop  a \nstrategy to support local governments in areas including the provision of budgetary support and \nenforcement. Greater understanding of the issue can be obtained only through action research \nin a sample of local governments. Little time remains for field validation, as local governments \nare  demanding  that  the  Central  Government  issues  implementing  guidelines.  The  Central \nGovernment has committed to completing the issuance of detailed regulations by the end of \n2003.  \n \n8.  Basic services need to be delivered in a most cost effective manner, given the resource \nconstraints; to be accessible by the poor; and to be satisfactory to the public. Translation of \nMSS into detailed implementation measures requires an understanding of alternative delivery \nmechanisms.6 Often the best alternatives are locally developed and are often ignored in the \nabsence of any dissemination mechanism. Currently there is no systematic compilation of such \ninformation or arrangements to disseminate. \n \n                                                      \n3  Circular 100/757/OTDA on Mandatory Authority and Minimum Service Standards, July 2002. \n4  ADB has taken the lead in the education sector with support from TA INO-3701 Support for Decentralized  \n   Education Management approved 8 August 2001 for $900,000.  \n5  Public administration here refers to general local government service delivery and citizen administration. \n6  An MSS regarding enrollment in junior secondary education could be met in various ways.  Education services \n   could be provided by government or the private sector in traditional schools or by correspondence.  These services \n   could be provided for profit, at cost, or with subsidy. Participation could be encouraged by building more schools to \n   bring the school closer or by reducing transportation costs through public transportation vouchers for children living \n   in outlying areas. The districts must decide the best way to achieve the MSS.  \n   ", "                                                                                                                                                              3\n9.  The aid community including ADB has actively supported the Central Government in \ndefining OF&MSS. There is an urgent need for developing a central government strategy to \nsupport local government in managing OF&MSS for essential services but the problems faced \nby local government in implementing OF&MSS can be fully understood only after seeing their \neffect on the entire planning and budgeting cycle. ADB will be providing substantial assistance \nin local government capacity building. The Sustainable Capacity Building for Decentralization \nProject, proposed for approval in late 2002, will assist local governments in capacity building \nbased on their own capacity building action plan.  The findings produced through the present TA \nwill provide essential inputs to capacity building needs assessment in planning, budgeting, \ninstitutions, and personnel.  The TA will similarly provide essential inputs to the proposed \nIntegrated Urban Infrastructure Development and Poverty Reduction Project in 2003. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.       Purpose and Output  \n10.  The overall goal of the TA is to enable local governments to carry out their responsibility \nto provide basic services to the poor. The specific purpose of the TA aims to clarify the impact of \nOF&MSS  on  district  government  planning  and  budgeting,  institutional  structure,  human \nresources, monitoring, and reporting through learning-by-doing and field validation. The TA will \nalso  test  a  mechanism  for  identifying,  testing,  and  disseminating  best  local  government \ninnovations  and  practices  in  the  implementation  of  OF&MSS.    Appendix  1  provides  a TA \nframework. \n \nB.        Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   The methodology will focus on action research to understand how OF&MSS impact on \nlocal government administration and how the respective experiences can be used for policy \nrefinement,  and  for  designing  support  initiatives  by  the  Central  Government,  including \nappropriate means of replication. The key activities include the following:  \n(i)   Provide direct support to local governments in incorporating OF&MSS through a \nfull year of the planning and budgeting cycle. Such support will include screening \nthe OF&MSS to ensure they are phrased properly and address only national \ngoals,  developing  and  costing  alternative  service  delivery  mechanisms, \nprioritizing  and  sequencing  implementation,  and  incorporating  implementation \ninto planning and budgeting. \n(ii)   Estimate  the  per  capita  cost  of  financing  OF&MSS  including  the  cost  of \nalternative  delivery  mechanisms  to  support  implementation  of  OF&MSS  for \nbenchmarking and calculation of specific grants.  \n(iii)  Based on experiences gained from interaction with local governments, develop \nand  test  guidelines  incorporating  OF&MSS  in  planning  and  budgeting,  in \norganizational  and  human  resources  development,  and  in  monitoring  and \nevaluation for local government in consortium with the provincial and district level \nlocal governments responsible for their implementation. The TA will also identify \nmechanisms for incorporating ADB safeguard policies such as resettlement and \nindigenous people into MSS financing and implementation. \n(iv)   Develop and test a system for identifying and disseminating best innovations and \npractices to support local governments\u2019 delivery of basic services through action \n   ", "4  \nresearch.  Initiatives  to  be  reviewed  will  include  those  funded  though  the \nPartnership for Innovations in Poverty Reduction, as well as from other external \nagencies, and those funded by the Central and local governments. \n12.  Lessons from these activities will be synthesized, and recommendations discussed and \ndisseminated to the Central Government as essential inputs into a program of support and to \ndetermine allocation of scarce funds to redress regional disparities. More specifically, these \ninputs will support  \n(i)   refining and completing policies on OF&MSS including those dealing with fiscal \nbalance,  clarification  of  functions,  supervision  and  enforcement  mechanisms, \nplanning, and human resource development for the civil service; and  \n(ii)   appropriate capacity-building initiatives. The mechanisms developed to identify \nand disseminate innovations and best practices will provide a tool to support \nmore efficient and responsive delivery of basic services to the poor. \n \nC.       Cost and Financing  \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $937,500 equivalent, comprising $358,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $579,500 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$750,000 equivalent on a grant basis to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $392,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. ADB\u2019s contribution to the TA will be financed entirely by \nthe  Government  of  the  United  Kingdom.  The  Government  of  Indonesia  will  finance  the \nremaining  $187,500  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  costs  through  the  provision  of  office \naccommodation, transport, and remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff.  The details of \nTA costs and financing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.       Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Directorate of Policy Facilitation and Reporting of Regional Autonomy of MOHA will \nbe the Executing Agency for the TA. A technical team will be established which will include \nMOHA, the Ministry of Finance, the National Development Planning Agency, the State Ministry \nfor  State  Administrative  Reforms,  related  sector  ministries,  and  the  Association  of  Local \nGovernments, to oversee the implementation of the MOHA model building exercise.  \n \n15.  The TA will provide direct advisory support to selected local governments\u2019 incorporation \nof  OF&MSS  into  their  planning  and  budgeting,  institutional  structure,  human  resources, \nmonitoring and reporting, through the planning cycle for FY2004. In each of four provinces, one \ndistrict, one city, and the provincial level government will participate.  The consultants will also \nclarify the role and capacity-building needs of the provincial government in monitoring and \nsupporting the implementation of OF&MSS. \n \n16.  The consultants will focus on the OF&MSS for which the model-building exercise has \nbeen completed, as many sector OF&MSS remain of highly uneven quality. These are the \nhealth,  education,  and  public  administration  sectors.  However,  a  review  of  the  OF&MSS \nvalidated under the model-building exercise will still be required to assess the quality of the \nOF&MSS  with  local  government.  Quality  criteria  include  accessibility  by  the  poor.  The \nconsultants will work with the Technical Team to agree on a procedure for handling poorly or \nwrongly defined OF&MSS under the TA and for reporting problems encountered in the sector \nagencies. The consultants will also compare the priorities and constraints identified by poor \ncommunities  in  the  education  and  health  sectors  in  other  ADB  operations  including  the \nproposed  ADB  TA  for  Integration  of  Poverty  Considerations  into  Decentralized  Education \n   ", "                                                                                                                                                              5\nManagement, against national priorities for feedback to the sector ministries as well as inputs to \nimplementation design.  \n \n17.   Selection of representative local governments for study will include consideration of \nparticipation  in  (i)  public  expenditure  reviews  carried  out  by  ADB,  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, and the World Bank; (ii) the second batch of districts in the proposed \nSustainable  Capacity  Building  for  Decentralization  Project;  and  (iii)  the  MOHA  modeling \nexercise. Also to be considered is local government commitment to participate in the process.  \nThis may be expressed in terms of their willingness to fund the cost associated with participation \nin TA workshops. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, with activities expected to commence in \nMarch  2003  and  to  be  completed  in  September  2004.  MOHA  and  participating  local \ngovernments will provide counterpart staff, office accommodation, miscellaneous administration \nand support services, and local transport.  \n \n19.  The TA will be monitored and reviewed by ADB missions, regular communications with \nMOHA,  and  the  inception  and  completion  reports  of  the  consultants.  The  inception  and \ncompletion reports will be submitted to ADB and MOHA within 1 month after commencement \nand completion of the activity, respectively. A summary of each report will also be provided in \nBahasa Indonesia.  MOHA will prepare quarterly progress reports for submission to ADB. It will \nalso submit a completion report to ADB within 3 months of the TA completion. \n \n20.  Limited equipment will be required to support implementation of the TA activities. Data \nprocessing  and  communication  equipment  may  be  procured  such  as  computers  and \nperipherals.  Equipment  will  be  purchased  by  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement and transferred to the EA upon completion of the TA. \n \n21.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB,  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal \nprocedure, through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and  \nquality and cost based selection method. Two international and six domestic consultants will \nprovide a total of 76 person-months of consulting services (16 person-months of international \nand 60 of domestic consulting). International consulting services will be required in the areas of \nlocal governance and decentralization policy. Domestic expertise will be required for public \nplanning  and  budgeting,  institutional  development,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation.    The \ninternational consultants will be responsible for engaging a non-government organization or \nresearch institute to document best innovations and practices in accordance with competitive \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  and  subject  to  prior  approval  by  ADB.    The  international \nconsultants will finalize the draft TOR for the best innovations and practices study which they \nwill submit to ADB for prior review and approval. Draft terms of reference are included in \nAppendix 3. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.
