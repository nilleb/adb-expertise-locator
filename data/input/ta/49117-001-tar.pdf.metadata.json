INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  In December 2014, the Philippine Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) asked \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) to support the national rollout \nof the JobStart Philippines (JSP) pilot project, which aims to assist out-of-school youth find \nemployment. In response, ADB carried out a fact-finding mission in August 2015. During that \nmission, ADB and DOLE agreed on the proposed impact, outcome and outputs, implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The DOLE\u2019s planned \nrollout of JSP to 64 local government units (LGUs) by 2020 builds on DOLE\u2019s experience and \nlessons  in  piloting  JSP  in  four  (4)  LGUs  from  January  2014  to  August  2015,  which  was \nsupported by a large scale ADB TA financed by the Government of Canada.1 The proposed TA \nwill support the government (through DOLE) through assistance with setting up the national \ninstitutional structure of JSP and capacity development for staff at DOLE and at 24 Public \nEmployment Service Offices (PESOs) located within the LGUs, as well as commencement of \nJSP activities in those 24 PESOs.2  \n2.  The TA supports the public sector management pillar of the country partnership strategy, \n2011\u20132016 and the employment generation pillar of the draft country operations business plan, \n2016\u20132018. It is designed as part of a programmatic approach to help address part of the youth \nemployment problem. The programmatic approach includes the Increasing Competitiveness for \nInclusive  Growth  Program  loan,3 2011  to  2014,  which  included  measures  to  promote  a \ncompetitive labor market, supported by large scale TA to implement the JSP pilot project aimed \nat  testing  strategies  to  help  young  people  find  decent  employment  (footnote  1).  These \ninterventions were followed by the TA requested by DOLE to set up the institutional structure for \nthe JSP rollout, to be followed by a sector development program loan called Facilitating Youth \nSchool-to-Work Transition, which is planned for delivery in 2016. This will include a project loan \nfor  JSP  rollout.  Previous  consultations  on  plans  for  a  national  rollout  were  held  on  an \nintermittent basis from November 2014 to July 2015, and these consultations benefited from \nprevious  TA  implementation  review  missions  under  the  JSP  pilot  project.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The Philippines has a youth employment problem. This is reflected in a slow school-to-\nwork transition for many young Filipinos (between the ages of 18 and 24). Frequent spells \noutside the labor market without training and for extensive periods of time damage young \npeople\u2019s  future  career  prospects  and  earnings.  This  situation  can  also  perpetuate  lifetime \npoverty for the young residing in poor households. Results from the 2008 ADB survey of 500 \nhouseholds in Metro Manila and Cebu found that high school graduates have a difficult time \nproductively integrating into the labor market, with only 20% finding a job within the first year of \nleaving school.4 On average, it takes high school graduates up to 4 years to find a paid job, and \nfewer than half actually find paid employment. In contrast to high school graduates, college \ngraduates on average find a job within 2 years and approximately 70% of them find paid \nemployment. As a result of this slow transition from school to work, one in four young persons \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nfor Subprogram 2 to the Republic of the Philippines for the Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth \nProgram. Manila. \n4  ADB. Forthcoming. Youth Situation in the Labor Market. Manila. \n ", "2   \n(between the ages of 15 and 24) are not in employment, education or training at any point in \ntime. This is the second highest rate in Southeast Asia, behind Indonesia. Young women are \nmore likely to withdraw from the labor market. For example, one in three young women is \nunlikely to be in employment, education or training. Of particular concern is the fact that young \npeople from low-income families are more than twice as likely to not be in employment, post-\nsecondary education of training compared to their peers in higher-income families. A large pool \nof young people from lower-income families is not being integrated into the labor market.  \n \n4.  Based on ADB\u2019s diagnostics of the youth situation in the labor market (footnote 4), the \nmain constraints to achieving a faster school-to-work transition for many young people involve \nboth the labor demand side and the labor supply side. On the labor demand side, while paid \nemployment has been expanding on average by 3.7% per annum (or almost 500,000 new jobs \nannually) since 2010, it has not been sufficient to create jobs for the 800,000 new job seekers \neach year. The government has put in place reforms to lift growth and employment creation \nthrough infrastructure investments with a target to reach over 5.0% of gross domestic product \nby 2016, as well as continued financial sector and business climate reforms. On the supply side, \nthe main constraints to achieving a faster school-to-work transition as well as a faster job-to-job \ntransition for the unemployed include (i) weak linkages between the education and training \nsectors  and  the  skills  requirements  of  industry,  meaning  that  many  young  people  are  ill \nprepared for the workplace, (ii) inadequate active labor market programs that can provide out-\nof-school youth with an integrated set of employment support services that help them find \ndecent employment, (iii) inadequate labor market information to assist young people with job \nsearches,  and  (iv)  under-resourced  PESOs  at  the  LGUs  to  provide  efficient  and  effective \nemployment facilitation services for out-of-school youth. \n \n5.  To  address  these  constraints,  DOLE\u2019s  employment  agenda  includes  several \ninterventions. A key one is the start of the national rollout of the JSP pilot project to be phased in \nfrom 2015 to 2020. The objective of this TA is to support DOLE\u2019s rollout of JSP nationally. The \nJSP is a remedial program implemented through the PESOs to provide \u201cat-risk\u201d out-of-school \nyouth with assistance to become job-ready.5 As a remedial program, JSP provides a young \nperson (the JobStarter) with services covering career guidance and coaching, life skills training \nfor 10 days,  access to short-term technical training for up to 3 months and placements with \nemployers for up to 3 months. 6 Employers develop a training plan and sign a memorandum of \nagreement with DOLE to take on JobStarters under the program. The training plan includes \nboth the short-term technical skills and the on-the-job training component. JSP provides grants \nto the employer to cover training costs and administration and provides the JobStarter with a \ntrainee allowance during training, while employers pay the youth a stipend during the internship \nperiod  of  least  75%  of  the  minimum  wage.  DOLE\u2019s  rollout  strategy  includes  measures  to \npromote the long-term sustainability of JSP. These include (i) 2015 DOLE department order \nconverting the pilot into a DOLE program, (ii) 2015 supplementary budget allocation of P29 \nmillion and proposed P100 million in 2016, and (iii) filing of the JSP bill to Congress in May \n2015, which, when enacted, will guarantee national government budget allocations annually.  \n \n                                                \n5  \u201cAt-risk\u201d youth in the JSP program refers to out-of-school youth at risk of not integrating into the labor market. The \ncriterion for \u2018at-risk\u2019 is youth aged between 18 to 24 with at least high-school education and less than 12 months of \nwork experience. \n6  Life skills for employability refer to those soft skills necessary for young people to be successful in obtaining and \nretaining a job. These include skills in searching for a job, resume writing, performing in interviews, communication \nwith  supervisors, peers, clients and  family,  work  and  emotional  attitudes  expected in  the  workplace,  team \ncollaboration, healthy habits, and financial literacy, among other important life skills.  \n ", "  3 \n6.  ADB has a long and close engagement with DOLE on youth employment and the JSP. \nUnder  ADB  programmatic  support  (the  Increasing  Competitiveness  for  Inclusive  Growth \nprogram and capacity development TA [footnote 1]), the JSP was successfully piloted in four \nLGUs  in  2014  and  2015:  Quezon  City,  Taguig  City,  City  of  San  Fernando  in  Pampanga \nprovince, and the municipality of General Trias, Cavite province. Over 5,000 out-of-school \nyouths registered for the program, of which two-thirds (about 3,200) were randomly selected to \nundertake career guidance and coaching and labor market information. Half of them were then \nrandomly selected to undertake the full cycle of services, from life skills and technical training to \ninternships with employers. The random selection of young people at different stages of the \nprogram was necessary to establish a randomized evaluation of the impact of the program on \nemployment for this at-risk demographic group. The 5,000-plus young people who registered for \nthe program will be traced for 6 months after the program finishes and the evaluation report will \nbe finalized in early 2016. Result of the evaluation will be used as inputs to refinements to JSP \nas it is rolled out. \n \n7.  The midterm evaluation of the pilot carried out in December 2014 provided two lessons \nfor  the  nationwide  JSP  rollout.  First,  the  evaluation  found  JSP  had  a  positive  impact  on \nemployment outcomes for the target group. Employers were very satisfied with the JSP as it \nhelped to address their skill shortages and interns were well prepared through life skills training. \nEmployers also liked the flexibility provided to them in developing training plans. The majority of \nthe  employers  said  they  would  retain  most  of  the  interns  as  regular  workers.  Employers \nparticipating in the program covered a diverse set of industries and occupations with varying \nskills competency requirements, such as in manufacturing, health care, food chains, and other \nservices. The beneficiaries also had a positive view of the program and found the life skills \ntraining course boosted their confidence in applying for jobs. The internships provided them with \na channel to acquire work experience and improve their chances of finding employment in the \nfuture. Second, design changes to JSP have been made to further facilitate the transition into \ndecent jobs. These include merging career guidance into life skills and reducing the internship \nfrom 6 months to 3 months.  \n \n8.  Based on the results of the pilot, and the two lessons, DOLE has, with ADB assistance, \ndeveloped a nationwide rollout plan for 2015 to 2020 and aims to implement JSP in 64 LGUs by \n2020, targeting more than 64,000 out-of-school youths into the program, of which 24 LGUs and \n15,000  JSP  beneficiaries  will  be  supported  by  the  proposed  TA.  DOLE  has  signed  14 \nmemorandums of understanding with partner LGUs to start the rollout in 2015. These LGUs \ncover the four pilots and the additional 10 LGUs (Mandaluyong City, Pasay City, and Caloocan \nCity in the National Capital Region; Cebu City, Davao City, and Tagum City in Davao del Norte; \nDumaguete in Visayas, the entire province of Bohol; Puerto Princesa City in Palawan, and \nCagayan de Oro in Mindanao). Every year, 10 additional LGUs will be covered by the program \nfrom 2016 to 2020. Funding of the rollout from 2015 to 2020 will come through government \nbudget allocations, Canadian government-proposed grant funding and an ADB-proposed project \nloan (24 LGUs) under ADB\u2019s Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition program, 2015\u20132020.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The impact will be increased youth employment rates. The outcome will be JSP rollout \nby  DOLE  and  PESOs  commenced.  This  will  be  measured  by  24  LGUs  having  signed \nmemorandums of agreement with DOLE and fully implementing JSP by December of 2021, with \nmore than 15,000 out-of-school youths accessing JSP in the 24 LGUs from 2015 to 2020.  \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will produce three main outputs: \n \n11.  Output 1: Capacity development of JSP units at DOLE headquarters and regional \nDOLE offices strengthened. This output will provide capacity development to staff from the \nBureau of Local Employment, DOLE, and will provide advisory services to the bureau on JSP \npolicy related to the implementation of the standard operating procedures, business processes \nand  templates,  development  of  the  monitoring  and  evaluation  framework,  and  grants \nmechanism using country systems. Capacity development will be provided to staff of selected \nregional offices for overseeing implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the JSP at the \nLGUs.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Life skills for employability training curriculum rolled out nationally. This \noutput will engage a professional life skills training provider (company) to implement the life \nskills (including soft skills) component of JSP by training the trainers at the PESOs and selected \ntraining institutions, and pairing with PESO staff (as on-the-job training) to provide life skills \ntraining to at least 15,000 JSP beneficiaries in 24 LGUs. The life skills provider will train 7,500 \nJobStarters  in  life  skills  while  the  PESOs  will  be  responsible  for  training  the  other  7,500 \nJobStarters funded under the TA. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Capacity  of  24  public  employment  service  offices  (PESOs)  in  JSP \nimplementation developed. Under this output, a capacity development plan will be developed \nwith each PESO, and training will be provided to staff covering all components of JSP, including \ncareer guidance and coaching, life skills, managing the Skills Registry System (database), and \nemployer outreach activities, in preparation for the first wave of JobStarter intakes. Each PESO \nwill  be  provided  with  a  Project  Coordinator for  12 months to  build capacity for  sustaining \nimplementation of JSP.  \n \n14.  Successful achievement of the TA outputs faces possible risks. First, there are local \npolitical  and  financial  risks.  PESO  participation  in  the  JSP  is  voluntary  so  a  change  of \nadministration in LGUs following elections may result in a lack of commitment to JSP. A second \nrisk to a successful JSP rollout is the government not securing sufficient national budgetary \nfunding for the PESOs\u2019 capacity development and for funding the grants component of JSP. \nThird, LGUs may provide insufficient budget and staff resources for JSP implementation. DOLE \nis addressing some of these issues through legislative changes to the PESO Act and in May \n2015 submitted to Congress the JSP Bill to secure government budget appropriations and \nprogram sustainability. The Department of Budget and Management has also allocated budget \nfunding in 2015 and proposed funding for 2016.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000, of which $1,300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, utilities, and other in-\nkind contributions. In addition, the Government of Canada is also considering cofinancing the \nTA at a later stage.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The DOLE will be the executing agency for the TA. The LGU signatories to the JSP \nmemorandums of understanding are the implementing agencies. Their functions will be guided \n ", "  5 \nby the program\u2019s standard operating procedures. A JSP steering committee, chaired by the \nsecretary  of  DOLE,  will  be  established  to  oversee  implementation  of  the  JSP  rollout. \nComposition of the steering committee will include officials from the Department of Finance, the \nDepartment of Budget and Management, the Department of Education, the National Economic \nand  Development  Authority,  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority, \nemployer organizations, and the National Youth Commission, among others. ADB and the \nGovernment of Canada will also be members of the steering committee. A project management \nunit will be established in DOLE\u2019s Bureau of Local Employment.  \n \n17.  A company will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time) to carry out activities under the TA. The single source \nselection method will be used to select Scope Global Pty Ltd,7 as it implemented the JSP pilot \nproject under the employment facilitation TA (footnote 1). The single source selection method \nwill be used to ensure continuity of technical advice and capacity development to DOLE and the \nPESOs in transiting from the pilot project to the nationwide rollout stage. This continuity is \ndeemed necessary to protect the integrity of JSP program and ensure effective and efficient \nimplementation  of  the  rollout.  The  consulting  services  under  the  TA  will  comprise  two \ninternational specialists: the team leader with employment program experience (15 person-\nmonths) and the international finance officer (15 person-months). Scope Global will engage 19 \nnational specialists: (i) two finance experts to assist DOLE with financial management and \ngovernment budgeted grant disbursements (10 person-months each), (ii) one information and \ncommunications technology expert (10 person-months), (iii) 14 Project Coordinators (15 person-\nmonths each), (iv) one communications and media relations expert (10 person-months), and  \n(v) one administrative officer (15 person-months). The firm will subcontract a life skills training \nprovider to implement the training program. Selection will be on a competitive basis with a fixed \namount contract. The TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The purchase of equipment will be done in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEquipment will be turned over to the executing and implementing agencies upon completion of \nTA activities. \n \n18.  Dissemination of outputs will be through a JSP website and Facebook page set up \nthrough the TA, but management will be handled by DOLE\u2019s JSP unit and communications \ndepartment. The website and Facebook page will be maintained by DOLE at the end of the \nprogram.  \n \n19.  Following the signing of the TA agreement between the government and ADB, the TA \nwill be implemented over 62 months from 1 November 2015 to 31 December 2020. Consultant \ndeliverables are included in the terms of references in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Philippines for Support for the Nationwide Rollout of JobStart Philippines,  \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n7  Scope Global Pty Ltd formerly named as Austraining Pty Ltd as contracted under TA 8335-PHI: Employment \nFacilitation for Inclusive Growth. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpacts the Project is Aligned with \nThe  Nationwide  Rollout  of  JSP  is  based  on  the  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2011\u20132016  and  will \ncontribute to the government\u2019s efforts to increase youth employment rates.a In particular, the project will \nsupport the government\u2019s efforts to establish the nationwide institutional setup for the JSP rollout between \n2015 and 2020. \n \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nProject Results Chain  Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome  By December 2021:     \nJSP rollout by DOLE  a. 24 LGUs signed  a.
