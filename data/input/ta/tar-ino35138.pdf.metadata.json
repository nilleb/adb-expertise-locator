The Government of Indonesia (the Government) has expressed its concern over the \nincreasing level of vehicular emissions and the consequent environmental impact in Jakarta and \nother large urban centers. To address this situation, the program to phase out leaded gasoline \ncommenced in July 2001 and the fuel prices are now linked to international prices to promote \nefficient  use.  Against  this  background  and  at  the  request  of  the  Government,  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  fielded  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  (the  Mission)  for  the  technical \nassistance (TA) for preparing the Clean Vehicle Fuel for Blue Skies Project (the Project) on 14\u2013\n16  May  2002. The  Mission  and  the  Government reached an understanding on the goals, \npurpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the TA. A preliminary logical framework is in Appendix 1, and a summary initial \npoverty and social assessment in Appendix 2.1 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Rapid urbanization and industrialization in Indonesia have created severe air pollution \nproblems, particularly in its major cities. The United Nations Environmental Program ranks \nJakarta as the world\u2019s third most polluted mega-city, after Mexico and Bangkok. Vehicular traffic \nemissions  are  obvious  and  major  sources  of  air  pollution.  An  ADB-funded  regional  TA2 \nestimated that vehicle emissions in Jakarta amount to approximately 71% of the oxides of \nnitrogen (NOx), 15% of sulfur dioxide (SO ), and 70% of particulate matter (PM )3 in the total \n2 10\nemission loads, and the annual economic cost of the associated health problems will be about \n$450 million by 2015. Another World Bank study4 estimated health damage due to all sources of \nair pollution in Jakarta at approximately $300 million per year in 1990, and this was projected to \nincrease tenfold by 2010 unless serious control efforts were implemented.  \n \n3.  In recognition of the growing severity of air pollution caused by industrial expansion, \nrapid urbanization, and increasing vehicle numbers, the World Bank started the Urban Air \nQuality Management Strategy (URBAIR) in 1992 as part of its Metropolitan Environmental \nImprovement Program, and an action plan was formulated. Following from this work, the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) and Indonesia\u2019s Environmental Impact Management \nAgency (BAPEDAL) (i) continued air pollution studies in the Greater Jakarta area from 1994 to \n1997, and prepared an air pollution control strategy for the period till 2010; and (ii) conducted an \ninvestigation and analysis of Jakarta\u2019s socioeconomy, environment, meteorology, air quality, \nand air pollution sources, which enabled formulation of an action plan through to 2000.  \n \n4.  Several critical components of the World Bank and JICA-supported action plans have \nbeen  implemented.  These  include  starting  to  phase  out  leaded  gasoline  in  July  2001, \nestablishing a networking system and stations for ambient air quality in 10 Indonesian cities, \nand developing emissions standards for stationary and mobile sources. However, a number of \nimportant air pollution countermeasures proposed in the earlier studies have not yet been \nimplemented effectively. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 June 2002 under the title Cleaner Energy Use for Blue \nSkies Project.  \n2  ADB. 2000.

Report No 12083-IND: Indonesia Environment and Development: Challenges for the Future. \nWashington. \n ", "2  \n5.  The ADB regional TA (footnote 2) further funded a multisectoral group, Friends of Clean \nEmission (the MEB) to formulate a draft action plan for reducing vehicular emissions. The MEB \nis  a  voluntary  group  that  comprises  officials  and  representatives  from  the  Government \nministries, city government, transport departments, police, fuel suppliers, transport industry, and \ncivil society. The Ministry of Environment (MOE) coordinated the MEB\u2019s activities and will need \nfurther technical and financial assistance to review and adopt, along with other concerned \nagencies,  the  action  plan;  formulate  policies;  and  establish  standards  and  guidelines  for \nvehicular emissions.   \n \n6.  The MEB action plan identified five areas for direct interventions to reduce vehicle \nemissions in Greater Jakarta, (i) implementation of new vehicle emission and fuel standards, (ii) \nimprovement of vehicle standard and technology (including installation of catalytic converters), \n(iii)  introduction  of  a  regime  for  inspection  and  maintenance,  (iv)  refinement  of  transport \nplanning, and (v) management of air quality. The maximum reduction of vehicle emission loads \nin 2005 and 2015 will be possible by implementing new vehicle emission and fuel standards by \nassuring supply of cleaner fuels and lowering vehicular emission limits. The Government has \npromoted compressed natural gas (CNG) as a clean fuel since 1995 and increasing its use will \nsignificantly reduce emission load and thereby help improve the air quality in Jakarta. \n \n7.  Several  countries  have  introduced  natural-gas-driven  vehicles  to  address  urban \npollution. These include Australia, Canada, Iran, New Zealand, Thailand, United Kingdom, and \nUnited States. More recently, CNG programs have been initiated in Argentina, Bangladesh, \nIndia, and Pakistan. ADB has approved two loans to develop the use of CNG for the transport in \nDhaka.5 \n \n8.  Natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel and an improvement over other primary \nenergy sources. Natural gas combustion results in virtually no atmospheric emissions of sulfur \ndioxide (SO ) or particulate matter (PM ); and 45-70% lower emissions of carbon monoxide \n2 10\n(CO), reactive hydrocarbon, oxides of nitrogen (NO ) and carbon dioxide (CO ) than from the \nx 2\ncombustion of other fossil fuels. Use of CNG would contribute significantly toward improved air \nquality. Advanced technology used for natural-gas-fueled vehicles could further reduce carbon \nmonoxide (CO) emissions by as much as 90% and reactive hydrocarbon emissions by about \n85%, compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles. \n \n9.  Indonesia is well endowed with natural gas reserves. During the past few years, about \n60% of natural gas production was exported as liquefied natural gas. However, given the scale \nof its gas reserves, Indonesia\u2019s present domestic natural gas consumption accounts for about \n18% of total primary commercial energy supply only, which is among the lowest in Southeast \nAsia.  Domestic  use  of  gas  and  associated  infrastructure  are  underdeveloped  and  the \nenvironmental benefits remain unrealized. ADB is supporting gas infrastructure development in \nSouth Sumatra under the Gas Transmission and Distribution Project,6 which has successfully \ncompleted the first major gas transmission pipeline (about 510 kilometer) in Sumatra. Additional \ngas transmission pipelines are being constructed under the same project to supply natural gas \nfrom South Sumatra to Singapore. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2002.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of Indonesia for the Gas Transmission and Distribution. Manila.  ", "3 \n10.  In 1995, the Government embarked on a reform process to increase development of \nnatural gas resources and mobilize the required financing from the private sector for natural gas \nproduction,  processing,  and  transmission.  In  1995,  ADB  provided  a  TA7  to  support  the \ndevelopment of a corresponding gas sector policy and a regulatory framework, and its inputs \nwere used in the new oil and gas law enacted by the Government in 2001. Another ADB-funded \nadvisory TA is being implemented to prepare a comprehensive gas sector development plan \nthat will guide and promote the development of Indonesia\u2019s gas infrastructure over the next 5 \nyears so as to meet the expected increased domestic demand for natural gas; reduce the \nconsumption  of  imported  and  exportable  substitute  fuels,  and  the  environmental  impacts \nassociated with the use of such fuels; and promote increased small-scale production and use of \nnatural gas including coal-bed methane.8 \n \n11.  A strategic plan to promote the use of clean vehicle fuel involves, among other things, a \ncritical  examination  of  two  aspects:  (i)  the  economic  least-cost  justification  for  a  project \nconsidering the objective and the nature of investment; and (ii) the rationale for a project to be \nimplemented through the public sector, and later strategies for private sector participation to \nexpand the cleaner fuel use. The public sector will need to start addressing the issue of \nvehicular emissions and establish a critical mass of clean fuel using vehicles and the required \nclean fuel supply. Since individuals and private sector fleet operators generally own vehicles, \nthe success of fuel switching will greatly depend on the motivation and the decision taken by the \nprivate sector. The Oil and Gas Law 22/2001 allows the private sector to obtain a license for \ntrading natural gas and provides open access to the natural gas transportation network. Thus, \nwith a suitable incentive structure, the private sector will eventually be fully involved in the \nsupply of clean energy for vehicles.   \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The TA will assist the Government to prepare the Project for Jakarta. The Project will    \n(i) promote the use of cleaner fuel to reduce the pollution caused by vehicular emissions and \nthereby  help  improve  urban  air  quality,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the  air  emission  testing  and \nmonitoring framework. The TA consultant will develop a strategic plan on the use of CNG to \nimprove urban air pollution, and a pioneer investment plan, which will provide the initial stock of \ncleaner vehicles and the required clean fuel supply to create a critical mass, so that further \nprivate sector investments can be promoted for lowering vehicular emissions. New investments \nunder the Project will be in (i) natural gas transmission pipelines,9 (ii) natural gas distribution \nnetwork and connections to new CNG filling stations, (iii) CNG filling and storage stations, (iv) \nconverter  kits  for  existing  gasoline  cars,  (v)  new  CNG-based  buses,  and  (vi)  stations  for \nmonitoring ambient air quality and vehicular emissions. The economic and financial analysis of \nthe  Project  will  also  help  determine  a  suitable  CNG  price.  The  TA  will  also  assist  the \nGovernment in developing a formal policy on the improvement of ambient air quality by reducing \nvehicle emissions. The policy can then be adopted by the Government and the Jakarta city \ngovernment.  \n \n                                                 \n7  Included in the 1995 project (footnote 6), as a TA for the study to establish gas regulatory framework. \n8  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Preparing a Gas Sector Development Plan. \nManila. \n9  The investment in natural gas transmission pipelines will be limited to the need for a higher gas supply to CNG \nfilling stations. \n ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will comprise two parts. Part A will prepare the Project using environmental and \ntransport data  from Greater Jakarta. Information regarding the supply of natural gas will be \nobtained  from  the  National  Oil  and  Gas  Company  (PERTAMINA),  National  Gas  Company \n(PGN),  and  the  Directorate  General  for  Oil  and  Gas  (MIGAS).  The  analysis  and \nrecommendations from previous studies will be summarized, and where necessary, further \nanalysis will be carried out to determine if the Project is justified. Other funding agencies that \nhave contributed in earlier studies in Indonesia and other developing member countries will also \nbe consulted to develop various options.  \n \n14.  The plan for clean vehicles and fuel supply for Jakarta should cover all aspects related \nto  new  investments,  including  technology  selection,  technical  specifications,  environmental \nstandards, economic and financial analysis, poverty and social impacts, safety requirements, \nenvironmental impacts, and institutional changes required to expand the use of CNG. The plan \nwill include a timetable and projection of the number of vehicles that are expected to substitute \nliquid fuel with CNG. Part A of the TA will also recommend measures to strengthen air quality \nand vehicular emission monitoring. Another important part of the TA will be to prepare a robust \nmechanism to transfer ADB-funded items (e.g., buses and conversion kits) to private sector \nusers through financial intermediaries to ensure that the funds are rolled over. The outline terms \nof reference for the consulting services for part A are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  Part  B  will  assist  the  Government  in  converting  the  MEB  action  plan  to  a  draft \nenvironmental policy (para. 5). The Government would then (i) obtain the endorsement of the \nrelated ministries, local governments, civil societies, and agencies; and (ii) formally announce \nthe policy for reducing vehicular emissions that will help establish necessary standards and \nguidelines. Part B of the TA will also provide the terms of reference for further studies to finalize \naction plans to implement complementary measures to improve urban air quality, e.g., transport \nplanning and limiting emissions from stationary sources. The outline terms and reference for \npart B are also given in Appendix 3. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.   The total cost of the TA is estimated at $758,000 equivalent, comprising $390,000 in \nforeign exchange costs and $368,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide \n$600,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $210,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $158,000 equivalent \nof the local currency costs. The cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 4. \nThe Government has been advised that providing the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The two parts of the TA will be implemented over a total period of 8 months, from \nJanuary  to  August  2003.  MIGAS  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  PGN  will  be  the \nImplementing Agency for the part A of the TA. A steering committee will be established to guide \nand monitor the project preparatory activities; it will be chaired by MIGAS, with members from \nministries and agencies, including MOE, National Development Planning Agency, PGN, and \nJakarta city government. PGN will (i) provide office space, and fulltime professional counterparts \nto work closely with the consultants; (ii) coordinate with the MOE, MIGAS, PERTAMINA, ", "5 \nResearch and Development Center for Oil and Gas Technology (LEMIGAS), city government, \npotential financial intermediaries, other external agencies, and other stakeholders to collect \nnecessary information and data related to passenger transport and vehicular emissions for \nGreater Jakarta; and (iv) help organize consultation workshops and seminars to finalize project \ndesign.  \n \n18.  Part A of the TA will be implemented over 7 months, commencing in February 2003 and \nending in August 2003. To implement part A of the TA, a consulting firm will be selected in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory  to  ADB  on  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  simplified  technical \nproposal procedure will be used for selecting a consulting firm on the basis of the quality and \nthe cost of the services (quality-and-cost-based selection). Part A of the TA will require 12 \nperson-months of international and 32 person-months of domestic consultants. The required \nexpertise will include (i) international consultants: (a) a CNG-vehicle specialist and team leader, \n(b) an environmental specialist, (c) an energy and transport economist, and (d) a natural gas \nsector and project specialist; and (ii) domestic consultants: (a) an environmental specialist and \ndeputy team leader, (b) a transport specialist, (c) an economist, (d) a financial analyst, (e)  a \nnatural gas sector specialist, (f) a project specialist, (g) a sociologist and poverty specialist, and \n(h) a financial intermediary specialist. The consultants will be required to prepare inception, \ninterim,  draft  final,  and  final  reports,  due  2  weeks,  2  months,  5  months,  and  7  months, \nrespectively, after the commencement of services. Tripartite meetings will be held in PGN for \nthe presentation and review of the interim and draft final reports. \n \n19.  MOE\u2019s Directorate for Environmental Impact Management for Non-Institutional Sources, \nwill be the Executing Agency for part B of the TA. The finalization of the policy will need to \ninvolve a wide range of stakeholders; therefore, MEB will be closely involved. Part B of the TA \nwill be implemented over 7 months, commencing in January 2003 and ending in July 2003. \nIndividual consultants will be selected  in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. Part B of the TA will require 1 person-month of international and 12 person-months \nof  domestic  consultant  services.  The  international  expert  will  require  knowledge  of \nenvironmental policy related to vehicular emissions, and the domestic experts will provide inputs \nrelated to vehicular transport and air pollution. An initial draft policy will be prepared within 3 \nmonths after work commences, a workshop will be held to obtain views from all stakeholders, \nthe draft policy will be submitted to MOE 4 months after work commences. Thereafter, the draft \npolicy will be endorsed by the local and central governments, and it will be formally announced \nat a seminar within 3 months of receiving the draft policy. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.
