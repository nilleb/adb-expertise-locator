The  principal  commitments  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  gender  and \ngovernance  reforms  in  Pakistan  are  articulated  through  two  major  programs:  the \nDecentralization Support Program (DSP)1 and the Access to Justice Program (AJP).2 Although \nthese programs provide a high-level framework for policy dialogue with the Government on \ngender and governance issues, the dialogue has been sporadic, because both programs have \nawaited a firm government commitment to a package of legislative, political, administrative, and \nfiscal reforms. These commitments are contained in gender reform action plans (GRAPs), \nprepared with ADB assistance,3 which were approved by the cabinets of the federal government \nand the provincial governments of Balochistan, Punjab and Sindh. The significance of GRAPs \nfor ADB is also reflected in policy commitments under resource management programs in \nBalochistan and Punjab, and devolved social services programs in Punjab and Sindh. ADB and \nits cofinancing partners have thus made an unprecedented effort to mainstream both corporate \nand government policy on gender through innovative and high-profile assistance.  \n \n2.  The  proposed  advisory  technical  assistance4  (TA)  will  help  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments implement the reforms and supporting actions highlighted in the GRAPs, and for \nwhich  governments  have  already  made  budgetary  commitments.  More  specifically,  the \nproposed TA will be critical to the effectiveness of the two TA loans integral to the DSP: the \nLocal  Government  Performance  Enhancement  (Loan  1937-PAK,  known  asTA1);  and  the \nGender and Governance Mainstreaming (Loan 1938-PAK, known as TA2); and to the TA loan \nsupporting the AJP.5 This will include helping the Government integrate its poverty reduction \nstrategy and medium-term fiscal management frameworks with the recently approved GRAPs at \nfederal  and  provincial  levels,  and  integrating  this  with  policy-based  operations  for  public \nresource management and devolved social services at province and local government levels.  \n \n3.  The proposed TA was designed by the Pakistan Resident Mission (PRM) during the \nconclusive phase of preparation of the GRAPs, the country program exercise (April\u2013May 2004), \nand  annual  performance  reviews  (APRs)  of  DSP  and  AJP.  The  priorities,  activities,  and \napproaches reflected in this proposed TA were defined in consultation with the Government and \ncivil society stakeholders. Appendix 1 gives the proposed TA framework.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.      Gender and Governance Reform for Poverty Reduction. Federal and provincial \ngovernments have reaffirmed their commitment to gender reforms through the poverty reduction \nstrategy papers (PRSP). The reservation of 33% of the seats in local government for women \nhas enabled many women to enter local politics. Women members constitute about 21% of \nfederal and provincial assemblies. But despite these commitments, the status of women in \nPakistan  remains  appalling.  In  the  absence  of  gender-disaggregated  data,  gender  poverty \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.

Manila (ADB \napproved TA3832-PAK, for $600,000, on 1 February 2002). \n4 The proposed advisory technical assistance (ADTA) is in the 2005 Country Program. It first appeared in ADB \nBusiness Opportunities on 12 October 2004.  \n5  The Board approved TA Loan 1899-PAK ($25.5 million) on 20 December 2001 (footnote 2). \n ", "2     \nremains largely hidden, but it is increasingly evident that poverty is feminized; women bear a \ndisproportionately high share of the burden of poverty. Global comparators give some indication \nof gender poverty in Pakistan.6\n \n5.      Statistics, however, do little to convey the experience of women in Pakistan. Oppressive \nlaws imperil their legal status. Violence against women remains an everyday experience across \nclass, region, and rural-urban divides. Women continue to be murdered in the name of male \n\u201chonor.\u201d Domestic violence is thought to take place in about 80% of the country\u2019s households, \nand custodial gang rapes by the police are so frequent that 70% of women entering police \nstations  report  they  are  subjected  to  sexual  and  physical  violence.  Child  sexual  abuse, \nkidnapping,  prostitution  and  trafficking,  and  bonded  and  hazardous  child  labor  are \ncommonplace. This occurs not just because of inadequate legal provisions, but mainly because \nimplementation of the law by federal, provincial, and local state agencies tends to take the path \nof least resistance, and favors the powerful over the weak.7\n \n6.      Administrative  and  Political  Power.  The  exclusion  of  women  from  political  and \nadministrative  governance  structures  is  strongly  linked  to  high  poverty  incidence.  Despite \nwomen\u2019s participation in political processes, women are seldom appointed to decision-making \npositions  and  their  representation  in  political  parties  is  low.  There  are  significant  gender \ndisparities in public sector employment; only 5.4% of all civil servants are women. In the federal \ngovernment, there are no women in grade 22, and women hold only 1% of grade 21 posts and \n2.5% of grade 20 posts.8 No woman serves at the Supreme Court, and only two women are \nhigh court judges. Only 6% of judges in the subordinate judiciary are women. \n \n7.     Fiscal and Budgetary Issues. The male bias in state institutions translates into under-\ninvestment in social and economic entitlements and public policies for women, and reinforces \nthe higher incidence of poverty and powerlessness among women.  Women\u2019s new political \nrepresentation  in  local  government  politics  is  a  major  achievement,  but  female  political \nrepresentatives  lack  access  to  means  of  political  participation\u2013\u2013political  skills,  financial \nresources, education, training, and information\u2013\u2013due to structural and cultural barriers, and \nmale domination of political parties and the bureaucracy.  \n \n8.      ADB\u2019s  Gender  and  Development  Focus.  ADB  fully  supports  the  PRSP  process, \ndevolution, and positive programs for gender equality. Before the approval of GRAPs, national \npolicy  was  ad  hoc  and  poorly  articulated,  with  limited  administrative  and  budgetary \ncommitments, and did not provide an effective focus for ADB\u2019s assistance. To date, ADB\u2019s \naffirmative actions on gender have largely been limited to crosscutting actions in investment \nprojects9, policy advocacy,10 and policy dialogue under DSP and AJP. The recent high-level \n                                                 \n6 The Gender-Related Development Index 2003 of the United Nations Development Programme ranks Pakistan as \nnumber 120 of 175 countries. On the Gender Empowerment Measurement 2003, Pakistan ranks 58 of 175 \ncountries.  Female literacy is only 28.8%; literacy for men is 58.2%. Pakistan is one of the few countries where the \nmale: female ratio is reversed.  There are 108 men for every 100 women. Female infant mortality and morbidity \nrates are higher than for male children. \n7  Zia, S. and F. Bari. 1999. Women\u2019s Political Participation in Pakistan.

", "  3\napproval of GRAPs provides a unique opportunity to advance and provide a focus for ADB\u2019s \nsupport  for  gender  policy  reform  in  five  key  domains:  (i)  women\u2019s  representation  in  local \ngovernment, (ii) reform of institutional structures, (iii) women in public sector employment, (iv) \nprocedural and fiscal reforms, and (v) a range of complementary reforms. Appendix 3 gives a \nbrief profile of GRAPs. \n \n9.     Technical Assistance Design Principles. The proposed TA is designed on the following \nprinciples: (i) to build upon the constituencies of support generated by TA 3832-PAK:  Gender \nReform Program; (ii) to ensure that GRAPs are implemented in a flexible and politically and \ntechnically  sustainable  manner;  (iii)  to  minimize  administrative  and  management  costs \nassociated with implementation of the proposed TA; and, (iv) to create incentives for existing \npolicy makers, staff, and consultants engaged under these operations to fully articulate GRAPs, \nconcerns in mainstream operations.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n  \nA.    Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The objective of the proposed TA is to strengthen implementation and integration of \ngender policy commitments in poverty reduction and governance reform programs and projects. \nThe proposed TA will have two outputs, each having two components. Output 1, integration of \nthe  GRAPs  into  devolution,  judicial,  and  provincial  reform  programs  for  public  resource \nmanagement,  has  two  components  (i)  supporting  implementing  agencies  (IAs)  for  GRAP \nimplementation, and (ii) supporting demand mobilization and implementation of GRAPs through \nspecial-purpose, targeted activities of limited duration.  Output 2, effective policy dialogue on \ngender reforms informed by analysis of governance programs, performance monitoring, and \nevaluation  of  results,  has  two  components  (i)  ensuring  that  governance  reform  programs\u2019 \nperformance monitoring and evaluation (PME) systems are appropriately engendered, and (ii) \nfacilitating  policy  dialogue  through  conferences  and  workshops  of  stakeholders on  GRAPs \nissues. The approach will include engaging long-term domestic consultants.  \n \nB.  Key Components  \n \n1.  Gender Reform Program Management (Component 1) \n11.  A key responsibility of the DSP program support offices (PSOs) and AJP program \nmanagement units (PMUs), both federal and provincial, is to support intergovernmental linkages \nand  overall  coherence  in  implementing  devolution  and  associated  gender  and  social \ndevelopment reforms. The proposed TA will provide one gender governance specialist in each \nprovince and one at the federal level, and one gender justice specialist, to assist in GRAPs \nimplementation through DSP and AJP. These specialists will support PSO and PMU staff in \nimplementation of GRAPs for devolution and local government reforms; for access to justice; for \nintergovernmental  fiscal  restructuring;  for  local  government  budgeting,  revenue,  and \nexpenditure management; and for the procurement and management of TA (loan and grant \nfinanced). The DSP PSOs will carry the main administrative responsibility for implementation of \nTA2. An additional contract management specialist will be engaged by the proposed TA to \naugment DSP PSO capacity with a special focus on TA2 implementation.   \n \n2.      GRAP Demand Mobilization and Implementation Support (Component 2) \n                                                                                                                                                          \n10 ADB has chaired the Inter-Agency Gender and Development Group twice in the past 3 years. Major efforts of \nadvocacy on gender equality included dialogue with the Government to engender the PRSP.    \n ", "4     \n12.  GRAPs entail commitments by governments to implement a range of administrative, \nfiscal, and political reforms. Federal and provincial governments may not prioritize or sequence \nactions in the GRAPs in the same way. Continued commitment to reforms among stakeholders, \nvisibility of reforms, and wider capacity development require technical support to several IAs \nand civil society groups to amplify and sustain demand for reforms. GRAP IAs will require \nspecial assistance to refine and implement activities drawing upon existing government budget, \nloan, and grant resources. It is important to simultaneously provide support to proponents of \nGRAP  reforms  within  civil  society\u2014professional  associations,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and activists\u2014so they may effectively interact with governments to support, monitor, \nand contribute to public awareness of the commitments made through GRAPs and related \npolicy commitments. The TA includes a gender and governance resource pool (GGRP) to \nprovide a quick-response and flexible financing facility for this purpose. Funds will be provided \nfor (i) selected activities under GRAPs; (ii) activities complementing the strategic objectives of \nGRAPs; and (iii) technical support to key GRAPs IAs. Proposals for investment from the GGRP \nmay  be  initiated  by  government  agencies  (federal,  provincial,  and  local),  civil  society \norganisations and academic institutions. Appendix 4 outlines the framework, investment menu, \nand processing guidelines for GGRP utilization. The objects and purposes of the GGRP will be \nwidely advertised with a special governance arrangement detailed and notified by the Executing \nAgency (EA). Two grant and contract management specialists will be engaged to assist PRM to \nmanage the GGRP, with support from an independent auditor. \n \n3.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (Component 3) \n13.  The Government is committed to maintaining a performance monitoring and evaluation \n(PME) system for governance reforms to serve three purposes (i) demonstrate accountable use \nof public resources available to IAs through the normal budget process and special-purpose, \nexternally supported capacity-building projects; (ii) ensure that budget and technical resources, \nwell-tailored to IA requirements, are allocated to priority activities supporting devolution, and that \nincentives are created for their effective use; and (iii) progressively evaluate and inform policy \nmakers of the impact of reforms on access, equity, and sustainability of services. The proposed \nTA will provide one long-term policy research and evaluation specialist to document compliance \nwith GRAPs investment commitments and outputs in AJP, DSP, and ADB public resource \nmanagement and devolved social services programs.  \n \n4.  Policy Dialogue and Public Communications (Component 4) \n14.  The TA will provide Government, civil society, and Pakistan\u2019s aid partners with strategic \ninformation, based on well-researched lessons from experience, to regularly review, and where \nnecessary, modify the legal, policy, and organizational arrangements for the GRAPs. Policy and \nprogram lessons from a range of nationwide and province-specific gender reform projects and \ninitiatives will be researched and publicized through electronic and print media, professional \nconferences, and wider public exchanges. One gender communications specialist will work with \nkey IAs on the basis of quarterly work plans agreed upon in DSP and AJP planning process.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $5.6 million equivalent, comprising all local currency with no \nforeign exchange cost component. The TA will be financed on a grant basis under (i) ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program ($100,000), (ii) ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund ($800,000), and \n(iii) cofinancing from the Government of Canada, Canadian International Development Agency \n($3,665,000).11  ADB  will  administer  all  funds  from  the  cofinanciers.  The  Government  will \n                                                 \n11 Using an exchange rate of Canadian dollars 1.22783 to US dollars 1.00. ", "  5\ncontribute $1,115,000 equivalent in local currency for office accommodation and counterpart staff \nsupport. Appendix 2 summarizes the cost estimates. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The proposed TA will be implemented for 36 months from May 2005 to May 2008 and will be \nadministered by ADB PRM. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will be the EA for this proposed TA under \nthe existing DSP implementation arrangements, with the following responsibilities (i) approve annual \nwork plans and budgets; (ii) assist in ADB short-listing of consultants for subprojects of less than \n$500,000; (iii) approve progress and annual reports; and (iv) approve annual performance review \n(APR) outcomes. The MoF is also the EA for DSP TA loans. Reports on progress of the proposed \nTA will be provided to the DSP national program steering committee. \n \n17.  The proposed TA will require 621 person-months of domestic consulting services. ADB will \nengage all consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB. The indicative consultants\u2019 recruitment plan in Appendix 4 details \nthree different arrangements for recruiting consultants: (i) ADB engaging, on an individual basis, two \ndomestic consultants and an independent auditor (87 person-months); (ii) eight long-term domestic \nconsultants (270 person-months) provided in a package by a consultant firm; and (iii) provided in a \npackage by four consultant firms and eight domestic consultants (264 person-months) engaged \nthrough GGRP-funded subprojects to implement initiatives under components 2, 3, and 4 of the \nproposed TA. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for consultants in points (i) and (ii). \nADB will be responsible for the outputs and deliverables of all individual consultants and consultants \ncontracted under the GRRP through the DSP advisory technical assistance team leader appointed \nunder  TA4207-PAK:  Support  to  Decentralization  II.  All  consultants  will  be  subject  to  annual \nperformance assessment. \n \n18.  Under the GGRP, consultants will be selected (point [iii] para. 17) under ADB Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. An estimated total of six \npackages in each of years 1 and 2 with an annual projection of two packages implemented by \ndomestic consultant firms and three by individual consultants. The GGRP packages will not exceed \n$500,000. Because of the innovative and complex nature and scope of the packages, it is proposed \nto use a quality-based selection method for selecting consultant firms. In year 2 the direct selection \nmethod may also be considered as appropriate if the firms or individuals perform well in year 1. The \nperformance of all GGRP-financed subprojects will be subject to quarterly review, and annual review \nthrough  the  AJP  and  DSP  APRs,  which  will  include  both  program  and  financial  management \nreviews. The consultants engaged to implement GGRP-financed subprojects will be subject to audit \nconducted by independent auditors appointed by ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,665,000 to the Government of Pakistan for Support to \nImplementation of Gender Reform Action Plans, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government \nof Canada.  If the Board approves ADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting \nunder the authority delegated by the Board, will approve (i) ADB administering a portion of the \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nPoverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund,  and  (ii)  ADB  providing  the  balance  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $100,000 on a grant basis, for Support to Implementation of Gender Reform Action \nPlans, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets /  Data Sources / Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators  Mechanisms \nImpact  TA and capital resources  APR analysis of  Risks \nGender policy  match the GRAP priorities  governance program work  \u2022 Resources are not \ncommitments in poverty    plans and technical  provided in a sufficient, \nreduction and governance  assistance effectiveness  timely, or predictable \nreform programs and  fashion \nprojects implemented   \n  Annual increase in govt.

Introduction \n \n1.  One national and four provincial gender reform action plans (GRAPs) were prepared \nby the Ministry of Women Development and provincial women development departments in \na consultative and review process of 14 months, under the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ntechnical assistance project TA3832-PAK: Gender Reform Program.   \n \n2.  GRAPs include gender-based policy, administrative, political, and fiscal reforms at \nthe federal, provincial, and district levels to enable the Government to implement its national \nand international commitments on gender equality. The federal cabinet and the Punjab, \nSindh, and Balochistan cabinets have approved their respective GRAPs. \n \nB.  Process and Methodology for Development of Gender Reform Action Plans  \n \n3.  Gender review of the political and administrative systems of Pakistan was the first \nstep  in  a  process  that  culminated  with  the  national  GRAP.  This  process  began  with \nidentification and scoping of gender issues and the identification of gender gaps through \nsituation  assessment  and  analysis.  This  was  followed  by  processing  of  learning  and \nsynthesis  of  ideas;  and  consultation  workshops,  meetings,  and  presentations  to  key \nministries. Comments and suggestions from this process were incorporated. A second draft \nwas then prepared and shared with key ministries.  \n \n4.  Draft GRAPs were reviewed and cleared for cabinet submission by the provincial and \nnational  steering  committees  comprising  parliamentarians  from  major  political  parties, \nfederal  and  provincial  cabinet  members,  representatives  of  key  federal  ministries  and \nprovincial  governments,  selected  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  donor \nagencies.      \n \nC.  Scope of Gender Reform Action Plans \n5.  The GRAPs propose reforms at the federal, provincial, and district level across all \nsectors focused on the executive arm of government. These reforms focus on women\u2019s \nempowerment, and aim to enhance the participation of women across the gender and \ngovernance  sphere:  from  political  participation,  where  citizens\u2019  wishes  are  expressed \nthrough political mandates and legislation, to government actions, where those wishes are \nimplemented through public sector institutions, policies, and budgets. \n \n6.  GRAPs include the following reforms:   \n \n(i)  Key Reforms \n(a)  Institutional reforms;  \n(b)  Reforms in policies, budgeting, and public expenditure mechanisms; \n(c)  Reforms  to  increase  and  improve  women\u2019s  employment  in  public \nsector organizations;     \n(d)  Reforms to improve women\u2019s political participation; and \n(e)  Related capacity-building interventions \n \n(ii)  Supporting Reforms \n(a)  Legislative support actions, \n(b)  Poverty reduction support actions, and \n(c)  Projects and programs \n \n ", "10    Appendix 3     \n7.  GRAPs also include estimated costs and a financing plan, an implementation plan, \nand a monitoring system.  \n \n8.  Separate reform proposals have been developed for the four provincial governments \nand for the federal government. \n \nD.  Estimated Cost and Financing  \n \n9.  The total estimated cost of all five GRAPs over 4 years is about $41 million, to be \nfinanced through various bilateral, multilateral, and government sources.
