The Government of Sri Lanka (the Government) requested assistance from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in building the capacity of its Sustainable Energy Authority. The \nconcept paper for advisory technical assistance (TA) was approved in October 2007 for ADB\u2019s \n2007 TA program for Sri Lanka. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Sri Lanka from 29 October to \n2 November 2007 and reached an understanding with the Government on the objective, scope, \ncost estimates, counterpart funding, and implementation arrangements of the TA.1 The TA will \nfocus on strengthening staff capacity in the Sustainable Energy Authority to promote private \nsector investment in renewable energy projects and develop policy and financial instruments for \nthem. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sri Lanka\u2019s power sector struggled through the late 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s to \nmeet growing demand for electricity and will face another crisis in the near future unless various \nsector issues are addressed in a timely manner. Delay in implementing the Government\u2019s long-\nterm plan for expanding generation capacity is expected to create a shortage of about 400 \nmegawatts (MW) in 2008 and reduce the reserve margin from 9.5% in 2007 to only 2% in 2008. \nAs  demand  for  power  is  growing  at  about  8%  per  year,  further  delay  will  extend  power \nshortages beyond 2008 and create significant impediments to economic growth.  \n3.  Sri Lanka\u2019s national electrification ratio improved significantly from 10.9% in 1986 to 75% \nin 2005 and compares very favorably with those of other South Asian countries. However, \nsubstantial disparities in access to electricity still exist. As of end-2005, per capita electricity \nconsumption stood at about 366 kilowatt-hours (kWh), which is lower than in India and Pakistan. \nSystem losses are estimated at 16.7%. While this is relatively low compared to the average in \nthe region, there is still room for reducing losses at distribution by another 4\u20135%.  \n4.  In Sri Lanka, the total capacity for power generation available to the grid was 2,414 MW \nat the end of 2006. Of the total energy provided to the grid, 37.7% is hydro, 58.2% is thermal \n(oil), and 4.1% is unconventional renewable energy. The hydro share in the power generation \nmix dramatically declined from 99.7% in 1986 to 37.7% in 2006 as indigenous resources have \nnot been developed at the same pace as demand growth, which has been met primarily by oil-\nfired thermal generation. This trend needs to be changed to regain the favorable energy security \nsituation that prevailed in the past and gave the country resilience in the midst of escalating \nfossil fuel prices.  \n5.  The 1998 policy of building only thermal power plants with private financing has resulted \nin a proliferation of relatively small, high-cost oil-fired plants. The lack of appropriate political \ndecisions and financial resources has left the Government unable to implement its long-term \nplan for expanding generation capacity, in which coal is proposed as the most economical \nsource of energy. Coupled with the recent fuel price hike and delayed construction of new \nhydropower plants, this change of generation mix has significantly pushed up generation cost. \nThe urgent need exists to build up base-load generation capacity with low-cost fuels such as \nimported coal, hydro, and renewable resources. \n 6.  Increased penetration of indigenous resources, reduced consumption of fossil fuels, and \ndiversification into cheaper fuels are the few options available to Sri Lanka. To address these \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 October 2007.  ", "2\nissues, the National Energy Policy and Strategies (NEPS) in 2006 identified the development of \nrenewable energy sources and demand-side energy efficiency improvement as major strategic \npillars.  A  10-year  development  plan  that  was  prepared  to  implement  the  NEPS  aims  to \n(i) increase the percentage of households electrified through off-grid supply from 4% at present \nto 10% by 2016, (ii) increase the share of unconventional renewable energy in on-grid power \nsupply from 4.1% at present to 10.7% by 2016, (iii) add 500 MW of renewable energy capacity \nby 2016, (iv) introduce the labeling of appliances for energy efficiency by 2010, and (v) update \nand make mandatory energy-efficient building codes by 2009.  \n7.  To strengthen the institutional framework toward achieve these targets, the Government \nenacted new legislation to convert the Energy Conservation Fund, a unit under the Ministry of \nPower  and  Energy,  into  a  statutory  body  called  the  Sustainable  Energy  Authority  (SEA). \nMandated to develop and implement the country\u2019s policy for renewable energy development, \ndemand-side  energy-efficiency  improvement,  and  energy  conservation,  SEA  became \noperational  on  1 October  2007.  In  addition,  the  Government  recently  introduced  new \ntechnology-specific  multi-tier  tariffs  to  attract  more  private  investment  for  unconventional \nrenewable energy projects.\n8.  SEA will play a pivotal role in promoting renewable energy development by helping \nprivate sector investors to (i) identify potential projects, (ii) obtain all necessary government \nclearances,  (iii)  access  government  subsidies  from  the  Sri  Lanka  sustainable  energy  fund \nmanaged by SEA, and (iv) enter into power-purchase agreements with the Ceylon Electricity \nBoard. It will also develop and implement new policies and financing schemes for renewable \nenergy development, energy efficiency improvement, and energy conservation. SEA has taken \nover from the Energy Conservation Fund an office and staff of 50 including 15 professionals and \nplans to recruit 75 additional staff including 58 professionals. \n9.  SEA  has  four  functional  groups:  (i)  economic  affairs,  (ii)  knowledge  management, \n(iii) energy  management,  and  (iv)  renewable  energy.  Economic  affairs  and  knowledge \nmanagement have a strategic, long-term focus and are under the supervision of the deputy \ndirector general (strategy), while the other two have a more operational and medium-term focus \nunder the supervision of the deputy director general (operations). Three divisions are placed \nunder each director, and three divisions for corporate support functions come directly under the \ndirector general. Six divisions under the deputy director general (operations) are tasked with \npromoting renewable energy development and projects to improve energy efficiency. The three \ndivisions under the director (energy efficiency) will receive capacity-building support from the \nJapan International Cooperation Agency.   \n10.  Support for building capacity and institutions is urgently needed for nine divisions under \nanother three directors. In particular, the three divisions under the director (renewable energy) \nwill require immediate support as they will play a critical role in promoting renewable energy \nprojects and already have many applications for immediate review despite not being fully staffed \nwith  experienced  professionals.  These  divisions  include  the  resource  development  division \n(RDD), resource allocation division (RAD), and exploration and facilitation division (EFD). RDD \nwill be responsible for identifying, assessing, and inventorying renewable energy resources in \nthe country and will provide information to resource-development agencies to improve their \ninvestment decisions. RAD will publish resource maps and inventories and grant approvals to \ndevelopers for the use of renewable resources. EFD will explore new resources and link energy \nchains between them and all possible end users. This division will also design packages of \nmeasures to open up the possibilities of using the new resources. The divisions under the \ndirector  (economic  affairs)  and  director  (knowledge  management)  will  require  technical ", "3\nassistance for developing policy frameworks and financial instruments to ensure the sustainable \ndevelopment of renewable resources. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen the institutional capacity and technical capability \nof  SEA  to  facilitate  and  coordinate  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  the  sustainable \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources.    \n12.  The outcome of the TA will be building within SEA adequate capacity and technical \nknowledge of (i) managing a portfolio of renewable energy projects including the identification, \nassessment, documentation, and inventorying of all renewable energy resources in the country \nand  providing  quality  information  to  project  developers;  and  (ii)  creating  an  enabling \nenvironment to encourage investments to significantly enhance renewable energy generation \nthrough  the  development  of  relevant  policies,  integrated  resource  planning,  and  financial \nincentives in various economic sectors.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will include two components to be implemented in parallel. For Component 1, TA \nconsultants  will  (i)  lay  out  SEA\u2019s  procedures  and  manuals  for  processing  applications  for \nrenewable energy projects, (ii) provide staff of RAD with hands-on support for the application \nreview process, and (iii) help SEA provide immediate training to RAD staff. This component is \ndesigned to help SEA achieve its short-term target of issuing provisional approvals for up to 100 \nMW of additional renewable energy-generation capacity by end-2008.  \n14.  Component 2 will focus on institutional and capacity development in SEA for its medium- \nand long-term objectives. The TA consultants will (i) prepare a 10-year SEA action plan for \nrenewable energy development; (ii) define the scope of work of RDD and EFD and identify \nwhich tasks to keep in house and which to outsource; (iii) draft business procedures, operational \nmanuals, and coordination guidelines for RDD and EFD; (iv) review and propose necessary \nmodifications  to  draft  job  descriptions  for  senior  officers  of  RDD  and  EFD;  (v)  develop  a \ntransitional plan to manage human resources for the renewable energy and economic affairs \ngroups on meeting human resource requirements to fulfill SEA\u2019s immediate mandates under \nresource constraints; (v) develop and implement a medium-term capacity-development program \nfor the renewable energy, knowledge management, and economic affairs groups; (vi) establish \ndetailed financial resource requirements and possible sources of funding for the management of \nthe proposed Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Fund to support the funding of renewable energy \nand energy-efficiency projects for 10 years; and (vii) propose policy and financial instruments to \npromote investment in renewable energy projects. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA total cost is estimated at $750,000 equivalent. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. This amount will be financed as a grant by the Clean \nEnergy Fund2 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. \n                                                \n2 Contributor: the governments of Australia and Norway.
