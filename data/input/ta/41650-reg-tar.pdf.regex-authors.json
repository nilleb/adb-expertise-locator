INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB), for the past 12 years, has funded the preparation \nof Pacific Island economic reports (PIERs) on developing member countries (DMCs) in the \nPacific under the Pacific Studies Series.1 This series also includes ADB-funded studies and \nassessments of the environment, governance, gender, sector development, economic policy, \nand other thematic issues. All these studies have been done to keep the Pacific DMCs, ADB, \nother  development  partners,  and  other  interested  parties  better  informed  and  up  to  date \nregarding the economic and social status, trends, and key development issues in the Pacific \nDMCs and better able to formulate more effective policies for the region.  \n \n2.  Since 1997, the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) and ADB \nhave shared in the preparation of the economic reports, which now number more than 20. The \nCook Islands PIER for 2001 was also cofinanced by New Zealand\u2019s International Aid and \nDevelopment  Agency.  Moreover,  in  keeping  with  its  dedicated  support  for  greater  donor \ncoordination  and  harmonization  to  meet  the  objectives  of  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid \nEffectiveness,2 ADB is committed to carrying out further joint analyses of development issues \nwith other major donors to the subregion.3 The proposed technical assistance (TA) is based on \na review of previous Pacific studies, discussions with other major donors, the Pacific Strategy \n2005\u20132009,4  and  the  outcomes  of  earlier  TA  aimed  at  poverty  reduction.5  Pacific  DMC \ngovernments  were  consulted  in  determining  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation \narrangements. Professional sector and thematic staff assessed the priority needs for further \nwork with regional donors and government agencies. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.6  \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  As recorded in the Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009, the Pacific region as a whole has had \nweakly  performing  economies  and  social  conditions  that  have  made  slower  progress  than \nhoped. Hardship and poverty remain key issues. ADB has worked over the past 5 years through \nthe Pacific Studies Series to widen understanding of these conditions and acceptance of the \nneed for change.7 Earlier TA established the priorities of the poor, and also assessed the \npro-poor value of government development policies and strategies. This work, like the earlier \nstudies in the Pacific Studies Series, brought out the importance of government-led policy and \ninstitutional  reforms  in  making  public  service  delivery  more  productive  and  in  creating  an \nenvironment more conducive to private sector development in the face of weak capacity in \nmany Pacific DMCs, specifically in policy research, analysis, reporting, and basic administration. \n                                                 \n1  PIERs have been prepared every 4 or 5 years, though not for all Pacific DMCs. \n2   Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Paris, March 2005. \n3 At the Trilateral Donor Coordination and Harmonization meeting in Sydney, Australia, on 20\u201321 August 2007 \nAusAID promised to \u201cconsider how it can encourage staff to engage with the ADB\u2019s analytical work early.\u201d \n4  ADB. 2004.

Pollard. 2004. Hardship and Poverty in the Pacific. Manila: ADB.  ", " 2      \n \n4.  After extensive thematic and sector analyses of the region, the Pacific Strategy 2005\u2013\n2009 (footnote 4), anchored the strategic priorities for ADB\u2019s engagement in the region in the \ncommon priorities of the poor. The strategic priorities, reconfirmed in the midterm review of the \nstrategy, consist of support for (i) an environment conducive to private sector development, to \nimprove  income  and  market  opportunities;  (ii)  physical  economic  and  social  infrastructure, \nincluding health, education, clean water, and sanitation facilities; and (iii) better governance. \nThe country strategies of the individual Pacific DMCs are being updated and refined to conform \nto the Pacific strategy. Cross-sector, thematic road maps are also being drawn up for each \ncountry to shape future assistance programs. All these analyses will need to be kept up to date \nand strengthened through analytical work. The national development plans and strategies must \nsimilarly be strengthened if they are to have any impact on reducing poverty. \n \n5.  The  theory  and  experience  needed  to  guide  poverty  reduction  is  embodied  in  the \ndevelopment  policies  and  strategies  of  development  agencies,  including  ADB.  ADB\u2019s \nconceptual framework links policies and strategies to steer poverty reduction efforts.8 Since \n1995, the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat has produced a series of communiqu\u00e9s for its \nannual meetings and meetings of the Forum economic ministers. The governments of all Pacific \nmember countries of the Forum9 have signed these communiqu\u00e9s, and committed themselves \nto implementing improved policies. But a report prepared for the Secretariat in 2002 showed \nthat few of the policies and strategies have been implemented. The principles and options for \nimplementation\u2014what works in reducing poverty\u2014must continue to be disseminated, promoted, \nand put into practice in the region.  \n \n6.  The region\u2019s leaders and civil society will benefit from support in setting up, negotiating, \nand implementing the required reforms, given the limited understanding of the reforms and the \nmany difficulties involved in making changes in small, closely knit, and traditional civil societies. \nGovernment leaders and civil society, working together, must create a constituency for reform \nand  devise  implementation  strategies  to  improve  development  decisions.  The  participatory \nprocesses used by the Pacific DMC governments to build support for development policy and \ndevelopment strategies deserve to be encouraged and strengthened. \n \n7.  Efforts to further develop and disseminate public policy discussion through the Pacific \nStudies Series must continue. These efforts must also be made to involve civil society more \nclosely in the design and implementation of pro-poor public policies and strategies, to improve \ngovernance. The findings of a special study of capacity development in the Pacific in 200710, \njointly funded by AusAID, reinforced the need for more extensive participation and for longer-\nterm assistance programs.  \n \n8.  As noted in TA completion reports,11 governments, societies, and interested partners in \ndevelopment greatly appreciated the comprehensive treatment of Pacific economies in the \nearlier Pacific Studies Series reports.12 Those studies covered broad economic trends, while \nalso analyzing selected sectors or themes in more detail. Less attention was paid to the deeper \n                                                 \n8  Duncan, R., and S. Pollard. 2002.

", "     3 \n   \nendemic and systemic constraints on public and private sector productivity, and on investment \nyield. These constraints exist because society cannot create, and government cannot meet, \neffective demand for better-run, better-organized, and better-managed public services and a \nfavorable  business  climate.  With  increasing  urbanization  in  the  region  and  growing  media \ncoverage, all Pacific DMCs have the chance to analyze and discuss public policy before a much \nwider audience, and to engage that audience in designing pro-poor public policies and tracking \ntheir implementation. Demand for pro-poor public policies is growing, even as civil society \norganizations  throughout  the  region  are  gaining  capacity  and  interest  in  formulating  such \npolicies.  \n \n9.  The region looks to the Pacific Studies Series for impartial and fair treatment of key \ndevelopment issues. The Pacific Studies Series can still be used to focus attention on the \ndeeper, binding constraints on poverty reduction, complementing the assessments of the private \nsector environment in the Pacific DMCs made under other regional TA.13 These private sector \nassessments are notable for their emphasis on the use of improved communication tools, \nincluding  policy  briefing  notes  and  locally  organized  advocacy  events,  to  increase  local \nownership. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The proposed regional TA will produce economic and social updates, other sector and \nthematic  assessments,  and  pro-poor  policy  options  and  development  strategies  under  the \numbrella of the Pacific Studies Series, to be used by the Pacific DMC governments, civil society, \nand  the  media.  As  a  result,  the  Pacific  DMCs  will  benefit  from  a  better  understanding  of \ndevelopment  issues,  strategies,  and  policies  for  reducing  hardship  and  poverty.  The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be aimed at strengthening the participatory drafting of pro-poor policy \noptions and strategies for reducing poverty and hardship in each country. Policy analyses will \nhelp  identify  key  institutional  reform  and  capacity  development  priorities  to  enable  the \ngovernments to deliver effective and sustainable pro-poor services. The analytical framework \nwill be guided by the Pacific Strategy 2005\u20132009 and documents that supported the preparation \nof the strategy, especially the conceptual framework for poverty reduction (footnote 12). The TA \nwill  employ  and  build  on  policy  development  ownership  in  each  country  and  national \nconsultative and participation processes.14 Indicative studies and sample terms of reference are \nincluded in Appendix 4. Study selection and approach are further guided by earlier work on \nestablishing the \u201cpriorities of the people.\u201d15 While study outlines will remain firm, implementation \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2006.

A highly participatory approach, including the facilitation of dialogue with governments, \nNGOs, civil society organizations, and private sector stakeholders, will be taken. Wherever \nfeasible, joint analyses will be made by government, civil society, and donors. Donor partners \nwill be informed early about planned activities so these can be prepared jointly where there is a \ncommon interest and timetable. Existing coordination mechanisms within the region, such as \nthe Fiji-based meetings set up to coordinate economic TA, will be used to discuss all planned \neconomic, sector, and thematic work and to avoid duplication.17 \n \n13.  National consultants will be hired wherever feasible, to strengthen domestic policy \nformulation.  The  outcome  of  national  consultation  workshops  will  be  considered  in  the \npreparation and review of the TA findings. The TA study results will be disseminated extensively \nin various formats and in Pacific languages appropriate to each Pacific DMC, and directed to a \nrange of audiences within and outside the country. To maximize audience reach, consultants \nwill be hired to prepare policy briefs on economic and poverty issues drawing on the larger \ncountry, sector, and thematic studies and responding to topical policy issues. These policy \nbriefs will be presented in a nontechnical, reader-friendly manner and integrated with existing \nactivities with the regional media. Highly valued by all governments and development partners, \nthe studies provide the basis for future policy formulation. Participatory approaches within the \nTA together with regular policy dialogue and other country program work will help ensure \nimplementation of policy recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.90 million. It will be cofinanced with a grant of $400,000 \nfrom the Government of Australia18, to be administered by ADB. ADB will finance the remaining \n$1.5 million with a grant from its TA funding program. The funding from the Government of \nAustralia  will  cover  the  national  reports\u2014Pacific  Island  economic  reports  and  country \nenvironmental assessments\u2014in component A.19 The rest of component A (national reporting) \nas well as component B (thematic studies) will be funded by ADB. The cost estimates are given \nin Appendix 2.20 \n \n \n \n                                                 \n16 Overall the study seeks to answer why the region is underperforming, what changes in public policy are needed, \nand how development partners can help the region manage change.  \n17 The Fiji Islands meetings are covered by an agreement (dated November 2007) among the Pacific Financial \nTechnical  Assistance  Center  (PFTAC)  in  Fiji  Islands,  the  World  Bank,  and  ADB  to  engage  in  substantial \ncollaboration among themselves and with other multilateral and bilateral donors in the Pacific to harmonize \ntechnical assistance. At the regular meetings in Suva the Pacific donors share information about economic and \nfiscal management and regulation. \n18 Financed through the Memorandum of Understanding on Channel Financing (Technical Assistance Program) \nbetween the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia and Asian Development Bank. \n19 AusAID plans to use the PIERs as the basis of an appraisal of the contribution of economic country reporting to \npolicy debate and reform in the Pacific. This appraisal is likely to take place midway through the regional TA or after \nthe completion of the Fiji Islands and Solomon Islands PIERs, and will be funded separately by AusAID. \n20 The cost of preparing earlier Pacific Studies Series and other assessments and participatory processes was \nconsidered in the preparation of the budget. ", "     5 \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Executing Agency will be ADB. The Implementing Agency will be ADB\u2019s Pacific \nDepartment  (PARD)  for  Palau,  Federated  States  of  Micronesia,  and  Republic  of  Marshall \nIslands (RMI), and the PARD resident missions for the other Pacific DMCs.21 PARD staff will \ncoordinate with staff of all other relevant donors as appropriate. The assessments will be \nimplemented in close association with high-level officials of each Pacific DMC, and with relevant \nPacific DMC ministries and offices of economic policy formulation, economic planning, and \nstatistics generation. These ministries and offices will help coordinate domestic contributions \nfrom the civil society and national consultants, depending on individual capacity to make such \ncontributions. ADB will continue to coordinate the Pacific Studies Series and other assessments \nwith other donors. The PARD desk officers concerned will submit to the regional management \nteam for approval before implementation the proposed schedule, detailed terms of reference, \nand budget for each Pacific DMC assessment. These same desk officers will be responsible for \nmanaging the updates and the pro-poor policy briefs for each Pacific DMC. \n \n16.  ADB will recruit development economists and team leaders (15 person-months); team \neconomists  and  social  scientists  (20  person-months);  participatory  planners \n(15 person-months);  public  sector,  governance,  and  capacity  development  specialists \n(20 person-months);  an  economic  analyst  (12  to  18  person-months);  and  a  research  and \nnational  program  coordinator  (36  person-months).  Editor(s)  (4  person-months)  and  layout \nspecialist(s)  (2  person-months)  will  also  be  required  from  time  to  time  to  guide  report \npreparation, presentation, and widespread dissemination. Given earlier TA experience and the \nneed  to  recruit  highly  specialized  consultants  with  particular  experience,  ADB  will  hire  all \nindividual consultants through the Individual Consultant System according to the Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). General terms of reference are \nprovided in Appendix 3.22 The final terms of reference will differ for each Pacific DMC and each \nassessment; however, an example for RMI is given in Appendix 4 with a draft outline of potential \nassessments and their justification. Assistance to each Pacific DMC will not commence until \nsuch time as ADB has received a no objection letter from the Pacific DMC government. The TA \nis expected to start in June 2008 and to be completed by the end of 2010.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  on  a  grant  basis,  for  Strengthening  Pacific \nEconomic Analysis and Policy Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n21 The South Pacific Subregional Office will be the Implementing Agency for the Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, \nSamoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu; the Papua New Guinea (PNG) Resident Mission for PNG; the Pacific Liaison and \nCoordination Office in Sydney for Nauru, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu; and the Special Office in Timor-Leste for \nthat country. \n22 The appended terms of reference provide a regional framework. Individual terms of reference will be prepared for \neach Pacific DMC. While pro-poor policy covers many areas of development policy, priority areas of pro-poor policy \nwill be determined for each Pacific DMC on the basis of current and developing social, political, and economic \nstatus and trends. Not all areas of pro-poor policy can be reviewed in detail. Some assessments may focus more \non governance, others on the environment for private sector development, and still others on gender, governance, \nsocial protection, and public resource allocation and essential public services. A strong sector focus might be \njustified in some cases. The pro-poor development strategy assessments that were drafted for eight of the Pacific \nDMCs under RETA 6002 and 6047 (footnote 5) will help determine areas of priority.

The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  cover:  (i)  research,  analysis,  report  writing, \npublication, government and public presentation, and government and public discussion of \neconomic and social updates and other sector and thematic assessments for each Pacific \ndeveloping  member  country  (DMC);  and  (ii)  participatory  consideration  of  pro-poor  policy \noptions and development strategies as relevant to the same Pacific DMCs. Given the projected \nnumber and range of assessments and analyses, it is not possible at this point to state all terms \nof reference to the level of detail that will be required for consultant recruitment. Indicative terms \nof reference based on earlier exercises follow. \n \n2.  The work will be done in a phased manner, with research and analyses providing \ninformation to make informed participation possible. Summary economic and social updates and \nother sector and thematic assessments will inform participatory discussions of pro-poor policy \noptions. The individual consultants will coordinate their work schedules and fully engage the \nparticipation of the national consultants, civil society, and staff of the ministry, department, or \noffice  of  economic  policy  formulation,  planning,  and  statistics  in  each  Pacific  DMC,  as \nappropriate. \n \n3.  The assessments, updates, and policy options will draw on all relevant literature, data, \nand analyses, including (i) national plans and national strategies of the Pacific DMCs; (ii) other \nPacific  DMC  documentation;  (iii)  International  Monetary  Fund  Article  IV  Public  Information \nNotes; (iv) other bilateral, multilateral, and donor analyses; (v) earlier Pacific Island economic \nreports (PIERs); (vi) participatory poverty assessments of the Asian Development Bank (ADB); \n(vii) earlier sector and thematic reports; and (viii) other assessments of national policies and \nstrategies as they affect hardship and poverty reduction. \n \n4.  A mix of individual national and international consultants will draft the assessments, \nupdates, and policy options, with the makeup of the team determined by the capacity of each \nPacific DMC and the availability of consultants. A team leader will manage the process under \nthe  guidance  of  the  relevant  ADB  desk  officer  for  each  Pacific  DMC.  The  ADB  Pacific \nDepartment, together with desk officers and desk economists in the Pacific DMC resident \nmissions,  will  manage  the  preparation  of  the  Pacific  DMC  reports  and  the  provision  of \nappropriate Pacific DMC documentation. They will coordinate for that purpose with individual \ncountry program managers of other donors as appropriate. \n \nA.  Economic and Social Updates and Related Assessments \n \n5.  Development  Economists/Team  Leaders  (international  or  national  or  both,  about \n15 person-months, intermittent). A development economist and team leader will be appointed \nfor each economic and social update. This person will have extensive experience (more than \n15 years) analyzing the macroeconomies of developing societies, preferably including Pacific \nisland economies. The PIER work is likely to be done in two phases\u2014analytical work in the first \nphase, and participatory dissemination of findings and recommendations in the second. Working \nunder the guidance of the desk officer or desk economist in the ADB Pacific DMC, this person \nwill \n \n(i)  Provide intellectual leadership and guidance to the consultancy team, and see \nthe  TA  through  to  submission  of  draft  final  reports  and  publication  of  final \nmanuscripts.

A draft Pacific DMC economic and social update and assessment will be produced \nwithin 1 month of the start of the TA. This will be followed by a pre-publication draft final report \nwithin the second month, and a final report by the third month of the start of the TA. Each Pacific \nDMC macroeconomist/team leader will visit Manila or resident missions (as relevant), as well as \nother donor offices (as required). These trips will be made at the start and at the end of each \nproject to allow briefing and debriefing, and to work with Pacific Department (PARD) and donor \nstaff to finalize the required documentation. \n \nB.  Public and Private Sector Performance, Productivity, and Capacity Development \n \n9.  Assessments  of  private  sector  performance,  environment,  productivity,  and  capacity \ndevelopment needs are likely to be undertaken under the regional Private Sector Development \nInitiative.3 The proposed TA will collaborate closely with the latter in the implementation of TA \nactivities. \n \n10.  The pro-poor policy options and development strategies will vary depending on the \nneeds of each Pacific DMC. The terms of reference will be tailored to these needs. Individual \ncountry needs might require, for example, that the terms of reference focus more on the impact \nof  the  political  economy,  potential  for  capacity  development,  potential  for  further  structural \nadjustment; or further state-owned enterprise reform; or land and other factor mobilization, \nregulatory reform, and the easing of administrative barriers (private sector reform); or the means \nof improving civil service personnel management, public sector capacity development, public \nexpenditure review, or specific welfare reform. \n \n11.  However,  as  directed  under  the  Pacific  Strategy  2005\u20132009,4  all  Pacific  DMC \nrequirements will most likely incorporate cross-sector public and private sector productivity and \nperformance, and strengthened participatory governance and development, as priority needs. \nWherever  possible,  Pacific  Island  professionals  will  be  given  preference  in  recruitment. \nPreference will also be given to consultants with experience in participatory process planning. \n \n12.

Strengthening Pro-Poor Policy in the Republic of the Marshall Islands: Terms of \nReference and Study Outline \n \n1.  In the case of the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), summaries of the state of \npro-poor policy in the Pacific will first be prepared in Manila. International and national (from \nRMI) consultants will analyze, report on, and present summaries of the social and economic \nstatus and trends. The latter work will update Republic of the Marshall Islands: METO 2000 \nEconomic Report and Statement of Development Strategies, which was published by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in April 2001, among other documentation. While the pro-poor policy \nconsensus and the social and economic updates might overlap, they will precede and help \ninform in-country, participatory drafting of pro-poor policy for government consideration. \n \n2.  Although the areas of policy analyses and formulation have not been decided, the focus \nin RMI is likely to be on (i) private sector development; (ii) public resource allocation, including a \nreview of public expenditures; and (iii) local taxation. \n \n3.  A series of workshops will be convened. Each will have up to 25 participants from (i) the \nbusiness  community,  including  the  chamber  of  commerce;  (ii)  the  Marshall  Islands\u2019 \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs); (iii) irioj (hereditary chief) and other traditional leaders; \n(iv) church groups; (v) local government; and (vi) the central Government. Each workshop will \nbe split into three groups, each of which will focus on participatory exercises structured to suit \nthe experience and skills of the group members. These groups will identify stakeholders (for the \ngovernance and management of poverty reduction initiatives), inventory social institutions, and \nconduct political mapping, policy mapping, and analyses. After each exercise, the groups will \ncompare their results and discuss differences in perspective or content. Then they will consider \npossible changes, including policy changes, to promote new activities and get around the \nstumbling blocks that they identified. Each group will select a member to prepare and present a \nsummary of the group results at a larger meeting. Dialogue at that meeting will seek to establish \nareas of consensus, and then to address areas of disagreement to foster clarity and agreement \non  (i)  needed  policy  changes,  (ii)  possible  activities  to  promote  poverty  reduction,  and \n(iii) specific plans for at least one or two new ways of operating. Where agreement has been \nreached,  national  and  international  consultants,  as  relevant,  will  assist  the  participants  in \ndrafting policy options for submission to the executive branch of the Government for review and \nconsideration. \n \n4.  Individual  RMI  consultants  and  the  Marshall  Islands  Council  of  NGOs\u2014all  with \nexperience in facilitating such workshops\u2014will facilitate these workshops. \n \n5.  The participants will learn through the analyses they carry out together. Thus, they will \nstart to build capacity to work together to implement policy changes that they had a role in \nproposing. This process will build social capital, as well as enhance institutional capacity for \npolicy development and implementation planning. \n \nB.

Thematic Studies: Realizing the Pacific\u2019s Potential \n \n6.  The Pacific Islands have a poor record of economic growth. Much of the region achieved \nsatisfactory  growth  in  the  post-independence  \u201choneymoon.\u201d  However,  growth  has  since \nweakened as most countries have faced periods of man-made fiscal or economic crisis. The \nregion is now generally seen to be performing below its potential.  \n \n7.  Comparisons with Asia highlight the marked gap in economic performance. The Asian \neconomy can be expected to double in size every 10\u201315 years. In the Pacific, low economic \ngrowth rates mean the region\u2019s economy will take 25\u201335 years to double in size. The Pacific \nIslands cannot expect to achieve the high growth rates of Asia. Natural disadvantages such as \nsmall population size, remoteness, and vulnerable environments mean lower growth potential \nfor  the  Pacific  Islands compared  with  Asia\u2019s.  But  the  successful  economies  of  the  Pacific \ndemonstrate that moderate growth rates are achievable. \n \n9.  The  region\u2019s  performance  problems  extend  beyond  economic  growth,  however. \nInternational comparisons point to a relatively slow rate of progress, or in some cases no \nprogress at all, in key social indicators. The region\u2019s development path is, on the whole, closer \nto that of sub-Saharan African than to that of Asia (see for example Table A4.1). \n \nTable A4.1: Progress toward the MDGs\u2014An International Comparison \nMDG Indicator 7b:  MDG Indicator 30: \nPrimary Completion  Population with  MDG Indicator 31: \nMDG Indicator 8:  Rate  Sustainable Access to  Population with \nYouth Literacy Rate  (% of students enrolled in  an Improved Water  Access to Improved \nof 15\u201324-Year Olds  the final grade of primary  Source   Sanitation  \n  (%)  school 1)  (% of population)  (% of population) \nItem  1990  2000/04a     1999  2004  1990  2004  1990  2004 \n                 \nWorld  84.3  87.2  82.8  86.1  78.0  83.0  49.0  59.0 \n  Developing Regions  80.9  85.0  80.4  84.4  71.0  80.0  35.0  50.0 \n     Oceaniab  73.5  72.8  64.2  64.4  51.0  51.0  54.0  53.0 \n     Sub-Saharan Africa  67.4  73.1  50.7  56.4  49.0  56.0  32.0  37.0 \n     Northern Africa  66.3  84.3  90.2  91.2  89.0  91.0  65.0  77.0 \n     Latin America and       92.7  96.0  96.2  98.3  83.0  91.0  68.0  77.0 \n     the Caribbean \n     East Asia  95.5  98.9  101.8  98.1  71.0  78.0  24.0  45.0 \n     South Asia  61.5  72.2  70.9  82.3  72.0  85.0  20.0  38.0 \n     Southeast Asia  94.3  96.2  88.2  95.3  76.0  82.0  49.0  67.0 \n     West Asia  80.1  91.3  78.9  81.6  85.0  91.0  81.0  84.0 \n     Commonwealth of   99.2  99.7  93.3  91.4  92.0  92.0  82.0  83.0 \n     Independent States ", "16     Appendix 4    \n \nMDG Indicator 7b:  MDG Indicator 30: \nPrimary Completion  Population with  MDG Indicator 31: \nMDG Indicator 8:  Rate  Sustainable Access to  Population with \nYouth Literacy Rate  (% of students enrolled in  an Improved Water  Access to Improved \nof 15\u201324-Year Olds  the final grade of primary  Source   Sanitation  \n  (%)  school 1)  (% of population)  (% of population) \nItem  1990  2000/04a  1999  2004  1990  2004  1990  2004 \n  Developed Regions  99.7  99.3  98.6  98.8  100.0  99.0  100.0  99.0 \n  Least-Developed   56.3  63.7  48.6  53.4         \n  Countries \n  Landlocked   65.0  70.3  55.3  60.6         \n  Developing Countries \n  Small Developing      84.8  85.3  73.3  75.1         \n  States \nMDG = Millennium Development Goal. \na  Data refer to the latest literacy estimates and projections released by the Institute for Statistics of the United Nations Educational, \n Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) for the reference period 2000\u20132004. \nb  The Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) compose about 90% of the population of the Oceania region.

Reflecting these observations, thematic studies with the broad theme \u201cRealizing the \nPacific\u2019s Potential\u201d are to be undertaken. The program of study is built on three subthemes: \n \n(i)  WHY  is  the  region  underperforming?  The  potential  key  contributors  to  the \nregion\u2019s weak performance would be identified, and the extent to which policy, \ninstitutional, and natural endowments are contributing to poor performance would \nbe assessed, to inform the discussion of priorities. The potential growth and \ndevelopment path under improved settings would then be mapped out. \n(ii)  WHAT changes in public policy are needed? A policy focus would be adopted, \nwith an emphasis on the actions needed to bring the region\u2019s actual economic \nand  development  performance  closer  to  the  potential.  Government  policies, \nincluding expenditure programs, suited to the region that would do most to lift \ngrowth and development would be identified. Established options for improving \nperformance would be reinforced and complemented by an investigation of new \nways of moving forward. \n(iii)  HOW can we help the region manage change? The factors that explain why the \nregion has been slow to change and take up the opportunities for economic \ngrowth  and  development  would  be  explored,  and  a  policy  response  to  the \nbarriers  that  prevent  community  aspirations  from  being  realized  would  be \nidentified and developed.
