I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Kazakhstan for the CAREC Corridor 3 (Shymkent\u2013Tashkent Section) [Link to \nthe Western Europe-Western People\u2019s Republic of China International Transit Corridor] Road \nImprovement Project.1 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The project will rehabilitate a 37-kilometer (km) section of the Shymkent\u2013Tashkent road, \na main transport artery in south Kazakhstan and a section of Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridor 3.2 The project road also connects with CAREC Corridor 1 \nlinking eastern Europe with the western People\u2019s Republic of China. In parallel with Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development \n(EBRD) will fund the rehabilitation of the remaining 62 km of the Shymkent\u2013Tashkent road and \nprovide institutional development assistance.  \n3.  The rationale for the project emanates from (i) economic and social performance in \nsouth Kazakhstan, which is below the country\u2019s average; (ii) the regional significance of the \nproject road at the junction of two CAREC corridors; and (iii) the dilapidated physical condition \nof the project road, which impedes transport, efforts to diversify South Kazakhstan\u2019s economy, \nand regional integration. \n4.  Since 2009, Kazakhstan has experienced strong economic growth driven mainly by a \nsubstantial increase in oil production, prevailing high commodity prices, and an influx of direct \nforeign investment. However, the positive macroeconomic development has masked growing \ndisparities across regions. South Kazakhstan is among the provinces that have not benefited \nproportionately from the favorable macroeconomic development (para. 20). It has limited good \nroads and inadequate public transport services. As a result, a majority of local people have \ndifficulty in reaching the administrative centers of the province, markets, and social services. \n5.  The  government  of  Kazakhstan  has  adopted  the  2020  Strategy  for  Economic \nDevelopment and the State Program on Accelerated Industrial-Innovative Development (SPAID) \nto diversify the economy and promote balanced regional development.3 To this end, Shymkent, \nSouth Kazakhstan\u2019s capital, with a population of about 0.6 million in 2011, is designated a \nnational  growth  center.  To  support the  2020 Strategy  for  Economic Development  and  the \nSPAID, the government has reformulated and expanded its road development plan into the \nTransport Sector Program (TSP) for 2010\u20132014.4 The TSP aims to develop a transport system \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the ADB-financed portion of the project is in Appendix 1. ADB provided \nproject preparatory small-scale technical assistance to conduct due diligence and prepare the project. Unless \notherwise specified, the \u201cproject\u201d used in this report and recommendation of the president refers to the project to be \nfinanced by ADB. \n2  The CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy and its Implementation Action Plan identify six CAREC \ncorridors. The CAREC Ministerial Conference endorsed the Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy in 2007 and \nthe Implementation Action Plan in 2008. Corridor 3 links the Russian Federation with the Middle East and South \nAsia, connecting Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n3  http://www.inform.kz/eng/article/2437463. \n4  Government of Kazakhstan. 2010.

Improving the Shymkent\u2013Tashkent \nroad  will  complement  the  government\u2019s  regional  development  activities  and  contribute  to \nachieving the objectives of the SPAID and TSP in Kazakhstan. The project also aligns with \nADB's  Strategy  20205 and  its  Country  Partnership  Strategy  2012\u20132016,  which  identifies \ntransport infrastructure as a core area of ADB operations.6 \n \n6.  Kazakhstan\u2019s geographic location and economic structure make the country\u2019s economy \nhighly freight intensive, affecting its trade competitiveness. Kazakhstan has an approximately \n93,600 km road network, which includes 23,495 km of republican (national and international) \nroads; the remainder is rural and urban roads. Road freight traffic has increased in recent years. \nRoads accounted for 25% of the country\u2019s freight traffic by ton-km and 85% of its passenger \ntraffic by passenger-km in 2009. These shares are likely to continue to grow. However, a major \nshare of the republican road network is in a poor state of repair with about 50% requiring \nrehabilitation.  Cross-border  impediments,  coupled  with  deteriorated  road  infrastructure,  are \nimpeding trade flows.  \n7.  The government\u2019s strategic goals in the transport sector are to establish an efficient and \nsustainable transport system in Kazakhstan through policy reforms, sector restructuring, and \ninfrastructure development. The government has made policy changes to improve cost recovery, \nincrease competition, strengthen management of operations and maintenance, and encourage \npublic\u2013private partnerships. The government has also made significant investments on transport \ninfrastructure through external borrowing and budgetary allocation. The safeguard policies of \nboth  ADB  and  Kazakhstan  are  being  adhered  to  ensure  that  (i)  negative  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are minimized, and (ii) adverse impacts are adequately mitigated. \n8.  In line with ADB\u2019s country strategy for Kazakhstan and the government\u2019s transport sector \nstrategy, ADB operations in the transport sector support policy reforms, sector restructuring, \ninfrastructure improvement, and capacity development. ADB\u2019s experience in the transport sector \nhas been positive, with all ongoing ADB-assisted road projects expected to be completed on \ntime. The key lessons learned from ADB\u2019s past experience include the needs of (i) close project \nsupervision to ensure smooth implementation, (ii) enhanced monitoring of environmental and \nsocial safeguards compliance, and (iii) continued support for capacity development for the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. These lessons have been incorporated in the design of \nthe project. \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  project\u2019s  impact  will  be  closer  regional  cooperation  and  increased  trade  along \nCAREC 3. The outcome will be an efficient transport network in the South Kazakhstan section \nof CAREC Corridor 3. \n \nC.  Output \n \n10.  The output of the project will be a 37 km (km 705 to km 742) rehabilitated road section \nfrom Shymkent toward Tashkent. \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

The financing plan for the projects to be financed by ADB and EBRD is in Table 2.  \nThe government has requested a loan of $125 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp finance the ADB-financed project. The loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 4 years, repayment by straight-line method, an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  \na commitment charge of 0.15% per year,8 and such other terms and conditions set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement. Based on this, the average loan maturity is 12.25 years; and no maturity \npremium is payable to ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its \ndecision  to  borrow  under  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount   Share \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nThe Project [Shymkent\u2013Tashkent Section (km 705 to km 742)]     \nAsian Development Bank  125.0  85.0 \nGovernment of Kazakhstan  22.0  15.0 \n     Subtotal  147.0  100.0 \nEBRD Financed Project [Shymkent\u2013Tashkent Section (km 742 to km 804)] \nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development  196.5   \nGovernment of Kazakhstan  27.7   \n     Subtotal   224.2   \nTotal  371.2   \nSources: Ministry of Transport and Communications, Government of Kazakhstan; and the Asian Development \nBank estimates. \n                                                \n7  Through a letter to ADB in April 2012, EBRD stated its intent to provide parallel financing and collaborate on \nimplementation arrangements. \n8  Interest and other charges during construction will not be capitalized in the loan and will be financed by the \ngovernment from its own resources. \n ", "4 \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) will be the executing agency. \nThe South Kazakhstan Committee of Roads (COR) under MOTC will be the implementing \nagency with direct responsibility for overall project implementation. The project management \nunit (PMU) within COR will manage this project.9 While the PMU has a few experienced staff \nmembers, a construction supervision consulting firm will be engaged to assist the PMU in \nmanaging daily project implementation activities.10 The construction supervision firm will provide \nsupport in safeguards compliance, and contract supervision. 11 Therefore, the PMU will have \nsufficient resources to supervise the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the project administration manual (PAM).12 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2015 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2016 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Transport and Communications \n(iii) Key implementing  South Kazakhstan Committee of Roads \nagencies \n(iv) Implementation unit  PMU  Staff of 10 \nProcurement  ICB  1 contract  $130.5 million \nConsulting services  QCBS  1 contract for construction  $3.5 million \n(90:10)  supervision with 222 person-  \n  months (47 international, 175   \n  national)   \n  1 contract for external safeguard   \nLCS  monitoring for 3 person-months  $10,000 \nAdvance contracting  Civil works and supervision consulting firm. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's  \nLoan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time) \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon between the Government of \nKazakhstan and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICB = international competitive bidding, LCS = least-cost selection, PMU = project \nmanagement unit, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n14.  The project road is located in south Kazakhstan. The climate of the province is marked \nby cold winters with heavy snowfall, hot summers with temperatures rising to 45\u00b0C, and an \naverage annual rainfall of 951 millimeters. The project road was built around 1970 and was not \ndesigned for the traffic loads that the road has carried over the last two decades. The advent of \n                                                \n9  The PMU is composed of technical, financial management, and administration staff. \n10 The civil works under the EBRD-financed project will be supervised by a separately recruited construction \nsupervision consultant.  \n11 A consultant engaged under the ADB-financed project preparatory technical assistance will provide procurement \nsupport. \n12 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nheavy trucks, not common at the time the road was designed, has been damaging to the \nstructure of the pavement. The road has not undergone major rehabilitation or reconstruction \nworks. As a result, about 70% of the pavement is in a less-than-satisfactory condition with major \nstructural problems, such as cracking, raveling, and potholes indicating the urgent need for \nreconstruction. \n \n15.  A 4-lane project road will accommodate the projected traffic volume.  The designed \nformation width of the road is 27.5 meters. The proposed pavement design is cement-concrete, \nwhich  requires  a much  smaller  operation  and  maintenance  budget  compared  with  asphalt \npavement. Concrete pavement also provides better rider quality, which saves fuel cost for road \nusers. In addition, concrete roads are safer as night time visibility is greater and require less \nstreet  lighting.  The  government  plans  to  install  weighbridges  under  the  project,  which  will \nenhance control of vehicle overloading and thus will serve as preventive maintenance. ADB \nconducted due diligence on the design and suggested improving the design of U turns to ensure \nsafe and smooth traffic flow. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n16.  The project will contribute to achieving the envisaged benefits of the improved transport \ncorridor:  lower  transport  costs,  shorter  travel  time,  and  improved  road  safety  standards.  \nThe  economic  evaluation  of  the  project  was  undertaken  using  ADB's  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects13 and  following  the  analytical  framework  of  the  highway \ndevelopment  and  management  model. 14 The  traffic  forecast  is  based  on  traffic  counts \nconducted on the project road in early 2012. Using the 2012 average daily traffic volume, annual \nnormal traffic growth is forecast at 3% for 2016\u20132035. Generated traffic, estimated at about 20% \nof normal traffic, is included in the analysis. Project costs and benefits are calculated based on a \ncomparison of with- and without-project scenarios. The economic costs are (i) capital, including \nphysical  contingencies  but  excluding  taxes;  and  (ii)  operation  and  maintenance,  including \nreplacement  of  depreciated  equipment.  The  economic  benefits  are  (i)  savings  in  vehicle \noperating costs resulting from the improved project road, and (ii) time savings. The results of the \neconomic analysis show that the project is economically feasible with an estimated economic \ninternal rate of return of 15.9%. Sensitivity tests confirm that the project would remain feasible \nshould the envisaged project costs increase or benefits be reduced. No financial analysis was \nundertaken because the project road will not generate revenues. \n17.  The fiscal impact of the project road is considered insignificant given the relatively short \nlength of the project road and the projected robust fiscal position of the government in the \nforeseeable  future.  In  addition,  the  government  has  consistently  increased  the  budgetary \nallocations for road maintenance so that the service quality of the entire road network has \nimproved. Moreover, the proposed cement concrete pavement for the project road will reduce \nmaintenance cost. \n \nC.  Governance \n18.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  MOTC.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM. The capacity of MOTC and COR regarding \nfinancial management and procurement were assessed and found to be lacking in some areas. \nThe consultant engaged under the ADB-financed project preparatory technical assistance will \n                                                \n13 ADB. 1997.

MOTC will also provide additional financial resources to COR \nto ensure full compliance with these policies and procedures. \n19.  All bidding documents for the civil works contract will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s \nright to audit all project records and accounts, as well as those of all contractors, suppliers, and \nother service providers as they relate to the project. Key measures to ensure proper governance \nare (i) independent external auditing of contracts, project accounts, and financial statements;15 \n(ii) transparent  decision  processes  for  all  procurement  matters;  and  (iii)  verification  of \ncontractors\u2019 payment claims by the supervision consultant and oversight by the PMU. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n20.  Kazakhstan\u2019s economic development in recent years has masked growing disparities \nacross regions. While poverty rates have declined in the country, the decrease of poverty rates \ncross regions varies. South Kazakhstan is among the country\u2019s poorer provinces with a poverty \nrate of 11.5% in 2011, which is the second highest in the country and significantly above the \nnational average of 6.5%.16 South Kazakhstan is dominated by agriculture. The main economic \nactivities in the project area are agriculture, specifically livestock and poultry. The project is \nexpected to contribute to poverty reduction in the province by increasing the transport of goods \nand improving people\u2019s access to services and markets. The project will also benefit local \nresidents and enterprises by creating jobs during construction and cutting transport costs. Social \nand poverty assessments were conducted and are included in the summary poverty reduction \nand social strategy.17 The project is classified as a general intervention, with no direct poverty \nreduction component. However, it will benefit poor people in the project area by improving their \naccess to markets and social services. \n \n21.  The  civil  works  contract  will  require  that  contractors  (i)  comply  with  Kazakhstan\u2019s \napplicable labor laws; (ii) not differentiate payment between men and women for work of equal \nvalue; (iii) not employ child labor in construction and maintenance activities; (iv) to the extent \npossible,  maximize  employment  of  local  poor  and  disadvantaged  residents  for  project \nconstruction, provided that the requirements for job and efficiency are adequately met; and  \n(v) encourage employment of women laborers. In addition, MOTC will ensure that information \non  the  risks  of  sexually  transmitted  diseases,  including  HIV/AIDS,  is  disseminated  to  the \nemployees of the works contractors under the project and members of local communities in the \nproject area. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n1.  Environment \n \n22.  The  ADB-financed  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared and disclosed in July 2012, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009). The major potential environmental impacts of the project \ninclude  (i)  air  and  water  pollution;  (ii)  noise  impacts;  (iii)  soil  erosion;  (iv)  generation  of \nconstruction and domestic waste; (v) occupational health and safety; (vi) cutting of trees; and \n(viii)  disruptions  and  utilities  relocation,  occurring  mainly  during  construction.  Adequate \n                                                \n15 The government finances all independent financial auditing required by international financial institutions through a \ncentralized budget. \n16 United Nations Development Programme and ADB. 2012.

The environmental management plan stipulates that capacity development \nbe provided for MOTC through training workshops before and during construction. \n23.  The construction supervision consultants will help manage the project\u2019s environmental \nimpacts and develop the PMU\u2019s capacity. The project complies with public disclosure and \nconsultation  requirements.  EBRD-financed  project  (km  742\u2013km  804)  is  classified  as  B  for \nenvironment.18  \n \n2.  Involuntary Resettlement \n \n24.  The  ADB-financed  project  is  classified  as  category  C  for  involuntary  resettlement.  \nDue diligence conducted for the ADB-financed project confirms that civil works will not cause \nany land acquisition or resettlement impacts, as all works will be undertaken within the existing \nright-of-way and no structures are located within the corridor of impact. In accordance with \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement, a land acquisition and resettlement framework (LARF) was \nprepared. The LARF provides an entitlement matrix for possible impacts and the institutional \narrangements for implementation and supervision, monitoring, and grievance redress. It will be \nused  if  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  issues  arise  due  to  design  changes  or \nunanticipated impacts during project implementation. MOTC shall report to ADB any LAR issues \nidentified upon full completion or update of the final design or during implementation, and obtain \nADB\u2019s prior approval before execution. In sections with pending LAR issues, no civil works will \nbe allowed to commence.
