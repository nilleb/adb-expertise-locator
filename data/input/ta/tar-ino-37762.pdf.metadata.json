The Government of Indonesia (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for advisory technical assistance (TA) for the preparation of a marine and fisheries sector \nstrategy.  A  TA  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Indonesia  in  November  2004  to  prepare  the \nproposed TA and to discuss the project concept with representatives of Government agencies. \nThe  Mission  reached  understandings  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives,  scope  and \ncomponents, cost estimates and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for consultants for the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 country assistance \nprogram for Indonesia.1 The TA framework is given in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.   Indonesia is a highly diverse archipelago of more than 17,000 islands with a land area of \nabout two million square kilometers (sq km) and a coastline of 81,000 km, the second longest in \nthe world. Indonesia is the largest archipelagic country in the world, richly endowed with vast \nmarine  and  fisheries  resources.  Its  renewable  resources  include  resources  such  as  fish, \nshrimps, molluscs, crustaceans, seaweeds, coral reefs, mangrove swamps, and other marine \nfauna and flora. Its non-renewable resources consist of oil and gas; a variety of minerals such \nas bauxite, tin, iron ore, white metal, and phosphorus; non-conventional ocean thermal energy; \nand sunken archaeological treasures. In the mining and mineral sectors, it is estimated that \nabout 70% of the country\u2019s oil and gas potential lies in the sea basin. The marine and fisheries \nsector2 also includes tourism, navigation, shipping, and transportation services. \n \n3.  The marine and fisheries sector plays a major role in the national economy. The gross \nvalue of Indonesia\u2019s marine and fisheries output was estimated at $5.2 billion in 2002, or about \n3% of that of the entire economy.3 Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest marine and fish producer and \nthe tenth largest fish exporter. Export revenues from fisheries reached about $1.75 billion in \n2002. However, Indonesia ranked 39th in the world in terms of average net foreign trade surplus \nin fisheries which totaled about $1.6 billion per year during 1994-2002. \n \n4.  Fish products are staples in the diet of Indonesians from virtually every income group, \nethnic origin, and geographic area, providing about two-thirds of the total domestic animal \nprotein supply. Fish is the principal source of animal protein for poor people. Although fish is \npopular,  per  capita  consumption  is  about  18%  lower  than  the  per  capita  animal  protein \nrequirement of 26.55 kg/yr recommended by the Food and Nutrition Study.4 \n \n5.  The marine and fisheries sector is an important source of employment, providing jobs to \nan estimated six million people engaged in capture fisheries and aquaculture. In addition, \nseveral hundreds of thousands are employed in fisheries and related enterprises. Fisheries and \naquaculture have been able to absorb the portion of the growing labor force which enters the \nemployment market each year as it is has been the occupation of last resort for many people \nwho are not able to find gainful employment.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 19 November 2004. \n2  Based on the current institutional set-up, mandate and functions of Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, the \nsector description and strategy development will mainly focus on the issues of development of marine renewable \nresources, marine environmental conservation and protection, and fisheries.    \n3  Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. 2003. Annual Report of the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries for the \nYear 2002. Jakarta, Indonesia. \n4  See footnote 3. \n ", "2  \n6.  Despite the country\u2019s reputation as a producer of quality marine and fisheries products, \namong others, the sector is faced with numerous problems hampering growth and development. \nThese constraints include: (i) degradation of marine habitats, pollution, and illegal and over-\nharvesting; (ii) poverty among coastal, small island, and remote inland communities and lack of \naccess to basic social services and infrastructure;  (iii) low productivity of small-scale fishers and \nfish-farmers, (iv) poor quality of fish and fish products and harvest losses, for the domestic and \nexport markets, (iv) inadequate fisheries information and extension system, (v) lack of credit \nassistance for improved fisheries production, processing, and marketing; and (vi) policy and \ninstitutional  issues  such  as  weaknesses  in  policy  implementation,  regulation,  and  law \nenforcement coupled with institutional inadequacies at the national and local level. \n \n7.  The Government created the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) in 1999 to \naddress the sector problems in a comprehensive manner. MMAF prepared a strategic plan for \n2001-2004, which provides the strategic framework for marine and fisheries policy, planning, \nand programming for sustainable management and utilization of marine and fisheries resources. \nHowever, the government strategies in the marine and fisheries sector mainly focused on \nincreasing fisheries and aquaculture production and improving fisheries infrastructures with \nlimited attention to the strategy on marine and fisheries resource management, environmental \nconservation  and  social  development.  Indonesia  has  not  formulated  a  comprehensive  or \nsystematic operational and development strategy for the marine and fisheries sector. \n \n8.  The Government has decentralized resource management and financing to the regions \nand promoted sustainable use of marine and fisheries resources and environmental protection. \nThe Government plans to widen the role and scope of decentralized marine and fisheries \nresource  management  and  social  development  to  address  the  emerging  challenges  and \nopportunities. Also, the marine and aquatic products have become very important commodities \nin international trade, providing opportunities for Indonesians to increase production value and \naccess to international market. The Government believes that a comprehensive strategy and \nsystematic approach will enable the country to use its comparative advantage, and guide the \nGovernment and other actors, including private sector to intervene in the sector appropriately. \n  \n9.   ADB  is  a  leading  financing  institution  in  Indonesian\u2019s  marine  and  fisheries  sector. \nThrough the years, ADB has actively supported the country\u2019s marine and fisheries development \nthrough investments, sector studies and policy formulation. ADB\u2019s operations in the sector have \ncovered  almost  all  aspects  of  marine  and  fisheries  sector,  including  marine  resource \nmanagement, fisheries, poverty reduction and biodiversity conservation. In the last 5 years, the \nMMAF have been implementing five major ADB marine resource and fisheries development \nprojects.5 A pipeline of investment and TA projects for 2005\u20132007 will further deepen ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in the sector.   \n \n10.   Lessons learned from previous programs indicated the need for: (i) taking a longer \nhorizon in planning process of marine and fisheries development and poverty reduction; (ii) a \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1992.

To respond to the needs of the marine and fisheries sector, a new \nand comprehensive sector strategy and an integrated action plan are required to systematically \naddress sector issues in relation to resource management, environmental degradation and \nsocial development. The TA will assist in preparing such a sector strategy, taking a holistic view \nof opportunities and constraints, and balancing the requirements of increasing production and \nsustainable resource management for the long term. The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s fisheries \npolicy in supporting developing member countries (DMCs) in preparing a medium- and long- \nterm operational strategy that focuses on poverty reduction, marine and fisheries resource \nconservation, and sustainable development including environmental protection. \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The purpose of the TA is to formulate and disseminate a medium-term marine and \nfisheries sector strategy to support the Government in developing policy, institutional reforms \nand investments to promote sustainable and pro-poor marine and fisheries development and \nresource  management.  The  TA  outputs  will  be  (i)  a  review  of  the  present  status  and \ndevelopment potential of Indonesia\u2019s marine and fisheries sector; (ii) a review of sector policies \nand institutions and their relevance to sector development; and (iii) a medium term strategy for \nthe  sustainable  development  and  management  of  the  sector,  including  identification  of \ninvestment constraints and opportunities in the sector.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The range of sector opportunities to be tapped and constraints to be overcome require a \nsector-wide approach, coupled with sub-sector- and area-specific strategies and interventions, \nfor implementation over the medium to long term. The policies and strategies will be based on \nan in-depth study and evaluation of present conditions and projected changes in the regional, \nnational and international settings. The TA will cover the following main areas: (i) a sector \noverview; (ii) sector policies and institutions; (iii) marine resources, fisheries and aquaculture \nresources, production, utilization, and management; (iv) fisheries support infrastructure facilities \nand services, including research, training and extension, credit, and marketing; (v) environment \nand fish health management; and (vi) social development and economics.  \n \n13.  The TA will involve a comprehensive review and analysis of sector resources, plans and \nprograms, and key institutions. It will also help delineate the role of the Government and private \nsector and draw conclusion on sector issues and lessons learned. The TA will then formulate a \n10-year sector strategy that will include key areas in policy reform, institutional strengthening, \nmarine  resource  management,  capture  and  culture  fisheries,  processing  and  value-adding \nenterprises,  support  services,  environmental  protection  and  pollution  control,  marine \nbiotechnology  development,  research  and  development,  and  eco-tourism  among  others.  6  \n                                                 \n6  Some externally funded studies have been undertaken for MMAF in the recent past, with a limited scope. In 2001, \na fisheries policy study was undertaken with funding from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and in \n2002, a World Bank approved a grant from its Institutional Development Fund for the \u201cInstitutional Development of \nMMAF.\u201d However, due to funding limitations, the study focused on the institutional assessment and capacity \nbuilding in Jakarta. \n ", "4  \nThe formulation of policy and strategy will refer to: (i) international declarations/ agreements, \nsuch  as  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  and  the  Convention  on  Biological \nDiversity; (ii) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and its implementation guidelines; and \n(iii) a regionalized Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and various regional agreements \nthat affect the marine and fisheries sector. The TA will also determine the financial requirement \nto implement the proposed strategy and investment program and identify possible sources of \nfunding from internal and external sources.  \n \n14.  The TA will be conducted in two phases over an 8-month period. The first phase (4 \nmonths) will involve policy, strategy, program and institutional review and analysis. Second \nphase  (4  months)  will  involve  formulating  appropriate  recommendations  for  policy  and \ninstitutional reform, strategies for the medium to long term, and a list of identified investment \nconstraints and opportunities for the next 10 years. The TA will be conducted in a participatory \nmanner  and  will  involve  extensive  consultations  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  at  the \nnational, regional, and local levels through national and regional workshops and local-level \nfocus group discussions. The extensive consultation will include the multi-lateral and bilateral \nfinancing agencies and donors7 that have contributed to the country\u2019s marine and fisheries \nsector development. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,180,000 equivalent, comprising $590,000 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $590,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide \n$880,000 equivalent on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program covering the entire foreign \nexchange  cost  of  $590,000  and  $290,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of the local currency cost of $300,000 equivalent to \ncover  local  travel,  surveys,  and  expenses  for  office  and  counterpart  staff.  Details  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The MMAF\u2019s secretariat general will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA, and as \nsuch  will  be  responsible  for  overall  TA  administration  and  implementation.  Interagency \ncoordination  will  be  ensured  by  a  TA  steering  committee  chaired  by  the  MMAF  secretary \ngeneral that will meet periodically to review TA progress and provide guidance and feedback to \nthe  consultants.  The  committee  will  include  representatives  of  the  National  Development \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Finance (MOF), MMAF\u2019s five directorates generals \nand other agencies, as well as ministries of environment, forestry, home affairs and tourism.  \n \n17.  The TA will be carried out by a team of international (about 21.5 person-months) and \ndomestic consultants (about 39 person-months). 8 The expertise will include (i) marine and \nfisheries policy and institutional development; (ii) marine and fisheries laws; (iii) marine and \nresources and fisheries; (iv) aquaculture and inland fisheries; (v) marine and aquatic products \n                                                 \n7  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  Danish  International  Development  Assistance,  Department  for \nInternational Development, Food and Agriculture Organization, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency,  World  Bank,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  Nations \nEnvironment Programme and United States Agency for International Development.   \n8  The World Fish Center, which is one of the centers under the Consultative Group for International Agriculture \nResearch (CGIAR), is expected to be involved in facilitating the TA study through providing professional inputs and \norganizing a research priority-setting workshop jointly with MMAF\u2019s Agency for Marine and Fisheries Research \n(BRKP).  \n ", "  5\nprocessing and marketing; (vi) research, training, and extension; (vii) monitoring, control, and \nsurveillance  (MCS);  (viii)  fisheries  infrastructure;  (ix)  social/community  development;  (x) \nenvironment/fish  health  management;  (xi)  economics,  finance,  and  credit;  (xii) \ninformation/database management; and (xiii) advocacy/social marketing. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB through a firm using quality and cost-based selection (QCBS) in accordance \nwith  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  (TOR)  for  the \nconsultants are given in Appendix 3. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n18.  The Government will establish a project coordination unit (PCU) in Bureau of Planning \nand International Cooperation (BPIC) under the MMAF secretariat general and assign a fulltime \nproject coordinator responsible for day-to-day project supervision and coordination with project \nconsultants and other concerned agencies. The Government will provide adequate counterpart \nstaff to work with the team of consultants as well as logistical and other administrative support \nservices, including office space and facilities to support the TA implementation. The counterpart \nstaff  will  be  drawn  from  the  BPIC  and  the  MMAF\u2019s  five  directorates  generals  and  other \nagencies, and will work closely with the consultants in the review and analysis of sector policies \nand institutions status, analysis of key sector issues in their respective areas, and formulation of \nstrategies  for  sector  development,  including  identification  of  investment  opportunities  and \nestimate funding requirement for sector growth.   \n \n19.  A participatory process approach will be followed in implementing the TA, involving \nextensive consultation with a wide range of stakeholders at the national, regional, and local \nlevels, particularly the local governments, private sector and nongovernment organizations, to \nensure that their views and inputs are considered in the formulation of the marine and fisheries \nsector strategy. This will be achieved through a series of national and regional workshops at \ninception, midterm and final stage of the TA. International institutions and external funding \nagencies active in the sector will also be invited to participate in the strategy formulation. \n \n20.  The TA is envisaged to commence in April 2005, with completion expected in November \n2005. Milestones include (i) preparation of detailed work program; (ii) sector review and field \nsurveys; (iii) data analysis; and (iv) formulation of sector strategy. The consultants will prepare \nthe following reports: (i) inception report within three weeks of commencing services; (ii) interim \nreport at the end of the third month, giving a detailed assessment of sector needs and broad \ndevelopment strategies; (iii) draft final report at the end of the seventh month; and (iv) final \nreport within three weeks from receipt of comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.
