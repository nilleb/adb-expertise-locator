THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of Fiji for the Transport Infrastructure Investment Sector Project. The report also \ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening  Transport  Coordination \nCapacity, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, approve the TA.1 \n \n2.  The proposed project will improve access to socioeconomic opportunities by supporting \nthe government in upgrading and rehabilitating land and maritime transport infrastructure.2 If \napproved,  the  project  will  be  the  first  under  full  reengagement,  following  Fiji\u2019s  successful \ndemocratic elections in 2014. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Fiji is a South Pacific archipelagic nation of 110 inhabited islands with a land area of \n18,300 square kilometers and a population of 860,000. Fiji is located 2,000\u20133,000 kilometers \n(km) from major metropolitan markets, and service delivery costs within the country are high \nbecause the population is dispersed. About 90% of the population lives on the three main \nislands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Taveuni. \n \n4.  Fiji  requires  adequate  transport  infrastructure  to  improve  access  to  economic \nopportunities and services for rural populations, and to improve trade. Fiji is a middle-income \ncountry with a per capita income of $4,618, and overall poverty in Fiji declined slightly between \n2003 (39.8%) and 2009 (35.2%). However, a 2008 household income and expenditure survey \nestimated the poverty incidence to be 19% in urban areas and 43% in rural areas. More than \nhalf  of  Fiji\u2019s  population  live  in  rural  communities,  which  are  geographically  isolated  from \nprovincial  and  national  centers  and  served  by  rural transport  infrastructure that  is  in  poor \ncondition.  These  factors  limit  rural  economic  opportunities  and  social  services.  The World \nBank\u2019s 2014 Doing Business report ranked Fiji 111th out of 185 economies in the ease of \ntrading across borders, which is a measure of the time and cost associated with the import or \nexport of a standard shipment by sea transport.3 Local transportation and handling accounted \nfor 30% of costs, and about 16% of time, associated with imports and exports. \n \n5.  The road network is characterized by spine or circumferential main roads and feeder \nroads, with few alternative routes. It is prone to disruption by heavy rainfall and flooding, which \nis often exacerbated by tropical cyclones. Rural maritime infrastructure has been neglected and \nis in poor condition. Climate change predictions show increased frequency and intensity of \nheavy rainfall, and sea level rise.4 Roads, bridges, and rural jetties need to be rehabilitated, with \nbetter environmental protection and to higher construction standards, to be resilient against \nextreme weather events and natural disasters. Disruption in transport connectivity constrains \nmovement  of  people  and  goods,  depresses  productive  rural  activity,  and  impedes tourism \ngrowth. Further investment in the transport sector, focusing on vulnerable groups\u2014including \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory support through policy and advisory TA: ADB. \n2013.

", "2   \nrural communities, women, elderly, and youth\u2014and considering climate resilience, will provide a \nfoundation for inclusive growth by improving access to markets and services in rural areas. \n \n6.  Intermodal links are vital to link Fiji\u2019s dispersed communities, and enable people and \ngoods to connect through road links to the main ports of Suva (the capital) and Lautoka, and to \nthe landing ports for interisland domestic shipping and ferry services between Viti Levu, Vanua \nLevu, Ovalau, and Taveuni. Freight is transported between northwest and southeast Viti Levu \neither via ship (between ports in Lautoka and Suva), or by land along Queens Road. The \ninternational airport in Nadi is connected to the capital by the Queens Road and by domestic \nflights to and from Nausori airport. Roads to these airports are essential intermodal links. \n \n7.  The government has estimated that about F$1.3 billion ($702 million equivalent) in \ncapital expenditures and F$450 million ($243 million equivalent) in maintenance expenditures \nare required for road and rural maritime infrastructure over 2014\u20132018.5 This is more than \ndouble the annual average maintenance expenditures and triple the capital works expenditures \nover 2004\u20132013. These budget increases will require contributions from concessional financing \ndedicated to the sector, in addition to government support from general revenue sources. \n \n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has previously advocated for the establishment of \na roads authority; this was realized through the establishment of the Fiji Roads Authority (FRA) \nby the Fiji Roads Authority Decree 2012, and has contributed to more efficient service delivery. \nThe FRA is responsible for maintaining and upgrading assets that currently consist of about \n11,115 km of roads (including 1,483 km of sealed and 9,632 km of unsealed roads), 868 bridges, \nand 47 jetties. While FRA currently operates under a costly institutional setup that relies on \nforeign expertise, it has developed a strategy to increase local capacity;6 the project will support \nthese efforts by engaging local experts, guided and mentored by FRA\u2019s international experts, for \nday-to-day project supervision. It will also build the capacity of government staff to plan, select, \nand oversee implementation of transport infrastructure projects. \n \n9.  ADB has provided transport-related support to Fiji since 1980, and investments have \ngenerally achieved key objectives, despite some delays and cost overruns. ADB continued \nimplementing transport projects during a period of limited engagement that began in 2006, \nincluding the Port Development Project, and the Third Road Upgrading Sector Project.7 In 2009, \nADB also approved additional financing for the Third Road Upgrading Sector Project, and an \nemergency  loan  to  assist  Fiji  in  response  to  devastating  floods.8 Lessons  from  previous \nengagements in the country relevant to the transport sector include the need for sustained \nsupport over the long term to foster private participation in infrastructure service delivery, and \nthe  importance  of  extensive  preparation  and  implementation  support  to  address  capacity \nconstraints.9  \n \n                                                \n5  Ministry of Finance National Budget 2014, and Fiji Roads Authority Asset Management Plan, 2013 (draft). \n6  Fiji Roads Authority. 2014.

The  government\u2019s  vision  for  Fiji  is  set  out  in  the  Roadmap  for  Democracy  and \nSustainable Socio-Economic Development, 2010\u20132014,10 and is reiterated through the Green \nGrowth Framework (GGF).11 The GGF sets out policy direction for 10 thematic areas, which \ninclude resilience to climate change and disasters, sustainable transportation, and inclusive \nsocial development. ADB engagement will be guided by its country partnership strategy, 2014\u2013\n2018, and country operations business plan, 2015\u20132017 for Fiji, both of which support the \ngovernment\u2019s national strategies, and identify transport as a key sector for engagement.12 The \nproject will support the country partnership strategy in swiftly increasing ADB support in the \ntransport  sector  following  Fiji\u2019s  2014  elections,  and  help  the  country  overcome  its  key \ndevelopment  challenges.  The  project  will  finance  repair,  rehabilitation,  and  upgrading  of \ntransport infrastructure prioritized by an updated 20-Year National Transport Infrastructure Plan, \nbased  on  the  GGF,  the  Roadmap  for  Democracy  and  Sustainable  Socio-Economic \nDevelopment, and Public Sector Investment Program.13 \n \n11.  The  project  will  be  implemented  as  a  sector  project,  by  financing  a  time  slice  of \nsubprojects (comprising 30 km of roads, 30 bridges, and four jetties) prioritized by the updated \n20-Year  National  Transport  Infrastructure  Plan,  and  selected  in  accordance  with  agreed \nsubproject eligibility criteria and selection procedures.14 The project will support strengthening of \nthe  institutional  capacity  of  central  and  line  agencies  in  prioritizing  transport  infrastructure \ninvestment, and reducing the backlog of maintenance of transport infrastructure. The project \nsupports  existing  policy  for  the  transport  sector  articulated  through  the  National  Transport \nSector Plan (1993), which is being updated through ADB-supported TA (footnote 2). \n \n12.  The  World  Bank  has  expressed  strong  interest  in  cofinancing  the  project,  and  is \nexpected to approve its cofinancing in early 2015; following that approval, the project scope will \nbe enlarged to cover additional subprojects. The World Bank cofinancing is envisaged to be on \na joint basis, with partial administration by ADB of the cofinancing. Common implementation \nframeworks covering safeguards, procurement, and financial management have been agreed in \nprinciple between ADB and the World Bank. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact of the project will be improved access to markets, employment opportunities, \nand social services. The outcome will be improved safety and resilience of land and maritime \ntransport infrastructure. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  The project will have two outputs: \n(i)  Rehabilitated  and  climate-resilient  land  and  maritime  transport \ninfrastructure.  The  project  will  finance  civil  works  to  repair,  rehabilitate, \nreconstruct, and upgrade existing roads, bridges, and rural jetties. It will also \nfinance safety improvements on selected roads and bridges, which may include \nroad safety furniture and streetlights, and gender-sensitive designs for improved \n                                                \n10 Ministry of National Planning. 2009.

The executing agency will be  the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the implementing \nagency will be FRA. The government will finance additional staff for FRA to establish the project \nsupervision team. The additional staff will consist of a project manager, an accountant, an \nenvironmental safeguards manager, and a social safeguards manager. FRA will be responsible \nfor subproject screening, feasibility studies, detailed design, procurement, and implementation. \nA project steering committee (chaired by MOF, and including FRA) will monitor project progress \nand provide guidance to the executing and implementing agencies. \n \n19.  To expedite implementation, advance procurement action and retroactive financing has \nbeen approved for (i) design and supervision consultants, who will be responsible for detailed \ndesign and construction supervision; and (ii) a civil works package that was confirmed by the \ngovernment in October 2014 during its annual budget cycle. The government has been advised \nthat approval by ADB of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \napprove and finance the project. \n \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2015\u2013June 2020 \nEstimated completion date  June 2020 (loan closing date: 31 December 2020) \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Project steering committee \nMinistry of Finance (chair) \nFiji Roads Authority (member) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n                                                \n16 The taxes and duties do not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, and will only be financed \nfor ADB-financed expenditures.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n21.  The TA for Strengthening Transport Coordination Capacity will be provided to develop \nand implement a capacity development plan for MOF and the Ministry of Infrastructure and \nTransport  to  enhance  staff  capacity  in  planning,  selecting,  and  overseeing  infrastructure \nprojects,  including those  implemented  by  FRA.  Expected  outputs  will  include  strengthened \nability  of  MOF  and  the  Ministry  of  Infrastructure  and  Transport  staff  to  review  subproject \nselection  and  feasibility  studies,  and  align  national  policy  objectives  with  sector-specific \nstrategies.  The  TA  will  build  capacity  of  government  staff  in  infrastructure  planning,  asset \nmanagement, economic analysis, and safeguards. \n \n22.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  administrative  support, \nlogistics, local transport, and other in-kind contribution. The value of government contribution is \nestimated to account for 12.5% of the total TA cost. ADB will engage an international consultant \nfor the TA in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time), using individual consultant selection. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  Subproject  selection  criteria  have  been  developed  and  are  contained  within  the \nsubproject eligibility criteria and selection procedure.18 Subprojects will be guided by priority \n                                                \n18 Subproject selection criteria and procedure are available in the Project Administration Manual (footnote 14). \n ", "7 \ninvestments in the 20-Year National Transport Infrastructure Plan. The project will support FRA \nin addressing the backlog of maintenance of the transport network by reducing the number of \nbridges and jetties rated high priority through appropriate repair, rehabilitation, or replacement \nmeasures.19 Climate change risk screening was undertaken and the project\u2019s climate change \nrisk was assessed as high. The engineering designs will consider increased rainfall resulting \nfrom projected climate change to enable for roads and bridges to withstand higher level floods, \nincreased scouring of abutments, and slope stability hazards. Engineering designs for jetties will \nconsider sea level rise. The project will prepare revised construction standards to incorporate \nclimate change adaptation considerations for more climate-resilient road and maritime transport \ninfrastructure,  and  to  reflect  current  international  standards  for  road  geometry,  pavement, \ndrainage, and associated structures. The revised standards will be piloted under the project. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n24.  An economic and financial analysis was carried out in accordance with ADB guidelines \nfor a sample subproject on Upper Sigatoka Valley Road: Narata Bridge and Matewale Crossing. \nThe analysis was undertaken by comparing the discounted costs and benefits under different \nscenarios during 2015\u20132044 in constant 2014 prices. Economic evaluation of bridges is most \noften carried out as part of a wider analysis of road improvement, as the bridge works contribute \nto the overall project benefits and costs. Evaluating the economics of individual bridge repairs, \nupgrading  or  replacement  requires  a  detailed  inspection  of  the  transport  service  function \nprovided by the bridge in question (or other forms of waterway crossing) and of the effects of \nrepair or replacement options.  \n \n25.  The  sample  subproject  demonstrated  significant  unquantified  benefits,  including  (i) \nimproved reliability for short-distance, nonmotorized traffic; (ii) improved safety for both vehicles \nand pedestrians of two-lane bridges with footpaths, as compared to narrow single-lane bridge \ndecks; (iii) improved reliability of bridges in the valley, which may induce additional agricultural \nproduction; and (iv) reduced upstream damming effects due to higher-level structures, thereby \nreducing costs of flood damage to crops and buildings adjacent to the river. For these reasons, \na threshold economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 10% was used. For Narata Bridge, the \nEIRR of the preferred option (replacing the existing single-lane bridge with a raised two-lane \nstructure  bridge)  is  11.1%.  In  the  case  of  the  Matewale  Crossing,  replacing  the  existing \ndeteriorated Irish crossing with a new Irish crossing was found to be the only economically \nviable option, with an EIRR of 38%. The results were tested under adverse scenarios to check \nsensitivity and were found to be robust. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB \nguidelines.20 The  financial  management  assessment  considered  FRA  in  its  role  as  the \nimplementing agency, and MOF in its role as the executing agency. Fiji has an effective and \nwell-functioning public services sector, supported by a developed private sector with available \nnational expertise in accounting and financial management. No major county level issues are \napparent. The financial management assessment confirms that FRA has sufficient financial \nmanagement arrangements to handle the project. Due to governance and accountability issues, \n                                                \n19 High priority refers to FRA\u2019s prioritization rating for a bridge or jetty\u2019s condition, which indicates deficiencies in its \nserviceability, including but are not limited to, its structural integrity, vulnerability to adverse weather events, and/or \nuser safety issues. \n20 ADB. 2005.

Manila.  \n ", "8   \nand the risk associated with the restoration of democracy, inherent risk was assessed as \nmoderate.  Control  risk  was  rated  as  medium.  Although  FRA  has  established  financial \nmanagement  procedures  and  accounting  and  reporting  systems,  as  well  as  access  to \nprofessional services to meet ADB\u2019s financial management requirements, there were major \nfindings from internal audits, and qualified audit opinions were issued by the external auditors. \n \n27.  FRA 2014 Operations Manual (footnote 6) defines accounting and financial management \nprocesses and procedures that require FRA to abide by the terms and conditions stipulated in \nevery loan agreement between ADB and the government. FRA is supported by KPMG for \nfinancial  and  internal  audit  services,  and  are  audited  annually  by  the  auditor  general. 21 \nCurrently,  the  accounts  department  does  not  have  the  main  responsibility  for  preparing \nwithdrawal applications. FRA may lack resources to meet the anticipated increased workload \nresulting from the project, and project management support and institutional strengthening will \nbe provided to ensure adequate financial management capacity within FRA. \n \n28.  A project procurement assessment was prepared in accordance with ADB guidelines.22 \nThe  Fiji  Road  Authority  Decree  2012  provides  that  the  provisions  of the  Fiji  Procurement \nRegulations 2010 shall not apply to FRA, and requires FRA to establish and implement its own \nprocurement process and plan and to ensure that all goods and services are procured in \naccordance with its plan. The plan is articulated in the FRA Operations Manual. The project \nprocurement risk is assessed as moderate. The FRA Operations Manual provides that all ADB-\nfinanced projects shall follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime) for the procurement of goods and works, and ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time) for the recruitment of consulting services. \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed with, the government and MOF. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 14). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  The primary project beneficiaries are (i) rural and village communities in the hinterland \nnear roads and bridges, (ii) coastal and island residents in remote areas, (iii) farmers producing \ncash crops, (iv) district and provincial traders, and (v) commercial industries such as tourism \nand the sugar industry. Benefits to rural communities and vulnerable groups include improved \nconnectivity to service hubs, access to agricultural markets, shorter travel times, improved \naccess to employment, and reduced accident rates. \n \n31.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. A gender action plan has \nbeen prepared to ensure that engineering designs address the needs of women for safe road \ntravel to access social services and markets. Selected bridge designs will include pedestrian \naccess with guard rails and footpaths. The project will encourage women\u2019s participation in labor-\nbased construction activities where culturally appropriate, provide equal pay for equal work \nbetween men and women, and ensure income restoration measures to assist those who have \nlost  assets  or  access  to  land.  Both  women  and  men  will  be  represented  in  community \nconsultations and decision-making committees where culturally appropriate, and awareness will \nbe raised to mitigate the potential spread of sexually transmitted infections and HIV during \nconstruction phases. \n                                                \n21 KPMG is a company that provides professional services for audit, tax, and advisory. \n22 ADB. 2014.

ADB and the World Bank have agreed on a common \napproach to safeguards based on Fiji\u2019s safeguards requirements, and strengthened by ADB\u2019s \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009) and World Bank safeguards policies. For the environment, \nthe project is classified as category B. Category A subprojects will not be eligible for financing \nunder the project. An environmental and social management framework has been prepared to \nensure that the project complies with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement and Fiji national laws.23  \nAn environmental impact assessment was prepared for the sample subproject.24 The subproject \nimpacts  are  site-specific,  largely  confined  to  the  construction stage,  and  can  be mitigated \nreadily. The project will be implemented by the project supervision team to be established in \nFRA, which will be supported by design and supervision consultants; the project supervision \nteam  and  the  supporting  consultants  will  include  safeguard  specialists  responsible  for \nimplementing the environmental and social management framework and monitoring compliance. \n \n33.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  B).  The project is classified as category B for \ninvoluntary resettlement. The project is not expected to involve any physical displacement. It will \nrequire acquisition of land for road widening or realignment, and temporary  access during \nconstruction; the impacts are not expected to be significant. A land acquisition and resettlement \nframework and a land acquisition and resettlement plan have been prepared for the project.25  \nConsultations have been undertaken during project preparation, and further consultations will be \nundertaken during implementation. The land acquisition and resettlement plan will be updated \nor finalized during detailed design, and compensation will be provided to affected persons \nbefore the start of civil works at the respective subproject sites. The project will establish a \ngrievance redress mechanism to resolve grievances of affected persons. FRA will (i) appoint a \nfocal  person  for  land  issues;  (ii)  establish  social  safeguard  capacity  within  the  project \nsupervision team, including social safeguard specialists; and (iii) coordinate with the iTaukei \nLand Trust Board and the Department of Lands to implement the project\u2019s land acquisition and \nresettlement activities. \n \n34.  Indigenous  peoples  (category  C). The project has been classified category C for \nindigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The project is not \nexpected to impact vulnerable group of indigenous people. The iTaukei (Melanesians) comprise \nthe  majority  of  the  country\u2019s  population  and  are  likely  the  majority  population  and  project \nbeneficiaries in the project areas. While a separate indigenous peoples plan is not required, the \nproject  will  be  implemented  in  a  participatory  manner.  FRA,  in  coordination  with  relevant \ngovernment agencies, will organize adequate consultations with the affected local communities \nand ensure that there is a broad local community support of the proposed subprojects. The \nproject\u2019s  stakeholder  consultation  strategy  and  participation  plan  will  include  detailed \nconsultation measures. The detailed feasibility reports will include a summary of consultation \nactivities and confirmation of the broad community support of the subproject. \n                                                \n23 The environmental and social management framework is equivalent to ADB\u2019s environmental assessment and \nreview  framework.
