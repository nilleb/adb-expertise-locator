THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Trade and Competitiveness Program and (ii) a proposed policy-\nbased  loan  to  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Pakistan  for  subprogram  1  of  the  Trade  and \nCompetitiveness Program. \n \n2.  The program will help Pakistan reduce its current account deficit, promote macroeconomic \nstability, and foster sustained high growth by improving trade competitiveness and exports. The \nprogram will (i) introduce important tariff and tax-related policy reforms to support Pakistan\u2019s \nexport industries and increase their competitiveness internationally; and (ii) strengthen key trade-\nfacilitating institutions such as accreditation bodies, the EXIM Bank of Pakistan (EXIMBP), and \nthe National Single Window (NSW). \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s exports averaged growth of more than 10% per year from FY2004 to FY2011, \npeaking at $25.4 billion in FY2011, and remained relatively flat from FY2011 to FY2015. Exports \nin almost all major export groups and destinations declined shortly thereafter, dropping to $22.0 \nbillion in FY2017. Pakistan\u2019s share of global exports also declined by 20%, from 0.3% in 2005 to \n0.1% in 2017. While exports recovered to $24.8 billion in FY2018, their rise-and-fall pattern during \nFY2004\u2013FY2017 reflects the underperformance of the country\u2019s export industries and the long-\nterm decline of trade competitiveness. In fact, Pakistan\u2019s export performance lags that of South \nAsian  and  Southeast  Asian  comparator  countries,  including  those  that  entered  key  export \nindustries such as textiles later than Pakistan. From 1990 to 2016, Pakistan averaged export \ngrowth of 5.6% per year, compared with 8.3% in Sri Lanka, 11.8% in Bangladesh, 26.7% in Viet \nNam, and 27.1% in Cambodia. Pakistan\u2019s ratio of exports to gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014\n8.2% in 2017\u2014is the lowest among its competitor countries and is lower than the 17.7% regional \naverage. Foreign direct investment in Pakistan, including its export industries, remained relatively \nlow at 0.92% of GDP in 2017, even as the government increased infrastructure spending.1 \n \n4.  The weakness of Pakistan\u2019s export trade is also reflective of its inability to diversify export \nproducts over the past few decades. Exports have been concentrated in less sophisticated and \nlower  value-added  products,  particularly  agricultural,  textile,  and  leather  products.  Textiles \naccounted for 56% of Pakistan\u2019s exports from FY2016 to FY2018, but while textile exports \naveraged annual growth of 7.1% during FY2004\u2013FY2011, the average dropped to just 0.2% \nduring FY2011\u2013FY2018 (Figure). Pakistan is also losing export competitiveness because of the \nhigh concentration of less sophisticated goods; high-tech products comprise less than 2% of total \nexports. More complex categories such as chemicals, plastics, machinery, and appliances have \nsmall export shares (0.7%\u20132.2%) and had low or negative export growth from FY2011 to FY2018. \nOne of the reasons for this is low and declining investment in Pakistan. Private investment as a \npercentage of GDP stood at about 10.0% from FY2014 to FY2018 and dipped to 9.8% in FY2019.2 \n \n5.  Trade performance impact on the current account. The current account deficit has \nwidened significantly as a result of its growing trade deficit, which puts pressure on the balance \nof payments. The current account deficit expanded to a new high of $20 billion (6.3% of GDP) in \n                                                \n1  World Bank. World Development Indicators (accessed 20 May 2019). \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Industry and Trade (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "2 \nFY2018 (Table 1). The trade deficit increased rapidly because of stagnant export growth and \nincreasing imports. Capital and consumer goods contributed to the rise in imports from FY2014 \nto FY2018. Private consumption accounted for 81% of GDP in FY2018, largely supported by \nimports. However, by value, the share of consumer goods (including consumer raw materials) in \ntotal imports declined from 69% in FY2014 to 57% in FY2018, while the share of capital goods \nand oil imports increased 10 percentage points to 40%. This can be partly attributed to more \npublic spending on infrastructure projects, and to the rise in oil prices. Finally, the rising budget \ndeficit also fed into the worsening current account deficit. \n \nFigure: Compound Annual Export Growth Rate \n(%) \n40\n35 FY2004 to FY2011\n30\nFY2011 to FY2018\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15 Vegetable Prepared Mineral Chemical or Plastics, Raw hide Textiles and Machinery,\nproducts foodstuffs products allied rubber skins, textile mechanical\nindustries articles leather, fur articles appliances\nskins,\narticles  \nFY = fiscal year. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan. \n \n6.  Pakistan's gross international reserves fell from $19.4 billion at the end of FY2016 to \n$11.3 billion at the end of FY2018 (Table 1), and to $9.1 billion at the end of 2018. Net reserves \ndeclined from $18.1 billion to $9.8 billion (1.9 months of import cover) during the same period. \nReserves declined because of the increasing current account deficit, interventions to maintain the \novervalued exchange rate, and increasing debt service on borrowed reserves. The rebuilding of \nreserves is crucial if the country wants to strengthen the buffers against external shocks and avoid \na  balance-of-payment  crisis.  The  Pakistan  rupee\u2013United  States  (US)  dollar  exchange  rate \ndropped 25% in 2018 to slow the decline of reserves, but this has had a limited effect on reserves.3 \n \n   \n                                                \n3  Appreciation in Pakistan\u2019s Real Effective Exchange Rate since 2014 impacted export competitiveness compared to \nother countries. Real Effective Exchange Rate peaked at 127.4 in April 2017 before it started to slide down to 111.1 \nin April 2018 and 104.3 in April 2019 as the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) allowed depreciation in nominal exchange \nrate against major currencies. \n ", "3 \nTable 1: External Sector Indicators \nItem  FY11  FY12  FY13  FY14  FY15  FY16  FY17  FY18 \nCurrent account balance  214  (4,658)  (2,496)  (3,130)  (2,796)  (4,867)  (12,621)  (19,897) \n($ million) \nBalance on trade in goods  (10,427)  (15,652)  (15,355)  (16,590)  (17,267)  (19,283)  (26,784)  (31,911) \n($ million) \nExports ($ million)  25,369  24,718  24,802  25,078  24,090  21,972  21,966  24,758 \nImports ($ million)  35,796  40,370  40,157  41,668  41,357  41,255  48,750  56,669 \nBalance on trade in  (2,029)  (3,305)  (1,564)  (2,650)  (2,970)  (3,406)  (4,339)  (6,068) \nservices ($ million) \nSBP gross reserves  16,614  11,905  7,198  10,509  14,836  19,446  17,550  11,341 \n($ million) \nSBP net reserves  14,784  10,803  6,009  9,098  13,534  18,143  16,142  9,789 \n($ million) \nAverage exchange rate  85.50  89.24  97.24  102.86  101.29  104.24  104.69  109.84 \n(PRs = $1.00) \n( ) = negative, FY = fiscal year, SBP = State Bank of Pakistan. \nNotes: (1) Exports and imports of goods are free-on-board values; (2) Net reserves exclude gold and foreign currency \ndeposits of commercial banks held with SBP. \nSource: State Bank of Pakistan database (http://www.sbp.org.pk/ecodata/BOP_arch/index.asp; last accessed on 4 July \n2019). \n \n7.  Constraints  on  export  performance.  Several  factors  contributed  to  the  poor \nperformance of exports in Pakistan. Following a policy of fiscal consolidation to reduce the fiscal \ndeficit, the government raised tax revenues to finance large development needs. Additional \nrevenues were raised largely from existing taxpayers, without broadening the tax base, putting an \nexcessive burden on corporate and trade players. Additional customs duties were imposed on \nmachinery (from 0% to 3%\u20135% since 2013) and intermediate goods to raise revenues, reduce \nimport demand, and narrow the balance-of-payment deficit. Average tariffs remain high and the \ntariff structure has become more complex, including 13 duty slabs with more than 7,000 tariff lines \nand reversing the progress of previous simplification efforts.4 Regulatory duties (an additional \ntrade tax) were imposed on 480 tariff lines, including 30% duty on iron and steel imports in 2016. \nCustoms duty exemptions (e.g., on machinery) could be availed of but are rarely sought in practice \nbecause of cumbersome documentary requirements. In the case of machinery and capital goods, \nexemption is subject to substantiation by the importers that the products are not made locally. \nThis tax regime increased the costs for exporters that depend on imported intermediate goods, \ncreating a negative impact on the competitiveness of domestic industries involved in global value \nchains. Domestic taxes are also set at high rates to raise revenues from a narrow tax base to \nmitigate fiscal expansion. Corporate tax rates remain relatively high at 31% in FY2016\u2013FY2017 \n(reduced from 34%) and the goods and services tax rate is 17%, which aggravates the tax burden \nand drives up the cost of doing business and the price of export goods. Diesel, a key input for \nindustry, transport, and agriculture in Pakistan, is subject to 34.5% sales tax and duty. \n \n8.  High raw material costs hurting exports. High tariffs and restrictions on the import of \nsynthetic products and fibers are keeping Pakistani manufacturers from producing high value-\nadded synthetic textile products, including finished garments, that better match global trends and \ndemand.5 This constrains the potential growth in export value and leads to the underperformance \n                                                \n4  Trade barriers are often justified as a means of reducing import competition and protecting jobs. But higher tariffs on \nessential inputs weaken the productivity and competitiveness of domestic firms and could in fact lead to a substantial \nnumber of job losses. Moreover, protectionist policies also have a detrimental impact on a country\u2019s position in global \nproduction networks for the same reasons. \n5  A. Mahmood and W. Ahmed. 2017. Export Performance of Pakistan: Role of Structural Factors. SBP Staff Notes. \n02/17. Karachi: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Estimates in the staff note suggest that 20%\u201330% of imported inputs \nhave been used at different stages of production in Pakistan. Despite the significant importance of imported inputs \nin production, Pakistan applies relatively high tariff rates compared with its peers and competitors. \n ", "4 \nof Pakistan\u2019s textile exports. Instead, Pakistan is competing with and in competition with low-tech \nproducts from lower-income countries with more competitive wages. Efforts to increase the \ncomplexity and diversity of Pakistan\u2019s exports face multiple hurdles, such as the composition of \nthe export goods basket, little opportunity to transition to higher-value products given the country\u2019s \ncurrent capabilities, low investment in research and development, and limited productivity and \nlabor skills.6 These binding constraints to higher-value production and stronger competitiveness \nare further corroborated in a 2013 World Bank study.7 \n \n9.  Overvalued exchange rate. To protect the budget from the impact of exchange rate \nfluctuations on imported goods and foreign debt service costs, the real effective exchange rate of \nthe Pakistan rupee was allowed to appreciate by more than 20% from 2013 to 2017, which further \neroded export competitiveness. By maintaining a mostly fixed nominal exchange rate against the \nUS dollar, the Pakistan rupee was overvalued by 10%\u201318% in July 2017, increasing import \ndemand and reducing export price competitiveness.8 The Pakistan rupee has been allowed to \ndevalue since 2018, which partially helped improve the price competitiveness of exporters. \n \n10.  Weak institutional capacity. Exports have suffered from the persistently high cost of \ndoing business in Pakistan; outages of grid-based electricity supply; high cost of electricity; and \nalarmingly high tax incidence on petroleum products, including diesel fuel.9 Despite unbundling \nthe Water and Power Development Authority in 1999 into separate electricity and water divisions, \nthe desired reforms\u2014to curb inefficiencies in the power generation, distribution, and transmission \nsystem; improve collection; and reduce line losses of more than 20%\u2014were not implemented. As \na result, export-oriented entrepreneurs bear the cost of these inefficiencies by paying inflated \nelectricity bills, putting them at a competitive disadvantage to other exporters in this region. \nFurthermore, the government withheld the refund of taxes and duties to exporters, which hurt their \nliquidity.10 Complex and cumbersome customs procedures for exporters and importers also \ncontribute to the high cost of doing business. In the trading across borders category of the World \nBank\u2019s 2018 Doing Business Survey, Pakistan ranked 171st out of 189 countries because of the \nhigh financial and time costs of clearing exports and imports at the border and complying with \ndocumentary requirements.11 This shows the need to streamline border control and documentary \nprocedures and to fully operationalize the National Single Window (NSW) for exporters and \nimporters. \n \n11.  The institutions and bodies established to provide essential trade-related services to \nexporters have inherent weaknesses. Institutions responsible for metrology and product testing, \ncertification  services  for  export  product  quality,  accreditation  services  for  testing  bodies, \nintellectual property rights enforcement, and establishment of special economic zones play a \ncritical role in trade facilitation and competitiveness.12 Both large and small businesses have \n                                                \n6  A.

For example, poor testing and certification facilities make the export of many \nagricultural  commodities  difficult.  In  addition,  limited  access  to  trade  finance  places  many \nexporters at a disadvantage to international competitors, which can access financial support from \ntheir country\u2019s national export credit agency, including credit enhancements, low-cost financing, \nand insurance for extended payment terms. The lack of trade finance seriously challenges \nPakistan\u2019s exporters, and did so especially after the financial crisis in 2008\u20132009. The full \noperationalization of the EXIMBP could remedy this.13 Financing constraints are even more \nserious for women entrepreneurs; lack of finance turned out to be the major bottleneck for \nbusinesswomen in World Bank surveys done in 2015 and 2016.14 \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n12.  The vision of the strategic trade policy framework (STPF), 2019\u20132023 is for Pakistan to \nbecome a dynamic and efficient domestic market and a globally competitive, export-driven \neconomy. Vision 2025 articulates the government\u2019s aim to encourage trade, increase exports, \nand improve the competitiveness of domestic industries in Pakistan as a means to reduce the \ncurrent account deficit and foster macroeconomic stability and sustained high growth.15 The STPF \nobjective is to make exports a driver of economic growth, reduce the relative disincentive for \nexport  industries  by  removing  structural  anomalies,  and  improve  the  trade  ecosystem  by \nincreasing institutional efficiencies and reducing the cost of doing business. The STPF\u2019s main \ngoals are to (i) increase exports at a minimum compound annual growth rate of 15% per year until \nFY2023; (ii) improve the competitiveness and efficiency of industry, especially the export industry, \nby restoring average mean tariffs to FY2011 levels; (iii) step up regional integration by raising \nregional trade\u2019s share of total trade by 20%; and (iv) promote sustainable, socially compliant, \ninclusive, and gender-sensitive export development. \n \n13.  The program will help define and implement key reforms to tackle the development \nchallenges discussed in paras. 7\u201311 and to improve Pakistan\u2019s export performance. The reforms \nare grouped in two areas under the programmatic approach, and all the 13 subprogram 1 policy \nactions have been completed.16 \n(i)  Tax and tariff rationalization. The principal objective is to promote a business \nenvironment that enables export competitiveness and facilitates private sector \ninvestment. The price competitiveness will be boosted by abolishing or reducing \nseveral regulatory and customs duties on raw materials and intermediate inputs. \nUnder subprogram 1, the government (i) submitted the draft national tariff policy to \nthe federal cabinet for approval, (ii) rationalized the tariff rates into a maximum of \nfour slabs with a 20% peak rate, (iii) abolished or reduced customs and regulatory \nduties on several raw materials and intermediate inputs, and (iv) reduced the \n                                                \n13 The World Bank commissioned a survey on trade and trade finance developments during the first quarter of 2009. \nThe survey of 425 firms and 78 banks in 14 developing countries across five regions confirmed that the global \nfinancial crisis constrained trade finance for exporters and importers in developing countries. The impact varied by \nfirm size, sector activity, and the country\u2019s integration into the global economy, but small and medium-sized \nenterprises were particularly vulnerable, making export diversification more difficult, especially in low-income \ncountries (M. Malouche. 2009. Trade and Trade Finance Developments in 14 Developing Countries Post September \n2008: A World Bank Survey. Policy Research Working Paper. No. 5138.

These reforms will continue with logically sequenced policy \nactions proposed for subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the government will (i) \napprove the national tariff policy, (ii) remove the requirement for importers to \nconfirm that all imported machinery and capital goods are not made locally to avail \nof customs duty exemption, (iii) exempt several raw materials and intermediate \ninputs from customs duties,17 (iv) reduce the corporate tax rate further to 28% and \nthe dividend tax from 15% to 10%, and (v) remove the electricity surcharge of \nPRs3.35 per kilowatt-hour on industrial consumers. \n(ii)  Institutional strengthening. The rationalization of taxes, duties, and tariffs cannot \nimprove  Pakistan\u2019s  exports  unless  the  trade-relevant  legal  and  institutional \nstructures  are  strengthened  at  the  same  time.18  The  program  targets  three \nimportant reform areas: operationalizing the NSW, operationalizing the EXIMBP, \nand strengthening the certification and accreditation systems. For subprogram 1, \nthe government (a) prepared the draft e-commerce policy framework; (b) approved \nthe operational rules for appointments, promotions, and transfers of Pakistan \nNational Accreditation Council (PNAC) employees, while PNAC published on its \nwebsite the long-term plans, policies, and schemes in line with international best \npractices, including export certification for gems and jewelry; (c) notified the high-\nlevel steering committee for the NSW, the project management office, and five \nworking groups to promote export facilitation;19 (d) approved the NSW blueprint \nand implementation plan to operationalize the NSW; (e) prepared the draft NSW \nact, which articulates the NSW business processes in line with international legal \nstandards  and  best  practices,  for  stakeholder  consultations;  (f) approved \namendments  to  the  Refinance  and  Credit  Guarantee  Scheme  for  Women \nEntrepreneurs in Underserved Areas to expand its applicability to all districts of \nPakistan  and  improve  women  entrepreneurs\u2019  access  to  finance  by  allowing \nworking capital financing; and (g) initiated the recruitment of a full-time professional \nchief executive officer for the EXIMBP. These reforms will continue with logically \nsequenced policy actions proposed for subprogram 2. Under subprogram 2, the \ngovernment will submit the draft e-commerce act to the National Assembly for \nconsideration. It will also amend the Pakistan National Accreditation Act, 2017 to \n(a) reconstitute the PNAC board of directors to include professionals with sector \nexpertise and scientific knowledge; restrict ex officio members to one-third of total \nboard members; ensure at least one woman on the board; and set a 3-year fixed \nterm for each board member, except for ex officio members; and (b) empower the \nboard of governors to recommend three candidates to the federal government for \nappointment as PNAC director general and/or chief executive officer. In addition, \nunder subprogram 2, the government will (a) ensure the approval of the long-term \n                                                \n17 The selected raw materials and intermediate inputs are in the policy matrix in Appendix 4. \n18 Without adequate human, institutional, and infrastructure capacity to participate effectively in international trade, \ncountries will not be able to expand the quantity and quality of goods and services they can supply to world markets \nat competitive prices (World Trade Organization. Building Trade Capacity). \n19 The single-window system in trade allows parties to lodge standardized information and documents with a single-\nentry point to fulfill all import, export, and transit-related regulatory requirements. After introducing the single window \nin Singapore, the time to process trade documents fell from 4 days to 15 minutes. Total savings for the business \ncommunity from using uTradeHub, a paperless trading system in the Republic of Korea, are estimated at \n$1.82 billion. Savings accrue from lower transmission costs by using e-documents; from greater productivity thanks \nto automated administration work; and from more efficient management, storage, and retrieval of information and \ndocuments thanks to information technology (S. Lim. 2012. Single Window Implementation: Benefits and Key \nSuccess  Factors.  Presentation  at  the  UNNExT  Capacity  Building  Workshop  for  Tajikistan  Single  Window \nImplementation. Bangkok. 18\u201319 November). \n ", "7 \nplans, policies, and schemes of PNAC; (b) submit a status report on the activities \nof PNAC\u2019s five working groups; (c) complete targeted activities as per the NSW \nblueprint and implementation plan; (d) submit the draft NSW act to the National \nAssembly for consideration; (e) finalize the transfer of modules and activities from \nthe web-based one customs (WeBOC) platform to the NSW; and (f) approve the \nEXIMBP business plan and financial model, and finalize the draft EXIMBP act. \n \n14.  A programmatic approach is needed because the structural reforms require a long-term \nhorizon to be implemented effectively. The implementation of most of the reforms must begin with \nessential changes to the legal, institutional, and human resource structures. Evaluating capacity \nconstraints while designing the reforms is equally important. Therefore, the sequencing of reforms \nwill remain critical. For example, operationalizing the NSW requires sufficient preparatory and \nimplementation time. Similarly, operationalizing the EXIMBP requires a gradual approach starting \nwith designing the business plan and the financial model. A programmatic approach is suitable \nfor chronologically sequencing the reforms in a multiyear framework. It also enables alignment of \npolicy actions with unavoidable realities and exogenous shocks. Moreover, the modality plays a \nleveraging and catalyzing role in coordinating the technical assistance (TA) support provided by \ndevelopment partners. \n \n15.  The value addition of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) stems from its long experience \nin designing and implementing policy-based loans in ADB developing member countries (DMCs), \nincluding Pakistan.20 These loans covered several areas of economic management, including \nrevenue mobilization and expenditure rationalization. ADB also supported reforms to state-owned \nenterprises and the energy sector in Pakistan. The program draws on lessons from these loans. \nStrong  government  commitment  and  adequate  support  from  all  stakeholders  are  the  two \nimportant prerequisites for a successful policy-based reform program. Thus, setting realistic policy \nactions, sequenced logically, is crucial to ensuring the government\u2019s commitment. These reforms \nwill also need to be supported by adequate capacity development assistance. \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s  value  addition  can  be  grouped  in  three  broad  categories:  (i)  facilitating  the \nidentification and sequencing of key reforms with immediate impact (tariff and tax rationalization) \nand medium-term impact (institutional strengthening), and international good practices in several \nareas of economic management; (ii) providing operational support to implement complex reforms \n(such as operationalizing the EXIMBP and the NSW) through transaction TA; and (iii) coordinating \nwith other development partners, especially the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World \nBank, to provide a unified reform package to the government. A stand-alone transaction TA \nproject totaling $750,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) \nwas approved on 5 September 2018 to support the effective preparation and implementation of \nthe program, including technical aid and capacity building.21 \n \n17.  Development partner and/or donor coordination. The ADB program team has been \nworking closely with other development partners and donors in Pakistan as part of the G5 group \n                                                \n20 ADB. 2016.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nof donors,22 as well as through other forums and meetings, to identify key structural reform areas. \nADB is coordinating efforts to improve trade and competitiveness with other development partners \nbased on a common set of reforms that are important to accelerate and sustain medium-term \ngrowth. It is coordinating with the IMF, in particular, which approved a new $6 billion extended \nfund facility program in 2019 for Pakistan to improve macroeconomic management. The previous \nfacility was completed in September 2016.23 The ADB program will complement the IMF-led \nreform initiatives by helping improve competitiveness, which in turn will help build up robust \nforeign exchange reserves. The IMF\u2019s emphasis on a market-driven exchange rate will also \ncomplement the program by improving the price competitiveness of Pakistan\u2019s exports.24 The \nWorld  Bank  is  processing  a  program-for-results  financing  (PforR)  modality  to  support  the \nimplementation of various actions under the STPF over 4\u20135 years.25 ADB\u2019s support for the NSW \ndraws  from  the  initial  plan  prepared  with  support  from  the  US  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment. ADB is also coordinating with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to \nfacilitate the design of its complementary reforms. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n18.  Pakistan\u2019s overarching development objective is to foster macroeconomic stability and \nsustainable high growth. Since trade is expected to play a vital role in this context, improving the \ncountry\u2019s export competitiveness remains an important pillar. The program will help achieve this \nthrough the proposed reforms, which will primarily assist Pakistan in making (i) its traditional \nexport items more price competitive in international markets; and (ii) the trade infrastructure and \ninstitutions conducive to higher exports and the diversification of export goods. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n19.  The reforms under the program will have significant cost implications for the government. \nRevenue losses from tax and tariff rationalization and the operationalization of the NSW and the \nEXIMBP will lead to additional fiscal stress. The amount of fiscal stress is estimated at $2 billion \nover 3 years. The government is in the midst of a comprehensive fiscal consolidation exercise to \n(i) bring the debt\u2013GDP ratio onto a firm downward trajectory, (ii) maintain a sustainable fiscal \ndeficit while safeguarding macroeconomic stability, and (iii) set the stage for sustainable and \ninclusive growth. This is expected to be achieved primarily through revenue mobilization and \nexpenditure rationalization. However, given the sluggish nature of short- to medium-term revenue \nimprovements  and  the  presence  of  large  nondiscretionary  expenditure  items,  the  ratio  of \nconsolidated fiscal deficit (including grants) to GDP is expected to increase from 6.8% in FY2019 \nto 7.1% in FY2020. The IMF\u2019s adjustment scenario projects the deficit (including grants) to drop \nto 5.2% in FY2021. As a result, the government will not have enough fiscal headroom to incur \nadditional development finance for the targeted reforms proposed under the program. This is a \n                                                \n22 The G5 consists of ADB, the IMF, the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, the US Agency \nfor International Development, and the World Bank. \n23 IMF. 2018. First Post-Program Monitoring Discussions\u2014Press Release; Staff Report; and Statement by the \nExecutive Director for Pakistan. Washington, DC. The report voices concern over Pakistan\u2019s rapidly depleting \nreserves, and highlights that sustained efforts are needed to ensure macroeconomic stability. \n24 Domestic currency depreciation also leads to higher prices of imported raw materials and intermediate goods. The \ntariff rationalization under the program is vital to ensure net benefits to exporters that import raw materials. \n25 The Pakistan Goes Global program aims to contribute to sustainable growth by increasing the integration of Pakistani \nfirms into the global economy through a sharp reduction of the economy\u2019s anti-export bias. It starts with the premise \nthat integration into global markets through trade and investment plays a crucial role in achieving that objective. The \nprogram has three pillars: (i) strengthening institutions to ensure effective service delivery and alignment of objectives \nat the federal level in terms of competitiveness, (ii) changing the incentives regimes under which firms operate to \nmake integration profitable for firms, and (iii) improving Pakistani firms\u2019 technology and innovations. \n ", "9 \nclear illustration of a hard budget constraint and its impact on development financing, given the \ndownward rigidity in nondiscretionary items of recurrent expenditure (salary, pensions, and \ninterest). Strong expenditure rationalization and revenue mobilization efforts will need to be \nmaintained rigorously to create room for additional reform-related expenditure, to the extent it is \nreflected in the federal budget, within the fiscal deficit targets. \n \n20.  Based on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB will provide policy-\nbased lending totaling $800 million, structured into two subprograms. For subprogram 1, the \ngovernment has requested a concessional loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. This will help the government compensate for revenue \nlosses already incurred from the tariff and corporate tax rationalization.26 The loan will have a 25-\nyear term, including a grace period of 5 years; an interest rate of 2% per year during the grace \nperiod and thereafter; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The Economic Reforms Unit of the Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency of the \nprogram. The Ministry of Finance, the Federal Board of Revenue, the Ministry of Commerce and \nTextiles, PNAC, and the EXIMBP are the proposed implementing agencies. The proceeds of the \npolicy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time). The programmatic approach is being implemented from \n1 January  2018  to  31  December  2020.  Subprogram  1  is  expected  to  be  implemented  by \n31 August 2019 and subprogram 2 is expected to be implemented by 31 December 2020. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n22.  Several program outputs have technical components at their core. Operationalizing the \nEXIMBP will require strong financial and project management as well as selection skills. Similarly, \noperationalizing the NSW will require sound technical knowledge. Capacity building support under \nthe program will assist the respective government departments in better managing these technical \noperations. \n \nB.  Economic \n \n23.  The program was subjected to economic analysis, the results of which demonstrate that \nits benefits considerably outweigh the costs. The key direct and indirect benefits considered are \nclassified into four groups. \n(i)  Given low but statistically significant price elasticity of export demand (-0.27), the \nrationalization  of  tariffs,  regulatory  duties,  and  commodity  taxes  will  improve \nPakistan\u2019s export competitiveness. This in turn will also facilitate higher growth by \ncreating  demand  for  necessary  locally  made  raw  materials.  This  is  also \ncorroborated by the Granger Causality test (see Economic Analysis). \n(ii)  Higher foreign exchange reserves will allow domestic output to increase, permitting \nthe resulting increase in imports. \n                                                \n26 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n(iii)  Several reforms related to trade facilitation, including better access to finance, will \nease supply-side constraints and lead to trade diversification, catering to the group \nwith a higher income elasticity of demand.27 \n(iv)  A reduction in the corporate tax rate will lead to more private investment. This in \nturn will lead to more growth, trade diversification, and job opportunities. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n24.  ADB  staff  conducted  a  governance risk  assessment  in  line  with  the Guidelines for \nImplementing  ADB\u2019s  Second  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Action  Plan.28  This  was \ncomplemented  by  a  review  of  areas  of  possible  risk  and  vulnerability  in  state  financial \nmanagement.  The  governance  assessment  found  risks  that  could  affect  the  programmatic \napproach, such as (i) weak political support for and government ownership of reforms, especially \nsensitive reforms; and (ii) weak institutional capacity, among other constraints. The financial \nmanagement  assessment  found  one  important  area  of  concern:  key  reforms  may  not  be \nimplemented  effectively  and  in  good  time  because  of  the  hard  budget  constraint  of  the \ngovernment. While no major risks of mismanagement of resources at the implementing level could \nbe discerned, areas relating to institutional capacity and financial sustainability, especially at the \nEXIMBP, were targeted for capacity development under the transaction TA and policy changes \nunder the program. \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n25.  The poverty reduction and social impacts of the program are positive. Support for better \ngrowth through higher export volumes will have a significant impact on job opportunities and will \nalso have an impact on income poverty, especially in a situation of rising inflation. Higher private \ninvestment is expected from the rationalization of the corporate tax rate and the dividend tax. The \nprogram  proposes  targeted  gender-related  actions.  Wider  access  to  finance  for  women \nentrepreneurs and easier certification of jewelry, for example, will have a significant impact on \nwomen exporters. Research shows that women entrepreneurs lack access to basic banking \nservices, a problem that is exacerbated when they apply for trade finance for exports. The \nprogram will address this issue and encourage further amendments to one of the bank finance \nschemes for women entrepreneurs,29 which was amended to cover all districts in Pakistan. \nTargeted gender interventions will continue under subprogram 2. The program will facilitate the \ninclusion of women on the PNAC board of directors. The transaction TA will help prepare a \ndatabase for women exporters in Pakistan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  Given the nature of the program, subprogram 1\u2019s safeguards classification is category C \nfor the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. \n \n                                                \n27 For example, J.
