THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan (PBL) to Mongolia for the Banking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability \nStrengthening Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for the \nBanking Sector Rehabilitation and Financial Stability Strengthening Program, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The  Government  of  Mongolia  has  requested  financial  assistance  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in the form of a PBL to stabilize and restructure the banking industry, \nstrengthen financial stability, and enhance competition among banks. The program aligns with \nand supports the government\u2019s Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and was requested by the \nMinister of Finance in the development policy letter in Appendix 3.1 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development challenges. The government faces two interrelated challenges: restoring \neconomic growth and reviving the banking industry. Mongolia\u2019s economy has deteriorated as it is \nhighly dependent on its mining industry and is vulnerable to shocks. Mineral exports have declined \ndue to falling commodity prices and moderating growth in the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nMongolia\u2019s largest trading partner. The growth rate of its gross domestic product (GDP) fell from \n17.5% in 2011 to 1.0% in 2016, and the fiscal deficit rose from 5.0% of GDP in 2015 to 15.4% of \nGDP in 2016, amounting to MNT3,667.8 billion. As a result, the ratio of public debt to GDP, \nexcluding central bank liabilities and state-owned enterprise debt, rose from 31.0% in 2010 to \n83.1%  in  2016.  Consequently,  Moody\u2019s  Investors  Service  Singapore  Pte  Ltd.  downgraded \nMongolia\u2019s credit rating to Caa1 in November 2016.2 \n \n4.  The government responded quickly by passing the ERP in 2016. The ERP aims to (i) \nreduce balance-of-payment pressures; (ii) increase foreign exchange reserves; (iii) intensify the \nimplementation of infrastructure projects; and (iv) implement strategies to increase foreign direct \ninvestment, job growth, and economic diversification. However, weaknesses in the banking \nsystem have constrained government efforts to restore macroeconomic stability and growth. High \nlevels of nonperforming loans (NPLs) impede financial intermediation and reduce the banking \nindustry\u2019s capacity to increase private sector credit and support job creation. Unless addressed \nquickly, elevated NPL levels will continue to depress financial intermediation and credit growth, \njeopardize the ERP\u2019s implementation, continue the gridlock in markets like property, detract from \nfinance sector development, and further heighten bank vulnerabilities. \n \n5.  Slowing economic growth, combined with increases in the central bank\u2019s policy rate, has \nreduced loan growth.3 Moreover, declining GDP is depressing business conditions, leading to a \nrise in bank NPLs and threatening the solvency of banks. The banking industry\u2019s aggregate NPL \n                                                \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016. Economic Recovery Program, 2016\u20132020. Ulaanbaatar. The government passed \nthe ERP on 24 November 2016. \n2  Moody's downgraded the government's long-term issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B3 to Caa1 on 18 \nNovember 2016. Caa1 refers to a country\u2019s long-term foreign currency credit rating, and is considered non-\ninvestment grade and speculative. \n3  The volume of loans declined by 1% during 2014\u20132016. \n ", "2 \nratio increased from 3.8% in June 2013 to 8.5% in December 20164 (15.0% when past due loans \nare incorporated).5  Compounding this problem, the currency declined 25.3 percentage points \nagainst the United States (US) dollar in 2016, exposing additional financial vulnerabilities. The \nMongolian National Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported a rising number of small \nand medium-sized enterprise (SME) bankruptcies due to increased debt service requirements \nfrom loans made in US dollars. In 2016, about 19% of banking system loans were denominated \nin a foreign currency as banks often preferred to lend to SMEs in US dollars to maximize interest \nmargins and help balance foreign currency open positions. \n \n6.  Overall, weak oversight encouraged regulatory forbearance and the underreporting of \nrisks,  primarily  of  NPLs,  because  of  lenient  restructuring  policies  and  noncompliance  with \ninternational capital standards. This has resulted in the overstatement of the reported banking \nindustry consolidated total capital adequacy ratio that stood at 18.5% as of the end of 2016. The \nloan loss provision covers only 44.8% of NPLs and past due loans, relative to the international \nbest practice of 100.0%, and return on assets was only 0.7% for 2016, which is insufficient to \ncover additional provisioning and capital augmentation.6 \n \n7.  Empirical evidence shows strong links between finance sector development, economic \ngrowth, and poverty alleviation.7 Lessons from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis show that \nrapid NPL resolution is essential to strengthen credit flows and hasten economic recovery. Higher \nlevels of NPLs reduce credit-to-GDP ratios, lower growth, and increase unemployment.8 Financial \ninclusion impediments may stem from concerns regarding access to credit, the depth of the credit \nmarket, and inefficient credit intermediation. When blockages arise in these areas, financing for \nindividuals, SMEs, and entrepreneurs is impaired most due to their perceived higher credit risk. \nThe resulting inequality and inefficiency in credit allocation will negatively impact economic growth \nand thus hamper inclusive growth. The ultimate result is reduced credit relative to GDP. The credit-\nto-GDP gap, which is the difference between the credit-to-GDP ratio and its long-term trend, is a \nuseful early warning indicator for banking crises.9  The deterioration in credit intermediation in \nMongolia is outlined in Table 1, which shows the credit-to-GDP gap for Mongolia and indicates \nthe downward trend in credit supply during the period when NPLs increased from 5.3% in 2013 \nto 8.5% in 2016, reflecting the banking industry crisis. \n \nTable 1: Ratio of Credit to Gross Domestic Product \n(%) \n   2013  2014  2015 \nCredit-to-GDP ratio (actual)  61.6  59.7  50.3 \nCredit-to-GDP trend (estimate)  64.0  61.0  52.1 \nCredit-to-GDP ratio gap   (2.4)   (1.4)   (1.8) \n( ) = negative, GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource:  Asian  Development  Bank  estimates;  Bank  for  International  Settlements.

Binding constraints. Mongolia\u2019s finance sector is facing three major challenges. First, \nthe government does not have a framework for resolving the high level of NPLs in banks that \njeopardize their solvency and has not developed a bank rehabilitation framework to facilitate bank \nrecapitalization. The lack of an out-of-court corporate debt-restructuring arrangement further \nconstrains stabilization efforts. Second, the financial stability framework is not robust enough to \nprevent possible crises. The relevant law and supporting regulations of the Financial Stability \nCouncil (FSC) do not fully address  its mandate, membership, authority, tools, and powers \nneeded.10 Further, widespread nonconformance with international capital adequacy and banking \nsupervision standards impair banks\u2019 capacity to sustain shocks. Weak supervisory oversight and \nregulatory  forbearance  practices  by  the  Bank  of  Mongolia  (BOM)  have  resulted  in  banks \nrescheduling past due loans and NPLs too leniently, while the deposit insurance fund lacks \nbackup funding to support possible claims. Third, banking competition and development are \nimpaired. Weak governance and risk management practices and a lack of strategic direction \nimpede the creation of a competitive environment that meets the private sector\u2019s needs and will \nattract human and financial capital. Government ownership of the State Bank LLC also creates \ngovernance and development issues that impede competition and the development of expanded \nproducts  and  services,  as  government  interests  unduly  influence  the  bank\u2019s  operations.11 \nRegulations do not clearly support the licensing and operation of foreign bank subsidiaries, \nimpairing competition, access to credit, and the transfer of best practices in risk management. \n \n9.  Government  plans  and  alignment  with  ADB  strategy.  Following  the  June  2016 \nelections, the government passed the ERP to promote foreign direct investment, job growth, and \neconomic  diversification.  With  regard  to  finance,  the  ERP  (i)  aims  to  strengthen  sector \ngovernance, (ii) includes legal and institutional reforms to ensure the BOM\u2019s independence, (iii) \nprovides for the revision of the foreign exchange law and FSC functions and authority, and (iv) \ncalls for the preparation of a finance development plan through 2025. \n \n10.  The government has not formally defined a distinct national finance policy; however, the \nnational development strategy, 2008\u20132021 calls for strengthening the banking and financial \nsystem consistent with practices found in highly developed countries.12 Key activities include (i) \nstrengthening the nonbanking financial system and operations, (ii) developing the securities and \ncapital market, and (iii) strengthening risk management in banking and financial institutions. \nMongolia\u2019s Sustainable Development Vision 2030 also aims to establish sound development \nfinance and a financial market that would promote stable economic growth, increase the role of \nnonbank financial institutions, and stabilize the soundness of financial institutions.13 The program \naligns closely with the first pillar of ADB\u2019s proposed country partnership strategy for Mongolia, \nwhich promotes economic growth and social stability.14 It is consistent with the ADB Strategy \n                                                \n10 The FSC was established in January 2010 by an amendment to the Law on the Bank of Mongolia and a regulation \nissued in April 2010. The council members are the minister of finance, governor of the BOM and the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF), the BOM, and the chair of the Financial Regulatory Commission. The FSC identifies and monitors \nsystemic risks, and proposes actions to mitigate these risks to protect and enhance the resilience of Mongolia\u2019s \nfinancial system. \n11 The State Bank was established by the government from the assets of two failed banks in 2009, and it assumed the \nassets of the failed Savings Bank in 2013; it is the fifth-largest of 14 banks in Mongolia with a 10% deposit share. \nThe assets of the top five banks comprise 83% of total banking industry assets. \n12 Government of Mongolia. 2007.

ADB has extensively coordinated the objectives of \nthis program with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. On 19 February \n2017, the IMF reached staff-level agreement with the government on a 3-year extended fund \nfacility.  The  program  is  consistent  with  the  IMF\u2019s  recommendations  and  will  support  the \nrecapitalization and restructuring of the banking industry, enhance regulation and supervision, \nand improve governance. The program is also consistent with the World Bank\u2019s plans to support \nfinancial stability and the finance sector by developing the capacity of the Deposit Insurance \nCorporation of Mongolia (DICOM). \n \nContributions of Previous ADB Assistance to the Program \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \na  ADB. 2016.

ADB\u2019s strength lies in its experience in deep \npolicy  engagement,  lending  operations,  and  extensive  capacity  development  in  finance.  In \nparticular, ADB assistance has focused on supporting a stable finance sector and providing the \n                                                \n15 ADB. 2008.

ADB has also contributed to economic \ndiversity and mitigated the risk exposures affecting SMEs and the poor. Prior ADB assistance for \nfinance sector reform set a foundation for the outputs of this program (Figure).16 ADB provided \nthe basic outline for the establishment of an NPL resolution mechanism, promoted a framework \nfor financial consumer protection, enhanced the stability of savings and credit cooperatives, and \nexpanded the capacity of the FSC secretariat function located within the BOM. ADB supported \nefforts to restructure banks; establish a bank deposit insurance system; and strengthen banking \nlegislation  and  regulations,  including  expanding  the  BOM\u2019s  capacity,  banking  industry \ngovernance, and risk management. ADB has also promoted capital market development and the \nexpansion of inclusive financial services for the poor. Finally, ADB has extensively supported \nprivate sector development through onlending programs to Khan Bank, Xac Bank, and TenGer \nFinancial Group LLC, which helped finance micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises. \n \n13.  Lessons learned. The program builds on lessons learned from prior ADB engagement in \nMongolia\u2019s finance sector and from the experience of dealing with past finance sector crises in \ndeveloping markets across Asia. A key lesson is to support processes through a sequenced \napproach over time, whereby current outputs result from prior policy and capacity development \nwork with counterparts. Prior engagement has helped guide the government\u2019s efforts, leading to \nthe financial infrastructure and policy reforms that this program supports. A second lesson is the \nneed for a realistic policy framework with manageable policy actions to achieve the intended \nresults and successfully implement the reforms. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The program aligns with the ERP and will support the government\u2019s plans for a well-\ndeveloped finance sector and stable financial system that helps the poor and vulnerable. The \noutcome will be a strengthened and stable banking industry. Stabilizing the industry by dealing \nrapidly with the large NPL overhang is the first step towards rehabilitation. As the program is a \nsingle tranche, ADB and the government have agreed on a medium-term reform framework, \n2017\u20132020 to provide a basis for continuing reforms and structure for future assistance. There \nare 12 policy actions with seven linked to disbursement. All policy actions are complied with or \nare expected to be completed by June 2017. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  Output 1: Framework for bank restructuring completed. Output 1 will support an \neffective restructuring of the banking industry and a reduction in NPLs. To accomplish this, the \ngovernment will develop a transparent road map for a banking industry rehabilitation program, \nand will create and initially capitalize an asset management company (AMC). Effective private \nmarket solutions are lacking because the high level of unresolved NPLs exceeds the absorptive \ncapacity of the domestic illiquid capital market. Banks often lack the capacity to handle large \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2016.

Centralized AMCs achieve economies of scale and allow \nfor the more effective management and sale of distressed assets. Moreover, the legal and capital \nmarket\u2019s framework in Mongolia is challenging and impedes banks\u2019 ability to resolve NPLs rapidly. \nIn this context, a government-supported AMC has advantages based on the following special \npowers, which will be granted to it by law: (i) legislation will ensure that AMC operations are \nefficient, transparent, and market-based to maximize NPL recovery values; (ii) AMC management \nand staff will be given immunity and legal protection in the operation of their duties; and (iii) \nmechanisms to enable the clear transfer of distressed assets will be included. \n \n16.  The AMC will acquire eligible NPLs from commercial banks at values determined by a \nrigorous and transparent methodology17 (these will be lower than the book values to reflect the \nNPLs\u2019 deteriorated condition). The AMC will manage this portfolio of assets, take steps to \nmaximize their recovery values, and sell them over time. The government will also support the \ncreation of a corporate debt restructuring committee (CDRC) to deal with the large debt burden \nthrough an inter-creditor agreement. A CDRC provides a platform for corporations and their \nlenders to work out feasible debt resolutions without resorting to legal proceedings or bankruptcy. \nThe out-of-court arrangement found in an inter-creditor agreement enables eligible distressed \ncorporations to resolve their nonperforming obligations uniformly across multiple lenders. The \nprocess facilitates the timely and orderly restructuring of debt to support firms that have a viable \nbusiness model but are experiencing a temporary downturn. \n \n17.  Output 2: Financial stability enhanced. Output 2 will enhance financial stability and \noversight to prevent problems from recurring. The government will amend the law governing FSC \noperations to clarify its mandate, authority, and tools; and will expand the FSC\u2019s membership to \ninclude the DICOM. The output will also support stronger oversight of the banking industry to \ndiscourage regulatory forbearance. The BOM will restructure its supervision department and \namend regulations to bring banking practices into compliance with international standards. Finally, \nthe government will expand the DICOM\u2019s capacity to deal with possible bank insolvencies by \nproviding financing for the potential payout of deposit claims. \n \n18.  Output  3:  Competition  and  governance  strengthened.  Output  3  will  strengthen \ngovernance, risk management, and banking industry competition to protect the finance sector\u2019s \ndevelopment and attract foreign capital and expertise. The government will improve the sector\u2019s \ncapacity and governance to meet its functional needs better, as well as those of individuals and \ncorporations  by  formulating  a  financial  market  development  program.  It  will  also  expand \ncompetition and the banking industry\u2019s potential to adopt best practices in risk management by \nclarifying the regulations supporting (i) the licensing and regulation of foreign bank subsidiaries, \nand (ii) the privatization of the State Bank. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n19.  The government has requested a regular loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program (Table 2). The loan will have a 15-year term, including a \ngrace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 9.25 years and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n                                                \n17 Eligible NPLs exclude those that will be resolved in a CDRC process and those that are not commercially viable to \nbe managed by the AMC due to their small size or unique characteristics not allowing for economies of scale. \n ", "7 \n \n20.  The loan proceeds will finance the full foreign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and \nduties) of the items procured, excluding ineligible items and imports on the negative list attached \nto the loan agreement. The loan size was determined based on the importance of supporting the \nERP, the extent of the fiscal gap, the level of NPLs and past due loans needing resolution, and \nMongolia\u2019s overall development financing needs. Given the country\u2019s challenging fiscal condition, \nthe use of budget support is justified. Specifically, the loan proceeds will support the AMC\u2019s \nfunding and capitalization needs and help it purchase a share of eligible NPLs and past due loans. \nBonds issued by the AMC and exchanged with banks for the transferred assets will cover the \nremaining funding needs. \n \nTable 2: Investment and Financing Plan \nSource  Amount ($ million)  Share of Total (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (loan)  100.0  100.0 \nTotal  100.0  100.0 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n21.

ADB proposed a single-tranche, stand-alone PBL, as the \nscope and timing for potential future assistance will be identified only after the result of this \nprogram and the impact of the IMF\u2019s program are known. The PBL will help the government create \nan AMC that will help banks deal with the large NPL overhang. ADB will not assume risk from the \npurchased NPLs, which will be managed independently under market practices through the \ncreation  of  an AMC  and  CDRC.  Mongolia\u2019s  payment  obligations  under  the ADB  loan  are \nindependent of the NPL collection or the AMC\u2019s performance. Should banks ultimately require \nrecapitalization,  private  commercial  banks  are  expected  to  be  fully  supported  by  their \nshareholders.  The  program  combines  dialogue  with  TA  in  recognition  of ADB\u2019s  long-term \nengagement in developing Mongolia\u2019s finance sector. The program is urgently needed to manage \nrising banking risks and prevent a systemic crisis that could threaten the economy, further reduce \nGDP growth prospects, and harm the poor and vulnerable even more. ADB and the government \nhave agreed on a medium-term reform framework, 2017\u20132020 to provide the basis for continuing \nreforms and the structure for future assistance. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n22.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  will  oversee  and \ncoordinate the timely implementation of the policy actions. The BOM will be the implementing \nagency and will implement certain policy actions under the PBL. MOF will withdraw the loan \nproceeds in line with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time) \nonce ADB is satisfied that the agreed policy actions have been completed. The program will \nsupport a policy framework with corresponding outputs and policy actions (Appendix 4). Of the \nprogram\u2019s 12 policy actions, seven are linked to disbursement and the rest are complementary \nactions that reflect the progressive steps taken to achieve the overall policy action objectives. \nThey aim to reflect more holistically the government\u2019s commitments to reform. The government \nwill maintain or advance the policy actions at least through December 2019. ADB may consider a \nfollow-on program based on the progress of the reforms and the development financing needs. \nThe program period is 1 July 2015\u201330 June 2017. \n \n ", "8 \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  The program will be supported by TA grants in the amount of $1,600,000, of which \n$750,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-\n6)  and  $750,000  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development \nPartnership Special Fund.18 ADB will engage TA consultants through a firm. Selection will follow \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using the \nquality- and cost-based method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10, following a full technical \nproposal. ADB  will  disburse  TA  resources  following  its  Technical Assistance  Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff, access to data and documents, facilities for key meetings, and other \nin-kind contributions. The MOF will be the executing agency and the BOM will be the implementing \nagency. The TA is estimated to begin in July 2017 and will be implemented over 24 months.19 The \nTA will provide 48 international and 31 national person-months of consulting services. The TA will \nhelp establish and operationalize the AMC, and will create a transparent and effective oversight \nand governance process that supports the AMC\u2019s independent operations, free from external \npolitical influences and vested interests. The TA will also establish and guide the operations of an \nout-of-court corporate debt-restructuring framework to address the corporate debt burden through \nthe Mongolian Bankers Association, with the BOM\u2019s support. Finally, the TA will guide and support \nthe government in privatizing the State Bank. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic. Through support for NPL resolution mechanisms including the creation of an \nAMC, the program will improve prospects for GDP growth, employment and credit extension. \nProgram support will help the banking industry reduce the volume of NPLs, which will then allow \nbanks to reduce risks and raise capital adequacy levels, enabling them to extend new credit more \nfreely. Expanding credit availability will positively impact employment and income. The benefits \nwill accrue to all Mongolians.  Applicable research by the IMF shows that, other things being equal, \na one percentage point increase in NPLs results in a cumulative decline of 1.5 percentage points \nin  the  credit-to-GDP  ratio,  and  a  cumulative  increase  of  nearly  0.5  percentage  points  in \nunemployment (over a 3-year horizon). Also, a one percentage point rise in NPLs leads to a \ncumulative contraction of 1.3 percentage points in real GDP over 2 years. 20 \n \n25.  Financial management. Procyclical fiscal management and the misalignment of public \nexpenditure and strategic priorities are two major public financial management challenges in \nMongolia. The government has put certain actions in place to provide strategic guidance for the \nannual budget process and reduce vulnerability to the boom\u2013bust economic cycle; however, these \nhave been ineffective due to poor windfall revenue management and frequent amendments \naffecting budget expenditure. The comprehensiveness of information included in the budget, its \npublic disclosure, and citizen participation have improved, but recent increases in off-budget \nexpenditures and limited oversight of fiscal risks in state-owned enterprises undermine progress.  \nThe  IMF-led  program  will  help  improve  public  financial  management  by  preventing  the \ngovernment from engaging in quasi-fiscal activity, creating a fiscal council to provide independent \nbudget forecasts and costings of new policy proposals, allowing the government sole authority to \n                                                \n18 Established by ADB, with the Government of Luxembourg as a financing partner. \n19 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Ibid 8. \n ", "9 \ndetermine the total amount of spending in the budget, and granting MOF the authority to approve \nproposals to the cabinet that have a budgetary cost. Due diligence relied on the 2015 public \nfinancial management assessment completed by the World Bank.21  ADB confirmed that the \nresults of the assessment remain valid for this program and that no specific mitigating measures \nare needed. The MOF has sufficient financial management capabilities and is familiar with ADB\u2019s \ndisbursement requirements, social and environmental safeguards, and negative list. Financial \nmanagement assessments in 2015 for ADB-funded projects have also deemed the MOF capable \nof acting as an executing agency.22 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n26.  Governance. Mongolia has taken steps to improve accountability and transparency in the \npublic sector. The Independent Authority Against Corruption has implemented public education \ncampaigns. Reporting coverage of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in Mongolia is \nalso expanding. Despite these efforts, corruption continues to threaten the development of the \nMongolian economy.23 Major corruption risks include weak institutions and enforcement, lack of \ncapacity of integrity institutions, political interference, lack of transparency and accountability, and \nthe  prevalence  of  conflicts  of  interest. The  policy  actions  under  the  IMF-led  program  and \nmonitoring indicators would ensure strict compliance with the program objectives and thereby \nminimize risks. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n27.  The economic slowdown in Mongolia has reduced employment opportunities, lowered \nincome, delayed loan repayment, weakened loan access, depreciated the currency, decreased \nbank loan growth, and increased lending rates. It has also constrained access to credit, which is \na key factor affecting the creation of new jobs and employment. Mongolian poverty data shows \nthat the percentage of the population living in poverty declined from 27.4% in 2012 to 21.6% in \n2014; however, the data also show a significant clustering of households near the poverty line, \nindicating that many people are vulnerable to falling back into poverty because of shocks or \nprolonged economic stress.24 Poor households cope by (i) reducing food consumption and quality, \n(ii) limiting health expenditure, and (iii) increasing debt (38% of the poor have debt). Access to \ncredit is an important coping strategy, and 82% of the lowest income quintile took out loans almost \nsolely to support household consumption (including food, health and education, and other daily \nlife needs) compared with 49% of the highest quintile.  The program will have a positive impact \non access to credit, and will improve economic growth and employment prospects. Successful \nprogram implementation and a strengthened banking industry will benefit all Mongolians, and the \nunemployed, poor, and vulnerable in particular. In the long term, the government\u2019s plans will \ninvolve systems for implementing an efficient finance policy that will ultimately benefit the poor \nand vulnerable by developing a favorable business environment, increasing job opportunities, \nreducing loan interest rates, and expanding the acceptability of loan collateral. \n                                                \n21 World Bank. 2015.
