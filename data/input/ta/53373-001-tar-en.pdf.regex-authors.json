INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Members of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) include 10 countries that are considered \nto be in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) and 14 small island developing states \n(SIDS).1 In Strategy 2030, ADB made a number of commitments to FCAS and SIDS. These \ninclude prioritizing support for the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the region, including \nFCAS  and  SIDS;  augmenting  resources  to  accommodate  the  added  costs  of  identifying, \nprocessing,  and  implementing  projects  and  investments  in  these  countries;  and  pursuing \ndevelopment impact as the key objective of its private sector operations. Strategy 2030 states \nthat  \u201cADB  will  expand  its  private  sector  operations  in  new  and  frontier  markets,  including \nchallenging markets such as FCAS and SIDS. In the process, ADB will consider smaller deal \nsizes with potentially higher risk and development impacts, including inclusive business models.\u201d2 \n \n2.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide funds for \nresearch and development to strengthen the capacity of current and potential private sector \ncompanies in FCAS and SIDS developing member countries (DMCs) so they can meet ADB\u2019s \nrequirements for private sector investment. Assistance provided under the TA may be used for \ncapacity development and/or to identify projects that are suitable for project concept paper \npreparation.3 Where possible, the TA will seek to strengthen climate change and gender impacts \nin private sector investment.4 \n \n3.  The TA is not included in any country operations business plans or regional cooperation \nbusiness plans.5 The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and ADB\u2019s operational plan for \nprivate  sector  operations,  2014\u20132024.  It  is  also  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  operational  priority  2: \naccelerating progress in gender equality; and operational priority 3: tackling climate change, \nbuilding climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.6 The TA isin \nline with the priorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020, which strongly emphasizes, under \n \n1  For ADB\u2019s operations during 2019, 10 developing member countries (DMCs) are classified as FCAS, 7 of which are \nPacific DMCs and demonstrate the effects of fragility. These are Kiribati, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States \nof Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. The remaining three countries are \nAfghanistan, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste. ADB follows the United Nations definition, which defines SIDS as all states \nthat participate in the Alliance of Small Island States. Sixteen ADB DMCs are currently classified as SIDS. All 14 \nADB Pacific DMCs are SIDS. The remaining two SIDS are Timor-Leste and Maldives. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila \nstates that ADB (i) will assist in preparing bankable projects that can attract private sector financing by undertaking \n\u201cproject incubation and preparation,\u201d \u201chelping make projects viable through ADB participation, TA, blended finance, \nand other instruments;\u201d and (ii) \u201cthrough its private sector operations promote commercial sustainability through high \nstandards of corporate governance, integrity, transparency, and social and environmental safeguards.\u201d \n3  Examples of the former could include assistance to a company to review or build on its environmental and safeguards \napproaches, internal policies, and procedures to strengthen gender inclusion, prevent corruption, and/or enhance \ntransparency, in compliance with international best practice. The latter could include engaging external legal, \ntechnical, or commercial advisors to structure an investment, perform initial due diligence, or negotiate a concession \nto ensure that it is bankable from a commercial perspective. \n4  In the Pacific, women face gender-based violence; inequitable income-earning and/or economic opportunities; limited \nparticipation in decision-making processes; gender stereotypes and rigid definitions of masculinity, femininity, and \ngender roles and responsibilities; limited political representation; limited representation in senior positions in the \nprivate and public sectors; and inadequate access to health care, education, electricity, clean water, and sanitation. \n5  In accordance with the staff instructions on business processes for knowledge and support TA, Vice-President, \nPrivate Sector Operations and Public\u2013Private Partnerships approved the concept paper on 3 December 2019. The \nTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 December 2019. \n6  ADB. 2019. Operational Priority 2: Accelerating Progress in Gender Equity.

It is also aligned with ADB\u2019s Climate Change Operational Framework, 2017\u2013\n2030; 7 the  Pacific  Regional  Operations  Business  Plan,  2019\u20132021; 8 and  ADB\u2019s  country \npartnership strategy for Fiji, 2019\u20132023, which is committed to achieving sustained, inclusive, \nprivate sector-led growth.9 The TA seeks to respond to recommendations made in the corporate \nevaluation.10 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  There are many challenges to identifying bankable projects in FCAS and SIDS. Pacific \nisland DMCs face special development challenges because of their geographical remoteness, \nextremely small populations and economies, limited institutional capacity, and vulnerability to \nnatural and other external shocks. They are particularly vulnerable to climate change and natural \nhazards. The atolls of Kiribati, Maldives, the Marshall Islands, and Tuvalu face disproportionately \nhigher risks from climate change, which may eventually render them uninhabitable. Unstable \nsecurity or the perceived lack of transparency may undermine normal business operations.  \n \n5.  The cost of doing business in FCAS and SIDS is higher than normal. The markets are \nsmall. The credit risks are high. Low risk-adjusted returns often do not meet the requirements to \nbe considered for ADB\u2019s nonsovereign operations or other financing without a high level of \nsponsor support or multilateral development bank- or donor-funded credit enhancements to de-\nrisk financing by commercial banks. An effective or certain regulatory base is often lacking, \nrequiring legal arrangements to be governed by non-local laws or offshore structures to be \nestablished so investors can hold collateral that can be readily enforced.11 In addition, the \ninvestment costs to process a large investment are similar to those for a small investment, and \nmay be even higher if the project is the first in a given sector or country.12 Costs are often inflated \nby the capacity of government or the business environment.13 These costs are usually borne by \nthe client in traditional private sector investments. Thus, the costs to the private sector company \nare disproportionately high and can discourage private sector participation. \n \n6.  As a result, ADB has not historically invested in private sector initiatives in FCAS and SIDS. \nBecause of the challenges in identifying bankable projects, the critical objective of ensuring that \nthe project provides gender additionality. An ADB Policy Brief summarizes that the weakest areas \nin countries with fragile and conflict-affected situations are the lack of policies for social inclusion \nand gender equity is often minimized or overlooked.14 This unconscious or conscious oversight is \n \n7  ADB. 2017.

Manila. \n11 For example, in Afghanistan, ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel has received advice that an assignment of rights \nunder a contract may not be recognized. To limit the exposure to legal uncertainty, it may be preferable to provide \nfor an assignment to be governed by English law and all related project documents to be governed by such law until \nthe issue has been clarified by the legislators. \n12 For example, ADB has been asked to bank the first wind farm power purchase agreement in Afghanistan and the \nfirst Tonga independent power plant power purchase agreement. Both will require enhancements to be acceptable \nto investors, even though the governments concerned have received some support from multilateral development \nbanks to bring the projects to the market. \n13 For example, government-owned counterparties may be unfamiliar with the structure or investment documentation \nleading to prolonged negotiations or challenges creating collateral for investors. \n14  ADB. 2017. New Thinking for Fragile States.  Manila. \n \n ", "3 \n \noften based on the erroneous assumption that gender-integrated projects are less profitable. \nHowever, the evidence demonstrates that this is not the case.15 \n \n7.  As of November 2019, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) has 13 \nprojects valued at $1,037 million in the FCAS countries of Afghanistan and Myanmar, of which \nthree are categorized as providing gender equity, three are categorized as providing effective \ngender mainstreaming, and three are categorized as providing some gender elements.16 No \nprojects achieved more than low climate change impacts. PSOD has three projects valued at \n$132 million in SIDS, including one that promotes effective gender mainstreaming and high \nclimate change impact. \n \n8.  The TA will help maximize the projects\u2019 potential to positively affect gender issues and \nclimate change. These projects have partly come about because of ADB\u2019s ability to provide \nadditional human and financial resources to develop the capacity of the client to meet ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. These inputs also serve as ADB\u2019s development additionality\u2014benefits to the client \nfrom its association with ADB, which would not have been realized without ADB\u2019s partnership. To \ndate, these inputs have been provided under a range of TA projects. ADB will be able to better \ntrack  inputs  toward  these  investments  through  TA  by  pooling  resources  to  assist  project \ndevelopment and implementation in FCAS and SIDS. In some instances, with TA support, ADB \nwill be able to adapt its ongoing programs to meet the specific operational challenges and needs \nof these markets. For example, ADB\u2019s ongoing Microfinance Risk Participation Program will use \nTA funds to enhance the adaptability of its features and will focus on the gender and climate-\nchange-resilience aspects of facilitating housing finance in FCAS and SIDS.17 The views of civil \nsociety organizations, which have understanding of the local context, will be sought to help ensure \nthat ADB investments have the greatest possible development impact. \n \n9.  The TA will also help PSOD identify and enhance the potential bankability of some projects \nalready in the market, particularly those with the potential to advance gender equality and/or \ntackle climate-related issues. Although ADB\u2019s Office of Public\u2013Private Partnership is focused on \nbringing more bankable projects to the market, there is a gap in the types of services offered by \nADB to identify and enhance the bankability of existing projects.18 A comprehensive approach is \nrequired to bring to the market more bankable projects that comply with international best practice \nand advance gender equality and/or address climate risk. The TA will provide ADB with the \nopportunity to support small targeted initiatives to assist with filling this gap. The TA is not intended \nto replace small-scale TA or specific TA for a large-scale project. \n \n15 A McKinsey study found that the return on equity for companies with the highest percentage of women on their \nexecutive committees was 41% higher than for companies with all-male executives. McKinsey Global Institute. 2018. \nThe power of parity: Advancing women\u2019s equality in Asia Pacific. New York. \n16 Collectively, these investments constitute 7.14% of PSOD\u2019s current portfolio. There are seven more projects in the \npipeline valued at $134 million. In Myanmar, PSOD\u2019s portfolio has been almost equal to the outstanding sovereign \noperations, which clearly differentiates the country from other FCAS and SIDS. As such, the TA is expected to have \na different objective in Myanmar than identifying bankable projects. In Myanmar, the TA will seek to mainstream key \nthematic considerations, including responding to climate change under potential PSOD projects in Myanmar, and \nmore broadly under other private sector-led projects in the near future. \n17 ADB. 2017.Proposed Guarantee and Unfunded Risk Participation Products for Additional Financing \u2013 Microfinance \nRisk Participation and Guarantee Program (Regional).

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) ADB\u2019s private sector geographic coverage \nin FCAS and SIDS widened, (ii) development impact as the key objective of private sector \noperations pursued, and (iii) bankable private sector projects prepared.19 The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: ADB investment and development impact in FCAS and SIDS increased.20 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Assistance provided to companies in FCAS and SIDS to strengthen \ncapacity of private sector companies to meet ADB\u2019s requirements for private sector \ninvestment. As opportunities or needs are identified with current or potential pipeline investments, \nADB will engage human resources to strengthen the company\u2019s capacity to meet ADB\u2019s eligibility \nrequirements. At least 20% of initiatives supported by this TA will be (partly) owned by nationals \nof the local FCAS or SIDS. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Design  elements  that  advance  gender  equality,  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \noperational priority 2, incorporated into investments. When appropriate, ADB will engage \nconsultants to incorporate gender components into activities being undertaken by private sector \ncompanies. \n \n13.  Output 3: Design elements that advance climate change components, in line with \nADB\u2019s operational priority 3, incorporated into investments. When appropriate, ADB will \nengage consultants to incorporate climate change components into activities being undertaken \nby private sector companies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \nBecause of the smaller markets of FCAS and SIDS, the average investment size is expected to \nbe considerably less than what is traditionally invested in larger DMCs, and the clients\u2019 ability to \npay the costs associated with ADB\u2019s requirements is considerably reduced.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. In the spirit of the \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach, ADB will reach across \nthe  institution  to  bring  together  the  knowledge  and  expertise  required  for  successful \nimplementation of the TA. In turn, the TA will help expand the private investment necessary to \ngrow FCAS and SIDS DMC economies. ADB\u2019s PSOD will be responsible for identifying potential \nactivities to be conducted under the TA and for selecting, supervising, and evaluating consultants \nand procuring any goods deemed necessary. ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel will be \nresponsible for selecting, supervising, and evaluating any legal assistance engaged under the TA. \nFCAS focal persons in ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department and \nPacific  Departments  and  ADB\u2019s  NGO  Center,  will  provide  guidance,  as  needed.
