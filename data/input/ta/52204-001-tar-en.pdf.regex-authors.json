INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognizes the distinct development \nchallenges of fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCAS) and small island developing states \n(SIDS), and promotes a differentiated approach to these groups of developing member countries \n(DMCs).1 Under Strategy 2030, ADB will prioritize its support by providing long-term financing and \ncapacity-development assistance to help build resilience and address causes of fragility or \nconflict.2 The differentiated approach under ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 will build on ADB\u2019s long-\nstanding support for development in FCAS, which emphasizes the importance of understanding \nthe local context, making a long-term commitment to development, ensuring country ownership, \nand being flexible in responding to challenges.3 \n \n2.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  improving  the \ndevelopment effectiveness and sustainability of ADB operations in fragile situations to help build \nresilience and address the causes of fragility in the Pacific. It will build on the research and \ncapacity-development activities delivered under previous FCAS TA projects, and lessons from \ntheir implementation. Through a series of country assessments, the TA will map out sources of \nfragility in FCAS countries and identify issues and constraints in the project cycle, including \nprocurement. Based on these assessments as well as a review of ongoing and completed projects, \nthe TA will determine practical measures to improve future approaches, such as using a single \nconsultant  for  individual  projects,  climate-proofing  infrastructure,  and  including  dedicated \noperation and maintenance (O&M) funding.4 The TA will also facilitate capacity-building and \ninstitutional-strengthening activities that respond to the specific needs of fragile situations and \nhelp build resilience. A flagship knowledge-sharing event on fragility-sensitive approaches to \ndevelopment in the Pacific will provide for an exchange of experiences, lessons, and best \npractices. \n \n3.  A concept paper for this TA, with a budget of $500,000 from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial  Fund  (TASF  6),  was  approved  on  31  August  2018.5 The  TA  is  in  line  with  the \nimplementation priorities of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020 and is included in ADB\u2019s regional \noperations business plan, Pacific 2019\u20132021.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  ADB has been expanding its assistance to fragile situations in the Pacific, all of which are \nSIDS. The active portfolio for the current Pacific FCAS countries has grown from $647 million in \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila \n(July). ADB follows the United Nations definition of SIDS, which defines SIDS as all states that participate in the \nAlliance of Small Island States. Therefore, all 14 Pacific ADB DMCs are classified as SIDS. \n2  As of June 2018, nine DMCs are classified by ADB as FCAS, two of which are affected by conflict (Afghanistan and \nMyanmar), while the remaining seven are Pacific SIDS and demonstrate the effects of fragility: Kiribati, the Marshall \nIslands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Tuvalu. Additionally, \nboth Timor-Leste and Vanuatu had country performance assessment scores just slightly above the 3.2 cutoff for \nFCAS, and ADB\u2019s operations in these countries continue to pay due attention to issues of fragility. \n3  ADB. 2013. Operational Plan for Enhancing ADB\u2019s Effectiveness in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations. Manila; \nand ADB. 2013. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. \nManila. \n4  The potential application of ADB\u2019s new financial products and instruments in FCAS countries will be assessed. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 September 2018. \n6  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020. Manila; ADB. 2018; Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific 2019\u2013\n2021. Manila.  \n ", "2 \n2010 to $1,57 billion at the end of 2017.7 ADB has strengthened the capacity of implementing and \nexecuting agencies on fragility-sensitive approaches to project development and implementation, \nincluding through TA support.8 Pacific initiatives such as the Pacific Project Improvement Action \nPlan, which was implemented as part of Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020, have helped improve \nproject performance and deliver better results, including by strengthening project readiness and \nincreasing implementation support. These efforts, combined with simplified business processes, \nhave produced some encouraging results. For example, the share of infrastructure projects that \nwere procurement-ready at approval in fragile situations increased from 0% in 2015 to 50% in \n2016, and 67% in 2017.9 \n \n5.  Despite some positive signs, success rates of projects in fragile situations in the Pacific \nremain considerably lower than ADB\u2019s overall project success rates; 64% of completed projects \nin fragile situations were rated successful during the 2014\u20132017 period, while 75% of all ADB \nsovereign projects were rated successful during the same period.10 Ensuring that the outputs and \noutcomes of ADB-financed operations in fragile situations are sustainable remains a critical \nchallenge, with only 53% of completed projects rated likely sustainable during the 2014\u20132017 \nperiod. The performance of ongoing projects in fragile situations was also significantly lower than \nthe ADB average, with 61% of projects in fragile situations rated on track compared with the ADB \naverage of 73% as of 2017. The main cause of poor project performance is limited government \ncapacity for project design, implementation, and O&M. Challenges related to limited government \ncapacity, both in terms of number of staff and their skills, are common to most Pacific fragile \nsituations.11 Furthermore, ADB\u2019s business processes and requirements are not always suitable \nor practical for fragile situations. \n \n6.  Improving  ADB\u2019s  development  effectiveness  in  fragile  situations  requires  a  detailed \nunderstanding of the sources of fragility and a differentiated approach, with new and innovative \nsolutions that help build resilience. Traditional approaches to building capacity and strengthening \ninstitutions have had mixed success, while standard business processes limit the ability to adapt \nproject design, implementation, and O&M arrangements to the special needs of fragile situations \nin the Pacific. The suitability of new approaches\u2014such as using a single consultant for individual \nprojects and including dedicated O&M funding, which are being implemented on a pilot basis in \nthe Pacific\u2014needs to be further assessed for fragile situations. Increased collaboration with other \ndevelopment partners in the Pacific is also needed when working in fragile situations. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  effectiveness  and  sustainability  of \ndevelopment results in fragile situations in the Pacific increased.12 The TA will have the following \n                                                \n7  For all FCAS-related computations, this concept paper uses the 2018 grouping of seven Pacific countries currently \nclassified as FCAS (footnote 2). \n8  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Mapping Resilience to Fragility and Conflict in Asia and the Pacific. Manila; and \nADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Building Project Implementation in the Pacific. Manila. \n9  Project design advances, results-based loans, and policy-based loans are excluded from the computation. There \nwere two infrastructure projects in ADB DMCs in the Pacific classified as FCAS approved in 2015, four in 2016, and \nthree in 2017. \n10  ADB. 2018. 2017 Development Effectiveness Review. Manila; estimates are based on the success rates of \ncompleted operations in DMCs classified as FCAS in 2017, validated by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department. \n11 Fragile situations in the Pacific are characterized by low institutional capacity, and often a state\u2019s weak capacity to \ncarry out the basic functions of governing; their small and remote nature; and their vulnerability to climate change \nand economic, environmental, and disaster-related shocks. \n12 Defined by the TA. \n ", "3 \noutcome: design, implementation, and O&M of ADB-financed operations in fragile situations \nimproved.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Fragility assessments and project reviews in fragile situations conducted \nand findings shared. The TA will map out the root causes of fragility in FCAS countries in the \nPacific, assess current responses by governments and ADB, and propose new solutions. By \nfocusing on specific aspects of the project cycle, such as procurement policies and practices, new \napproaches  and  guidelines  will  be  tailored  to  the  unique  circumstances  found  in  fragile \nsituations.14 The  assessments  will  also  consider  how  ADB  practices  and  approaches  can \ncontribute to reducing gender inequality. The TA will support reviews of current and completed \noperations to identify approaches that have or have not worked well in fragile situations, and \ndetermine more suitable alternatives. The findings from such assessments and reviews will be \nused as inputs for capacity-development and institutional-strengthening activities that reflect new \nprocesses and practices for working in fragile situations. Assessment findings, training materials, \nand guidelines will be disseminated using a range of media, including printed brochures and \nonline videos. The TA will also provide direct support to ongoing projects to develop fragility-\nsensitive solutions to problems that are encountered. \n \n9.  Output 2: Capacity building and institutional strengthening on fragility-sensitive \napproaches to development conducted. The TA will support capacity-building activities for \ngovernment  officials  and  development  practitioners,  including  ADB  staff,  to  gain  a  deeper \nunderstanding of issues and challenges when engaging in fragile situations and practical solutions \nto  addressing  these  challenges.  The  TA  will  also  facilitate  the  preparation  of  institutional-\nstrengthening and capacity-building plans. The capacity-building and institutional-strengthening \nactivities will be implemented in collaboration with other bilateral and multilateral development \npartners in the Pacific and will include lessons from their work. To overcome the logistical and \nresource constraints of reaching out to more participants, ADB will update and develop online \nlearning  courses  that  cater  to  different  knowledge  levels  and  provide  on-demand  learning \nopportunities. To facilitate more coordinated approaches to working in fragile situations and better \nsharing of experiences, the TA will also support the organization of a flagship event on fragility-\nsensitive approaches to development in the Pacific. This event will bring together representatives \nof DMCs, bilateral and multilateral development partners; and will build on the momentum of the \nADB Annual Meeting 2019 in Fiji. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. The TA will cover the travel costs of ADB staff acting as resource persons for seminars and \nworkshops. The funds for this TA might be replenished during implementation subject to demand \nfor the TA activities. \n \n11.  The governments of participating DMCs will make relevant country data available; will \nnominate participants to join capacity-building activities and meetings related to this TA; will \nvalidate  TA  deliverables,  such  as  country  and  progress  reports;  and  may  provide  in-kind \ncontributions. \n                                                \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n14 ADB. 2018.

ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will administer and \nimplement the TA. Because of the complexities and risks inherent in the operating environments \nfound in fragile situations, the TA will be implemented over a 39-month period, from 1 December \n2018 to 28 February 2022. The TA will support (i) fragility needs assessments, focusing on the \nspecific areas of project cycles, country needs assessments that map the root causes of fragility, \nand  project  reviews;  and  (ii)  the  development  of  e-learning  courses  on  fragility-sensitive \napproaches  to  development,  capacity-building  and  institutional-strengthening  activities,  and \norganization of a flagship event on fragility-sensitive approaches to development in the Pacific. \n \n13.  The TA will disseminate knowledge through various platforms. To ensure continuous \nlearning on fragility-sensitive approaches, e-learning courses will be developed to provide on-\ndemand learning opportunities. These courses may be hosted on existing ADB platforms for \nonline learning to ensure that they remain accessible following TA closure. In collaboration with \nADB\u2019s  Department  of  Communications,  the  outputs  of  country  needs  and  fragility  needs \nassessments will be disseminated through various channels, depending on the target audience. \nAll outputs will be made freely available to the public through ADB's corporate website. Limited \ncopies will be produced for general dissemination and targeted workshops in headquarters, \nrepresentative offices, and resident missions. \n \n14.  The TA will require a total of 32 person-months of intermittent individual consultant \nservices,  including  12  person-months  of  international  and  20  person-months  of  national \nconsultant services. Consultant inputs will be required to conduct research and assessments, \ndraft  brochures,  and  prepare  and  deliver  capacity-building  and  institutional-strengthening \nactivities, including online training modules. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  1 December 2018\u2013February 2022 \nExecuting agency  ADB\u2019s Pacific Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant system  32 person-months  $ 340,000 \nProcurement  Not applicable \nNot applicable \nAdvance contracting and  Not applicable \nretroactive financing \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Not applicable. \narrangement upon TA completion \nADB= Asian Development Bank, TA= technical assistance. \nSources: Strategy, Policy and Review Department, approved TA concept paper, and ADB estimates. \n \n15.

To ensure accessibility of the learning courses beyond the \nTA completion date, ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will explore hosting the proposed e-learning \ncourses within learning management system maintained by the Knowledge Sharing and Services \nCenter under ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. ADB makes \nlearning courses on select development topics available to external participants on its k-Learn \nand Development Asia websites. The site provides online courses on various sector and thematic \nareas as part of ADB\u2019s work to share knowledge in the region. ADB\u2019s Pacific Department will work \nwith the Knowledge Sharing and Services Center\u2019s team of e-learning specialists to update and \nmanage the content of the courses. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nTowards Effective and Sustainable Delivery of Development Results in Fragile Situations in the \nPacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nEffectiveness and sustainability of development results in fragile situations in the Pacific increaseda \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nDesign,  a.
