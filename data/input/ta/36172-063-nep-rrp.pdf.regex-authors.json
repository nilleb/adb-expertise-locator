THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \ngrant; (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of the United \nKingdom  both  for  the  Strengthening  Public  Management  Program;  and  (iii)  proposed \nadministration of a technical assistance (TA) to be provided by the Government of the United \nKingdom for Supporting the Strengthening Public Management Program. If the Board approves \nthe proposed grant, administration of grant, and TA grant, I, acting under the authority delegated \nto me by the Board, will approve the Asian Development Bank (ADB) providing the balance for \nthe TA. \n \n2.  The  program  seeks  to  promote  an  enabling  environment  in  Nepal  for  the  effective \ndelivery of public goods and services, especially at the local level. It will do this by strengthening \nnational and local linkages in public financial management (PFM), mitigating fiduciary risks \nthrough greater transparency and public participation, modernizing procurement systems, and \nenhancing the effectiveness of oversight and accountability agencies. The program will support \nefforts by the government of Nepal to reform budget, fiscal, and fiduciary risk management at \nthe sub-national or local government level (district development committee [DDC], municipality \nand  village  development  committee  [VDC]),  public  procurement,  and  oversight  and \naccountability  institutions  at  the  national  level.1 The  program  is  aligned  with  ADB\u2019s  Nepal \ncountry  partnership  strategy  for  2010\u20132012  and  is  part  of  a  broader  set  of  fiduciary  risk \nreduction initiatives being implemented by other development partners in Nepal, notably the \nPFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Nepal\u2019s complex and protracted political transition. Nepal is continuing a difficult \ntransition to democracy following the end of a decade-long civil conflict in April 2006. Given the \ndeep ideological, social, and economic divisions that propelled the conflict, this transition has \nbeen complex and sometimes halting. It is currently at an impasse and faces major challenges. \nThe country failed to approve a new constitution before a deadline on 27 May 2012, the \nconstituent assembly was subsequently dissolved, and the need for new assembly elections \nhave combined to prolong the transition period. This has increased political uncertainty but it \nalso presents opportunities to promote reforms and help the government shape the transition.  \n \n4.  Nepal\u2019s binding constraints. Several analyses have pointed to weak governance as a \nkey  constraint  to  the  post-conflict  economic  recovery  of  Nepal  and  its  further  growth  and \ndevelopment.3 The country ranks below the South Asian average on all six of the World Bank\u2019s \ngovernance indicators.4 Poor governance persists largely because of the highly fragmented and \noften polarized political landscape, which makes it difficult to form durable governing coalitions \nthat can focus on long-term public needs. The fragility of political coalitions consequently tends \nto foster government and management based on short-term political calculations rather than the \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2009. Nepal: Critical Development Constraints. Manila. \n4  Nepal\u2019s rankings in five of the six indicators declined continuously from 1996 to 2007. The exception was its \nposition in regulatory quality index, which improved marginally over the period from the 22.9 to 26.7 percentile. Its \nscores place Nepal in the bottom quartile of the World Bank\u2019s global rankings. See World Bank governance \nindicators at www.govindicators.org. ", "2 \npublic interest to keep the coalitions intact. Partisan battles frequently dominate and distort \npublic policy making and bureaucratic leadership.  \n \n5.  Nepal\u2019s acute economic challenges. Nepal continues to have the weakest performing \neconomy in South Asia. Its per capita gross national income in 2011 was estimated at $540 (in \ncurrent prices), compared with $770 for Bangladesh, $1,410 for India, $2,580 for Sri Lanka, \n$2,070 for Bhutan, and $6,530 for the Maldives.5 Nepal\u2019s economy grew by 4.6% in FY2012, up \nfrom 3.8% in FY2011, mainly due to growth in the agriculture and service sectors and increased \nremittance inflows.6 While the incidence of poverty has declined, 25% of the country\u2019s people \nstill live below the national poverty line as of 2011. Income inequality is also high and the Gini \ncoefficient for the country stood at 0.35 in 2011.7 \n \n1.  Assessment of Nepal\u2019s Public Financial Management System \n \n6.  Gaps in Nepal\u2019s public financial management system at the national level. Results \nof a public expenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment conducted in 2008 \nillustrated the weak state of governance in Nepal. The country scored an A on only 1 of the 31 \nPEFA indicators (budget credibility) and a B on only 3. It was given a C on 8 indicators, C+ on 9, \nD+ on 7, and D (the lowest grade) on 3.8 Although some budget and fiscal management \nindicators  scored  relatively  well,  the  assessment  points  to  poor  performance  in  budget \nclassification,  transparency  of  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  oversight  of  fiscal  risks  of \npublic sector entities, and the extent of unreported government operations. The PEFA results \nwere echoed in a country fiduciary risk assessment (FRA) by the Department for International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom (DFID) in 2008.9 This led the Government of Nepal to \nacknowledge the challenges posed by its \u201chigh fiduciary risk environment.\u201d10  \n \n7.  Weaknesses  in  Nepal\u2019s  public  financial  management  system  at  the  local \ngovernment level. An unofficial study of local financial governance in 2006 indicated that PFM \ndeficiencies at the national level are mirrored at the local government level. Although the sample \nof this study at the local government level was neither comprehensive nor representative, the \nfindings raised serious concerns. 11 No local government body scored an A, 33% were rated B, \n50% received a C, and 17% a D. These low ratings were based on such PFM shortcomings as \nineffective internal audits, overpayments, payment without adequate supporting documents, \nexceeding administrative expense limits, weakness in procurement and management of assets \nand inventory, and expenditures that lacked proper approval. \n \n8.  Budget and fiscal management issues at the local government level. Budget and \nfiscal management at the local government level is afflicted by numerous problems. Budget \npreparation is done without participation by the public because local government councils are \nnot elected and are run by civil servants and transitional \u201call-party\u201d mechanisms.  Internal audits \nare irregular and of poor quality due to the absence of qualified staff and poor controls, and both \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2012.

Kathmandu (May, p. 2). \n11 The sample consisted of 5 districts out of 75, 10 VDCs out of 3,915, and 3 municipalities out of 58. \n ", "3 \nthe  reporting  and  monitoring  of  audit  findings  are  inadequate.  Transfers  from  the  central \ngovernment for the capital components of budgets are unpredictable and often delayed or \nreduced, leading to postponement of projects and undermining local government planning.  \nPoor costing of capital expenditure and asset maintenance is compounded by a lack of output \nand outcome orientation in budgets. Failure to cost services results in poor cost recovery, \nparticularly  in  education  and  health,  the  two  sectors  that  account  for  a  majority  of  local \ngovernment spending. The revenues collected by municipalities, which have the most scope \namong local governments for fiscal autonomy, fall well below actual potential because property \nrecords are incomplete, houses often lack even a proper address, and tax rates are out of date.  \n \n9.  Public  procurement  problems.  Sound  public  procurement  plays  a  central  part  in \neffective PFM but the problems with government procurement in Nepal, where it consumes up \nto 80% of the national budget, are severe. Nepal received a C for competition, value for money, \nand controls in the 2008 PEFA assessment (para. 6), which showed little improvement since a \nWorld Bank country procurement assessment report in 2002.12 A joint working group of the \ngovernment, ADB, DFID, and the World Bank formed in 2008 found the Public Procurement Act \nhad major gaps and was ineffectively enforced. Collusion, intimidation, and other bad practices \nhad been growing, especially at the local level.13 In January 2012, ADB and the World Bank \nconducted a joint procurement review with the Public Procurement Monitoring Office (PPMO). \nThe review confirmed earlier findings and raised concerns about devolution of procurement \nbecause the capacity to carry it out at local levels remains practically nonexistent.14 \n \n10.  Major accountability and oversight issues. The 2009 Global Integrity Report on Nepal \nshows  a  very  large  gap  between  the  laws  and  policies  on  accountability  and  actual \nimplementation.  Nepal  ranks  154th  on  Transparency  International\u2019s  2011  Corruption \nPerceptions Index. Long-standing leadership vacuums in accountability agencies, notably the \nCommission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) and the Office of the Auditor \nGeneral, prevent Nepal from addressing its governance problems squarely. The government\u2019s \nNational Vigilance Centre (NVC) remains institutionally weak. Nepal\u2019s laws and regulations to \ncombat corruption have large loopholes not only in practice but also on paper. For example, the \nCIAA  has  no  jurisdiction  over  the  judiciary,  the  military,  or  the  private  sector.  With  few \ninvestigations and convictions of corrupt high-level officials, corruption in Nepal has become a \nlow-risk, high-reward activity.15 \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s Public Financial Management Reform Program \n \n11.  Government initiatives to address public financial management problems at the \nnational level. The government developed a public financial management reform program for \n2009\u20132012 that focused on six areas: tax collection, budget formulation, budget execution, \naccounting and reporting, external audit, and institutional capacity (footnote 10). Its  taxation \nreforms, institutionalization of a medium-term expenditure framework to link policies to budgets, \ninternal and external audits, establishment of a treasury single account, procurement reform, \nand  strengthening  of  the  PEFA  secretariat  are  at  different  stages of  implementation.  With \nrespect  to  public  procurement,  the  government  formulated  and  implemented  the  Public \nProcurement Strategic Framework Phase 1, 2010\u20132013 (footnote 13). \n \n                                                 \n12 World Bank. 2002.

Government reforms to tackle public financial management issues at the local \ngovernment level. The government\u2019s local governance and capacity development program \n(LGCDP) for 2008\u20132014 has spearheaded local governance reforms.16 ADB, through its Nepal \nGovernance Support Program,17 supported the LGCDP under a joint financing arrangement with \nfive other development partners.18 The LGCDP has become an important national program for \nreducing  poverty  and  tackling  social  exclusion.  It  established  a  framework  to  consolidate \nfragmented donor assistance and streamlined fiscal transfers to local government bodies. This \nhas led to improved local service delivery even in difficult areas. To guard against fiduciary risks, \nthe LGCDP supported social mobilization activities to empower community-level groups such as \nward  citizen  forums  and  citizen  action  centers  to  participate  in  local  government  decision \nmaking and make up for the absence of local elected officials. This approach was coupled with \noutcome-based monitoring to hold local governments accountable, notably through a framework \nof minimum conditions and performance measures (MC&PM) for DDCs. \n \n13.  Emergence of fiduciary risks in local governance. The midterm report on the LGCDP \nfound fiduciary risks in its implementation.19 An FRA of local governance conducted in response \nby ADB and its development partners20 found a lack of transparency and political interference in \nbudget allocations, poor accounting and reporting, noncompliance with procurement regulations, \nand the absence of internal and external audits. Development partners also financed a public \nexpenditure  tracking  survey  (PETS)  of  the  LGCDP  to  better  understand  the  sources  and \nseverity of fiduciary risks. The findings reflected the results of the FRA.21 A focused evaluation \nof the LGCDP by the Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development (MOFALD) in July 2012 \ncalled  for  new  policies  to  reduce  fiduciary  risks. 22  Just  as  important  as  the  fiduciary \nshortcomings is the fact that central government policies are not enforced and, therefore, not \ncredible and local stakeholders lack incentives to implement them.   \n \n14.  The government\u2019s response to fiduciary risks. The MOFALD approved a fiduciary \nrisk reduction action plan (FRRAP) in March 2012 to respond to the findings on the problem \n(para. 13). The FRRAP reflects lessons learned from implementing the LGCDP, notably the \nimportance of strengthening PFM systems at the local level, ensuring results-oriented capacity \nbuilding in PFM in local government bodies, and bolstering social mobilization approaches.23 By \nfocusing on local governance reforms, the FRRAP complements national-level PFM reforms \nbeing supported by the PFM Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF).24 \n                                                 \n16 Government of Nepal. 2008.

Mobilization of multilateral and bilateral support for the government\u2019s reforms. \nADB mobilized additional resources to cofinance the program and support the government\u2019s \nwide-ranging PFM reforms. It has secured cofinancing from DFID of $6.5 million equivalent. A \nseparate  cofinancing  proposal  for  \u20ac4.5  million  by  the  European  Union  (EU)  is  also  being \ndiscussed. Because the EU decision may not be made until December 2012, only the DFID \ncontribution is reflected in this Report and Recommendation of the President. The program has \nreceived strong endorsement by the local governance donor group and the PFM donor group \nco-chaired by the EU and the World Bank. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n16.  The  program\u2019s  expected  impact  will  be  more  effective  delivery  of  public  goods  and \nservices in Nepal, especially at the local government  level. The intended outcome is enhanced \nefficiency, transparency, and integrity of public finances at the national and sub-national levels. \n \nC.  Outputs \n17.  The  program  outputs  will  be  (i)  improved  local  government  budget  and  fiscal \nmanagement, (ii) strengthened fiduciary risk management at the local government level, (iii) an \nenhanced  public  procurement  system,  and  (iv)  strengthened  oversight  and  accountability \ninstitutions. These outputs will be achieved through four component sets of activities. A policy \nmatrix of policy actions that serve as performance triggers for disbursements is in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Component 1: Local government budget and fiscal management. The program will \nsupport government efforts to foster more effective local government budget and expenditure \nmanagement  and  fiscal  sustainability.  These  reforms  include  (i)  strengthening  participatory \nplanning processes to help enforce implementation of local governance guidelines, including \nallocation of block grants and funding for women, children, and disadvantaged groups; (ii) \nintroducing performance-based grants for VDCs; (iii) enhancing timely budget disbursements to \nlocal governments by applying a medium-term budget framework for DDCs and municipalities; \n(v) institutionalizing results-based management for local governments through the development \nof a results framework and the introduction of annual performance plans for local officials; and \n(vi)  enhancing  revenue  management  of  municipalities  through  the  piloting  of  a  municipal \nadministration revenue system (MARS) to increase their ability to raise their own revenues and \nto improve tax compliance by better application of incentives and penalties. \n \n19.  Component 2:  Fiduciary risk management at the local government level. The \nprogram will support government reforms to reduce fiduciary risks and strengthen safeguards in \nlocal governance. These reforms include (i) strengthening local government accounting systems \nthrough  computerization  of  accounting  systems  in  DDCs,  municipalities,  and  VDCs;  (ii) \nimproving  management  and  accountability  of  user  groups  through  public  auditing;  (iii) \nstrengthening  civic  oversight  through  capacity  building  of  ward  citizen  forums  and  citizen \nawareness centers, as well as adoption of guidelines on public and social audits; (iv) enhancing \ntransparency  in  local  governance  through  development  of  websites  that  will  disclose  local \ngovernment  revenues  and  expenditures;  (v)  reinforcing  oversight  mechanisms  of  MOFALD \nthrough support for its good governance unit; and (vi) strengthening external and internal audits \n                                                                                                                                                          \ncapacity building for the Office of the Auditor General, (iii) the fostering of demand-side capacity building, (iv) \nresearch on implementation of audit recommendations, and (v) a PETS of the education sector. \n ", "6 \nof local governments through the formulation and implementation of auditing guidelines and \ndevelopment of an audit clearance tracking system. \n \n20.  Component  3:  Public  procurement  reform. The program will support government \nefforts to increase safeguards in public procurement by making it more transparent, competitive, \nand efficient. It will specifically support public procurement reforms at the local level proposed in \nthe FRRAP. These include the establishment of procurement units in DDCs and municipalities, \nthe  development  of  annual  procurement  plans  in  local  governments,  the  preparation  and \nimplementation  of  procurement  master  plans  for  local  governments,  the  development  of \nstandard bidding documents in Nepali for procurement at the VDC level, and capacity building \nof  procurement  staff  in  DDCs  and  municipalities.  Support  for  the  development  of  an  e-\ngovernment procurement (e-GP) system will be provided through the program\u2019s associated TA. \n \n21.  Component 4: Oversight and accountability capacity building. The program will \nsupport the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen its oversight and accountability functions. The \nprogram will support the government\u2019s National Strategy against Corruption 2012, including the \nAnti-Corruption Strategy and Work Plan of the NVC. It will also help the NVC strengthen its \ntechnical audit capacity and expand its corruption prevention tools. The program\u2019s associated \nTA will support the development of a corruption vulnerability diagnostic instrument that can be \nused to assess the corruption risks and safeguards of public investment projects. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n22.  The total adjustment cost of the program is estimated at $30 million (excluding TA costs). \nThe estimated adjustment costs are in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Program Adjustment Costs \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nComponent 1: Local government budget and fiscal management  7.00 \nComponent 2: Local government fiduciary risk management  18.00 \nComponent 3: Public procurement reform  3.00 \nComponent 4: Oversight and accountability capacity-building  2.00 \n    Total  30.00 \nSources: Asian Development Bank and Government of Nepal estimates. \n \n23.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $21 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the program. The government has also requested a grant \nequivalent to $4 million from the Government of the United Kingdom to help finance part of the \nprogram. This grant will be administered by ADB. The government will finance the remaining \nprogram cost of $5 million from its own budget.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n24.  The PEFA steering committee will be the steering committee for and will provide policy \nguidance to the program. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the program executing agency \nand will be responsible for the overall implementation of the program, including compliance with \nall policy actions, facility administration, disbursements and maintenance of records. The MOF \nwill receive support from the PEFA Secretariat, which will serve as the PMU, and provide: (i) \ntechnical  guidance  to  the  Implementing  Agencies,  (ii)  periodically  review  the  progress  of \nprogram  implementation,  and  (iii)  ensure  coordination  of  the  program  with  other  reform \n ", "7 \ninitiatives.  MOFALD,  PPMO  and  NVC  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  MOFALD  will \nimplement components 1 and 2 of the program, PPMO will implement component 3 of the \nprogram and NVC will implement component 4 of the program. PPMO and NVC, respectively, \nwill  establish  a  PCU  to  implement  their  respective  components.  The  existing  program \ncoordination unit for LGCDP in MOFALD shall serve as the PCU for MOFALD. Each PCU will \nhave  a  manager  and  will:  (i)  supervise  implementation  of  activities  under  their  respective \ncomponent, (ii) prepare and submit progress reports to the program executing agency and PMU, \nand (iii) liaise with the PEFA Secretariat in the implementation of the program.  \n \n25.  The program will be implemented over 3 years from November 2012 to October 2015. \nThe grant proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification \nof Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.25  The proceeds \nwill finance the foreign exchange costs, excluding taxes and duties, of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries and exclude items on the list of ineligible items and imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. No supporting import documentation will be \nrequired if, during each year that grant proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of \nNepal\u2019s  total  imports  minus  imports  from  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and \ndisbursements made under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during such year. The government will certify its compliance \nwith  this  formula  in  each  withdrawal  request.  Other  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of grant proceeds and verify \nthe accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. The implementation arrangements are in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  November 2012\u2013October 2015 \nEstimated completion date  October 2015 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  PEFA steering committee (Secretary of Finance, Chair)  \n(ii)   Executing agency  Ministry of Finance \n(iii)   Key implementing  Ministry of Federal Affairs and Local Development, Public Procurement \nagencies  Monitoring Office, National Vigilance Centre \nDisbursement   The $25 million policy-based grant will be disbursed in two tranches. \nTranche 1, in the amount of $11.9 million, will be disbursed upon grant \neffectiveness.

TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n26.  ADB will provide a capacity development TA for Supporting the Strengthening Public \nManagement Program to help the government achieve the policy reforms outlined in the policy \nmatrix. The TA will also support the development and pilot implementation of MARS and the e-\nGP system. The TA project will have the same intended impact and outcome as the project, \nwhich are to be achieved through the following outputs: \n \n27.  Output 1: Key public financial management diagnostic tools. The TA will support \nthe implementation of key activities in the policy matrix. This will include two public expenditure \ntracking surveys\u2014the first at midterm and the second towards the end of the program\u2014and a \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n ", "8 \nPEFA assessment at the local government level that preferably will be undertaken at the same \ntime as a national PEFA assessment. The TA will also support the development of a framework \nof MC&PM for VDCs. 26 The TA will help the PMU (FCGO) coordinate these activities. \n \n28.  Output 2: Municipal administration revenue system. The TA will develop MARS and \npilot it in at least one municipality. The MARS will enable municipalities to raise more of their \nown revenues, particularly from such sources as the house and land tax and the integrated \nproperty tax. By establishing an electronic database of taxable houses and land and taxpayers, \nMARS  will  widen  the  municipal  tax  base  and  enhance  tax  compliance.  The  revenue \nmanagement and financial planning module of MARS will be designed to exchange data with \nthe government\u2019s integrated financial management information system. \n \n29.  Output 3: E-government procurement system. Building on the current ADB TA to the  \nPPMO, the  TA  will  develop  a  full-fledged  e-GP  system  to  cover  all  aspects  of  the  public \nprocurement cycle and will support the rollout of the e-submission module of e-GP to at least \neight  ministries.27 The  complete  e-GP  system  to  be  developed  will  include  electronic  bid \nevaluation,  contract  award,  contract  administration,  and  payments;  creation  of  online \ncatalogues; and measures for enabling procurement performance analysis and auditing. The TA \nwill also help develop e-GP training modules. \n \n30.  The TA will be implemented together with the program through three consulting services \npackages. Package 1 will support attainment of key policy actions, notably the PETS and the \nPEFA surveys, and the formulation of the MC&PM framework. Packages 2 and 3 will be for the \ndevelopment of MARS and e-GP system, respectively, and will include procurement of hardware \nand software. Due to the highly technical nature of these activities, the firm recruitment will use the \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  with  a  standard  quality-cost  ratio  of  90:10.  All \nconsultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). All procurement of goods and services will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). At the end of the TA, all equipment procured \nwill be retained by the government. All disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).28 \n \n31.  The cost of the TA is  estimated at the equivalent of $3,000,000.29 The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) in the amount \nof $500,000, and cofinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom in an amount equivalent \nto $2,500,000, to be administered by ADB. Additional cofinancing has been sought from the EU \nthat, if approved, will be utilized to expand the scope of the TA to support public procurement \ncapacity building and other PFM reforms (paras. 27\u201329). 30 \n                                                 \n26 The program will also draw on the United Nations Capital Development Fund\u2019s work on accrual accounting, \nstrengthening of expenditure reporting, studies on block grant guidelines, and formula-based grant allocations. \n27 The  TA  will  build  on  the  small-scale  TA  on  Strengthening  Public  Procurement  Management  and  Portfolio \nPerformance being implemented by ADB\u2019s Nepal Resident Mission. TA 7752 \n28 The TA packages, implementation schedule, and budget are in the Technical Assistance for Supporting the Public \nManagement Reform Program: Terms of Reference and Cost Estimates (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n29 Technical Assistance for Supporting the Strengthening Public Management Program: Terms of Reference and \nCost Estimates (accessible from the list of limited documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 Subject to EU parliamentary approval, the EU Delegation to Nepal has indicated it can provide co-financing of \u20ac4.5 \nmillion for the TA. In the event this co-financing is approved, the scale of the Program and TA will be expanded as \nfollows: (i) expansion of e-GP rollout to 1 or 2 additional other ministries and agencies; (ii) greater coverage of \npublic procurement capacity building; (iii) MARS rollout to 1 other municipality and additional training on MARS; \nand (iv) implementation of additional internal audit capacity building and support for the FCGO\u2019s PMU functions. \n ", "9 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n32.  The highly technical components of the program pertain to the MARS and e-GP systems. \nA two-step assessment was conducted for these activities. The first was an as-is analysis of the \nissues facing municipal finance and public procurement. The second was a to-be analysis for \nthe proposed interventions, including scope of work, timing, and costing. The program drew on \nthe findings of the third ADB\u2013World Bank procurement review mission completed in March 2012. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n33.  The main benefits from component 1 will be improved management of central transfers \nto local governments and enhanced ability of local governments - municipalities using MARS in \nparticular - to mobilize their own revenues.31 Benefits under component 2 will be a reduction in \nfinancial irregularities and improvements in public service delivery as a result of improved \naccounting  systems  and  results-based  management.  Wider  public  participation  in  local \ngovernment budgeting and accounting, and more effective auditing will also reduce irregularities. \nComponent 3 benefits will be expenditure savings of about $20 million per year from lower costs, \nbetter pricing, and higher quality goods and services due to more competitive and transparent \npublic  procurement.  Benefits  under  component  4  will  come  in  the  form  of  a  reduction  of \ngovernment arrears of about $7 million annually. Overall, these benefits strongly justify program \ncosts. Moreover, the increased stream of municipal revenues and cost savings will strengthen \nfiscal positions at both national and local levels and incentivize further reforms. \n \nC.   Governance \n \n34.  A  governance  risk  assessment  in  line  with  ADB's  Second  Governance  and \nAnticorruption Action Plan was carried out.32 The assessment complements studies by the DFID \nand the World Bank. The government unveiled a PFM reform program in 2009 and developed a \npublic procurement strategy framework in July 2010. The government has passed the following \nanti-corruption legislation: the Good Governance Act of 2008, the Right to Information Act of \n2007, the Public Procurement Act of 2007, and the Anti-Money-Laundering Act of 2008. A risk \nassessment  and  risk  management  plan  has  been  developed  for  the  program  to  mitigate \ngovernance risks.33 In addition, ADB\u2019s Anticorruption and Policy (1998, as amended to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The program will benefit poor and marginalized groups, including women and children. \nLocal government budget and fiscal management reforms will ensure more timely and reliable \nfiscal transfers of funds to support gender empowerment and social inclusion (GESI) objectives. \nA key policy action of the program will be to demonstrate implementation of earmarked funding \nfor GESI activities according to the government\u2019s guidelines\u201415% for disadvantaged groups, \n                                                 \n31 A base case scenario of revenue gains in a medium-sized municipality shows an increase of $8 million\u2013$11 million \non a cumulative basis in the first 5 years after introduction of MARS. This is based on an assumption of an annual \n5% increase in the number of houses registered and an increase in the tax compliance rate from the current level \nof 30% to around 90% in 5 years. Also see Financial and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.

Downward  accountability  mechanisms  in  budget \npreparation will ensure that local projects are aligned with GESI goals. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n36.  The program\u2019s reforms do not involve physical construction activities and an adverse \nimpact on the environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples is unlikely. The \nprogram is thus classified as category C in all three of ADB\u2019s safeguard areas.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n37.  The governance risk assessment carried out for ADB\u2019s Nepal CPS 2010\u20132012 identified \nrisks in PFM, procurement, and corruption. Mitigating measures to address these risks are \noutlined in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 33). In addition, to guard \nagainst procurement risks in program implementation, it is ADB through the TA that will conduct \nthe procurement for the e-GP and MARS systems. With respect to consultants who will be \nengaged by MOFALD, ADB will be consulted in their selection. This consultation is not required \nunder the program modality but it has been added as a risk mitigating measure. Finally, ADB \nand its development partners are regularly engaged in dialogue with the government and have \nhad a strong track record in securing government responsiveness to address fiduciary risks \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n38.  The government and the MOF have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement, as described in detail \nin the program implementation arrangements and grant documents. \n \n39.  The grant will become effective after all conditions for the release of the first tranche of \nthe program, as specified in the policy matrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the \ngrant agreement, have been complied with, to the satisfaction of ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n40.  I am satisfied that the proposed grant would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the  grant  not  exceeding  $21,000,000  to  Nepal  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds \nresources, for the Strengthening Public Management Program, on terms and \nconditions that are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft \ngrant agreement presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  the  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$4,000,000 to Nepal for the Strengthening Public Management Program, to be \nprovided by the Government of the United Kingdom; and \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $2,500,000 to the Government of Nepal for Supporting the Strengthening \nPublic Management Program to be provided by the Government of the United \nKingdom on a grant basis. \n \nHaruhiko V.
