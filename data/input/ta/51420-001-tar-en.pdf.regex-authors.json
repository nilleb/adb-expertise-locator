INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) government\u2019s continued efforts in air quality improvements in Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013\nHebei (BTH) and its surrounding areas (the greater BTH region).1 The TA will develop a road map \nfor air quality improvements in Handan City, Hebei Province, which can be replicated elsewhere \nin the greater BTH region and beyond. \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business \nplan, 2018\u20132020 for the PRC. It is aligned with the core aim of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, \n2016\u20132020, i.e., to manage climate change and the environment to support the government\u2019s \npriorities of building an \u201cecological civilization\u201d2  and shifting from high-speed growth and high \npollution to high-quality development.3  The TA supports the strategic thrust of ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030 to mitigate climate change and promote environmental sustainability.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The greater BTH region contributes to almost one-third of the PRC\u2019s total gross domestic \nproduct, making it one of the most important and dynamic regions in the country.5 High energy \nconsumption and pollution emissions, however, have accompanied the country\u2019s rapid economic \ngrowth from the 1980s to the mid-2010s. In 2017, 239 of 338 cities in the PRC failed to meet \nnational ambient air quality standards.6 In 2016, the greater BTH region accounted for large \nportions of total national emissions: 38.6% of sulfur dioxide, 38.3% of nitrogen oxide, and 45.4% \nof smoke and dust (footnote 5). According to the 2017 State of the Environment Report, 74 cities \nare implementing the newly amended ambient air quality standards. Among these, the top 10 \nmost heavily polluted cities are all in the greater BTH region, while Handan City is the second \nworst polluted city (footnote 6). \n \n4.  Air pollution has become an increasingly obtrusive problem. It greatly constrains the PRC's \nsocial and economic development and poses a substantial threat to public health. A 2016 World \nBank study showed that the cost of air pollution accounted for about 10% of the PRC\u2019s total gross \ndomestic product.7 The World Health Organization attributed almost half a million deaths in the \nPRC in 2012 to ambient air pollution.8 \n \n                                                \n1  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei and its surrounding areas include Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, Shandong, \nShanxi, and Liaoning provinces; and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n2  An \u201cecological civilization\u201d refers to achieving harmony between growth, people, and nature. It includes activities to \nmitigate ecological damage, relieve pressures on natural resources, and improve the balance between the \nenvironment and the economy. ADB. 2016.

The implementation of the Comprehensive Action Plan on Air Pollution Prevention and \nControl (CAAP) between 2013 and 2017 resulted in a decrease in average concentrations of \nparticulate matter less than 10 micrometers in diameter (PM ) by 22.7% in 338 major cities, and \n10\nparticulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM ) by 39.6% in the BTH region \n2.5\n(footnote 6). ADB has contributed to this achievement through supporting the central government \nwith several analytical, policy advisory, and capacity development assistance projects9 and loans \nfor air quality improvement in the greater BTH region.10 However, the PRC is still facing huge \nchallenges in air pollution control, especially in the greater BTH region. In 2017, the percentage \nof days with non-attainment of national ambient air quality standards ranged from 38.9% to 79.7% \nin 13 major cities in the BTH region, averaging 44% (footnote 6). In the State Council executive \nmeeting in June 2018, the government stated that fighting air pollution for a blue sky was the top \npriority of pollution control and prevention, and one of the main battlefields of the war to defend \nblue skies was in the BTH region.11  \n \n6.  The current air quality management system needs to be further strengthened, taking into \nconsideration long-term sustainability, all sources of pollution, and associated reduction costs. \nEfforts to control air pollution are currently constrained because \n(i)  top-down targets for reducing pollutant emissions, set by the central government, \nare not coupled with air quality improvement targets; \n(ii)  baseline data on emissions at the city level are inadequate to inform and set \nregional and municipal pollution reduction targets; \n(iii)  current air quality control puts much emphasis on key polluting industries instead \nof  also  considering  emissions  from  other  industries,  traffic,  and  households, \nespecially during heating season; and \n(iv)  apportionment studies of pollution sources and cost\u2013benefit analyses of various \npollution reduction measures are inadequate or even lacking. \n \n7.  The scope of ADB\u2019s previous TAs was mainly regional, while this TA will use a bottom-up \napproach to help develop a post-CAAP road map for air quality improvement at a city level, which \ncan be replicated by the cities with similar air pollution problems elsewhere in the greater BTH \nregion and beyond. Handan City is selected as a pilot city since it is one of the key cities for \npollution reduction targeted by the government in the greater BTH region. \n \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014.

Impacts and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: air pollution reduced, climate change \nmitigated, and air quality and public health improved in the greater BTH region.12 The TA will have \nthe following outcome: management and decision-making in air pollution control by the Handan \nMunicipal Government enhanced.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Emission inventory for Handan City developed. Policy-making for air quality \nimprovements requires a comprehensive and accurate emission inventory. This TA will support a \nsurvey to collect basic pollution emission data from different sectors and areas such as energy, \nindustrial, traffic, and residential in Handan City, Hebei Province. The TA team will use the results \nto develop an emission inventory for Handan City, which will also take into consideration pollution \nsources from neighboring cities. Based on the emission inventory, the TA will conduct a source \napportionment study and a simulation, and analyze the contributions of key industries and sources \nto total emissions in Handan City using a simulation and receptor model. \n \n10.  Output 2: Impacts of energy consumption and industrial structures on air quality \nand climate change assessed. The TA team will study the emissions from energy and main \nindustrial sectors to evaluate their impacts on air quality and climate change. The study will \ndevelop different scenarios to optimize energy and industrial structures in Handan City to reduce \nair pollution and mitigate climate change. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Investment  cost  database  of  main  pollution  reduction  measures \nestablished. The TA team will survey the current costs, including operation and maintenance \ncosts, of main air pollution control measures from different sectors such as transport, energy, or \nindustries in Handan City and undertake a cost\u2013benefit analysis. The team will use the results to \ncreate a database detailing investment costs of key air pollution reduction measures. \n \n12.  Output 4: Air pollution emission management database established. The TA will \nestablish a dynamic air pollution emission management database using a bottom-up approach. \nThis will enable the Handan Municipal Government to make policies and allocate financial \nresources for air quality management more effectively. \n \n13.  Output 5: Road map for air quality improvements in Handan City developed. Based \non  the  above  studies  and  analysis,  the  TA  team  will  develop  a  road  map  for  air  quality \nimprovements in Handan City and submit it to the Handan Municipal Government once the \nMinistry of Ecology and Environment has reviewed and approved it. \n \n                                                \n12 State  Council.  2018.
