INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of a \ndatabase on regional trade agreement (RTA) tariff commitments and several studies on the \neconomic effects of mega-RTAs, the factors driving their successful implementation, and key \npolicies to fully realize their economic benefits. These include market access aspects of the \nRegional  Comprehensive  Economic  Partnership  (RCEP)  and  the  Comprehensive  and \nProgressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) such as tariff commitments, rules \nof origin, services trade liberalization, trade facilitation, e-commerce, nontariff measures, technical \nbarriers to trade, and investment to improve understanding of their economic impact among policy \nmakers, academics, the private sector, and civil society. These will support policy advice and \ncapacity development of developing member countries (DMCs). \n \n2.  The TA is included in the Management-approved 2021 annual work program for the \nEconomic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) to benefit DMCs.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  As  global  and  regional  economies  prepare  to  reopen  and  begin recovery from  the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, trade uncertainty persists, including in readjustments \nin global and regional supply chains. On a positive note, the recent RCEP signing is expected to \ncreate the world\u2019s largest trading bloc, strongly boosting regional free trade efforts, upholding the \nmultilateral trade system, and deepening the region\u2019s open, transparent, and inclusive trade and \ninvestment for post-pandemic recovery. \n \n4.  However, experience shows that these benefits depend on successful implementation of \nRCEP commitments and willingness and capacity from the private sector to fully use its provisions \nwithin a context of overlapping and competing trade preference schemes (bilateral, regional, \nmultilateral). That is, RTAs are effective only when they are designed with business-friendly rules, \nimplemented transparently and predictably, and well understood by users.  \n \n5.  This requires interventions at three levels. First, policy makers need to design RTA \nprovisions reflecting industrial and global value chain constraints of member countries. The bigger \nthe RTA, the bigger the challenge to find rules suitable for all and better than opportunities \nprovided by existing bilateral and regional agreements. Second, weak government capacity to \nnegotiate and apply user-friendly trade rules\u2014resulting from lack of understanding of RTA impact \nand best practices\u2014often creates shallow or incomplete trade agreements with unclear legal \nprovisions. Third, limited outreach to explain RTA content, the complexity of RTAs, and unclear \ntrade rules can limit understanding of international trade rules. Users are either unable or unwilling \nto comply with the RTA requirements such as rules of origin, or may not know how to benefit from \npreferential treatment. In particular, unclear operational guidelines, such as for RCEP rules of \norigin, and insufficient training of customs officials may stifle transparency and predictability, \ndiscouraging private sector application for preferential border treatment. \n \n6.  Better understanding of the conditions or criteria for the success of trade agreements in \nAsia  is  therefore  needed  to  formulate  sound,  relevant,  timely,  and  targeted  policy \nrecommendations and actions at the three levels. By working closely with all RTA stakeholders, \nthis TA aims to: (i) strengthen understanding of key factors in successful RTA implementation, (ii) \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 May 2021. Activities will initially \ntake place in the RCEP region. Capacity building will focus on DMCs identified as priority by knowledge products. \n ", "2 \nallow  elaboration  of  strategies  and  trade  policy  options  across  economies  and  sectors  to \nmaximize  positive  RTA  impact,  and  (iii)  mitigate  and  manage  costs  that  arise  during \nimplementation and allow better trade and investment actions.  \n \n7.  The TA aligns with the regional cooperation and integration operational plan for priority 7 \nof ADB Strategy 2030, pillar 2.2 With its concrete and operational recommendations and actions \nfor establishment of regional public goods leveraging the RTA commitments, the TA aligns with \nADB\u2019s objective to strengthen convergence on regional cooperation and integration performance \namong  developing  member  countries  by  subregion,  so  that  subregional  agreements\u2014or \nsubregional implementation of wider regional or interregional agreements, e.g., the Association \nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Community, CPTPP, and RCEP\u2014can be more \neffectively implemented through ADB-assisted investment operations (footnote 2).  \n \n8.  The TA supports key findings from ADB\u2019s knowledge work enhancing the capacity of \nregional members to enforce regional trade governance through RTAs consistently with similar \ninitiatives of other leading international agencies, such as the World Trade Organization, World \nBank, World Customs Organization, and United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.3 \n \n9.  The TA is consistent with the trade targets of Sustainable Development Goal 17 by raising \nunderstanding of how RTAs can increase the exports of developing countries and their share in \nglobal exports, promote investment, and create jobs, contributing to inclusive growth.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Improved implementation of trade agreements \nin participating ADB regional members.4 The TA will have the following outcome: Increased \nknowledge and awareness among RTAs stakeholders (policy makers, government, private sector, \ncivil society, and the public) of trade and investment effects of mega-RTAs such as RCEP and \nCPTPP (with other RTAs).5 This will be done through elaboration and dissemination of at least \nthree high-quality studies to promote understanding and policy dialogue (among governments, \nprivate sector, civil society, the ASEAN and ASEAN+3 secretariats, multilateral organizations, \nand  ADB-supported  subregional  cooperation  programs  such  as  for  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Economic Cooperation Program) and raise the capacity of policy makers to maximize \nRTA net benefits and marginal costs.6 The proposed recommendations and database will support \n \n2 ADB. 2018.

Pillar 2 aims to expand global and regional trade and investment opportunities by DMC implementation \nof global and regional trade and investment agreements through open regionalism across Asia and the Pacific.  \n3 The TA on Free Trade Agreements in Asia: The Way Ahead usefully raised knowledge, awareness, and debate about \nfree trade agreements in Asia and provided a base of knowledge on trade policy capacity building within ADB. The free \ntrade agreement database of ADB\u2019s Asia Regional Integration Center tracks and comprehensively lists bilateral and \nplurilateral free trade agreements that have at least one of ADB\u2019s 48 regional members as a signatory. It covers all \nagreements at all stages of development, from those under study or consultation to those in force. \n4 Defined by the TA in alignment with operational priority 7: fostering regional cooperation and integration. \n5 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n6 ASEAN+3 refers to ASEAN, Japan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, and the Republic of Korea. The TA will also take \nstock and build on the achievements of past ADB programs such as the TA on Advancing Time Release Studies in \nSoutheast  Asia  (https://www.adb.org/projects/50251-001/main)  covering  ASEAN,  Cambodia,  Myanmar,  the \nPhilippines, and the Brunei Darussalam\u2013Indonesia\u2013Malaysia\u2013Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA). It \nwill also coordinate work with relevant ongoing programs such as the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) and the Greater Mekong Subregion. \n ", "3 \n(i) further knowledge, such as flagship reports and other databases, and (ii) ADB\u2019s operational \nwork, such as identification of regional public goods and subsequent investment projects, beyond \nthe implementation period of the KSTA. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output  1:  Knowledge  products  with  regional  and  country  level  policy \nrecommendations delivered. This includes two categories: (i) thematic knowledge products on \nspecific key components of trade agreements such as rules of origin and trade facilitation, \nservices, e-commerce, investment, mechanisms to eliminate nontariff measures, and (ii) general \nstudies on the impact and implications of trade agreements and their challenges, such as \ndiscrimination against nonparties to RTAs. The TA will prioritize RCEP and CPTPP member \ncountries with upcoming trade and competitiveness policy-based lending. Studies will analyze:  \n(i)  the agreement\u2019s main text, legal provisions, meaning, and practical implications; \n(ii)  the value added of mega-RTAs over existing preferences schemes in (a) market \naccess focusing on key components such as tariff phase down, preference margin, \nand rules of origin (requirements and administration), and (b) other key provisions \nsuch as trade facilitation, services and e-commerce, sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures, technical barriers to trade, investment, and dispute settlement; \n(iii)  challenges during implementation for the public and private sectors, including the \nmost vulnerable groups (e.g., micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises); \n(iv)  the capacity and willingness of countries to implement and comply with RTA \nprovisions based on economic, structural, and geographical situations (e.g., low-\nincome landlocked countries struggling with direct shipment requirements); and  \n(v)  the characteristics of critical sectors, including gender aspects when appropriate.  \n \n12.  Such elements are a prerequisite for any RTA to fully realize potential benefits. Research \nwill focus initially on RCEP. As mega-RTAs cannot be studied in isolation, agreements such as \nCPTPP and bilateral agreements will also be studied to accurately evaluate and compare the \nvalue added and the effective trade impact of existing RTAs. The TA will expand its focus to trade \npreferences schemes that overlap and compete with RCEP: ASEAN+1 and other bilateral and \nmultilateral agreements in which RCEP members are involved. Based on countries\u2019 needs, and \nlessons from RCEP and other overlapping RTAs, the TA will broaden its geographical coverage. \n \n13.  The TA will produce and disseminate a report that examines potential RCEP impacts on \ntrade and income. Building on existing research, in particular by P. A. Petri and M. G. Plummer, \nthe report will use a computable general equilibrium model to assess RCEP income impact by \n2030 and identify countries that will benefit most and those likely to incur losses.7 Because \ninternet and printer access in some DMCs is limited, ERCD will print and distribute 250 RCEP \nreports to country policy makers, stakeholders, and requestors, including officials and staff of \nregional and global institutions, academics, and college graduates and students. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Database  on  trade  agreements  with  dashboard  and  visualization \nestablished. In collaboration with international experts and partners, ADB will set up a database, \nincluding RCEP\u2019s tariff phase-down and services commitments. This database is important \nbecause no multilateral mechanism is in place to systematically report RTA information to carry \n \n7 P. A. Petri and M. G. Plummer. 2020.

Building on Petri and \nPlummer\u2019s work, refined scenarios will better account for labor market adjustments, domestic reforms, rules of origin, \nand services, and will envisage different degrees of implementation based on thematic studies. \n ", "4 \nout research and capacity building activities such as those proposed in this TA. The database, its \naccompanying user guide, and metadata will be available to all RTA stakeholders to address the \nthree levels of the problem analysis diagram. The provisional structure of the database includes \nthe following entries: reporter, partner, year, product, tariff commitment, and preference margin. \n \n15.  While the database will be used to conduct research under output 1, it is expected to \ncontinue to be updated and used beyond the KSTA implementation period, running empirical \nstudies and applied research to serve requests from ADB members and support the creation of \nregional public goods that will benefit the most vulnerable groups that cannot afford the collection, \nanalysis, and treatment of data. Output activities will include exchange of information and \nexploring cooperation with regional secretariats such as ASEAN and other think tanks to build up \nand expand the database. It is expected that the database will progressively integrate tariff phase \nout of other RTAs and CPTPP to compare the effective trade liberalization of RCEP, at least in \ntariffs and product-specific rules of origin.8 \n \n16.  Output 3: Capacity building with public and private RTA stakeholders delivered. \nBased  on  outputs  1  and  2, the  TA  will  advocate  and disseminate  best  practices  in trade \nagreements, particularly on rules of origin, tariff phase-down, and trade facilitation. Activities will \ninclude capacity building and policy dialogue among stakeholders: trade negotiators, policy \nmakers, customs officials, the private sector, civil society, and effective users of trade agreements. \nTo the extent possible, particular focus will be given to the most vulnerable economies, in \nparticular RCEP least developed countries that are also the ASEAN\u2019s newest members. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7 and TASF-Others) and (ii) $450,000 \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.9 Key \nexpenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n18.  Civil works, procurement of large-scale equipment (such as machinery and other capital \nequipment), and salary for permanent staff of TA\u2019s executing and/or implementing agencies are \ntypical non-eligible expenditures under the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Economic  Research  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment (ERCD) will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and resource persons; \nprocure goods; organize workshops and conferences with partner agencies; and provide staff \nand/or  coordinate  ADB  staff  for  support  services  and  participation  in  the  workshops  and \nconferences. Conforming to the One ADB principle, collaboration with regional departments and \nmissions, as well as the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s sector and \nthematic groups will be pursued during TA implementation.  \n \n20.  Implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n8 The TA will carry out advocacy activities with RCEP countries and institutions to ensure the sustainability of the \ndatabase. In addition, the proposed recommendations of the TA and its database will greatly support further knowledge \nand operational work. Updates are, therefore, expected to be funded by subsequent regional cooperation and \nintegration TA projects. This will also make the case for resolving any issues related to the sustainability of this initiative \nand finance needs for updates of the database. \n9 Established by ADB.
