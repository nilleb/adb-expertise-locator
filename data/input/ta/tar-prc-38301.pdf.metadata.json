During  the  2004  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the Government \nprepare the Dryland Farming in the Northern Region project to be financed by an ADB loan and \na Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant. The Project will be implemented in four provinces: \nGansu, Henan, Shanxi, and Shandong. In March 2005, the Fact-Finding Mission visited the \nPRC to hold discussions with the provincial governments\u2019 staff, and understanding was reached \nwith  the  PRC  Government  on  the  detailed  objectives,  scope,  costs,  implementation,  and \nfinancing arrangements for the technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Project. The Project will \nsupport  the  provinces  in  combating  land  degradation  and  promote  sustainable  income-\ngenerating activities.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The drylands2 which represent about 40% of the PRC\u2019s land area are located in the \nnorth, northeast and northwest, and the Loess Plateau. The drylands are home to over 100 \nmillion people, about 65% of whom are considered rural dwellers having agriculture-based \nactivities as their main source of income. The drylands contribute 56% of the PRC\u2019s national \ngrain crops, together with cash crops and animal products, but they are suffering from severe \nand rapidly spreading land degradation. At present, land degradation in the northern drylands \naffects 70% of the arable area (54 million hectares) and accounts for about $21 million per day \nin  lost  income  due  to  declining  productivity.3  While  land  degradation  has  long  been  a \ncharacteristic of the PRC drylands, the area of land classed as degraded has accelerated \nrapidly, from 1,500 square kilometers per year in the 1970s to 3,500 square kilometers per year \nin  the  late  1990s.  Land  degradation  has  been  caused,  in  part,  by  many  well-meaning \nshortsighted  policies  and  programs  that  have  inadvertently  caused  or  exacerbated  land \ndegradation. Examples include conversion of grasslands to irrigated agriculture resulting in \nincreased  pressure  on  the  remaining  livestock  grazing  areas,  and  local  problems  of \nwaterlogging and salinization; and conversion of farmland to forests and/or grasslands where \nplanting single species of trees and/or grasses over large areas has further reduced local \nbiodiversity. \n \n3.  Moreover, the promotion of mechanical tillage and removal of all crop residues for stall \nfeeding livestock have led to loss of protective ground cover, soil organic matter, nutrients, and \ntopsoil structure, and have produced compacted subsoil layers and increased susceptibility to \nwind and water erosion. Such inappropriate farming practices have also impacted at the global \nlevel through the burning of fossil fuels in mechanized farming and the burning of organic \nresidues as household fuel, as well as the loss of carbon sinks, which in turn contribute to global \nwarming and climate change as well as reduced biodiversity due to the destruction of natural \nhabitats. Rural poverty persists especially in dryland farming areas where more than 30% of the \npopulation live below the poverty line. \n \n4.  A  number  of  international  agencies,  i.e.,  ADB,  Canadian  International  Development \nAgency (CIDA), United Nations Environment Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank, have \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 May 2005. \n2 The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), adopted by the PRC, determines the aridity \nzones on an aridity index. On this basis, \u201cdrylands,\u201d as used by the UNCCD, encompass the arid, semiarid, and dry \nsubhumid zones. Based on this definition, all land in the northern and western areas of the PRC are drylands. \n3 Source: Chinese Journal of Population, Resources and Environment, 2002. Vol.12, 2.

Place of Publication: Publisher.} \n ", "2   \nworked  with  the  Government  to  improve  natural  resource  management  in  drylands. \nInternationally supported projects have focused principally on activities relating to improved \ndryland  agriculture,  forestry  development,  grassland  improvement,  and  multipurpose  water \nresource  management,  including  irrigation  and  flood  control.  The  PRC  has  welcomed  the \nintroduction  of  a  number  of  international  best  practices  (technologies  and  approaches)  for \nimproved dryland natural resource management, including the concept of integrated ecosystem \nmanagement  (IEM).  However,  the  experience  gained  has  yet  to  be  mainstreamed  in  its \ndomestic programs, in part because there has been limited sharing of experiences between  \ninternational funding agencies as well as with the Government\u2019s executing agencies. The efforts \nof  the  domestic  program  and  the  international  supported  projects  have  been  piecemeal, \nfragmented, inefficient, and ineffective in arresting land degradation and improving dryland \necosystems. To address these problems, the PRC-GEF Partnership4 on Land Degradation in \nDryland Ecosystems was approved in 2002 and is being coordinated by ADB on behalf of \ndevelopment partner agencies like the World Bank. The Partnership aims to reduce poverty, \narrest land degradation, and restore dryland ecosystems in the country's western provinces. It is \ngoverned by the Country Programme Framework (CPF) which covers a 10-year period (2003-\n2012). The CPF provides a coherent framework for prioritizing and sequencing interventions \nthat integrate land degradation control, biodiversity conservation, and carbon sequestration in \nPRC\u2019s planning framework. The CPF supports a sequenced set of priority activities that serve to \n(i)  strengthen  the  enabling  environment  and  build  institutional  capacity  for  adopting  an \nintegrated  approach  to  combat  land  degradation,  and  (ii)  demonstrate  viable  IEM  models, \nincluding conservation agriculture (CA) approaches, useful for widespread replication.  \n \n5.  As part of the implementation of the Partnership, the Government has requested ADB\u2019s \nsupport in identifying and implementing appropriate ways to combat land degradation in a \nsustainable manner and, at the same time, provide alternative ways to increase rural income, \nboth on- and off-farm. Improvement in rural income will support the adoption of better farming \npractices that help arrest land degradation. In response to the Government\u2019s request, it has \nbeen proposed that the Project aim to introduce internationally proven and successful CA \napproaches  as  a  more  environment-friendly  alternative  to  combat  land  degradation.  CA \ncomprises (i) minimum or zero tillage, (ii) permanent soil cover (plant residues and/or cover \ncrops), and (iii) crop rotations. Increasing the amount and depth of soil cover reduces erosion \nfrom wind and water.. Through increased soil cover, which improves the capacity of the soil to \naccept and retain moisture, water is better utilized, with positive impacts on productivity of soil.5 \nMost importantly, by increasing the soil cover and reducing the use of fossil fuel, CA contributes \nsignificantly to improvements in the global environment through increased carbon sequestration, \nimproved land and water biodiversity, reduced carbon dioxide production,  and slowdown in \nglobal warming.  \n  \n6.  Gansu, Shanxi, Henan and Shandong form the target area as (i) they have a wide range \nof climatic, agricultural, economic, and social conditions of the northern dryland region; (ii) the \nmajority  of  their  rural  residents  are  poor;  (iii)  land  degradation  (recognized  as  the  prime \nconstraint to increase productivity and farm income) is endemic and extensive; and (iv) they \ncollectively offer a wide range of agro-ecological conditions for replication elsewhere. \n                                                 \n4 The Global Environment Facility (GEF), established in 1991, is an independent financial organization that helps \ndeveloping  countries  through  grant  financing  for  the  preparation  and  implementation  of  projects  related  to \nbiodiversity, climate change, and land degradation. \n5 Worldwide, under conservation agriculture (CA), yields have increased by an average of 30%, gained over a period \nof 3\u20134 years. CA trials in the PRC began in 1992 with benefits quantified as follows: 20\u201330% increase in net annual \nincome, 19% increase in wheat yield, 60% reduction in wind and water erosion, 20-30% reduction in herbicide \nusage, 19% increase in crop water use efficiency,  35% increase in organic matter, and increased soil biodiversity. \n ", "  3\n7.  Gansu in the northwest region has a total area of 45.4 million hectares of which 5 million \nhectares (10%) is arable (60% is sloping land). Wheat occupies 20%, maize 11%, and cotton \n1.5% of the arable area with other cash crops including fruit, melons, and Chinese herbs. About \n86% of its land in 18 counties is said to have serious water erosion with an annual direct \neconomic loss of $100 million and an indirect loss of $200 million. Henan in the central eastern \nregion has a total land area of 16.7 million hectares, of which 7.9 million hectares is arable. \nAnnual average precipitation is 600 millimeters, while evaporation is 1,200\u20131,800 millimeters \nper annum, seriously limiting surface water and groundwater resources. Erosion due to wind \nand water is widespread and some 4.1 million hectares suffers from land degradation (over 25% \nof the total land area). Henan produces wheat, corn, rice, soybean, and potato; and cash crops \nof cotton, peanut, sesame, vegetables, melons and fruit, as well as herbal medicines and edible \nfungus.  Shanxi  in  the  eastern  part  of  the  Loess  Plateau,  has  16%  of  its  23  million  rural \npopulation classed as poor (average annual per capita net income is $280). The arable area is \n3.9 million hectares (27.5% of the total) of which 2.8 million hectares (72%) is drylands. The \nmain grain crops are maize, wheat, and cereals. Annual rainfall is about 550 millimeters, while \nthe average annual evaporation is 2,400 millimeters, resulting in serious water shortages. Water \nerosion occurs on 11 million hectares. Wind erosion affects 3.9 million hectares (mainly in the \nsouth) with an annual loss rate of 5,000 to 5,800 tons per square kilometer. Soil organic matter \nin these areas is only 0.6-0.8%. Shandong is in the east but is classified as belonging to the \nnorthern PRC plain according to agricultural zone classification. It is one of the most densely \npopulated provinces with 91 million people dwelling in 15.6 million hectares, of which 6.6 million \nhectares is arable. Of the total province area, 40% is dryland with average annual rainfall of 676 \nmillimeters. Each year, 1.7 million hectares of arable land suffers from drought (22% of the \narable area). The eroded area is 6 million hectares (42% of the arable area); erosion in 82% \ndue to water, which removes an estimated 300 million tons of soil per annum.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will help the Government to prepare a project focusing on reducing the rate of \nland degradation in the PRC through the widespread adoption of CA production techniques. For \nthat purpose, the TA will use the four target provinces as pilot models from which lessons can \nbe extracted and applied to the rest of the PRC. The Project will comprise a package of \ninvestment, policy, and institutional measures that will address land degradation and provide \ncomplementary sustainable income-generating activities to improve farmers\u2019 living conditions \nwhich have strongly influenced the occurrence and degree of land degradation. The feasibility \nstudy for the Project will include (i) relevant analysis of technical, environmental, economic, \nfinancial,  and  social  aspects  and  policy  options;  and  (ii)  criteria  for  selecting  appropriate \nsubprojects.  Possible  ADB-financed  components  include  (i)  cash  crop  diversification  by \npromoting varieties suitable for dryland areas and cultivated using CA practices; (ii) integration \nof  intensive  cropping  and  livestock  production  to  maximize  the  sustainable  use  of  natural \nresources; (iii) promotion of agroprocessing enterprises that support CA, with an envisaged \nreduction of land degradation and improvement of productivity; (iv) improvement of marketing \nsystems by developing marketing infrastructure to realize benefits from increased production \ndue to increased productivity; and (v) building the capacity to implement and adopt CA. A stand-\nalone GEF component, which will be formulated subject to availability of GEF grant funding,6 will \n                                                 \n6  The Project\u2019s concept note and application for the Project Development Facility were submitted to GEF on 20 April  \n2005, and reviewed by the GEF Secretariat who gave technical clearance on the proposal on 11 May 2005. For \nGEF to officially commit and provide grant funds for the Project, the application for GEF grant funding first has to \nbe endorsed by the GEF focal point in the PRC and then by GEF\u2019s chief executive officer. Both endorsements are \nexpected by September 2005. In the unlikely event that the GEF grant is not forthcoming, the TA will be \n ", "4   \ninclude  (i)  formulation  of  policies  to  support  IEM;  (ii)  implementation  of  a  comprehensive \ncapacity-building strategy for formulating, creating, and implementing strategies for CA, and \nlocal stakeholders\u2019 training to achieve implementation of CA; (iii) strengthening of community- \nbased  planning  for  integrated  ecosystem  approaches;  and  (iv)  formulation  of  ecosystem \nindicators for monitoring and evaluation (M&E). The design and monitoring framework for the \nTA is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be undertaken in three phases. In phase 1, the consultants will (i) review \ndryland agriculture improvement and investment plans; (ii) carry out constraints and needs \nanalyses for infrastructure for commercialization of agroprocessing and marketing systems; and \n(iii) review land and water conservation policies, financial and technical institutional framework, \ntechnical and human capacity. In phase 2, the consultants will: (i) assess training needs and \nprepare a training plan; (ii) prepare an outline dryland agriculture investment plan for integrated \nagro-ecological  resource  management  identifying  subprojects  and  guidelines  for  selecting \nsubprojects and preparing feasibility studies; (iii) assess proposed designs and costs of core \nsubprojects and conduct preliminary analysis to establish criteria for appraising and selecting \nsubprojects; and (iv) prepare a draft final report. Consultants will also prepare a poverty impact \nassessment outlining the profile of the targeted poor, poverty intervention features, the extent of \nbenefits received by the poor, and other relevant analyses as given in ADB\u2019s Handbook for \nPoverty and Social Analysis. A gender assessment will be also carried out covering issues \ndefined  in  the  gender  and  development  section  of  the  initial  poverty  and  social  analysis \n(Appendix  2).  In  phase  3,  TA  activities  will  include  (i)  technical  assessment  of  project \ninterventions (both ADB- and GEF-financed) and confirmation of the benefits from stabilization \nand remediation of degraded land, environmental protection, and environmentally sustainable \nfarm production; (ii) economic analyses of project components, by assessment of financial \nmanagement  project  executing/implementing  agencies,  and  financial  analysis  of  project \ncomponents conducted in accordance with the Guidelines for the Financial Management and \nGovernance of Investment Projects Financed by ADB, project cost estimation using Costab \nsoftware with an assessment of recurrent cost implications for participating entities; (iii) analysis \nof the expected project beneficiaries and affected groups, based on the initial social assessment \nand  poverty  impact  assessment  completed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Handbook  for \nIncorporation  of  Social  Dimensions  in  Projects;  (iv)  preparation  of  an  initial  environmental \nexamination (IEE) in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Agricultural \nand Natural Resources Development Projects, Environmental Assessment Requirements, and \nEnvironmental Review Procedures; (v) preparation of a project performance M&E system; and \n(vi) preparation of full documentation for submission to the GEF Council to apply grant funding \nfor the ensuing project.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1.09 million equivalent, of which $494,000 is \nin  foreign  exchange  and  $596,000  equivalent  is  in  local  currency.  The  Government  has \nrequested that ADB finance $400,000 equivalent and that GEF finance $350,000 equivalent. \nADB will finance $272,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $128,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost; this part of the TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The expected GEF grant assistance of $350,000, will be used to finance $222,000 of \n                                                                                                                                                          \nimplemented without the GEF component. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference have been developed for each of \nthe two components according to financing source, with clearly defined outcomes and impacts for each component \n(see TA design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) and outline of terms of reference for consultants (Appendix \n4). \n ", "  5\nthe  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $128,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will \nadminister the GEF grant.  The Government will finance the balance of the local cost, equivalent \nto $340,000, by providing counterpart costs and services. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. The detailed \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) will be the EA for the TA. MOA will (i) provide office \nspace and full-time professional counterparts to work closely with the consultants; (ii) assign \nimplementation responsibility to the director of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Center; and \n(iii) promote policy dialogue and organize workshops and seminars during which project design \nand related issues will be discussed with the active participation of national and provincial \ngovernment agencies and representatives of farmers, nongovernment organizations, other aid \nagencies, and private sector entrepreneurs. Full-time counterpart staff to facilitate the work of \nthe consultants and suitably furnished offices, local transport for field visits, and materials for the \nTA  will  be  provided  by  the  Government.  Each  province  will  set  up  a  committee  with \nrepresentatives  from  the  Provincial  Agriculture  Department,  Provincial  Agriculture \nMechanization Management Department (in charge of CA implementation activities), Provincial \nFinancial Bureau, Provincial Development and Reform and Commission, and local government \nto advise the TA team. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, starting in October 2005 and ending in \nMarch 2006. A consulting firm will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants. The quality-cost based selection method, using simplified technical proposal, will \nbe  adopted.  The  TA  will  include  60  person-months  of  consulting  services:  comprising  23 \ninternational and 37 domestic. The international consultants will have expertise in economics \nand financial management, conservation agriculture, agronomy, policy analysis, participatory \nfarming  systems,  and  natural  resource  management.  The  domestic  consultants  will  have \nexpertise in dryland ecosystems, CA, agribusiness, animal husbandry, poverty issues, natural \nresource assessment, legal policy issues, participatory farming systems, agronomy, natural \nresource  management,  and  poverty  issues.  The  consultants  will  be  required  to  prepare \ninception,  interim,  draft  final,  and  final  reports.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  consulting \nservices and the reporting requirements are in Appendix 4. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering the Global Environment Facility (GEF) component of technical assistance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the GEF; (ii) ADB \nproviding  the  balance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis,  to  the \nGovernment  of  the  People's  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Dryland  Farming  in  the \nNorthern Region Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
