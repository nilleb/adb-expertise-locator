Madhya Pradesh, located in central India, is the second-largest state by area and the sixth \nmost populous state with 78 million people.1 It is among the lower-income states in India with per \ncapita income at about 70% of the national average.2 Yet, during FY2012\u2013FY2018 Madhya \nPradesh recorded impressive economic growth averaging over 8.0%, higher than the national \naverage of 6.9%. Agriculture underpinned the recent growth with double-digit growth. And the \nindustry  sector  has  emerged  strong  attracting  large  investments  in  the  manufacturing  and \nservices  subsectors,  such  as  automotive  and  auto  components,  electronics,  information \ntechnology (IT), food processing, and renewable energy. To convert vibrant investments into \nsustained economic growth, Madhya Pradesh requires a well-trained workforce to meet current \nand emerging skill demands across the core industries.  \n \n2.  The proposed Madhya Pradesh Skills Development Project will help the Government of \nMadhya Pradesh (GOMP) transform its technical and vocational education and training (TVET) \nsystem to create a skilled workforce that meets the state\u2019s evolving development needs.3 The \nproject will establish a new advanced TVET institute of international standards\u2014Global Skills Park \n(GSP)\u2014to introduce high-quality, technology-oriented skills training for the state\u2019s priority sectors. \nThe project will also modernize 10 major industrial training institutes (ITIs) by upgrading training \ninfrastructure and curricula to impart quality, industry-relevant skills. The project aims to increase \nthe employability, productivity, and incomes of the workforce, especially youth, women, and \ndisadvantaged groups. The project is estimated to cost $240 million, of which $150 million will be \nfinanced by a regular loan from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB).  The  proposed  project  and  the  technical  assistance  are  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country \noperations and business plan, 2018\u20132020 for India.4 \n \nII.  THE TECHINCAL ASSISTANCE \nA.    Justification \n \n3.  Madhya Pradesh faces formidable challenges in equipping the young workforce with skills \nthat meet the demand from current and emerging industries. The emerging industries require mid- \nto higher-level skilled workers as skill sets across the sectors increasingly rely on technology \napplications.5 The current workforce is mostly unskilled with nearly two-thirds having only up to \nprimary education, and just 1.2% of workers have undergone formal vocational training. While \nTVET is essential for the growing youth population to acquire job-related skills, TVET in the state, \nespecially  the  ITIs,  suffer  from  outdated  training  infrastructure  and  curricula,  inadequate \nqualifications of trainers, and lack of industrial alignment in training programs. The state has \nlimited capacity to deliver higher-level training for the skills demanded by today\u2019s fast-changing \nindustries,  where  skills  become  grounded  on  IT-based  equipment  and  automated  system \ntechnologies.   \n \n                                                           \n1  Government of India, Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner. 2006. Population Projections for \nIndia and States 2001\u20132026. New Delhi.  \n2  Government of India. Open Government Data Platform India. www.data.gov.in (accessed on 15 May 2018).  \n3   ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance for the Madhya Pradesh Skills Development Project (TA 9253-\nIND). \n4  ADB. 2017. India: Country Operation and Business Plan 2018\u20132020. Manila.   \n5  A skills gap analysis, conducted during project preparation, indicated an overall labor demand of 5.6 million during \n2018\u20132024, with the highest demand in construction and manufacturing, followed by trades and repair services, \ntransportation and logistics, and other services. Of the overall demand, nearly two-thirds are at least semi-skilled or \nhighly skilled workers.  ", "2   \n4.   The project will support GOMP with the following unique features. First, it will help build a \nvertical skills path between the ITIs and GSP through which mid- to advanced-level skills can be \nprogressively acquired for job readiness. GSP will introduce technology-oriented skills of global \nstandards  in  the  state\u2019s  priority  manufacturing  and  service  sectors,  as  well  as  advanced \nagricultural training. GSP will also include TVET support services, such as training of trainers, \ncurriculum development and skill-related research, and entrepreneurship support programs. The \nITIs will focus on quality mid-level skills programs under Craftsman Trade Schemes (CTS). \nTraining at the GSP and ITIs will take an industrial cluster approach to develop a range of core \nskills for strategic priority sectors. Second, the project will benchmark training quality at GSP to \ninternational standards. For advanced training on manufacturing and services trades at GSP, the \nproject will engage two international TVET partners\u2014the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) \nSingapore and Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)\u2014to bring global \nbest practices in training infrastructure, teaching, TVET management, industry cooperation, and \nquality assurance. For ITIs, training infrastructure and curricula will be upgraded to meet national \ncertificate standards, which will enable trainees to access higher-wage jobs in pubic and large \nprivate sector firms.   \n \n5.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) attached to the project is proposed to support \nstart-up activities of GSP and ITIs, especially those setting up innovative and knowledge-based \nelements requiring international and national expertise. The TA is proposed to help the executing \nand implementing agencies build the capacity for effective implementation as well. For successful \nimplementation of the project, it is essential to establish targeted intervention strategies that are \nmost suitable to Madhya Pradesh, while adopting global and national best practices to enhance \nthe overall TVET system. The TA will facilitate the adoption of best practices based on global \nknowledge and experiences for implementation under the project.  \n \n6.  The objective of the TA is two-fold. For GSP, it will support the initial set-up of several \nGSP components that require specialized expertise, such as detailed operational plans for the \nGSP Society, advanced agricultural training, and entrepreneurship development program. For the \nITIs, the TA will help the implementing agency\u2014the Directorate of Skill Development (DOSD)\u2014\nput reform initiatives in place to improve the ITI management and introduce performance-based \nincentive schemes for ITIs. The specific outputs and key activities are described below.  \n \nB.    Outputs and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA\u2019s impact is aligned with the loan project, which will be increased employability and \nproductivity of the workforce in Madhya Pradesh. The TA\u2019s outcome will be enhanced capacity of \nthe executing and implementing agencies for effective project implementation.  \n \n8.  Output  1:  Operation  and  management  plans  for  GSP  developed.  The  following \nactivities will be undertaken:  \n \n(i)  Establish operational and governance structure of the GSP Society. GOMP is \ncreating the GSP Society to facilitate more efficient and effective management of \nadvanced training and other support clusters at GSP. GSP will have autonomy in \nhiring  staff,  accessing funds  other  than  the government  budget,  and forging \npartnerships with international technical institutes.6 GSP will be registered as a \n                                                           \n6  In India, government projects are often implemented by forming a society, authority, or corporation (e.g., MP Road \nDevelopment Corporation) to facilitate efficient implementation. Once a society is formed with its rules and ", "  3 \nSociety under the Madhya Pradesh Societies Registration Act, 1973; this will be \ncritical for the sustainability of the loan project.  \n \n(ii)  Develop detailed implementation plans for advanced agricultural training, which \nwill focus on smart farming and post-harvest technologies. Although agriculture in \nMadhya Pradesh has achieved remarkable growth in recent years, advanced \nknowledge and skills are called for to spur productivity and tap into higher-income \nopportunities by moving up the value chain. Introducing advanced training at GSP \nis also envisaged to attract and motivate young people\u2019s engagement in the sector, \nwhile preventing the migration of rural youth to urban areas. Agricultural training \nprograms are to be implemented in partnership with international (or national) \ninstitutional partners and agribusiness partners to ensure market orientation of the \ntraining and to promote entrepreneurship.  \n \n(iii)  Finalize the operational model for the Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship \n(CIE) at GSP and pilot the program for selective applicants. GSP will promote start-\nup businesses for skilled youth, including graduates from the ITIs and GSP. The \nTA will support the adoption of best models for youth in the state, which will offer \nintegrated support such as entrepreneurship training, advice on business ideas, \nfinancial opportunities, marketing channels, and administrative and mentoring \nsupport.  The  TA  will  support  piloting  the  best  support  option  with  selective \napplicants.  \n \n9.  Output 2: ITI\u2019s management capacity to implement quality market-relevant training \nimproved. The project will invest in upgrading training facilities and equipment in 10 major ITIs \nlocated across the state\u2019s 10 divisions. To ensure that such investments lead to improvements in \nthe quality and relevance of training, as well as improved management practices of ITIs, the TA \nwill assist DOSD to develop reform initiatives that can invigorate ITI management and training \npractices. The specific activities under this output include the following: \n \n(i)  Support the 10 divisional ITIs in preparing their own institutional development \nplans.  These  will  include  detailed  steps  for  improving  the  quality  of  training \nprograms,  strengthening  the  links  to  industries,  improving  the  operation  and \nmaintenance of training infrastructure, developing effective in-service training for \ntrainers  and  management  staff,  and  making  tangible  outcomes  of  training \nprograms.  \n \n(ii)  Assist DOSD in designing a performance-rating system for the ITIs that is linked \nto incentive schemes. This will help ensure the effective implementation and \noutcomes of ITI institutional development plans. The ITIs are expected to be rated \nalong  various  dimensions  in  performance, such  as  job  placements,  effective \nindustry partnerships, and outreach for disadvantaged groups. \n \n(iii)  Support the identification of short-term training courses with expert inputs. The ITIs \nwould implement mostly long-term (1\u20132 years) training programs under CTS, \nwhich would offer a national certificate. To utilize upgraded training facilities and \nto serve the local training needs of diverse socioeconomic groups, the ITIs will also \n                                                           \nregulations,  projects  can  be  implemented  more  autonomously  without  undergoing  departmental  approval \nprocedures, which often impede implementation progress.  ", "4   \nidentify short-term training courses, especially targeted at women and socially \nmarginalized groups.  \n \n10.  Output 3: TVET knowledge, information, and management capacity strengthened. \nThis output will support critical analytic work at the initial project stage, which will build a basis for \nassessing  project  outcomes  and  strengthen  knowledge  components  during  project \nimplementation. The specific activities under this output are the following:  \n \n(i)  Conduct an initial tracer study of ITI and other TVET graduates, which will become \nbaseline  indicators  and  monitoring  methods  for  evaluating  the  project\u2019s \nperformance, particularly the relevance and effectiveness of TVET programs in \nMadhya Pradesh. Two follow-up studies will be undertaken\u2014one under the loan \nproject and the other after project completion by the government funding. \n \n(ii)  Design innovative e-platforms to provide IT-based TVET information and career \nguidance to TVET trainees. This will enable trainees to steer their skill acquisition \ndecision  through  various  TVET  institutes.  Once  the  design  is  completed,  its \nimplementation will be carried out under the loan project to make the program \nanchored at GSP and made available through all ITIs in the state. \n \n(iii)  Organize two knowledge events to share innovative practices in skills training and \nTVET management across the states in India. The TA will also build the capacity \nof  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  in  project  management  and \nimplementation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.2 million, of which $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB.
