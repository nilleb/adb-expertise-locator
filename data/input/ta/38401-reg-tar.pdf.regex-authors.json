Regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  on  Managing  Hazardous  Wastes,1 previously \nknown as Review of Regulation on Hazardous Wastes for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and \nNepal (BBIN), was proposed by the Environmental Working Group of South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation (SASEC) at its special meeting in 2002, and endorsed at the Country \nAdvisors Meeting in 2005. The proposed RETA is included in the regional cooperation strategy \nand program (RCSP) for 2006\u20132008. \n \n2.  Fact-finding missions were carried out from 24 to 30 November 2005 in Bhutan and \nNepal, from 24 to 26 February 2006 in Bangladesh, and from 29 to 31 March 2006 in India, to \nreach  agreement  with  the  governments  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and outline terms of reference of the RETA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In  many  developing  countries,  including  Bhutan,  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  and  India, \nincreased economic activity can have negative impacts on the environment. Economic activities \nassociated  with  industry,  agriculture,  health  services,  and  other  service  sectors  generate \nchemical and hazardous wastes, which if left unmanaged, can lead to serious environmental \nproblems that threaten public health and endanger economic sustainability.  \n \n4.  Problems associated with the management of waste, especially hazardous waste, vary \nin the four RETA member countries. In Bhutan, where the environment is still intact and pristine, \nproblems associated with hazardous waste are emerging slowly but steadily.2 Bhutan is still in \nthe  preliminary  stage  with  regard  to  hazardous  waste  management.  A  proper  system  for \nhazardous waste collection, separation, transportation, and disposal needs to be put in place \nbefore public health is threatened. Although several studies have been carried out to assess the \nimproper management of hazardous wastes, Bhutan has not yet established institutional and \nlegal frameworks to effectively address the problem. In Nepal, several studies and workshops \non managing hazardous wastes have been carried out, and the hazardous, polluting industries \nand  activities  have  been  identified.3 Nepal\u2019s  next  step  is  to  develop  policies  under  the \nEnvironmental Protection Act. In Bangladesh, pollution associated with industrial activities has \nbeen identified as a major environmental concern.4 Some rivers have been severely polluted. \nThe  industrial  activities  have  contributed  to  the  increase  of  wastes  disposed  into  the \nenvironment. The Bangladesh Environmental Conservation Act and Rules have put in place \nmeasures  to  address  pollution  problems;  however,  a  clear  strategy  and  policy  as  well  as \npractical  guidance  have  not  yet  been  established.  India,  on  the  other  hand,  has  a \ncomprehensive regulatory and institutional framework, as well as technical guidelines to handle \nvarious types of hazardous wastes. However, increasing industrial activities are also facing \nsignificant challenges in disposing of hazardous wastes, and therefore more appropriate and \nmodern facilities are required. \n \n5.  The governments have taken steps to minimize pollution associated with chemical and \nhazardous wastes, not only at the country level, but also internationally, as parties of the Basel \n                                                 \n1  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 10 August 2006.   \n2  National Environment Commission, 1999. Environmental Assessment of Existing Industries in Bhutan. \n3  Ministry of Population and Environment. 2004. Initial Inventory of Hazardous and Toxic Wastes. Nepal. \n4  United Nations Environment Programme. 2001.  State of the Environment.  \n   Available: http://www.rrcap.unep.org/reports/soe/bhutan_toc.pdf \n ", "2   \nConvention on Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal, and the \nStockholm  Convention  on  Persistent  Organic  Pollutants.5 As  parties  of  these  conventions, \nBhutan, Nepal, and Bangladesh have benefited from training and seminars. In addition, Bhutan \nwas able to export around 32.19 metric tons of obsolete pesticides to Switzerland for treatment \nand safe disposal. However, while these conventions extend invaluable assistance to their \nparties, they also impose strict obligations. Such obligations include undertaking real efforts at \nthe country level to handle chemical and hazardous wastes prior to ratification. The goal is to \ncombine their efforts to reduce pollution associated with chemical and hazardous wastes.  \n \n6.  The  five  main  steps  in  managing  hazardous  wastes  at  the  national  level 6  are  \n(i)  identifying  the  problems;  (ii)  designating  a  lead  agency;  (iii)  promulgating  rules  and \nregulations; (iv) developing treatment and disposal facilities; and (v) creating compliance and \nenforcement  programs.  Clearly,  the  four  RETA  member  countries  need  different  levels  of \ninterventions to institutionalize the management of hazardous wastes. Bhutan would need to  \n(i) complete a national inventory of the types and quantities of hazardous wastes, (ii) draft policy \nto cover the institutional and regulatory framework to manage hazardous wastes, (iii) develop \nappropriate  technical  guidelines  for  hazardous  waste  management,  and  (iv)  develop  a \nmechanism for institutional strengthening and capacity development. Bangladesh and Nepal \nwould need to (i) update their hazardous waste inventories as a basis for promulgating rules \nand regulations; and (ii) develop technical guidelines on handling, treating, transporting, and \ndisposing hazardous wastes as a basis to identify the potential amount and type of wastes that \nneed special treatment and disposal facilities. Meanwhile, India needs to (i) review the capacity \nof  its  hazardous  waste  treatment  facilities,  including  facilities  involving  public-private \npartnerships; (ii) review the existing institutional and regulatory framework to create effective \ncompliance programs by taking into account that some hazardous wastes have economic value; \nand (iii) build capacity by organizing trainings that will also be shared with other RETA member \ncountries. \n \n7.  Considering the range of issues, problems, degrees of effort, and the immediate needs \nfor managing hazardous wastes, this RETA will serve as a basis for strengthening cooperation \namong  the  four  countries.  Cooperation  will  be  fostered  not  only  through  the  sharing  of \nknowledge,  but  also  through  the  identification  of  ways  to  use  common  facilities  for  safely \ntreating,  transporting,  and  disposing  hazardous  wastes.  In  sharing  knowledge,  Bhutan, \nBangladesh,  and  Nepal  will  benefit  from  India\u2019s  lessons  in  regulating  the  management  of \nhazardous wastes. Ultimately, these four countries are expected to have compatible rules and \nguidelines on managing hazardous wastes. In terms of using common facilities, India has \nalready made efforts to explore the participation of the private sector in facilitating the disposal \nof hazardous wastes in these countries. India will benefit also from knowing which hazardous \nwastes  will  potentially  be  generated  by  its  neighboring  countries.  In  this  context,  future \ninvestment in common treatment facilities for hazardous wastes may be feasible. Therefore, it is \nclear that the activities developed under this RETA will be consistent with the program and \nobjective of the RCSP 2006\u20132008.  \n \n                                                 \n5  Out of the four RETA member countries, only India has ratified these three international conventions. \n6  Center for Risk Management. 1999.

The RETA will assist the four member countries to improve and develop policy and \nregulations to effectively manage hazardous wastes. Therefore, it is expected that the RETA will \ncontribute to the overall reduction of pollution related with hazardous wastes. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  To achieve the main outcomes, the following outputs and activities have been identified. \n \n10.  Output 1: Waste inventory reports for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. Inventories \nof hazardous wastes will be completed for Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The types and \nquantities of hazardous wastes will be recorded for each country. As part of the inventory \nprocess, the consultants will review existing information on waste generation sources, examine \nlessons from other countries, conduct field surveys, and hold local workshops with potential \nstakeholders. They will also identify who is doing what and who will be expected to do what, \nincluding identifying the gaps and needs for improving management of hazardous wastes. On \nthis basis, the institutional framework to manage hazardous wastes will be strengthened and \ndeveloped.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Draft policy and rules to manage hazardous waste for Bangladesh, \nBhutan,  and  Nepal.  In  formulating  policy  and  rules  for  managing  hazardous  wastes  in \nBangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal, the hazardous waste inventories will be used as a basis for (i) \nidentifying  specific  technical  procedures  for  treating,  storing,  transporting,  and  disposing \nhazardous waste; (ii) identifying wastes that will be subject to regulation; and (iii) identifying and \ndeveloping an appropriate institutional framework to manage hazardous wastes. The policies \nand rules of other countries, including India, will be studied, and local workshops will be held to \nallow stakeholders to voice their opinions. \n \n12.  Output 3: Report on India\u2019s hazardous waste regulations, with recommendations \non incorporating reuse and recycling principles. An in-depth review of India\u2019s regulations \nand  technical  guidelines  will  be  carried  out,  and  several  small  workshops  involving \nrepresentatives from waste generators will be held, to recommend practical and economical \nways to reuse and recycle waste. Although output 3 is designed specifically for India, the other \nRETA member countries will also benefit if their inventories identify hazardous wastes that can \nbe reused or recycled. \n \n13.  Output  4.  Report  on  potential  involvement  of  private  sector  in  managing \nhazardous wastes. The potential involvement of the private sector in managing hazardous \nwastes will be explored through the following: (i) visits to treatment and disposal facilities in the \nregion that have been built and/or operated by the private sector, (ii) assessment of existing \nfinancial facilities, (iii) seminars and workshops to gather inputs from relevant stakeholders, and \n(iv) outputs from RETA 6292: Promoting Environmental Investment in Asia and the Pacific.7 \nThese activities are expected to be used as a basis to develop a business proposal for private \nsector involvement in handling hazardous wastes.  \n \n                                                 \n7  RETA 6292 (ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Promoting Environmental Investment in Asia and the Pacific.  \nManila), approved 28 December. \n ", "4   \n14.  Output 5: Training modules for managing hazardous wastes. Training modules that \nprovide instruction on preparing inventories and developing technical and procedural guidelines \nfor hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities will be developed.  \n \n15.  The  RETA  design  is  based  on  several  assumptions  essential  for  successful \nimplementation: (i) regional workshops for sharing knowledge between RETA member countries \non handling hazardous wastes are carried out on time; (ii) each government will consistently \nsupport the inventory of wastes; (iii) each government will consistently support the formulation of \nguidelines/regulations  that  will  reduce  pollution  associated  with  hazardous  wastes;  (iv) \ncoordination  among  the  departments  that  contribute  to  generating  hazardous  wastes  is \nestablished; and (v) relevant stakeholders, such as financial agencies and waste generators, \nactively participate. \n \n16.  Output 6: Mechanism to maintain network among member countries. It is also \nexpected that the RETA will enable these four countries to establish and maintain a hazardous \nwaste network for future cooperation and knowledge sharing. In this context, the RETA will also \nbe implemented in line with ADB\u2019s efforts in developing knowledge hubs under ADB\u2019s RETA on \nEstablishment of Regional Knowledge Hubs.8 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $424,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program for $400,000. The participating governments will provide \noffice accommodation, counterpart staff, and miscellaneous expenses equivalent to $24,000. \nThe TA will finance two regional workshops, eight country trainings and workshops, international \nand national consulting services, and three computers and printers for activities in Bangladesh, \nBhutan, and Nepal. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  RETA  and  will  work  closely  with  the \nenvironment  ministries  of  the  participating  countries.  In-country  focal  points  will  be  \n(1) Bangladesh\u2019s Department of Environment, Ministry of Environment and Forest; (ii) Bhutan\u2019s \nNational  Environment  Commission;  (iii)  Nepal\u2019s  Environmental  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment, Science, and Technology; and (iv) India\u2019s Ministry of Environment and Forest.   \n \n19.  One international consultant with expertise in hazardous waste management (4 person-\nmonths) will be recruited on an intermittent basis. National consultants (30 person-months; \naverage 7.5 person-months for each country) will also be recruited on an intermittent basis. \nNational  consultants  will  include  (i)  hazardous  waste  management  specialists  for  all  four \ncountries; (ii) environmental policy specialists for Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal; and (iii) a \npublic-private partnership  specialist for India. The international consultant will work closely with \nall national consultants and will act as resource person in undertaking waste inventory as well \nas in developing guidelines/rules for managing hazardous wastes, including exploring the role of \nthe private sector in managing hazardous wastes and formulating guidelines and policies. The \nnational hazardous waste management specialists will carry out the inventory of hazardous \nwastes and will work closely with the international consultant to develop guidelines to manage \nhazardous  wastes.  The  national  environmental  policy  specialists  will  be  responsible  for \n                                                 \n8  RETA 6295 (ADB. 2005.

The national private sector consultant will \nexplore  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  waste  management  and  develop  guidelines  that \nencourage greater participation. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006). \nComputers will be purchased locally and after the completion of the RETA will be granted to the \nimplementing  agencies  in  Bhutan,  Bangladesh,  and  Nepal,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2006). \n \n20.  The RETA will be implemented over 12 months, beginning in January 2007. For each \ncountry, the national consultant will submit (i) an inception report within 4 weeks, (ii) brief \nmonthly progress reports, (iii) a brief midterm report, and (iv) a final report (hard and soft copies) \nat the end of the RETA. The international consultant will submit (i) an inception report within 3 \nweeks, (ii) progress reports after completing assignments related to RETA milestones, and (iii) a \nfinal report that summarizes the activities and recommendations of the national consultants. \nNational  workshops  will  be  held  to  allow  stakeholders  to  voice  concerns,  and  regional \nworkshops will be held to share lessons and best practices of countries in the region.  \n     \nIV.
