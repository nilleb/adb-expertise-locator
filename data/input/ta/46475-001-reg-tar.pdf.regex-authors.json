The 14 Pacific developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) are fragile to varying degrees and depend heavily on trade and other international \neconomic  ties  for  consumable  goods,  export  markets,  and  finance.  Except  for  the  largest \nenergy- and mineral-exporters, economies in the subregion continue to perform poorly. This \nboth contributes to and reflects fragility, arising from their remoteness, narrow resources bases, \nand  limited  scope  for  economies  of  scale,  as  highlighted  in  ADB  country  performance \nassessments. Strategy 2020 notes the acute challenges fragile countries face because of their \ngenerally  weak  policy  regimes,  small  domestic  markets,  economic  vulnerability,  and  weak \ninstitutions.1 It adds that ADB must align its development assistance with other funding agencies \nat the strategic and project level and pursue capacity and institutional development with more \ndepth, flexibility, and longer engagement (footnote 1). This technical assistance (TA) aligns with \nthe strategy in response to ongoing economic monitoring and analysis of the 14 Pacific DMCs. \nPacific Department management and staff discussed the TA with DMC government officials and \ndevelopment partner representatives over the course several missions and meetings, though no \nmission was conducted exclusively for this purpose.2  \n \n2.   An article in ADB\u2019s Pacific Economic Monitor assessed changes in North Pacific DMCs\u2019 \nglobal trade and other economic links.3 The evolution of economic links in recent decades as \ndiscussed in the article attracted considerable interest from DMC policy makers, who particularly \nfocused on the question of how global economic developments are likely to influence the Pacific \nin coming decades and how policy can strengthen these links and help Pacific DMCs to capture \nthe benefits of enhanced international ties in support of national and subregional development. \nThe article highlighted the limitations of using readily available data on Pacific countries to \nanalyze the development of economic links. Pacific DMC governments and key development \npartners in the subregion, such as the Asian Development Bank Institute and the Australian \nAgency for International Development, expressed interest in working with ADB to extend the \nresearch.  \n \n3.  The TA will respond to the need for better information on these economic links to guide \nADB and other development partner assistance, and to help shape the policies and strategies of \nPacific  DMCs  to  reflect  and  respond  to  changing  opportunities  from,  for  example,  the \ndevelopment of the internet and the falling cost of transporting goods by sea. The TA will help \nPacific DMCs improve their economic monitoring and policy formulation to foster countries\u2019 \nproductive engagement in an increasingly integrated global economy. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Adapting to evolving economic conditions (e.g., changing trade costs, shifts in trade \npartners\u2019 economies, and a changing global and regional financial landscape) in an increasingly \nintegrated  and  rapidly  changing  global  economy  challenges  small  and  remote  developing \neconomies  in  the  Pacific.  While  Pacific  economies  are  generally  open,  posing  few  formal \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila \n2  A concept design review meeting for the TA convened on 24 October 2012. The proposal was discussed and, after \nsome editing, approved by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Community of Practice for support under the \nRegional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  in  December  of  2012.  The  TA  first  appeared  in  the  business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 May 2013. \n3  ADB. 2012. Pacific Economic Monitor (December 2012). Manila.  North Pacific DMCs refer to the Federal States of \nMicronesia, the Republic of Marshall Islands, and Palau. \n ", "2  \nbarriers to trade and only moderate restrictions on investment, nontariff and institutional barriers \nto international trade and commerce persist. Constraints emerging from governments\u2019 lack of \ncapacity to efficiently facilitate and oversee trade and investment must be urgently addressed. \nPacific  DMC  leaders  have  fully  embraced  the  goal  of  furthering  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration (RCI), which reflects their collective understanding of the importance of RCI to the \nwell-being of the subregion. The clearest evidence of this is provisions under ADB\u2019s Pacific \nApproach, 2010\u20132014 to strengthen RCI, first endorsed by the Pacific countries in 2005.4  \n \n5.  High dependence on trade and the low availability of capital make the potential benefits \nof RCI to Pacific DMCs clear, as it would enable them to achieve economies of scale by \ncombining national efforts in public service provision, private sector investment, and tourism \ndevelopment. RCI could also provide important benefits by pooling risk and encouraging market \ncompetition that lowers prices and improves the quality and variety of goods and services \navailable in the subregion. Many regional challenges such as controlling pandemics, sustainably \nmanaging Pacific fisheries, and adapting to rising sea levels can be effectively addressed only \nthrough the combined efforts of all countries in the subregion. \n \n6.  Rapidly rising engagement with new economic partners and international organizations, \nas fast-growing Asian economies engage in greater commerce and investment in the Pacific, \nrequires Pacific governments to acquire new knowledge and skills for dealing with the unfamiliar \ntrade and investment practices of emerging trade and investment partners in Asia, such as \ndifferences in accounting standards and legal procedures related to investment and financial \ntransfers.  Governments  face  acute  difficulties  in  securing  and  retaining  skilled  officials  to \noversee  new  economic  relations  because  of  their  limited  human  resource  bases  and  the \nfrequent departure of skilled workers for higher-paid positions abroad. The primary goals of the \nTA are to generate more and better economic analyses of evolving trade, financial, and labor \nmarket  ties  through  TA-sponsored  economic  research;  build  capacity  during  collaboration \nbetween Pacific and international researchers under the TA; and disseminate research outputs. \n \n7.  Infrastructure development in the Pacific, including work supported by ADB, is creating \nnew opportunities that require complementary actions to enhance Pacific country capacity to \nfacilitate trade and investment. This includes advice and assistance in (i) creating business \nenvironments  to  make  countries  attractive  to  international  investors  for  their  productive \nadvantages other than low wages or lax environmental controls; (ii) improving communication \nthrough infrastructure development and upgraded institutional capacity; (iii) enhancing countries\u2019 \nability to efficiently comply with international standards of customs administration, banking and \nfinancial  management,  and  accounting;  and  (iv)  familiarizing  countries  with  the  business \npractices and expectations of new trading and investment partners and coordinating business \nregulation. Subsequent TA is expected to focus more on building capacity in these areas guided \nby research and data generated by the TA. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  Global economic restructuring is rapidly changing economic links between Pacific DMCs \nand their traditional and emerging partners outside the subregion in terms of (i) commodity, \nmerchandise, and trade services including tourism; (ii) financial and investment flows including \ndevelopment assistance; and (iii) labor migration and remittances. The TA will support applied \nresearch and the compilation and generation of data to better inform Pacific countries about \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n ", "  3\nthese changes as they navigate changing economic circumstances within the subregion and \nfurther afield. Research will develop Pacific DMCs\u2019 understanding of the implications of RCI and \nchanging economic links and the practical steps they can take to adapt to and benefit from this \nchanging environment. Research initiatives will be crafted to address the interests of Pacific \nDMC  policy  makers  with  operationally  focused  policy  advice.  The  research  will  address \nprospects for deepening and diversifying economic relationships, the implications of the Asian \nCentury  on  the  economies  of  the  Pacific,  and  lessons  from  the  trade  and  investment \nexperiences  of  other  small  island  economies.5 Capacity  will  be  built  through  collaboration \nbetween  international  and  national  economists  in  conducting  the  research  and  later  by \nsupporting  countries\u2019  implementation  of  the  policy  recommendations  arising  from  research \nwithin the framework of enhanced RCI road maps.  \n \n9.  The TA will advise and assist Pacific DMCs on policies needed to adjust to closer \nregional and international integration and on how to respond to the challenges and opportunities \nthe integration brings. Improved RCI road maps for individual Pacific DMCs and associated \nplans  for  capacity  building  to  assist  Pacific  country  engagement  with  emerging  economic \npartners in trade, finance, and labor market cooperation and/or integration will be supported \nunder  the  TA.  Pacific  DMCs\u2019  communication  with  bilateral  and  multilateral  organizations \nengaged in trade and investment facilitation will be improved through training and experience \nsharing between Pacific countries, and between the Pacific and other subregions that have \nmade greater progress in RCI with ADB assistance. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA will enhance RCI within and beyond the Pacific by improving understanding of \nhow the Pacific\u2019s economic linkages have evolved and what the most serious barriers to greater \nintegration have been. Improving the availability of indicators for tracking progress in economic \nintegration will support future RCI efforts. The impact of the TA will be measured by the annual \ncompilation of integration indicators and by research reports and evidence of the uptake of \nresearch results in the Pacific. \n \n11.  The outcome will be improved availability of indicators and knowledge products on the \neconomic linkages in Pacific DMCs and the opportunities and barriers to greater RCI in the \nregion. The TA will help strengthen Pacific DMCs\u2019 ability to plan and manage their economies in \nthe face of changing international economic environment and improve Pacific stakeholders\u2019 \nunderstanding of ongoing economic transformations and future developments in links joining the \nPacific, Asia, and the broader global economy. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will conduct focused research that will produce reports examining the experience \nand structural potential of selected Pacific countries to engage and integrate in key areas of \neconomic activity: (i) imports to Pacific DMCs, (ii) exports from Pacific DMCs, (iii) trade in \ntourism and other services, (iv) investment and financial flows, (v) development assistance \nflows, and (vi) labor migration and remittances. By compiling and analyzing available indicators \nof country activity in these areas, and by working to enhance indicator availability in the future, \nresearch under the TA will provide to Pacific countries and development organizations working \nwith them a more nuanced understanding of these economic relationships and their evolution \nover recent decades. The research will examine the trends, drivers, opportunities, and factors \n                                                 \n5  H.S. Kohli et al. 2011. Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century.

Improved  understanding  will  facilitate  the \nformulation of improved national development policies and strategies to respond to and take \nadvantage of the changing global economic landscape. \n \n13.  How to characterize changes in the strength of economic ties between countries is well \nestablished. The toolkit of analytical approaches well suited to this research includes basic \ndescriptive statistical analysis of compiled indicators related to the defined areas of linkage, the \ncalculation of trade intensity and revealed comparative advantage indicators, and econometric \nexamination of drivers of evolving economic linkage, such as the gravity model estimation \nframework. The main research challenges relate to the timeliness and coverage of available \nindicators and to sustaining government counterpart interest and engagement in the planned \nresearch and the dissemination of research results. To address the risk that existing data will be \ninadequate to enable tracking past and future progress in economic integration and its drivers \nand  consequences,  the  TA  will  develop  new  indicators  and  detailed  plans  to  enhance \nintegration indicators available to Pacific DMCs in the coming years. \n \n14.   Because of the large number of Pacific DMCs and distinct areas of economic linkage \nthat will be examined under this TA, it would be unwise to attempt to cover all DMCs and topics \nin the initial phase of what is expected to be a long-term stream of research. Accordingly, the TA \nwill focus on a few country and linkage-area pairings with particular relevance or high availability \nof data. The table summarizes an initial set of planned studies that will be discussed and \nfinalized during the planned project inception workshop.  \n \nPlanned Studies under the Technical Assistance \nInvestment  Trade \nDevelopment  Labor and \nand  Services \nAssistance  Remittances Imports  Exports \nFinance  (Tourism) \nKiribati  Palau  Fiji  Fiji  Papua  Cook \nNew  Islands \nGuinea \nFederated  Papua New  Federated  Marshall  Samoa  Fiji \nStates of  Guinea  States of  Islands \nMicronesia  Micronesia \nNauru  Solomon  Samoa  Timor-Leste  Solomon  Palau \nIslands  Islands \n Source: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.

TA \nactivities will be coordinated with a number of other ongoing7 or planned TA projects.   \n \n17.  A team will be recruited for 37 person-months of consulting inputs on an intermittent \nbasis. The team will have a project coordinator (national, up to 16 person-months) and at least \nsix research economists (international, total of 21 person-months inputs, recruited on output-\nbased,  lump-sum  contracts)  with  expertise  in  foreign  direct  investment  and  international \nfinancial transfers, labor markets and migration, and trade (divided across import trade, export \ntrade, and trade in services with a focus on international tourism). Deliverables will include \nquarterly progress reports to be prepared by the project coordinator and six research reports \ndeveloped from a detailed outline including a literature review, an initial draft, and a final draft\u2014\neach with associated briefs outlining key policy issues identified in the main report. ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  Established ADB project monitoring and evaluation indicators will be applied to assess \nthe effectiveness of the TA, as broadly outlined in the design and monitoring framework. TA \ninception will refine the initial monitoring milestones presented in this report and provide the \nbases upon which TA performance can be judged. The indicators will expand on the general \nindicators suggested in the design and monitoring framework. During TA implementation, ADB \nwill convene semiannual reviews of TA implementation and effectiveness and seek external \nstakeholders\u2019 views on TA outputs. To facilitate this review, quarterly updates on TA progress \nand issues arising in implementation will be prepared by the project coordinator and submitted \nto ADB. Regional workshops convened as part of the TA will monitor progress achieved and \nguide future areas of focus. TA reports will be shared with development partners supporting \nrelated initiatives. These partners will be invited to participate in planned TA review meetings \nand collaborate with ADB-supported researchers to extend research outputs. \n \n19.  Research findings and other outputs such as plans for enhancing the availability of \neconomic  linkage  indicators  will  be  disseminated  through  TA  reports  to  be  shared  with \nstakeholders through regional workshops, country seminars, and publications including in the \nPacific Economic Monitor (footnote 3). \n \nIV.
