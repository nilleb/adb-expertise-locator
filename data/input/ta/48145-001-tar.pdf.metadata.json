INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Myanmar has articulated its intent to improve environment and \nnatural resources management and environmental governance, which is manifested in evolving \nnational regulatory and policy frameworks. Promulgation of the Environmental Conservation \nLaw  (2012)  demonstrates  a  firm  government  commitment  to  mainstreaming  environmental \nissues into national policies and planning, and development management processes. \n \n2.  The  mandate  and  role  of  the  recently  reconstituted  Ministry  of  Environmental \nConservation and Forestry (MOECAF) strongly emphasize sustainable natural resources and \nenvironmental quality management, with environmental quality management being addressed \nthrough the addition of an Environmental Conservation Department (ECD). \n \n3.  MOECAF\u2019s  shift  in  mandate  and  enhanced  role  has  important  implications  for \ninstitutional capacity in the short and long term. The government has requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) support to fill functional and technical \ncapability  gaps  to  contribute  to  MOECAF\u2019s  performance  and  mandate  delivery.  The  TA \nresponds to this expressed need to strengthen ECD\u2019s functional and technical capacity. The \ngovernment  has  concurred  with  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Balancing economic growth and environmental sustainability. Myanmar is at an \nimportant inflection point\u2014the success of its wide-ranging economic and political reforms will \ndepend on sustainable management and utilization of natural resources. If current economic \nreforms continue, the country\u2019s economy is on track to expand by 7%\u20138% in 2014 and in 2015.2 \nMuch of this growth is likely to be fueled by the country\u2019s rich endowment of natural resources, \nwith an inevitable upsurge in environmental pressures. Institutional and governance frameworks \nwill need to be strengthened to underpin environmental sustainability, help screen and mitigate \nrisks for country development strategies and investments, and mainstream climate change, \nbiodiversity, and ecosystem services into national policies, programs, and projects. \n \n5.  Policy and institutional context. The 2012 Environment Conservation Law and 2014 \nEnvironmental  Conservation  Rules  provide  the  legal  basis  for  implementing  a  range  of \nenhanced  environmental  management  measures.  Attention  now  needs  to  shift  to  drafting \ncorresponding regulations to enact legislation, including procedures and technical guidelines on \nenvironmental safeguards and pollution abatement. Developing regulations and guidelines and \ncreating  enabling  conditions  for  effective  implementation  will  require  substantial  effort  and \ntechnical  expertise.  Additionally,  government  capacity  to  undertake  environmental  impact \nassessment (EIA) review, monitoring, and compliance will need to be built and institutional \nlinkages forged to ensure necessary interagency coordination on environmental management. \n \n6.  Early ADB support for safeguards. Reflecting ECD\u2019s core functions, early priority was \ngiven to strengthening Myanmar\u2019s country safeguard system (CSS). ECD received a short-term \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 October 2014. \n2  ADB. 2014. Asian Development Outlook 2014 Update. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \nTA through ADB\u2019s regional TA3 and the Greater Mekong Subregion Core Environment Program \n(CEP).4 Under its TA for Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems (footnote 2), \nduring 2013\u20132014, ADB completed an assessment of the institutional setup for applying country \nsafeguards, delivered workshops introducing safeguards\u2019 good practice to MOECAF and the \nMinistry of Electric Power, and prepared a capacity development action plan. Substantial TA \nhas also been provided under CEP during 2012\u20132014 through ADB\u2019s Environment Operations \nCenter (EOC), involving (i) drafting a new EIA procedure to strengthen the project proposal \nreview process and ensure consistency with environmental assessment requirements set out in \nrelevant  laws,  rules,  and  notifications;  (ii)  preparing  environmental  quality  guidelines  for \napplication by approved projects in implementing environmental management plans and by \nMOECAF and other ministries in ambient environmental quality and pollution control monitoring; \nand (iii) preparing general EIA technical guidelines. \n \n7.  Strengthening environmental safeguards: The unfinished agenda. Notwithstanding \nthe recognized utility of the short-term TA to ECD, it is evident that the department requires a \nsubstantial, long-term capacity development program. Official development assistance projects, \nincluding projects submitted to the Myanmar Investment Commission5 will need to be screened \nand assessed based on the new EIA procedures prior to approval. Support is needed for ECD \nto have sufficiently trained staff to fulfill its mandated functions, including (i) EIA report review \nand approval, and project compliance monitoring responsibilities; (ii) pollution control, involving \nbuilding systems and human resource capacity for environmental quality guidelines application, \nmonitoring, and interpretation; and (iii) use of an environmental information system to support \ncountry environmental reporting. \n \n8.  The TA is designed to build on work completed under ADB\u2019s TA for Strengthening and \nUse of Country Safeguard Systems (footnote 2) and ongoing activities under ADB\u2019s TA for the \nCore Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Initiative in the Greater \nMekong Subregion, Phase 2,6 and will complement support for institutional strengthening and \ncapacity development on environmental and social safeguards for the Ministry of Construction \nunder  ADB\u2019s  TA  for  Strengthening  and  Use  of  Country  Safeguard  Systems  (footnote  2). \nRecognizing CEP\u2019s lead role in environmental safeguard strengthening in Myanmar and the \nformation of a national support unit to assist MOECAF in program implementation, the TA will \nbe provided in close collaboration with CEP and involve ongoing technical inputs from EOC \nspecialists. \n \n9.  Strategic partnerships: Adopting a harmonized approach. Given the nascent stage \nof  Myanmar\u2019s  environmental  management  systems,  there  is  a  clear  opportunity  for \nstrengthening coordination and harmonizing approaches using the safeguard policies of ADB \nand the World Bank as the appropriate benchmarks. The TA will coordinate with the World Bank, \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Strengthening and Use of Country Safeguard Systems.

The \nbody was re-established in 2011 as a 16-member committee to scrutinize economic proposals. As of June 2014, \nthere were over 260 proposals under review at MIC. \n6  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for the Core Environment Program and Biodiversity Conservation Corridors \nInitiative in the Greater Mekong Subregion, Phase 2. Manila (TA 7987-REG).  The TA implementation period is \n2012\u20132016 and is based on a 10-year program framework document (http://www.gms-eoc.org/resources/cep-\nprogram-framework-document-2012-2016-) \n ", "  3 \nthe Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the newly established environment sector \nworking group7 to support CSS development through joint efforts in strengthening MOECAF\u2019s \nimplementation capacity and adopting standard operating protocols for key sectors. \n \n10.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s country program. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  for  Myanmar,  to  be  extended  to  2016,  which  identifies \nenvironmental sustainability as a key theme to be mainstreamed into its operations.8 In line with \nthe Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, the TA will help strengthen governance and institutional \nmechanisms and mainstream international best practices on safeguards.9 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA impact will be sustained environmental quality across investment projects in key \nsectors. The outcome will be ECD national and state branches exhibit improved processes and \nprocedures for environmental assessments and review. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  proposes  a  comprehensive  capacity  development  program  to  expand \nenvironmental quality management capacity and capability within ECD and across relevant \nministries (e.g., agriculture and irrigation, construction, electric power, energy, industry, mines, \nrail, tourism, and transport). Capacity development will ensure a synergistic and coordinated \napproach  across  development  partners,  encompassing  regulatory  and  policy  framework, \nmanagerial and procedural capacity, and technical capacity. In allocating TA resources, priority \nwill be given to the following outputs. \n \n13.  Output 1: Enhanced environmental impact assessment framework and capacity \ndevelopment  plan  prepared.  The  TA  will  conduct  institutional  mapping  of  environmental \nmanagement needs and requirements, including assessing consistency of policy and legal \nframeworks and alignment with domestic laws, and conducting an institutional readiness and \ncapacity needs assessment. Mapping will also document links with outputs and outcomes of \nrecently completed and ongoing ADB CSS TA projects, alignment with environmental safeguard \nsupport being provided or planned by other development partners and the potential for adoption \nof  shared  safeguard  approaches,  and  anticipated  future  regional  convergence  on  country \nsafeguard  requirements.  Based  on  these  assessments,  the  TA  will  prepare  a  capacity \ndevelopment action plan for ECD, sector ministries, and ADB project staff. \n \n14.  Output 2: Comprehensive environmental quality management training program \ndelivered. The TA will provide comprehensive support for environmental safeguard application, \nfocusing  on  the  introduction  of  administrative  and  technical  review  systems,  capacity \ndevelopment and provision of expert advice for EIA review, and EIA implementation, including \nintegrating gender issues in EIA procedure and technical guidelines, issuing environmental \ncompliance  certificates,  preparing  and  overseeing  construction  and  operational  phase  of \n                                                \n7  The Myanmar Environmental Sector Working Group (ESWG) was established in 2013 and is one of 16 different \nsector working groups set up to ensure multi-stakeholder coordination. The ESWG is currently co-chaired by \nMOECAF, UN-HABITAT and the Government of Norway. \n8  ADB. 2012. Interim Country Partnership Strategy: Myanmar, 2012\u20132014. Manila. \n9  ADB. 2014.

EIA capacity development will \nprimarily target national and state level officers and ECD staff and involve seminars, workshops, \nand  on-the-job  training  to  develop  competency  on  environmental  safeguard  application. \nAdditional training on EIA procedure\u2014and on sector guidelines to be prepared by ECD with \nsector  involvement\u2014will  be  delivered  to  technical  and  senior  officials  in  sector  ministries, \nincluding the Ministry of Electric Power, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Construction, \nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, and the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural \nDevelopment, as well as other target audiences (e.g., Union Attorney General\u2019s Office) as \nrequested. Subnational entities will also be targeted selectively in ADB\u2019s areas of operation.10 \nThe overall training program design and delivery strategy will be crafted in close consultation \nwith, and seek to amalgamate CSS support from, other development partners. The TA outputs \nwill provide the basis for longer-term ADB CSS support in Myanmar and contribute to existing \njoint development partner efforts on safeguard harmonization. \n \n15.  The CDTA will deliver training to MOECAF and other ministries which are likely to have \na mandate to conduct strategic environmental assessment (SEA)11\u2014introducing concepts and \nrationale,  methods  and  tools,  regulatory  frameworks  for  implementation,  and  effective \nintegration of environmental considerations into planning processes. Training is expected to \nresult in better understanding of different approaches to environmental assessments of plans \nand programs, increased knowledge of SEA methods and tools, and contribute to progressive \nadoption and application of SEA by government ministries. \n \n16.  Output 3: Improved environmental monitoring, information-sharing, and reporting \ndocumented. The TA will extend the ECD environmental information portal developed by CEP \nand to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2014. This portal is designed to host environmental \nstate and trend data and statistics as interactive charts and graphs, as well as maps, reports, \nand other resources. Myanmar\u2019s new EIA procedure provides that project assessment reports \ncan be made available through the portal. ECD is responsible for ongoing portal maintenance, \nwhereas the TA will enable data collection and processing, ensuring that the portal contributes \nto improved access to and dissemination of information. The environmental information portal \nwill improve public access to information and provide a sound basis for environmental reporting, \nincluding  periodic  country  state  of  environment  reports  and  ADB  country  performance \nassessments.  Logistical  considerations  related  to  portal  functionality,  such  as  subnational \ninternet technology infrastructure, will be informed by outputs of ADB\u2019s TA for Design of e-\nGovernance Master Plan and Review of Information and Communication Technology Capacity \nin Academic Institutions.12 The TA will carefully map logistical and technical support gaps. While \nCEP  intends  to  migrate  the  portal  to  ECD  soon  after  launch,  an  off-line  system  may  be \nintroduced as an interim measure, and preparations have been made to host the portal on the \nCEP webserver should Myanmar\u2019s internet technology infrastructure (electricity, servers, and \ninternet technology staff for maintenance) not allow for a reliable portal operation. \n \n                                                \n10  For example, training recipients will include the executing agency (Mandalay Regional Government) and the \nimplementing agency (Mandalay City Development Committee) of ADB\u2019s proposed Mandalay City Urban Services \nImprovement Project. Project preparatory TA is ongoing (TA 8472-MYA).  \n11 SEA  is  a  systematic  decision  support  process,  aiming  to  ensure  that  environmental  and  possibly  other \nsustainability aspects are considered effectively in policy, plan and program-making. The inclusion of SEA support \nunder the TA reflects its integration in the new EIA procedures. \n12 ADB. 2013.

Manila (TA \n8398-MYA). \n ", "  5 \n17.  A specific activity under this output is the preparation of an ADB country environmental \nanalysis (CEA). Drawing from the environmental information portal, the CEA will systematically \nevaluate development-related natural resources and environmental management trends and \nissues.13 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, data collection, and \nother in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimate is presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The ECD, in MOECAF, will serve as the executing agency for the TA. The TA will train \nstaff from the Ministry of Electric Power, the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Construction, \nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, and the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural \nDevelopment through customized modules and orientation exercises. TA consultants will be \nbased at ECD while in country. ADB\u2019s EOC in Bangkok, as part of the CEP, will provide \ntechnical backstopping and support on EIA and SEA training, geographic information systems, \nand spatial planning. \n \n20.  ADB  will engage international (total of 25 person-months) and national (total of 30 \nperson-months)  consultants  to  carry  out  planned  activities.  An  international  environmental \nsafeguards  specialist  (12  person-months)  will  support  strengthening  of  environmental \nsafeguards  under  output  1.  International  pollution  control  (6  person-months)  and  national \nenvironmental monitoring (12 person-months) specialists will support environmental regulation \nand enforcement under output 2. A national environmental information and database specialist \n(18 person-months) will support the environmental information system and provide inputs to the \nCEA, and an international natural resources and environment specialist (7 person-months) will \nprepare the CEA under output 3. The consultants will be recruited through individual consultant \nselection and will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 34 months, from 1 March 2015 to 31 December 2017. \nThe  project  team  will  monitor  implementation  through  semiannual  reviews  and  in  close \ncoordination with ADB\u2019s Myanmar Resident Mission, with support from EOC. \n \nIV.
