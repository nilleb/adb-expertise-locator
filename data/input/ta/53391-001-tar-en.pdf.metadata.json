INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of \nthe Strategy for Promoting Safe and Environment-Friendly Agro-Based Value Chains in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion and Siem Reap Action Plan, which was endorsed by the agriculture \nministers of the countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) in September 2017.1 The TA \nwill build on the achievements of phase 1 (2006\u20132012) and phase 2 (2012\u20132019) of the GMS \nCore Agriculture Support Program, help create enabling conditions, and strengthen the capacity \nfor leveraging knowledge and investments in three priority areas: (i) climate-smart, inclusive, and \ngender-responsive agri-food value chains; (ii) food safety and quality systems; and (iii) climate-\nadaptive agriculture in the context of the water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus.2 \n \n2.  The TA is strongly aligned with two operational priorities of the Strategy 2030 of the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)\u2014promoting  rural  development  and  food  security,  and  fostering \nregional cooperation and integration.3 It is also aligned with other operational priorities of ADB, \nsuch as reducing remaining poverty and inequities; accelerating progress in gender equality; \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability; and strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The TA is included in the \ncountry operations business plans of the GMS countries.4 The TA will support GMS countries in \ntheir efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 1, SDG 2, \nand SDG 13, and their nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement on Climate \nChange5. By bolstering capacity and enabling policies, and demonstrating innovative activities, \nthe TA will contribute to the development of climate-smart agricultural investments and help \nrealize the GMS vision of a more integrated, prosperous, and equitable subregion.6 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Agriculture remains crucial to the GMS. More than 70% of the rural population directly \ndepends on it for their livelihoods. Women make a vital contribution either as farmers, or \nagricultural laborers or entrepreneurs. Growth in agriculture has driven the rapid expansion of \nGMS economies since the 1990s and helped generate substantial commodity exports. Intra-GMS \ntrade, including agricultural trade, grew from $5 billion (2.0% of total trade by GMS countries) in \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2018.

The water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus means that water \nsecurity, energy security, and food security are very much linked to one another, meaning that the actions in any one \nparticular area often have effects in one or both of the other areas. \n3  ADB. 2018.

The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 October \n2019. \n ", "2 \n1992 to $483 billion (9.3%) in 2017.7 The potential for agriculture to further increase intra-GMS \ntrade volumes is high. \n \n4.  Infrastructure and capacity barriers along the agricultural value chains. Realizing \nthe GMS vision of becoming a leading supplier of safe, quality, and climate-friendly agri-food \nproducts requires the removal of key infrastructure and capacity barriers along the value chains. \nPoor rural infrastructure, and many but fragmented small-scale farmers and small and medium-\nsized agribusinesses have led to high inefficiencies in energy, water, and waste management \nalong the value chain. Low investments in rural infrastructure resulted in high production costs, \nlow crop yields, and low profitability for farmers and agribusinesses. An October 2019 report \nestimated that annual agricultural investments of $78.6 billion are needed to reduce the proportion \nof hungry people in Asia and the Pacific below 5% of the total population by 2030.8 Low awareness \nof  and  limited  access  to  affordable  financing  for  agribusinesses  and  female  agricultural \nentrepreneurs also continue to constrain growth, productivity, and competitiveness. \n \n5.  Food safety and quality concerns. Rising concerns about food scares and foodborne \ndisease outbreaks have raised GMS consumer awareness of the importance of food safety and \nquality. The World Health Organization estimated that Southeast Asia had 150 million cases of \nfoodborne illnesses each year from 2005 to 2015. The GMS is particularly prone to an increase \nin health risks from the rising volumes of informal trade in agri-food products across GMS borders \nwith little control over quality and safety. Demand for safe and quality food by urban populations \nand tourists is growing in all GMS countries, but the lack of harmonized safety and quality \nassurance systems, ineffective control of transboundary animal diseases, and antimicrobial \nresistance constrain the GMS potential for agri-food exports. ADB support for sanitary and \nphytosanitary  measures  to  facilitate  GMS  trade  has  increased  the  technical  capacity  for \nsurveillance and inspection and thus helps ensure plant and animal health as well as food safety,9 \nbut much needs to be done to promote cross-border cooperation and harmonization of sanitary \nand phytosanitary measures and practices. Boosting subregional cooperation under the One \nHealth Initiative serves to maximize synergies between the human, animal, and environmental \nhealth systems; and to consolidate health security as a regional public good that benefits people \nacross the subregion.10 \n \n6.  Climate change and water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus. Agriculture is the sector most \nvulnerable to climate change. In Thailand and Viet Nam, for example, ADB projected climate \nchange to reduce rice yields by 50% and gross domestic product by 7% by 2050 if no concerted \nactions are taken.11 At the same time, Agriculture contributes significantly to climate change, \naccounting for about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Projections suggest that annual \ngreenhouse gas emissions from agriculture should be reduced by as much as 75% to limit global \nwarming to below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures. Agriculture is also the largest consumer \nof water, still accounting for nearly 70% of overall consumption despite growing urbanization and \nindustrialization. By 2030, overall demand for water and energy is projected to increase by 40%, \nand agriculture is expected to produce 30%\u201350% more food. Water, energy, and food security \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2018. Statistics in the Greater Mekong Subregion Growth, Tourism, and Health. 4th ed.

Climate change and \nunsustainable agricultural practices are expected to worsen water scarcity, limit productivity, and \nreduce water availability in areas with high irrigation demand. Promoting agricultural adaptation \nin the context of the water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus is therefore critical.  \n \n7.  Market access. Weak policy and regulatory frameworks, poor knowledge and capacity of \nstakeholders,  ineffective  uptake  of  suitable  technology,  and  inadequate  financing  limit \nopportunities for the GMS to achieve better market access and economies of scale for safe, \ninclusive, and climate-smart agri-food products. Insufficient cooperation on cross-border issues, \nregional public goods, and harmonization of agri-food quality and safety standards also hampers \nprogress in effectively integrating the subregion into global agribusiness markets. \n \n8.  Overcoming these barriers requires targeted capacity building; policy support to mobilize \ninvestments  in  inclusive,  climate-smart,  and  gender-responsive  agri-food  value  chains; \nawareness of options to access sustainable and affordable financing for small and medium-sized \nagribusinesses; and measures to harmonize food safety and quality standards. Introducing \nclimate-adaptive  agricultural  practices  and  technology  is  critical  to  accommodate  multiple \nobjectives in the water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus. \n \n9.  Core Agriculture Support Program. The two phases of the Core Agriculture Support \nProgram provide a sound basis for further regional cooperation on knowledge sharing and \ndialogue; agri-food policy initiatives and analytical work for better governance, efficiency, and \nequity; search for potential agri-food investments; and inputs for preparation of project concept \npapers and flagship knowledge products. Key successes of phase 1 were (i) greater technical \ncapacity to implement sanitary and phytosanitary measures, (ii) the GMS Agriculture Information \nNetwork Service, and (iii) a trade facilitation study on customs and quarantine procedures at GMS \nborders. Phase 2 focused on (i) food safety and trade facilitation, (ii) climate-friendly agriculture, \nand  (iii)  bioenergy  and  biomass  management.  It  also  supported  agricultural  research  and \ntechnology, private sector involvement, and institutional mechanisms. \n \n10.  After assessing progress achieved under the Core Agriculture Support Program, the GMS \nWorking Group on Agriculture (WGA), at its 16th Annual Meeting held in Louangphabang in June \n2019, prioritized six themes for support from ADB and other development partners:12 (i) promoting \ngreen, inclusive, and gender-responsive agri-food value chains; (ii) facilitating climate-smart \nagribusiness  financing;  (iii)  enhancing  food  safety  and  quality  standards,  certification,  and \ntraceability; (iv) improving cross-border animal health and value chains; (v) managing water and \nsoil for enhanced food security in a changing climate; and (vi) adapting agriculture to climate \nchange in the context of the water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus. \n \n11.  Through targeted demonstration activities, and policy, advisory, and knowledge support, \nthe TA will help identify transactions and build a pipeline of investment projects for ADB and the \nprivate sector with a focus on climate-smart agriculture,13 agribusiness, horticulture, and livestock \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2019. Record of Discussion of the 16th Annual Meeting of the Working Group on Agriculture. Louangphabang. \nThe WGA comprises senior officials from the agriculture ministries of each GMS country. Under the framework of \nthe GMS program, the WGA sets the strategic direction and provides inputs to implement the GMS Strategy for \nPromoting Safe and Environment-Friendly Agro-Based Value Chains in the Greater Mekong Subregion and Siem \nReap Action Plan. The WGA reports to the GMS ministers at the GMS ministerial meetings and the GMS summit. \nThe GMS and WGA organizational and reporting structure is in Appendix 4 of the GMS Strategy (footnote 1). \n13 An approach to sustainably increase agricultural productivity and incomes, adapt and build resilience to climate \nchange, and reduce or remove greenhouse gas emissions, where possible. \n ", "4 \nvalue chains in the GMS. It will also complement and support investments in climate-friendly \nagribusiness value chains by fostering collaboration between investment projects and the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: GMS vision of being a leading supplier of safe \nand climate-friendly agri-food products realized (footnotes 1 and 12). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: GMS investments in and capacity for climate-friendly, safe, and sustainable \nagri-food value chains increased.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  The TA will take a holistic approach and enhance ADB\u2019s value addition by promoting high-\nlevel technology, novel knowledge products, and integrated solutions. It will (i) target government \nofficials, farmers, and agribusinesses; and (ii) develop enabling policies to support private sector \ninvestments and select the best available technology for demonstration. By assessing how each \nGMS country responds to challenges, the TA will deliver three outputs, drawing on lessons and \ngood practices from other countries and minimizing risks encountered in past and current efforts.15 \n \n14.  Output 1: Climate-friendly, inclusive, and gender-responsive agri-food value chains \nand agribusinesses strengthened. This output will build the capacity for implementing climate-\nsmart  agriculture,  demonstrating  innovative  technology,  and  helping  mobilize  agribusiness \nfinancing. The sub-output of promoting green, inclusive, and gender-responsive agri-food value \nchains  will  (i) identify  policies  and  measures  to  promote  clean  energy  and  reduce  water \nconsumption, food losses, and waste in some agri-food value chains, while effectively integrating \ngender concerns; (ii) strengthen the technical and institutional capacity of smallholders and \nagribusinesses along the value chain, particularly women farmers and entrepreneurs, for climate-\nsmart  agriculture, green  supply  chain  management,  agribusiness  skills,  and  value  addition \nthrough public\u2013private partnerships; and (iii) conduct studies on green supply chain management \n(e.g., nitrogen use efficiency, green water management, and renewable and bioenergy for post-\nharvest operations) in key agri-food value chains. The sub-output of facilitating climate-smart \nagribusiness financing will (i) propose measures to improve the financial preparedness of small \nand medium-sized agribusinesses, focusing on creating jobs for women; (ii) build technical and \ninstitutional  capacity  for  green  financing  options  for  agribusinesses;  and  (iii)  conduct \ndemonstrations to guide agribusinesses in adopting low-carbon manufacturing practices. The TA \nwill  organize  fairs  to  introduce  GMS  agribusinesses  to  investors  and  facilitate  knowledge \nexchange among participating agribusinesses. \n \n                                                \n14 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15 Since short-term investment priorities tend to override long-term agricultural sustainability concerns, the TA will \ninvolve and extend assistance to planning and finance ministries, in addition to agriculture ministries. As government \ninterest in borrowing to tackle food safety and quality issues is limited in the GMS, the TA will collaborate with the \nprivate sector to increase its awareness of safety and quality risks to long-term sustainability because of the changing \nclimate. In view of declining overseas development assistance for environmental issues in the GMS, especially by \ndevelopment partners that were involved in previous phases, the TA will mobilize resources from a broader network \nof potential funding sources, including ADB\u2019s own trust funds. Building the capacity of the GMS countries for the \neffective use of food safety and quality assessment tools is a long-term process that would require considerable \nadditional resources and commitment by national development agencies. Knowledge sharing and capacity building \nwill continue, but efforts need to also focus on field demonstrations to strengthen technical and institutional capacity \nand to assess options to create an enabling policy environment to mobilize and de-risk private sector investments. \n ", "5 \n15.  Output 2: Harmonized crop and livestock safety and quality systems adopted. Key \nactivities relating to food safety and quality standards, certification, and traceability include \nsupport for (i) harmonizing GMS policies and standards on food safety and quality assurance, \ncertification  (e.g.,  organic,  good  agricultural  practices,  good  manufacturing  practices,  and \ngeographic indications), accreditation, surveillance, and laboratories; (ii) setting up a platform to \naid  information  exchange,  coordination,  and  food  risk  communication  strategies;  and \n(iii) demonstrating the use of digital technology (e.g., artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things,16 \nand blockchain) for food traceability and quality assurance to promote domestic and regional \ntrade, and ensure compliance with international food safety systems. Activities to improve cross-\nborder animal health and value chains include (i) enhancing policies and legislation on livestock, \nlivestock products, and feed control; (ii) strengthening capacity for animal health workers to \nimprove service delivery, control transboundary animal diseases, zoonoses, and antimicrobial \nresistance; and (iii) demonstrating the use of digital technology for livestock identification and \ntraceability to ensure compliance with international safety and quality assurance systems. The TA \nwill promote close synergies in activity planning with proposed investment to improve GMS cross-\nborder livestock health and value chains in Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nand Myanmar. Collaboration between the GMS countries and the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations Food Safety network will be strengthened. \n \n16.  Output 3: Climate-adaptive agriculture in the context of the water\u2013energy\u2013food \nsecurity nexus enhanced. Key activities include (i) preparing subregional assessments to \nprioritize activities critical to producing more food per drop of water; (ii) training government staff \non climate-resilient soil and water management options, and water accounting in climate change \nscenarios; and (iii) conducting studies on climate-adaptive water management. Activities relating \nto the water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus include (i) establishing a GMS platform to (a) conduct \npolicy dialogues on options to reduce water, energy, carbon, and environmental footprints of \nagricultural practices; (b) align sector policies; and (c) identify low-cost options to make agri-food \nsystems resilient to climate change; (ii) integrating nexus thinking in the climate change action \nplans of agriculture and related ministries, and in project design; and (iii) conducting studies on \nagricultural adaptation that proactively consider the water\u2013energy\u2013food security nexus (e.g., solar \nirrigation and agricultural waste to energy for food processing). \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $3.75 million, of which (i) $3.00 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); and (ii) $0.75 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Climate Change Fund.17 The six GMS governments will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \nBased on TA progress and needs, additional funds may be provided annually or in alternate years, \nincluding from cofinancing sources and ADB-administered trust funds. The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n16 The Internet of Things is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, \nanimals or people that are provided with unique identifiers and the ability to transfer data over a network without \nrequiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. \n17 Established by ADB. \n ", "6 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will administer the TA.18 The Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture \nDivision  of  ADB\u2019s  Southeast  Asia  Department  will  lead  the  overall  TA  implementation  in \ncollaboration with the WGA and its national support units, as well as the GMS Secretariat. National \nstaff from the resident missions will be closely involved in the implementation and invited to some \nWGA meetings. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; and provide staff to act as \nresource persons in the workshops. The WGA focal points will oversee the work of consultants in \ndemonstrating small-scale climate-smart agriculture interventions and technology. All activities \nwill be screened to ensure minimal or no adverse social or environmental impacts as per the ADB \nSafeguards Policy Statement (2009). Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, \nas amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions or staff \ninstructions. Procured goods and assets will be turned over or disposed following ADB processes. \n \n19.  Knowledge products, including gender-specific reports, targeted at government officials, \nresearchers, and development partners will be prepared for the WGA annual meetings and the \nagriculture ministers\u2019 meetings. A limited number of copies of selected reports will be printed in \nEnglish, if demanded, and in the local language, as needed. The developed knowledge reports \nwill include an understanding of the differential needs, opportunities, and experiences of male and \nfemale and/or micro and small-scale farmers. Agriculture information portals will be developed as \npart of the GMS Secretariat\u2019s website.19 Online communities on social media platforms will be \ncreated and will be deactivated within 3 months of the TA completion date.
