THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to Solomon Islands for the Economic and Financial Reform Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed program is a single-tranche policy-based grant of $5 million. The program \ncontinues to support efforts by the Government of Solomon Islands to reform public sector \nmanagement  in  coordination  with  other  development  partners.  It  aims  to  strengthen  the \ngovernment\u2019s implementation of policy reforms that ensure the adequate delivery of public \ninvestment and services. \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Solomon Islands is a small, fragile, post-conflict island state and the poorest in the \nPacific in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.2 The severity of its problems was \nmade evident by the outbreak of civil unrest known as the ethnic tensions in 1999\u20132003 that \ncaused hundreds of deaths and displaced over 20,000 people. Much of the income growth \nachieved after independence in 1978 was lost. The arrival of the Regional Assistance Mission to \nSolomon Islands (RAMSI) quickly restored civil order, which has generally been maintained.3 A \nsurge in foreign aid under the umbrella of RAMSI funded large increases in development budget \nspending that lifted total government expenditure. This initiated a post-conflict recovery. GDP \ngrowth averaged 7.7% per annum in 2004\u20132008.  \n \n4.  The  Solomon  Islands  is  among  the  Pacific  economies most  affected by  the global \neconomic crisis. In 2009, the GDP contracted by 4.7%. In response, the government and \ndevelopment partners formed the core economic working group (CEWG) in March 2009 to \nbetter  meet  the  economic  and  fiscal  challenges  facing  the  country  during  the  crisis.  The \npartnership has developed a comprehensive economic and financial reform program to stabilize \nthe country\u2019s fiscal position, strengthen public finance management, promote priority structural \nreforms, and prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable members of the community.4 In 2010, \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a policy-based grant for the Economic Recovery \nSupport  Program  (ERSP)  to  help  the  government  respond  to  the  crisis  using  the  CEWG \nmechanism of joint coordination between the government and development partners.5 ERSP \nsuccessfully helped the country achieve economic recovery. At the start of ERSP, it was feared \nthat  the  economy  could  stagnate  or  continue  to  decline  in  2010.  However,  the  economy \nrecovered strongly, with real GDP growth of 7.8% in 2010, 10.7% in 2011, and 5.5% in 2012. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  World Development Indicators, current price 2010, purchasing power parity. Comparator countries include the \nFederated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Republic of Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Timor-\nLeste, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \n3  RAMSI is a partnership of the government and people of Solomon Islands and 15 contributing countries in the \nPacific region. It is a long-term initiative to help create the conditions necessary for a return to stability, peace, and \na growing economy. RAMSI was deployed on 24 July 2003, with a mandate unanimously approved by the \nSolomon Islands National Parliament, to help the government restore law and order, strengthen government \ninstitutions, reduce corruption, and reinvigorate the economy. http://www.ramsi.org/ \n4  Details on the government\u2019s program and the linkage of the proposed Economic and Financial Reform Program to \nit are included in the development policy letter; policy matrix; linked documents on sector assessment and \ndevelopment coordination; and supplementary documents on economic analysis and the policy matrix of the \ngovernment\u2019s program. \n5  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Program Cluster \nand Grant for Subprogram 1 to Solomon Islands for the Economic Recovery Support Program. Manila. ", "2 \nFiscal surpluses were achieved in 2010 and 2011, and expenditures on basic social services \nwere protected while the affordability of basic education was improved. \n \n5.  CEWG development partners have provided technical and financial support, effectively \ncontributing  to  reform  progress  together  with  ongoing  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nprograms since 2010. The government and its partners have followed best practices, including \nconnecting individual development partner programs to a unified policy matrix for economic and \nfinancial reforms and consenting to policy actions. RAMSI has provided technical assistance \n(TA) to implement the Financial Economic Management Strengthening Program from late 2010 \nthrough 2013 and has funded resident advisors in key government agencies, especially the \nMinistry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The IMF and the Australian Department of Finance \nand Deregulation have provided assistance in drafting fiscal responsibility legislation. The IMF \nwill  assist  in  revising  National  Provident  Fund  legislation.  The  World  Bank  has  supported \nimproving  governance  in  the  mining  sector  and  strengthening  analysis  of  line  ministry \nexpenditures. ADB has supported the drafting and review of a new customs and excise act, \nstate-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, the reform of secured-transaction and business laws, and \nthe development and implementation of the National Development Strategy (NDS), 2011\u20132020. \nAustralia and New Zealand supported the analysis of strategies and reforms in health and \neducation. The European Union supported public expenditure and financial assessments and \nthe implementation of the NDS. \n \n6.  Despite  the  successful  recovery  and  improved  fiscal  performance  after  the  global \neconomic  crisis,  political  instability  and  poor  government  accountability  and  transparency \nremain,  reflecting  a  weak  institutional  environment.6 These  weaknesses  have  undermined \ngovernment  effectiveness,  which  has  slowed  economic  growth  and  continues  to  restrain \neconomic prospects. Solomon Islands is likely to remain a weak performer (i.e., a fragile state) \nuntil  such  shortcomings  are  firmly  addressed.  In  addition,  the  post-conflict  economy  has \nbecome dependent on high levels of development assistance and unsustainably high rates of \nlogging. Diversifying economic activity is essential if growth is to be sustained.  \n \n7.  Economic growth prospects rest on the private sector and on developments in mining, \nagriculture, fisheries, and tourism. The strongest immediate prospects for job creation and \nhigher government revenue are in fishing, cocoa, copra, palm oil, fruits and vegetables, and \ntourism.  \n \n8.  The  program  will  support  Solomon  Islands\u2019  transition  from  post-conflict  recovery  to \nsustainable  development  based  on  the  NDS,  2011\u20132020.  The  NDS  is  the  first  long-term \ndevelopment strategy since the outbreak of ethnic tensions in 1999. The reforms under the \nprogram align with the government\u2019s economic and financial reform program coordinated by \nCEWG.  \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Solomon Islands proposes continuous and long-\nterm engagement in selected areas. After the completion of its crisis-response program, ADB \ncontinued to provide policy advice and TA and to monitor reform progress. Lessons from the \nERSP have been incorporated in the design of the program.7 For example, the overall design \n                                                \n6  The 2006 riots demonstrated the potential consequences of the unstable political environment. During the riots, \nParliament House was surrounded by protesters and many premises linked to Asian business interests were \ndamaged or destroyed. The riots were incited by politicians who did not support the choice of Prime Minister \nfollowing the general elections held that month. The nominated Prime Minister resigned when it became clear he \nwould lose a vote of no confidence, just as his successor did in December 2007. \n7  ADB. 2012. Completion Report: Economic Recovery Support Program in Solomon Islands. Manila.  \n ", "3 \ncontributed to promoting country ownership through the following qualities: (i) relatively simple \nscope with realistic and achievable goals, (ii) long-term perspective and commitment, and (iii) \nstrong development partner collaboration. Other lessons include (i) using development partners\u2019 \ncoordinated technical and capacity support to the government; (ii) jointly tracking reforms with \ndevelopment partners; (iii) using full-time development coordinators on the ground for policy \ndialogue; and (iv) fostering complementarity. In addition to policy actions for completion prior to \nprogram  approval,  the  policy  matrix  includes  a  set  of  actions  comprising  the  partnership \nmonitoring framework, which aligns with the government\u2019s medium-term reform agenda and is \nto be jointly monitored with CEWG members through 2013.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  impact  will  be  the  government\u2019s  delivery  of  improved  public  investment  and \nservices.  The  outcome  will  be  its  maintaining  a  strong  fiscal  position  while  delivering \nexpanded  and more  equitable  social  services. The impact and outcome  will  be  achieved \nthrough reforms in three areas, toward better public finance management, greater economic \nefficiency for a business-enabling environment, and broader access to social services.  \n \nC.  Outputs  \n \n11.  The government's reform agenda is set out in its policy matrix presented to the CEWG. \nIts comprehensive policy matrix contains 77 policy actions, most of them already achieved and \nthe rest to be accomplished by the end of June 2013. ADB\u2019s program includes 13 policy actions \nthat link to reforms undertaken previously in ADB\u2019s ERSP (footnote 5). All the 13 policy actions \nhave been met. In addition, 13 more actions have been included in the program partnership \nmonitoring framework to facilitate continued policy dialogue and reform momentum (Appendix \n4). ADB supported these reforms through a number of TA projects.8  \n \n1.  Output 1: Better Public Finance Management \n \n12.  The  first  output  is  directed  at  achieving  the  medium-term  goals  of  overall  fiscal \ndiscipline and improved community participation in the budget process. This will ensure that \neffective expenditure controls improve the efficiency, transparency, and equity of the revenue \nsystem  and  the  allocation  of  public  resources  through  stronger  budgeting  and  planning \nprocesses.9  \n \n13.  Improving community awareness of, and input into, the budgetary process. Action \n1.1 required the government to consult civil society organizations, including women\u2019s groups, \nduring the preparation of the 2013 budget. The government\u2019s broader reform agenda is to \nprovide services that meet the needs and aspirations of the people of Solomon Islands. The \nlack of community awareness of, and input to, the budget process has hindered service delivery \nand governance practice. The government therefore initiated, through MOFT\u2019s budget unit, the \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2008.

To prepare the 2013 \nbudget, consultations were conducted from May to June 2012 in almost all provinces. The views \nof  provincial  governments,  civil  society  organizations,  and  churches  were  solicited  on  the \ndelivery of social services, particularly for health and education. The focus was on accessibility, \nquality, and gaps in the existing health and education services. A consultation report was \nreleased among 2013 budget papers.10  \n \n14.  Strengthening  budgeting  and  planning  processes.  A  recognized  weakness  of \ndevelopment plans prior to the NDS is the lack of an effective monitoring and evaluation (M&E) \nframework. Action 1.2 called for formulating and adopting an M&E framework for the NDS by \ndeveloping results-oriented M&E capacity in the Ministry of Development Planning and Aid \nCoordination. An M&E unit was established in August 2012. The government will develop and \nestablish a results-oriented assessment and reporting framework that will monitor progress \nagainst key dimensions of the NDS. This framework will track selected indicators for which data \nare cost-effectively available. The framework was approved by the NDS task force in October \n2012 and endorsed by the cabinet in December 2012. \n \n15.  Ensuring effective expenditure controls. Action 1.3 required that MOFT develop a \nprocurement  manual,  standard  bidding  documents,  and  standard  procurement  contracts. \nImproved  procurement  practices  will  constrain  the  corruption  and  leakage  that  undermine \nservice delivery, allocation efficiency, and fiscal discipline. Procurement compliance has been \nstrengthened with the adoption of a procurement reform plan in July 2012 and the staffing of a \ndedicated procurement unit in MOFT in October 2012. To further improve the operation of the \nunit, the government  has  developed  and  will  adopt  by  April  2013  a procurement  manual, \nstandard bidding documents, and standard procurement contracts. \n \n16.  Improving  customs  administration  and  revenue  collection.  Action  1.4  required \napproval of the release of a draft customs and excise bill for public consultation. This policy \naction is critical, as the current Customs and Excise Act, 1964 is not up to date or conducive to \nefficient  customs  and  excise  tax  collection.  Solomon  Islands  does  not  have  a  substantial \npersonal  income  or  corporate  tax  base.  Customs  and  excise  duties  provide  one-third  of \ngovernment revenue. An appropriate customs and excise tax base is critical to improving the \ngovernment\u2019s  ability  to  function.  A  new  customs  and  excise  bill  has  been  prepared  with \nmeasures to reduce discretionary exemptions to customs duty and excise and sales taxes. The \nnew legislation will also improve duty collection and customs enforcement. Under the program, \nthe government approved the release of a draft customs and excise bill for public consultation in \nFebruary 2013. \n \n17.  Achieving overall fiscal discipline. Action 1.5 called on the government to adopt a \nnew debt management strategy. This reform action evolved from the requirement that there be \nno public borrowing until the 2005 Honiara Club Agreement was reviewed.11 The strategy was \nendorsed by the cabinet in May 2012 and by representatives of the Honiara Club in July 2012. It \nhas been incorporated into the amended Honiara Club Agreement. It specifies guidelines for all \naspects of debt management and stipulates mechanisms for exercising prudence in borrowing \n                                                \n10 Government of Solomon Islands. 2012. Solomon Islands Budget 2013: Budget Strategy and Outlook. Budget \nPaper: Volume 1. Honiara.  \n11 The formal title of the agreement is Minutes on Restructuring the External Debt of Solomon Islands, which was \nsigned in Honiara, Solomon Islands, on 20 October 2005 by the delegations representing Solomon Islands, \nAustralia, the European Commission, the European Investment Bank, and the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment. The agreement is a key instrument for guiding the government\u2019s achievement of overall fiscal \nconsolidation to solve the public debt and arrears problem started in the early 2000s. \n ", "5 \nand the utilization of public debts. Together with the government\u2019s significantly improved debt \nposition, the strategy will greatly enhance the government\u2019s capacity to fund the infrastructure \nnecessary for improved service delivery using concessional finance from international financial \ninstitutions and commercial finance for SOEs. Under the program, MOFT established a debt \nmanagement  advisory  committee  to  advise  the  Minister  of  Finance  and  Treasury  on  new \nborrowing  proposals  in  accordance  with  the  guidelines  laid  down  under  the  strategy.  The \ngovernment has set an annual threshold for public borrowing of SI$150 million for 2012 and \nSI$160 million for 2013 that incorporates contingent liabilities from SOEs. \n \n2.  Output 2: Greater Economic Efficiency for Business Enabling Environment \n \n18.  The second output, the enhanced economic efficiency of SOEs and the private sector, \nwill create an enabling environment for the private sector and enhance corporate governance \nin SOEs and transparency in the resources sector.  \n \n19.  Creating an enabling environment for the private sector. Action 2.1 required the \nadoption of administrative and legislative reforms to facilitate improved processes for women \nand men when registering formal businesses. This forms part of the government\u2019s continued \nefforts to implement a number of reforms to create an enabling environment for the private \nsector. This will reduce the cost of doing business and ensure a level playing field for all \nbusinesses. Company details captured on a newly operationalized electronic companies registry \nare readily accessible to the public as a rich store of useful data, including for lenders. However, \nthe  administration  of business  name  licensing,  which  has  over  800 registrations  per  year, \nprimarily  from  small  trading  businesses,  remains  entirely  paper-based  and  inefficient. The \nunderlying legislation is out of date, and office processes are slow and prone to error. Current \nlegislation  on  business  names  includes  outdated  and  cumbersome  processes  and  gender \ndistortions, requiring a married woman to include her husband\u2019s name on the application form. \nUnder the program, the government  has committed to  adopt legislative and administrative \nreforms,  including  the  provision  of  an  electronic  registry  similar  to  that  under  the  recent \ncompany  reforms,  to  further  improve  processes  for  women  and  men  when  registering \nbusinesses.  \n \n20.  Enhanced corporate governance of state owned enterprises. Action 2.2 required \nthe government to settle arrears owed by the Solomon Islands Water Authority (SIWA) to \nSolomon  Islands  Electricity  Authority  (SIEA).  These  SOEs  signed  a  final  debt  settlement \nagreement on 31 May 2012 that includes provisions for (i) a capital injection into SIWA to be \npaid directly to SIEA; (ii) a long-term, interest-free loan from SIEA to SIWA; and (iii) a write-off of \nSI$9  million  of  the  cross  debt.  The  program  provides  for  further  actions  to  improve  the \nsustainability of both organizations through the scheduled increase of water tariffs coupled with \nimproved water quality and service delivery. Under the program, community service obligation \n(CSO) agreements were obtained for SIWA and SIEA.  \n \n21.  The large amounts of scarce capital absorbed by Solomon Islands SOEs provide very \nlow returns, divert government resources away from vital social investments in health and \neducation, and drive up the cost of doing business where the SOEs are sole service providers. \nCSOs are defined in the SOE Act, 2007 as \u201ca good or service provided by an SOE to a \nconsumer or user on terms that are not expected to generate a normal return to the SOE.\u201d12 The \nregulations of the SOE Act require that SOEs agree on a cost of CSO delivery with their \naccountable minister as compensation for the CSO. Without CSO agreements, SOEs cannot \n                                                \n12 Government of Solomon Islands. 2007. State Owned Enterprise Act, Section 2. Honiara.  \n ", "6 \nset and meet performance targets and the government cannot make informed policy decisions \nrelated to CSO assignments, the quality and efficiency of CSO delivery, and SOE performance. \nWith continued support from ADB, the accounting and financial reporting systems of SOEs are \nbeing upgraded, which will facilitate the implementation of the CSO regulations.13 \n \n22.  Action 2.3 under the program will enhance SOEs\u2019 corporate planning processes by \nsupporting  the  preparation  of  statements  of  corporate  objectives  for  all  eight  SOEs,  in \ncompliance with the SOE Act. The Act requires that an SOE annually prepare its statement as a \nrolling 3-year document specifying business purpose, mission statement, corporative objectives \nand values, nature and scope of activities, regulatory framework, and strategic directions, for \nsubmission to the accountable minister. All SOEs have prepared and submitted their statements \nfor 2013. In addition to implementing the SOE policy reforms, the government has collaborated, \nthrough MOFT\u2019s Economic Reform Unit as its focal point, with the Solomon Islands Chamber of \nCommerce  to  implement  a  corporate  governance  services  initiative  to  expand  the  pool  of \nwomen qualified to serve on SOE boards. It involves director training programs and a database \nof potential directors.  \n \n23.  Enhanced transparency in the resources sector. Under Action 2.4, the government \nhas  applied  as  a  candidate  to  the  Extractive  Industries  Transparency  Initiative  (EITI) \ninternational secretariat by forming a multi-stakeholder group and finalizing an EITI work plan in \nconsultation  with  stakeholders.  The  reopening  of  the  Gold  Ridge  mine  and  the  possible \ndevelopment of nickel deposits has potential to raise community tensions, which could disrupt \nsector  development.  There  will  be  a  need  to  work  with  the  mining  companies  and  local \ncommunities to devise mechanisms to make the reporting of mining revenues more transparent, \nespecially regarding arrangements for revenue sharing with local communities. This will be \nfacilitated by government participation in the EITI.  \n \n3.  Output 3: Broader Access to Social Services \n \n24.  Increased  budget  allocation  to  health  and  education.  Budget  support  provided \nunder the program will enable increased government expenditure for the social services that \nmatter most to the poor, the vulnerable, and women. Actions 3.1 and 3.2 required increased \nbudget  allocation  for  education  and  health.  The  government  has  allocated  23.7%  of \nconsolidated expenditure in the 2013 budget for delivering education services, and 16.0% for \nhealth services, raising overall social expenditure from 34.0% in 2012 to 39.7% in 2013.  \n \n25.  Gender equity in education. The government has adopted a number of policy plans \nand  processes  to  improve  equitable  access  to  social  services.  Action  3.3  called  on  the \ngovernment to adopt the medium-term National Education Action Plan (NEAP), 2013\u20132015, \nwhich includes result-based targets to make access to education services more equitable and a \nparticipatory assessment of the implementation of the previous NEAP, 2010\u20132012. The new \nNEAP builds on earlier progress by expanding access to early childhood education, secondary \neducation,  and  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training.  Particular  emphasis  is  on \nimproving access for girls to senior secondary, technical, and vocational education and training, \nas well as to tertiary education. The new NEAP includes targets that promote gender equity, \nincluding  measures  to  promote  the  enrollment  of  girls  in  secondary  school  and  technical \ncolleges. \n \n26.  Gender  mainstreaming  of  health  policies.  Under  Action  3.4,  the  government \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative, Phase 2. Manila. \n ", "7 \nestablished and operationalized a task force for mainstreaming gender in health policies, which \nreports to the national steering committee on gender equality and women\u2019s development. The \nnational  health  task  force,  comprising  permanent  secretaries  and  key  stakeholders,  was \nestablished  to oversee gender-mainstreaming activities in the health sector, and held its first \nmeeting in September 2012. The task force monitors the implementation of the Gender Equality \nand Women\u2019s Development Policy and reports to Parliament annually through the Ministry of \nWomen, Youth, Children, and Family Affairs. In November 2012, a gender focal point in the \nMinistry of Health and Medical Services was added to serve the task force. The task force is \nresponsible for (i) coordinating the gathering of sex-disaggregated data and gender analysis \nfrom government ministries and stakeholders, (ii) building the capacity of human resources to \nensure that plans and budgets are gender sensitive, and (iii) undertaking gender auditing and \nstocktaking of health sector policies.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n27.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFund  resources  to  help  finance  the  program.14 The  grant  size  was  determined  with  due \nconsideration of (i) the relative importance of public sector management reform for ensuring \nsustained  economic  growth,  (ii)  the  development  financing  needs  of  the  country,  (iii)  the \navailability of additional financing from other development partners, and (iv) the significance and \ncomplexity of the policy actions of the program. The grant proceeds of $5 million (equivalent to \n0.5% of GDP), together with contributions from other development partners, will substantially \ncontribute to closing the $9 million recurrent financing gap in the 2013 budget. This allows the \nachievement of a small budget surplus to rebuild the fiscal buffer of at least 2 months of \nrecurrent  spending  after  the  cash  reserves  were  depleted  in  2012.  The  rebuilding  and \nmaintenance of this buffer is important given the volatile nature of domestic revenues, as well as \na key target and recommendation of the IMF program for the country.15 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The program period is from 1 April 2012 to 31 December 2013. Program funding will be \nprovided as a single tranche grant of $5 million to be disbursed when the government has met \nthe conditions for effectiveness, including completing the agreed prior policy actions as set forth \nin the policy matrix. Grant proceeds will be disbursed to Solomon Islands using ADB\u2019s simplified \ndisbursement procedures and related requirements for program loans.16 The program will not \nfinance the engagement of consultants. The government and ADB will continuously review \nprogram implementation using the design and monitoring framework and the policy matrix. \nProceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nexcluding  items  on  the  list  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \nmultilateral sources.17 Grant proceeds disbursed to finance imports will require a certificate from \nthe government stipulating that the value of total imports to Solomon Islands, minus its imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is greater than the amount of the grant to be disbursed during a \n                                                \n14 The country's eligibility for ADB\u2019s Special Fund resources under the revised grant framework is determined by its \nrisk of debt distress. The latest debt sustainability analysis in the International Monetary Fund's 2009 Article IV \nConsultation determined that Solomon Islands had a moderate risk of debt distress and was therefore eligible to \nreceive 50% of its Asian Development Fund allocation as grants. \n15 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n16 ADB. 1998.

Local currency generated from the proceeds of the grants will be used to \nsupport public expenditure objectives under the program. \n \n29.  MOFT will be the executing and implementing agency. The CEWG mechanism and the \ngovernment\u2019s  own  processes  will  be  used  to  monitor  outcomes  and  impacts.  MOFT  is \nresponsible  for  overall  program  implementation,  including  implementing  all  policy  actions, \nadministering the program, disbursing funds, and maintaining all program records. MOFT will \nmonitor and report to ADB on the implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget \noutcomes in line with the design and monitoring framework. Monitoring outcomes and impacts \nwill maximize the use of the government\u2019s own processes and the CEWG mechanism. \n \n30.  In cooperation with MOFT and CEWG, ADB will carry out periodic reviews, continuing \nthe well-functioning practice under the ERSP (footnote 5).18 The government will continue to \nkeep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies that have implications for program implementation, as well as provide ADB with the \nopportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The  reviews  will  evaluate  the \nimplementation of the policy reform and assess impact, describe lessons identified during the \nprogram period, and outline policy actions and any assistance needed to accomplish the agreed \nreform targets. Program design draws on dialogue with stakeholders in the private sector and \ncivil society such as the Solomon Islands Chamber of Commerce, Solomon Islands Women in \nBusiness  Association,  and  Development  Services  Exchange  (an  umbrella  organization  for \nnongovernment organizations in Solomon Islands). \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial  \n31.  Against the backdrop of a deteriorating macroeconomic position and lower revenue \ncollection, the major constraint is the lack of public funds to finance social service delivery. \nGrant proceeds will cover short-term adjustment costs that will allow the government to maintain \nreasonable shares in the national budget to be allocated for social services. The reform program \naims to ensure sustainable and inclusive economic growth with measures that usher the country \nthrough the transition to a strong public finance management system, and ensure domestic \ncapacity for public administration and security, as RAMSI is being phased out.19  \n \n32.  The program will improve government accountability and transparency by facilitating \nmore  civil  society  participation  in  the  budget  process,  improving  procurement  processes, \nformulating a new debt strategy, and creating an M&E framework for the NDS. It will improve \nthe SOE corporate governance and performance, which currently drag on economic growth. \nMore generally, broader social service delivery will improve health and education outcomes, \nfurther enabling Solomon Islanders to generating income locally and abroad. \n \nB.  Governance \n33.  Public  finance  management.  Due  diligence  on  various  aspects  of  public  finance \n                                                \n18 Detailed actions taken by MOFT and the joint annual review of the ERSP and the government\u2019s comprehensive \nprogram are described in section 3 of the Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 The program\u2019s contribution to poverty reduction and the ADB results framework are in Contribution to the ADB \nResults Framework and Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nmanagement  reforms  (taxation,  public  expenditure,  budget,  and  planning)  continues  to  be \ncoordinated  under  individual  CEWG  partners,  government  agencies,  and  the  IMF.  ADB \nregularly participates along with the government and CEWG partners in the annual review of the \ngovernment\u2019s progress in implementing its reform agenda since 2010. ADB, Australia,  the \nEuropean  Union,  the  World  Bank,  and  government  representatives  carried  out  joint  due \ndiligence related to public finance management and reforms under the government\u2019s program \nfrom  July  to  October  2012.20 Subsequently,  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  shared  their  own \nassessments  of  the  progress  of  target  reform  actions  under  their  respective  policy-based \nprograms that support the reforms under the 2013 national budget. Several of the policy actions \nunder the two programs are identical, as they are part of the government\u2019s reform agenda.21 \n \n34.  Anticorruption measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the government and MOFT. The specific policy requirements \nand supplementary measures are described in the legal documents.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n35.  The program will contribute to poverty reduction by helping to protect the delivery of \nbasic  services  to  the  vulnerable.  The  program  will  foster  poverty  reduction  and  social \ndevelopment through (i) sustained, equitable, and inclusive economic growth over the long term; \n(ii) improved public finance management and creating a more enabling business environment; \n(iii) stronger delivery of health and education services; and (iv) greater job creation as the \nprivate sector grows.  \n \n36.  The program is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. It will promote women\u2019s \nparticipation in decision making by requiring that women\u2019s groups be consulted as part of the \nannual budget process. It will improve women\u2019s access to productive resources by reviewing the \nprocess and laws regarding the administration of business names. The program will improve \nwomen\u2019s access to education through the adoption of a new education strategy that includes \noutputs to  improve  access to secondary  education, the  principal  area  of  women\u2019s  relative \ndisadvantage in education. The program is designed to give women greater access to better-\nquality health care through work carried out under the gender mainstreaming task force chaired \nby the permanent secretary of health and medical services, which was established in late 2011 \nand put into operation in 2012.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n37.  The program is safeguard category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous  peoples.  No  adverse  environmental  impacts  were  identified.  No  involuntary \nresettlement  or  impacts  on  indigenous  people  are  expected.  During  fact  finding,  a  public \nconsultation with representatives from civil society organizations discussed the program\u2019s social \nimpact  and  contribution  to  poverty  reduction,  in  addition  to  the  government\u2019s  consultation \nprograms related to reforms during the preparation of the NDS, 2011\u20132020 (in the first half of \n2011) and the 2013 national budget (May\u2013June 2012).  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 1 and described in detail \n                                                \n20 The Solomon Island Core Economic Working Group. 2012.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n39.  The government and MOFT have assured ADB that implementation of the program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant documents. \n \n40.  The  government  and  MOFT  have  agreed  with  ADB  on  certain  covenants  for  the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement: (i) the government will (a) maintain the \npolicies adopted and actions taken under the program prior to the date of the grant agreement, \nas described in the development policy letter and the policy matrix, for the duration of the \nprogram and subsequently; (b) promptly adopt the other policies and the other actions as \nspecified in the development policy letter and the policy matrix; and (c) ensure that such policies \nand  actions  continue  in  effect  for  the  duration  of  the  program;  and  subsequently  (ii)  the \ngovernment  and  the  program  implementing  agencies  will  ensure  that,  throughout  program \nimplementation,  adequate  budgetary  allocations  of  required  counterpart  funds  are  made, \napproved, and released on time to ensure proper program implementation. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve the grant of \n$5,000,000 to Solomon Islands for the Economic and Financial Reform Program, from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial  Funds  resources;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the Board. \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n27 February 2013 \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources \nPerformance Targets and  and Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nThe Government of  The relative living standard of  Household  There are no major natural \nSolomon Islands  the most vulnerable people  income and  disasters or other external \ndelivering improved  improves, as measured by a  expenditure  shocks. \npublic investment  rising expenditure share of the  surveys by the \nDomestic political and \nand services  poorest 20% of households.
