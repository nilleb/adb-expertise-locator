Objectives, Major Outputs and Activities  \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will promote the development of \ndistributed  solar  photovoltaic  (PV)  systems  in  Uzbekistan.  Despite  vast  available  potential \nresources,  renewable  projects  are  largely  under-developed.  The  TA  will  (i)  support  the \ndevelopment of government\u2019s sector strategy for distributed solar systems to further improve the \nquality of electricity in remote regions and also to scale up through private investments;1 (ii) install \na 20 kilowatt (kW) distributed solar PV system to demonstrate the technical feasibility and \nsocioeconomic benefits;2 and (iii) strengthen institutional capacity through hands-on training in \nplanning, designing, developing, implementing, and operating the distributed solar PV system. \nExpansion of distributed solar PV systems will help enhance energy access and fulfill the \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to mitigate climate change impacts. \n \n2.  Technical and legal analytical works will be conducted to identify gaps in the policy and \nregulatory frameworks. The TA will provide practical implementation measures for the renewable \nenergy auction mechanism that will allow greater private investors\u2019 participation in small-scale \nrenewable energy projects. Key activities will include (i) analysis of the policy, regulations, \ntechnical barriers for grid interconnection, anticipated grid impact as well as the adequacy of grid \ncode; (ii) review of tariff mechanism and infrastructure for net-metering; (iii) development of \nroadmap and policy paper for the government by consolidating technical, regulatory, financial and \neconomic assessment; (iv) develop renewable energy auction mechanism with related regulatory \nframework, comprehensive manual, platform and sample transaction templates; (v) demonstrate \ndeveloped  renewable  energy  auction  platform;  and  (vi)  conduct  study  tours,  stakeholder \nconsultations and workshops to disseminate the knowledge and international best practices.  \n \n3.  The TA will finance a pilot project to install a 20 kW distributed solar PV system. The \nintegration of battery energy storage system or solar water heater will be considered depending \non the electricity demand profile and local energy needs. Key activities will include: (i) formulation \nof project selection criteria and assessment tools, taking into account of technical, financial, socio-\nenvironment characteristics; (ii) conducting technical and safeguards due diligence on the target \nprojects; (iii) procurement and installation of pilot project; and (iv) training of EA officials for \noperation and maintenance. \n \n4.  The  TA  will  build  the  institutional  capacity  to  plan,  design,  install  and  operate  the \ndistributed solar systems. Capacity building activities will particularly focus on the capacity \ndevelopment of Joint Stock Company Regional Electric Network (JSC REN) as the owner of the \ndistribution networks to review and analysis of the grid impact by the integration of small-scale \ndecentralized  power  generators.  Training  to  JSC  REN  staff  will  be  provided  to  enhance \nunderstanding and expertise in solar PV project design and implementation. 50% of the training \nparticipants will be women. As to the business model development for productive use of electricity, \nwomen-led small businesses will be considered as a priority. \n \n \n1  In the President Resolution No. 4779 (dated 10 July 2020), the government envisioned the implementation of \nrenewable energy resources (except HPP) to be carried out through transparent auction.  \n2  In the President Resolution No. 4422 (dated 22 August 2019), the government envisioned measures on an \nuninterrupted supply of energy resources to the social facilities (such as preschools and healthcare facilities) through \nthe phased installation of modern solar PV plants and solar water heaters.
