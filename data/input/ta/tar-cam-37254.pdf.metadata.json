The Asian Development Bank (ADB) comanaged three joint preparatory missions over \nthe period January to July 2004 with the aim of supporting the Government of Cambodia\u2019s \npublic financial management (PFM) reform program by helping to develop: (i) a prioritized, \nsequenced,  and  Government-owned  strategy  and  action  plan;  (ii)  complementary  capacity \nbuilding,  organizational  change,  and  performance  management  strategies;  and  (iii)  a \ncoordinated external funding agency support mechanism.1   \n \n2.  The missions established that the Government and the aid community agree that a \nsector-wide  approach  should  be  used  to  drive  the  proposed  PFM  reform  program.  The \napproach should maximize Government ownership, enable flexibility in program management to \noptimize program performance, minimize transaction costs, and effectively manage fiduciary \nrisk. The approach should also focus on facilitating achievement of results rather than excessive \ncontrol of inputs. \n \n3.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Finance  (MEF)  Reform  Committee  presented  the \nGovernment\u2019s draft PFM reform program to external funding agencies on 26 July 2004. MEF \nhas requested ADB support for the PFM reform program and Consolidated Action Plan (CAP) in \nthe following areas: (i) strengthening macrofiscal framework management and budget resource \nforecasting (CAP activity 4),2 (ii) redesigning the budget cycle to provide a basis for policy-based \nbudgeting (CAP activity 25), and (iii) integrating functions within MEF to support the redesigned \nbudget cycle (CAP activity 33). The proposed technical assistance (TA) will contribute to the \nvision, objectives, scope, and performance measures described in the PFM reform program and \nCAP document, specifically CAP activities 25 and 33. The TA's goal, purpose, scope, and \noutputs are summarized in the TA framework (Appendix 1).3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The  draft  country  strategy  program  (CSP),  2005\u20132009,  points  out  that  Cambodia's \ngovernance needs are substantial and require prioritization if the country is to move forward. \nPFM has been identified as a key area requiring immediate action. The quality of systems of \nplanning, managing, and accounting for public finance is critical to all government functions, \nincluding the capacity to direct national resources to improving service delivery and reducing \npoverty.  The  budget  structure  is  geared  to  financing  of  institutions  rather  than  services. \nIncreasingly, budget execution has suffered from delays and unpredictable releases of funds, \ncaused by cash constraints, thus undermining operational planning. The system is plagued by \ndeficient  accounting  and  reporting  systems  that  lead  to  a  weak  control  environment  and \nincreasing opportunities for corruption.  \n \n                                               \n1  The joint missions were comanaged by ADB and World Bank (WB), with support and participation by the Australian \nAgency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  Department  for  International  Development  (DFID)  (United \nKingdom),  European  Commission  (EC),  Government  of  France,  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA), Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), and Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF). \n2  ADB support to CAP activity 4 will be provided through ongoing technical assistance (ADB. 2001. Technical \nAssistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Strengthening Public Financial Management. Manila [TA 3634:CAM, \napproved 1 February 2001 for $1.2 million equivalent]). \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 22 June 2004. \n ", " 2  \n5.  The design of the Government\u2019s PFM reform program has been informed by knowledge \ngenerated and lessons learned during the technical cooperation assistance program (TCAP),4 \nthe joint World Bank-ADB Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review,5 \ngovernment task forces, and other external funding agency support programs. The TCAP \nenhanced the understanding of PFM reforms among government and external funding agency \nstakeholders. It also provided MEF with experience in coordinating TA support and activities. It \nproduced  a  number  of  substantive  outputs  and  laid  the  foundation  for  future  assistance. \nHowever,  the  design  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TCAP  did  not  include  all \nstakeholders. Often, TA was focused on a small group of officials and did not fully involve key \ndepartments. The TCAP management and monitoring arrangements focused exclusively on \nthose departments involved in TCAP components. The exclusion of several important functions \nof MEF from the program, combined with the lack of an inclusive top executive management \nmechanism within MEF, contributed to a lack of cohesion in the program activities, and made it \nmore difficult to mainstream reform activities within MEF regular processes.  \n \n6.  Two key lessons from the TCAP experience were highlighted in an ADB midterm review \nreport:6 (i) external funding support should be based on MEF's own vision for the development \nof PFM systems and a process through which reform initiatives are developed and prioritized by \nMEF, endorsed by all development partners, and regularly and jointly reviewed; and (ii) the \nmanagement of the PFM reform process within MEF requires a well-designed, comprehensive, \nand sequenced process of institutional development. \n \n7.  Through  TA  (footnote  2),  ADB  has  supported  budget  formulation  and  strategic \nexpenditure analysis, medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) design, fiscal devolution, \nand  training.  About  80%  of  TA  activities  were  focused  on  training.  Consequently,  limited \nresources were allocated to institutionalizing and strengthening budget and MTEF processes \nwithin MEF. The MTEF needs to be fully integrated into the annual budget cycle, and all key \nstakeholders need to be involved in the budget and MTEF processes.7   \n \n8.  The Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport8 and the Ministry of Health already have \nrelatively strong sectoral planning processes. The MTEF is viewed in these two ministries as a \nrealistic multiyear resource framework against which sectoral activities can be prioritized and \nrealistic  expenditure  plans  developed.  MTEFs  were  introduced  in  the  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment, water, justice, gender, and road maintenance sectors in 2004. In these sectors, \nsectoral planning processes are less advanced and there is less understanding of the potential \nrole and usefulness of the MTEF exercise. In the Ministry of Agriculture, officials have requested \ngreater clarity about the relationship and possible duplication between the MTEF and public \ninvestment program exercises.9  \n \n9.  The Government\u2019s overall vision for PFM is to implement high standards of management \nand accountability in mobilizing all government current and capital resources, and to improve \n                                               \n4  The TCAP was a $6.7-million program financed by ADB, DFID, IMF, Japan, Netherlands, and UNDP, aimed at \nstrengthening  tax  policy  and  administration,  customs  administration,  budget  management,  statistics,  legal \nframework, the banking system, and linkages between economic and financial management for poverty reduction. \n5  WB-ADB. 2003. Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review: Cambodia. Manila. \n6  Midterm Review of ADB TA Support to RGC Development of an MTEF, Draft Final Report, February 2004. \n7  Some of the activities supported under the proposed TA will include those not completed under TA 3634 (footnote \n2), which are included in the Government's new PFM reform program. \n8  Further support to budget planning in the education sector will be provided through ADB's Second Education \nSector Development Program, which is being processed in 2004. \n9  A separate TA to support budget planning of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery, in collaboration with \nADB's Agriculture Sector Development Program, is being processed.   ", "      3\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the use of resources in implementing the National Poverty \nReduction Strategy (NPRS) and other priority programs (see Appendix 2 for an overview of the \nPFM Reform Program). The long-term objective is to transform the Government\u2019s PFM system \ninto a system with features that are generally accepted as the best international standards. The \nGovernment recognizes that achieving that vision is going to be a long-term undertaking. It is \nimportant, therefore, to identify stages in the process at which the Government can assess \nwhether defined intermediate objectives have been reached before proceeding to the next \nstage. Each stage will provide a platform on which further stages can be undertaken. Four \nintermediate objectives, defined as stages culminating in platforms, have been identified as \nfollows: (i) a more credible budget; (ii) effective financial accountability; (iii) a fully affordable and \nprioritized Government policy agenda; and (iv) Government managers held fully accountable for \nprogram performance.10  \n \n10.  Under stage 1, the Government will strive to make the budget more credible as an \ninstrument of strategic and day-to-day management of public resources, transforming it into a \nreliable  and  predictable  tool  for  individual  budget  managers.  The  budget  must  reflect  all \nsignificant public resources and their deployment and at subsequent stages should enable \nbudget managers to be held more accountable for the proper, efficient, and effective use of \nresources.  Organizational  measures  will  be  required  to  clarify  functions  and  to  improve \ncoordination among departments in MEF, and to facilitate the effective deployment of MEF staff \nresources and development partner assistance to implement stage 1 and to achieve platform 1.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The proposed TA will support the Government\u2019s reform efforts for stage 1 and platform 1 \nand preparatory activities for stage 2 and platform 2. The goal of the TA is to assist the \nGovernment to ensure that the budget is comprehensive and policy-based. The goal represents \none of four performance measures related to the overall objective of stage 1 and platform 1, to \nimprove the credibility of the budget. The purpose of the TA is to assist the Government to \nestablish a single and orderly budget process, producing integrated budget plans. To achieve \nthis, the TA will assist the Government to deliver the following outputs: (i) establishment  of \nredesigned budget cycle that provides the basis for policy-based budgeting, (ii) integration of \nfunctions within MEF to support a redesigned budget cycle, and (iii) strengthened capacity of \nGovernment staff to implement the redesigned budget cycle. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA activities will be drawn from the Government\u2019s CAP and will help achieve \nselected outputs and the overall objective of stage 1 and platform 1. MEF recognizes that, in \norder to ensure that the redesigned budget cycle operates effectively, functions within MEF \nrelated to budget management will need to be reviewed, departmental structures reconfigured, \nand  capacity  of  staff  strengthened.  The  TA  will  provide  technical  support  to  define  the \nspecifications of a redesigned budget cycle that will enable programmatic budgeting for the \nfuture. This support will be complemented by organizational analysis and capacity building to \nsupport institutional arrangements that will enable a sustainable redesigned budget cycle.  \n \n                                               \n10 Details of the platform approach and objectives, results, and performance measures for each platform are \ndescribed in the Government\u2019s PFM Reform Program and CAP (draft, 11 August 2004).   \n ", " 4  \n13.   Redesigned Budget Cycle that Provides the Basis for Policy-Based Budgeting \nEstablished. The TA will support MEF's work as defined under CAP activity 25. The TA will \nhelp MEF design and implement a single budget cycle that allocates all resources available for \ngovernment expenditure.  The budget cycle is expected to consider  medium-term  strategic \nbudget planning and annual detailed budget formulation requirements. Special attention will be \ndirected to (i) mainstreaming priority action programs within the redesigned budget cycle; (ii) \nstudying options for strengthening the integration of provincial-level budgeting within the overall \nbudget cycle; (iii) supporting public expenditure tracking surveys and using the findings to inform \ndevelopment of the budget cycle; and (iv) enhancing budget feedback mechanisms, including \npiloting  public  dissemination  of  summary  budget  information.  The  surveys  will  help  the \nGovernment identify budget system problems that impede the efficiency and effectiveness of \nhealth service delivery. \n \n14.   Integration of Functions within MEF to Support the Redesigned Budget Cycle. \nThe TA will support MEF's work as defined under CAP activity 33. MEF recognizes the need to \nbring together work groups that need to work closely together for effective organizational \nchange to achieve stage 1 and platform 1 objectives. Key aims related to CAP activity 25 are to \n(i) strengthen the policy framework for the budget, and (ii) improve integration of the budget \ncycle functions across the core budget system departments. The TA will support MEF in its \norganizational  restructuring  efforts,  including  functional  reviews  of  MEF  departments  with \nbudget management responsibilities, assessments of organizational requirements so that the \nredesigned budget cycle is implemented effectively, and support for capacity-building measures. \nThe TA will also support MEF's efforts to establish mechanisms for internal coordination on \ndecentralization and deconcentration (D&D) budget issues, including establishment of a clear \ninterface with other government agencies involved in D&D.   \n \n15.   Strengthened Capacity of Government Staff to Implement Redesigned Budget \nCycle. The  TA  will  support  capacity  building  of  Government  staff  in  the  following  areas: \n(i) building awareness and understanding  of the objectives of the redesigned budget cycle, \n(ii) training for budget staff in spending agencies on guidelines for budget submissions, and \n(iii) strengthening  sectoral  expertise  in  the  MEF  budget  and  policy  departments.  Particular \nattention will be paid to coordination and collaboration between the TA and ADB support to PFM \nreform efforts through sectoral programs, especially in education and agriculture. This should \nhelp MEF build sectoral expertise within the ministry. Efforts will be made to ensure that new \nskills and knowledge are used effectively by staff members in carrying out their new job \nresponsibilities and duties related to the budget cycle. Training activities will be evaluated and \nthe impact of training on job performance will be monitored.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $706,000 equivalent, comprising $405,000 in \nforeign exchange and $301,000 equivalent in local currency costs. ADB will provide $600,000 \nequivalent  to  finance  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $195,000  equivalent  of  local \ncurrency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The \nGovernment will fund the remaining $106,000 equivalent of local costs. Detailed cost estimates \nand a financing plan for the TA are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n17.  The  proposed  external  funding  agency  coordination  arrangements  under  the  PFM \nsector-wide  approach  are  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  ownership  and  leadership.  This  is ", "      5\nreflected  in  the  partnership  principles,  which  outline  principles  of  engagement  for  the \ndevelopment partners that will be promoted by the Government and the development partners \nsupporting PFM. The MEF Reform Committee has been established to lead the PFM reform \nprogram. It is supported by a secretariat that will assist it to (i) coordinate departmental action \nplans, (ii) liaise with development partners, (iii) liaise with other government agencies, and (iv) \nmonitor the progress and impact of the reform program. The PFM working group will be the \nmain forum for development partners and the Government to convene and discuss strategic \nissues and to review the progress and impact of the reform program. A PFM development \npartner committee will be established under the working group to ensure coordination and \nharmonization among the development partners.  \n \n18.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be MEF. MEF plans to merge the Economic and \nFinance Policy, Planning and Monitoring Unit, and the Economic Analysis and Forecasting \nDepartment into a new Economic and Public Finance Policy Department. This new unit will be \nresponsible for enabling (i) a strengthened policy framework for the budget; and (ii) integration \nof the policy framework with financial forecasting, and statistical reporting and analysis. The new \nunit will be responsible for the \"top-down\" part of the MTEF and strategic budget planning \nprocess. The Budget Department is expected to (i) develop a budget framework and procedural \nguidelines for MEF's budget formulation and execution management; (ii) lead the bottom-up \nMTEF preparation process and annual budget formulation; and (iii) coordinate and direct all \nreforms  of  the  central  budget  system  (budget  cycle  redesign,  budget  classification  reform, \nfinancial D&D initiatives). The TA is expected to engage primarily with the new Economic and \nPublic Finance Policy Department and the Budget Department. \n \n19.  Sixteen  person-months  of  international  consultant  inputs  and  24  person-months  of \ndomestic consultant inputs will be required in strategic budget planning, budget management, \npublic  expenditure  tracking  surveys,  organizational  development,  and  human  resources \ndevelopment.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  4.  The \nconsultants will be engaged by ADB and selected on an individual basis in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Consultants will be required to provide an inception report \n1 month after the start of the assignment, mission reports upon completion of each mission, and \na final report within 1 month of contract completion. Procurement under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement.  \n \n20.  The TA will support the PFM reform program over 24 months, from 1 January 2005 to 31 \nDecember 2006.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \n \nthe Government of Cambodia for Support to Public Financial Management Reform Program, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORKa \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions \n  Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n       \nHelp the Government of  By December 2007:  \u2022  MEF Reform   \nCambodia ensure the  \u2022  Extrabudgetary activities below  Committee annual \nbudget is comprehensive  1% of total government  strategic reviews of \nand policy based   spending (or up to 10%, but  PFM program \n  fully reported)  \u2022  Biannual PFM \n\u2022  All major external funding  working group \nagency-funded spending  (Government and \ncaptured in annual budget  development \ndocumentation  partners) meetings  \n\u2022  Single budget process   \ncoordinating budgeting for   \ninvestment and recurrent   \nexpenditures at central, \nministry and agency levels and \nprogram and functional levels  \n\u2022  Recurrent costs of investments \nbudgeted \n\u2022  Spending ministries have \nreceived clear guidance on \npreparation of budget \nsubmissions \n\u2022  Budget ceilings are informed \nby Government spending \npriorities defined at the political \nlevel  \n\u2022  Ministries adhere to budget \ncalendar \nPurpose      Assumptions \n       \nEstablish a single and  \u2022  Budget cycle in place in 2006  \u2022  Quarterly progress  \u2022  Other ministries \norderly budget process  for 2007 preparation cycle    reports prepared by  involved in the budget \nproducing integrated  \u2022  Budget cycle provides a basis  MEF Reform  process, including the \nbudget plans  for effective policy-based  Committee  Ministry of Planning, \n  budgeting  secretariat  and line ministries will \n  \u2022  TA progress  cooperate with \nreports  streamlining planning \n\u2022  Joint development  processes such as the  \npartner review  public investment \nmissions  program, NPRS, etc. \n\u2022  External funding \nagencies will provide full \ndisclosure of funding for \nGovernment. \n\u2022  Government will take \nmeasures to discourage \noff-budget transactions. \n\u2022  Close coordination \nbetween the MEF \nReform Commttee and \nexternal funding \nagencies participating in \nthe PFM sector-wide \napproach \nContinued on next pag e ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring  Assumptions \n  Mechanisms  and Risks \n   \n \nRisks \n\u2022  Government does not \ncontinue strong support \nfor PFM reform \n\u2022  MEF Reform Committee \ndoes not continue to \ncarry out its \nperformance \nmanagement function \neffectively \n\u2022  Line ministries and/or \nprovinces become \nreluctant to follow MEF \nleadership and \nguidance \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

Overall Vision of Public Financial Management \nThe overall vision is to install much higher standards of management and accountability \nin the mobilization of all Government current and capital resources and to achieve greater \neffectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources in their application to the Government\u2019s \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy and other priority programs. The long-term objective is to \nbase  the  Government's  public  financial  management  (PFM)  system  on  best  international \nstandards. \n \nB.  Long-term sequenced strategy \n \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  reaching  this  vision  is  going  to  be  a  long-term \nundertaking. It is important, therefore, to identify stages in the process of reform at which the \nGovernment will assess whether well-defined intermediate objectives have been reached before \nproceeding to the next stage. Each stage is designed so as to bring about a change in the \noverall performance of the PFM system, and provide the platform on which further stages can \nthen be undertaken. Four platforms have been identified.  \n \n(i)  A more credible budget. In the first instance, the Government will strive to \nmake the budget more credible as an instrument of strategic and day-to-day \nmanagement of public resources that delivers a reliable and predictable resource \nto individual budget managers. This will require that the budget should reflect all \nsignificant public resources and their deployment. It will thereby enable budget \nmanagers to be held more accountable for the proper, efficient and effective use \nof resources at subsequent stages.  \n \n(ii)  Effective financial accountability. Having removed excuses for noncompliance \nor  inappropriate  practices  by  budget  holders,  the  Government  will  focus  on \ntightening arrangements for bringing budget holders to account and for rewarding \ngood  practice.  This  will  require  initial  improvements  in  internal  control  and \naccountability systems at all levels. It will enable a focus on what is done with \nresources  by  providing  better  data,  effective  discipline,  and  greater  internal \ntransparency. \n \n(iii)  The Government's policy agenda becomes fully affordable and prioritized. \nFrom the base established in previous stages, ensuring the budget becomes a \ncredible instrument for policy implementation, the Government will then focus on \ndeveloping  techniques  and  capacities  for  analyzing  the  budgetary  impact  of \npolicies and for connecting policy priorities and service targets to budget planning \nand implementation.  This will ensure that government polices are fully affordable \nand prioritized and enable greater accountability for program performance. \n \n(iv)  Government managers become fully accountable for program performance. \nHaving  reinforced  the  stability,  soundness  and  policy  orientation  of  budget \nplanning and management practices, the Government will start to hold budget \nmanagers accountable and reward them for achieving agreed objectives and \nstandards  of  performance.  Processes  of  accountability  and  review  for  both \nfinancial  and  performance  management  will  be  fully  integrated,  resulting  in \n ", "12  Appendix 2 \ngreater external transparency and more effective feedback from implementation \ninto policy formulation. \n \nC.  Activities in Support of Platform One \n \nThe overall objective of platform 1 is to make the budget more credible.

Development Partner Coordination and Mobilization of Support \n \nThere is broad consensus among both development partners and the Government that a \nsector-wide approach be used to drive the proposed PFM reform program.  This approach \nshould build on achievements of the technical cooperation assistance program and the analysis \nand recommendations of the Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review1 \nand other analytical work, such as the partnership working group studies on aid coordination \nand capacity building practices. The proposed donor coordination arrangement under the PFM \nsector-wide  approach  is  founded  on  the  Government's  ownership  and  leadership. This  is \nreflected in the proposed partnership principles, which outline principles of engagement for the \ndevelopment partners that will be promoted by both the  Government and the  development \npartners.  \n \nA subset of development partners has decided to pool resources to improve technical \nassistance effectiveness, in part by reducing transaction costs for the Government, and to \nenhance impact. To this end there will be a Multi-partner PFM Trust Fund, which will be hosted \nby the World Bank in cooperation with the Australian Agency for International Development \n(AusAID), the Department for International Development (United Kingdom) (DFID), and the \nEuropean Commission.2 Interested partners have already held preliminary discussions on the \ntrust fund arrangements and are in the process of agreeing on its legal and administrative \ncharacteristics. It is expected that the trust fund will become operational in January 2005.   \n \n                                               \n1 WB-ADB. 2003.
