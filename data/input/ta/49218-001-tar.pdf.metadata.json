INTRODUCTION \n1.  Key  Indicators  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  prepared  by  the  Economic  Research  and \nRegional  Cooperation Department,  is  one  of the  annual flagship  publications  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). It provides the latest comprehensive compendium and analysis of \ntrends in economic, social, financial, and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) and Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal (SDG) indicators of ADB\u2019s regional members.1 It also contains a special \nchapter with in-depth, data-intensive analysis of an important policy issue. In general, Key \nIndicators offers strong data and information support for evidence-based policymaking.2 \n \n2.  Key Indicators is considered a premier knowledge product of ADB, consistently among \nthe top downloaded ADB publications over the last 5 years. The proposed regional research \nand development technical assistance (TA) will support the preparation of the 48th edition of the \npublication, which will continue to supply high-quality statistics and economic analysis to meet \nincreasing demand for knowledge for development. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The region\u2019s experience with economic growth\u2014wherein concerns have been raised \nabout its lack of inclusiveness\u2014indicates a need to assess rigorously the types of policy and \ninstitutional  frameworks  needed  for  more  inclusive  development.4 A  number  of  topics  are \nimportant in this context and require timely empirical analysis. Additionally, to assist analysis \nand decision making, an improved statistics portal, which disseminates information regarding \nstatistics resources available in ADB and offers helpful facts on non-ADB data resources, and a \nstatistical database system (SDBS), which features a user-friendly interface, automation, and \nstatistics on a variety of economic and social themes, is also needed. Overall, the TA will make \nKey  Indicators  more  responsive  to  the  developing  member  countries\u2019  (DMCs)  knowledge \ndemand in the following ways.    \n \n4.  First, the project aims to add a supplement to the Key Indicators report. Like the report, \nthe supplement will include a special chapter dealing with an important policy issue for the \nregion, and for which analysis of survey data (especially at household and enterprise levels) is \nnecessary to shed useful light on policy issues. Candidate topics for the two special chapters \nare  (i)  the  role  of  information  and  communication  technology  (ICT)  in  development, \n(ii) entrepreneurship, (iii) urbanization and jobs, and (iv) global value chains (GVCs).5 \n \n                                                \n1  The SDGs have been formally adopted as the new framework for monitoring future international development \ninitiatives. http://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/mdg.shtml (last accessed on 19 November 2015) \n2  The Key Indicators 2015 had five major parts: Part I\u2014the special chapter; Part II\u2014the MDGs; Part III\u2014the regional \ntables; and Part IV\u2013\u2013the global value chains. A fifth part\u2014country tables containing socioeconomic data of ADB \ndeveloping member countries, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand\u2014is only available online and also disseminated \non USB flash drive. \n3  The  TA  received  concept  clearance  from  the  Office  of  the  Vice-President  (Knowledge  Management  and \nSustainable Development) on 30 October 2015, and first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s \nwebsite on 9 November 2015. \n4  This concern is based on various types of evidence, such as rising income inequality as captured by household \nincome and expenditure surveys, reductions in the share of aggregate value added going to labor, persistence of \nemployment in low-paid jobs in the informal sector, and/or a growing share of \u201ccontract\u201d work in many ADB \ndeveloping member countries since 2001. For details, see R. Kanbur, C. Rhee, and J. Zhuang, eds. 2014. \nInequality in Asia and the Pacific: Trends, Drivers and Policy Implications. Manila: Asian Development Bank. \n5  While inclusive development is the primary focus of these topics, analysis through the lens of environmentally \nsustainable growth will also be conducted wherever appropriate. \n ", "2  \n5.  Inclusive growth is about creating equal opportunities for people, and ICT offers much \nequalizing potential. ICT has now begun to affect the lives of the middle class as well as the \nlow-income families, and carries the potential to influence their thinking and behavior profoundly. \nFor instance, ICT applications such as mobile banking and \u201ce-wallet\u201d have promoted financial \ninclusion in many areas where access to financial services was a challenge. Internet-based e-\ncommerce not only helps people purchase cheap products conveniently, but also enables them \nto start their own businesses and sell customized products far away from their home. In fact, \nICT has been playing an increasingly significant role in promoting inclusive development. A \nstudy that contains innovative analysis of cutting-edge application of ICT to development will \ngreatly help inform policymakers in the DMCs. \n \n6.  Entrepreneurship plays a key role in transforming innovation into productivity and jobs. \nThe topic on entrepreneurship and innovation in Asia will be explored through the lens of Asian \nfirms. The study will first present the stylized facts on the growth of firms in the manufacturing \nand service sectors of selected DMCs, describing which types of firms have been the drivers of \nproductivity  growth  and  employment  creation,  and  investigating  the  factors\u2014policy  and \notherwise\u2014that influence firms\u2019 decisions, e.g., to adopt new technologies, invest in innovation, \nenter new markets. The study will then delve into the types of regulation and public support \nrequired to spur entrepreneurship and innovation among the region's firms. Overall, it will give \nguidance  on  what  can  be  done  to  promote  firms\u2019  productivity  to  better  support  countries\u2019 \ninclusive development at different income levels. \n \n7.  While  Asia  is  rapidly  urbanizing  and  its  cities  are  the  locus  of  much  structural \ntransformation, the nature of some of these urbanizations does not seem to be particularly \nconducive to cities meeting their potential as engines of growth. Moreover, concerns arise about \nthe ability of emerging cities to generate \u201cgood jobs\u201d for the medium- and less-skilled workers \nthat dominate, and will continue to dominate, Asian workforces. Therefore, it is proposed to look \ninto the topic of \u201cFuture of Asian Cities: Urbanization and Jobs\u201d as a special chapter in Key \nIndicators 2017. To start with, stylized facts on Asian cities with respect to their size, mode of \nformation, and governance and regulation will be developed. These will then pave the way for \nthe examination of the evolving structure of production and employment across different types \nof cities. In particular, the project could look into how policies on land use regulations and public \ndecision-making processes\u2014e.g., the role of local governments in planning and financing of \nurban infrastructure and services\u2014impact firms\u2019 formation and growth, and job creation. The \nstudy aims to shed light on the sound urban policies and institutions that Asian cities should \nadopt to promote inclusive growth.  \n \n8.  Expansion of the GVCs has accelerated, involving the production of goods and services \nthrough interlinked stages of production scattered across national borders. Asia and the Pacific, \nas a region, has been the most active participant in this wave of GVC expansion thanks to its \nconducive economic environment, e.g., lower labor cost, fewer trade barriers, and efficiency in \nlogistics. Despite the enormous benefits to entrepreneurs and workers in Asia and the Pacific, \nhowever, very few quantitative measures are available and the labor market link is poorly \nunderstood. Moreover, the innovation-driven process of task unbundling as well as dramatic \nreshuffling and mergers in the GVC network are likely to characterize future GVC development. \nHow should the firms and labor force respond? How should public policy be informed and driven \nto ensure that the region continues to enjoy the benefits of GVCs? Based on the latest GVC \nliterature, the project will conduct policy-related research to better understand the dynamics of \nGVCs,  and  inform  policymakers  so  as  to  maximize  development  effects.  Therefore,  it  is \nproposed  to  look  into  the  topic  of  the  GVCs  as  another  potential  special  chapter  in  Key \nIndicators 2017. \n ", "  3\n \n9.  Second, building on the work carried out for Key Indicators 2015, the TA will enable \nstatistics-related work on GVCs to become a regular feature of Key Indicators. These statistics \nare the results of initiatives taken by ADB\u2019s Development Economics and Indicators Division to \npioneer  the  production of  original  data  and  information  and  so facilitate quantification  and \nanalysis of the phenomenon of international production sharing in the globalized economy. \nWhile measuring the scale and structure of a GVC is highly complicated, Koopman, Wang, and \nWei  (2014) 6  and  Wang,  Wei,  and  Zhu  (2013) 7  provide  a  powerful  framework  to  the \nmeasurement. Building on these developments, the proposed study will help the DMCs to \nimprove data collection for more credible measurement and policy analysis of GVC issues. \n \n10.  Third, most tables and figures provided by Key Indicators are sourced from ADB\u2019s \nstatistics portal and SDBS. The process of data generation and validation to populate the SDBS \ninvolves  a  lot  of  back-and-forth  stages,  many  of  which  are  time-consuming  for  the  DMC \ncounterparts as well as ADB staff. An upgrade of ADB\u2019s statistics portal and SDBS will enable \neasier access to the latest information in real time in a more user-friendly interface for the DMC \nstakeholders. It will also help increase data sources, allow for harmonization and visualization \nacross surveys, and provide more flexibility in system maintenance. Options for integration with \nother international portals to enrich its contents, widen its scope, and increase its usage and \nrelevance will also be explored. Furthermore, the upgrade will guarantee continued delivery of \nhigh-quality statistics, reports, and relevant studies, and support several ongoing statistical \nactivities linked to the Key Indicators publication in a more efficient manner. \n \n11.  Finally, the project will support some follow-up studies on topics related to the Key \nIndicators special chapters, and preliminary studies to explore strategically significant topics for \nfuture Key Indicators editions. Publication of Key Indicators by no means suggests conclusion of \nthe studies on the topics covered in the special chapters. More often, it provokes thoughtful \nfeedback and interesting discussions within and outside ADB. In this case, some follow-up \nstudies could generate considerable knowledge returns. For subsequent editions, the Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department will continue to focus on themes related to \ninclusive development. Candidate topics may include skill mobility, multidimensional poverty \nindex, and infrastructure for inclusive development. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of Key Indicators 2017 will be high-quality statistics and economic analysis to \nmeet increasing demand for knowledge for development in the DMCs supported. The outcome \nwill be that by the end of 2018, policymakers, economic researchers in and outside ADB, and \nthe public at large make sustained use of Key Indicators analysis, and its data and information \nsupport system. Potential performance targets would be citations by major newspapers and \npublications,  and  usage  of  Key  Indicators  contents  in  corporate  materials  and  planning \ndocuments. \n \n                                                \n6  R.

Quantifying International Production Sharing at the Bilateral and Sector Levels. \nWorking Paper No. 19677. National Bureau of Economic Research. \n ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will support Key Indicators 2017 by (i) preparing background research papers for \nthe special chapters of the Key Indicators; (ii) implementing the modernization of the ADB \nstatistics portal and SDBS; and (iii) publishing and disseminating the Key Indicators. The inputs \nfor the Key Indicators are highly data intensive. One major impediment to timely completion of \nthe outputs is delays or obstacles in accessing necessary data. \n \n14.  The special chapters will rely on several types of analyses, such as (i) literature review \nencompassing theory and empirics of the topics finally selected, (ii) descriptive and causal \nanalysis of relevant cross-country as well as intracountry data sets, and (iii) country case \nstudies using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Workshops and seminars will be \nheld with key researchers, government officials, policymakers, and other stakeholders. These \nworkshops  and  seminars  are  crucial for (i)  discussing  the general  direction  of the special \nchapters, (ii) developing the story lines of the special chapters, and (iii) firming up the initial \nfindings of the background research papers. Distinguished experts will be invited to give their \nviews so that the outputs of the workshops will be useful in finalizing the Key Indicators. \nResearch, consultations, and discussions with staff from regional and other departments of ADB \nwill also be conducted to further validate the relevance of the research findings, and to pinpoint \nemerging concerns that can be potential topics for future Key Indicators. \n \n15.  On the statistics side, the TA will conduct a review and update of the current set of MDG \nand SDG indicators. In addition, GVC-related indicators will be prepared and included in the \nstatistics tables as a theme of importance to policymaking and unique part of the Key Indicators \nstatistical presentation. Modernization of the statistics portal and SDBS will require undertaking \na comprehensive review of the existing data repositories and portals from both architectural and \ncontent perspectives. A plan will then be developed to upgrade the portal and SDBS\u2014(i) identify \npriority  areas  for  modernization  based  on  user  feedback  and  requests,  (ii)  propose  new \nfunctionalities to be added to the portal, (iii) select a new system or process to be used, \n(iv) implement changes to the statistics portal and SDBS by balancing business and technical \nrequirements, and (v) regularly update and maintain the two databases. Proper documentation \nof the applied changes and enhancements will be produced and disseminated as well. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $935,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). Appendix 2 presents the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  this  TA.  The  Development  Economics  and \nIndicators Division will be the TA supervising unit and will coordinate with other ADB units \n(regional departments and resident missions) and statistical partners in ADB regional members \nin undertaking the activities for this TA. The project will be implemented over 36 months, from \n1 January 2016 to its targeted completion on 31 December 2018. \n \n18.  Key Indicators is produced by a team of international, national, and administrative staff \nof the Development Economics and Indicators Division with support from international and \nnational consultants. An estimated 18 person-months of international and 133 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be needed for the 2017 edition and its supplements, i.e., the \n ", "  5\nspecial chapters, the statistical tables (country, MDG and SDG, and regional tables), special \npilot indicators or datasets, the statistics portal and SDBS, and activities to improve data quality \nand promote effective dissemination of results and findings. \n \n19.  For the special chapters, the international and national consultants will work on the \nanalysis and write-up for a theme of interest (to be finalized), prepare background reports and \noriginal research related to the theme, and provide some manuscript and economics editing. \nThe national consultants will assist in data gathering, data cleaning and update of indicators, \nfurther research on the indicators, layout of text and tables, and manuscript and copy editing. \nSurveys may be conducted in selected DMCs as deemed necessary to enhance the relevance \nof the analysis. \n \n20.  For the statistical tables, the international consultants will review data issues pertaining \nto the statistical tables published in Key Indicators, and propose viable imputation procedures \nfor selected important indicators compiled in the publication. The national consultants will assist \nin preparing the statistical tables and commentaries, layout of text and tables, and manuscript \nand copy editing. International and national consultants will also be utilized to develop a new set \nof indicators on a topic of importance to economic policymaking. \n \n21.  For the upgrade of ADB\u2019s statistics portal and SDBS, national information technology \nand data specialists will conduct a comprehensive cleaning, review, and assessment of the \nexisting data, databases, data sources, and the newly procured additional datasets; develop a \nsystem modernization plan; and produce additional functionalities and changes in the statistics \nportal  as  indicated  in  the  plan.  All  datasets  such  as  basic  statistics,  quarterly  economic \nindicators,  other  external  databases,  household  survey  datasets,  and  tools  that  can  be \ndeveloped into the statistics portal resources will also be brought in. \n \n22.  Resource  persons  will  be  engaged  for  the  workshops  and  training  events  to  be \nconducted, e.g., Key Indicators workshops for the special chapters, training on a theme of \ninterest (to be finalized), and subregional workshops for the statistical tables. Travel of ADB staff \nparticipating in related workshops, conferences, or seminars as resource persons may also be \nsupported, following the appropriate administrative guidelines. \n \n23.  The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3 and the publication \noutline in Appendix 4. The consultants will be hired as individuals and will be engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n24.  Key Indicators will be widely disseminated to the target audience in coordination with \nADB\u2019s Department of External Relations. Dissemination will start with an international media \nlaunch  followed  by  seminar  presentations  to  key  government  officials,  business  people, \nacademia, and other research groups. Concurrently, the edition will be uploaded to the ADB \nwebsite. Background papers will be published separately in ADB\u2019s working paper series, the \nAsian Development Review, or other media at a later date. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $935,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific 2017, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nHigh-quality statistics and economic analysis to meet increasing demand for knowledge for development \nin the DMCs supported (defined by project). \n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome:  By 2018:     \nSustained use of KI  a.
