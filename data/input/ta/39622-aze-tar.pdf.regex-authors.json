During discussions with the Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Country \nStrategy and Program Update (CSPU) 2006, energy was identified as one of the priority areas \nfor assistance. In July 2005, a rapid assessment of the energy sector (RAES) was undertaken. \nAfter reviewing the RAES, in October 2005 the Government requested Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  assistance  to  develop  a  priority  renewable  energy  project  and  include  an \naccompanying project preparatory technical assistance (TA).1 The concept paper for the TA was \napproved in November 2005. The project and the TA are included in the draft CSPU 2006.          \nA reconnaissance mission2 visited Azerbaijan during 17\u201323 October 2005. Discussions were \nheld with the Government on the impacts, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Azerbaijan is in its 14th year of transition following its independence in 1991. Like other \nformer  Soviet  Union  countries,  it  experienced  an  initial  period  (1990\u20131995)  of  dramatic \neconomic collapse losing the gross domestic product (GDP) by 60%. The turnaround began in \n1995, but economic growth was sluggish up to 2000, when it started to accelerate mainly due to \nincreased oil export revenue. However, the GDP in 2003 was still about 20% below the 1990 \nlevel in real terms. GDP growth is projected to remain buoyant at least up to 2010, driven by the \nrapid expansion of oil and gas production and export. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) \nhas projected that the GDP will grow by 21% in 2005 and 38% in 2006.   \n \n3.  Despite recent economic growth, in 2003 about 45% of the population lived below the \npoverty line and 10% below extreme poverty. The incidence of income poverty is greatest \namong households in provincial towns, the rural areas are deficient in access to services, and \nthere are significant regional variations in poverty rates.3 The country\u2019s high growth trajectory \nhas raised people\u2019s expectations of sharing the wealth, but economic growth needs to be \nemployment intensive to contribute to poverty reduction.4 The Government is committed to \nremoving poverty and developing the non-oil sector, and it plans to create job opportunities to \nachieve balanced and sustainable growth.  \n \n4.  Energy is a vital input to support sector growth in the non-oil services and industry \nsectors. The energy sector plays a central role in the economy, contributing one third of the \nGDP in 2004, making it the largest segment. With export of oil from the recently completed                \nBaku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Ceyhan pipeline and the expected completion of the South Caucasus Gas Pipeline \nin 2006, the share will be even larger. While the country has been successful in engaging the \nprivate sector for developing and exporting its oil and gas resources, the domestic energy sector \nis threatened by systemic collapse due to limited maintenance of aging infrastructure and               \nunderinvestment.  The  dichotomy  of  strong  oil  and  gas export  and  a  failing  energy  supply \ndomestically is possible because the offshore oil and gas exploration activities are self-sufficient \nin energy.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 8 November 2005. \n2  The reconnaissance mission was upgraded to the technical assistance (TA) fact-finding in view of the agreement \nreached with the Government on all aspects of TA, and the request to expedite the processing of the TA. Quality \naspects have been given due consideration and the preparation includes the dialogue and information collected \nduring the preparation of rapid assessment of the energy sector (RAES).  \n3  Nackichivan region has the highest poverty level (59.2%), whereas Baku has the lowest (35.4%). \n4  The unemployment rate in 2003 was 10.7%, a decrease of 0.6% from 2002 figures.  \n ", "2   \n5.   Azerbaijan inherited a domestic energy sector\u2014power, natural gas (gas) and heat\u2014that \nwas capable of providing acceptable services to almost 100% population and fully met the \ndemand of its economy. Gas has been the dominant source of primary energy, it was the \nprimary fuel for power generation and space heating, but was imported mainly from Russia. \nSoon after independence, the gas supply to Azerbaijan was disrupted.5 The restricted gas \nsupply had serious impacts on the domestic energy supply\u2014power plants were switched to oil, \nthe reticulated gas supply remained available to only the large urban areas and industries, and \nthe district heating system collapsed, causing high consumption of electricity during the winter \nmonths. With the economic recovery, gas import was resumed in 2001 but the restoration of \nenergy infrastructure\u2014power, gas, and heat\u2014is slow, especially outside Baku.  \n \n6.  In the power sector, the generation capacity comprises a mix of hydropower (19%) and \nthermal  power  plants  (81%).  The  available  power  generation  capacity 6  is  about                        \n4.2 gigawatts (GW) compared with the estimated peak demand of about 5\u2013GW. The efficiency \nof  the  existing  thermal  power  plant  is  very  low  and  is  further  deteriorating.  Compared  to           \n364 grams of oil equivalent/kilowatt-hour (g/kWh) in 1991, the average efficiency of the thermal \npower plants in 2003 was 410 g/kWh. A modern combined-cycle power plant in comparison can \nachieve 182 g/kWh (about 47% overall efficiency). Due to an aging transmission and distribution \ninfrastructure, network losses have also risen from 13.6% in 1995 to 18.2% in 2003. Low power \nplant efficiency and high losses lead to wastage of fossil fuels that could have been exported, \nand  nearly  double  the  emissions  of  carbon  dioxide,  a  major  greenhouse  gas,  and  other \npollutants that damage the regional and global environment. \n \n7.  Insufficient  power  generation  capacity,  aging  and  overloaded  transmission  and \ndistribution infrastructure, obsolete protection and control equipment result in acute peak power \nshortages and poor quality of power supply (lower voltages, frequent blackouts). Transmission \nbottlenecks further constrain power imports from regional interconnections with neighboring \ncountries.7 Planned power outages8 are common in regional areas.9 About 3 GW generation \ncapacity has to be added by 2013 to meet the projected demand growth. 10 The Government \naims to fully meet the power demand and has drawn a plan11 for additional capacity, mainly \nthrough rehabilitation of existing thermal power plants and new gas-fired power plants located \ncloser to the major load centers. However, because of serious transmission and distribution \nconstraints, those measures are unlikely to provide relief to regional consumers located at the \nfar end of the network.  \n \n8.  About  48%  of  the  country\u2019s  8.3  million  people  live  in  the  rural  areas,  often  with \ninsufficient access to quality basic services. Lack of power, gas, and heat has aggravated the \nregional imbalance in the country. While the Baku region has access to reliable energy supply, \nother areas are experiencing extreme difficulty in meeting their basic energy needs. Poor-quality \nand unreliable electricity supply inhibits industrial and commercial activities, thus constraining \n                                                 \n5  Gas supplies were disrupted due to chronic nonpayment, disagreement with transit parties, security, thefts, as well \nas geopolitical issues.  \n6  The nameplate installed rating is 5.1 gigawatts, which has been derated due to aging and maintenance problems. \n7  Power exchange with Georgia is negligible; single interconnection with Russia is operating at full capacity; Armenia \ninterconnection is non-operational due to territorial disputes. No net power exchange with Iran, interconnection with \nTurkey is limited to Nackichivan area, not connected to Azerbaijan grid.  \n8 During the peak winter months of 2004\u20132005, power to regional areas was disconnected for 10\u201314 hours per day. \n9  Azerbaijan has 59 districts that are divided into nine regions. Baku has benefited directly from the recent economic \ngrowth, and the Government\u2019s attention is now shifting to the remaining eight regions. \n10 Based on Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). 2003.

In many areas, decentralized generation through alternative and renewable energy, \nmainly  small  hydropower  (SHP)  and  wind  power,  offers  a  competitive  and                     \nenvironmental-friendly  option  to  meet  power  shortages.  SHP  and  wind  power  potential  is \nestimated to be about 4 GW, about 75% from wind power. The poorest region (footnote 3) in the \ncountry\u2014Nackichivan region\u2014is physically cutoff from the power grid and relies on local energy \nsources  and  imports  from  neighboring  countries  for  its  power  needs.  Recent  studies  by \nKreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  and  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction                        \nand Development (EBRD) have concluded that Azerbaijan has good SHP and wind power \npotential. The prefeasibility studies suggest that decentralized SHP and wind power projects will \nhave economic benefits and will meet the power needs of many areas in Absheron peninsula \nand Nackichivan. The Government recognizes the importance of decentralized generation using \nrenewable and alternative energy sources, and has formulated the State Program on Use of \nAlternative  and  Renewable  Energy  Sources  (October  2004).  The  program  highlights  the \nimportance of harnessing SHP and wind power potential to improve power supply in many \nareas, and diversify its energy resource base to ensure long-term energy security.  \n \n10.  The Ministry of Industry and Energy (MIE) is mandated to implement the state program \non development of alternative and renewable energy (para. 9). Through its participation in \nPromotion  of  Renewable  Energy  and  Greenhouse  Gas  Abatement  (PREGA)  activities \nunder an ADB regional TA, the Government has reinforced its commitment to promote \nrenewable energy in the country.  \n \n11.  Due to the share of the domestic energy sector in the economy and a large subsidy \n(approximately 15% of GDP in 2003), the Government with the support of other international \nfinancial institutions (IFI) has focused on sector reforms and policy issues. Significant progress \nhas  been  made  to  streamline  sector  structure,  improve  fiscal  discipline  and  transparency, \npromote tariff reforms, and seek private sector participation. Most important, four concessions \nfor managing power distribution have been awarded.12 \n \n12.  Development of renewable and clean energy sources to provide direct benefits to the \nrural poor is a priority of ADB\u2019s energy policy. Accelerating rural development by strengthening \nregional infrastructure and services is a strategic focus of its country program. The strategy is \ndesigned to support the State Program on Poverty Reduction and Economic Development \n(SPRED),  and  aims  for  balanced  regional  development  through  physical  and  social \ninfrastructure  improvement.  In  the  energy  sector,  the  strategy  focuses  on  supporting  the \nongoing sector reforms and mitigating environmental impacts. The proposed project will be \ndesigned to synergize ongoing intervention to restore the social infrastructure in the same \nareas.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n12 The  institutional  arrangements  are  described  in  an  ADB-PPIAF  report.

The project impact will be a reduction of the regional imbalance in economic growth with \nreliable and environmentally clean energy supply. The TA outcome will be an agreement on \nproject design, feasibility study, and implementation arrangements. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  The project preparatory TA will be carried out in two phases. During the first phase, the \nconsultant will (i) review and update all relevant studies, analyses, and data on renewable \nenergy resources, audit the data, and disaggregate resource endowment on a geographical \nbasis; (ii) review demand forecasts, develop screening criteria, and recommend the priority \narea(s)  for  the  project;  (iii)  undertake  least-cost  analysis  to  identify  appropriate  renewable \nenergy  options;  (iv)  identify  and  rank  bankable  renewable  energy  projects\u2014financing, \ninstitutional/organizational  setup  etc.;  (v)  undertake  skills  and  resource  audit  of                        \nMIE (the Executing Agency) and identify capacity-building measures to implement the project \nand the state plan on the use of alternative and renewable energy; (vi) examine potential \nbarriers\u2014technical, institutional, financial, regulatory\u2014and recommend policies and incentives \nfor  streamlining  and  accelerating  promotion  of  renewable  energy;  (vii)  disseminate  initial \nfindings through targeted workshops and seminars to stakeholders.  \n \n15.  During the second phase, the consultant will (i) refine the techno-economic feasibility \nstudies of selected priority projects; (ii) prepare a project loan proposal for ADB consideration, \nincluding the necessary documents under the safeguard policy; and (iii) identify the potential for \ncarbon  emission  reduction  under  the  clean  development  mechanism  (CDM)  and  other \nincentives available under the Global Environment Fund (GEF). \n \n16.   The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation include (i) a change in MIE priorities, (ii) lack of adequate and time by provision \nof data, (iii) delayed in submission of required studies, (iv) delayed in consultant selection and \npoor consultant performance. Efforts will be made to ensure that competent consultants will be \nrecruited expeditiously. MIE agrees to provide adequate counterpart support and data when \nneeded. It also agrees to undertake and update all required studies according to a timetable \nagreed upon with ADB. Close coordination among the consultants, executing and implementing \nagencies, and ADB will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  will  be  $900,000  equivalent.  ADB  will  finance  $700,000 \nequivalent on a grant basis, which will comprise $200,000 financed by the Government of \nFinland,  and  administered  by  ADB,  and  the  balance  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The \nGovernment will finance the remaining $200,000 through in-kind contribution, including office \naccommodation and facilities, counterpart staff and data and other information needed for the \nTA. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. The Government has been \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  MIE  will  be  the  Executing  Agency.  MIE  will  provide  a  TA  leader  for  day-to-day \nmanagement  of  implementation.  A  steering  committee  or  a  lead  group  comprising \nrepresentatives  of  key  relevant  ministries  and  agencies\u2014Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \nEnvironment and National Resources, National Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment etc., will be set up by the Government, within 2 weeks of the start of TA activities \nto oversee and guide TA implementation.  \n \n19.  The TA will be carried out over a 10 months period by a team of international and \ndomestic consultants. The TA is expected to commence in February 2006 and be completed by \nDecember  2006.  The  total  input  of  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be                        \n16 and 34 person-months, respectively. The consultants will procure office equipment13 and will \ndeliver it to MIE at the conclusion of the TA. \n \n20.  The  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  using  the                 \nquality- and cost-based selection procedure using simplified technical proposals. The following \ninternational consultants will be required (person-months are in parentheses): (i) a renewable \nenergy development specialist (6), (ii) an institutional development specialist (2), (iii) a power \neconomist  (3),  (iv)  a  financial  analyst  (3),  (v)  a  social/poverty  specialist  (1),  and                        \n(vi)  an  environmental  specialist  (1).  The  following  domestic  consultants  will  be  required                        \n(person-months are in parentheses): (i) two renewable energy development specialists (6 each), \n(ii)  an  institutional  development  specialist  (4),  (iii)  a  power  economist  (6),                        \n(iv)  a  financial  analyst  (6),  (v)  a  social/poverty  specialist  (3),  and  (vi)  an  environmental               \nspecialist (3). Outline terms of reference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n  \n21.  The consultant will submit an inception report within 1 month after TA commencement, \nan interim report after 3 months, a midterm report after 4 months, a draft final report after              \n8 months. The final report will be submitted within 10 months of the TA commencement. \nWorkshops will be held at each of the subproject sites to seek local community and project \nbeneficiaries\u2019  views  on  improving  the  project  design;  stakeholder  participation  will  be \nencouraged through workshops and seminars to progressively discuss and share the results of \nthe TA. Roundtable conferences with key stakeholders will be organized after submission of \neach of the milestone reports.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved               \n(i) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 \nto be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the \nRepublic of Azerbaijan for preparing the Renewable Energy Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n13  Including four pentium computers, two photocopiers, two laser printers, one multimedia projector with screen, one \ndigital camera, and two facsimile machines.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nReduction of regional  Increased utilization of  National and regional  \u2022 Government confirms to \nimbalance in economic  renewable energy   statistics   extend priority and resources \ngrowth with reliable and      to promote renewable \nenvironmentally clean  Augmented power supply  Regional power data  energy. \nenergy supply  to rural communities      \n    \u2022 Project design is \nDeveloped institutional    implemented effectively. \nand financial management     \naction plan   \n \n       \nOutcome     \nAssumption \n     \nProject design, feasibility  Memorandum of  Consultant\u2019s final report  \u2022 Effective stakeholder \nstudy, and implementation  understanding of final  Memorandum of  participation and ownership \narrangements agreed  tripartite meeting signed  understanding, back-to-office  are developed. \nupon  by Government and the  report of final technical   \nAsian Development Bank   assistance review mission  Risk \n\u2022 Key stakeholders do not \nagree with the technical \nassessment.  \n \n       \nOutput      Assumptions: \n       \nTechnical assessments  Inception report, week 4  Project reports  \u2022 There is no restriction on \ncompleted, and design  interim report, week 20   TA reviews, weeks 6, 21, and  availability of information and \nrequirements met  draft final report, week 30  32  personnel and timely access \n  final report, week 40  to them. \n \n\u2022 There is no restriction on \naccessing geographic sites. \n \n \n   \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs: $900,000 \n   \n1.
