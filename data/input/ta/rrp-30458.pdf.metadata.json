The Project will support the Government\u2019s\npolicy reform initiatives by pilot-testing modifications in the\nState  procurement  system  for  cotton  and  wheat,\nstrengthening rural institutions to support private farming,\nand rehabilitating infrastructure to increase crop productivity,\nwith a view to improving farm income in the short run and\nsustaining  agricultural  development  in  the  long  run.  The\nProject  will  substantially  reduce  the  State  procurement\nburden on farmers, strengthen the newly established rural\nbusiness advisory centers (RBACs), establish water users\u2019\nassociations (WUAs), rehabilitate 37,000 hectares (ha) of\nirrigation  and  drainage  systems,  and  provide  farm\nmachinery  services.  The  Project\u2019s  experiences  in  policy\nreform and institutional strengthening are expected to be\nreplicated nationwide.\nClassification Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Protection\nEnvironmental Assessment Category  B.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was\nundertaken  which  indicated  that  the  Project  will  have  no\nmajor  adverse  environmental  impacts  since  most  of  the\ncomponents comprise rehabilitation works.\nRationale Uzbekistan  has  experienced  continuing  decline  in  cotton\nproduction in recent years. This has seriously affected the\ncountry\u2019s balance of payments, resulted in widespread farm\nlosses,  and  caused  serious  social  and  environmental\nproblems. The deterioration of the irrigation and drainage\nsystems  and  degradation  of  farmland  have  affected\nagricultural  production  in  the  country.  The  Government\ninitiated  a  reform  package  in  1999  to  promote  farm\nrestructuring,  increase  State  procurement  prices,  and\nreduce  farm  losses.  These  measures  have  significantly\nimproved  the  farms\u2019  financial  status  in  the  short  run.\nPursuant to policy dialogue with ADB, the Government in\nMay 2001 introduced major policy reforms in Ak Altin Rayon\nby  replacing  the  production  target  with  much  reduced\nprocurement  quota  for  cotton  and  wheat,  and  abolishing", "ii\njoint responsibility for fulfilling the procurement quota. With\nthese reforms, the farmers now have better prospects to\nsustain  their  operations  if  the  remaining  constraints  are\naddressed in an urgent manner. By providing institutional\nsupport  for  private  farming  and  rehabilitating  the\ndeteriorated irrigation and drainage systems, the Project will\ncontribute to a financially viable and sustainable agriculture,\nand  substantially  improve  the  living  standards  of  about\n50,400 beneficiaries in the Project area.\nObjectives and Scope The  Project  will  promote  agricultural  development  on  a\nsustainable  basis.  The  primary  objective  is  to  improve\nagricultural performance and increase farm income in Ak\nAltin  district;  the  secondary  objective  is  environmental\nprotection. The Project will comprise four components: (i)\ninstitutional  support,  monitoring,  and  evaluation;  (ii)\nrehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems; (iii) farm\nmachinery services; and (iv) project management.\nCost Estimates The  total  project  cost  is  estimated  at  $72.0  million\nequivalent, composed of $38.7 million in foreign exchange\nand $33.3 million equivalent in local currency.\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total   Percent\nAsian Development Bank 35.2 0.8 36.0 50.0\nGovernment 3.5 30.5 34.0 47.3\nBeneficiaries 0.0 2.0 2.0 2.7\nTotal 38.7 33.3 72.0 100.0\nLoan Amount and Terms The  loan  of  $36.0  million  equivalent  from  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank's (ADB's) ordinary capital resources will\nhave a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nwith interest calculated in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable lending rate system for US dollar loans, an annual\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a front-end fee of 1\npercent.\n  Period of Utilization Until 31 March 2007", "iii\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources (MAWR)\nImplementation A  high-level  project  steering  committee  chaired  by  the\nArrangements Deputy  Prime  Minister  in  charge  of  Ministry  of\nMacroeconomics  and  Statistics,  and  an  interministerial\nworking group have been established to address issues that\nneed interagency coordination. A deputy minister of MAWR\nhas been designated as project director to oversee project\nimplementation.  The  Rural  Restructuring  Agency  (RRA)\nunder MAWR will be responsible for project implementation.\nA project management office (PMO) has been established to\nmanage day-to-day project implementation, with a project\nsite office (PSO) in Ak Altin to supervise field activities. A\ndistrict  consultation  committee  comprising  beneficiary\nrepresentatives  will  monitor  project  implementation  and\nliaise with the PSO.\nProcurement The Project will procure machinery, equipment, civil works,\nservices,  as  well  as  vehicles,  office  equipment,  and\nmaterials. All procurement will be undertaken in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nConsulting Services The Project will provide for 263 person-months of consulting\nservices (65 international and 198 domestic) to assist the\nPMO and PSO in (i) design, monitoring and evaluation of\npilot  farms;  (ii)  carrying  out  surveys  and  investigations,\npreparing  and  reviewing  designs,  and  supervising\nconstruction of on-farm and interfarm irrigation and drainage\nfacilities;  and  (iii)  project  management.  The  consulting\nservices  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to the ADB for the engagement of\ndomestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 30 September 2006\n   Completion Date\nProject Benefits and The  Project  will  directly  benefit  about  50,400  people  or\n   Beneficiaries 9,640 families in the Project area; most of them are farm\nworkers and their families on the large cooperative farms\nthat have incurred losses, as well as private farmers and\nother  rural  residents.  Over  50  percent  of  the  potential\nbeneficiaries  are  women.  The  Project  is  expected  to\nincrease cotton yield from the current (year 2000) 1.59 ton\n(t)/ha to 3 t/ha, and wheat yield from 2.19 t/ha to 3.7 t/ha in\neight  years.

THE PROPOSAL\n1.  I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed loan\nto the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project. The report also\ndescribes  proposed  technical  assistance  for  Institutional  Support  for  Sustainable  Agricultural\nDevelopment, and if the proposed loan is approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority\ndelegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical assistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2.  A feasibility study for the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project was carried out from\nSeptember 1997 to April 1998 under an Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance\n(TA).1  The  consultants'  findings  and  their  reports  were  discussed  with  the  Government.  A\nReconnaissance Mission visited the country in September 1998, followed by a Fact-Finding\nMission during November-December 1998, a Follow-up Fact-Finding Mission during August-\nSeptember 1999, an Appraisal Mission in November 1999, and Follow-up Missions in October\n2000 and May 2001.2 The lengthy period for project processing reflects the intensive policy\ndialogue with the Government on proposed policy reforms under the Project, and the time needed\nfor the Government\u2019s internal deliberations on the policy issues. This report is based on the\nconsultants\u2019 studies, the findings of the missions, and discussions with the national and local\ngovernment agencies concerned as well as farmers in the Project area. The Project framework is\ngiven in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  The Agriculture Sector\n1.  Macroeconomic Context\n3.  Following independence in 1991, Uzbekistan embarked on transition from a command\neconomy to a market system, and adopted a gradual approach with the State playing a central\nrole in managing the transition. This gradual approach performed relatively well in maintaining\npolitical  and  social  stability,  and  the  Uzbek  Government  managed  to  avoid  the  prolonged\nrecessions  encountered  by  the  neighboring  Central  Asian  republics  (CARs),  where  social\ndislocation due to rising poverty and internal conflicts occurred.\n4.  However, the slow pace of the transition has delayed the much-needed structural reforms\nin major sectors of the economy. The State continues to be heavily involved in price control and\nmarket monopoly. Furthermore, prompted by a poor cotton harvest in late 1996, which brought\nsevere pressures on the country\u2019s balance of payments, the Government, after a gradual lowering\nof trade barriers during 1995-1996, introduced a number of administrative measures to control\nimports in late 1996 and 1997. Import restrictions included mandatory registration of import\ncontracts with the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and obligation for importing enterprises\nto  obtain  an  import  license  from  the  Ministry  of  Foreign  Economic  Relations  and a  foreign\n                                                \n1 TA 2798-UZB: Agriculture Sector Development Project, for $1,075,000, approved on 19 May 1997.\n2 The Appraisal Mission comprised E.Q. Ye, Project Economist/Mission Leader; M.A. Malik, Senior Project Specialist;\nS. T. Qadri, Senior Environmental Specialist; G.N. Bestari, Project Economist; V.L. You, Counsel; and S. Khan, Farm\nMachinery Specialist/Staff Consultant. M. A. Malik, Senior Project Specialist/Mission Leader conducted the first\nFollow-up Appraisal Mission. The second Follow-up Mission comprised M. A. Malik, Senior Project Specialist/Mission\nLeader; Tumurdavaa Bayarsaihan, Project Economist; and Rustam Abdukayumov, Portfolio Management Officer,\nADB Uzbekistan Resident Mission.", "2\nexchange license from the Central Bank of Uzbekistan. All import licenses are granted selectively.\nOther restrictive measures that have directly affected foreign trade include (i) centralized export of\ngold and cotton, (ii) foreign exchange surrender requirements for exports, (iii) import quotas for\nbasic food stuff through the tender system, (iv) import tariffs and excise duties set at levels higher\nthan the international norm, and (v) the overvalued official exchange rate. As the policy changes\nintroduced in late 1996 were not in accordance with the International Monetary Fund's standby\narrangement agreed upon in 1995, the International Monetary Fund's program was suspended in\nDecember 1996.\n5.  The tight trade and price controls discouraged export and foreign investment, weakened\nthe  economy,  and  threatened  Uzbekistan\u2019s  balance  of  payments  position.  The  Government\nrecognized the need to reassess the current policy and is engaged in a process of policy review\nand revision. The Cabinet of Ministers (COM) issued on 10 June 1999 a resolution outlining an\nextensive program of policy reform covering the economic, political, and social spheres for the\ncountry to unify the multiple exchange rates. At present; the State procurement price of cotton is\nbased on export parity level using the overvalued official exchange rate; and the cost of less\nefficient processing, handling, and transportation by various government agencies; and effectively\nrepresents an implicit taxation on farms. The unification of the exchange rates, by converting the\nofficial exchange rate to its economic value, will reduce the implicit taxation on farms and bring\nsubstantial gains to the agriculture sector. In particular, export-oriented cotton production will be\npromoted.3\n6.  On 24 June 2001, the Government passed a resolution that substantially changes the\nforeign exchange regime with effect from 1 July 2001. The resolution reduces the number of\nproducts to be traded at official exchange rate and shifts them to the commercial or over the\ncounter (OTC) exchange rate. Export earnings, which are surrendered will be paid at the OTC\nrate, thereby increasing receipts in domestic currency terms by as much as 45 percent. Even the\nexports of cotton and gold beyond a pre-specified limit have been permitted at the OTC rate.  The\nresolution provides the incentives for the exporters.  Small and medium enterprises have also\nbeen allowed to convert their cash earnings at the OTC exchange rate. While the resolution of 24\nJune 2001 represents a move in the right direction, it has still not fully addressed the problems\nassociated with multiple exchange rates.\n2.  Features of the Sector\n7.  Agriculture is the foundation of the Uzbek economy and accounts for about 28 percent of\nthe gross domestic product, 44 percent of employment, and 60 percent of export revenues. About\n56 percent of the country\u2019s 24.8 million people live in the rural areas. The agriculture sector\ncomprises 60 percent of crops and 40 percent of livestock, with cotton and wheat being the two\n                                                \n3  The current official exchange rate is overvalued, and is maintained for currency transactions conducted at the Uzbek\nRepublican Currency Exchange. The primary sources of supply of foreign exchange at the Uzbek Republican\nCurrency Exchange are mandatory sales of foreign exchange proceeds from cotton and gold at the overvalued\nexchange rate. The primary uses of foreign exchange sold through the Uzbek Republican Currency Exchange are\nexternal public debt service and State-approved imports of capital and other goods for supporting State-sponsored\nprograms and projects. The State allows commercial banks and exchange bureaus to conduct foreign exchange\ntransactions. The exchange rates used in the commercial market are formally determined by market forces, but\nmaintained by the State at below the market clearing level. For example, the commercial exchange rate was\nSUM675/690 to $1.00 (actual, May 2001). There is a thriving curb market to cater to the demand for additional foreign\nexchange. The cash curb rate was at SUM920 to $1.00 in May 2001. The official segments of the foreign exchange\ntransactions control the bulk of the total transactions in the country. Accurate estimates of the size of the curb market\nwere difficult to obtain. The high curb rate was also influenced by transaction risks and law enforcement.", "3\nmajor products.4 Uzbekistan was the largest producer of cotton, fruit, and vegetables in the former\nSoviet Union and is now the world\u2019s fifth largest cotton producer and the second largest cotton\nexporter after the United States, accounting for 15 percent of the global cotton trade.\n8.  The  most  salient  feature  of  Uzbek  agriculture  is  the  dominant  role  of  cotton,  which\noccupies 44 percent of the irrigated area and contributes over 40 percent of the country\u2019s export\nearnings. At the macroeconomic level, cotton production in a particular year directly affects the\ncountry\u2019s balance of payments and State budget revenues. The crop is regarded as a strategic\ncommodity. At the micro level, cotton is the primary source of income of farms. Because it is\nlabor-intensive,  cotton  production  is  a  major  source  of  rural  employment,  especially  during\nweeding and harvesting seasons. These features make cotton a critical factor influencing the\ncountry\u2019s political and social stability.\n9.  Another feature of Uzbek agriculture is its reliance on irrigation, which determines the size\nof the cropping area. In Uzbekistan, all cropping area is irrigated, as the continental climate and\nthe concentration of rainfall in the winter months make irrigation an absolute necessity for crop\nproduction. The country\u2019s massive irrigation systems were expanded during the 1960s-1980s\nunder  the  central  planning  system  when  the  State  financed  all  investment  costs  and  was\nresponsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of all irrigation and drainage systems.\n3.  Sector Performance\n10.  The most critical issue in agriculture is the trend of declining cotton production in recent\nyears. Nationwide, cotton outputs declined by over 22 percent from 4.6 million metric tons (t) in\n1991 to 3.6 million t in 2000. In 1998, cotton production was only 3.2 million t, the lowest in 20\nyears. While a part of the decline was attributed to the shift of about 12 percent cotton area to\ngrain production following the Government\u2019s policy of grain self-sufficiency,5 a more worrisome\nconcern was falling crop productivity. Nationwide, cotton yield declined from about 3 t per hectare\n(ha) in the 1980s to 2.7 t/ha in 1991, and further to 2.2 t/ha in 2000. The average cotton yield was\nlowest at 2.1 t/ha in 1998. The declining cotton production led to widespread farm losses and\naccumulated farm debts, which impaired the capacity of farms to pay cash wages regularly to their\nworkers, and the ability of the local communities to pay for social services. As a result, the living\nstandards of farm workers and social services for rural residents deteriorated.\n11.  The poor performance of agriculture was attributed to four basic factors: (i) poor producer\nincentives because of the low output prices fixed under a State order system for cotton and wheat\nprocurement, largely due to the overvalued official exchange rate (para. 5); (ii) excessive State\ninterventions in farm operations, especially the mandatory fulfillment of production targets that\ncontrolled the entire cotton and wheat production of farms; (iii) deterioration of irrigation and\ndrainage systems that led to rising groundwater tables, accelerated soil salinity, and falling crop\nyields; and (iv) lack of timely access to farm machinery services, which delayed farm operations\nand led to low crop yields and poor product quality. In particular, the continued deterioration of the\nirrigation and drainage systems, the degraded farmland, and wasted water (one of the most\n                                                \n4  Uzbekistan has a comparative advantage in cotton production. Its cotton yield is the second highest (after the People's\nRepublic of China) among the top five cotton producers in the world (the People's Republic of China, USA, India,\nPakistan, and Uzbekistan; statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations, 1990-1999).\nEconomic analysis shows that cotton production gives the highest economic return among all crops in the project\narea. While wheat production in Uzbekistan does not have economic returns as high as those from cotton, the\nGovernment considers it politically important to ensure food security through domestic grain production. An important\nfactor underlying the desire for grain self-sufficiency is the landlocked geography of the country amid the political\ninstability in the region.\n5 The total cotton area was reduced from 1.7 million ha in 1991 to 1.5 million ha in 1998 and to 1.45 million ha in 2000.", "4\nvaluable  resources  in  the  country)  have  caused  serious  environmental  concerns,  directly\nthreatening the country\u2019s long-term base for agricultural development.6\n4.  Policy Reforms\n12.  Since  independence  in  1991,  the  Government  has  initiated  reforms  in  both  farm\nprivatization and market liberalization to transform agriculture to a market-based system. Reforms\nin farm privatization started with an increase of household plots allocated to farm employees,\nwhich  immediately  led  to  a  significant  increase  in  household  production  and  productivity.\nConstituting about 10 percent of the country\u2019s irrigated cropland, these household plots now\nproduce most of the country\u2019s vegetables, fruits, meat, and dairy products. The State farms were\ntransformed into collective farms, which were later converted into cooperative farms. However, no\nreal changes occurred in farm management and the incentive structure on these farms, most of\nwhich were still led by the same directors, were incurring losses, and were a heavy financial\nburden to the State budget.\n13.  Recognizing these problems, the Government launched a nationwide program of farm\nrestructuring in 1998-1999 to break down the inefficient cooperative farms. Under the program,\nthe large cooperative farms are being transformed into shirkats (restructured private farms) with\nmeasures to improve farm management and the incentive structure. On a typical shirkat, assets\nare assessed and valued, and members of the farm are given shares of the assets. A family\ncontract  system  has  been  introduced,  with  farm  workers\u2019  rights  and  obligations  tied  to  a\ndemarcated piece of land. Under the family contract system, a farm worker is responsible for\nproducing a certain amount of outputs using a fixed amount of inputs, and the farm is responsible\nfor input purchase, distribution, and output marketing. The system has demonstrated its initial\nimpacts  in  promoting  farm  workers\u2019  incentive,  and  the  Government  plans  to  transform  all\nremaining cooperative farms into shirkats.7 While farm workers on such farms now have better\nincentives for farm production, they are still under excessive State regulations, particularly by the\nmandatory State procurement for cotton and wheat (paras. 15-17).\n14.  The Government has demonstrated a clear intention to promote private farming. Four laws\npassed in 1998 created a legal basis for private farm operations, including a long-term land lease\npermit to individuals who wish to establish private farms (para. 39). Incentive measures were\nintroduced, including a three-year tax break to newly established private farms. To support the\nsmall private farms, the Government issued a resolution in 1998 to establish a rural business\nadvisory center (RBAC) in every oblast (province) and rayon (district) to provide farm extension\nservices. An association of private farmers was also established with offices at the national,\nprovince, and district levels. Another Government resolution issued in 1999 promoted private\nmachinery services, with a view to addressing the private farms\u2019 lack of access to farm machinery\nservices  and  promoting  market  competition  in  farm  input  supply  and  machinery  services.\nHowever, the low profit in cotton and wheat production and the widespread farm losses, in\nconjunction with the strict State control on trade and foreign currency, discouraged private sector\n                                                \n6  The most critical environmental concern in Uzbek agriculture is not land contamination with chemicals, which has\nbeen mitigated as the application of pesticide has been sharply reduced since 1991. According to the Uzbek National\nEnvironmental Action Plan, the deterioration of the irrigation and drainage systems is the primary cause of land\ndegradation in the country. A large amount of water leakage from the deteriorated irrigation system, in conjunction\nwith poor water use practice, has led to progressive salinity in the soil. Discharges from the drainage system have\nfurther affected fishery in the downstream areas such as Arnasai lake system.\n7  It is reported that about 30-40 percent of all cooperative farms in the Fergana Valley, the richest and most densely\npopulated area, have been restructured into private farms.", "5\nengagement in farm services industries. The RBACs also lacked necessary capacity to provide\nmeaningful business advisory and extension services to private farms.\n15.  Reforms  in  market  liberalization  started  in  the  less  strategic  subsectors  such  as\nvegetables, fruits, and livestock products. The mandatory State procurement (the State order) for\nthese products was abolished, and their prices are now set by market forces. The only agricultural\nproducts that are still subject to the State order are cotton and wheat, where the coverage of the\nState order was reduced from 100 percent to 30 and 25 percent of the production target for cotton\nand wheat, respectively. However, the mandatory requirement to fulfill the production targets\njointly by farms restricted the actual implementation of this policy.8 Since most farms (especially\nthe large cooperative farms) could not fulfil their production targets, they ended up selling 100\npercent of their cotton and wheat to the State at the fixed prices.\n16.  Up to the cropping year 2000, all cotton was procured through Khlopkoprom, a State joint\nstock company which has, throughout the country, processing facilities for cotton including drying,\ncleaning, grading, ginning, certifying, and packing. The processed cotton was sold to foreign\ntraders through local private trading firms registered with the Ministry of External Economic\nRelations. These local private traders handled cotton export and were obliged to surrender all\nforeign exchange earnings to the Government at the official exchange rate.\n17.  Policy  reforms  in  the  cotton  subsector  have  been  particularly  slow.  Cotton  farmers\ncontinued to suffer from excessive State interventions, including the production targets that control\nthe entire production of farms, and the fixed procurement price that, until most recently, was below\nproduction  costs.  The  slow  pace  of  policy  reforms  in  the  cotton  subsector  reflected  the\nGovernment\u2019s deep concern about the potential impacts of cotton liberalization on the country\u2019s\npolitical and social stability, given the large shares of cotton in the country\u2019s export earnings, State\nbudget revenues, and farm income. Such concern was reinforced by the negative results of rapid\npolicy reforms in some neighboring CARs and the financial crisis in the Russian Federation.\nThese countries experienced a severe disruption in agricultural production, sharp rise in rural\npoverty, and a chronic decline in farm income and farmers\u2019 living standards.\n18.  Recognizing the negative social and environmental impact of the widespread farm losses,\nthe Government initiated a new reform package in 1999 to reduce such losses. These reforms,\ninter alia (i) raised the State procurement prices of cotton and wheat by 44 percent, which\n                                                \n8  This policy required farms to first fulfill their production targets, which were, in most cases, set at the high production\nlevels achieved in the 1980s when the irrigation and drainage systems functioned well. The quantity of wheat\nprocured by the State was set at 50 percent of the wheat production target, where (i) the State procurement prices\nwere applied to the first 25 percent of the production target, and (ii) a price premium of 20 percent over and above the\nprocurement prices was paid to the remaining volume purchased by the State. Although farmers were free to sell\nwheat in the domestic markets once they had fulfilled the State procurement volume, there was little left for free\nmarket  sales  because  actual  wheat  production  levels  were  consistently  below  the  high  production  targets.\nConsequently, the quantities of wheat purchased by the State effectively reached 70-95 percent of the actual wheat\nproduction in the Project area. For cotton, there was no price premium. But once the production targets were fulfilled,\nfarmers could receive a financial incentive in the form of additional value derived from cotton by-products, as farmers\nwere given the right to purchase at ex-factory prices the cottonseed oil and seed cake produced out of the cotton\nseeds extracted from 70 percent of the raw cotton produced. In practice, this incentive did not materialize as cotton\nproduction targets were set above actual production levels. Furthermore, a \u201cjoint responsibility\u201d in fulfilling the\nproduction targets by farms was applied to both large cooperative farms and small private farms. The large\ncooperative farms typically had several hundreds to over a thousand farm workers, who were divided into small\nproduction units (brigades). Even if farmers in a brigade fulfilled their production target, they had to sell 100 percent of\ntheir products to the State at the fixed procurement prices without the financial incentive if other brigades on the same\nfarm did not fulfill their production targets. Joint responsibility was later replaced by the family contract system in the\nrestructured cooperative farms (para. 13).", "6\nrepresented an 18 percent real price increase after adjustment for inflation, and brought the\nfarmgate prices of wheat and cotton to their international import and export parity levels valued at\nthe official exchange rate;9 (ii) transferred farmers\u2019 financial burdens for maintaining social and\ncommunal services to the local government budget; (iii) wrote off farm debts to the State, and\nrescheduled farm debts to input suppliers; and (iv) modified the taxation system to a unified land\ntax that effectively represents a tax cut for farms.\n19.  These measures significantly improved the financial status of farms, enabling them to pay\ntheir workers on time and leading to improved producer incentives. The write-off of farm debts\nalso reduced restrictions on farm operations, as without outstanding debts, the tax authority and\nother creditors no longer have access to farms\u2019 banking accounts, and so normal farm operations\nare possible. In conjunction with favorable climatic conditions, cotton production increased by 14\npercent in 1999. By addressing the difficult issue of the widespread farm losses, these reforms\ncontribute to maintaining and increasing the State budget revenues in the long run.10\n20.  Pursuant to policy dialogue with ADB, the Government took a major step to pilot-test policy\nreforms in Ak Altin district by issuing on 2 May 2001 COM Resolution No. 201. The main features\nof  the  resolution  include  (i)  commencing  from  the  cropping  season  2001,  the  annual  state\nproduction target of 50,000 t for wheat and cotton will be replaced by a fixed procurement quota of\n17,000 t for seed cotton and 12,500 t for wheat, (ii) production above the procurement quota can\nbe sold at mutually agreed upon prices, (iii) each agricultural enterprise will be independently\nresponsible for fulfilling its procurement quota, and (iv) a steering committee would monitor\npreparation and implementation of the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project and the impact of\npolicy reforms introduced.\n21.  The issuance of the COM Resolution No. 201 is the first major policy reform for cotton and\nwheat procurement. Considering that the above-quota cotton will be sold to private traders in a\ncompetitive  environment,  the  Government,  taking  into  consideration  the  more  efficient\nmanagement by private traders, has estimated the price of above-quota cotton at 40 percent\nabove the State procurement price.11 These calculations indicate the price the Government may\nhave to offer if it wants to procure the above-quota cotton. The Government, however, has no\nintention of imposing this price or compelling farmers to sell their above-quota cotton to the\nGovernment at this price.\n22.  The  year  2001  cotton  harvest  in  Ak  Altin Rayon  will  be  the  first  to  experience  the\nimplementation of the COM Resolution No. 201. It is likely to take a couple of years to develop\n                                                \n9 Since the official exchange rate is overvalued (footnote 3), these prices are still below their economic values. In\naddition, these include cost of less efficient processing, handling, and transportation by various Government agencies.\n10 These reforms had no significant negative impacts on the State budget. First, the price increases brought the State\ncotton price in the local currency to its international export parity level at the official exchange rate. As the cotton\nmarketing agency received foreign exchange from the entire proceeds of cotton sales to international buyers at\nprevailing international prices and sold foreign currency to the State at the official exchange rate, there is no loss to\nthe State budget. Second, the transfer of the social charges from farms to local government budget had no impact on\nthe State budget, for utilities such as gas and electricity would be passed on to consumers who had benefited from\nfree communal services in the past. Third, the write-off of farm debts represented more of a book transfer than a real\nreduction in State tax revenues, as most farm debts had accumulated as arrears for many years, and could not be\nfeasibly collected. Finally, the Ministry of Finance did not anticipate significant negative impacts on the State budget as\na result of the consolidation of farm taxes into a single land tax, albeit at a reduced level, as the imposition of multiple\ntaxes on the loss-incurring farms had resulted in tax arrears, rather than increased collection of taxes in the past.\nSimplified taxation at a reduced rate is expected to increase the effective tax collection.\n11 These calculations, presented by the Government, use international price of cotton converted at the official rate and\ntaking into consideration the processing, transportation, storage, insurance, other trading costs, and profit margins of\nthe local private firms.", "7\nproper procurement and trading procedures. Although the farmers will be free to sell their above-\nquota production to any legal trading agency, it is envisaged that during the year 2001, the above-\nquota cotton production will continue to be procured by Khlopkoprom, albeit at prices significantly\nabove the State procurement price. As farmers gain confidence and experience, they are likely to\nenter into contracts directly with the local private trading firms (para. 16), paying the service\ncharges to Khlopkoprom for processing. In the long term, particularly if more procurement reforms\nsimilar to those implemented in Ak Altin are undertaken in other parts of the country, more trading\nfirms and processing facilities in the private sector are likely to be established, thereby creating a\nmore competitive environment.\n23.  Despite the achievements mentioned above, deficiencies remain in the policy environment\nin the overall economy and in agriculture. They include (i) State interventions in farm operations,\nespecially the State procurement; (ii) the multiple exchange rate system and the overvalued\nofficial exchange rate that generate significant price distortions; and (iii) lack of market competition\nin farm input supply, machinery services, output processing, and marketing.12\n5.  The Project Area\na.  Geography and Population\n24.  The Project area covers Ak Altin district, located about 120 kilometers (km) from Tashkent\non the Tashkent-Samarkand road in the northwestern part of Syr Darya Province bordering\nKazakhstan. Ak Altin was established in 1971 from five experimental State farms during the\ndevelopment of the Golodnaya Steppe. It has an area of about 57,400 ha, of which about 40,380\nha comprises farmland that includes about 37,000 ha of irrigated crop area. The soils are gray,\nsandy loam with low humus content. The climate is extremely continental, with hot and dry\nsummers and cold winters. Precipitation is low, and 80 percent of the 295-millimeter annual\nrainfall occurs between October and April. As fixed by the State, the cropping pattern in Ak Altin is\ndominated by cotton and wheat, which cover 54 percent and 37 percent, respectively, of the total\nirrigated cropland. The remaining cropland has maize, vegetables, fruits, and alfalfa.\n25.  Ak Altin has a population of close to 50,400, with about 9,640 families living in 14 villages.\nSardoba is the administration center. The district population is young, with 31 percent under age\n14, 61 percent aged 14-55, and only 8 percent over age 55. Population density is about 87\npersons per square kilometer, lower than the provincial average and the over 500 in the Fergana\nValley.\n26.  Women account for about 51 percent of the population. About 6 percent of them are\npensioners and 11 percent have large families with five or more children. Women tend to hold\njobs mostly in health care and education as well as seasonal manual work such as cotton\nweeding and harvesting. Their dominance in these areas results in low wage rates for them, which\non the average are about 80 percent of those of men. As in the rest of the country, women\u2019s\nsociopolitical  status  is  formally  protected.  Basic  education  indicators  show  very  little  gender\ndiscrimination  in  primary  and  secondary  education.13  There  are  women\u2019s  committees  at  the\nnational as well as district levels. Women in the district have equal access to land, irrigation water,\nand credit (in the form of advance payments).\n                                                \n12 There are no specific regulations against private sector participation in farm input supply, machinery services, output\nprocessing, and marketing. The lack of such participation is largely due to the low profitability of cotton and wheat\nproduction (para. 14).\n13 See Uzbekistan: Country Operational Strategy Study, March 2000.", "8\n27.  While there are no official data on poverty in the district, it is estimated that about 1,200 (or\n12 percent) of the 9,640 families need social assistance. This figure is similar to the national\naverage.14 Consultations with local community leaders in Ak Altin showed that most of the poor in\nthe district were farm workers and their families on the large cooperative farms. As these farms\nincurred losses and were unable to pay cash wages regularly, the farm workers suffered from\ndeclining  living  standards.  The  most  vulnerable  groups  were  the  single  mothers,  single\npensioners, disabled persons, and women with a large number of young children. There was a\nsocial safety net with a limited amount of financial assistance from the Government as well as\nformal and informal social organizations that helped their members. However, the farms\u2019 poor\nfinancial status has reduced the local communities\u2019 ability to assist the most needy.\nb.  Rural Institutions and Farming Systems\n28.  The district Hokim (chief) is the head of the local administration. He is appointed by the\nprovincial Hokim, who, in turn, is assigned by the President of the country. As a legacy of a policy\nexperiment in 1995,15 an organization called Agrofirm integrates all farms and services enterprises\nin the district, comprising 12 large cooperative farms, 165 private farms, and all input suppliers,\nprocessing enterprises, and marketing agencies. Agrofirm is responsible for distributing inputs to\nfarms, based on the cotton and wheat procurement contracts.\n29.  A typical cooperative farm in the district has 3,000 ha of irrigated cropland and 700-1,000\npermanent farm workers. These workers are divided into brigades, which are the basic production\nunits. A brigade typically has four workers and 20-30 ha of irrigated land. Farmland belongs to the\nState and is leased by the cooperative farm to the brigades on an annual basis, together with the\ndistribution of procurement quota for cotton and wheat. The cooperative farm provides farm inputs\nand machinery services to the brigades. As part of the nationwide farm restructuring program\n(para. 13), 2 of the 12 large cooperative farms of the district were restructured into private farms,\nwhere the family contract system has replaced joint responsibility in fulfilling the production\ntargets. This new policy has increased farm workers\u2019 incentives and provided a basis for further\npolicy reforms under the Project.\n30.  A private farm is established by separating from a cooperative farm, on recommendation\nfrom the council of the cooperative farm and approval by the district Hokim. A private farm is a\nlegal entity and has a land lease agreement initially for 10 years. Like the cooperative farms,\nprivate farms are subject to the State order system for cotton and wheat procurement and the\nmandatory fulfillment of production targets. A private farm in Ak Altin typically has 35 ha of\nirrigated cropland and 8-12 workers. Private farms are generally not burdened with heavy fixed\ncosts due to their lean management structure, and have flexibility in utilizing seasonal labor to\ncomplement  their  small  workforce.  However,  these  small  farms  lack  timely  access  to  farm\nmachinery services as most of them cannot afford to buy new machinery (para. 32).\n31.  All employees of the cooperative and private farms have their own private household plots.\nWith an average size of 0.35 ha of irrigated cropland, these small land plots are the primary\nsource of fruits, vegetables, and potatoes for family consumption. In the absence of the State\n                                                \n14There is no officially defined poverty line in Uzbekistan. The Government identifies people and families in need of\nsocial assistance by a standard of having an average per capita income of 1.5 times the prevailing minimum monthly\nwage, which was SUM2,450 (or $7.1 at the official exchange rate) in May 2001. Using this criterion, the country had\n14 percent of people or 11 percent of families in need of social assistance in May 1999 (see Uzbekistan: Country\nOperational Strategy Study, March 2000).\n15Ak Altin and two other districts were selected under a resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers in May 1995 for pilot-\ntesting vertical integration of all agricultural activities (farms and their forward and backward linkages).", "9\norder system, private traders are active in the marketing of fruits, vegetables, meat, eggs, and\ndairy products. Wheat is also traded in the free markets, but the volume has been rather small as\nfew farms had surplus wheat left after meeting the heavy State procurement requirements and\nfamily consumption needs.\n32.  Within  the  State  order  system,  farm  inputs  are  provided  at  fixed  prices  based  on\nprocurement contracts between the State Cotton Agency and farms, and are allocated to farms\nthrough Agrofirm (para. 28). Machinery services are provided by the rayon machinery park (RMP)\nas well as by the machinery parks on the 12 large cooperative farms. The RMP is a joint stock\ncompany with 35 percent of shares belonging to the State and 65 percent to the 12 cooperative\nfarms. Recently, the Government purchased some new farm machinery for the RMP: large\nplowing tractors, wheat harvesters, and cotton pickers. The services of the new machinery are\ncharged on a commercial basis. About 90 percent of the RMP\u2019s services are for the cooperative\nfarms and only 10 percent for private farms. Services on the 12 cooperative farms are exclusively\nfor the cooperative farms because the number of farm machinery is insufficient. It is estimated that\nmachinery on most private farms is 10-15 years old and requires frequent and major repairs.\nFurthermore, spare parts of old machinery are not easily available. Insufficient access to timely\nmachinery services has led to frequent delays in farm operations, especially during the peak\nseasons of planting and harvesting; the result is low crop yields and poor product quality. Since\nfarm  inputs  and  machinery  services  are  financed  by  advance  payments  under  the  State\nprocurement system, rural credit plays a minimal role in cotton and wheat production.\n33.  Under the State order system, the district had an unrealistic production target of 50,000 t\neach of raw cotton and wheat, substantially higher than the district's actual production of 27.475 t\nof raw cotton and 31,239 t of wheat in 1999. These production targets were distributed among the\ncooperative and private farms. In 1997, all cooperative farms and half of the private farms failed to\nfulfill their production targets, and all cooperative farms and 28 of 30 private farms incurred losses.\nTotal farm loss amounted to SUM840 million. The farm loss increased to SUM1.13 billion in 1998\nafter a historically low cotton harvest. By the end of 1998, all cooperative farms and over half of\nthe private farms had accumulated debts. In addition to wage arrears, the farm debts included\ndebts to the State budget, pension fund, unemployment fund, water authority, and suppliers of\ninputs (fuel, electricity, fertilizer, chemicals, and seed). The situation improved in 1999; of the 65\nprivate farms only 8 incurred losses. The total farm loss went down to SUM1.092 billion in 1999.\nThe situation is expected to improve further in Ak Altin district with the implementation of the policy\nreforms through COM Resolution No. 201 (para. 20).\nc.  Issues and Constraints\n34.  The widespread farm losses have caused serious social issues, the most important being\nthe declining living standards of the rural majority. During two social surveys conducted in the\nProject area in 1997-1998, 74 percent of the respondents said that their living standards were\nworse and 54 percent, much worse, than five years ago. As few cooperative farms had the ability\nto pay cash wages on time, farm workers had to rely on production from their small household\nplots and irregular payment-in-kind from their cooperative farms. The widespread farm losses\nfurther weakened the local communities\u2019 ability to pay for social services and the cooperative\nfarms\u2019 ability to maintain the communal facilities, which had sharply deteriorated.\n35.  Farm losses have also led to serious environmental concerns, as the losses restricted the\nfarms\u2019 financial ability to pay for O&M of their on-farm irrigation and drainage systems, most of\nwhich had not been maintained properly since the early 1990s. The farms\u2019 poor financial status\nalso  restricted  the  effective  collection  of  water  charges,  providing  little  financial incentive  to", "10\nfarmers to save water. Yet the primary cause of the large amount of water wastage is the poor\nstate of all irrigation distribution facilities, resulting in insufficient water supply to end users as well\nas rising groundwater tables and accelerated soil salinity. Due to poor and deferred maintenance,\nthe drainage system is now in urgent need of rehabilitation. Of the 186 drainage wells, only 12 are\nstill functioning. The water table in about 83 percent of the Project area has risen to within the root\nzone. As a result, average crop yields have declined to about half their level in the 1980s, with\ncotton yield as low as 0.4 t/ha in the most saline areas. Some irrigated lands have been withdrawn\nfrom production due to severe salinity.\n36.  The basic cause underlying the social and environmental problems was the widespread\nfarm losses, which resulted from a number of factors: (i) low output prices for cotton and wheat\nunder the State order system; (ii) high farm operational costs, especially on the large cooperative\nfarms;16 (iii) multiple and high taxes for farms; (iv) low crop yields; and (v) poor product quality and\ngrades that led to significant price discounts at the expense of the farmers. The recent reforms\ninitiated by the Government (para. 18) to some extent redressed these problems. With the write-\noff  of  farm  debts,  transfer  of  the  farms\u2019  social  obligations  to  the  local  government  budget,\nreduction of the tax burden, and a significant increase in cotton and wheat procurement prices,\nthe financial status of farms significantly improved. As the policy environment improved, the\nnumber of private farms in the district increased from 30 in 1998 to 65 in 1999, 102 in 2000, and\n165 in 2001. The implementation of policy reforms (para. 20) is expected to make a significant\npositive impact on the performance of the agriculture sector in Ak Altin.\n37.  Ak Altin farmers will have better prospects of becoming financially sustainable if the\nremaining constraints are addressed in an urgent manner. These constraints include (i) the\nremaining policy restrictions, especially the State procurement for cotton and wheat; (ii) physical\nconstraints, especially the deterioration of the irrigation and drainage systems; and (iii) the lack of\nsupporting system and services including business advice, extension services, and access to farm\nmachinery services. It is estimated that without the rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage\nsystems, crop yields in the district will further decline to 1.0 t/ha for cotton and 1.7 t/ha for wheat\nover the next eight years. No farms will be able to sustain operations with such low crop yields.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n38.  The Government\u2019s current agricultural policies and plans are contained in its Program for\nStrengthening of Economic Reforms in Agriculture during 1998-2000, issued in March 1998 by the\nCOM. The objectives of the Government\u2019s sector development strategy are (i) promoting cotton\nproduction; (ii) achieving grain self-sufficiency; and (iii) ensuring rural employment, enhanced\nliving standards, and social stability.\n39.  The traditional mechanism of Government\u2019s support to cotton and wheat production was\nState budget allocations, including allocations for the irrigation and drainage systems, advance\npayments  to  finance  working  capital  for  cotton  and  wheat  production,  and  administrative\nmeasures to introduce technologies. Without proper producer incentives, these measures had\nonly limited impacts. To promote producer incentives and improve efficiency, the Government\nlaunched a set of reform measures (paras. 12-20). For farm privatization, four laws issued in 1998\n(Land Code, Law on Private Farm, Law on Cooperative Farm, and Law on Dekhan Farm) created\na legal framework for private farming.17 These laws gave permits for long-term land leases to\n                                                \n16 The large cooperative farms typically have high administrative costs, excessive farm labor, and, until most recently\n(para. 18), heavy financial burdens for the maintenance of social and communal infrastructures.\n17 Dekhan farmers (individual farmers) include operators of small (less than 10 ha) private farms and household plot\nusers.", "11\nindividual farmers, providing a legal basis for private farming. In addition, the Government has, for\npilot testing, initiated policy reforms in Ak Altin (para. 20).\n40.  Promoting  agricultural  development  is  a  central  issue  in  the  Government\u2019s  poverty\nreduction and social policy, which focuses on employment generation and social assistance to the\nmost vulnerable groups. Since the majority of the Uzbek population live in the rural area, the\nGovernment emphasizes employment generation in the rural area through development of small\nenterprises. A number of programs were initiated to support the development of small and\nmedium-size enterprises. The Government has shown great interest in microcredit development,\nincluding the creation of rural savings and credit unions.\n41.  In the irrigation and drainage subsector, the concept of water users\u2019 associations (WUAs)\nwas introduced and is supported by the Government. The Government requires farmers to be fully\nresponsible for O&M of their on-farm irrigation and drainage facilities, and repay the full costs of\nthe State investment on rehabilitating on-farm irrigation and drainage systems. For interfarm\nfacilities, the State will continue to be responsible for both investment and O&M expenses.\nAlthough water user fees have been introduced, they do not reflect the real cost of water delivery,\nand their effective collection is limited by the poor financial status of most farms.\n42.  In  May  2001,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture  and  Water  Resources  (MAWR)  prepared  a\nmedium-term (2001-2003) time-bound action plan for economic reforms in agriculture. The plan\nputs  special  emphasis  on  improving  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework,  deepening\nprivatization, improving agricultural financial systems, capacity building, improving irrigation and\ndrainage infrastructure, and relaxing Government restrictions on pricing and state procurement.\nThe action plan is ambitious and is unlikely to be implemented in the timeframe envisaged, but it\npoints the direction in which the Government intends the agriculture sector to go.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n43.  External assistance to agriculture has been modest. So far, a World Bank-funded Cotton\nSubsector Improvement Project, with a loan amount of $66 million approved in May 1995, is the\nsingle largest operation in this sector. The World Bank is preparing its second agricultural project,\nAgriculture Enterprises Restructuring Program (AERP) with an original design to pilot-test a full\nmarket liberalization program in five districts. After encountering difficulties, the World Bank is now\nin the process of redesigning the AERP to support the nationwide farm restructuring program\ninitiated by the Government. The World Bank is also working with the Government in preparing\ntwo projects on water resources.18\n44.  In the agroprocessing subsector, the largest investment is the ADB-financed $50 million\nRural Enterprises Development Project.19 Other external assistance to this sector includes the\nTurkish Exim Bank-financed construction of the Khorezm sugar refinery, with a loan amount of\n$25 million. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has financed several credit\nlines aimed at supporting small and medium-size enterprises.\n45.  The European Union has provided a large number of TA grants through the Technical\nAssistance  for  the  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  program.  Major  activities  of  the\n                                                \n18 These are (i) Karshi Pumping Cascade Rehabilitation Project, and (ii) Amudaria River Basin Drainage Project.\n19Loan 1504-UZB: Rural Enterprises Development Project, for $50 million, approved on 17 December 1996. The Rural\nEnterprises Development Project experienced slow disbursement in its initial years of implementation due to lack of\nqualified subloan borrowers and implementing agencies\u2019 lack of experience, but implementation improved in late\n1999.", "12\nTechnical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States program include (i) sectoral\nsupport to private farmers, (ii) a pilot integrated development project, (iii) training and education for\nfarmers  and  allied  personnel,  (iv)  a  food  and  agriculture  policy  unit,  (v)  water  resources\nmanagement  and  agricultural  production,  (vi)  on-farm  pilot  irrigation  management,  (vii)  land\nregistration, and (viii) crop forecasting by remote sensing.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n46.  The  Project  will  be  the  first  ADB  investment  in  agriculture  through  MAWR.20  ADB\u2019s\nagricultural  operations  in  similar  countries,  especially  the  CARs,  as  well  as  its  operational\nexperience in other sectors in Uzbekistan provided useful lessons to guide the project design and\nimplementation arrangements.\n47.  ADB\u2019s  operational  experience  in  agriculture  in  similar  countries,  especially  CARs,\nhighlighted the critical importance of (i) strong Government ownership of projects and commitment\nto their implementation, (ii) realistic assessment of institutional capacity of the implementing\nagencies,  and  (iii)  close  monitoring  of  project  implementation.  These  lessons  have  been\nincorporated into the project design. A participatory approach was adopted in project preparation.\nGovernment officials in both the central coordination agencies (COM, Ministry of Finance [MOF],\nand Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics) and the Executing Agency (EA), MAWR, actively\nparticipated in developing the project design including its cost estimates. Project implementation\nstaff on both national and local levels also participated in the preparations to foster ownership of\nand  commitment  to  the  Project.  Their  capacity  was  evaluated  during  the  course  of  project\npreparations. Considering MAWR\u2019s lack of project implementation experience, the project design\nemphasizes simplicity and implementability, with adequate resources provided under the Project\nfor institutional development and capacity building. Mechanisms are provided to closely monitor\nproject implementation and its social and environmental impacts (paras. 81-83).\n48.  ADB\u2019s project portfolio in Uzbekistan is relatively young and many EAs do not have\nsufficient implementation experience. The 1999 Country Portfolio Review Mission identified major\nimplementation problems and the Government agreed on various corrective measures including\nearly establishment of the project implementation structure (PIS) and assignment of the PIS staff.\nThe  Mission  also  recommended  ADB\u2019s  close  implementation  supervision  through  various\nmissions; and training for the counterpart staff through advisory TAs, on-the-job training, seminars\non ADB policies and procedures, and training programs for PIS staff. The Country Portfolio\nReview  Mission  conducted  in  June  2000  reported  overall  improvement  of  the  portfolio\nmanagement. It was noted that (i) the Government and EAs had taken steps to enhance the\nefficiency of project implementation, (ii) project implementation units were being maintained with\nqualified staff and staff attrition was minimum, (iii) utmost efforts were being made to improve\ncompliance  with  loan  and  TA  covenants,  (iv)  the  Government  was  making  necessary\narrangements for timely submission of audited financial statements, (v) adequate counterpart\nfunds were allocated, and (vi) the Government and the EA staff had improved their understanding\nof ADB\u2019s policies and procedures.\n49.  For Ak Altin Project, the Government has already established the PIS at both national and\ndistrict levels (paras. 78-79) and assigned key staff. Government counterpart staff worked with the\nADB processing missions in designing the Project and thus familiarized themselves with ADB\noperations. Some of the staff also participated in the training seminar on ADB procedures for\nconsultants selection and procurement. International consulting services will be provided to assist\n                                                \n20The Executing Agency for Rural Enterprises Development Project is the National Bank of Uzbekistan.", "13\nthe project management office (PMO) and project site office (PSO) to establish sound operational\nsystems. The Government has given assurances on timely allocation and release of adequate\ncounterpart funds, and assignment of qualified and experienced staff to the remaining positions in\nthe PMO and PSO.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n50.  ADB\u2019s operations in Uzbekistan have been guided by the country operational strategy\n(COS) prepared in March 2000, which supports the Government\u2019s efforts in transforming the\nplanned system to a market economy. The COS involves providing support for policy reforms,\ninstitutional strengthening, and sector investments that promote growth, improve efficiency, and\nrehabilitate deteriorating infrastructure. The COS emphasizes ADB assistance to three priority\nsectors: agriculture, infrastructure rehabilitation, and education. Agriculture is considered as key to\nthe country\u2019s long-term development and an avenue to address both the environmental and rural\npoverty issues.\n51.  The central goal of the COS is to manage the transition to an economy that relies on\nmarket-based institutions supporting a sustainable reduction in poverty and increase in living\nstandards. The objectives of ADB operations in Uzbekistan include (i) managing the transition\nthrough institutional development, and (ii) fully unlocking the potential for future economic growth.\nTo support rural development, the COS calls for three avenues for ADB assistance to agriculture:\n(i) pilot projects to demonstrate the utility of sector reforms and selected investments, (ii) support\nfor rural finance institutions, and (iii) direct support to agriculture-related private sector activities.\n52.  The COS supports ADB\u2019s new Poverty Reduction Strategy, which specifically reflects\nthree major aspects of poverty, i.e., income poverty, poor living standards, and social exclusion.\nThe COS suggests that ADB assistance to address poverty in Uzbekistan include creating income\nopportunities and sustaining social protection and human development, especially in the rural\nareas.  The  COS  also  calls  for  developing  the  rural  economy  through  pilot  projects,  related\nindustries and services, and rural finance. The Project is fully in line with the COS, as it will\nsupport the transition to a market system, rehabilitate rural infrastructure, and build up rural\ninstitutions.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n53.  Intensive policy dialogue was conducted during project preparation at the highest level of\nthe Government. As a result, important aspects of ADB\u2019s policy recommendations have been\nincorporated into the Government\u2019s reform package: farm debt restructuring, abolishing joint\nresponsibility, promoting producer incentives, and encouraging private farming (paras. 13-18).\nImplementation of policy reforms in Ak Altin (para. 20) is a major focus of the Project.\n54.  The Project will pilot-test reforms in the State procurement system for cotton and wheat,\nreplacing the production targets with fixed procurement quotas. To encourage farmers to invest in\nagriculture, the Government has assured that it will not increase the procurement quotas in the\nfuture even with substantial yield increases, so that farmers can reap the full returns of their\ninvestment  (para.  125  [i]).  These  measures  are  expected  to  substantially  increase  farmers'\nincentives and reduce their procurement burdens. The free market sales of above-quota cotton\nand wheat will bring higher returns to farmers and provide them with strong incentives to increase\nproduction. Higher returns will induce a demand for farm inputs and machinery services on a\ncommercial  basis,  which  will,  in  turn,  promote  private  sector  participation  in  these  services\nindustries and promote the growth of free markets.", "14\n55.  The  Project  will  open  a  window  for  ADB  to  continue  its  policy  dialogue  with  the\nGovernment, actively participate in the agriculture sector reforms, monitor the reform process, and\nprovide policy advice on a continued basis. Future policy dialogue will focus on (i) deepening\nprivate sector participation in cotton procurement, processing, and trade after the exchange rate\nunification (para. 5); (ii) promotion of market competition in farm input supply, machinery services,\noutput processing, and marketing, especially when farm profit increases and private companies\nare interested in providing these services; and (iii) farm restructuring and privatization, especially\nwhen farming profit increases under the Project and an increasing number of farm workers want\nto separate from the large cooperative farms. Specific assurances have been obtained from the\nGovernment to periodically review (i) the cotton and wheat procurement policy to foster and\ndevelop market competition and participation of the private sector; and (ii) the cotton and wheat\nprocurement  prices  to  ensure  that  future  price  revisions  fully  reflect  adjustments  for  annual\ninflation and changes in international border prices, and also reflect changes in the exchange\nrates (para. 125 [iii \u2013 v]).\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n56.  The continued decline in cotton production in Uzbekistan in recent years has seriously\naffected the country\u2019s balance of payments and brought financial difficulties to the Government. At\nthe micro level, the declining cotton yield has resulted in widespread farm losses, leading to falling\nliving standards and deteriorating social services for the rural majority. Serious environmental\nconcerns have also arisen as the poor financial status of farms restricted their ability to pay for the\nO&M of their irrigation and drainage systems. Lack of maintenance has led to deterioration of the\nirrigation systems, rising groundwater, and accelerated soil salinity. The waste of water resources\nand  degradation  of  farmland,  in  addition  to  short-term  losses,  are  constraining  agricultural\ndevelopment in the country.\n57.  To  reduce  farm  losses,  the  Government  initiated  a  reform  package  to  increase\nprocurement prices, reduce farm taxes and social charges, and write off farm debts (para. 18).\nThe  positive  impacts  of  these  reforms  cannot  be  sustained  unless  the  remaining  sector\nconstraints  are  also  addressed  in  an  urgent  manner.  The  Project\u2014by  modifying  the  State\nprocurement  system  to  reduce  farmers\u2019  financial  burdens  and  promote  producer  incentives,\nrehabilitating  the  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  to  restore  crop  productivity,  and  providing\ninstitutional support to sustain the O&M of the systems after rehabilitation\u2014will complement the\nGovernment\u2019s reform efforts. The Government has also launched the nationwide program of farm\nrestructuring with the intention of promoting private farming (paras. 13-14). However, low farm\nprofits have discouraged private farming and restricted the effectiveness of the Government\nefforts. By doubling crop productivity, the Project will increase farming profit and thus encourage\nprivate sector participation in farming and farm services industries (paras. 14 and 22). The\nGovernment has agreed to pilot-test further policy reforms on market liberalization under the\nProject and has substantially (66-75 percent) reduced the mandatory State procurement of cotton\nand wheat (para. 20). The proposed reform on reducing State interventions and farmers\u2019 financial\nburdens has obtained strong support from farmers in the Project area. The Project\u2019s development\nimpacts will be maximized when its pilot experiences, if successful, are replicated nationwide.\n58.  The Project will strengthen the sector reforms initiated by the Government and enable\nADB to remain engaged in policy dialogue to promote market-oriented agriculture. The Project\nadopts a realistic approach that focuses on increasing crop productivity despite the remaining\npolicy constraints. As crop yields are expected to double in eight years after the rehabilitation of", "15\nthe  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  farm  income  and  farmers\u2019  living  standards  will  rise\nsubstantially in the Project area. Improved farm profits will encourage private sector participation\nand market development. The rising cotton production will promote export earnings, improve the\ncountry\u2019s balance of payments position, release pressure on the foreign currency reserve and\nState control on foreign currency, and thus provide a better environment for macroeconomic\nreforms. The substantial gains in crop productivity under the Project will demonstrate tangible\nbenefits to convince policy makers and generate public support for further policy reforms.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n59.  The Project goal is to promote agricultural development on a sustainable basis. The\nprimary objective is to improve agricultural performance and increase farm incomes in Ak Altin\ndistrict, with focus on cotton and wheat production. The secondary objective is to protect and\nenhance the environment by improving water management practices and land quality. Successful\nproject interventions are expected to be replicated nationwide.\n60.  The  Project  will  comprise  four  components:  (i)  institutional  support,  monitoring,  and\nevaluation; (ii) rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems; (iii) farm machinery services;\nand (iv) project management.\n1.  Institutional Support, Monitoring, and Evaluation\n61.  The Project will strengthen the rural institutions to support agriculture sector reforms in Ak\nAltin, focusing on the newly established RBAC that will play a key role in facilitating the ongoing\nfarm restructuring, supporting private farming, and organizing and training WUAs. Support will be\nprovided for (i) strengthening RBAC, (ii) organizing and training WUAs, (iii) establishing pilot\ndemonstration farms, and (iv) establishing a monitoring and evaluation unit (MEU).\na.  Strengthening the Rural Business Advisory Center\n62.  The RBAC in Ak Altin was established in October 1998 to facilitate farm restructuring and\nprovide extension services to farmers. However, RBAC lacks the necessary capacity to fulfill its\nresponsibilities.  The  Project  will  strengthen  RBAC  by  providing  equipment,  establishing\noperational systems, and strengthening its staff. RBAC will have nine full-time staff comprising\ndomestic experts specializing in agribusiness, farm management, finance, law, business planning,\ntraining  and  administration,  agricultural  engineering,  agronomy,  and  entomology.  A  team  of\ninternational and domestic consultants will be financed under an associated TA to assist in\nstrengthening  RBAC.  The  consultants  will  help  RBAC  develop  its  operational  strategy  and\nmanagement systems, prepare training materials, and strengthen its staff through training courses\nand hands-on training. Currently, RBAC is self-financing through user fees from farms. It is\nexpected that, with the establishment of sound operational systems, development of training\nmaterials, and strengthening of staff capacity, RBAC will be able to independently provide all\ntraining, and business advisory and farm extension services required by the Ak Altin farmers after\nthe Project is completed. Its operations will be sustained through user fees from its farmer clients.\n63.  To strengthen RBAC\u2019s capacity in farm extension services, the Project will finance the\ndevelopment of a program for integrated pest management (IPM).21 Local agronomists in RBAC\nwill be trained in IPM and, in turn, will conduct training courses for farmers. Improved seed\n                                                \n21 IPM is a pest control approach that utilizes regular monitoring to determine if and when treatments are needed and\nemploys physical, mechanical, cultural, biological, and educational methods to keep pest numbers low. Least-toxic\nchemicals are used as the last resort in pest control.", "16\nvarieties, new technologies, rational use of inputs especially agrochemicals, and better agronomic\npractices that fit the conditions of the project area will be studied and introduced as appropriate.\nThe Project will finance the preparation of training materials and conduct of training courses for\nboth trainers and the farmers.\nb.  Organizing and Training Water Users\u2019 Associations\n64.  The dynamics of farm restructuring implies continued changes in farm organizations in the\nProject area. The number of small private farms is likely to rise sharply as farm profits increase.\nConsequently, the existing water allocation and O&M systems will need change as many on-farm\nsystems will become interfarm facilities. To facilitate the transition, the Project will assist in the\nestablishment of WUAs. Currently, no laws or regulations in Uzbekistan specifically relate to\nWUAs. However, there is also no legal impediment to the establishment of a WUA. The only legal\nrequirement  is  that  a  WUA  be  registered  as  a  legal  entity  with  the  local  government.  The\nGovernment has agreed to take necessary actions to ensure that WUAs can perform their\nfunctions: organizing and training water users, signing contracts for water allocation and O&M\nservices, collecting from members user fees for O&M activities, introducing water management\nmeasures, and assuming responsibility for O&M of their irrigation and drainage systems (para.\n125[vi]).  The  legal  department  of  MWAR  will  assist  in  preparing  model  WUA  articles  of\nassociation, in consultation with the legal consultant under the associated TA.\n65.  WUAs will be organized on the basis of canal command areas in Ak Altin. The Project will\nstrengthen  WUAs  to  take  charge  of  water  allocation,  user  fee  collection  for  O&M,  water\nmanagement, and O&M activities. TA consultants and RBAC will facilitate WUA establishment. An\ninformation campaign at the start of the Project will raise farmers\u2019 awareness of the need for\nWUAs and their functions. WUA staff will undergo training in the preparation of business plans,\nfinancial  management,  bookkeeping,  and  procurement  of  goods  and  services  necessary  for\nmaintaining the water management systems. WUAs will be responsible for O&M of on-farm\nsystems in the near term, and eventually be capable of taking responsibility for O&M of the\ninterfarm irrigation water supply and drainage systems.\nc.  Pilot Demonstration Farms\n66.  To facilitate the dissemination of new technologies and to maximize project impacts, a\nnumber of demonstration farms with a total area of about 200 ha will be established in Ak Altin.\nThese  farms  will  demonstrate  the  impacts  of  improved  seed  varieties,  optimal  use  of\nagrochemicals, on-farm water and land management practices and techniques, IPM, and other\nnew technologies suitable for the district. The Project will enter into agreement with interested\nfarms to use their lands for the demonstration purpose, setting forth the rights and responsibilities\nof the Government and the participating farmers. The Project will finance civil works, seeds, and\nagrochemicals;  the  farms  will  provide  labor,  water,  and  machinery  inputs.  An  information\ncampaign and field visits by farmers will disseminate the results of the demonstration farms. The\ndemonstration farms are expected to play a key role in promoting new technologies and contribute\nto the improvement of product quality and productivity in the Project area. The farms will be\nselected pursuant to the criteria agreed upon between the Government and ADB.\nd.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n67.  An MEU will be established to monitor the environmental and social impacts of the Project.\nThe MEU will have two full-time staff specializing in environment and sociology, and will be\nresponsible for (i) preparing and analyzing baseline economic, social, environmental, and health", "17\nconditions  in  the  Project  area;  (ii)  benefit  monitoring  during  project  implementation;  and  (iii)\nevaluating the Project\u2019s economic, social, and environmental impacts including health conditions\nin the Project area. The MEU will work with the monitoring and evaluation specialist of PMO to\ndevelop  and  maintain  a  system  for  measuring  the  Project\u2019s  outputs  and  impacts.  For\nenvironmental monitoring, the local office of the Hydrologic Amelioration Expedition (HAE) and the\nprovincial office of the State Committee for Nature Protection will collect and analyze data on the\nquality of irrigation and drainage water, soil chemistry, and groundwater depth and quality. The\nlaboratories of HAE and State Committee for Nature Protection will be equipped to ensure\neffective and regular environmental monitoring with specific reference to the quality of irrigation,\ndrainage, and municipal water supply. Benchmark data will be collected to serve as baseline\ninformation to compare with data collected during and after project implementation. Environmental\nmonitoring will include a comparative analysis of water and soil samples outside the project area\nto measure the specific positive environmental impacts generated by the Project.\n68.  To monitor social impact, the MEU will (i) collect and analyze benchmark information on\neconomic and social conditions, and public health; (ii) assess project benefits during project\nimplementation; and (iii) evaluate benefits at project completion. The participation of women in\nvarious project activities will also be monitored. A socioeconomic profile of the beneficiaries\u2014\nbased on gender-disaggregated data on different social groups\u2014will be prepared at the start of\nproject implementation. The social profile will be updated at project completion, and a report will\ndescribe the project benefits and impacts on public health and farmers\u2019 living standards.\n2.  Rehabilitation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems\n69.  The Project will finance the rehabilitation of on-farm and interfarm facilities, including the\nrestoration  of  the  proper  functions  of  the  primary  open  collector  and  secondary  subsurface\ndrainage systems. Components of the irrigation system will be repaired or rebuilt as appropriate.\nNew water control and measurement structures will be built to allow proper control of the irrigation\nsupplies to both small and large water users. The Project will finance the costs of rehabilitating\nand improving all irrigation and drainage facilities, including the costs of surveys, investigations,\ndesign preparation, as well as consulting services for design, review, construction supervision,\nand other associated costs. The costs of on-farm improvements will be recovered from the\nbeneficiaries.\n70.  On-farm  improvement  works  to  be  financed  under  the  Project  will  cover  irrigation,\ndrainage, and land management. The drainage infrastructure will include deepening of about 383\nkm of field and farm drains, cleaning and flushing of about 424 km of horizontal field drains,\nproviding about 340 km of horizontal subsurface field drains in the vertical drainage area, and\ninstalling about 415 km of new horizontal field drains. The irrigation infrastructure works will\ninclude rehabilitating about 42 km of concrete canals with bed width of 0.5 meter, 383 flume\ndistribution structures, 255 flume check structures, 255 end-flume transitions; reconstructing about\n240 km flumes of various sizes; and realigning about 128 km flumes of various sizes. The land\nmanagement works will include tertiary field-level distribution systems (pipe or canals) as well as\nland leveling operations, deep plowing, and remedial subsoiling to break up plow pans; and\naddition of suitable soil amendments and land leveling to make salt leaching more effective.\n71.  The detailed design of on-farm rehabilitation work will be based on the results of close\nconsultations with farmer beneficiaries. The Project staff and consultants will present design\nalternatives to farmer beneficiaries, explain to them the associated costs and other features of\neach alternative, and assist them in selecting the most appropriate design. Before the start of on-", "18\nfarm rehabilitation works, farmers will enter into agreement with the Government implementation\nagency, indicating their approval of the works and readiness to repay the investment costs.\n72.  Interfarm works will include (i) drainage works, comprising deepening and rehabilitation of\n75 km of interfarm collectors; and (ii) irrigation works, including rehabilitation of 10 km of concrete\ncanals and associated structures.\n73.  To ensure proper O&M of the rehabilitated irrigation and drainage systems, the Project will\nfinance the procurement of maintenance, monitoring, transport, and logistical equipment. The\nmaintenance equipment will be used for the upkeep of the irrigation and drainage facilities, farm\nroads, and for land leveling of the irrigated fields. The Project will also provide for monitoring\nequipment for the provincial laboratories of HAE and State Committee for Nature Protection that\nwill regularly monitor the quality of irrigation, drainage, and municipal water supply and of soil. The\nO&M equipment procured under the Project will be operated and maintained by the Rayon\nAgriculture and Water Department (RAWD), which will charge the respective farms for O&M\nservices for on-farm facilities.\n3.  Farm Machinery Services\n74.  To address the key constraint of private farms\u2019 lack of timely access to farm machinery\nservices, the Project will provide a set of farm machinery, together with the required civil works,\nworkshop facilities for maintenance and repair, office equipment, and training. The machinery will\nbe operated and maintained by a newly established commercial entity (the RAWD Unit) under the\nRAWD. MOF and the RAWD Unit will enter into a subsidiary loan agreement for the loan amount\nto be allocated for machinery purchase (para. 77). RAWD currently operates and maintains the\nO&M equipment for the irrigation and drainage systems in the district and has the necessary\nfacilities and experience for such activities. The RAWD Unit will provide farm machinery services\nto private farms and collect service charges from them. The charges will be determined on a\ncommercial basis, which is the current practice in the district (para. 32). The RAWD Unit will use\nthese charges to meet O&M costs for the equipment and to repay the subsidiary loan.\n4.  Project Management\n75.  The Project will provide staff complement and necessary vehicles, equipment, and office\nfurniture for a PMO in Tashkent and a PSO in Ak Altin. The Project will finance two international\nconsultants (a project management adviser and a procurement specialist) to assist PMO and PSO\nto  establish  their  operational  systems  comprising  a  sound  accounting,  internal  control,  and\nauditing system as well as effective monitoring mechanisms. The consultants will also provide\nhands-on  training  to  PMO  and  PSO  staff,  especially  during  the  early  stages  of  project\nimplementation. PMO and PSO staff will be trained on project management, coordination of\nproject activities, preparation and review of procurement documents, and other implementation\nmatters.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n76.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $72.0 million equivalent, comprising $38.7\nmillion  in  foreign  exchange  costs  and  $33.3  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The\nestimates include provision for $6.4 million in taxes and duties, 6.2 percent of base costs for\nphysical contingencies, and 7.7 percent for price contingencies.

Financing Plan\n77.  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $36.0 million from its ordinary capital resources\nwith an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and with interest\ncalculated in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans,\na commitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a front-end fee of 1.0 percent of the loan amount. The\nBorrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. ADB financing will be about 50 percent22 of the total\nproject cost, and will cover about 91 percent of the foreign exchange costs including the front-end\nfee, interest, and other charges during construction, and $0.8 million equivalent of the local\ncurrency costs.23 The beneficiaries will contribute about $2.0 million toward project costs in the\nform of O&M costs of the on-farm facilities during project implementation. The remaining $34.0\nmillion equivalent will be provided by the Government and includes $3.5 million for indirect foreign\nexchange  expenditures.  For  the  component  for  farm  machinery  services,  a  subsidiary  loan\nagreement in the amount of $5.3 million will be entered into between MOF, on behalf of the\nBorrower,  and  the  RAWD  Unit.24  Execution  and  delivery  of  a  subsidiary  loan  agreement\n                                                \n22 The Project was prepared substantially during 1999 and 2000, envisioning complete processing by 2000. Therefore,\nit is proposed that the cost-sharing limit applicable to the Republic of Uzbekistan in year 2000, i.e., 50 percent, be\napplied to this project.\n23 The local cost financing is primarily for promoting critical capacity building initiatives associated with (i) the\nestablishment  of  demonstration  farms,  (ii)  provision  of  rural  business  advisory  services  and  training,  (iii)\nestablishment of alternative farm machinery services, (iv) recruitment of key domestic consultants as counterparts to\ninternational consultants, and (v) strengthening of project management and administration. In total, the local cost\nfinancing amounts to less than 2.2 percent of the total ADB financing of $36 million.\n24 The terms of subsidiary loan agreement shall not be softer than those of the ADB\u2019s loan to the Government.", "20\nacceptable to ADB will be a condition for effectiveness of the Loan Agreement.

Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Organization and Coordination\n78.  MAWR will be the EA of the Project. A deputy minister of MAWR has been appointed as\nthe project director to oversee project implementation. The Rural Restructuring Agency (RRA)\nunder MAWR has been made responsible for project implementation.25 On behalf of MAWR, the\ndirector general of RRA will have the authority to undertake financial transactions, sign contracts,\nand endorse financial statements. The director general will be assisted by a senior financial\nadviser and a senior project management adviser on all financial and procurement matters.\n79.  A  project  steering  committee  (PSC)  has  been  established  in  accordance  with  COM\nResolution No. 201 to strengthen the coordination of all matters related to the Project. The PSC is\nchaired by the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics\n(MMS),  and  comprises  representatives  from  COM,  MAWR,  MOF,  MMS,  State  Property\nCommittee, State Tax Committee, State Committee for Land Resources, Cotton Bank, and RRA.\nAn interministerial working group (WG) was also established, with staff from COM, MOF, MMS,\nMAWR, RRA, and the Hokim of Ak Altin district. While the PSC comprises high-ranking officials\nand is responsible for policy making, the WG comprises working-level Government staff and is\nresponsible  for  identifying  issues  that  need  interagency  coordination,  investigating  factors\nunderlying the issues, and proposing solutions to the PSC. The WG worked closely with ADB\nmissions on the project design. To ensure smooth implementation, the PSC and WG will continue\nto function during project implementation to handle issues that need interministerial coordination.\nThe PSC will meet quarterly to review implementation progress, identify issues, and determine\nmeasures to address the issues.\n80.  The  PMO,  established  within  RRA,  is  headed  by  a  full-time  manager,  who  will  be\nresponsible  for  the  day-to-day  tasks  relating  to  implementation.  The  PMO  manager  will  be\nassisted by two accountants, a financial specialist, a procurement specialist, an irrigation/drainage\nengineer,  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist,  and  support  staff  including  administrative\nassistants, translators/interpreters, and secretaries.\n                                                \n25 RRA was established in accordance with the COM Resolution No. 356 dated 19 August 1998 to facilitate the\npreparation of the World Bank-financed AERP and the ADB\u2019s Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project.", "21\n81.  A PSO was established in Ak Altin to take charge of the day-to-day activities at the field\nlevel. The PSO is headed by a site manager who will be supported by an accountant, two\nirrigation/drainage engineers, a farm mechanization specialist, and an agronomist. The MEU\n(para. 67) will be established to monitor project implementation, benefits, as well as social and\nenvironmental impacts.\n82.  A team of international and domestic consultants will assist the PMO and the PSO to set\nup their operational systems and manage project implementation. The Government and ADB will\njointly  conduct  annual  reviews  of  project  implementation,  including  project  organization  and\nstaffing arrangements. Necessary adjustments will be made on the basis of the implementation\nexperience (para. 98).\n83.  A rayon consultative committee (RCC) will be established in Ak Altin during the first year of\nimplementation to ensure active beneficiary participation in project activities. RCC will be chaired\nby an elected representative of the project beneficiaries, and comprise other representatives from\nprivate  farms,  cooperative  farms,  farm  brigade  leaders,  farm  workers,  family  contractors,\ncommunity leaders, WUAs, women representatives, and the district administration. PSO will\nsubmit to RCC quarterly reports on the progress of project implementation. RCC will (i) represent\nthe project beneficiaries to monitor project implementation and its impacts; (ii) provide a forum for\naddressing  beneficiaries\u2019  concerns  and  discuss  district-level  issues  that  arise  during\nimplementation;  and  (iii)  provide  inputs  and  recommendations  for  PMO,  PSO,  and  district\nadministration to take corrective and mitigating measures to improve implementation. Appendix 3\nillustrates the relationship of the various organizations involved in project implementation.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n84.  The Project will be implemented over five years starting in the fourth quarter of year 2001\n(Appendix 4). Project activities during the first year will concentrate on the fielding of consultants,\nprocurement and installation of equipment, development of operational systems for PMO and\nPSO, and training of their staff. For ease in implementation scheduling, the Project area will be\ndivided  into  three  phases  with  due  consideration  to  hydrologic  boundaries.  The  civil  works\ncomponent will be implemented in three overlapping packages, each taking two calendar years,\nwith package 1 starting in year 2 and package 3 finishing at the end of year 5. The packages will\nbe  designed  to  ensure  that  on-farm,  interfarm,  and  commissioned  drainage  facilities  are\ncompleted within each major hydrologic supply and drainage unit in a staged fashion. To address\nan urgent concern of the project beneficiaries, the rehabilitation schedule will give high priority to\nthe drainage systems in the settlement area by including them in package 1. Field surveys,\ninvestigations,  and  preparation  of  detailed  designs  of  the  civil  works  of  package  1  will  be\nconducted in year 1. Establishment of WUAs and their training will be initiated in year 1, with the\nbulk of the activities conducted in years 2 and 3.\n3.  Consultation with Project Beneficiaries on Cost Recovery\n85.  In  accordance  with  the  Government  policy,  on-farm  investment  costs  will  be  fully\nrecovered from the project beneficiaries over a period of 25 years including a grace period of 5\nyears pursuant to the cost recovery agreements.26 Full cost recovery will provide farmers with a\nstrong incentive to participate in monitoring the design and implementation of the rehabilitation of\ntheir  on-farm  irrigation  and  drainage  systems,  as  well  as  O&M  activities  after  rehabilitation.\n                                                \n26 The beneficiaries will be charged for only those improvements that will be implemented on their farms, except for the\ndrainage wells, which may not necessarily be located on their land.", "22\nFarmers will have the option to join the Project. Those who join will be consulted on their choice of\nalternate plans for the rehabilitation. Rehabilitation work on a specific farm will start only after the\nfarmers approve the investment plan and sign the cost-recovery agreement (para. 71).\n86.  Farmers\u2019 ability to fully repay the investment and finance the O&M costs was confirmed by\nthe  results  of  farm  budget  model  simulations.  Using  data  verified  with  MAWR,  the  local\nadministration, and farmers, the results of the model simulations show that, as cotton yields will\ndouble in eight years with the rehabilitation, the Project will generate high financial returns and a\nhealthy cash flow for both cooperative and private farms. The farmers will have the ability to\nfinance the O&M costs starting from year 4 and repay the full investment costs starting from\nyear 6.\n87.  Various  farmer  groups  were  consulted  on  the  cost  recovery  issue  during  project\npreparation.  Anticipated  project  benefits  and  associated  investment  and  O&M  costs  were\npresented to the representative farm beneficiaries. The beneficiaries, representing both the large\ncooperative farms and the small private farmers, unanimously supported the Project and its\ndesign, and agreed to fully repay the on-farm investment and finance all O&M costs of the on-farm\nfacilities. To further increase farmers\u2019 awareness of their rights, choices, and responsibilities in the\nProject and cost recovery, an information campaign will be launched at the start of project\nimplementation,  with  assistance  from  RBAC  and  the  project  consultants,  and  with  active\nparticipation of RCC.\n4.  Operation and Maintenance of the Irrigation and Drainage Systems\n88.  The O&M arrangements as well as support for WUA establishment and training are\ndesigned to develop institutional capacity to facilitate the smooth transfer of O&M responsibilities\nto the project beneficiaries, with a view to sustaining the project benefits. As at present, O&M of\non-farm irrigation facilities and drainage collectors will continue to be the responsibility of the\nrespective farms and/or individual water users. O&M of the drainage wells will ultimately be\nhandled by WUAs after they develop sufficient capabilities and experience. O&M of interfarm\ncanals  and  drainage  collectors,  presently  the  responsibility  of  RAWD,  will  be  handed  over\nultimately to WUAs.\n89.  During  the  transition  period  \u2013  before  all  O&M  activities  are  handed  over  to  the\nbeneficiaries  \u2013  suitable  arrangements  will  be  made  to  ensure  proper  O&M  of  the  facilities\nconstructed/improved under the Project. During the project period, O&M of the wells and interfarm\nirrigation and drainage systems will be the responsibility of RAWD, which will undertake these\nactivities through its staff or will contract them out to private enterprises. To sustain its operation,\nRAWD will collect service charges for the drainage wells. It will divide the amount of actual power\nbills over the effective drainage area, and collect payments from farmers on a per hectare basis. It\nwill also take charge of the O&M of the farm machinery purchased under the Project. The\ncommercial charges from the farm machinery services will sustain the RAWD Unit\u2019s operations.\n5.  Procurement\n90.  Machinery, equipment, civil works, and services for rehabilitating irrigation and drainage,\nas well as vehicles, office equipment, and materials required for project implementation and\nmonitoring will be procured following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. An equipment and\nmaterial procurement contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be\nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding (ICB). Contracts costing less than\n$500,000 will be on the basis of international shopping procedures acceptable to ADB. Small", "23\nsupply contracts costing less than $100,000 will be procured through direct purchase. The award\nof all equipment contracts will be subject to approval by ADB.\n91.  Each civil works contract estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or more will be\nawarded on the basis of ICB among prequalified contractors as described in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement. Civil works packages costing less than $500,000 will be carried out on the basis of\nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. MAWR will supervise all procurement.\nThe award of all civil works contracts will be subject to approval by ADB. A list of equipment and\nmaterials to be procured is in Appendix 5, and a tentative packaging of major procurement and\ncivil works is given in Appendix 6.\n6.  Consulting Services\n92.  The Project will provide for 65 person-months of international consultants and 198 person-\nmonths of domestic consultants. The consultants will assist MAWR in (i) monitoring, evaluating,\nand designing pilot farms; (ii) carrying out surveys and investigations, preparing and reviewing\ndesigns, and supervising construction of on-farm and interfarm irrigation and drainage facilities;\nand (iii) project administration. The consulting services will be provided by international consulting\nfirms in association with domestic consulting firms to be engaged by MAWR in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the\nengagement of the domestic consultants. An outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in\nAppendix 7.\n93.  The input of international consultants will be limited to the initial years during which they\nwill  provide  hands-on  training  to  PMO/PSO  staff,  who  will  then  carry  out  project  activities\nindependently later in the implementation period. To maximize the impacts of the consulting\nservices, the schedule of the consultants\u2019 field services will be flexible, with appropriate breaks to\nincrease the total period covered.\n7.  Advance Procurement Action\n94.  To  expedite  project  implementation,  ADB  has  approved  advance  action  on  the\nprocurement of civil works, construction materials and equipment, as well as recruitment of\nconsultants. The Government has been informed that (i) advance action will cover actions up to,\nbut not including, contract signing; and (ii) approval of advance action does not commit ADB to\nfinance the Project.\n8.  Disbursement, Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n95.  After loan effectiveness, an imprest account will be established at the Central Bank of\nUzbekistan, or a bank acceptable to ADB, to facilitate the timely release of loan funds for the\npurpose  of  making  payments  in  local  currency  under  the  Project.  During  the  first  year  of\nimplementation, the ceiling of the imprest account will be set at $100,000. Thereafter, and once\nMAWR has established an adequate accounting system and internal control procedures for the\nProject, the ceiling for the imprest account will be based on an estimate of expenditures to be\nincurred during the following 12 months of implementation. In any case, the ceiling for the imprest\naccount will not exceed $500,000. The imprest account will be established in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook and other procedures to be agreed upon by ADB and the\nGovernment. The use of ADB\u2019s statement of expenditure procedures will be considered after the", "24\nfirst year of project implementation, assuming the establishment of MAWR's separate accounting\nsystem and internal control procedures for the Project.\n96.  MAWR will keep separate accounts and financial statements for the Project (including\nseparate accounts and financial statements for RAWD and RAWD Unit), which will be audited\nannually by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. Loan proceeds will be used for engaging\ninternational auditors acceptable to ADB. Certified copies of the audited financial statements will\nbe submitted to ADB within six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n97.  MAWR, through PMO, will submit quarterly and annual reports to ADB. The reports will\nindicate progress made and problems encountered during the period under review, steps taken to\nremedy  the  problems,  proposed  program  of  activities,  and  expected  progress  during  the\nremaining implementation period. MAWR will also provide other reports and information relating to\nthe Project as ADB may reasonably request, including the Project\u2019s environmental impacts,\ndialogue with beneficiaries, and any social issues relating to the Project. Within three months after\nphysical completion of the Project, MAWR will submit to ADB a project completion report detailing,\namong others, information on project implementation, use of the loan proceeds, and the extent to\nwhich the objectives of the Project have been accomplished.\n9.  Midterm Review\n98.  The Government and ADB will jointly carry out a midterm review at the beginning of year 3\nof project implementation. The midterm review will assess, among others, Project implementation\nstatus, including (i) design and construction standards, (ii) physical progress and disbursements in\nrelation  to  the  implementation  schedule,  (iii)  performance  of  the  Project  consultants  and\ncontractors, and (iv) status of compliance with the assurances stipulated in the Loan Agreement.\nThe midterm review will also assess project impacts including (i) the project\u2019s environmental and\nsocial impacts, (ii) the effects of the procurement system on cotton and wheat yields, farm\nproductivity, market competition and participation of the private sector, and (iii) the feasibility of\nreplicating Project achievements nationwide.\nF.  The Executing Agency\n99.  MAWR, the EA for the Project, was created by merging the former ministries of agriculture\nand water resources. Its primary responsibility is to implement and monitor agricultural policies.\nMAWR is responsible for coordinating State procurement of cotton and grain, including input\ndelivery, machinery services, financing of cotton production, output processing, and marketing.\nMAWR is also responsible for ensuring irrigation water supply, which involves civil works as well\nas maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems. MAWR has equipment depots and staff in\nevery district and coordinates with more than 20 Government institutions on various agriculture\nsector issues.\n100.  MAWR has so far not been involved in implementing ADB-financed projects. However, it\nhas been implementing a World Bank-financed Cotton Subsector Improvement Project and is\ninvolved in preparing the proposed AERP to be financed by the World Bank (para. 43). As\npreparation  of  the  AERP  has  been  slower  than  anticipated,  the  Government  is  considering\nmeasures to strengthen MAWR\u2019s implementation capacity for this Project by appointing qualified\nand experienced staff to lead the project implementation offices.", "25\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n101.  The  Project  has  been  classified  as  environmental  category  B.  Accordingly,  an  initial\nenvironmental examination (IEE) was conducted under the project preparatory TA. The IEE\nconcluded that the Project will have no major adverse environmental impacts since most of the\ncomponents  comprise  rehabilitation  works.  A  full  environmental  impact  assessment  was,\ntherefore, not required. However, MAWR will need to comply with all applicable environmental\nrequirements in accordance with the Government\u2019s regulations to obtain necessary environmental\nclearances  prior  to  construction,  and  to  undertake  environmental  monitoring  throughout  the\nimplementation period, and with ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\n102.  For environmental protection and improvement as well as resources conservation, the\nProject provides for (i) lowering of the water table and reclamation of saline lands, (ii) adoption of\nIPM techniques and training of local agronomists in alternate pest control methods and rational\nuse of fertilizers, (iii) improvement of the environmental monitoring capacity through provision of\nappropriate equipment, and (iv) improvement of irrigation and drainage facilities and adoption of\nimproved water management practices. These measures will have positive environmental impacts\nin the area.\n2.  Social Analysis\n103.  The overriding social issues in the Project area are the declining living standards of the\nrural majority, deteriorating social services, and flooding in the settlement areas during the winter\nand spring seasons. The major factors underlying these social issues are the falling crop yields,\ndeclining farm income, and widespread farm losses caused by the deteriorating irrigation and\ndrainage systems. Social services have deteriorated because the local communities are unable to\npay for the services, and the farms responsible for O&M of social facilities are themselves\nstrapped for cash. With the rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems under the Project,\nfarmers will benefit from increased crop yields and farm incomes, and their living standards will\nimprove accordingly. While the Project has no specific components on social services, it is\nexpected that the increased farm income and the communities\u2019 strengthened financial status will\nenable the farmers to pay for social services and the situation will improve significantly. To\nalleviate the flooding problem in the settlements, the Project will give priority to rehabilitation of the\ndrainage systems in the settlement areas (para. 84).\n104.  Intensive consultations with farmer beneficiaries were conducted at every step of project\npreparation.  All  farmers  interviewed  expressed  their  strong  support  and  keen  interest  in\nparticipating in the Project. Recognizing their responsibility in repaying the full investment costs for\non-farm  rehabilitation,  farmers  requested  close  supervision  of  project  implementation  by  the\nbeneficiary representatives. Accordingly, project implementation arrangements have included the\nestablishment of the RCC (para. 83), which is expected to be an effective mechanism for project\nmonitoring and conveying farmers\u2019 concerns and demands to MAWR and ADB. The MEU to be\nestablished under the Project (paras. 67) will collect baseline information on the nature and\nincidence of poverty in the Project area, and develop poverty indicators to monitor and evaluate\nthe Project\u2019s impacts on poverty reduction. Women representatives will serve in the RCC and\nactively participate in monitoring, especially the impacts of the Project on women.", "26\nH.  Technical Assistance\n105.  The objective of the associated TA is to strengthen the existing RBAC in the Project area\nto provide agribusiness advisory and agricultural extension services to the beneficiaries (Appendix\n8).  The  TA  will  (i)  provide  institutional  support  to  RBAC,  facilitate  the  development  of  its\noperational strategy and management systems, and strengthen its staff capacity; (ii) facilitate the\nongoing farm restructuring; (iii) strengthen the agricultural extension system; (iv) improve water\nmanagement; and (v) promote beneficiary participation in project implementation.\n106.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 equivalent\nwill be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the TA Special Fund. The TA will provide for 20\nperson-months of international and 44 person-months of domestic consultants. The consultants\nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother procedures acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will\ncommence during the first year of project implementation and will be completed in 18 months.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1.  Financial Analysis\n107.   With the Project, the annual production of the major crops (cotton and wheat) will rise\nsteadily over an eight-year period, and will be maintained thereafter. Cotton production in the\nProject area will rise from about 28,000 t in 2001 to about 56,000 t in year 8, and wheat from\nabout  33,200  t  in  2001  to  about  49,000  tons  in  year  8.  With  increased  crop  yields  and\nrationalization  of  the  production  cost  structure  of  the  farms  through  gradual  restructuring\n(Appendix 9, para. 27), the proposed project investments are projected to generate an overall\nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of 13.7 percent in constant 2001 prices. In the event that\ncotton and wheat yields decrease by 10 percent simultaneously, FIRR would decline to 12.0\npercent. A 10 percent reduction in the prices of both cotton and wheat would give a FIRR of 11.1\npercent.\n2.  Economic Analysis\n108.  The economic analysis was based on the domestic price numeraire, and adjustments\nwere made to reflect the removal of taxes and duties, the exclusion of debt service charges, and\nthe application of a shadow exchange rate factor of 2.0 to the border prices of traded inputs and\noutputs. Given a situation of less than full employment in the rural areas, a shadow wage rate\nfactor of 0.8 was used in the analysis. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is\nestimated at 26.2 percent. Essentially, the EIRR is robust. In the unlikely event, that the projected\nyields of cotton and wheat with the Project were reduced by 10 percent throughout the 25-year\nperiod, the EIRR of the Project will be reduced to 23.9 percent. When the projected prices for both\ncotton and wheat decline by 10 percent, the EIRR would drop to 23.3 percent. Detailed financial\nand economic analyses are in Appendix 9.\n109.  The sensitivity of the FIRR to depreciation of the local currency (sum) against the dollar\nwas tested in view of the Government\u2019s plan to liberalize the foreign exchange rate regime (para.\n5), which would lead to the depreciation of the local currency given the currently overvalued\nofficial exchange rate. Depreciation of the sum would cause prices in some of the tradable inputs\n(such as equipment) and outputs (wheat and cotton) to rise, while prices in sum of nontradable", "27\ninputs would lag behind. In general, the overall prices of farm outputs (wheat and cotton) are more\nsensitive than input prices to the foreign exchange rate, and the net impact of the local currency\ndepreciation against the dollar on the FIRR will be favorable. Therefore, the liberalization of the\nforeign exchange rate regime will have a substantial favorable impact on the financial conditions\nand profitability of the farms, and will substantially narrow the gap between the FIRR and the\nEIRR.27 The significant gap between the FIRR (13.7 percent) and EIRR (26.2 percent) is mainly\ndue to the fact that in the economic analysis, the price distortions created by the fixed exchange\nrate policy have been removed through the application of a shadow exchange rate factor of 2.0.\n3.  Cost Recovery\n110.  Farms will repay the State for the costs of rehabilitating the on-farm drainage and irrigation\nsystems, while the State will pay for (i) the rehabilitation of the interfarm systems; (ii) the costs of\ninstitutional  support,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (iii)  all  expenses  related  to  project\nadministration and management. The on-farm rehabilitation costs were estimated at $1,100/ha,\nequivalent to SUM386,100/ha at the official exchange rate in constant 2001 prices.\n111.  The State will recover costs from the farms in the form of an infrastructure betterment levy\nover a period of 25 years including a 5-year grace period. This betterment levy was estimated as\nfollows. The on-farm investment costs were accounted for in the local currency at the prevailing\nofficial exchange rate. Interest charges during construction, or the five-year grace period, were\ncapitalized as part of the investment costs. Cost recovery will be made in the local currency. For\nestimation  purposes,  an  interest  rate  of  7  percent  per  annum  in  real  terms  was  used  for\ncalculating interest during the grace period, and for the repayment over the 20-year period. The\nbetterment levy was calculated in equal annual installments in constant 2001 prices, comprising\nprincipal repayment and interest charges. Based on the projected cash flow analyses, the farms\ncan afford the cost recovery payments of about SUM50,000/ha in constant 2001 prices from year\n6 to 25.\n4.  Project Risks\n112.  A number of risks may affect project implementation. Policy deficiencies remain in the\noverall economy and in the agriculture sector including State control of foreign currency, price\ndistortion caused by the overvalued official exchange rate, State involvement in price fixation, the\nremaining (although in a substantially reduced volume) mandatory State procurement quota for\ncotton and wheat, and State control on cropping patterns. The Project\u2019s financial and economic\nanalyses,  including  the  calculation  of  the  FIRR  and  EIRR,  are  based  on  a  conservative\nassumption that these policy deficiencies will remain during the entire project implementation\nperiod.28 Even under such a restricted policy environment, the Project will remain financially and\neconomically viable and sustainable because of the substantial gains in crop productivity. Using\nthe procurement prices following the stipulations in COM Resolution No. 201, the results of the\nfarm model simulations show that the Project will generate attractive financial returns to farms,\nallowing the farms to have the financial capacity to fully repay the investment costs of on-farm\nrehabilitation (Appendix 9). However, the financial analysis assumes that the State procurement\nprices of cotton and wheat will continue to be set at the international import and export parity\nlevels projected at the prevailing official exchange rate. To safeguard this assumption, specific\nassurances have been obtained that the Government will annually review the State procurement\n                                                \n27 Unification of the exchange rate will have no impact on the EIRR, which is estimated using a shadow exchange rate\nfactor of 2.0.\n28 The project benefits will increase if the policy constraints are further relaxed. In particular, if exchange rate unification\noccurs (para. 5), the Project\u2019s financial returns and farm profits will increase substantially.", "28\nprices of cotton and wheat to ensure that future adjustments of these prices fully reflect the annual\ninflation rate and changes in the international prices, and also adjust for changes in the exchange\nrate (para. 125 [iii]).\n113.  The track record of project implementation in Uzbekistan has not been fully satisfactory.\nFactors underlying this problem were carefully studied during the project design (para. 49).\nIncorporating lessons learned, the project design emphasizes simplicity and implementability. In\nparticular, the proposed policy reforms are based on the Government\u2019s reform initiatives. The\nimplementability of the reform measures is carefully examined through close consultations with\nGovernment  implementation  agencies,  and  assurances  have  been  obtained  from  senior\nGovernment officials.\n114.  To simplify the project design, the focus of investment will be the rehabilitation of the\nirrigation and drainage systems. Since MAWR has a sufficient number of technical staff who are\nexperienced in designing and constructing irrigation and drainage systems, the risk of the EA\u2019s\nlack of technical competence is judged as small.\n115.  Incorporating lessons learned, the Project has established its implementation structure at\nan early stage. The staff of the offices that will be involved in project implementation have\nparticipated in project design to foster a sense of ownership of the Project and strengthen their\ncommitment to project implementation.\n116.  To overcome MAWR's lack of project implementation experience and to familiarize it with\nADB operations, training in ADB operational policies, guidelines, and procedures has been and\nwill continue to be provided to the project staff. In addition, international and domestic consultants\nwill be recruited to (i) assist PMO and PSO to set up appropriate operational systems, and (ii)\nprovide hands-on training to the project staff. To ensure high-quality project staff and their stability,\ndetailed  job  descriptions  and  qualification  requirements  have  been  developed  in  close\nconsultation with the Government. MAWR gave the assurance that qualified and experienced staff\nacceptable to ADB will be assigned to these offices; measures will be taken to avoid staff\nturnover;  and  additional  staff  will  be  assigned  to  PMO,  PSO,  and  WG  to  support  project\nimplementation whenever necessary.\n117.  Potential delays in release of counterpart funds, slow procedure of Government internal\napproval for use of loan proceeds, and lack of cooperation among Government agencies may\ndelay procurement and consultant recruitment. These systematic issues have been brought to the\nattention of top Government officials and a set of measures was developed to improve the\nsituation (para. 48). The Government gave the assurance that counterpart funds will be adequate\nand timely during the project period. The interministerial PSC and WG will identify and resolve\nissues that need coordination among multiple Government agencies. The authority to approve for\nproject implementation has been delegated to the director general of RRA (paras. 78-79). ADB\u2019s\nloan review missions will closely monitor the actual implementation of these arrangements and\ndevelop remedial measures accordingly.\n118.  Lack of participation by farmer beneficiaries in the development of the cost-recovery\nscheme may lead to default in farmers\u2019 payments. To minimize this risk, close consultations with\nfarmer  beneficiaries  were  conducted  at  every  stage  of  project  preparation,  including  the\npresentation of the estimated investment costs of the on-farm rehabilitation on a per hectare\nbasis, expected crop yield increases under the Project, and farm financial returns and cash flows\n(paras. 85, 108-109). An information campaign at the start of project implementation will further\nraise farmer beneficiaries\u2019 awareness of their rights, options, and responsibilities in cost recovery;", "29\nand will develop a detailed investment plan, cost-recovery scheme, and repayment schedule with\nthem. Suitable mechanisms will need to be developed to collect repayments for the investment\nand user fees for O&M. In conjunction with training for WUAs, the TA consultants and the RBAC\nstaff will facilitate development of collection mechanisms. The Government has assured it will take\nnecessary actions to ensure that WUAs can perform their functions: organizing and training water\nusers, signing contracts for water allocation and O&M services, and collecting user fees from\nmembers (para. 125 [vi]).\n119.  A number of factors may also affect the achievement and sustainability of the project\nbenefits: (i) lower-than-anticipated crop yields; (ii) falling international prices for cotton and wheat;\n(iii)  default  in  repayments  for  cost  recovery;  and  (iv)  unsustainable  operations  of  the  rural\ninstitutions strengthened or established under the Project, such as RBAC, MEU, and WUA. These\nfactors  have  been  considered  in  the  project  design.  Estimates  of  the  project  benefits  are\ndeliberately based on conservative assumptions using cotton yields historically achieved in the\nproject area. Prices applied in the analysis are based on the World Bank commodity price forecast\n(January 2001), which predicts a slow recovery of cotton and wheat prices in 2005 from the\ncurrent depression. Sensitivity analysis confirms that the Project will generate robust returns to the\ninvestment even under adverse conditions (paras. 107-109 and Appendix 9). Finally, Government\nassurance has been obtained to finance the MEU operations after project completion. To sustain\nthe operations of RBAC and WUA after project completion, substantial efforts will be given during\nthe project period to strengthen their capacity in providing services to farmers and collecting user\nfees, including the establishment of sound operational systems and capacity building for their staff\n(paras. 62 - 65).\nB.  Environment\n120.  The  Project  will  have  an  overall  positive  environmental  impact.  Lowering  of  the\nunderground water table, reclamation of saline lands, and reduction in the salinity of drainage\nwater  through  effective  operation  of  the  rehabilitated  and  improved  irrigation  and  drainage\nsystems will create an environment more appropriate for human health, biodiversity, and crop\nproduction. The lowering water table will also reduce the incidence of waterborne diseases. Crop\nyield increases will improve farm incomes and enable farmers to improve their nutrition, health\ncare, water supply, and sanitation. Such improvement will raise the general health standards of\nthe project beneficiaries. Failure to correct the current problems will almost certainly lead to further\ndeterioration of health standards, and more areas of fertile land will be subject to secondary\nsalinization.  Training  in  IPM,  and  improved  practices  in  fertilizer  application  and  water\nmanagement will lead to rational use of agrochemicals and more efficient use of water resources.\nStrengthening  the  capacity  of  the  environmental  monitoring  agencies  will  ensure  regular\nenvironmental monitoring and early warning to permit corrective measures. The formation of\nWUAs and training them in water management and O&M will contribute to sustaining the Project\u2019s\nenvironmental benefits.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n1.  Poverty Reduction\n121.  The Project will have a significant impact on poverty reduction in the Project area. There\nare no official data on poverty in Ak Altin; however, it is estimated that about 12 percent of the\ndistrict's 9,640 families who live on less than $18 per capita per month (para. 27) are in need of\nsocial  assistance.  The  majority  of  the  poor  in  the  Project  area  are  workers  on  the  large\ncooperative farms, which have been incurring losses and are unable to regularly pay cash wages", "30\nto  their  workers.  Lacking  alternative  income  sources,  farm  workers  rely  on  production  from\nhousehold plots and irregular payment in kind from their cooperative farms, and thus suffer from\ndeclining living standards. By doubling cotton yield, the Project is expected to transform the loss-\nincurring farms into financially sustainable enterprises, including restructured farms and private\nfarms. Farm workers and their families will benefit from increased wage payments in a timely\nmanner; their living standards will be improved accordingly. Furthermore, the rehabilitation of the\ndrainage systems in the settlement areas will directly improve living conditions for the rural\nresidents by lowering the underground water tables and mitigating the flooding problems in the\nwinter and spring seasons. With rising farm incomes, local communities will have the financial\ncapability to spend for social services leading to improved sanitary conditions and public health.\nSince women and men have equal access to land in the Project area, and since water appears to\nbe equitably distributed and cropping patterns are uniformly based on cotton and wheat across all\nfarms, the benefits are expected to be distributed evenly in the Project area among all social\ngroups, including women farmers and wives of farm workers.\n122.  Small private farmers will benefit from the machinery services to be provided under the\nProject. Many small farmers currently do not have sufficient access to timely farm machinery\nservices; thus, farm operations are delayed, crop yields are low, and product quality is poor. The\nadditional choice of renting machinery from the RAWD Unit will further promote competition in\nfarm machinery services, leading to better services and prices for all farmers. Rural people will\nalso benefit from increased employment opportunity, as increased cotton production will use more\nlabor, especially during weeding and harvesting seasons.\n2.  Improved Rural Institutions\n123.  The beneficiaries, especially the small private farmers, will benefit from the strengthened\nrural institutions. WUAs established and strengthened under the Project will organize the small\nindividual farmers, ensure their access to irrigation water supply, and arrange O&M services for\nthem. In the long term, WUAs will become a permanent structure in the rural area to organize\nfarmers in other activities such as input purchasing and output marketing. In addition to promoting\nfarmers\u2019 participation in project implementation, RCC (para. 83) will likely empower farmers to\nactively participate in other local community activities.\n3.  Women in Development\n124.  Women will have equal access to all services provided by the Project, including business\nadvice, agricultural extension services, and training provided by RBAC and WUAs. Women will\nalso benefit from the enhanced employment opportunities brought about by increased cotton\nharvests. Women representatives will serve in RCC and participate in project implementation and\nmonitoring, particularly in the information campaign. Social surveys at the start of the Project will\ncollect benchmark information including gender-disaggregated data, and consult with the project\nbeneficiaries in developing measures to ensure that the rural poor, vulnerable groups, women,\nand small farmers benefit fully from the Project.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n125.  The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:", "31\n(i)  The Government will not increase the procurement quotas of 17,000 t for raw\ncotton and 12,500 t for wheat in the Project area.\n(ii)  The Government will ensure that farmers in the Project area receive advance\npayments for cotton and wheat production on time, and the final payments for\ncotton and wheat within three months after crop delivery.\n(iii)  The Government will review annually the State procurement prices for raw cotton\nand wheat, and ensure that any future adjustments of prices for each quality grade\nwill fully reflect the annual inflation rates and changes in international border prices\nof input and outputs, and adjust for changes in the exchange rate, so that the\nprocurement prices will give farmers sufficient price incentives for production.\n(iv)  In accordance with COM Resolution No. 201, the Government will ensure that the\nfarms and individual farmers are entitled to sell their above-quota cotton and wheat\nto buyers in the domestic market at mutually agreed upon prices. The Government\nwill review implementation of the Resolution on the basis of experience gained\nduring the first year of project implementation.\n(v)  The Government will review periodically its countrywide State procurement policies\nfor  raw  cotton  and  wheat  to  foster  and  develop  market  competition  and\nparticipation of the private sector. The Government will carry out such a review,\ntaking into account an assessment of the impacts of the procurement system in the\nProject area, on the first year anniversary of the loan effectivity date.\n(vi)  The Government will take all necessary actions to ensure that WUAs can perform\ntheir functions, including but not limited to organizing and training water users,\nsigning contracts for water allocation and O&M services, collecting from members\nuser  fees  for  O&M  activities,  introducing  water  management  measures,  and\nassuming responsibility for O&M of their irrigation and drainage systems.\n(vii)  The Government will ensure adequate allocation and timely provision of State\nbudgetary funds for O&M of interfarm irrigation and drainage facilities in the Project\narea  until  such  time  when  the  WUAs  possess  the  necessary  financial,\nadministrative,  and  management  capacity  to  assume  this  responsibility.  The\nGovernment will consult with ADB in assessing such capacity prior to transferring\nO&M responsibility for interfarm irrigation and drainage facilities in the Project area\nto the WUAs.\n(viii)  The Government will ensure that the Project is implemented in accordance with\nrelevant environmental laws and regulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\nThe Government will also ensure regular monitoring of the Project\u2019s environmental\nimpacts in accordance with the relevant national environmental standards. The\nMEU  will  be  established  in  Ak  Altin  with  two  full-time  staff  specializing  in\nenvironment and sociology. It will facilitate regular monitoring of environmental\nparameters in accordance with the environmental monitoring plan given in the\nsummary initial environmental examination.", "32\nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n126.  The Government has agreed to the following conditions for effectiveness of the Loan\nAgreement:\n(i)  establishment of the RAWD Unit to operate and maintain farm machinery and earn\nrevenues for farm machinery services; and\n(ii)  execution and delivery of a subsidiary loan agreement on farm machinery services\nbetween MOF and RAWD Unit, acceptable to ADB.\nC.  Condition for Disbursement\n127.  With respect to the loan proceeds for on-farm rehabilitation civil works, the Government\nhas agreed that disbursement will be subject to submission of evidence satisfactory to ADB that\nthe farmer beneficiaries have (i) been presented design alternatives by the Government and the\nconsultants, (ii) understood the costs and cost recovery implications of these alternatives, and (iii)\ndiscussed and agreed on (with respect to a majority of farmers) a design for the rehabilitation\nworks and the associated cost-recovery plan.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n128.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB\nand recommend that the Board approve the loan of $36,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital\nresources to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project, with a\nterm of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and with interest to be determined in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan\nAgreement presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n30 July 2001", "33\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1.

Land Area and Cropping Pattern\n1.  The  project  area  in  Ak  Altin  district  covers  approximately  37,000  hectares  (ha)  of\nirrigated cropland. As of May 2001, about 5,855 ha was cultivated by 165 small private farms,\nand the remainder by 12 large cooperative farms. The two major crops in Ak Altin are cotton\nand wheat, annually utilizing 54 percent and 39 percent of the irrigated cropland, respectively.\nThe remaining 7 percent of the irrigated cropland is planted to several minor crops: maize (3\npercent), fruit (2 percent), vegetables (1 percent), and alfalfa (1 percent). This cropping pattern\nis expected to remain, as the Government pursues an import substitution policy for wheat and\nrelies heavily on cotton to generate foreign exchange.\n2.  Agricultural lands in Ak Altin were originally converted from steppes by installing and\noperating irrigation and drainage systems on which crop cultivation depends.  Following the\ncollapse of the former Soviet Union, State farms were reorganized as new cooperative farms,\nwhich essentially retained the organization, management, and operational features of the old\nState farm. However, changes were introduced recently to revitalize the incentive structure for\nthe  production  units  of  the  farms.  Typically,  a  cooperative  farm  has  3,000  ha  of  irrigated\ncropland.  Although  crop  cultivation  and  harvesting  are  generally  mechanized,  an  average\ncooperative farm maintains a large workforce of 700-1,000 people. Until early 1999 when the\nGovernment  introduced  measures  to  reduce  the  financial  burden  of  the  farms,  the\nresponsibilities of cooperative farms were more than just farming. The cooperative farms were\nobliged to provide funds for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of schools, hospitals, and\npublic facilities such as water supply, electricity, heating, sewage, etc.\nB.  State Procurement of Wheat and Cotton\n3.  The State controls the cropping pattern of the farms, cotton procurement, and to some\nextent wheat procurement to provide financial incentives to the farms. The Government in May\n2001 replaced the annual production target of 50,000 tons (t) for cotton and wheat separately\nwith a fixed procurement quota of 17,000 t for cotton and 12,500 t for wheat. The Government\nalso abolished joint responsibility for fulfilling the procurement quota.\n4.  The  production  target  of  wheat,  which  was  valid  until  May  2001,  was  effectively\nequivalent to a yield target of 3.5 t/ha, compared with the actual average wheat yield of 2.2 t/ha.\nThe quantity of wheat procured by the State from the project area farms represented 50 percent\nof the wheat production target of 50,000 t, which is equivalent to 25,000 t annually. Given the\ndeclining wheat yields in the district, the State procurement has increased proportionally against\nthe actual production and effectively amounted to about 95 percent of the district's actual wheat\nproduction of 26,978 t in 2000. Given the amount of wheat procured by the State, little was left\nfor farmers to sell at the local markets. Farmers sold much of the remaining wheat to their own\nworkers at prices equivalent to the State procurement prices. Nonetheless, the State provided a\n20 percent price premium over and above the published procurement prices of wheat for the\nquantities purchased by the State exceeding 25 percent of the production target. Thus, the price\npremium applied to State purchases of wheat over and above 12,500 t.\n5.  The annual fixed quota of 12,500 t of wheat is equivalent to 0.9 t/ha, compared with the\naverage wheat yield of about 2.2 t/ha in 2000 in the district. Once farmers have fulfilled their\nState procurement obligation, they can sell their above-quota wheat at the local markets at\nprevailing prices. State procurement prices of wheat presently reflect a range of quality grades,", "56 Appendix 9, page 2\nand are essentially equivalent to farmgate import parity financial prices at the official exchange\nrate.  Nevertheless,  wheat  prices  at  the  local  markets  are  generally  higher  than  the  State\nprocurement prices. In May 2001, the price of wheat at the local markets was at least 50\npercent higher than the State procurement price. By limiting the State procurement of wheat, the\nProject will create a financial incentive for farmers to increase wheat crop productivity.\n6.  Up to the cropping year 2000, all cotton was procured through Khlopkoprom, a State\njoint stock company which has, throughout the country, processing facilities for cotton including\ndrying, cleaning, grading, ginning, certifying, and packing. The processed cotton was sold to\nforeign  traders  through  local  private  trading  firms  registered  with  the  Ministry  of  External\nEconomic Relations. These local private traders handled almost all cotton export and were\nobliged to surrender all foreign exchange earnings to the Government at official exchange rate.\nAt the local level, farms entered into contractual agreements with designated cotton ginning\nfactories. These contracts covered scheduled advance payments, crop deliveries, and other\nobligations. State procurement prices for cotton were determined by the State, taking into\naccount quality grades; international prices (cost, insurance and freight [CIF] Liverpool); the\nofficial exchange rate; freight, insurance, and ginning costs; and less efficient management by\nvarious Government agencies.\n7.  While the cotton procurement arrangements mentioned above will continue for the rest\nof the country, procurement in Ak Altin Rayon will be governed by the Cabinet of Ministers\nResolution No. 102 issued on 2 May 2001. The farmers of Ak Altin Rayon will be free to sell\ntheir above-quota cotton production to legal trading entities at mutually agreed upon prices.\nAlthough  the  Government  has  estimated  the  price  premium  for  above-quota  cotton  at  40\npercent, a conservative price premium of 12 has been used in financial and economic analysis.\nC.  Potential and Challenges\n8.  All farms in Ak Altin, with the exception of a few private ones, have been unprofitable in\nrecent years as they face (i) declining crop productivity due to deteriorating conditions of the\ndrainage and irrigation systems, (ii) excessive labor costs and social obligations, (iii) heavy\nfinancial burdens for maintaining social and communal infrastructure, (iv) high administrative\ncosts, (v) multiple and high taxes, and (vi) low prices for their crops under the centralized State\nprocurement system. Average yields of cotton and wheat have declined to 1.4 t/ha and 2.3 t/ha,\nrespectively, due to the poorly functioning irrigation and drainage systems. Without rehabilitation\nof these systems, per hectare yields are expected to decline further to 1.0 t/ha for cotton and 1.4\nt/ha  for  wheat  over  the  next  eight  years.  Essentially,  farms  have  been  squeezed  by  a\ncombination of high production costs and fixed costs, and low revenues. This dismal operating\nenvironment  has  led  the  farms  to  accumulate  massive  debts  to  the  State  and  their  input\nsuppliers.\n9.  Given the momentum generated by the reform initiatives and the pricing incentives for\nwheat and cotton, the Project is designed to improve agricultural productivity in the district and\nincrease farm incomes and profitability by rehabilitating the irrigation and drainage systems.\nWith  the  improved  infrastructure  restoring  crop  productivity  rapidly,  farms  are  expected  to\nimprove  their  financial  health  and  profitability.  Although  the  financial  responsibility  for\nmaintaining  social  and  community  infrastructure  has  been  removed  from  the  farms  and\ntransferred to the State, cooperative farms still face high fixed costs and inefficient use of inputs.\nThe farms will be encouraged to undertake a number of measures to achieve higher revenues,\nand introduce financial discipline to reduce costs. The Rural Business Advisory Center (RBAC)\nwill  provide  advisory  services  to  participating  farms,  in  the  context  of  an  overall  business", "Appendix 9, page 3\n57\nplanning  and  farm  management  initiatives,  including  aspects  related  to  agronomy,  pest\nmanagement, and O&M of the irrigation and drainage systems.\n10.  With the Project, three major factors will lead to higher farm revenues: (i) incremental\ncrop yields and prevention of further decline in crop yields due to the deteriorating irrigation and\ndrainage systems; (ii) prevention of crop losses by improving the timeliness of cultivation and\nharvests through increased availability of farm machinery services. and (iii) higher prices for\nabove-quota cotton and wheat through crop quality improvements. The analyses here were\ndeliberately  conservative  to  exclude  the  potential  additional  benefits  from  quality  grade\nimprovement.  At  present,  the  crop  quality  grades  of  Ak  Altin  farms  are  below  standard.\nConsequently, the prices the farms receive for these commodities have been substantially\ndiscounted at rates ranging from 5 to 30 percent of the listed State procurement prices for the\nhighest quality grades. In the medium term, over a period of 5-10 years, there is much room for\nimproving  crop  vigor  and  quality  grade  through  (i)  better  selection  of  seeds,  (ii)  improved\nagronomic practices, and (iii) upgraded pest management.\n11.  Farms  can  undertake  several  cost-saving  measures  in  the  medium  term,  without\nresorting to drastic measures that may have negative social impacts. The cooperative farms\ngenerally have a large permanent workforce of 700-1,000 workers although farm operations are\ntypically seasonal. In addition, the cooperative farms also have a heavy layer of administrative\nand  management  staff,  and  face  excessive  overhead  expenses  for  administration  and\nmanagement. The workforce may be gradually reduced through natural attrition over a period of\neight years, without replacement, as many workers are retiring or leaving the farms on their own\nvolition. Labor requirements at peak times can then be satisfied with seasonal labor, thereby\nreducing fixed expenses on wages and benefits. Essentially, the farms can gradually streamline\ntheir labor force and social obligations, and increase their seasonal labor inputs, when required,\nat peak times. Additionally, the farms can also rationalize their farm machinery operations to\nsave costs by (i) limiting the use of transport facilities to farming purposes only, and preventing\nunauthorized uses of trucks, tractors, and wagons for other activities; (ii) improving agronomic\npractices to minimize seeding failure, and therefore avoid repeated mechanization for seeding;\n(iii) minimizing turnaround and idle running time for machinery to save fuel; and (iv) improving\npreventive  maintenance  to  avoid  costly  machinery  repairs  and  overhaul.  There  are  other\npossibilities for cost savings (effective application rates of fertilizers and agrochemicals for\nspecific crops), but specific measures will have to be designed according to the circumstances\nfaced by the farms. The services of RBAC will therefore address the overall farm management\ninitiatives  that  can  be  feasibly  undertaken  in  the  context  of  the  progressively  changing\nenvironment for market-oriented farming.\n12.  At present, there is little flexibility for changing the cropping pattern dictated by the State.\nThe  following  analyses  are  conservative,  essentially  assuming  no  change  in  the  current\npractice. However, in the event the State relaxes its control on the cropping pattern and allows\nthe  farms  to  determine  their  own  cropping  pattern  for  as  long  as  they  meet  the  State\nprocurement quotas for wheat and cotton, the farms will very likely grow less wheat in favor of\ncotton. The gross margins per hectare for cotton are expected to be higher than those for wheat\nwhen potential incremental yields are fully realized.\nD.  Typical Farm Models\n13.  To illustrate the financial viability of farms in the project area, two typical farm models\nwere developed: (i) a cooperative farm with a landholding of 3,000 ha of irrigated cropland,\nemploying a permanent workforce of 700 workers; and (ii) a private farm with 125 ha of irrigated", "58 Appendix 9, page 4\ncropland, employing 15 permanent workers. Both types of farm maintain the same cropping\npattern as described in para. 1.  Although the variable costs of production on these farms are\nsimilar, the cooperative farm has proportionally higher fixed costs than the private farm. These\nfixed costs are mainly associated with (i) the wages and social benefits for the permanent\nworkforce, (ii) power and energy consumption, (iii) maintenance for farm buildings and facilities,\nand (iv) administration and management costs. The private farms are generally not burdened\nwith heavy fixed costs, given their lean management structure and flexibility in utilizing seasonal\nlabor to complement their small workforce.\nE.  Major Assumptions\n14.  Typical 1 ha crop budgets were estimated for scenarios with and without rehabilitated\nirrigation  and  drainage  systems.  Direct  farm  inputs  consisting  of  seeds,  fertilizers,\nagrochemicals, labor, mechanization, and transport were estimated to reflect present practices\nand achievable improvement over an eight-year period.\n15.  With the Project, crop yields are expected to increase progressively over a period of\neight years: (i) cotton from an average of 1.4 t  to 2.8 t/ha, (ii) wheat from 2.3 t to 3.4 t/ha, (iii)\nmaize from 2.3 t to 3.1 t/ha, (iv) fruit from 3.2 t to 4.5 t/ha, (v) vegetables from 9.5 t to 13.3 t/ha,\nand (vi) alfalfa from 8.0 t to 11.2 t/ha. Without the Project, crop yields are expected to decline to\n(i) 1.0 t/ha for cotton, (ii) 1.4 t/ha for wheat, (iii) 1.2 t/ha for maize, (iv) 1.7 t/ha for fruit, (v) 5.0\nt/ha for vegetables, and (vi) 4.2 t/ha for alfalfa. The assumed yield gains with the Project are\ndeliberately modest and realistic, and are based on historical yields of the project area.\n16.  Foreign inflation rates follow the World Bank\u2019s projection of the manufacturing unit value\n(MUV) indices for inflation in US dollar terms of manufactures exported from the G-5 countries\n(France, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States), weighted proportionally to the\ncountries\u2019 exports to the developing countries. Accordingly, foreign inflation was projected at\n0.61 percent in 2001, 1.60 percent in 2002, 2.50 percent in 2005, and 2.48 percent in 2010 and\nthereafter.\n17.  Both financial and economic analyses were for a period of 25 years in 2001 constant\nprices and in the local currency, the sum. Year 1 represents year 2001, the year in which the\nProject is expected to commence.\n18.  The Government official exchange rate1 was assumed at SUM345.00 to $1.00 (actual,\nApril 2001). Direct and indirect foreign exchange contents of input and output prices were\nconverted  to  the  local  currency  using  the  official  exchange  rate.2  The  use  of  the  official\n                                                \n1 This official exchange rate is overvalued, and is maintained for currency transactions conducted at the Uzbek\nRepublican Currency Exchange (URCE). The primary sources of supply of foreign exchange at the URCE are\nmandatory sales of foreign exchange proceeds of cotton and gold at the overvalued exchange rate; and the\nprimary uses of foreign exchange sold through URCE are external public debt service and State-approved imports\nof capital and other goods to support State-sponsored programs and projects. The State allows commercial banks\nand exchange bureaus to conduct foreign exchange transactions. The exchange rates in the commercial market\nare formally determined by market forces, but are maintained by the State at below the market clearing level. The\ncommercial exchange rate was SUM675.00/690 (buying/selling) to $1.00 (actual, May 2001). There is a thriving\ncurb foreign exchange market to cater to the excess demand for foreign exchange. The cash curb rate was\nSUM920 to $1.00 (May 2001). The official segments of the foreign exchange transactions control the bulk of the\ntotal transactions in the country. Accurate estimates of the size of the curb market were difficult to obtain. The high\ncurb rate was also influenced by transaction risks and law enforcement.\n2  The State procurement prices of tradable cotton and wheat, as determined at export and import parity levels using\nthe overvalued official exchange rate, and less efficient processing and management by various government\nagencies effectively represent an implicit taxation on the farms. The financial farmgate prices of cotton and wheat", "59 Appendix 9, page 5\nexchange rate for the financial analysis is appropriate, considering that (i) cotton is subject to a\n100 percent foreign exchange surrender requirement at the official rate; (ii) financial prices of\nfertilizers and other inputs, including machinery services, are controlled by the State, using the\nofficial  exchange  rate  for  converting  foreign  contents  to  the  local  currency;  (iii)  State\nprocurement prices for the major crops, cotton and wheat, are linked to the official exchange\nrate;  and  (iv)  the  State  uses  the  official  exchange  rate  for  converting  foreign  exchange\ninvestment costs to the local currency.\n19.  Cotton, wheat, and fertilizer prices were projected using the World Bank\u2019s commodity\nprice projections. Various adjustments for transport, handling, storage, insurance, intermediary\nmargins, and physical losses were made for determining farmgate prices. The financial and\neconomic farmgate prices of urea, potassium chloride, and phosphate were derived on an\nimport  parity  basis,  and  expressed  in  terms  of  their  nitrogen,  potassium,  and  phosphorus\nnutrient contents. The domestic prices of tradable fertilizers are presently controlled by the State\nand are largely distorted. In August 1999, the actual prices of fertilizers, on the basis of their\npure nutrient contents, were below their import parity equivalents at the official exchange rate by\nabout  44  percent  for  nitrogen,  62  percent  for  potassium,  and  12  percent  for  phosphate.\nFarmgate financial prices of fertilizers were projected to reach import parity levels at the official\nexchange rate over a period of five years, consistent with the Government\u2019s plan to reduce\npayments for farm support gradually.\n20.  Uzbekistan is a wheat-importing country. Thus, farmgate prices of wheat were derived\non  an  import  parity  basis,  using  neighboring  Kazakhstan\u2019s  export  parity  border  prices.\nKazakhstan\u2019s wheat exports to the Russian Federation compete with wheat exports to the\nRussian  Federation  from  the  United  States  (US)  and  Canada.  Therefore,  the  projected\ninternational  prices  of  wheat  for  the  region  were  based  on  the  Russian  markets,  around\nMoscow, as a destination reference for major exports in the region. The average local wheat\ngrades are of the third quality grade, carrying a price discount of about 15 percent on average\nagainst the first grade. The projected international prices of wheat (free on board [FOB], US) for\nUS No.1 hard red winter wheat were used for estimating the equivalent border wheat prices\nafter  adjustments  for  quality,  freight  and  insurance  costs,  and  charges  for  handling  and\ntransport. In deriving farmgate prices of wheat, further adjustments to the border prices were\nmade to account for costs associated with elevator storage, physical losses, drying, and local\ntransport.\n21.  Uzbekistan is a major cotton exporter in the world. Accordingly, farmgate prices of seed\ncotton (raw cotton) were derived from the projected international prices of cotton fiber ([CIF],\nEurope), by adjusting for (i) quality discount of about 8 percent for Uzbekistan\u2019s average grades;\n(ii) railway transport and insurance; (iii) intermediary costs including ginning costs; and (iv) the\nvalue of by-products such as seeds, fluff, and lint. On average, the quantity of fiber produced\namounts to about 30 percent of seed cotton by weight. The value of by-products represents\nabout 10 percent of the value of the fiber equivalent.\n22.  The economic analysis was based on the domestic price numeraire, and adjustments to\nfinancial prices were made to reflect the removal of taxes of 10 percent, the exclusion of debt\nservice charges, and the application of a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 2.0 to the\nborder prices of tradable inputs and outputs. The basic wage rates on the farms in 2001 were\n                                                                                                                                                         \nin 2001 were estimated at $273/t (export parity) and $124/t (import parity), respectively. On the other hand, the use\nof the overvalued official exchange rate for pricing tradable agricultural inputs represents an implicit subsidy to the\nfarms.", "60 Appendix 9, page 6\nestimated at SUM388/day, excluding pension and insurance charges amounting to 40 percent\nof the basic wages. Given a situation of less than full employment in the rural areas, a shadow\nwage rate factor (SWRF) of 0.8 was used in the analysis. The labor content for civil works was\nestimated at 35 percent. Therefore, the economic prices of civil works were calculated by\napplying a conversion factor of 0.93 to the net-of-tax financial prices of civil works.\nF.  Benefits\n23.  The benefits from rehabilitating irrigation and drainage were derived from the expected\nincreases in crop yields, and prevention of further decline of crop yields. With the Project, the\nexpected annual production levels of the cultivated crops were estimated to rise steadily over an\neight-year period: (i) cotton, from 27,972 t to 55,736 t; (ii) wheat, from 33,189 t to 49,035 t; (iii)\nmaize, from 2,553 t to 3,417 t; (iv) fruit, from 2,368 t to 3,321 t; (v) vegetables, from 3,515 t to\n4,930 t; and (vi) alfalfa, from 2,960 t to 4,152 t. Without the Project, the annual crop production\nlevels would decline over an eight-year period to 19,117 t for cotton, 20,276 t for wheat, 1,347 t\nfor maize, 1,250 t for fruit, 1,855 t for vegetables, and 1,562 t for alfalfa.\nG.  Farm Net Incomes, Cash Flows, and Cost Recovery\n24.  For estimating the profitability of the farms and their capacity to repay the Government\nfor part of the investment costs, financial projections estimated farm net income before debt\nservice. Both income and cash flow analyses were performed in constant 2001 prices, rather\nthan in the conventional current terms, for two reasons: (i) the domestic inflation forecast was\nhighly speculative, with a history of hyperinflation; and (ii) the present exchange rate regime is a\nhighly administered system, with two different legal exchange rates (official and commercial\nrates), against a backdrop of a thriving curb market. Thus, a cash flow analysis in constant\nprices provides a fair estimate of the magnitude of farm profitability and liquidity in real terms,\nespecially with the expectation that the Government will unify and float the exchange rates in\nthe near future. A number of key assumptions were made for the analysis:\n(i)  The Government would continue to provide scheduled installments of advance\npayments to farmers over the crop growing period for both cotton and wheat in\nan amount equivalent to 90 percent of the expected value of the crops. At\npresent, there are no alternative sources of trade financing to provide the farms\nwith the required working capital. Therefore, the State must provide assurances\nthat advance payments to the farms for cotton and wheat would continue for as\nlong as the State (a) retains certain controls over cotton marketing, (b) controls\ndomestic wheat production, and (c) dictates the cropping pattern for cotton and\nwheat.\n(ii)  On-farm investments for improving the drainage and irrigation systems were\nestimated at $1,100/ha. Beneficiaries would repay the Government only for the\non-farm investment, in the form of an infrastructure betterment levy over a period\nof 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years. The Government would bear\nfully all other investment costs. This betterment levy was estimated as follows.\nThe on-farm investment costs were accounted for in the local currency at the\nprevailing official exchange rate. Interest charges during construction, or the five-\nyear grace period, were capitalized as part of the investment costs. Repayment\nwould be made in the local currency. For estimation purposes, an interest rate of\n7 percent per annum in real terms was used in calculating interest charges\nduring  the  grace  period,  and  in  amortizing  the  repayment  of  the  on-farm", "61\nAppendix 9, page 7\ninvestment cost by the farms. The cost recovery payments were calculated in\nequal annual installments comprising capital repayment and interest charges.\n(iii)  A single and unified land tax of SUM1,842/ha was applied to the farms, based on\nan  average  land  fertility  score  for  the  district.  Sales  of  farm  outputs  would\ncontinue to be exempted from value-added taxes, as currently practiced. As of\n2001, there were practically no income taxes applicable to the farms. The farms\nsimply paid a single tax, which is the unified land tax.\n(iv)  Cooperative farms would undertake measures to reduce fixed charges related to\nexcessive administrative costs and redundant labor. Such measures would be\ncarried out gradually at an attainable rate of 2.5 percent annually for a maximum\nperiod of eight years.\n(v)  Cooperative farms would no longer be burdened with the financial obligation to\npay for maintaining public, social, and community infrastructures. It was projected\nthat the transfer of this financial obligation from the farms to the State budget\nwould not be reversed.\n(vi)  The  cost  for  O&M  of  the  rehabilitated  irrigation  and  drainage  systems  was\nestimated at $25/ha.\n(vii)  Rehabilitation of the irrigation and drainage systems would be undertaken in a\nfashion  that  would  minimize  disruption  of  farm  operations  and  prevent  crop\nproduction losses. With adequate planning and coordination, no crop losses were\nanticipated during the construction period.\n(viii)  The Government would periodically adjust the State procurement prices of cotton\nand wheat for inflation, changes in international prices, and movements in the\nexchange rate. Given that a double-digit inflation is expected to continue in the\nmedium term, the State procurement prices would rapidly be eroded in real terms\nif the Government would not periodically adjust the prices for inflation. Therefore,\nfor as long as the State administers the procurement prices of cotton and wheat,\nthe State must ensure that adjustments for inflation would be made periodically,\nin addition to adjustments due to changes in the international prices for the\ncommodities and the exchange rate. The financial viability and sustainability of\nthe Project, including the profitability of the farms, will be seriously jeopardized if\nthe State allows inflation to erode the procurement prices in real terms.\n(ix)  No  provision  was  made  for  payment  of  dividends  to  shareholders.  This\nassumption  was  made  to  show  cash  balances  that  would  reflect  retained\nearnings fully.\n25.  The summary results of income and cash flow analysis for a representative cooperative\nfarm are shown in Table A9.1. Essentially, the cooperative farms were projected to have higher\nper ha expenses, including production and fixed costs, than the private farms. The cooperative\nfarms are expected to continue with a large permanent labor. With the expected increases in\nfertilizer prices to reach import parity levels, and increases in O&M costs for the irrigation and\ndrainage systems, the total expenses of the cooperative farms were estimated to climb from\nSUM160,000/ha in year 1 to SUM226,000/ha in year 8 in constant 2001 prices. However, with\nthe  expected  improvement  in  international  prices  of  wheat  and  cotton,  coupled  with  the", "62 Appendix 9, page 8\nincreases in yields due to the Project, a typical cooperative farm with 3,000 ha area is expected\nto improve its profitability, from a loss of about SUM34.7 million in 2001 to a net income before\ndebt service in constant 2001 prices of SUM44.5 million in year 4, and SUM272.3 million in year\n8. With this improvement in financial performance, the large farms are expected to have the\ncapacity to pay for the betterment levy for on-farm rehabilitation over a 20-year period, and\ngenerate a net cash flow of SUM121.5 million in year 8 and thereafter. The debt service\ncoverage ratio was estimated at 1.8 in year 8 and thereafter. The detailed farm budget analysis\nfor  a  representative  cooperative  farm  is  provided  in  Supplementary  Appendix  H  (Detailed\nFinancial and Economic Analysis).\n26.  The summary results of income and cash flow analysis for a typical small private farm\nwith 1,500 ha area are shown in Table A9.2. For such small private farms, per ha expenses\nwere estimated to rise from SUM143,000/ha in year 1 to SUM212,000/ha in year 8 in constant\n2001 prices. The private farms are projected to improve their profitability steadily with the\nimprovement in crop yields. Net incomes before debt service were calculated  to increase from\nSUM0.7 million in year 1 to SUM13.0 million by year 8. The small private farms are also\nexpected to be able to pay for the betterment levy for on-farm rehabilitation cost over a period of\n20 years, starting from year 6. The debt service coverage ratio was estimated at 2.0 in year 8\nand thereafter, generating a net cash flow of about SUM6.7 million annually after debt service,\nin constant 2001 prices. The detailed farm budget analysis for a representative private farm is\nprovided in the Supplementary Appendix H (Detailed Financial and Economic Analysis).\nH.  Rates of Return on Rehabilitation of the Irrigation and Drainage Systems\n27.  The overall project investment is expected to generate a financial internal rate of return\n(FIRR) of 13.7 percent with a financial net present value of SUM2,035 million at a discount rate\nof 12 percent per annum. With economic prices calculated on the basis of the domestic price\nnumeraire, the overall economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project was estimated at\n26.2 percent with an economic net present value of SUM23,913 million. The significant gap\nbetween the FIRR (13.7 percent) and EIRR (26.2 percent) is mainly due to the fact that in the\neconomic analysis, the price distortions created by the fixed exchange rate policy have been\nremoved through the application of a shadow exchange rate factor of 2.0.\nI.  Sensitivity Analysis\n28.  The sensitivity of the FIRR and EIRR to decreases in yield and prices are presented in\nTable A9.3. The sensitivity of the FIRR to depreciation of the exchange rate of the local\ncurrency to the dollar is shown in Table A9.4.\n29.  In the unlikely event, that the projected yields of cotton and wheat with the Project were\nreduced by 10 percent throughout the 25-year period, the FIRR and the EIRR of the Project\nwould reduce to 12.0 percent and 23.9 percent, respectively. When the projected cotton prices\nalone declined by 10 percent, the FIRR and the EIRR would decline to 11.9 percent and 23.0\npercent, respectively. Should the projected wheat prices decline by 10 percent, the FIRR and\nthe EIRR of the Project would drop to 13.1 percent and 25.7 percent, respectively.\n30.  In the unlike event that the prices of both cotton and wheat decrease by 10 percent\nsimultaneously,  the  FIRR  and  EIRR  would  decline  to  11.1  percent  and  23.3  percent\nrespectively.", "   63 Appendix 9, page 9\nTable A9.1:  Typical Farm Budget\n Cooperative Farm, 3,000 ha\n('000 Sum in Constant 2001 Prices)\nYear  8-\nItem Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7\n25\nREVENUES, COSTS \nTotal Revenuesa 445,123 490,784 554,007 631,158 719,458 820,598 889,496 949,227\nTotal Costsb 479,857 500,058 530,941 586,657 624,745 641,848 661,581 676,965\nNet Income before debt service (34,734) (9,274) 23,066 44,500 94,713 178,750 227,915 272,262\nNet Income (before debt service) per ha (12) (3) 8 15 32 60 76 91\nTotal cost per ha 160 167 177 196 208 214 221 226\nCASH FLOW\nCash Inflow\n     Net Income before debt service (34,734) (9,274) 23,066 44,500 94,713 178,750 227,915 272,262\nCash Outflow 0 0 0 0 0 150,727 150,727 150,727\nNet Cash flow (34,734) (9,274) 23,066 44,500 94,713 28,023 77,188 121,535\nEnding Year Balance (34,734) (44,008) (20,942) 23,558 118,271 146,294 223,482 345,017\nEstimated Debt Service Coverage Ratio c  (5.5) (0.6) 4.6 7.2 13.0 1.2 1.5 1.8\na     The revenues from seed cotton, wheat, maize, fruit, vegetable, and alfalfa.\nb       This includes direct and indirect production costs.\nc      The ratio of net income (excluding depreciation, non-cash charges, interest and other charges on debt) against debt service including long-term           \n     loan principal repayments, and interest charges.\nTable A9.2:  Typical Farm Budget\n Private Farm, 125 ha\n('000 Sum in Constant 2001 Prices)\nYear  8-\nItem Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Year 6 Year 7\n25\nREVENUES, COSTS \nTotal Revenuesa 18,547 20,449 23,084 26,298 29,977 34,192 37,062 39,551\nTotal Costsb 17,822 18,810 20,242 22,192 23,924 24,783 25,750 26,537\nNet Income before debt service 725 1,640 2,841 4,107 6,053 9,409 11,312 13,014\nNet Income (before debt service) per ha 6 13 23 33 48 75 90 104\nTotal cost per ha 143 150 162 178 191 198 206 212\nCASH FLOW\nCash Inflow\n     Net Income before debt service 725 1,640 2,841 4,107 6,053 9,409 11,312 13,014\nCash Outflow 0 0 0 0 0 6,280 6,280 6,280\nNet Cash flow 725 1,640 2,841 4,107 6,053 3,129 5,032 6,734\nEnding Year Balance 725 2,364 5,206 9,312 15,366 18,494 23,526 30,259\nEstimated Debt Service Coverage Ratio c  4.3 7.7 11.6 14.8 19.5 1.5 1.8 2.0\na     The revenues from seed cotton, wheat, maize, fruit, vegetable, and alfalfa.\nb       This includes direct and indirect production costs.\nc      The ratio of net income (excluding depreciation, non-cash charges, interest and other charges on debt) against debt service including long-term           \n     loan principal repayments, and interest charges.", "64 Appendix 9, page 10\n31. The sensitivity of the FIRR to depreciation of the local currency to the dollar was tested.\nIn  the  event  that  the  sum  experiences  a  20  percent  depreciation,  from  SUM345.00/$1  to\nSUM431.00/$1, the FIRR is expected to rise to 14.5 percent. The FIRR will rise to 15.4 percent\nwhen the local currency depreciates by 30 percent. Depreciation of the sum would cause prices\nin sum of tradable inputs (such as equipment) and outputs (wheat and cotton) to rise, while\nprices in sum of nontradable inputs would lag behind. The overall prices of farm outputs (wheat\nand cotton) are more sensitive than input prices in general to the foreign exchange rate. The net\nimpact of the local currency depreciation against the dollar on the FIRR is favorable. Given the\ncurrently  overvalued  official  exchange  rate,  the  liberalization  of  the  foreign  exchange  rate\nregime would effectively lead to the depreciation of the local currency. The liberalization of the\nforeign exchange rate regime will have a substantial favorable impact on the financial conditions\nand profitability of the farms.\nTable A9.3: Switching Values for FIRR and EIRR\nItem Base 10% 10% 10% 10%\nCase (%) Decrease in Decrease in Decrease in Decrease in\nboth Cotton Cotton Price Wheat Price both Cotton\nand Wheat and Wheat\nYields Prices\nFIRRa (%) 13.7 12.0 11.9 13.1 11.1\nEIRR (%) 26.2 23.9 23.9 25.7 23.3\n        EIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return.\n        a  Includes all project investment costs.\nTable A9.4: Sensitivity of FIRRs to Local Currency Depreciation\nItem Base Case 20 percent Sum 30 percent Sum\nDepreciation Depreciation\nFIRRa  (%) 13.7 14.5 15.4\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.\na  Includes all project investment costs."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010814163757", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "rsa", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R113-01RRP.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010824091700+08'00'"}}
