During  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  Review  Mission  for  the  gender  strategy  and \nimplementation plan for agriculture and rural development1 in February 2004, the Ministry of \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD)  explored  the  possibility  of  ADB  providing \nassistance to support follow-up activities.  A brief proposal was sent to ADB in March 2004 and \ndiscussed during the Country Programming Mission in April 2004. The TA Fact-Finding Mission2 \nvisited Viet Nam from 19 to 30 July and 16 to 18 September 2004, and held discussions with the \nGovernment of Viet Nam on the goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference for consulting services.  The Government \nconfirmed the mission\u2019s Aide M\u00e9moire on 7 October 2004. The Gender and Development \nCooperation Fund donors gave concept clearance for financing the TA3 in July 2004. The TA \nFramework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES4 \n2.  During the economic reform process, farming households in Viet Nam acquired more \nrights and more important roles as self-administered units. Households received rights to long-\nterm use of land, and the power to make decisions on labor division, production, trade, and \ninvestment. However, reform policies have often targeted men as heads of households. The fact \nthat women have benefited less than men from the reform process not only influences the \nhousehold economy, but also creates an overall development constraint in the agriculture and \nrural development sector as women constitute more than half of the agricultural labor force.5 \nGreater efforts are required to develop the potential of rural women, help them to quickly gain \nthe capacity and confidence to play a key role in the sector, and empower them to be effective \nand equal partners of men. \n \n3.  A number of challenges need to be met before such empowerment and equality are \nrealized. First, social behaviors and attitudes to women remain patriarchal. Rural families tend \nto be largely controlled by men, and women defer to them throughout their lives. Within the \nMARD bureaucracy and among officials and public service providers in the field, social attitudes \nto gender roles, gender equality, division of labor, and leadership, and decision making continue \nto be biased by traditional values and gender stereotypes. Gender awareness and sensitivity \nare generally low in the sector.  \n \n4.  Second, although the lives of most people living in rural areas have improved, men still \nhave greater access than women to and control of resources critical to rural livelihoods. For \nexample, while women represent half to three quarters of the workforce in animal husbandry, \ndepending on the region, only about 20% of extension training courses on animal husbandry are \nattended by women. Despite the fact that 80% of rural women work in cultivation, they represent  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for Gender Strategy and Implementation \nPlan  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development.  Manila  (TA  3831  VIE,  approved  on  1  February  2002,  and \nimplemented from 1 June 2002 to 29 February 2004).   \n2  Comprising  Y.  Uehara,  senior  social  development  specialist,  Operations  Coordination  Division,  Mekong \nDepartment.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 9 July 2004.  \n4  This section heavily draws upon MARD. 2003. Gender Strategy in Agriculture and Rural Development to the Year \n2010. Hanoi. Culture-Information Publishing House.  \n5  For instance, land-use certificates for a household's common land as well as the land administration records have \nonly been registered in the name of the head of household, and most households are headed by men. This creates \nproblems for women when they need to provide security for accessing loans, etc. The amended Land Law contains \nan article on registration of both spouses of full families. \n ", "2  \nonly 10% of participants in horticulture training courses. Women agricultural extension workers \naccount for about 28% of the total, but generally their capacity to provide services remains low. \nIt is difficult to recruit qualified women extension workers, especially at the commune level. \nWomen are less able than men to take advantage of agricultural extension services and inputs. \n \n5.  Third,  MARD\u2019s  institutional  capacity  to  mainstream  gender  within  its  functional \nresponsibilities and internal operations is limited by a lack of human and financial resources, \ninstitutional  procedures  and  norms  and  organizational  culture,  among  other  factors.  The \ncapacity to make operations within MARD\u2019s functional and management departments more \ngender-responsive is limited to a few members of the Committee for the Advancement of \nWomen  (CFAW).  MARD  has  no  gender-sensitive  planning  and  monitoring  and  evaluation \nsystem.  Planning  processes  and  administrative  reforms  do  not  systematically  take  gender \nissues into account. Women\u2019s participation in decision making is low throughout the sector.  \n \n6.   In response to these challenges, with support from a previous TA (footnote 1), MARD \ndeveloped a gender strategy in agriculture and rural development to 2010 (the gender strategy) \nand a gender plan of action in agriculture and rural development to the year 2005 (the plan of \naction).6 The previous TA used a highly participatory approach designed to increase MARD\u2019s \ninternal capacity for mainstreaming gender in its operations. Consultations with stakeholders \nallowed MARD staff to observe and learn about gender-based constraints and needs directly. \nMARD has shown commitment to implementing gender mainstreaming: at the end of 2003 it \nincluded some of the targets identified in the gender strategy in its planning and policy; and \nsome gender perspectives have been included in the curriculum of the Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment Management School I under MARD. The major challenge ahead is how to realize \nthe  thrusts  of  the  gender  strategy  by  taking  the  actions  stipulated  in  the  plan  of  action \nsystematically, taking into account the entire institutional context.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The purpose of the TA is to support the Government to achieve the overall objective of \nthe plan of action: to integrate gender into MARD\u2019s plans, programs, and projects in order to \nachieve gender equality and consequent socioeconomic benefits. More specifically, the TA will \nassist MARD to implement the actions identified under two of the three objectives of the plan of \naction: (i) increase MARD\u2019s commitment to implementing gender equality in developing and \nimproving its agricultural and rural development institutions (objective 1), and (ii) strengthen the \ncapacity of gender mainstreaming for officials and public service providers at all levels of \nMARD-related departments and agencies (objective 2).  \n \n8.   The TA outputs will be (i) MARD\u2019s annual plans with gender-disaggregated targets; (ii) \nthe integration of gender into MARD\u2019s public service provision (contents and delivery); (iii) a \ntraining  framework,  modules,  and  curriculum  for  gender  mainstreaming  geared  to  public \nservants, teachers in MARD-related schools, and service providers; (iv) gender training geared \nto different roles and responsibilities of offices and units; and (v) a network of human resources \nfor gender integration for the programs and projects of MARD across the board.  The TA will \nstrengthen MARD\u2019s gender mainstreaming capacity at the organizational level as a whole, as \nwell as at the departmental level.  \n                                                 \n6  Issued as the Decision of the MARD Minister in October 2003, No. 4776 QD-BNN/TCCB, 28 October 2003. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.   Among  the  three  constraints  on  realizing  gender  equality  and  empowerment  in \nagriculture and rural development discussed above, the TA will focus on institutional constraints. \nThe TA generally follows the steps identified in the plan of action, and will coordinate closely \nwith the ongoing Agriculture Sector Development Program7 and Agriculture Sector Development \nSupport8  which  address  the  constraints  relating  to  recurrent  budget  allocations  to  support \nservices and their implications for the implementation of the gender action plan. The TA will also \ncoordinate closely with the Project Support to the Public Administration Reform Program in \nMARD9 with regard to gender mainstreaming. The TA has four components. \n \n1.  Strengthening Gender-integrated Planning Cycle \n10.  This component aims to support MARD\u2019s commitment to implementing gender equality \nin developing and improving its institutions concerned with agricultural and rural development. In \naccordance with the decree defining the functions and organizational structure of MARD issued \nby the Government in July 2003, and subsequent ministerial decisions defining the functions \nand organizational structure of each of the 18 departments issued in September 2003, the \norganizational structure and procedures and the systems for gender integration in the planning \ncycle will be examined. Emphasis will be placed on clarity of responsibilities and tasks of \ndifferent departments and units with regard to gender mainstreaming and developing gender-\nintegrated planning at each stage of MARD\u2019s planning cycle. Gender issues relating to daily \nwork at department, division, and individual levels will be examined in light of job descriptions \nand  performance  indicators,  which  will  eventually  be  integrated  into  the  planning  cycle.  A \nhandbook on gender mainstreaming in the planning cycle will be issued. \n \n11.  Effective planning will require accurate and updated information on gender relations and \ngender  disparities.  To  date,  some  gender-disaggregated  data  in  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment have been collected and used on a project-by-project basis, but there is no means \nof collecting, storing, analyzing, and monitoring gender-disaggregated data systematically. The \nTA will support the preparation of a detailed plan to establish a gender-disaggregated database \nwith a set of indicators at the Planning and Projections Department. Guidelines on planning and \nmonitoring with gender-disaggregated data will be issued for use by staff.  Pilot projects to \ncollect data may be carried out in selected provinces.  \n \n2.  Capacity Building for Gender Mainstreaming  \n12.  This component will strengthen institutional and staff capacity to mainstream gender in \nkey departments\u2019 scope of work, based on their functions and organizational responsibilities. \nGender  training  will  cover  technical  and  professional  subjects  (e.g.,  the  role  of  gender  in \nlivestock,  forestry,  irrigation,  and  water  management);  gender  analysis  and  planning;  and \ngender issues in management and leadership.  As a number of gender training materials have \nalready been developed at MARD, these will be compiled and consolidated to form the basis of \nstandardized modules, which can be modified to serve specific training needs, in accordance \nwith the mandate, functions, and organizational structure of each department.  The training and \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2002.

Technical and professional training will \nfocus on the staff. Activities will include training needs assessment, development of training \nframeworks and modules, pilot-testing of modules, and training of trainers.   \n \n13.  The TA will strengthen the institutional capacity of Agriculture and Rural Development \nManagement Schools I and II under MARD, which train civil servants, specialists, and managers \nof cooperatives and agricultural enterprises. Some of the training courses are unsystematic, \nscattered, and not standardized. The TA will help revise training content, methods, and the \ncurriculum to cater to the emerging needs and demands of MARD departments, and to improve \nlecturers\u2019 training methods.  The skills of the lecturers will be strengthened so they can make full \nuse of the new curriculum and teaching methods.  \n \n14.  To promote sustainable rural development and effective delivery of services to rural \nhouseholds, the TA will support the establishment of gender-sensitive extension services and \nalternative means of service delivery. Under this subcomponent, extension service materials will \nbe  reviewed  and  extension  modules  for  gender  integration  developed,  using  innovative \napproaches. The National Agriculture Extension Center will organize training of trainers for \nextension  service  providers  in  selected  provinces. The TA  will  coordinate  closely  with  the \nAgriculture  Sector  Development  Program  in  assessing the  effectiveness  of  overall  support \nservice  delivery,  including  budget  and  human  resource  constraints  across  MARD  and \nDepartment  of  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development,  particularly  those  affecting  women \nagricultural extension workers. \n \n3.  Gender Mainstreaming in ADB Projects \n15.  This component will facilitate and ensure gender mainstreaming in a number of ADB-\nassisted projects10 and pilot-test the gender training and agricultural extension service modules \ndeveloped under component 2. The staff trained under the capacity-building component will \nidentify  project-specific  gender  issues  in  consultation  with  project  staff.  They  will  develop \ngender-mainstreaming objectives and targets under the projects and monitor activities. Periodic \nmeetings will be held to review progress. Emphasis will be placed on gender capacity building at \ndistrict and commune levels in the project areas, including the training of agricultural extension \nworkers. Alternative ways of delivering extension services will be explored. Through these \nexercises, a critical mass of people with gender analysis and planning skills will be developed \nwithin MARD, through \u201clearning by doing.\u201d   \n \n4.  Evaluation of Plan of Action  \n16.  The plan of action covers the actions to be taken up to 2005.  It will be timely for the TA \nto evaluate the effectiveness of the plan of action, as the TA will be completed several months \nafter the plan of action period.  The TA will develop a framework for assessment and analyze \nhow objectives are met and outputs produced, and if not, why not. The evaluation will also take \ninto account assistance and support to MARD, particularly the Project Support to the Public \n                                                 \n10 Including, but are not limited to ADB. 2001.

Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $315,000 equivalent, of which $123,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $192,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $250,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$127,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the  \nGender and Development Cooperation Fund, to be administered by ADB.  The Government will \nfinance the  balance  of  the  local  currency  cost,  equivalent  to  $65,000  in  kind  through the \nprovision of counterpart and support staff, office accommodation, and other related services and \nfacilities. Cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MARD will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The chairperson of CFAW-MARD will be \nthe TA director and will be responsible for day-to-day TA implementation. A TA coordination \ncommittee with representatives from key departments and offices of MARD will be formed to \nmonitor and provide technical support to the TA activities. The coordination committee will be \nchaired  by  the  vice  chairperson,  CFAW-MARD.  The  coordination  committee  members  will \nensure  effective  coordination  between  the  TA  and  the  departments  or  offices  concerned. \nInformation on members and draft outline terms of reference for the coordination committee are \nin  Appendix  3.    The  composition,  terms  of  reference,  and  detailed  work  program  of  the \ncoordination committee will be discussed and finalized at the beginning of the TA.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from May 2005 to April 2006, and will \nrequire 26 person-months of consulting services: 6 person-months of international consulting \nservices  and  20  person-months  of  domestic  consulting  services.  The  consultants  will  be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its Guidelines  on  the  Use  of Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill  be  recruited  as  individuals.  Appendix  4  gives  the  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the \nconsultants. The consultants  will  submit  inception,  interim,  and final reports,  and quarterly \nprogress reports to ADB. Equipment for the TA will be financed by ADB in accordance with ADB  \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n 20.  A participatory approach is an integral part of the TA. The coordination committee will \nensure that the work program and activities will be developed through a consultative process. \nThe TA outputs will be disseminated through the coordination committee to the entire MARD.  \nTA inception, review, and final meetings will be organized with stakeholders. The outcomes and \nlessons learned will be posted on the ADB gender and development Web site. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
