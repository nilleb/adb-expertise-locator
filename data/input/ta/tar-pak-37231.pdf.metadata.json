The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has requested a project preparatory technical \nassistance (TA) grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support the improvement of \nirrigated agriculture in Punjab.1 The TA was included in the Pakistan Country Strategy and Program \nUpdate2 for 2004. An ADB fact-finding Mission in Punjab from 19 February to 8 March 2005 visited \nthe Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) system. The TA is based on extensive consultations with the \ngovernments of Pakistan and Punjab, farmer organizations (FOs), farmers, development partners, \nand other stakeholders, and the TA\u2019s contents have been confirmed by the government of Punjab. \nThe TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Irrigated Agriculture in Punjab. In Punjab, as in all Pakistan, improving the productivity of \nirrigated agriculture is necessary to stimulate economic growth and reduce rural poverty since 80% of \nPunjab's poor live in rural areas. Agriculture directly employs 40% of the population and contributes \n28% of the total economic output of Punjab. Punjab lies at the center of the Indus Basin link canal \nirrigation system (the world's largest), and has the greatest irrigated area and largest amount of \nirrigation assets in Pakistan. The Punjab Irrigation and Power Department (PIPD) manages vast \ninfrastructure that supports an irrigated area of about 8.5 million hectares (ha), half the area in \nPakistan, and uses 95% of the water resources in Punjab. While development of irrigation and water \nresources has been key factors to Punjab's growth, serious challenges of infrastructure development, \nwater and environmental management, and irrigation governance must be overcome to help irrigated \nagriculture and water management achieve their full potential. \n \n3.  Irrigation Challenges. Much of the link canal system was constructed nearly a century ago. \nThe infrastructure has deteriorated, which has been exacerbated by lack of investment and poor \nmaintenance. Irrigation systems are inefficient in water distribution and pose a safety and security \nrisk  from  failure  of  large  structures.  Management  has  been  plagued  by  gaps  in  planning  and \noperations, antiquated management methods and technology, lack of investment in irrigation and \nPIPD operational capacity, and insufficient monitoring and evaluation (M&E) to assess performance \nand  direct  improvements.  A  centralized  and  bureaucratic  PIPD  has  contributed  to  limited \nresponsiveness, deficient accountability, and inadequate operation and maintenance (O&M) and \nservice delivery. Farmers have played a marginalized role in the management and O&M of irrigation, \nand their needs for more flexible water supply for high-value agriculture are not being met. \n \n4.  Lower Bari Doab Canal. The LBDC irrigation system in central Punjab exemplifies the \nchallenges, complexities, and opportunities of irrigated agriculture within the link canal system. \nLBDC stretches for 200 kilometers, with a command area of about 700,000 ha that is supplied by \nthe  River  Ravi  and  the  link  canal  system.  The  main  barrage  was  constructed  in  1913.  The \nheadworks and main canal structures of LBDC require urgent rehabilitation, replacement, and \nupgrading. The distributary and minor canal network has degraded substantially due to inadequate \nO&M, which disproportionately affects downstream farmers. PIPD has not been able to effectively \ngovern canal operations. As a result, livestock destroy the canals\u2019 shape; influential farmers tamper \nwith the canal; there is patronage in water delivery; and unauthorized structures divert water. Over \nthe last decades, water supply has become more inadequate and unreliable because agriculture \nwithin the command area has been intensifying. The original water allocations were not designed \nto support irrigation over the full command area. \n \n5.  Environment and Groundwater. Farmers have responded to the need for more reliable \nirrigation  within  LBDC  through  extensive  development  of  private  tubewells;  however,  the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 29 November 2004. \n2  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004-2006): Pakistan. Manila.  ", "2   \nrelationship between groundwater, canal water, and drainage is complex and poses management \nchallenges and environmental risks. Groundwater serves as a flexible supply for irrigation during \ncritical growth periods, and tubewell water may account from a third to over half the crop water \nrequirements in some areas. If farmers do not own pumps, most of them purchase tubewell water. \nGroundwater depth, quality, and availability vary and are partly a result of canal seepage and \ntraditional flood irrigation. Some areas have brackish or sodic water, which if used extensively, \nresults in serious soil productivity decline and eventual ruin. This environmental damage has \nalready occurred in some areas.3 Farmers are aware of the problem, yet some are forced to pump \ndue to the overwhelming need for water. Groundwater management is also needed to prevent \noverdraft. Currently, no regulatory framework, monitoring, or enforcement is in place. Management \nof drainage, groundwater, surface water, and land resources requires an integrated approach from \nthe farmers\u2019 fields to the aquifer.  \n \n6.  Agriculture in Punjab and LBDC. Although agricultural production and cropping have \nintensified, yields have been declining and rural poverty has been increasing in Punjab.4 In addition \nto irrigation, water resources, and land management challenges, other factors contribute to low \nagricultural productivity: the need for improved seeds; sub-optimal use of fertilizer; inadequate \nplant  protection;  credit;  and  limited  farmer  exposure  to  improved  agricultural  practices,  farm \nresearch, and alternative irrigation methods. Extension activities by the Punjab Department of \nAgriculture are often inappropriate for local conditions and market opportunities. In many cases, \nthe  private  sector  provides  necessary  inputs  and  markets,  but  linkages  with  farmers  need \nstrengthening. Crops in LBDC are still dominated by lower value cotton, wheat, maize, and fodder. \nLBDC, like much of Punjab, has excellent potential and some farmers are successfully engaged in \nhigher value agriculture comprising fruits, vegetables, floriculture, livestock, and dairy. An important \nobjective for irrigated agriculture in Punjab is to support a shift to higher value crops, which \nrequires improved agricultural assistance to farmers. \n \n7.  Institutional  Reforms  and  Moving  Forward.  An  essential  element  to  improve  the \nperformance of irrigated agriculture is to deepen the reforms started under the National Drainage \nProgram (NDP).5 As part of NDP reforms, FOs are formed to manage minor and distributary \ncanals. The FOs are the building blocks for area water boards (AWBs) and the Provincial Irrigation \nand Drainage Authority (PIDA), which represent farmers\u2019 interests at the system and provincial \nlevels,  respectively.  To  date,  FOs\u2019  development  has  been  weak,  participation  in  system \nrehabilitation has been negligible, and their role should be expanded to include drainage and \ngroundwater management. PIPD must also reassess its role and support a new approach to \nirrigated agriculture. PIPD has responded with the Water Sector Vision and Strategic Action Plan \nwith the following framework: (i) implement structural measures for optimal utilization of surface \nwater resources; (ii) increase public investments for modernization; (iii) develop holistic approaches \nto the use of surface water and groundwater to enhance productivity; (iv) reverse environmental \ndegradation and groundwater mining; and (v) introduce institutional reforms aimed at transparency, \nefficiency, and autonomy to sustain the resource base and infrastructure. While Punjab has made \na promising start and commitment to reform, assistance is needed to deepen and implement the \nreform process. \n \n8.  Sector Activities and External Assistance. ADB has a long history of investment in the \nwater sector, with over $1.5 billion in projects for irrigation, watershed management, and flood \nprotection.  ADB\u2019s investment in  water  resources and irrigated  agriculture  waned  over  the past \n                                                 \n3  Drainage also plays an important role in managing salinity and needs to be addressed in some areas. Appropriate \npesticide, herbicide, and fertilizer use is also critical to managing environmental sustainability of land resources. \n4   Soil degradation and limited water supplies due to more intensive farming are the causes of declining yields.  \n5  The NDP was a joint irrigation and drainage program of ADB, World Bank, and Japan Bank for International \nCooperation that originally totaled about $750 million in combined funds from all financiers. ", "  3\ndecade due to concerns with project performance and the pace of reforms. However, important \nchanges  have  taken  place  following  completion  of  the  ADB-supported  National  Water  Sector \nStrategy in 2003.  The  Government has shown strong support for  water sector reform through \nintroduction  of  a  draft  national  water  policy  (NWP)  that  provides  a  strengthened  institutional \nframework and is consistent with ADB\u2019s Water Policy. The Government has also requested ADB \nassistance for capacity development, institutional strengthening, and implementation of the draft \nNWP. ADB responded with advisory TA 4435 PAK: Irrigation Water Sector Development6 that will \nprovide a road map for irrigation reform and prepare a substantial assistance program to strengthen \nwater sector capacity and implement the new NWP. The Government plans to use at least $4 million \nfrom  the  ADB  Loan  2178-PAK:  Technical  Assistance  Loan  for  Infrastructure  Development  to \nimplement the TA program prepared under TA 4435 PAK. This strong Government support for \nreform along with Punjab\u2019s own commitment to irrigation reforms provide a solid basis for renewed \nADB support to water resources and irrigation.7 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The overall goal is to improve rural livelihoods and reduce rural poverty through improved \nirrigation service delivery, enhanced agricultural practices, and strengthened water resources and \nenvironmental management to increase the productivity of irrigated agriculture in Punjab. The TA \nand the ensuing project have the following interrelated objectives: (i) improve water resources \nmanagement at all levels in LBDC, (ii) strengthen capacity and institutional frameworks to manage \nirrigated agriculture and water resources for improved productivity and enhanced environmental \nsustainability, (iii) rehabilitate and modernize irrigation and water resources infrastructure and \nstimulate sustainable O&M, and (iv) enhance the enabling environment for improved agricultural \nproductivity. The TA will prepare a sector investment program that includes the following: studies \nand  plans  for  civil  works,  institutional  frameworks,  implementation  arrangements,  capacity \ndevelopment programs, service delivery mechanisms, and M&E and safeguard procedures. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  takes  an  integrated  approach  since  all  activities  must  work  synergistically  to \noptimize water resources management and maximize agricultural production and farm incomes. \nThe following principles will guide TA and project development: (i) the entire irrigation system must \nbe improved in unison to ensure that water entering the main canal provides benefits at the farm \nlevel; (ii) canal flows, groundwater, and drainage must be managed together to improve irrigation, \nproductivity, and the environment; (iii) groundwater use must be sustainable and improved canal \nflows  should  be  for  existing,  not new  irrigation;  (iv)  agricultural  support  services,  inputs,  and \nmarkets must be strengthened to help farmers take advantage of improved irrigation; and (v) \ninstitutions  must  be  reformed  and  strengthened  in  parallel  with  infrastructure  rehabilitation  to \nimprove management and sustain O&M. The TA and ensuing project will provide a model of best \npractice for irrigation modernization and reformed management practices in the link canal system \nas well as for ADB\u2019s pipeline of forthcoming irrigation projects in Pakistan. The TA and the ensuing \nproject will be based on the forthcoming components. \n \n11.  Component 1: Balloki Barrage, Headworks, and the LBDC Main Canal. The TA will \nprepare plans to rehabilitate and modernize Balloki Barrage and all headworks of LBDC to improve \nperformance and reduce the risk of failure. For some of these activities, PIPD has prepared feasibility \nstudies  that  will  be  confirmed  under  the  TA.  The  TA  will  (i)  prepare  for  the  rehabilitation  or \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2004.

", "4   \nreplacement of all structures on the main canal, including bridges, drop structures and branch and \ndistributary head structures; (ii) address rehabilitation of the pumping stations for lift canals and \nimprovement of the emergency escape capacity of the main canal; and (iii) investigate the feasibility \nand financing options for a small hydropower generation facility along the main canal. \n \n12.  Component  2:  LBDC  Branch,  Distributary  and  Minor  Canals,  and  Command  Area \nDevelopment. The TA will evaluate technical options to rehabilitate and upgrade the distribution \nnetwork and review existing flow capacities and needed modifications. It will evaluate alternative \nirrigation technologies to increase water use efficiency and delivery flexibility. A vital TA activity will \nbe  to  define  a  process  that  involves  FOs  in  every  aspect  of  the  minor  and  distributary  canal \nrehabilitation  including  needs  identification,  design,  and  construction  that  can  be  replicated \nthroughout the canal network under the project. The process will assist FOs to develop system \nownership;  increase  understanding  of  O&M;  and  provide  an  opportunity  to  gain  experience \nfunctioning as an organization. The TA will prepare two distributary canal commands as core-\nsubprojects to identify technical requirements and options for rehabilitation and upgrading; define \nprocesses for FOs participation, and provide detailed costing. The TA will evaluate on-farm water \nmanagement  (OFWM)  needs  and  options  for  coordinating  and  strengthening  ongoing  OFWM \nactivities by the district, provincial, and federal governments. \n \n13.  Component 3: Environment, Groundwater, and Drainage. The TA will address LBDC as a \nconjunctive use system for infrastructure and management improvements.8 The TA will support \ndevelopment of models to assess safe yields as well as changes in soil and groundwater properties \nand  environmental  degradation  under  various  scenarios.  The  TA  will  identify  options  for \nenvironmentally  sustainable  conjunctive  use  by  farmers  and  provide  strategies  for  conjunctive \nmanagement that can be incorporated in FO development and training. Recommendations for an \ninstitutional framework to manage overall groundwater within LBDC and applicable to the wider \nPunjab will also be developed. This will also include specifying the necessary monitoring system for \nmanagement and identification of additional data requirements. The TA will assess drainage needs, \nprovide drainage recommendations and options to be implemented by FOs and PIPD. The TA and \nproject  seek  to  manage  water  resources  more  efficiently  to  reduce  groundwater  pumping  and \nenvironmental degradation and to distributing existing surface water more effectively. \n \n14.  Component 4: Agricultural Support Services. The TA will evaluate farmers' needs and \ncurrent delivery of agricultural support services to develop strategies to improve their delivery. The \nTA team will coordinate closely with the Department of Agriculture, the private sector, academic \ninstitutions, and other stakeholders to develop this component for the project. An important element \nof this component is the provision of options that help promote higher value agriculture in LBDC. \n \n15.  Component  5:  Institutional  Strengthening  and  Capacity  Development.  The  TA  will \nprepare a project that develops FO capacity for irrigation rehabilitation, management, and O&M \nincluding  canal  water,  groundwater,  drainage,  and  land  resources.  The  TA  will  also  identify \nimprovements to refine the existing NDP model for FOs, AWB, and PIDA, and seek innovative \napproaches in the delivery of FO training and provision of ongoing FO technical support. The TA will \ndevelop a plan for restructured PIPD management of LBDC assuming full development of FOs and \nfull modernization of PIPD with staff capacity development and technical upgrades (computers, \nenhanced and communication, among others). The TA will work with PIPD to develop an overall \nmanagement study and long-term plan to strengthen and implement its water sector vision and \nstrategic  action  plan.  The  TA  will  develop  assurance  mechanisms  to  ensure  reforms  are \nimplemented through the project. \n \n                                                 \n8  Conjunctive use is the deliberate and integrated use of both surface water and groundwater to optimize resource use \nand minimize adverse impacts from reliance on a single water source. ", "  5\n16.  The TA will develop an M&E framework for all project activities and identify research needs \nand options to help achieve the project objectives and to support improved decision making. The TA \nwill prepare social and poverty assessments and an initial environmental examination consistent with \nADB\u2019s guidelines, and define procedures and a capacity development program for PIPD, FOs, and \nother  stakeholders  to  continue  these  activities  during  project  implementation  (Appendix  2).  A \nframework for resettlement consistent with ADB\u2019s guidelines will be prepared and used as needed in \nthe ensuing project. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.55 million equivalent, comprising $924,000 in \nforeign exchange and $628,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested that \nADB finance the entire foreign exchange cost and $318,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. \nThe Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $310,000 equivalent. The TA will \nbe financed on grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan for \n$595,000. The TA will be cofinanced by the Government of the Netherlands for $557,000, and the \nCooperation  Fund  for  the  Water  Sector  for  $90,000  administered  by  ADB.  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing are in Appendix 3. The Government has been advised that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to financing an ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  PIPD will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the TA and has agreed to the \nfollowing: (i) to appoint a TA project director and counterpart staff; (ii) to create a project management \nunit  to  facilitate  TA  implementation;  (iii)  to  provide  data  and  information;  (iv)  to  facilitate  two \nconsultative stakeholder workshops (in Lahore and in the command area) to discuss the TA; and (v) \nto provide logistical support, lodging in field guest houses, office space, phone lines as needed, and \nutilities. Two committees will be formed: (i) a secretary-level steering committee for policy guidance \nchaired by the Chairman of the Punjab Planning and Development Board; and (ii) a project technical \nadvisory committee to assist implementation and interagency coordination chaired by the project \ndirector and comprising of technical officers. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months, from August 2005 to February 2006. Consultants \nwill provide 34 international and 51 domestic person-months of consulting services in engineering, \neconomics, agriculture, institutional development, social assessment, and environment. ADB will \nengage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. A simplified technical proposal \nwill be used and selection will be quality- and cost-based. The farming systems analysis/sustainable \nagriculture specialist will be recruited on an individual basis. Advance action will be taken to recruit \nthe consultants on a noncommittal basis. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering  a  portion  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $90,000  to  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector; (ii) ADB administering a \nportion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $557,000 to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of the Netherlands; and (iii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the \nequivalent of $595,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of Pakistan for preparing the Punjab \nIrrigated Agriculture Development Sector Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/ Reporting  Assumptions  \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nImprove rural livelihoods  Improved livelihood  District data in Punjab for rural  1.

Ahead, states: \u201cThe most critical challenge \n  facing the agricultural sector is the shortage \nof water as it is the key engine of \nagricultural growth.\u201d The strategy paper also \nrecognizes the importance of improved \nwater delivery and efficiency, water pricing \nand cost recovery, rehabilitation and \nmodernization of infrastructure, and the \nneed for improved governance and \noperation and maintenance of irrigation \nfacilities.  The paper specifically calls for \ndecentralized and participatory irrigation \nmanagement reforms that will be supported \nby the TA and ensuing project. \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Pakistan: \nWater resources are vital to Pakistan\u2019s economic well-being and their improved management is vital for poverty \nreduction. Agriculture contributes 26% to Pakistan\u2019s gross domestic product, employs 54% of the labor force, and \ndirectly or indirectly provides 60-70% of exports. Development of water resources in the Indus Basin for irrigated \nagriculture has been a key source of agricultural and economic growth, and irrigated land is responsible for about 80% \nof agricultural production in Pakistan. Irrigation uses 95% of all developed water supply to support agriculture on about \n19 million hectares of land or about 82% of the irrigable area. In Punjab as in Pakistan, improving the productivity of \nirrigated agriculture is necessary to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty. Agriculture directly employs 40% \nof the population and contributes 28% of the total economic output of Punjab. Punjab lies at the center of the Indus \nBasin link canal irrigation system and has the largest area of irrigated agriculture in Pakistan \u2013 about 8.5 million \nhectares, almost half the irrigated area in the country. \n \nAccording to the Punjab Economic Report (Towards a Medium-Term Development Strategy, June 14, 2004, \nGovernment of Punjab, World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and Department for International Development), \npoverty in Punjab had increased to 34.1% by 2001/02. The incidence of poverty is much higher in rural Punjab, with \nalmost 80% of the poorest 10% residing in rural areas. According to this report, the poorest 10% of Punjab consume \njust below PRs400 per capita per month. Vulnerability defined as proximity to the poverty line is at 77.7%. These \npeople are vulnerable to even small shocks to their income, and all individuals in this group risk experiencing poverty if \nhit by a shock. Accordingly improved productivity, environmental sustainability, and livelihood opportunities from \nirrigated agriculture are essential to poverty reduction in Pakistan and Punjab. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nSocial and stakeholder analyses are needed through focus group discussions as well as limited household survey \nwork in Lower Bari Doab Canal (LBDC) with more extensive efforts in the command areas of the two distributary \ncanals that will be prepared as core subprojects. Stratified procedures should be used to ensure desegregation of data \nbetween head, middle, and tail reaches of canal commands as well as among land tenure arrangements for farm \nfamilies. Livelihoods impacts should also be assessed in areas where environmental soil degradation is more acute \nand in areas where irrigation canal conditions are particularly poor. The assessment would be in addition to other \ndistributional assessment in standard ADB poverty assessment including gender. Baseline conditions should be \nestablished in all stratified areas to ensure that program monitoring and evaluation can reflect impacts to different \ngroups. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 2  11\n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nA stakeholder analysis and participation strategy will be undertaken for needs assessment and targeting of the poorest \nareas and groups, including women. \n \nSince a vital objective of the TA and the ensuing project will be to empower farmers through development of farmer \norganizations (FOs), a formal strategy for farmers to strengthen and implement participation will be an important TA \noutput. \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nWomen bear a disproportionately higher burden of poverty. District and village studies show that women constitute \n42% of the economically active persons in agriculture, and are major contributors to the rural economy through crop \nproduction, livestock production, and cottage industry. A study of 42 villages of the Punjab showed that women play a \nvital role in agriculture production, manufacture of off-farm products, performing household tasks, caring for children, \ncooking and carrying fuel and water.   \n \nGender discrimination in access to markets, institutions, and resources constrains women from overcoming poverty, \nand the prevailing gender norms within traditional households further exclude them from availing of the limited market \nopportunities. Poor women suffer from the double burden of poverty and the gender bias against them in social and \neconomic life. Due to restrictions on mobility, they have poorer access to education, skills training, health facilities, and \nlabor markets. A recent study showed that, while they contribute substantially (16\u201325%) to family income, their control \nover intrahousehold consumption decisions is relatively restricted. Another study of rural region of Punjab has shown \nthat while women are predominantly employed in agriculture and livestock, their work is unpaid in a large proportion of \ncases. The percentage of unpaid farm labor for women is as high as 57% in areas where water is scarce, falls sharply \nto 17.3% in semi-irrigated areas, and further to 13% in the irrigated areas of Southern Punjab. This is attributed to the \nfact that given the low yield per acre in water-scarce areas, men traditionally seek employment outside, while women \nwork on the family farm. In irrigated areas, women are traditionally hired for the more labor-intensive activities of \ncotton picking and vegetable weeding, and the return is far below the subsistence level. According to this study, paid \nemployment outside the home, is mainly undertaken by women from low-income households, which for economic \nreasons cannot afford to observe seclusion norms.  \n \nGender analysis will be undertaken and is specifically addressed in the TA terms of reference and development of a \ngender strategy will be an important part of the TA. This is especially important given the current status of women in \nPakistan.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.
