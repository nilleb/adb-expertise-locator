The  United  Nations  Economic  and  Social  Commission  for  Asia  and  the  Pacific \n(UNESCAP) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly produced the first \nregional Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Report for the Asia-Pacific Region in 2003 \n(MDG Report I).1 The Asian Development Bank (ADB) was not formally associated with MDG \nReport I. Although ADB was invited and participated in the advisory committee, it provided no \nfunding support for preparing the report. After the first regional report was published, both \nUNESCAP and UNDP expressed the feeling that ADB\u2019s partnership with the United Nations \n(UN)  agencies  on  the  achievement  of  the  MDGs  would  strengthen  the  regional  effort  in \nfurthering the MDG agenda in the region. A formal request for ADB to participate in a regional \npartnership on the MDGs was made in January 2004, and ADB formally agreed to participate in \nthe tripartite partnership, through technical assistance (TA) provided over three phases between \n2004 and 2008 involving, among others, preparation of joint regional reports on MDGs in 2005 \n(MDG Report II) and 2007 (MDG Report III), technical papers, and active dissemination of \nmessages from these outputs to stakeholders in the region to support efforts to achieve the \nMDGs.  \n \n2.  The first phase TA for $350,000 was approved on 4 November 2004. Its main output \nwas  the  preparation  of  joint  MDG  Report  II  entitled  A  Future  Within  Reach:  Reshaping \nInstitutions in a Region of Disparity to Meet the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the \nPacific. The report was launched jointly by the three partner institutions at a high-level event at \nADB headquarters on 7 September 2005 and again at a UN General Assembly Session side \nevent in New York on 13 September 2005. In addition, several technical papers on separate \ntopics are being finalized as part of the TA.  \n \n3.  The second phase TA is intended to build on the outputs of the first phase, further \nadvancing regional efforts on achievement of the MDGs and taking steps for preparing MDG \nreport III. The TA design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) summarizes the main aspects \nof the second phase TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The UN  General Assembly adopted the Millennium Declaration in September 2000 \ndefining the MDGs and marking the overwhelming consensus of the international community at \nthe beginning of the millennium to achieve a rapid reduction in poverty in all its dimensions by \n2015. Joining this global effort, ADB\u2019s enhanced poverty reduction strategy (PRS) resulting from \nthe PRS Review of 2004 strongly emphasizes the achievement of the MDGs and makes the \nattainment of the MDGs in the region ADB\u2019s long-term objective, on the basis of which the \noverall impact of its operations will be measured. Thus, ADB\u2019s annual report on implementation \nof the PRS, which monitors and assesses ADB\u2019s overall development effectiveness and is a key \nelement of the Managing for Development Results initiative, uses the MDGs to monitor ADB\u2019s \noverall impact on poverty reduction in the region. \n \n5.  A global stocktaking exercise was conducted in 2005 on progress on the MDGs since \nthe 2000 Declaration. The process culminated in the UN Summit Meeting of world leaders on \n14\u201316 September 2005 as part of the 60th Session of the UN General Assembly. The meeting \n                                                 \n1 United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and United Nations Development \nProgramme. 2003. Promoting the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific: Meeting the Challenges \nof Poverty Reduction. Bangkok. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 26 May 2005.  \n ", "2   \ndiscussed progress on the MDGs and further steps needed for their achievement, strongly \nreiterated  members\u2019  unanimous  support  for  the  MDGs,  and  agreed  to  a  number  of  steps \nincluding stepping up assistance by developed countries and improved governance and other \nmeasures for more effective use of assistance by developing countries. However, the immediate \nfocus of international attention is more on Sub-Saharan Africa where a number of measures of \nassistance are planned including debt relief for highly indebted poor countries (HIPC).3    \n \n6.  The joint MDG Report II prepared by ADB/UNDP/UNESCAP was intended to draw the \nworld\u2019s attention to the magnitude of the problems faced by the Asia and Pacific region also, \nwhich faces deprivations in many cases much larger in absolute numbers than those of Sub-\nSaharan Africa; and to galvanize regional and country efforts toward achieving the MDGs.4 \nLooking at the latest available data, the report notes that despite the region\u2019s rapid progress on \nseveral MDGs, not all countries are making sufficient progress and none are currently on track \nto meet all the goals. Although the region has made dramatic progress on the income poverty \ntarget, its achievements on several of the nonincome poverty-related MDGs\u2014particularly infant \nand child mortality, maternal mortality, rural water supply, and enrollment in primary education\u2014\nhave not been satisfactory. The report also identifies 19 countries of greatest concern becasue \nof insufficient progress on these indicators. Apart from focusing attention on the most urgent \ntasks and the countries lagging most behind and need to be supported, the report emphasizes \nthe need to reshape institutions to better address service delivery for achieving the MDGs at the \nnational and local government levels; and also the need for strengthening regional cooperation \ninstitutions for achieving the MDGs.   \n \n7.  The two regional reports along with the series of technical papers5 on different aspects \nof the MDGs that are part of the joint partnership between ADB, UNDP and UNESCAP will help \nfocus global attention on the regional issues facing attainment of the MDGs as well as help \ngalvanize national and regional efforts. Toward that end, the second report was launched \nthrough two high-level events in September 2005: at ADB headquarters in Manila, and as a side \nevent just prior to the UN Summit Meeting in New York. In his address at the UN Summit \nmeeting,6 the ADB President also highlighted the regional challenges facing the achievement of \nthe MDGs. A number of other notable events that have been supported by ADB building up to \nthe Summit meeting included a high-level regional conference in Tokyo, Japan, on the health-\nrelated  MDGs  in  June  2005;  and  a  ministerial-level  meeting  in  August  2005  in  Jakarta, \nIndonesia,  which  adopted  a  declaration  by  countries  and  stakeholders  in  the  region  for \naccelerating progress on the MDGs.7   \n \n8.  However, to keep up the momentum that has been generated on the MDGs beyond \n2005, considerable effort will be needed so that all stakeholders continue to strive toward \nachieving  the  MDGs  in  the  remaining  years  to  2015.    The  efforts  will  require  continuing \ndissemination activities on the report and its proposed 2006 update and the technical papers \nthat need to be prepared on the areas of concern identified in the second regional report, and \n                                                 \n3  The  conclusions  of  the  Summit  are  contained  in  the  outcome  document,  which  can  be  accessed  at  \nhttp://daccessdds.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/N05/511/30/PDF/N0551130.pdf?OpenElement  \n4 The Millennium Project commissioned by the UN found, for example, that, in 2005, Asia is home to (i) 71 % of the \ntotal number of people in the world without access to improved sanitation, (ii) 58 % of those without access to safe \nwater, (iii) 56 % of the world\u2019s undernourished, (iv) 54 % of those living in slums, and (v) accounts for 43 % of the \nworld\u2019s child mortality. \n5 The technical papers that are currently being prepared for joint publication include papers on the water sector, on \ngender, and a paper examining the special issues facing the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation  \nmember countries.   \n6 The President\u2019s address may be seen in text at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Speeches/2005/ms2005067.asp .  \n7 See the Jakarta Declaration at http://www.undp.or.id/archives/pressrelease/MDG_RMM_Jakarta_Declaration.pdf  \n ", "  3\njoint dialogue by ADB and the UN agencies with governments of the region and stakeholders on \nissues relating to attainment of the MDGs.   \n \n9.  Continued  focused  work  on  special  issues  arising  in  tackling  the  areas  of  concern \nidentified in the report is also necessary. For example, the health indicators in the region are \nparticularly worrisome. Health improvements require complex interventions simultaneously in \nseveral areas apart from augmented investments in primary health care.8 The issues need to be \nstudied, solutions for consideration offered, and good practices that have worked elsewhere \nhighlighted. The technical paper series that has begun with MDG Report II will therefore need to \nbe continued.   \n \n10.  The MDG Report II also identified serious data deficiencies on the MDGs.  While a major \neffort was made in the period October 2003-April 2005 prior to preparing MDG Report II to fill \nthe gaps in data, and 33% more data values than available previously were obtained, many \nindicators are still not available for all countries or areas where they would be relevant.9 Thus \nimproving the data set is a high-priority activity and needs to be urgently addressed so that the \nregional MDG report III targeted for preparation in 2007 can more accurately depict progress.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA\u2019s main goal is to establish a better basis for tracking progress on the MDGs by \nstakeholders and make operationally relevant analysis available to them, particularly in the \nsectors of concern and countries of the Asia and Pacific region identified in MDG Report II as \ncurrently at risk of not achieving the MDGs. It is envisaged that regional MDG reports, and the \nbackground and supporting technical papers will be properly disseminated, raise awareness, \nlead to improved policies and institutions, and generate increased resources and capacities for \nattaining the MDGs.  \n \n12.  The main outputs of the phase II TA are (i) improved data on MDGs for preparing the \nthird MDG report (scheduled for 2007); (ii) a regional MDG report update in 2006 and a series of \noperationally relevant technical papers, which will also help in preparing the third MDG report; \nand (iii) dissemination of MDG Report II and its proposed update and technical papers to \nappropriate audiences in developing member countries (DMCs) so that greater awareness is \ncreated,  and  necessary  action  initiated  by  governments  and  all  stakeholders  for  MDG \nattainment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  ADB, UNDP, and UNESCAP will closely monitor the outputs and outcomes (paras. 16\u2013\n17). The data improvement and gap-filling activity will be conducted mainly by UNESCAP in \nconsultation with UNDP and ADB. The MDG report update will be prepared by UNESCAP with \nthe  support  of  UNDP  and  ADB.  The  technical  papers  will  be  contributed  by  all  three \n                                                 \n8 The complexity of the interventions may be seen, as a special example, in the ADB case study on health prepared \nfor the Shanghai Upscaling Conference, which can be accessed at http://www.adb.org/Documents/Papers/Scaling-\nUp/Health-Sector/default.asp  \n9 See MDG Report-II appendix on data availability. Indicators 18, 38, 39, 42, 43, and 46 do not have any data values \nfor any regional member and associate member of UNESCAP. The data series available ranged from 51 \n(Indonesia) to 12 (American Samoa).  Even where data series are available, many have just one data point, which \ncannot be used to estimate trends.  \n ", "4   \norganizations. Dissemination of the documents and policy dialogue will be conducted by all \nthree agencies and coordinated through the ADB resident missions and UNDP country offices. \nAn effective dissemination plan will be developed for this purpose.  \n \n14.  It is envisaged that phase II will tentatively cover the following areas:  \n(i)  Improving data coverage and quality. The major emphasis in phase II will be \non 3 different areas as elaborated in Appendix 2, namely (a) comprehensive \nupdating of data sets and filling in of missing data including using alternative \nnational  data  series  or  those  from  other  agencies  that  are  collected \nsystematically, if they are found reliable; (b) disaggregating data, to the extent \nfeasible, geographically as well as by gender, ethnic group, religious group, age, \nor  other  social-economic  dimensions  to  understand  where  deprivations  are \nhighest and to recommend remedial measures; and (c)  developing an MDG \npolicy database containing a classification of policy measures by type of action \nand information on target groups and number of beneficiaries, as well as on \nexpenditure, to better understand the impact of policies on targets and goals.  In \naddition, studies are planned on two important areas concerning data-related \nmatters,  namely,  testing  the  usefulness  of  certain  indicators  for  monitoring \ntargets and goals with a view to improving/replacing them; and studying the \nlinkages, complementarities, and trade-offs between different targets to focus \naction most efficiently to achieve the MDGs. The overall process is expected to \ncontribute to developing a strengthened partnership between UN agencies, ADB, \nDMCs, and stakeholders working to strengthen MDG-related data at the regional \nlevel.  \n(ii)  MDG report update 2006 and technical studies.  To inform regional policy \nmakers and other stakeholders, an update of the regional MDG report based on \nupdated data collected and including annual highlights and developments will be \nprepared in 2006. In addition, a number of detailed studies on aspects of concern \n[(i) (b)] as well as those identified by MDG Report II including in areas of service \ndelivery and regional cooperation, exploring greater market-driven solutions to \nMDG attainment, and other areas considered important by the three agencies will \nbe  prepared  and  jointly  published.  The  studies  will  be  designed  to  be  of \noperational relevance to policy makers and technical experts in the concerned \nfield and provide ideas on changes necessary to tackle problems encountered. \nThe studies and the findings from them will help also in developing the third joint \nMDG report scheduled for 2007. \n \n(iii)  Dissemination. To ensure that policy makers in the region, aid sources, and \nother stakeholders actually deliberate the issues highlighted in the two MDG \nregional reports and the technical paper series, the three agencies have drawn \nup a dissemination program. The program involves subregional launches and \nside  events  of  MDG  report  II  and  technical  papers,  national  advocacy  and \ncommunication  events,  and  MDG  web-based  dissemination  and  networking. \nDissemination material for various types of media will be prepared, with the help \nof ADB resident missions and UNDP country offices.   \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  Phase II has a total cost of $1,300,000, of which ADB would fund $325,000.  Of this ADB \nfunding, $190,000 will be transferred to UNESCAP for its part of implementation broadly defined \nin para. 13; while $135,000 will be retained by ADB for ADB-led activities. A total of $975,000 \nwill be funded by UNESCAP and UNDP. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.       \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The three-phase TA project is an important collaborative exercise between ADB, UNDP, \nand UNESCAP, which have all given their financial and staff resource commitments to ensure \nquality outputs. A formal memorandum of understanding (MOU) was concluded with UNESCAP \nand UNDP for phase I, defining the roles and responsibilities of the partner agencies to ensure \nsmooth implementation of the project. This arrangement will continue for phase II although a \nseparate MOU will be prepared addressing the specific outputs of this phase. ADB will be the \nExecuting  Agency  for  the  TA  to  be  implemented  by  the  Poverty  Unit  of  Regional  and \nSustainable Development Department, which will coordinate an interdepartmental effort for the \npurpose.  \n \n17.  A high-level steering committee comprising the ADB Vice President for Knowledge \nManagement  and  Sustainable  Development,  UNESCAP  Executive  Secretary,  and  UNDP \nAssistant Administrator for East Asia and the Pacific was set up to provide overall guidance for \nthe project. A working group consisting of representatives at the staff level from the three \norganizations will coordinate the preparation and ensure the quality and timely delivery of \noutputs.  \n \n18.  The phase II TA will engage 11 person-months of consulting services (6 person-\nmonths international, and 5 domestic) for the TA activities directly undertaken by ADB. The \nconsultants to be hired by ADB will be development specialists with experience in the area of \nMDGs (Appendix 4). The consultants will be engaged individually in accordance with ADB\u2019s  \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. \n \n19.  This phase is part of the TA cluster that will run for 4 years altogether in three phases of \n15 months each. The main purpose of phase I was to support the preparation of MDG Report II \nand technical papers. Phase I began on 1 October 2004 and is expected to be completed at the \nend of 2005 (15 months).  Phase II will begin on 1 January 2006 and continue until 31 March \n2007 (15 months). Phase III will focus mainly on MDG report III and its dissemination.  However, \nthe content of phase III will be determined based on the needs and priorities indicated by the \nsteering committee. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $325,000 on a grant basis for \nSupporting the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in the Asia and Pacific \nRegion: Phase II, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved basis for  Improvement in MDG  MDG Indicators based on  \u2022 Governments and other \ntracking progress on  indicators database  UN data   stakeholders continue to \nthe MDGs by  figures in all countries  be committed to achieving \nstakeholders  in the Asia and Pacific  the MDGs. \nestablished, and  region by 2008,   \noperationally relevant  particularly in countries \nanalysis made available  identified as at risk in \nthe MDG II Report  \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nGreater awareness of  Strategies to attain  \u2022 Individual MDG country  \u2022 Countries strongly support \nMDGs in DMCs;  MDGs adopted by  reports  MDG philosophy as \nimproved policies and  governments, and  \u2022 National poverty  reflected in their \ninstitutions for MDG  alignment of policies  reduction strategy  development documents, \nachievement; and  and institutions  documents  policies, and budgets. \nincreased resources  reflected in all national  \u2022 Regional MDG report   \nprioritized for MDGs  poverty reduction  and updates   \nattainment   strategy documents by     \n  2008    Risk \n     \nBudgetary resources  \u2022 Country budgets  \u2022 Economic shocks prevent \nconsistent with targets  sufficient prioritization for \nallocated by countries  MDGs.  \nfor MDGs by 2008    \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

The recently published joint second regional Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \nreport\u2014A Future Within Reach: Reshaping Institutions in a Region of Disparities to Meet the \nMillennium  Development  Goals  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific\u2014has  pointed  to  significant  data \ndeficiencies. To improve the data on MDGs for MDG report III, three main data-related issues \nneed to be addressed.   \n \n2.  Comprehensive  Data  Updating  and  Gap  Filling.  Data  in  the  United  Nations \nDepartment of Economics and Social Affairs (UNDESA) database, which is the primary source \nof MDG-related data, is often outdated. For example, the latest (1999) value for the girls-to-boys \nratio in primary education in Afghanistan is 0.08. The 1990 value for this indicator was 0.55. \nMDG Report II therefore concludes that Afghanistan is regressing from gender parity in primary \neducation. A closer look at the actual current situation, however, suggests that the Government \nof Afghanistan, with assistance from the international community, is addressing the issue with \nthe urgency it deserves. The gender parity ratio is now around 0.54 at all levels of education; \nthe ratio for the primary level probably has surpassed the 1990 value. Rather than regressing, \nAfghanistan, on the present trend, is likely to reach the target by 2015. To increase its relevance, \na mechanism is needed to update the UNDESA database with the latest information available at \nthe national level. Close contact with national statistics offices will be maintained and their \ncooperation sought for this purpose. Use will also be made of work in this area being done \nthrough  other  initiatives  such  as  the  Partnership  in  Development  for  Statistics  in  the  21st \nCentury (PARIS21). In this respect, the ADB country offices, the UN country teams, and the \nSecretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC) can also play a key role in providing the necessary \nmetadata and in ensuring that the new data are reliable. The updated information can be \ndisseminated on a regular basis to the public ahead of and independent from the release of \nforthcoming regional MDG reports.  \n \n3.  Disaggregated Data.  The need for geographically disaggregated data to understand \ntrends at subnational levels has assumed importance. A more fundamental question is what \ndisparities really matter. Are they indeed geographical in nature, or do ethnic, religious, gender, \nage or other social-economic dimensions matter more? To establish the key factors in the MDG \nperformance of different social-economic groups, disaggregated data reflecting attainments by \nsuch  groups  will  be  needed.  Household-level  information  (micro  data)  and  use  of  special \nstatistical techniques for small area estimation1 may be required. To this end, use will be made \nof the regional repository of household surveys that ADB (Economics and Research Department) \nis developing and which is expected to be functional by 2006.   \n \n4.  MDG  Policy  Database.    An  important  question  is  what  determines  the  score  of \ncountries on the specific targets/goals and how to explain the differences between them. During \nthe drafting of MDG Report II, attempts were made to explain the net primary enrollment rate \nand under-5 mortality through panel regression models. Although interesting preliminary insights \nwere obtained, difficulties in data and model specification prevented the derivation of robust \nconclusions. Information on the policy measures that affect (directly or indirectly) the MDG \nperformance  of  each  country  was  insufficient.  An  MDG  policy  database  containing  a \n                                                 \n1 The Economics and Research Department has acquired material on some of these areas through earlier regional \ntechnical assistance work, which will be utilized.  \n ", "Appendix 2  9\nclassification of measures by type of action and information on target groups and number of \nbeneficiaries, as well as on expenditure, should be developed.  \n \n5.  Special Studies.  In addition, data-related studies are also important. An important \nissue is the apparent difference in quality between indicators that relate to a given target or goal. \nGoal 1\u2014eradicate extreme poverty and hunger\u2014for example, consists of two targets and five \nindicators. Preliminary results of ongoing research at the secretariat of the United Nations \nEconomic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific indicate that four of the indicators \ncorrelate strongly with the underlying latent construct poverty and hunger, but that the fifth, the \nproportion of population below minimum level of dietary energy consumption, does not. This \nfinding is not surprising: the four relevant indicators are directly measured at the household level, \nbut the dietary intake indicator is the balance of national food production, apparent consumption, \ntrade, and change in stocks. The implication of a lack of correlation between an indicator and \nthe underlying construct\u2014i.e., target or goal\u2014that it intends to measure is that the indicator is \nredundant for monitoring purposes, and that the time and effort to be spent on it could be better \nutilized elsewhere. A clearer focus on the indicators that really matter is therefore urgently \nneeded. \n \n6.  Another  area  worth  investigating  is  the  possible  complementarities  and  trade-offs \nbetween different targets. MDG Report II finds evidence, for example, that improved access to \nclean water leads to lower child mortality rates. Investment in and expenditure on potable water \nsources therefore contribute not only to the achievement of goal 7, but also of goal 4. On the \nother hand, it is also possible that a reallocation of resources from one target or goal to another \nwill  have  no  effect  on  the  overall  progress  toward  the  MDGs.  Insight  into  the  issue  of \ncomplementarity versus substitution is crucial for decisions on optimal allocation of resources. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \nTotal \nItem \nCost \nA.
