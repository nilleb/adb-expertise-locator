INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management (PPP) is a capacity development \nprogram that supports knowledge products and services in the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS). It is a pioneering program to build the capacities1 of civil servants and to promote \nregional cooperation in the GMS. The PPP has received total funding of $10.95 million since its \ninception in 20032 for the first four phases. It is designed as a continuing project, with each phase \nbuilding on the experiences and lessons of previous phases. \n \n2.  The GMS leadership continues to recognize the PPP as a premier and unique capacity \ndevelopment program making significant contributions. At the 17th GMS Ministerial Meeting in \nAugust 2011 in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the GMS ministers articulated the need for additional \nsupport to be secured for the PPP to extend its reach and quality. The GMS heads of state at \nthe  Fourth  GMS  Summit  in  Nay  Pyi  Daw,  Myanmar  in  December  2011  expressed  great \nsatisfaction and pride that the PPP has remained vibrant and continues to help build needed \nskills  and  capacities  in  the  subregion,  and  that  it  has  improved  academic  and  research \ninstitutions.  At  the  request  of  the  GMS  governments,  a  fifth  phase  of  the  PPP  will  be \nimplemented. The design and monitoring framework of the capacity development technical \nassistance (TA) is in Appendix 1.3 The PPP is an integral component of the GMS human \nresource development strategic framework, and is in the action plan. It is in line with the \nstrategic thrusts of the GMS regional cooperation strategy and program, specifically pillar 3 on \ncapacity-building issues associated with subregional links. The TA is in the pipeline projects for \nnonlending products and services in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) regional cooperation \noperations business plan, 2012\u20132014.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  PPP  has  had  notable  achievements.  Learning  programs  provided  GMS  civil \nservants  with  conceptual  tools  and  frameworks  on  regional  integration,  leadership  and \ndevelopment  management.  These  programs  enhanced  their  skills  in  developing  and \nimplementing  strategic  development  interventions  and  have  contributed  to  capacity \ndevelopment components of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program sectors development \n                                                 \n1  For the purposes of the technical assistance (TA), \u201ccapacities\u201d include knowledge acquisition, skills development, \nnetworking and developing shared vision and values for the GMS. It is not limited to capability which connotes \nskills development. \n2  The PPP had four phases: (i) Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2002. Technical Assistance for the Greater Mekong \nSubregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management. Manila (TA 6056-REG, approved on 25 October, for \n$800,000 as a grant from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund [TASF] with supplementary funding from the \nNew Zealand Agency for International Development [NZAID] of $350,000); (ii) ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for \nthe Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management II. Manila (TA 6237-REG, \napproved on 29 March, for $800,000 as a grant); supplementary funding was provided by NZAID ($850,000), the \nGovernment of France through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ($1,923,000), and the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund ($500,000); (iii) ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for the \nGreater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management III. Manila (TA 6407-REG, approved \nin August, for $1,000,000 as a grant); supplementary funding provided by NZAID ($400,000), the Government of \nFrance through Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (about $900,000), the PRC Regional Cooperation and \nPoverty  Reduction  Fund  ($500,000),  and  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund \n($500,000); and (iv) ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for the Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for \nDevelopment Management IV. Manila (TA 7431-REG approved on 10 December 2009 for $1,400,000 as a grant); \nsupplementary funding provided by the PRC Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund ($500,000), the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund ($500,000), and ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special \nFund (TASF-IV) ($750,000). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 September 2012. \n4  ADB. 2011. Regional Cooperation Operations Business Plan, 2012\u22122014. Manila. \n ", "2  \nwork. To date, 2,057 GMS civil servants have attended 104 PPP learning programs5 organized \nwith 28 capacity development partners (within and outside the GMS). The PPP has supported \nfellowships to prestigious universities. The 47 fellows now constitute the core development \nleaders who are making a difference in the GMS. Seven issues of the Journal of Greater \nMekong  Subregion  Development  Studies,  a  multidisciplinary  peer-reviewed  publication  that \npromotes better understanding of GMS development issues, have been published. The PPP \nresearch program has funded four multicountry research projects (female labor quality, contract \nfarming, financial services in border areas, and cross-border economic zones) in which 14 GMS \ninstitutions have participated\u2014producing four working papers, four policy briefs, and a journal \nspecial issue. The PPP organized seven GMS development dialogues (GDDs)6 attended by 500 \nmulti-stakeholder participants to provide a platform for in-depth discussion of subregional issues \nto enhance policy and decision-making capacities. The PPP also supports learning resource \ncenters (LRCs) in Cambodia and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) with about \n10,000 users and it has organized 18 Leaders Networking for Knowledge alumni events with \n850 participants. A program management and performance monitoring and evaluation system \nhas been set up. A newsletter (Mekong Leaders) is regularly published and a website7  has \nbeen established. \n \n4.  The TA builds on experience and lessons from previous phases. Evaluations conducted \non the PPP include an evaluation study8 by ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluation Department (2008),9 a \nPPP impact assessment study (2008),10 TA completion reports for the first three phases11, and \nan independent assessment study to propose options for the future (July 2012)12. Major lessons \ninclude  the  need  for  (i)  selecting  learning  programs  with  more  sharpened  focus  and \ncustomization that contribute to developing individual civil servants\u2019 capacities to support GMS \ncooperation; (ii) better targeting of participants involved in GMS working groups, programs, and \nprojects;  (iii)  follow-up  and  deepening  programs,  i.e.,  one-off  programs  unlikely  to  lead  to \nsustainable  workplace  behavior;  (iv)  progressively  developing  technical  and  financial \nsustainability; (v) more active roles for GMS institutions (both research and training), despite \ntheir weak capacities, for the PPP to phase out and eventually assume a more facilitative and \nenabling role; (vi) developing a pool of GMS trainers and experts; (vii) GMS learning materials \n(e.g., case studies, manuals, and tool kits); (viii) better synergies and linkages of policy research \nwith learning programs; and (ix) better indicators (baseline and targets) for more results-oriented \ncapacity development. These lessons were taken into account and the TA design includes new \nkey  features:  (i)  customized  regional  cooperation  learning  programs;  (ii) better  targeting  of \n                                                 \n5  Learning programs cover leadership, human resources management, trade policy, regional cooperation and \nintegration, health care financing, e-governance, social protection, project management, public policy, public \nmanagement, public\u2013private partnerships, state reforms, education management, tourism management, labor \nmarkets, cross-border infrastructure management, international negotiations, science, technology and innovation \npolicy, trade facilitation and logistics development, and environment management among other topics. \n 6  GDDs on energy security, climate change, food security, labor migration, corridor towns development, GMS-\nAssociation  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  synergies  and  complementarities  and  on  border  and  cross-border \neconomic zones.  \n7  http://www.adb.org/countries/gms/sector-activities/hrd/phnom-penh-plan-development-management \n8 ADB.  2008.

By 2022, the GMS countries envision a more integrated, prosperous, and equitable \nsubregion. Having achieved a harmonious relationship from 2002\u20132012 and cognizant of the \ndiffering  levels  of  development,  GMS  countries  have  placed  increasing  importance  on \ndeveloping the capacities of the low-income countries of the GMS. The new decade of GMS \ncooperation requires deepened and more focused capacity development of GMS civil servants \nto prepare them for the challenges and complexities by 2022. This will involve the need to learn \nfrom the experiences of other Asian countries and develop their own capacity-building centers \nto improve the skills and knowledge of civil servants.  \n \n6.  Capacity development is central to implementation of the new GMS strategic framework, \n2012\u20132022,13 which  (i)  involves  a  shift  toward  greater  complexity  resulting  from  second \ngeneration  projects,  and  policy  and  institutional  reforms  related  to  software  issues  to \ncomplement  infrastructure  investments;  (ii)  calls  for  increased  emphasis  on  knowledge \ngeneration and management; and (iii) entails linkages across different sectors and multisector \npriorities as well as selectivity and prioritization of focus. Capacity development of GMS civil \nservants will remain relevant and is an urgent need. The global and regional development \nlandscapes require continuous and long-term capacity development interventions. The PPP has \nplayed a key role and it is expected to continue playing a critical role in providing capacity \ndevelopment interventions for successful implementation of the new GMS strategic framework. \n \n7.  The key development issues to be addressed by the PPP under this new phase are \n(i) the need to improve the capacities of GMS civil servants to design, implement, and evaluate \nmultisector  development  interventions  (strategies,  policies,  programs,  and  projects)  and  to \neffectively take advantage of the benefits and mitigate the risks of regional integration and \ncooperation; (ii) weak subregional  institutional capacity development for sustainability; (iii) weak \nlinks between knowledge generation, acquisition, and policy and project formulation; (iv) the \nneed to improve the research capacities of GMS institutions and research on GMS needs; and \n(v) the GMS countries\u2019 (especially the low-income countries\u2019) lack of human resources and \ninstitutional capacities to benefit from and contribute fully to subregional cooperation. Given \nuneven levels of development and varying experiences in regional cooperation, low-income \ncountries could greatly benefit from the experience of GMS and other Asian middle-income \ncountries, through knowledge and experience sharing. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The expected impact of the TA is that it will contribute to the design and implementation \nof effective and efficient strategies and projects to promote regional cooperation. Its intended \noutcome is for GMS civil servants to apply acquired knowledge and skills set in the workplace. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  Five outputs are envisaged for the TA, with the following key activities. \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 2011.

Output 1: GMS government officials acquire knowledge and develop skills set. \nSeven GMS learning programs of three types will be offered: (i) leadership and development \nmanagement, (ii) sector-specific, and (iii) transboundary economic corridor development. These \nwill be attended by 210 civil servants. The PPP will also continue offering deepening programs \n(i.e., previous alumni attend). Learning programs designed to help improve the capacities of \nGMS low-income countries will be offered. The PPP will continue implementing strict selection \ncriteria  (with  new  criteria)  and  admission  standards  in  partnership  with  the  GMS  national \nsecretariat. Significant efforts will be devoted to targeting the GMS national secretariat, GMS \nworking groups, and executing agencies involved in GMS programs and projects. \n \n11.  Output 2:  High-quality research on priority GMS development issues accessible \nto GMS civil servants. Activities will include four research projects and research papers, the \npublication of two issues of the Journal of Greater Mekong Subregion Development Studies, \nand  four  electronic  policy-based  publications.  Better  synergies  and  linkages  between  and \namong policy-oriented and action research with PPP activities (such as learning programs, \nGDDs, and alumni events) will be implemented to disseminate research results and develop \ncapacities.  The  research  program  will  build  on  experience  and  will  promote  (i) developing \nmulticountry networks among GMS universities and research centers, (ii) developing the policy \nresearch capacities of local institutions, (iii) generating GMS-specific knowledge products, and \n(iv) improving understanding and linkages between policy makers and research institutions. \n \n12.  Output  3:  Knowledge  dissemination  and  networking  on  GMS  cooperation \nimproved.  Activities  to  be  implemented  include  (i)  two  GDDs;  (ii)  Leaders  Networking  for \nKnowledge alumni events organized in the six GMS countries; (iii) expansion of collections, \ndevelopment of electronic databases, and collaboration with other libraries and institutions in the \nLRCs  in  Cambodia  and  the  Lao  PDR;  (iv)  electronic  PPP  newsletter  (Mekong  Leaders) \nproduction; and (v) PPP website improvement. \n \n13.  Output 4: Improved capacities of GMS institutions for sustainability. Activities will \ninclude annual training of trainers; development of learning materials (such as case studies, \nmanuals, and tool kits); and events among GMS and other Asian education and training centers \nto  reinforce  capacities,  ownership,  networks,  and  cross-country  learning  and  experiences. \nPartnerships will be deepened with more Thai and People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) capacity \ndevelopment partners. The pool of faculty and the resource persons from Asian developing \ncountries will be increased. New modalities will be pursued with the goal of progressively \ndevolving PPP functions to the GMS capacity development institutions. The PPP will work \nclosely and more actively with the Mekong Institute for this purpose. \n \n14.  Output 5:  Effective project management and performance monitoring system. \nActivities will include the organization of steering committee and advisory board meetings, tracer \nstudies (select learning programs), evaluation and gathering of feedback on activities through \nquestionnaires  for  improvement,  and  comprehensive  independent  evaluation.  The  PPP \nestablished an effective monitoring and evaluation system, which includes pre- and post-tests to \nmeasure results at the output level and evaluation questionnaires to measure the quality of \ninputs and activities. Efforts to develop baseline indicators and targets will be improved to be \nmore results-oriented, including measurement of outcome through tracer studies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.25 million, of which $0.75 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV) and $0.50 million by the ", "5 \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. As in previous phases, additional funding sources will be actively \npursued. Supplemental financing will be used to expand the range and scope of activities under \nphase V. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. A steering committee, co-chaired by the \ncountry director of the Thailand Resident Mission and a GMS national coordinator (on a rotation \nbasis), composed of GMS national coordinators and representatives of development partners, \nwill  provide  guidance  for  PPP  activities  and policy  directions.  The PPP  secretariat  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day management of the program. A PPP focal point in each GMS \ncountry, assigned by the respective GMS national secretariats, and focal persons in the ADB \nresident missions will provide logistical and administrative support to the PPP secretariat for the \nconduct activities. Administration of the PPP LRCs previously handled by the PPP secretariat \nwill be turned over to ADB\u2019s resident missions in Cambodia and the Lao PDR for sustainability \nand cost-effectiveness. The LRC collections in the Lao PDR will be donated to the National \nUniversity of Laos, where a GMS\u2013PPP section will be established. Learning programs will be \nconducted through the network of institutional partners. An advisory board will provide strategic \nguidance.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented through individually recruited international and national \nconsultants who will work under the supervision of ADB staff responsible for administering the \nTA. It is anticipated that 8 person-months of international consultancy (intermittent basis) and \n54 person-months of national consultancy will be required for TA implementation. The learning \nprograms will be delivered through both institutions and the direct hiring of resource persons \nwho will serve as faculty for the learning programs. The consultants and resource persons will \nbe engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3. \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Although ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook prohibits expenditures for cultural shows and tours, these \nform part of the learning programs and are integral to the TA. These will be included in the TA \nexpenditures provided they are reasonable in amount and nature. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months commencing in November 2012 and ending \nin  April  2014.  Office  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). On completion of the TA, all equipment will \nbe turned over to the ADB Thailand Resident Mission. Fund utilization arrangements for the \ncofinancing will be on a front-loading basis. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund; \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Greater Mekong Subregion Phnom Penh Plan for Development Management V, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and   \n  Performance Targets and  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nGMS governments  By 2020    Regional cooperation is a \ndesign and implement  Three new subregional  Government  priority in the development \neffective and efficient  strategies and five new  development reports  agenda of the GMS \nstrategies and projects  projects for GMS agreed and    governments. \nto promote  implemented  GMS secretariat and   \nsubregional  sector working group  Risk \ncooperation.  reports  Enabling environment (at \ncountry levels) for policy \nand strategy formulation \nand implementation is \nweak. \nOutcome  By 31 May 2014    Assumption \nGMS civil servants  70% of GMS civil servants  Tracer studies  Civil servants have \napply acquired  participating in PPP activities    appropriate incentives to \nknowledge and skill  apply knowledge and skill  Results from the  apply the knowledge and \nsets developed in their  set in their workplace.  comprehensive  skills acquired. \nworkplace.  evaluation report   \nRisk \nSystemic and institutional \nconstraints, and restrictive \npolicies hamper application \nof acquired knowledge and \nskills of GMS civil servants. \nOutputs  By 30 April 2014    Assumption \n1.
