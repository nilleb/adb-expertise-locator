The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been requested by the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to provide technical assistance (TA) supporting the development and \nintegration of regional capital markets. ASEAN\u2019s request focuses on the ASEAN economic \ncommunity (AEC) blueprint,1 specifically in relation to its target of freer capital flows that falls \nunder the objective of creating a single production base. With a view to accelerating capital \nmarkets integration while recognizing the individual circumstances of each member country, an \nimplementation plan should be finalized by the regulators of capital markets, specifically the \nASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), to take measured steps toward adopting harmonized \ncapital markets standards, achieving mutual recognition frameworks, and developing exchange \nalliances. This TA2 will build on these organizations\u2019 recent initiatives and on prior ADB support \nto them. 3 Consultations with the relevant countries and regional bodies noted above were \nundertaken in October 2007 and May 2008, the last of which was with the ACMF at the \nSecurities Commission, Malaysia on 8 May 2008. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Over  the  past  decade,  Southeast  Asian  countries  have  made  substantial  progress  in \nstrengthening financial markets while advancing regional cooperation and integration. Financial \nmarkets have become deeper and more diversified, there is a wider range of products and \nintermediaries, and much has been done to strengthen financial infrastructure. On average, total \nfinancial assets in the banking sector, equity market capitalization, and bonds outstanding, \nrespectively, as percentages of GDP among the ASEAN 5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the \nPhilippines, Singapore, and Thailand) improved from 78.0%, 53.8%, and 22.6% in 1997 to \n112.3%, 99.6%, and 50.7% in 2005. In addition, regulatory and prudential supervision has been \nstrengthened, as has corporate governance, and there is greater recognition of risk issues with \na  corresponding  focus  on  internal  controls,  risk  management  systems,  and  consolidated \nsupervision.  \n \n3.   ADB\u2019s Southeast Asia regional department has helped countries in the region progress \ntoward more robust and diversified financial markets at both the national and regional levels. At \ncountry level, ADB has initiated program loans, projects, and TA. A key objective in country-\nlevel operations is to accelerate convergence to international standards for transparency and \ndisclosure; regulatory principles and practices; trading, clearing and settlement systems; risk \nmanagement; and governance. In addition, ADB has implemented a number of regional TA \n(RETA) projects to complement individual countries\u2019 financial sector initiatives. Studies under \nthe RETA analyzed broad trends in both western capital markets and those in Southeast Asia. \nThey identified the need to develop a strategy promoting greater integration of the latter markets \nwhile enabling those markets to compete more effectively and to benefit from globalization and \ntechnological developments.  \n \n4.  Capital Market Integration. These studies highlight the considerable differences in the \nlevels of national capital markets\u2019 development, including the extents to which they observe \n                                                 \n1  The blueprint, adopted by ASEAN member countries in November 2007, aims to transform ASEAN into a single \nmarket  and  a  more  competitive  economic  region.  It  seeks  more  equitable  economic  development  and  full \nintegration into the global economy. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 18 April 2008. \n3  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Supporting Enhanced Cooperation among Southeast Asian Equity Markets. \nManila (TA 6298-REG, for $500,000).  \n ", "2 \ninternational regulatory and governance standards. All countries have made significant progress \nin improving the depth, trading volume, and openness of their markets. The share of foreign \ninvestors in their national equity markets has grown rapidly, but the number of their listings and \ntheir degrees of openness within ASEAN remain low. The markets generally lag behind more \ndeveloped regions in terms of depth and quality. The markets remain relatively illiquid and have \nhigh trading costs because of their subscale trading volumes. With stiffer competition among \nworld stock exchanges, the emergence of alternative trading networks, and rapid growth in \ntrading volumes internationally, Southeast Asian countries agree that regional integration is \nneeded  to  expand  their  market  capacity  and  scale  so  that  they  can  compete  globally. \nCooperation and integration thus feature as key objectives within ASEAN. Countries expect this \nwill require a continued focus on strengthening and liberalizing domestic capital markets in order \nto build capacity for domestic players to compete effectively and to manage risks.  \n \n5.  In this context, RETA 6298 initiated a consultative process in ASEAN to develop a strategic \nframework for enhanced cooperation in capital markets. It led to consensus on key elements of \na strategy, including steps to support an exchange alliance framework (cross-ownership and \ntrading linkages), and on the need to clarify implementation issues and develop related action \nplans for moving forward. To achieve interlinked capital markets, ADB\u2019s studies highlighted, \namong other factors, the key importance of close coordination between national strategies for \ncapital market development and cooperation between regulatory authorities to bring about a \nmutual recognition framework supported by global standards, such as those of the International \nOrganization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and harmonization of national legal and \nregulatory frameworks. This would serve to address the key impediment to interlinked securities \nmarkets that consists in differences between legal and regulatory frameworks and in regulatory \noversight  of  market  practices.  A sustained  effort  toward  deeper  regulatory  collaboration  in \nASEAN through the ACMF was thus identified as a necessary step toward the objective of \ncapital  market  integration.  In  parallel,  the  ADB-financed  undertaking  led  to  establishing  a \nstrategy working group by the ASEAN stock exchanges in 2007 with a view to achieving single \naccess to one another\u2019s exchanges as the first step toward building an exchange alliance and \ngreater market linkages between them.  \n \n6.   Harmonization  and  Mutual  Recognition.  Further  progress  on  achieving  interlinked \nsecurities markets is critically reliant on measures undertaken by regulators to ease current \nregulatory and other impediments to cross-border financial transactions. In particular, greater \nclarity and progress in harmonizing and mutually recognizing regulations, practices, products, \nand intermediaries are needed in order to facilitate regional integration. Priority areas for mutual \nrecognition and/or harmonization include capital raising through initial public offerings, licensing \nof  collective  investment  schemes,  solvency  of  brokers,  and  qualification  of  investment \nprofessionals. Core regulations and laws for prudential and investor protection purposes in \nthese areas must be harmonized to some degree in parallel with greater mutual recognition \nwhere harmonization appears difficult. Such measures need to be designed with a view to \nenhancing the ability of intermediaries to raise capital\u2014and for investors to invest\u2014anywhere in \nthe region, and ideally from a single access point.  \n \n7.  These objectives are proposed to be realized in the context of the AEC blueprint for 2015 \nthrough its focus on integrating capital markets by means of freer capital flows. The proposal \nwas endorsed by the ASEAN finance ministers at their April 2008 meeting in Hanoi. Thus, a \ncoherent implementation plan is to be drawn up for each of the blueprint\u2019s components. The \nwork of the ASEAN exchanges must also be facilitated to overcome existing regulatory and \nother impediments to cross-border transactions, among other issues. In parallel, strengthened \nobservance of IOSCO principles is viewed as a key national objective for each country in order \n ", "         3 \nto develop deeper and more resilient capital markets. Progress toward achieving common \nstandards, such as the IOSCO principles, facilitates regional harmonization of regulatory and \nlegal frameworks for securities markets and represents an important component of regulatory \ncoordination that is sought in ASEAN. ADB has provided support to help developing member \ncountries  meet  IOSCO  standards  for  sharing  of  information,  and  this  work  needs  to  be \nsustained and expanded to strengthen mutual recognition frameworks in Southeast Asia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the proposed TA is freer flow of capital in Southeast Asia. The outcome of \nthe project will be greater harmonization and broader mutual recognition in Southeast Asian \ncapital markets. The TA has been coordinated with, and will complement, the work undertaken \nby the Office of Regional Economic Integration in Southeast Asia.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.   ASEAN Capital Markets. The TA will assist ACMF to develop an implementation plan \nfor capital market integration that will enhance the abilities (i) for a company in one country to \nraise  financing  in  another  through  wholesale  and/or  retail  markets  in  debt  and/or  equity \nsecurities, (ii) for intermediaries in one country to offer services in another country, and (iii) for \nbrokers and investors to access ASEAN markets from a single entry point of their choice. To \nprovide advice for this purpose, ACMF will form a group of experts drawn from well-known \nnational figures in ASEAN countries knowledgeable in capital market issues. \n \n10.  Based on earlier work and on additional surveys, workshops, and research, the TA will \nsupport the ACMF in developing an implementation plan for an integrated capital market and to \nachieve the AEC blueprint for 2015. The plan will outline a cohesive strategy, identify specific \ninitiatives,  and  establish  clear  milestones.  It  will  encompass  (i)  greater  harmonization  of \nstandards (offerings, disclosure, etc), (ii) mutual recognition of professional qualifications, (iii) \ngreater  flexibility  in  language  and  legal  requirements  for  securities  markets,  (iv)  enhanced \nwithholding tax structure, (v) facilitation of market linkages (including exchange alliances) as \nindicated by the AEC blueprint for 2015, and (vi) a broader mutual recognition framework \nincluding collective investment schemes. The TA will also support the strategy working group to \nimplement  an  exchange  alliance  framework  that  will  assist  in  progressively  analyzing  and \nformulating solutions to achieving closer linkages in trading, marketing, settlement, clearing, and \ndepository systems that underpin equity markets. In addition, the TA will assist Southeast Asian \nsecurities  regulators  to  meet  obligations  under  the  IOSCO  Multilateral  Memorandum  of \nUnderstanding Concerning Consultation and Cooperation and the Exchange of Information \n(MMOU) 4 benchmarks, on the IOSCO self-assessment exercise, and in implementing mutual \nregulatory initiatives that include those of IOSCO\u2019s Asia Pacific Regional Committee and of the \nCapital Market Development Forum (ASEAN).  \n \n                                                 \n4 IOSCO adopted the MMOU in May 2002. Regulators who are able to share public and nonpublic information are \neligible to sign Appendix A of the MMOU, while regulators facing impediments to information sharing are eligible to \nsign Appendix B. For Appendix B signatories, IOSCO will monitor progress in addressing these impediments.  ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $650,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  under  the  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility. It will cover the costs of engaging \nconsultants and preparing reports. The TA will also finance regional workshops and seminars to \ndisseminate its findings, gather views on the feasibility of its proposals, and facilitate agreement \non new initiatives and actions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nNo activity will be financed in any member country under this RETA unless and until a letter of \nno objection, if needed, in respect of such activity has been received from the government of \nsuch member country. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will involve workshops, surveys, \nand reports to support the ACMF in its deliberations. The TA will be implemented over 18 \nmonths, from August 2008 to January 2010.  \n \n13.  ADB  will  recruit  a  firm  to  provide  international  and  national  consulting  services. \nConsulting services will consist of 5 international consultants (15 person-months) and 4 national \nconsultants (10 person-months). The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Single-source \nselection  of  consultants  is  recommended  using  biodata  technical  proposal,  taking  into \nconsideration especially (i) the continuation of work in relation to RETA 6298 carried out by the \nconsulting firm, and (ii) the highly specialized nature of many of the assignments. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. Equipment and office supplies to be \nfinanced by the TA will be procured by the consultants or ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) or other procedures acceptable \nto ADB. Upon completion of the TA, the procured equipment will become the property of ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of the technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 to be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Fund  under  the  Regional \nCooperation and Integration Financing Partnership Facility for Strengthening Southeast Asian \nFinancial Markets, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nFreer flow of capital in  Interlinked Southeast  Reports and statistics by  \u2022  Continued \nSoutheast Asia  Asian capital markets  ASEAN Secretariat,  macroeconomic \n  established by 2015  IOSCO, World Federation  stability  \n  of Exchanges, World  \u2022  Strong national \nIncrease in participating  Bank, International  capital market \ncountries\u2019 cross-border  Monetary Fund, and other  development plans \nportfolio investment from  related agencies   aligned with regional \n$180 billion in 2006 to    integration \n$540 billion in 2015  Reporting Mechanisms:  objectives \n  \u2022  ADB staff  \u2022  Strengthened risk \nIncrease in share of  assessments  control mechanisms \nforeign companies listed  \u2022  TA reports  within intermediaries \nin ASEAN exchanges  \u2022  ADB staff missions,  \u2022  Continued support \nfrom 11.3% in 2007 to  workshops, etc.   from governments \n33% in 2015  \u2022  Various policy and  and private sector \n  legal documents   \nissued by the  Risks \ngovernments, ASEAN  \u2022  Exogenous \nSecretariat, and  economic shocks \nIOSCO  \u2022  Differences in capital \nmarket development \nlimit benefits of \nintegration, hence \nlimit participating \ncountries\u2019 \ncommitment to \nharmonized actions \nand the \nimplementation plan \nOutcome      Assumptions \nGreater harmonization  Policy roadmap for  Reports and statistics by  \u2022  High level support by \nand broader mutual  single access to one  regional stock  ASEAN finance \nrecognition in  another\u2019s markets  exchanges, by members  ministers and \nSoutheast Asian  (\u201csingle passport\u201d)  of ASEAN and IOSCO,  ASEAN Capital \ncapital markets  supported by  and by other related  Markets Forum \n  participating countries by  agencies   \u2022  Close coordination \n  2010, which means (i)    with other \nfor issuers of securities:  ASEAN Secretariat and  international \nonce an issue meets  IOSCO reports  organizations \nprospectus requirements     \nin one country, the  Reporting Mechanisms:   Risks \nsecurities can be sold  \u2022  ADB staff  \u2022  Different views of \nacross the region; (ii) for  assessments  Southeast Asian \nintermediaries: those  \u2022  TA reports  countries on \nincorporated and  \u2022  ADB staff missions,  objectives of, and \nauthorized in one  workshops, etc.   constraints imposed \nmember state to provide  \u2022  Various policy and  by, regional \nfinancial services can do  legal documents  integration  \nso throughout the region  issued by the   \nwithout separate  governments, ASEAN \nauthorization by the  Finance Ministers \nother countries in which  Meeting, ASEAN \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nthey conduct business;  Capital Markets \nand (iii) for investors:  Forum, and IOSCO \neasy access to regional \ncapital markets \n \nIssuance of guidance on \nharmonized standards \nand broader mutual \nrecognition framework \nby 2010 \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

ADB will recruit a firm or institution to provide international and national consulting \nservices. Consulting services will consist of 5 international consultants (15 person-months) and \n4 national consultants (10 person-months).  \n \nA.  International Consultants \n \n2.  Drawing  on  earlier  work  and  on  additional  surveys,  workshops,  and  research,  the \nconsultants  will  support  the  ASEAN  Capital  Markets  Forum  (ACMF)  in  identifying  the  key \nregulatory  areas  requiring  strengthening  and  harmonization  and  in  formulating  an \nimplementation  framework  for  mutual  recognition  to  advance  the  interlinking  of  securities \nmarkets under the Asian Economic Community (AEC) objectives, including those related to the \nemerging  exchange  alliance  framework.  The  implementation  plan  will  be  shaped  by  the \nfollowing guiding principles: (i) greater harmonization of standards relating to issuers, investors, \nand capital market intermediaries; (ii) mutual recognition of products and capital market services \nto  facilitate  the  ability  for  companies  in  one  country  to  raise  financing  in  another  through \nwholesale and/or retail markets using debt and/or equity securities, the ability for intermediaries \nin one country to offer products and services in another country, and the ability for brokers and \ninvestors to access Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) markets from a single \npoint of entry; (iii) greater harmonization in the regional equity market operating environment, \nincluding standardization of trading hours, listing requirements, and other rules; (iv) greater \nflexibility in language and legal requirements for securities markets; (v) enhanced withholding \ntax structure; (vi) facilitation of market linkages through, for example, collaboration and linkages \nbetween  exchanges,  trading  platforms,  clearing  and  settlement  facilities,  and  back  office \nfunctions; (vii) creation of products and services to promote ASEAN as an asset class and an \nattractive  investment  destination;  and  (viii)  promoting  enabling  conditions  to  facilitate \nintraregional flows in the region and recycle regional surplus savings. In particular, consultants \nwill  (i)  provide  assistance  to  ASEAN  Exchange  CEOs  on  exchange  alliances,  (ii)  identify \nportfolio and capital account restrictions that need to be phased out to support exchange \nalliances and market linkages, (iii) propose a sequencing of reforms in these areas, and (iv) \nassist Southeast Asian securities regulators in complying with the International Organization of \nSecurities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  Multilateral  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MMOU)  on \ninformation  exchange.
