INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support research on the role of \nonline platforms in fostering consumer welfare and the resilience and competitiveness of micro, \nsmall, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing \nmember countries (DMCs) in the context of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. \nInnovative approaches will be used to assess the impact of COVID-19 on businesses and \nconsumers as physical supply and logistics chains are disrupted; and how digitalization and online \nplatforms can serve as conduits for economic recovery. \n \n2.  The TA will support pioneering research using big data and machine-learning techniques \nto analyze the role of e-commerce in explaining variations in consumer welfare and business \nresilience before and during the pandemic. Findings will help inform policy recommendations for \nADB\u2019s members. The TA will focus on East and Southeast Asia, specifically on online platforms \nin Indonesia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), with potential applications for the \nPhilippines. It will include research partnerships with online service providers and e-commerce \nplatforms such as Alibaba, GoJek, and Grab Indonesia\u2019s food delivery services. The TA was not \nincluded in the Management-approved work program of ADB\u2019s Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation Department. It was subsequently included in the departmental program as innovative \napproaches to data analysis for real-time, evidence-based policy advice emerged as a priority \nwith the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a source to fund the TA was identified.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Authorities have implemented strict measures to stem the rapid spread of COVID-19, \nincluding  mobility  restrictions. Across the  globe,  public  transport  has  been  suspended  and \nmovement of people has been regulated. These measures have proved effective for many \ncountries  in  containing  infection  rates.  However,  they  have  also  curtailed  production  and \nconsumption. In an environment of limited mobility, digital platforms have provided businesses \nand consumers with the opportunity to transact without physical contact. Some online service \nproviders and platforms, such as Alibaba and GoJek, have facilitated alternative supply chains \nthrough their inclusive ecosystems. E-commerce platforms have allowed producers to continue \nthe production and sale of goods despite disruptions in supply and logistics chains, transportation, \nand physical market access. E-commerce has safeguarded jobs for many. For consumers, it has \nmeant preserving vital access to food, medicine, and other essential goods. These \u201cpush factors\u201d \n(business  incentives  to  seek  alternative  market  access  and  structures)  and  \u201cpull  factors\u201d \n(increased consumer demand for online access to goods and services) have accelerated the \ndigitalization of food delivery systems in the PRC and Indonesia, among other sectors  and \ncountries. The success of online platforms in keeping food supply chains running during the \npandemic  has  underscored  the  value  of  digitalization  in  supporting  resilient  and  inclusive \neconomies. \n \n4.  COVID-19 has revealed that there are fundamental constraints in using conventional \nsurvey data on household consumption, business production, and sales. Big data from private \nplatforms are critical in designing COVID-19 response and recovery policies, unleashing the \npotential of platform economies. Under this TA, collaborations with Alibaba and a broad spectrum \nof domain experts from the PRC and other ADB members will produce cutting edge research. \nThe TA will support an assessment of how digital technology (e.g., for e-commerce, finance, or \nfood delivery) and facilitative platforms such as Alibaba in the PRC, and Grab and GoJek in \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 November 2020. \n ", "2 \nIndonesia can support a more sustainable and inclusive economic development path, improve \nbusiness resilience, and enhance consumer welfare. The research will include empirical analyses \nof the data from these three platforms to capture the impact of COVID-19 on businesses and \nconsumers,  identify  emerging  economic  patterns,  and  develop  potential  policies  and  public \ninterventions to improve post-COVID-19 recovery and growth programs. \n \n5.  ADB and Alibaba Group established a strategic partnership in November 2019 to support \nrural revitalization in the PRC, followed by a cooperation arrangement, by way of an agreement \ndated 25 September 2020 (with Ele.me, a group company in the Alibaba Group that operates a \nfood delivery platform in the PRC), to study the role of digital technology in boosting the resilience \nand sustainability of food supply chains and assess how digital platforms support sustainable \ndevelopment, food security, and waste management in the PRC. A similar research collaboration \nagreement was signed with GoJek on 2 December 2020, and consultations have been ongoing \nwith Grab.2 These arrangements will provide a rare opportunity to better understand the unique \nvalue propositions of online platforms through their \u201cecosystem\u201d approaches (e.g., providing \nbundled  services  such  as  business  development,  financial,  and  logistics  services  to  their \nmembers), and translate these into policy options for DMCs. \n \n6.  The TA is in line with the goals of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (in particular, promoting innovative \ntechnologies and strengthening knowledge services),3 and the digital technology opportunities \nintegrated in ADB\u2019s transformative agenda.4 The TA will contribute to a better understanding of \nwomen-headed  businesses  on  online  platforms  and  policies  for  sustainable,  inclusive \nemployment. It will examine how online platforms can support food security and environmental \nsustainability (e.g., by limiting single-use plastic utensils and packaging, as Beijing and Jakarta \nare implementing). It will support institutional capacity growth and regional initiatives for platform \neconomies  with  knowledge  products  and  services.  This  pioneering  TA  will  combine  high-\nfrequency big data, machine learning, and research partnerships with public (e.g., statistical \nagencies) and private (e.g., e-commerce platform owners and operators) entities to assess the \njuxtaposed impacts of COVID-19 and digitalization on people and economies, and make policy \nrecommendations  to  support the  economic  recovery  and  growth  programs  of  ADB  and  its \nmembers. To facilitate a real-time pathway for evidence-based policy development, TA findings \nwill be shared with internal and external stakeholders via focus group discussions, workshops, \nand conferences cohosted by Alibaba, GoJek, Grab, and the Philippine Competition Commission \n(PCC) during TA implementation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: MSME resilience and consumer welfare during \nshocks (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) enhanced (footnote 3). The TA will have the following \noutcome: DMCs\u2019 understanding and use of optimal policy responses to shocks improved.5 The \n \n2  Several platform owners have been approached for this research, including those with global operations. Among \nthese platforms, Alibaba, GoJek, and Grab have been selected as research partners given (i) the scope and scale \nof their operations, (ii) mutual agreement on research priorities, and (iii) platform owners\u2019 agreement to share their \ndatabanks. \n3  Asian Development Bank. 2018.

Lessons and good practices \nelicited from empirical research will be compiled in policy briefs, journal articles, and research \npapers to inform and support policy options in ADB DMCs. These knowledge products will also \ninform a concurrent research project with PCC and the Asian Development Bank Institute on \ncompetition policy. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Research outputs based on Alibaba data shared with developing member \ncountries. The TA team will use data from Alibaba\u2019s food delivery services to assess role of \ndigital technology in creating resilient supply chains and research the impact of such technology \non consumers and producers during the pandemic in major cities in the PRC. Research will \ndemonstrate  the  importance  of  digital  economy  from  the  perspectives  of  consumers  and \nmerchants, including environmentally conscious programs along food supply chains (e.g., via \nlimiting single-use cutlery in food delivery). Alibaba\u2019s business model, centered on matching and \nfacilitating trade among a diverse network of small and medium-sized enterprises, among others, \nhas proved effective at a time when traditional supply chains have been severely challenged. \nUsing  data  from  Alibaba\u2019s  Local  Life  food  delivery  service,  researchers  will  use  quasi-\nexperimental techniques  to  estimate the change in  MSME  revenue  and  consumer  welfare \nresulting from uptake of digitalization. The TA team will test the hypothesis that business process \ndisruptions  during  the  pandemic  have  pushed  MSMEs  to  join  online  platforms  while \nsimultaneously boosting consumer demand for e-commerce, leading to the expansion of the \ndigital market and benefits for both companies and consumers. The impact of digitalization on \nwomen-headed MSMEs  during  the  pandemic  will  be  explored  in  detail  with  a  view  toward \ndeveloping policy options for inclusive employment and economic recovery. \n \n9.  Output 2: Research outputs based on GoJek and Grab data shared with developing \nmember countries. First, the research team will use real-time granular administrative and \ntransaction data from Grab and GoJek, to track the impact of the pandemic on economic activity \nin large urban and peri-urban areas in Indonesia, as defined by population and volume of \nrespective platform operations. Second, the team will assess the impact of digitalization on MSME \nresilience and consumer welfare during an exogenous shock such as the COVID-19 crisis through \ncohort analyses.6 Key parameters will include changes in MSME revenue, prices, and consumers\u2019 \ncontinued access to goods and services through digital platforms and online transactions. The \nvalue generation potential of the \u201cecosystem\u201d approach adopted by the platforms will be examined, \nin the context of both commercial gains and socioeconomic value, such as broader economic \nopportunities for women-headed MSMEs and MSMEs that employ women workers, and welfare \nimplications for all consumers.  \n \n10.  TA will support analyses with data mining techniques to paint granular pictures of how \nconsumers and companies are coping, with data disaggregated by geographical areas within \ncountries, size of enterprises and other categories. These profiles will enable policymakers to \nbetter understand where pockets of vulnerability are located and to optimize potential policy \nresponses in the future. \n \n \n6  Cohort analysis refers to a form of behavioral analytics where subgroups within a dataset with similar characteristics \nare analyzed over a period of time. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund7 (PRC Fund) and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The PRC Fund will \nfinance operational expenses related to the TA and other eligible initiatives agreed upon by the \nPRC and ADB. It will not be used for permanent staffing costs or to hire staff consultants. It will \nnot cover activities that will involve civil works and in principle it will not be used for large-scale \nequipment procurement. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.
