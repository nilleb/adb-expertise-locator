The Government of Viet Nam views urban and peri-urban development in the region as \na key success factor in achieving the goal of becoming an industrialized country by 2020. \nThanh Hoa City and Thanh Hoa Province, 160 kilometers south of Hanoi, exemplify this synergy, \nwhich is envisaged in the Thanh Hoa Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) for 2006\u20132010. \nAccording to the SEDP, providing the jobs and resources that will reduce poverty and improve \nliving standards depends on business development, increased private investment, and greater \ninternational economic integration. \n2.  During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  for  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  for  the \ndevelopment of a model urban development project in a regional context for Thanh Hoa City \nand  Thanh  Hoa  Province.1  The  PPTA  for  the  proposed  Thanh  Hoa  City  Comprehensive \nSocioeconomic Development Project became part of ADB\u2019s 2007\u20132010 country partnership \nstrategy for Viet Nam.2\n3.  A  joint  fact-finding  mission  of  the  United  Nations  Human  Settlements  Programme \n(UN-HABITAT)3 and ADB4 visited Thanh Hoa and Hanoi from 29 January to 2 February 2007 \nand held initial discussions with representatives of the Thanh Hoa City People\u2019s Committee \n(THCPC) and the Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee (THPPC). The mission did not \nmake a preliminary review of the Project\u2019s environmental, social, and resettlement aspects, \nbecause no project components had been confirmed. But since this is an urban infrastructure \nproject, the project team proposed an initial classification of category A for resettlement, B for \nenvironment, and B for indigenous peoples. A memorandum of understanding (MOU) between \nthe THCPC, THPPC, UN-HABITAT, and ADB was signed on 31 January 2007. The MOU \nreflected the latest findings and agreements reached with the Government on the Project\u2019s \nobjective, impact, outcome, output,5 scope, cost, and implementation arrangements. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Thanh Hoa Province is the most populous province of Viet Nam with 3.6 million people, \nand the fourth-largest in area at 11,116 square kilometers (km2). In this northernmost province \nof Viet Nam\u2019s central region, poverty is high (affecting about 45% of the population) and there is \ngeographic contrast between mountainous areas, where close to one million ethnic minority \npeople  live,  and  coastal  areas  with  key  economic  focal  points\u2014the  provincial  capital,  a \ndeep-sea port, the Nghi Son Special Economic Zone, the coastal resort town of Sam Son, and \nvarious  other  historical  and  cultural  attractions.  The  province  with  its  significant  natural \nresources has strong potential for regional socioeconomic development, and Thanh Hoa City \n(population 300,000), 160 km south of Hanoi along the North\u2013South National Highway 1 and \nconnected on the west to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) via Road 127, is \nstrategically  positioned  as  a  potential  regional  hub.  In  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion, \nThanh Hoa  is  part  of  the  East\u2013West  Transport  Corridor  with  a  new  axis  going  into  the \nnortheastern part of Lao PDR. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 18 June 2007. \n2  ADB. 2006. Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program 2007\u20132010. Manila. \n3  Comprising Dr. Bharat Dahiya, Human Settlement Adviser (Mission Leader), Regional Office for Asia and the \nPacific, Fukuoka, Japan. \n4  Comprising  Hubert  Jenny,  Senior  Urban  Development  Engineer  (Mission  Leader),  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment/Infrastructure  Division  (SEID);  Januar  Hakim,  Urban  Development  Specialist,  Southeast  Asia \nDepartment/Social Sectors Division (SESS); Jeanne Everett, Infrastructure Specialist, SEID; and Hoang Nhat Do, \nProject Implementation Officer, Viet Nam Resident Mission. \n5  The project design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2   \n5.  Thanh Hoa is being held back from full local and regional economic development by \nvarious constraints: (i) rapid population growth, which is worsening poverty particularly in the \nperi-urban areas of Thanh Hoa, where infrastructure investments and services are urgently \nneeded; (ii) an institutional framework that limits new ideas and innovation and the ability of the \ncity and the province to attract private investment; (iii) the limited capacity of the local authorities \nto mobilize the resources needed for development, to provide adequate public information, and \nto manage key public assets; (iv) limited private sector participation in the provision of urban \nservices; (v) aging environmental and other economic infrastructure; and (vi) old or nonexistent \nroad  networks  within  and  between  cities.  On  the  other  hand,  the  strong  ownership  and \ncommitment to reform and openness to new ideas shown by THPPC and THCPC will contribute \nto the development of Thanh Hoa. \n6.  THPPC, THCPC, and ADB view the proposed project as a means of improving the \ninfrastructure in the province and the city, and developing Thanh Hoa into an important regional \neconomic center. The Project will contribute to the development not only of Thanh Hoa City but \nalso of its wider region including, but not limited to, its peri-urban areas, neighboring towns, \nhinterland, and, most importantly, the northern central region of Viet Nam and the northeastern \npart of Lao PDR. Beyond the development of urban infrastructure, the Project addresses the \nkey issues of urban and peri-urban poverty, institutional development, capacity building, and \nmobilization of societal resources particularly from the private sector. In parallel, the Project will \nhelp reduce growing population pressures on larger urban centers like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh \nCity. The PPTA will integrate the important pillars of development identified in the Thanh Hoa \nSEDP, with a view to promoting sustainable economic development and reducing poverty. It will: \n(i) identify key strategic areas for the economic development of the province and the city, given \nthe natural resources and competitive advantages of Thanh Hoa, and evaluate the development \norientation and investment priorities of the province and the city; (ii) promote private sector \nparticipation and regional integration (both domestically and internationally); and (iii) invest in \nthe social and economic infrastructure that Thanh Hoa needs to attract investment and realize \nits full economic potential. New investments by both public and private sectors are expected to \nhelp  increase  employment  opportunities,  generate  income,  and  narrow  the  gaps  in  basic \ninfrastructure. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The  PPTA  will  assist  the  THPPC  and  THCPC  in  (i)  finalizing  the  master  plan  for \nprovincial and regional economic development; (ii) prioritizing investment proposals for the city \nand the province on the basis of their impact on economic growth; and (iii) preparing investment \nproposals for official development assistance, private sector participation, and strengthening of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). With the help of the PPTA, Thanh Hoa City could \nbecome a more competitive, bankable, livable, and sustainable city and meet its target of \nincreasing gross domestic product per capita from $1,000 in 2005 to $1,800 in 2020 and \nupgrading the city status from class II6 in 2004 to class I7 by 2015. The design and monitoring \nframework  is  in  Appendix  1  and  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  in  Appendix 2.\n                                                 \n6  Cities with a population of over 250,000, with these administrative responsibilities: preparing their socioeconomic \nand physical plans; preparing the local budget; allocating and leasing land to households and individuals, and \nissuing land-use certificates; managing handicraft villages; regulating local construction; managing internal road \nnetworks and social infrastructure; and approving investment projects using the state capital budget allocated by \nthe provincial authorities.  \n7  Cities with a population of over 500,000 and with these added administrative responsibilities: planning and \nmanaging infrastructure investment; preparing and managing the implementation of land-use plans; managing \nsmall and medium-sized state-owned enterprises; overseeing the construction and operationalization of industrial \nor processing zones; planning and managing infrastructure development (local transport system, highways, water \nsupply, drainage, and sewerage systems); managing high schools, vocational schools, clinics, and heritage sites; \napproving  state  investment  projects;  licensing  foreign  investment  projects;  allocating  and  leasing  lands  to \norganizations and foreigners; registering non-state enterprises; and approving and managing housing development \nand state-owned stocks. \n ", "3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The identification and preparation of bankable investment proposals, some of which may \nbe financed by ADB, will provide THPPC and THCPC with the necessary competitive advantage \nfor regional economic development. The PPTA will be implemented in three phases: \n(i)  Investment  planning\u2014(a)  evaluating  ongoing  and  completed  official \ndevelopment assistance projects to draw lessons and highlight the potential of \nvarious development sectors; (b) reviewing the municipal and provincial budget \nand evaluating the fiscal and borrowing capacity of the local governments within \nthe framework of the SEDP; (c) assessing the key cultural and tourism assets in \nThanh Hoa City and Thanh Hoa Province; (d) defining the scope of the proposed \ninvestment needs in the prioritized development sectors including tourism, SMEs, \nindustry  and  manufacturing,  and  trade,  and  drawing  up  a  list  of  strategic \ninvestments  in  infrastructure,  taking  into  account  the  human  resource \ndevelopment requirements; and (e) reviewing the relevance of and prioritizing the \nproposed investment proposals according to project selection criteria defined by \nthe project team and the counterpart. \n(ii)  Cultural heritage and tourism planning. A separate business plan based on \nthe preliminary identification of needs in the cultural heritage and tourism sector \nwill identify infrastructure gaps, potential demand, and opportunities, and propose \npossible  enhancements  and  a  financing  plan  that  maximizes  private  sector \nparticipation and public-private partnerships. \n(iii)  Preparation  of  project  investment  proposals  up  to  the  feasibility  stage, \nincluding environmental and social safeguards and technical, financial, economic, \nand  institutional  analyses  to  meet  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  loan  appraisal, \nsupplemented by a socioeconomic survey. \n9.  The project team discussed several options for increasing the leverage of the PPTA \nthrough supplementary grants from ADB and from external and bilateral donors. These grants \ncould be implemented in parallel to the PPTA, subject to approval, but are not covered by this \nTA paper: \n(i)  A  possible  grant  from  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)  for \nsmall-scale infrastructure investments and services, to be implemented by ADB. \nThe JFPR grant project will sponsor capacity-building activities and provide a \ncombined grant-and-revolving-fund facility that will improve access to finance for \ncommunity groups and individuals in targeted poor communities in urban and \nperi-urban areas of Thanh Hoa Province. \n(ii)  A possible grant from the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, to create \nand enhance an enabling environment for private sector participation in roads, \nports, airports, railways, electricity, telecommunications, solid waste, water and \nsewerage, and gas transmission and distribution. \n(iii)  A possible e-Asia Program to be implemented by ADB, for the development of a \nmunicipal  and  provincial  e-government  model  and  an  information  and \ncommunication technology master plan, according to the objectives set in the \n2020 master plan that is now being drafted. The e-government model will then be \nreplicated and expanded. \n ", "4   \n(iv)  A possible grant from the Cities Alliance, to be implemented by UN-HABITAT \nand supported by ADB, for the development of a city development strategy (CDS) \nfor Thanh Hoa City in the context of regional development. The CDS will include: \n(a) a profile of Thanh Hoa City, giving details about its socioeconomic status in \nthe context of provincial and regional development; (b) a development vision for \nthe  city;  (c) strengths-weaknesses-opportunities-threats  (SWOT)  analysis; \n(d)  strategic thrusts for the development of the city in the regional context; and \n(e) action plans, including capacity building, for key sectors of the economy of \nThanh Hoa City and Thanh Hoa Province for stakeholders from the public and \nprivate sectors and civil society. The various outputs of the CDS could then be \nlinked to a future Sustainable Cities Program of UN-HABITAT. \n(v)  Possible financing by the US Trade Development Agency of a study leading to \nthe implementation of a local government investment fund for infrastructure in the \nprovince and the city. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1.25 million equivalent. ADB will provide \n$800,000 out of the total cost, financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The \nGovernment of Spain will provide $200,000 equivalent on a grant basis to be administered by \nADB.  The  Government  of  Viet  Nam  will  contribute  $250,000  in  kind  to  cover  office \naccommodation, transport, remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, and topographical \nand  hydrogeological  surveys.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  the  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n11.  The Government of Viet Nam\u2019s contribution, to be provided through THPPC and THCPC, \nwill finance office space for up to 20 consultants at one time and access to international phone \nand Internet facilities (the PPTA consultant will pay the communications costs); counterpart staff \nof about 60 person-months to support the PPTA consultant, in the process benefiting from \npractical experience and knowledge transfer; vehicles for site visits; topographic survey data to \nconfirm resettlement data; and other essential information that may be identified during the \nPPTA. The consultants will sign an agreement to preserve the confidentiality of data provided \nduring the study. The Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  THPPC will be the Executing Agency and will establish a project preparation unit (PPU) \nunder THCPC for the PPTA. The PPU will have suitable permanent staff for the duration of the \ntechnical  assistance  and  the  ensuing  project  implementation\u2014a  project  director,  an \nEnglish-speaking  coordinator,  and  counterpart  personnel  (two  to  five)  for  day-to-day \ncoordination with the PPTA consultants and with government agencies and other stakeholders. \nA steering committee chaired by the THPPC and composed of representatives from THCPC, \nTHPPC, and other stakeholders will meet at least once a month to provide strategic direction in \nthe preparation of investment proposals and the financing plan. \n13.  The PPTA will be implemented over 9 months, from November 2007 to July 2008, by a \nfirm8 (international consultants, 26 person-months; national consultants, 40 person-months). \n                                                 \n8  The international firm may collaborate with partner national firm. \n ", "  5\nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The firm will be hired on the basis of fixed-\nbudget selection; shortlisted firms will be asked to submit a simplified technical proposal. Other \nindividual consultants may be hired as additional needs are identified during project preparation. \nThe terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \n14.  The PPTA will include four workshops under the responsibility of the firm, to increase \nstakeholders\u2019  participation  in  the  selection  of  investment  proposals  and  ensure  proper \ndissemination of the results of the project components. The consultants are expected to submit \na feasibility study at the end of the project investment component, as well as a business plan for \nthe cultural heritage and tourism phase of that component. All these documents will be in \nEnglish but with an executive summary both in English and in Vietnamese. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Spain, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the Socialist \nRepublic  of  Viet  Nam  for  preparing  the  Thanh  Hoa  City  Comprehensive  Socioeconomic \nDevelopment Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact (Project)      Assumption \n       \n\u2022 Thanh Hoa City as a  \u2022 Increase in annual GDP  \u2022 Government decrees,  \u2022 Full commitment of and \ncompetitive, bankable,  per capita from $1,000  reports, statistics  support from the \nlivable, and sustainable  (2005) to $1,800    Government people\u2019s \ncity, which promotes the      committees, service \nsocioeconomic  \u2022 Thanh Hoa: upgrade in  \u2022 External reports and  providers, and \ndevelopment of Thanh  city status  from class II  poverty impact  beneficiaries \nHoa Province  (2007) to class I (2015)  assessments \n   \nOutcome (Project)      Assumptions \n       \n\u2022 Accelerated economic  \u2022 Increased per capita  \u2022 Government reports,  \u2022 Adequate and timely \ngrowth of Thanh Hoa  GDP/GRP and growth,  socioeconomic statistics  provision of resources \nProvince, with Thanh Hoa  income levels, and    from key stakeholders for \nCity as the regional hub  investments;

It is the northernmost province of Viet Nam\u2019s central coastal provinces, \nwhich are characterized by high poverty (affecting about 45% of the population) and a pronounced geographic \ncontrast between mountainous areas, where close to 1 million ethnic minority people live, and coastal areas, with key \neconomic focal points\u2014the provincial capital, a deep-sea port, several economic zones including Nghi Son, the \ncoastal resort town of Sam Son, and various other historical and tourism attractions. The province has strong potential \nfor regional socioeconomic development, and the capital city, with a population of 300,000, is strategically positioned \nas the regional hub. Thanh Hoa City is 200 km south of Hanoi along the North\u2013South National Highway 1, and \nconnected on the west to Lao People Democratic Republic via National Road 217. However, various constraints stand \nin the way of the full local and regional economic development of the province, among them, aging environmental and \neconomic infrastructure, and aging or nonexistent roads within and between cities. Additionally, inadequate public \ninformation and weak management of key assets are keeping out private investments. \nThe Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) see the proposed project as a \nmeans of turning the province and the city into an important regional economic center and reducing poverty through \nbetter socioeconomic planning, economic growth, and improved infrastructure. It will also help defuse population \npressures on larger urban centers like Hanoi. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will integrate the \nimportant pillars of development identified in the SEDP with a view to reducing poverty and promoting sustainable \neconomic development. It will identify key strategic areas for the economic development of the province and the city, \ngiven Thanh Hoa\u2019s natural resources and comparative advantages; promote private sector participation and regional \nintegration (both domestically and internationally); and invest in the social and economic infrastructure that the \nprovince needs to attract investment and realize its full economic potential. The new investments by both the public \nand the private sector will provide more employment opportunities, generate income, and narrow the gaps in basic \ninfrastructure\u2014all necessary in reducing poverty. For instance, investments in water and sanitation will provide \nsustainable  solutions  to  some  of  the  province\u2019s  health  and  environmental  challenges.  Roads  and  transport \ninfrastructure will generate significant overall time savings: they will improve access to health, education, and other \nsocial services, and shorten the distance between suppliers and markets, bringing labor and raw materials to \ninvestment centers and consumers (tourists) to sites of interest in rural and peri-urban areas. Investments in \ninformation and communication technology will promote overall business competitiveness and efficiency and make \neducation more accessible. \nFinally, in addition to the ensuing investment loan, a proposed Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant project \nwill facilitate investments in smaller-scale, \u201clast mile\u201d community or privately owned infrastructure assets and services \nin poor urban and peri-urban areas (including slums). By providing access to (i) assets and a source of income for \nindividuals or community groups operating small-scale investments, and (ii) affordable infrastructure services for \nindividuals/clients who otherwise would not have access to such services, this grant will help maximize the overall \npoverty and socioeconomic impact of the larger investment project. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nAccording to ADB\u2019s Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004), general intervention projects no longer \nrequire project-level poverty assessments. The contribution of the sector to poverty reduction will be examined through \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Viet Nam Country Strategy and Program 2007\u20132010.

However, the social assessment will include an analysis of the social dimension of poverty to \nidentify opportunities for pro-poor design of the project components. Social assessments will be prepared for the \nproject province and city, and the areas affected by resettlement.  \n \nThe social assessment will include: (i) a demographic, social (education, occupation, etc.), and economic profile of the \npopulation of the project province and city (disaggregated by ethnicity and gender); (ii) available social services and \naccess to other services (formal and informal sectors); (iii) the urban labor market (formal and informal) and its \npotential growth due to increased investment in small and medium-sized enterprises, industry, manufacturing, trade, \netc.; (iv) the potential growth of tourism and its impact on the local labor market and the social life of city dwellers; (v) \nthe potential change in land and property value, and commercial development in the province, and the impact on local \nresidents especially middle-income, low-income, and poor people; (vi) social groups and the poor, who may be \nexcluded or otherwise disadvantaged by the Project; (vii) a profile of these social groups and recommended options \nwhereby the excluded groups and the poor may benefit and negative impact may be avoided; and (viii) needs of client \ngroups, as well as the human development and capacity-building needs of the local governments and the proposed \nsectors.  \n \nHuman  immunodeficiency  virus/acquired  immunodeficiency  syndrome  (HIV/AIDS)  and  human  trafficking,  which \nrepresent significant risks, will be assessed and preventive measures under the Project will be drawn up. The \nassessment of HIV/AIDS will include: (i) the present situation of HIV/AIDS in the project areas; (ii) the type and level of \nvulnerability of the population due to increased tourism in the project areas (disaggregated by gender, ethnicity, age, \ntype of occupation, mobility, etc.); (iii) the provincial plan and activities related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; (iv) \nprograms of donors and nongovernment organizations; (v) recommended activities related to the provincial plan and \nits links with other donors\u2019 programs; (vi) community mobilization and awareness-raising activities to prevent or at \nleast mitigate the impact of the disease; and (vii) capacity building needs of relevant agencies for the fight against \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. The social analysis will use both primary and secondary data. Primary data will be \ncollected from selected project areas through sample survey and focus group discussions. Secondary data will include \ncensus, national socioeconomic survey, and HIV/AIDS and human trafficking data.  \n \nOutline terms of reference for the social development and gender, public health, and resettlement specialists are in \nAppendix 3 of this paper. \n \nC.

Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize positive impact on women: \nThe gender analysis will include an analysis of the situation of women in the project area, their participation in the \nlabor market (formal or informal), their access to basic social services, the constraints on women\u2019s access to the urban \nlabor market, and the potential for increased participation by women in the labor market with the potential increase in \ntourism, small and medium-sized enterprises development, and investment in industry and trade. Gender assessment \nwill also include information on: (i) the extent to which urban development can have both positive and adverse impact \non women\u2019s work in the formal or informal sector, and on access to goods and services among poor women; (ii) the \nextent to which land acquisition or relocation will affect women\u2019s social condition, economic activities, access to \nservices, etc; and (iii) the potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and existing programs for women. The \nsocioeconomic data, and HIV/AIDS and human trafficking data, will be disaggregated by gender and ethnic group (as \nrelevant). A gender strategy will be prepared specifically for the Project, and gender-related strategies will be \nincorporated in the project activities including the resettlement plan. A social development and gender specialist will \nconduct a gender analysis of the Project and prepare a gender strategy and a gender plan for addressing gender \nconcerns in the Project related to resettlement, HIV/AIDS, and capacity building of the executing agency and relevant \nstakeholders. The Women\u2019s Union will be a major stakeholder in the JFPR grant project that is proposed for \nimplementation at around the same time as the Project. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Objective \n1.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will allow the Thanh Hoa City People\u2019s \nCommittee (THCPC) and the Thanh Hoa Provincial People\u2019s Committee (THPPC) to identify and \nhighlight the potential of various development sectors, develop investment proposals, ensure due \ndiligence  and  compliance  with  safeguards,  finance  urban  and  peri-urban  infrastructure,  and \nmaximize private sector participation and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises \n(SMEs), to meet the objectives of the Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDP) 2006\u20132010 and \nimprove infrastructure provision and service delivery. \nB.  Detailed Tasks \n2.  The PPTA will be carried out over a period of about 9 months, starting in November 2007, \nand will require about 24 person-months of international consultancy supported by 40 person-\nmonths of national consultancy. The consultants will be hired by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).  \n3.  The international consultants must have expertise in their respective fields and experience \nin the region, preferably in the Viet Nam central region and Thanh Hoa. The national consultants \nmust  have  worked  previously  with  international  firms  or  on  internationally  funded  projects; \nexperience in urban development and infrastructure and particularly in Thanh Hoa Province would \nbe an advantage. An objective of the PPTA is to build capacity to prepare bankable investment \nproposals. The Fact-Finding Mission identified the industrial sector and the cultural heritage and \ntourism sector as having strong potential for growth and local economic development in a regional \ncontext. The PPTA will have two parts: (i) project investment planning, and (ii) the preparation of a \ncultural heritage and tourism business plan. \n1.  Project Investment \n4.  The  project  investment  component  will  be  implemented  by  a  consulting  firm  with  10 \ninternational consultants (26 person-months) and nine national consultants (40 person-months). \nThe international consultants will consist of the following: an urban development and planning \nspecialist/team  leader  (9  person-months),  an  infrastructure  specialist  (4  person-months),  an \ninstitutional development specialist (1 person-month), a finance and economic specialist (2 person-\nmonths),  an  environment  specialist  (2  person-months),  a  resettlement  specialist  (2 person-\nmonths), an industrial estate development and management specialist (1 person-month), and an \neducation specialist (1 person-month). The national consultants will comprise a co\u2013team leader (9 \nperson-months),  two  infrastructure  specialists  (totaling  6  person-months)  two  finance  and \neconomic specialists (totaling 7 person-months), two environment specialists (totaling 6 person-\nmonths),  a  social  development  and  gender  specialist  (2  person-months),  two  resettlement \nspecialists (totaling 7 person-months), and a public health specialist (1 person-month). \n5.  In the planning phase, the consultant will review the investment proposals included in the \nSEDP  and  put  forward  new  investment  proposals.  All  the  proposals  will  be  evaluated  and \nprioritized on the basis of project selection and assessment criteria in an investment matrix. The \ncriteria, together with their rationale, will be discussed at the kickoff meeting between the team \nleader, the project preparation unit (PPU), the steering committee, and ADB, and finalized by the \nend of the first month. The investment matrix will then be used to prioritize and distribute project \ncomponents between the donors and the private sector and to evaluate the different sources of \npossible funding by the end of the second month. The consultant will assess the competitive \nadvantage of Thanh Hoa Province and Thanh Hoa City in a regional development context. From \nthis analysis, the consultant will recommend the development of specific project components, \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nsubsectors, and industrial clusters high growth potential for the benefit of Thanh Hoa Province and \nThanh Hoa City. The consultant will also identify gaps in institutional arrangements, resources, and \nskills and recommend mitigation measures. In addition, the consultant will review the industrial \nsubsector as follows: (i) The proposed industrial estates in the province (especially the Nghi Son \nSpecial Economic Zone) and their management structure, compared with similar developments in \nthe  region,  particularly  in  Thailand.  The  consultant  will  prepare  a  development  plan  with \nrecommendations for the phasing of infrastructure development on the industrial estates, possible \nproject components, and the management and promotion of the industrial estates, following the \nmodel promoted by the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand or any other suitable model. (ii) The \nvocational training available in the province, to confirm the available skills and the gaps in skills. \nThe consultant will recommend mitigation measures to address the gaps and to increase the \nparticipation of vulnerable groups (women, single parents, and the disabled) in the workforce. \n6.  At the end of the planning phase, the consultant will present project components suitable \nfor  ADB  financing  from  loans  or  guarantee  operations  (on  a  sovereign,  subsovereign,  or \nnonsovereign basis), or from ADB\u2019s private sector operations. The consultant will also examine the \nmunicipal and provincial budget and ensure that there is sufficient counterpart funding. Finally, the \nconsultant  will  review  the  institutional  structure  and  propose  appropriate  changes  and \nrecommendations for further study and consideration. \n7.  In the project investment phase, the consultant will produce a project investment plan and \nconduct feasibility studies on the selected components to provide a basis for the report and \nrecommendation of the President. Therefore, the consultant will: (i) Assess various infrastructure \nsystems and facilities and their appropriateness, provide technical data for the feasibility studies, \nand  manage  the  subsector  review  and  assessment.  (ii)  Review  the  institutional  setup  for \ninfrastructure and recommend international best practices to streamline project management and \nimplementation by Thanh Hoa City and Thanh Hoa Province (to be financed either by ADB or \nothers). (iii) Define an operation and maintenance arrangement that will promote the sustainability \nof the infrastructure projects. The consultant will coordinate with the consultants working on the \nprivate sector initiative plan to maximize private sector participation as well as the role of SMEs in \nproject  implementation  and  operation.  (iv)  Assess  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the \nExecuting Agency, propose a financial management system for ADB financing, and finalize the \nfinancial and economic analysis of the proposed project components and of the Executing Agency \nand implementing agencies according to ADB\u2019s latest Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of \nProjects  (1997),  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of  Projects  (2005), \nOperations  Manual  (particularly  OM  G2,  J7,  and  C4),  Project  Administration  Instructions \n(particularly PAI 5.09), and Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe consultant will prepare project cost estimates, a project financing plan, cash flow projections \nfor  the  project  components  (including  financial  internal  rate  of  return  calculation),  funds  flow \nmechanism,  assessment  of  the  financial  management  capacity  of  the  Executing  Agency  and \nfinancial analysis of the agency and of agencies that will implement the Project, and accounting \nand  auditing  arrangements.  The  consultant\u2019s  report  in  this  regard  will  contain  financial  and \neconomic analyses of the project components and summary financial and economic analyses\u2014\nstandard appendixes to an ADB Board document. (v) Review the initial environmental classification \nof each selected project component and confirm the categorization or recommend a change of \ncategory. The Project has been tentatively classified as category B, since it is expected that most \nof the project components selected will have minimal impact on the environment. Therefore, the \nconsultant  will  prepare  for  category  B  project  components,  and  deliver  as  output  an  initial \nenvironmental  examination  and  a  summary  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002), \nOperations Manual F1/BP and F1/OP (2003), and Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003). \nHowever, if subsequent findings indicate the possibility of major adverse impacts, the project will \nbe reclassified as category A and contingencies will be used to process category A documentation \n ", "  Appendix 4  15 \nfor  the  project.  The  consultant  will  coordinate  with  the  infrastructure  specialist  to  finalize  an \nenvironmental management plan for infrastructure projects. (vi) Review the initial resettlement \nclassification of each selected project component and determine compliance with the safeguards. \nMost of the project components are expected to be in category A; a full resettlement plan will \ntherefore be required. Because the resettlement plans will become the property of THPPC, they \nmust  be  prepared  in  full  consultation  with  THPPC  and  must  be  deemed  by  the  latter  to  be \nimplementable  in  the  Vietnamese  context,  while  still  meeting  ADB  policy  requirements.  The \nresettlement plans must be endorsed by the THPPC and disclosed to project-affected persons \nbefore being submitted to ADB for review and approval. The full resettlement plans must conform \nto ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and be guided by the Operations Manual on \nInvoluntary Resettlement (OM/F2, 2006) and other relevant policies and guidelines of ADB\u2014the \nPolicy on Gender and Development (1998), the Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998), the Policy on \nAccountability (2003), and the Public Communications Policy (2005). \n8.  Under the overall responsibility of the team leader, the consultant will manage field surveys \nof  inventory  losses,  a  census,  and  a  socioeconomic  survey  that  will  serve  as  the  baseline \nassessment and reference for impact surveys done upon completion and after several years of \noperation.  The  consultant  will  draw  up  the  terms  of  reference  for  the  field  surveys  and  the \nnecessary survey instruments, and conduct a sample survey and focus group discussions to \ncollect information on the following: (a) demographic, social (education, occupation, etc.), and \neconomic profile of the population of the Thanh Hoa City and Than Hoa Province (disaggregated \nby ethnicity and gender); (b) available social services and access to other services (formal and \ninformal sectors); (c) urban labor market (formal and informal) and its growth potential due to \nincreased investment in SMEs, industry, manufacturing, trade, etc.; (d) potential growth of tourism \nand its impact on the local labor market and the social life of city dwellers; (e) potential change in \nland and property value, and commercial development in the province, and the impact on local \nresidents  especially  middle-income,  low-income,  and  poor  people;  (f)  social  groups  and  poor \npeople  who may be excluded or otherwise disadvantaged by the Project; (g) profile of these \ngroups with recommended options for sharing project benefits with them and avoiding any negative \nimpact; (h) needs of client groups and the human development and capacity-building needs of the \nlocal government and the proposed sectors; and (i) training needs of local government officials for \npro-poor services. If the social analysis finds that ethnic minority people are present in the project \nareas and are likely to be affected by the Project because of land acquisition or resettlement, or \nthat ethnic minority people are disadvantaged or vulnerable because of their social or cultural \nidentity,  an  ethnic  minority  development  plan  or  actions  specific  to  ethnic  minorities  will  be \nprepared  to  address  their  concerns  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Indigenous  Peoples \n(1998).  \n9.  The consultant will prepare a gender analysis including an assessment of the situation of \nwomen in the project areas, their participation in the labor market (formal or informal), access to \nbasic social services, constraint on access to the urban labor market, and potential for increased \nparticipation in the labor market due to an increase in tourism, SME development, or investment in \nindustry and trade. A gender assessment will be made to gauge: (a) the extent to which urban \ndevelopment can have both a positive and an adverse effect on women\u2019s work in the formal or \ninformal sector, and on access to goods and services especially among poor women; (b) the extent \nto which land acquisition or relocation will have an impact on women\u2019s social condition, economic \nactivities, access to services, etc.; (c) the potential risk of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking, and \nexisting programs for women; (d) programs of donors and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nfor women; and (e) community mobilization and awareness-raising activities for women, to prevent \nor at least mitigate the impacts. A gender strategy will be prepared; it will include activities to \naddress gender concerns in the Project, a gender and resettlement strategy for the resettlement \nplan, and a training program on the prevention of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking to build the \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \ncapacity of women officials of the Executing Agency and relevant stakeholders to implement \ngender-related project activities. The consultant will review ADB\u2019s latest guidelines, such as the \nHandbook on Poverty and Social Analysis (2001) and the Policy on Gender and Development \n(1998), and will follow these as they are relevant to the Project and the terms of reference. The \ntasks specifically related to HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention of human trafficking will comprise \nthe following: (i) collecting information on the incidence of HIV/AIDS and human trafficking in the \nproject areas, and assessing the type and level of vulnerability of the population in Thanh Hoa City \nand Than Hoa Province related to HIV/AIDS and human trafficking (disaggregated by gender, \nethnicity, age, type of occupation, mobility etc.); (ii) assessing the potential risk of HIV/AIDS and \nhuman trafficking; (iii) reviewing the provincial program for the prevention of HIV/AIDS and human \ntrafficking, as well as programs implemented by donors and NGOs; (iv) assessing the capacity-\nbuilding needs of the provincial and district committees responsible for implementing programs to \nraise awareness of HIV/AIDS and prevent human trafficking; (v) in coordination with the provincial \nprogram,  recommending  community  mobilization  programs  for  the  Project  to  build  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and prevent human trafficking; (vi) recommending relevant links with the programs of \nother  donors  and  NGOs;  and  (vii)  preparing  a  budget  to  cover  the  costs  of  the  community \nmobilization and awareness campaign, preventive activities, HIV/AIDS tool kits for health facilities \nin the project areas, capacity building, and implementation of the program.  \n2.  Cultural Heritage and Tourism Business Plan \n10.  The business plan will be implemented in parallel to the planning phase over 3 months by \nthe firm implementing the project investment plan, supported by an international consultant working \nunder the firm for 2 person-months. The consultant will: (i) Coordinate a business plan for the \ncultural heritage and tourism sector in Thanh Hoa Province. The consultant will (a) assess the \ntourism market, both local and international; (b) make an inventory of the cultural heritage and \ntourism sites in Thanh Hoa City and Thanh Hoa Province, including the tourist resort city of Sam \nSon; (c) appraise the potential of these sites for tourism and local economic development on the \nbasis of their historical and economic value and possible inclusion in the World Heritage listing; \nand  (d)  identify  the  requirement  for  associated  urban  and  provincial  service  improvement \nmeasures, including handicraft villages, while maximizing private sector and SME participation. \nThe consultant will develop a project selection matrix based on multi-criteria analysis and finalize a \nlist of potential investment proposals in cultural heritage and tourism as part of the business plan. \n(ii)  Develop  selected  project  investment  proposals  for  urban  conservation  and  heritage \nmanagement, including an assessment of the infrastructure gap, the preservation and restoration \nof cultural heritage assets, and project implementation. (iii) Look at possible enhancements of \nselected  cultural  heritage  and  tourism  sites,  specifically  for  light-and-sound  facilities,  while \nmaximizing energy efficiency. The consultant will also propose delegated management solutions \nfor an urban street furniture and advertising concept. (iv) Prepare cost estimates for the project \ninvestment proposals to be included in the business plan. They will include an assessment of the \ncost-effectiveness of the proposed investment in the sector, the retention of residents and traders \nin their traditional but improved environments, and the required institutional framework, including \nprivate sector participation or public-private partnership and policies for heritage conservation. \nC.  Reporting and Translation \n11.  Reports will be prepared in English, with executive summaries translated into Vietnamese \nto facilitate understanding and decision making. Reports will be submitted in both electronic and \npaper format. All data and analyses will be consolidated and provided to the Government in \nelectronic form. \n12.  There  are  four  workshops  planned  in  addition  to  the  kickoff  meeting:  (i)  a  planning \nworkshop  to  present  and  discuss  investment  proposals,  (ii)  a  cultural  heritage  and  tourism \nworkshop to present and discuss the business plan, (iii) a private investment workshop to present \n ", "  Appendix 4  17 \nand discuss investment proposals and the improved institutional framework for private sector \nparticipation, and (iv) a project investment workshop to present the feasibility studies and ADB \nfinancing.
