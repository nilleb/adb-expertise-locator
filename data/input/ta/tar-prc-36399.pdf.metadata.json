After discussions with the Asian Development Bank (ADB),1 the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  implement  a \nprevention program against HIV/AIDS2 and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Yunnan \nProvince to help mitigate potential social risks associated with the Western Yunnan Roads \nDevelopment  Project  (the  Road  Project)  included  in  the  2003-2005  Country  Strategy  and \nProgram for the PRC. The need for such a Program was identified during a mission that visited \nthe road project area in April 2002. Further discussions on the program objectives, scope, cost, \nterms of reference for service providers, and implementation arrangements were held with the \ncentral and provincial governments in October and November 2002. This report is based on the \nunderstandings reached with the Government and the ADB missions\u2019 observation in the field.3 \nThe logical framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  International Context \n2.  Migration, mobility, and HIV/AIDS are  well documented interlinked phenomena. High \nrates of HIV infection are generally found along transport routes, in border areas, and in regions \nexperiencing  higher  seasonal  and  long-term  population  mobility.  Key studies and efforts \naddressing the link between mobility and HIV/AIDS have identified best practices to prevent \nHIV/AIDS spread among mobile populations. The tool kit for organizing HIV/AIDS prevention \nprograms that was developed under ADB-financed regional TA4 was used in designing this TA \nand will be applied during TA implementation. \n \n3.  In  many  developing  countries,  large  infrastructure  construction  sites  offer  job \nopportunities that attract a large number of young people many of whom migrate from poor rural \nareas of nearby regions. Construction workers comprise one of the key mobile groups together \nwith truckers, seafarers, transport workers, and itinerant traders.  \n \n4.  ADB  and  other  development  agencies  are  now  incorporating  into  the  design  of \ninfrastructure projects HIV/AIDS prevention programs targeting migrant  construction workers \nand the local communities they interact with. ADB has been addressing the need for reducing \nHIV/AIDS  transmission  in  infrastructure  projects  in  various  ways.  Road  projects  generally \ninclude  an  assurance  in  the  loan  agreements  that  the  borrower  will  promote  HIV/AIDS \nawareness and implement prevention programs. In some cases, the need for information, \neducation, and communication on HIV/AIDS and STIs is made a contractual obligation of the \ncontractors. Where the epidemic may be of significant impact, the HIV/AIDS and STI issue is \naddressed under a specific social development plan financed under the loan. The prevention \nprogram associated with the Road Project in Yunnan Province is consistent with this set of \npreventive actions and ADB\u2019s social development policies.  \n \n5.  The Program is in line with the United Nations (UN) resolution to support HIV/AIDS \nresponse for vulnerable people, including mobile populations. In June 2001, the UN adopted, \nand  UN  member  countries  committed  to,  the  resolutions  of  the  United  Nations  General \n                                                 \n1  The Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 21 to 25 October 2002, and further consultations with the ministries of \nHealth and Finance took place in November 2002. \n2  AIDS = acquired immune deficiency syndrome, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. \n3  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 September 2002. \n4  ADB. 1999.  Regional Technical Assistance on Preventing HIV/AIDS Among Mobile Population in the  Greater \nMekong Subregion. Manila. \n ", "2    \nAssembly Special Session on HIV/AIDS (UNGASS).5 The  Government, a signatory of the \nUNGASS resolutions, reaffirmed its commitment to combat AIDS.6 \n \nB.  Local Context   \n1.  Poverty Situation  \n6.  Located in the southwest PRC, Yunnan Province is a poor interior province bordered by \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Viet Nam, the PRC provinces of Sichuan and \nGuizhou, and the PRC autonomous regions of Guangxi and Tibet. Baoshan Prefecture, the \ninfluence area of the Road Project, is located about 100 kilometers from the Myanmar border.  \nIt has a population of about 2.4 million, of whom about 690,000 are poor.7 Thirty-six minority \ngroups totaling about 216,000 people live in Baoshan Prefecture, mainly in mountainous areas.8 \nOf  the  15  official  minority  townships,  11  are  classified  as  the  poorest  townships  in  the \nprefecture. \n \n2.  HIV/AIDS, STIs, Drugs, and Human Trafficking \n7.  Depending on the mode of transmission, the PRC is experiencing three simultaneous \nHIV epidemics. In the west and along the border with the Golden Triangle, intravenous drug use \nis the principal mode of transmission. In the central  provinces,  tainted  blood  and  plasma \npredominate  in  the  transmission  process,  while  in  coastal  areas  commercial  sex  is  the \npredominant mode. The PRC is vulnerable to a substantial increase in the spread of HIV/AIDS \nthroughout large areas of the country and in many different population groups. According to the \nstatistics of the Ministry of Health the HIV caseload was increasing at an annual average rate of \n30% until 2000. The HIV infection rate increased by 58% in 20019 and by 17% over the first half \nof 2002. The HIV positive population is estimated at about one million.10 \n \n8.  The earliest documented case of HIV/AIDS in the PRC was found in 1985, and the first \nHIV/AIDS case in Yunnan Province was found in 1987. By the early 1990s, the HIV epidemic \nwas predominantly found among intravenous drug users along the Myanmar-Yunnan border. \nSince 1995, HIV has spread along truck routes to most parts of Yunnan and in all provinces. \nToday the incidence of HIV/AIDS in Yunnan is reported to be the highest among the PRC\u2019s \nprovinces.  In  2001,  a  total  of  8,317  HIV/AIDS  cases  were  documented  in  Yunnan,  and  \n326 AIDS deaths have been reported. The increase in HIV cases is especially noticeable along \nhighways leading to the Myanmar border.  Also, STIs contribute highly to the spread of HIV \nthrough sexual intercourse. Since 1999, Baoshan City has recorded a significant HIV infection \nincrease among STI patients. \n \n9.  While most of the HIV-affected persons in Yunnan are drug users, recent surveys \n                                                 \n5  The UNGASS commitment covers HIV/AIDS prevention and  includes \u201cResolution 49: by 2005, strengthen the \nresponse to HIV/AIDS in the world of work by establishing and implementing prevention and care programs in \npublic, private, and informal work sectors\u201d, and \u201cResolution 50: by 2005, develop and begin to implement national, \nregional and international strategies that facilitate access to HIV/AIDS prevention programs for migrants and mobile \nworkers, including the provision of information on health and social services\u201d. \n6  At a high-profile conference held in Beijing in November 2002, the Ministry of Health called for immediate HIV/AIDS \naction in the PRC, and welcomed international cooperation in the research and training of health workers. \n7  Living with a per capita annual income below Y1,000. \n8  Among these populations, the Achang ethnic minority, severely affected by HIV/AIDS, is benefiting from an ADB-\nfinanced TA for poverty reduction.  \n9  Part of the sharp increase in 2001 is likely to be attributed to improved efficiency of the surveillance system. \n10  This figure could be underestimated due to sparse surveillance in rural areas, where two-thirds of the epidemic is \nknown to prevail. ", "      3   \nsuggest that this pattern is changing. Drug use might lead to prostitution, and vice versa. \nBecause it was poorly understood in the past, this dynamic led and is still leading to the spread \nof HIV within the community of commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients. The persons \ninfected by or being at high risk of HIV/AIDS are often those who have been trafficked or those \non the demand side of trafficking. The factors that drive people, especially vulnerable young \nwomen and girls, to sexual exploitation and behaviors favorable to HIV/AIDS transmission are \nthe same factors that increase their vulnerability to being trafficked.11 The social stigmatization \ntowards  HIV\u2013infected and  \u2013trafficked  victims,  including  CSWs,  further  marginalizes  these \nalready vulnerable people. \n \n10.  Having less access to information and health care services, while being more likely to be \nforced by hardship and marginalization into making suboptimal choices to earn money, the poor \nare more exposed than wealthy groups to the HIV/AIDS and STI epidemics. Also, the poor are \nmore affected by the additional burden that caring for HIV/AIDS patient places on households. \nAnother  area  of  concern  is  the  possibility  that  the  beneficiaries  of  improved  transport \ninfrastructure  may  be  more  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  as  a  result  of  improved \naccessibility to poor and remote areas, and increased population mobility. \n \nC.  Potential Impacts of the Road Project on HIV/AIDS and STIs \n11.  The Road Project will significantly improve access to and from Ruili. Improving the road \nlinking Kunming and Ruili will facilitate the migration of poor and seasonal workers to other \nprovinces. This migration may aggravate the epidemic\u2019s spread. Subsequently, this may also \nresult in discrimination against Yunnan people living with HIV/AIDS. As traffic increases along \nthe Ruili-Kunming corridor and beyond on the national trunk highway system, truck drivers might \nalso contribute to accelerating the spread of HIV and STIs. \n \n12.  Construction activities associated with the Road Project may also affect the spread of \nHIV/AIDS and STIs. A large number of workers will be stationed at 14 work sites along the  \n80\u2013km expressway. Mostly poor and seasonal, coming from the large pool of floating population \nincluding minority people, the workers will be predominantly young, sexually active people. \nShantytowns of restaurants and bars will develop in the work site vicinities. The service provider \ncommunities and the resident communities bordering the construction sites, mainly minority \ngroups  vulnerable  to  HIV/AIDS,  STIs,  and  trafficking  for  prostitution,  will  interact  with  the \nconstruction workers. The interaction might lead to the introduction of HIV and STIs from the \nnewcomers to the community members and vice versa. After completion of the works, workers \nwith HIV/AIDS and STIs will take them back to their communities of origin. \n \n13.  An HIV/AIDS and STI prevention program targeting construction workers and resident \npopulation needs to be implemented to mitigate these potential adverse social impacts. The TA \nsupports  ADB\u2019s  strategic  poverty  reduction  focus  in  the  PRC.  It  will  (i)  supplement  the \nGovernment\u2019s program for poverty reduction and health development; (ii) complement other \ndonor initiatives, in particular the epidemic prevention program financed by the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom; and (iii) supplement other ADB HIV/AIDS-\nrelated initiatives in the Greater Mekong Subregion.12 \n \n                                                 \n11 Of special relevance is the International Labour Organization Mekong subregional project to prevent trafficking in \nchildren and women for labor and sexual exploitation. The project area includes Yunnan Province. \n12 ADB. 2001. Grant Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet Nam for Community Action for \nPreventing HIV/AIDS. Manila. The objective of the project is to reduce HIV transmission among mobile population, \nmigrants, and source and host communities. \n ", "4    \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n14.  The overall objective of the TA is to prevent an increase in poverty incidence by reducing \nthe  risk  of  transmission  of  HIV/AIDS  and  STIs  that  may  result  from  the  Road  Project.  \nThe  specific  objectives  are  to  reduce  the  risk  of  transmission  of  HIV  and  STIs  among \nconstruction workers,  CSWs, truck drivers, and local resident communities, particularly the \nvulnerable poor and minority people.  Key outputs will include (i) increased awareness about \nHIV/AIDS and STIs among local communities, road contractors, and the road transport business \ncommunities; (ii) behavior change among construction workers, CSWs, and local communities; \n(iii) increased knowledge of safe sex practices and use of condoms; (iv) provision of HIV/AIDS \nand STI prevention services at the contractors\u2019 worksites and within the resident communities; \nand  (v)  an  improved  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  monitoring  system  including  epidemiological \nsurveillance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will consist of four components: (i) advocacy actions on HIV/AIDS and STIs to be \norganized  through  workshops  targeting  local  resident  communities  in  the  project  area, \ncontractors  involved  in  the  expressway  construction,  transportation  companies,  and \nexpressway-operating corporations; and design of an HIV/AIDS information campaign to be \nimplemented along the expressway once it is opened to traffic; (ii) information and education \ncampaigns (IECs) on HIV/AIDS  and STI  prevention through (a) posters, pamphlets, launch \nevents, and focus group discussions at the construction worksites and resident community level \nin the project area; (b) training of peer educators to be selected from construction workers, \nCSWs,  and  local  communities;13  and  (c)  distribution  of  condoms;14  (iii)  provision  of \ncomprehensive  HIV/AIDS  and  STI  medical  packages  to  construction  workers  and  local \ncommunities  including  STI  case  management  and  counseling,  and  voluntary  testing  and \ncounseling (VTC);15 training of health workers in STI management and VTC to ensure efficient, \nquality,  and  client-friendly  services;  and  introduction  of  improved  STI  treatment  and  VTC \nprotocols at least-cost methodologies; and (iv) a project performance and management system \n(PPMS) through monitoring indicators, mainly sexual behavior and treatment-seeking behavior. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $527,500 and a local currency cost of $472,500 equivalent. The Government \nhas requested ADB to provide $800,000 equivalent to finance the entire foreign exchange cost \nand a portion of the local currency cost amounting to $272,500 equivalent. The TA will be the \nfirst activity in the PRC financed on a grant basis from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. \nThe Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $200,000, \nthrough  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  administrative  support  services,  and  office \naccommodation. The Government has assured ADB of the availability of counterpart services, \nfacilities, and funds. The detailed cost estimate and proposed financing arrangements are in \nAppendix 2. \n                                                 \n13 Intravenous drug use and human trafficking will be addressed during IECs as contributors to the spread of \nHIV/AIDS. \n14 Condoms will be made available free of charge during the first year of implementation. Thereafter, the TA will \nensure availability of condoms at affordable cost. \n15 STI treatment packages and HIV testing kits will be procured under the TA and made available to the patients \nthrough local clinics and medical centers. ", "      5   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Yunnan Provincial Leading Group for HIV/AIDS Control (LGHC), established under \nthe Provincial Department of Health,16 will be the Executing Agency and will coordinate TA \nactivities with line agencies, the Yunnan Provincial Communications Department (YPCD),17 and \naid agencies involved in HIV/AIDS control and prevention. The TA will be implemented over 3.5 \nyears starting 3 months prior to the commencement of the Road Project. A steering committee \nwill be set up to follow-up, coordinate, and monitor TA activities. The steering committee will be \nheaded by LGHC\u2019s director and will comprise representatives from YPCD, local government, TA \nservice providers, and target groups. \n \n18.  A  qualified  international  organization/institution  in  association  with  a  domestic \norganization/institute will be recruited as service providers to assist with the implementation of \nthe first three components of the TA (para. 15). These service providers should be highly \nexperienced in HIV/AIDS advocacy with a wide range of stakeholders in the transport sector, \npreferably in Yunnan Province, and should demonstrate competence in HIV/AIDS program \nmanagement  and  training  and  in  capacity  building.  The  international  organization  will  be \nrecruited through competitive bidding following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nquality-based  selection  procedures;  the  domestic  organization/institute  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with similar arrangements. The services are expected to commence in the first \nquarter of 2004 and to be completed in the second quarter of 2007. The medical items required \nunder the third TA component, i.e., condoms, VTC kits, and STI treatment packages, as well as \nthe TA office equipment will be procured by the international service provider in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. An individual international consultant (5 person-months) and \ntwo individual domestic consultants (20 person-months total) will be required to develop and \nimplement the PPMS (fourth TA component). The individual consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Outline terms of reference for \nservice providers and PPMS consultants are in appendixes 3 and 4. \n \n19.  The Government will provide office accommodation for the core team in Baoshan City. \nWhile the service providers will arrange the workshops and conduct the advocacy campaigns, \nLGHC will assist in inviting the business partners. LGHC will also facilitate access and provision \nof STI treatment and VTC in local clinics and medical centers. YPCD and local authorities will \nfacilitate implementation of the TA activities, including cooperating with the service provider\u2019s \nstaff conducting the IECs and ensuring provision of health services to construction workers and \nresident communities.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for Preventing HIV/AIDS on Road Projects in Yunnan Province, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n16 Consisting of 24 governmental agencies, including the Yunnan Provincial Communications Department, LGHC has \nbeen established under the Provincial Bureau of Health to coordinate the HIV/AIDS prevention and control \nprograms implemented in Yunnan Province, in particular those supported by the aid community. \n17 YPCD is the executing agency for the Road Project. \n ", "6   Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal        \nTo prevent an increase in  1.1  HIV and sexually  \u2022 Project performance   \npoverty by reducing potential  transmitted infection (STI)  and management \nnegative social impacts  prevalence rate among target  system (PPMS) \nassociated with the  groups not higher than 2003  \u2022 Provincial and \nimplementation and operation  rates  county HIV/AIDS \nof the Western Yunnan  and STI surveillance \nRoads Development Project  network \n(the Road Project) in an  \u2022 Social indicators, in \nHIV/AIDS prevalent area  particular the \n  incidence of of \nHIV/AIDS and STIs \nand poverty rates, to \nbe monitored under \nthe Road Project \n\u2022 Provincial and \ncounty statistics \n \nPurposes       \n1.
