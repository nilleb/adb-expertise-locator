Since  1992,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  supporting  the  Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program among the six GMS countries.1 The \nThird Ministerial Conference of the GMS Initiative, held in Hanoi in April 1994, identified malaria \ncontrol as one of the regional priorities. In 1999, the Mekong Roll Back Malaria partnership2 was \ninitiated to (i) reduce malaria mortality in the GMS by 50% by 2010 relative to 1998, and (ii) halt \nthe progression of multidrug resistance. The program targets isolated ethnic minority groups \n(EMGs) and migrants with a high malaria burden, who often lack basic information, preventive \nmeasures, and appropriate treatment. ADB has been supporting the Roll Back Malaria Initiative \nthrough a regional technical assistance (RETA) from December 2000 to December 2004.3 In the \nGMS, ADB has developed strong partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO) for the \ncontrol of communicable diseases.4 \n \n2.  A  joint  mission  of  ADB  and  the  WHO  Western  Pacific  Regional  Office  (WPRO)  in \nDecember 2004 reviewed the achievements and lessons learned of the Initiative, which focused \non behavioral change communication for promoting treated bednets. Representatives of the six \nGMS  countries  proposed  capacity  building  of  national  malaria  institutions  (NMIs)  to  adjust \nmalaria control strategies to the needs of EMGs, and mainstream malaria control for ethnic \nminorities in the national malaria control programs (NMCPs). ADB\u2019s GMS Regional Cooperation \nStrategy and Program includes a RETA for strengthening malaria control for ethnic minorities, \nfor $750,0005 in 2005.6 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.    \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Regional Challenges and Opportunities \n \n3.  The GMS countries are committed to achieving the Millennium Development Goals by \n2015, including the reduction of child malnutrition and mortality, maternal mortality, and halting \nor beginning to reverse the trend of HIV/AIDS,7 malaria, and other communicable diseases. \nSubstantial progress has been made in malaria control in the region. The annual malaria \nincidence in the Mekong locations ranges from zero to 200 cases per 1,000 people per year, \nwith an average of 15\u201330 cases per 1,000 people per year. About 2 million people suffer from \nmalaria each year, and about 100,000 of them require hospital treatment. The health and \neconomic impact of malaria remains considerable. Malaria remains a major cause of mortality in \nthe region, with an estimated 20,000 deaths in the region each year, despite the availability of \nsimple and cost-effective interventions to control it. It also causes anemia, low birth weight, \nsubstantially reduced productivity and learning, and income erosion for medical care.  \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, \nand  Viet Nam. \n2  The partnership includes the GMS countries and four aid agencies: ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency, \nUnited Nations Children\u2019s Fund, and WHO. \n3  ADB. 2000.

Malaria has been brought under control in most of the cultivated lowlands of the GMS \nwhere the majority of people reside, with the exception of Myanmar. The malaria prevalence is \nmuch higher in the hills and forests of the region. It is estimated that about 36% of the GMS \npopulation live in malaria-endemic areas with inadequate vector control. Those living there \ninclude ethnic minorities, settled migrants, and forest workers. The most vulnerable among them \nare pregnant women, young children, and very poor and malnourished people.8  \n \n5.  Ethnic minorities are not only more vulnerable due to their environment, but also due to \nlack of education, poor health and nutrition status, lack of assets, lack of recognition of being \npoor, and in general not being familiar with the ways of the modern world. Ethnic minorities \noften spread out in two or more countries and have their own language, customs, and practices. \nThey  often  lack  physical,  social,  and  financial  access  to  public  health  programs.  In  some \ncommunities, opium poppy eradication programs may have required them to grow alternative \ncrops at lower altitude, thereby increasing their exposure to malaria.  \n \n6.  Migrants are more susceptible to malaria than indigenous people as they lack immunity, \nusually coming from lowlands where malaria has been brought under control. Some migrants \nare ethnic minorities migrating from malaria-free higher altitudes. This increases the pool of \ninfected people and also increases the risk of spreading the disease as these people travel \nmore.  Combined  with  inappropriate  use  of  medicines,  this  has  resulted  in  increased \ntransmission of malaria, including of drug-resistant strains. The Mekong region is the global hot-\nspot for malaria drug resistance, which makes it even more important to bring malaria under \ncontrol in the GMS. \n \n7.  People can largely protect themselves by adopting simple, preventive measures against \nmalaria, in particular by using long-lasting impregnated bednets costing $10 per net for two or \nthree people, and lasting for up to 10 years. The use of bednets varies considerably, with the \npoorest using them the least. While government spending on the purchase of drugs has been \nsubstantial, spending on subsidized bednets, at a small cost and with many years of impact, has \nlargely  been  neglected.  Fortunately,  there  is  an  increased  readiness  to  expand  malaria \nprevention.  Malaria  control  also  depends  on  the  particular  customs  of  EMGs.  While  the \ntechnology is available and education materials have been developed, malaria control strategies \nfor EMGs incorporating these various aspects still need to be tested for a variety of conditions.  \n \n8.  The countries have well-established NMIs responsible for implementing NMCPs. More \nrecently, NMCPs have started receiving substantial external funding from the Global Fund to \nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, mainly for basic procurement of equipment and supplies. \nThis follows a large regional malaria control program funded by the European Community, \nwhich ended in 2002. While this assistance has improved the capacity of NMIs for implementing \nthe NMCPS, they lack expertise in addressing the diversity of needs and conditions of ethnic \nminorities living in isolated locations. Provided they can develop the ability to reach these \npeople, funding from the Global Fund can be accessed to scale-up the NMCPs. However, the \nGlobal Fund mechanism is less suitable for capacity building. Therefore, targeted support is \nneeded to help the NMIs strengthen NMCPs to better address the specific needs of ethnic \nminorities.  \n   \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 1998.

The  RETA  for  the  Roll  Back  Malaria  Initiative  (footnote  3),  ADB\u2019s  first  regional \nexperience for communicable diseases control in the GMS, generally did well. For the purpose \nof promoting treated bednets for malaria control in EMGs, it focused on developing user-friendly \neducation materials for malaria control for ethnic minorities, behavioral change communication, \ncapacity building of NMIs in this field, and initiating regional collaboration. A next step will be to \ndevelop comprehensive malaria control strategies for EMGs, so that efforts for EMGs can be \nscaled-up. Rather than doing so through external consultants, it is important to build operations \nresearch capacity of NMIs to develop malaria control strategies for any EMG. Specific efforts \nwill be needed to mainstream these strategies in NMCPs. NMIs also want access to know-how, \nshare information, and learn from experiences, so as to be able to strengthen and expand their \nmalaria control efforts for EMGs. While regional collaboration between NMIs has been initiated, \nthis has not yet been institutionalized as a regular feature of administration and budget.  \n \n10.  ADB is developing substantial regional experience. Following the RETA for the Roll Back \nMalaria Initiative, it provides regional support for HIV/AIDS control, and is planning to continue \ndoing so with funding of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.9 With \nWHO,  it  is  implementing  a  regional  disease  surveillance  and  response  project,10  and  is \npreparing a GMS regional communicable diseases control project for Cambodia, Lao PDR, and \nViet Nam, that would greatly benefit from this RETA. With strong commitment from national \ninstitutions, these regional projects have done well.  \n \n11.  A regional approach is most appropriate for developing strategies for malaria control for \nEMGs. First, malaria, being a vector-borne disease, crosses borders. It spreads more readily as \nconnectivity improves and migrant workers move to new settlements, thereby also increasing \nexposure  of  indigenous  communities.  People  living  in  border  areas,  many  of  them  ethnic \nminorities, share similar problems and customs. Regional coordination will benefit them in terms \nof coordination of programs across borders, learning what works best for them, and preparing \neducation materials. Exchanging experiences can also strengthen commitment and improve \nefforts for malaria control at national level, and can help shape policies and strategies for \nmalaria control. Malaria control would also benefit from standardizing medicines and services \nacross  borders,  so  as  to  create  transparent  quality  standards.  These  activities  require \ninstitutional strengthening and technology development that would benefit from using academic \ninstitutions in the region. Regional collaboration will also help develop the region\u2019s own capacity. \nLastly, recent disease outbreaks of avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome have \ncreated a strong political will for regional coordination to control communicable diseases.    \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The Project\u2019s goal is to reduce the burden of malaria among poor ethnic minorities living \nin malaria-prone locations in the GMS, thereby helping to reduce child and maternal mortality. \nThe objectives are to (i) build capacity of NMIs to develop acceptable, affordable, and effective \nstrategies for malaria control for ethnic minorities; (ii) scale-up malaria control efforts for these \npopulations through NMCPs; and (iii) promote regional collaboration for malaria control.

Manila. \n ", "4   \nproject period is 24 months. The Project will directly benefit ethnic minorities by reducing the \nburden of malaria in selected EMGs; by adapting appropriate models of malaria control; by \nexpanding malaria control efforts for EMGs through NMCPs; and by enhanced regional learning \nand collaboration for malaria control.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The Project will field-test malaria control strategies for EMGs on a pilot basis, including \ntheir costs and effectiveness, and seek to integrate these in NMCPs in the six GMS countries. \nNMIs will be engaged to take the lead in the Project from its onset. NMI staff will work on project \ndocumentation,  design,  fieldwork,  and  evaluation  using  a  participatory  approach.  The \nengagement of NMIs is to ensure long-term sustainability, and also to ensure that the concerns \nof ethnic minorities and regional collaboration are mainstreamed into NMCPs.  \n \n14.  Build Capacity of NMIs to Develop Malaria Control Strategies for EMGs. During the \nfirst half year, NMCP staff will be given training in participatory field-testing of malaria control \nstrategies.  The  malaria  experts  will  make  an  inventory  of  behavioral  change  strategies  in \ncommunities, and their costs. A regional training workshop will be held to discuss lessons \nlearned, teach operations research methodologies and planning, and compare and improve \nstudy designs. Six field sites will be selected representing poor ethnic minorities with high \nmalaria mortality. Behavioral and malaria prevalence baseline information will be collected in the \nselected sites. A comprehensive care package will be provided for 1 year, followed by a second \nround of data collection after 12 months. The findings will be used to strengthen operations \nresearch in the design of strategies for malaria control for EMGs.   \n \n15.  Scale-up Malaria Control Efforts for EMGs through NMCPs. NMCP staff will be \ntrained for scaling-up malaria control for EMGs living in isolated, malaria-prone locations. After \nthe fieldwork, national workshops will be held to review lessons learned and review behavioral \nchange strategies, interventions, and health system requirements for malaria control in these \ntarget groups. Staff and beneficiaries will share the outcome of the field tests with Government \nofficials,  nongovernment  organizations,  research  institutions,  the  private  sector,  and  aid \npartners. NMCPs will establish a process of appraising and improving strategies for scaling-up \nmalaria  control  efforts  for  the  target  groups.  Strategies  will  be  compared,  simplified,  and \nsynthesized to the extent possible, and linked to guidelines and cost estimates for scaling-up. \nNMCPs  will  also  plan and  conduct  advocacy  activities  for  malaria control  for these  target \ngroups, e.g., information of key officials, a public website, and other public activities. \n \n16.  Promote Regional Collaboration for Malaria Control. Stakeholders will evaluate the \nbenefits and constraints of regional collaboration as a model for health sector collaboration in \nthe health sector, and identify priorities and opportunities. NMCPs will also be encouraged to \nlearn from other countries and foster an overall regional strategy, to be improved from time to \ntime. Guidelines encompassing commonalities and differences for malaria control among EMGs \nwill be shared among stakeholders and disseminated through existing websites.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $980,000. The amount of $750,000 equivalent \nwill be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF), and \nadministered by ADB. This will finance consulting services, pilot testing, training, workshops and \nadvocacy,  and  studies.  WHO  will  provide  $130,000  equivalent  for  consulting  services  and \nworkshop support. The six participating countries will contribute the equivalent of $100,000 in \n ", "         5\nkind, including for counterpart staff, office accommodation, and utilities. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n18.  ADB (Mekong Department Social Sectors Division) will be the Executing Agency for the \nTA.  The  regional  steering  committee  for  the  Roll  Back  Malaria  Initiative  will  guide  project \nimplementation. In each country, an existing steering committee of the Ministry of Health will \nreview  progress,  and  guide  project  activities.  The  NMIs  will  be  the  national  implementing \nagencies, and will implement TA activities using existing programs and staff, supplemented with \npart-time malaria expert who will work as research assistants. A small regional technical unit will \nbe set up in Vientiane for the team leader and malaria expert. The regional technical unit will be \nresponsible for coordinating TA implementation and providing technical inputs to NMIs, such as \nfor study design and surveys, training and advocacy activities, and making plans to scale-up. A \nparticipatory process will be followed in project implementation.       \n  \n19.  It is proposed that WPRO of WHO be appointed as the overall implementing agency. \nWPRO has extensive experience in malaria control, follows a bioregional approach with the \nWHO South-East Asia Regional Office (SEARO) for malaria control in the GMS, and has the \ncapacity to provide administrative and technical backstopping. ADB will make a total of 24 \nperson-months of international expert services available including a team leader/social scientist \n(18 person-months), and a malaria expert (6 person-months). These experts will be recruited \nindividually by WHO in consultation with ADB, and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nWPRO will support an epidemiologist (2 person-months), a medical entomologist (2 person-\nmonths), and a medical anthropologist (2 person-months) on a parallel basis. ADB and WHO \nwill jointly supervise all consultants, who will report to both ADB and WHO. The outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. WHO will also provide support for knowledge management and \ndata analysis for field studies. Minor equipment including computers, printers, fax machines, \ntelephone,  and  office  supplies  will  be  procured  under  the  TA  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. On completion of the TA, equipment will be transferred to the \nNMCPs.  \n \n20.  Within 5 days of the end of each month, the team leader will submit to ADB and WHO a \n1\u20132 page TA status report by e-mail, in a format agreed with ADB at the time of contracting. \nWithin 3 months of the onset of the TA, the team leader will submit an inception report including \na review of malaria control in the region, lessons learned, plans for capacity building and field \nstudies, and project implementation schedule and arrangements. Thereafter, the team leader \nwill submit reviews at 6, 12, and 18 months. After 21 months, the team leader will submit the \ndraft  project  completion  report  for  strengthening  malaria  control  for  ethnic  minorities,  and \ninstitutional arrangements for regional coordination. The Project will start in June 2005 and will \nbe completed by June 2007.   \n   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to the Greater \nMekong Subregion to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \nfor the Strengthening Malaria Control for Ethnic Minorities, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n ", "6             Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact       \nReduced malaria  Malaria prevalence in  Survey  Assumption  \nburden among poor  EMGs in pilot areas  \u2022 Similar environmental \nEMGs living in malaria- reduces by half in 1  conditions prevail during \nprone areas in the  year.   before and after survey.  \nGreater Mekong \nSubregion \nOutcome       \n      Assumptions  \n1.
