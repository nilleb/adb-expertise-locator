The Government of the Republic of Maldives in 1997 requested the Bank to\nprovide an advisory technical assistance (TA) for private sector participation in the Maldives'\nports. A TA Fact-finding Mission visited the Maldives in March 1998 and reached an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan,\nimplementation arrangements, and the terms of reference of the consulting services for the TA.1\nThe TA Framework is given in Appendix 1.\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Maldives is an archipelago of about 1,200 small coral islands, of which only\n200 are inhabited, and comprises 24 atolls spread over an area 800 kilometers (km) long and\n130 km wide in the Indian Ocean. lnterisland shipping services are conducted entirely by the\nprivate sector. The Government's role is to provide essential infrastructure such as ports and\ndeepened harbors, and regulatory functions like maritime safety. The Government places high\npriority on the improvement of international and interisland transport services and is expanding\ninfrastructure including the port facilities. Shipping is an important sector and source of foreign\nexchange.\n3. The improvement of facilities under the first Male Port Development Project2 and\nthe relocation of the interisland vessels to the southwest harbor eased the traffic congestion at\nthe commercial harbor, but capacity constraints remained. The main operational constraint was\ninefficient port operations inherent in the lighterage system used for foreign trade.3 With the\nprovision of the wharf within Male Bay,4 the port can now operate without restriction for about\n340 days of the year. Ship turnaround time was consequently reduced from 10 days in 1991 to\n3.8 days in 1997. Male Port is the country's main shipping gateway and the focus of economic\nactivity in the country. It handles virtually all imports, while garments and fish for export are\nloaded at local ports or at sea.\n4. Between 1991 and 1997, external trade grew at very high rates.5 Imports\nincreased mainly because of the growth in per capita income and the high rate of population\nincrease (2.8 percent per annum). The Maldives has been pursuing, with commendable\nsuccess, the development of an open economy linked to international trade and based on the\ncomparative advantage of its small resource endowment. Although the new wharf enables direct\ncargo handling from ship to shore, productivity has not increased significantly. The cargo-\nhandling productivity per vessel has improved by only 75 percent for unloading containers (to 30\nboxes/day) and breakbulk (to 667 tons/day). This weak performance arises mainly from low\nquality in service due to inadequate incentives and inefficient management by the Maldives Port\nAuthority (MPA), which was established on 1 September 1986.\n5. To assist MPA's institutional development and to help draft its charter, a small-\nscale advisory TA was provided.6 MPA's charter was approved by the President on 1 November\n1991, but not all the duties and responsibilities as identified and recommended in the charter\n1\t\nThe TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in April 1998.\n2\t\nLoan No. 911 -MLD: Male Port Development Project, for $6.4 million, approved on 20 October 1998.\nLighterage means the transfer of cargo from ships at anchor to the shore due to nonexistence of a ship\nalongside berthing facility.\nLoan No. 1226-MLD:Second Male Port Project, for $8.8 million, approved on 1 April 1993. The Port\ncommenced operation in June1997.\nThe containerized general cargo traffic grew steadily from 12 percent in 1991 to 27 percent in 1997, with\nactual container traffic in terms of twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) growing from 2,690 TEUs in 1992 to\n10,032 TEUs in 1997. tn 1997, the total exports amounted to 173,000 freight tons.\n6\t\nTA No. 1371-MLD:Maldives Port Authority Project, for $100,000, approved in September 1990.", "2\nare yet entrusted to MPA due mainly to its institutional inadequacies. A second TA followed to\ndraft detailed rules for regulating the safe and efficient movement of shipping and cargo within\nMale Port and for establishing in-house administrative procedures.7 MPA was also required to\nimplement an action plan, with the assistance of consultants provided under an earlier TA. 8 The\naction plan was implemented and led to improvements in MPA's operations adequate to the\nport's initial traffic increases, and in its financial position. However, many of the operations and\nfinance staff trained following the TA sought more attractive employment in the private sector.\nMPA also requires institutional and organizational improvements to manage and operate the\nnew wharf and the port facilities competently and effectively.\n6. With the establishment in 1995 of a Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit (PEMU)\nwithin the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MOFT), the Government started to systematically\nreview its public and parastatal sector with a view to making institutional improvements,\nincluding possible private sector participation. An economic review is currently under way to\nidentify areas in the economy with potential for expanded private sector participation. The\nparastatal sector in the Maldives currently contributes about 15 percent of Government revenue.\nTodate, six of the 19 public enterprises are open to minority private participation, ranging from\n49 percent of equity for Air Maldives down to 25 percent for the Bank of Maldives. The\nGovernment has so far preferred minority privatization, but does not have a policy against\nmajority privatization and is willing to consider it if it proves advantageous. Within PEMU a\nmechanism is needed for systematic setting of objectives and performance indicators for the\nparastatal sector including procedures to monitor the performance and to evaluate the results.\n7. The focus of Bank assistance will be on achieving the Government's objectives\nof private sector participation in Government agencies in general, and in Male Port in particular,\nwith the aim of boosting foreign exchange earnings and improving efficiency and operational\nperformance. The approach would be to maximize private investments through private sector\nparticipation schemes. Private sector participation would not only reduce the burden of financing\nnew investments for rehabilitation, upgrading and development or expansion of facilities, but\nwould also bring the managerial skills and expertise of the private sector into financing,\nconstructing, and operating the facilities.\n8. The Government recognizes that improvements in port productivity and efficiency\ncould be attained through private sector participation in the management and operation of port\nfacilities. The TA will assist the Government in the formulation of policies, criteria, guidelines,\nregulations, and procedures as a framework for opening MPA to private sector participation.\nOne option would be for MPA to perform a pure landlord function, being responsible only for\nproviding the basic infrastructure, while all other operations are carried out independently by\nprivate enterprises on a long-term lease. Another option would be to run the port as a\nGovernment-owned corporation on a commercial basis. Other options to be examined are the\napplication of management consulting contract, concession, joint venture, and public limited\ncompany. Either way, the TA would need to redefine the distribution of regulatory\nresponsibilities, and recommend which of these should be handled by MPA.\nIll.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n9. The overall goal of the TA is to enhance economic development by private sector\nTA No. 1841 -MLD:Second Ma/dives Port Authority Project, for $90,000, approved in January 1993.\nTA No. 1 044-MLD:Institutional Strengthening of Ma/dives Port Authority, for $480,000, approved in October\n1988.", "3\ninvolvement. The TA will identify the options for private sector participation in Government\nagencies. Based on its recommendations and the Government's choice of form, the TA will then\nhelp in the formulation of policies, criteria, guidelines, procedures, and regulatory framework to\nassist the Government in introducing private sector participation in the operation, management,\nand ownership of Male Port. As a result, the cargo handling productivity should at least double\nwithin five years as from participation of the private sector.\nB.\t Scope\n10. The TA will be performed in two phases. In the first phase, the consultants will (i)\nhelp PEMU to develop an overall framework for managing public sector corporations, (ii)\nformulate the broad framework and its program steps for all options of private sector\nparticipation, and (iii) convene a stakeholder seminar on private sector participation to assist\nGovernment's decision making. In the second phase, the consultants will (i) assess possibilities\nof commercializing MPA's activities and the role for private sector participation in the activities\ncurrently undertaken by MPA; (ii) examine the feasibility of MPA functioning as a port regulatory\nauthority; (iii) develop policies, criteria, guidelines, and procedures for selected options, as a\nframework for managing the private sector participation process; and (iv) assess implications of\nprivate sector participation on industrial relations and employment in the Maldives' ports. The\nterms of reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 2.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n11. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $480,000 equivalent, of which $400,000\nis the foreign exchange cost and $80,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government\nrequested that the Bank finance $400,000 equivalent comprising the entire foreign exchange\ncost. The Government will finance the local currency cost of $80,000 equivalent by providing\nsupport facilities and staff on an ad hoc basis. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan\nare shown in Appendix 3. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special\nFund, funded by the Government of Japan.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n12. About 10 person-months of international consultant services will be required to\ncarry out the tasks under the TA.9 The areas of required expertise are institutional restructuring;\nport operation and management; transport economics and finance; and port regulations and\ncorporate governance. The TA consultants will be recruited by the Bank in accordance with its\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Office equipment shall be procured by the consultants in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement. The Executing Agency of the TA will\nbe MOFT. The consultants will work in close coordination with the PEMU. The consultants are\nexpected to commence their services in January 1999.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n13. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of\nMaldives in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 for the purpose of undertaking\nPrivate Sector Participation in the Maldives' Ports, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\nThe engagement of domestic consultants is not anticipated due to their unavailability in the small local\neconomy.", "Appendix 1\nTA FRAMEWORK\nProject Monitoring\nDesign Summary\t Project Targets\t Mechanism\t Risks/Assumptions\nGoal\nEnhance economic development\t Efficiency and perfomance improvements\t Review and assessment of\t Political Instability.\nby private sector involvement,\t in public sector undertakings\t progress at midterm and\t Unsustainable economic\nTechnical Assistance\t development.\nResponse to market and technolocat\t Completion Report.\t Limited availability of land\ndevelopments in port sector\t for expansion.\nPurpose\nProvide Public Enterprise Monitoring\t Strenghen institutions.\t Consultants' interim report\t Nonexistence of legally\nUnit with extensive knowledge for\t attractive commercial\ndecision making on private sector\t Reduce public funding and create an\t Bank review mission during\t conditions for private capital.\nparticipation in public sector\t environment for private investment.\t stakeholder seminar\nundertakings.\t Structural reform (legal, social,\nfinancial, environmental, and\ninstitutional).\nPursue suitable port privatization\t Improve port efficiency and performance.\t Double cargo-handling\t Restricted tariff policy.\noptions such as:\t productwity within five years\nGuarantee of sufficient funds\n1.
