The Government has requested an advisory technical assistance (TA) grant from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  support  the  development  of  its  medium-term  national \nagricultural strategy, as reflected in the Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132006. The \nTA1 proposal is based on a fact-finding mission from 1 to 17 October 2005 which held extensive \nconsultations with representatives of Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock (MINFAL); \nPakistan  Agricultural  Research  Council;  Planning  Commission;  World  Bank;  provincial \ndepartments of Planning and Development, Agriculture, Livestock, and Irrigation; and other \nstakeholders.  \n2.   The Fact-Finding Mission is of the view that the proposed national agricultural strategy \nstudy is worthwhile if it can focus sharply on the issues, constraints, and priorities involved in \nmaking the agriculture sector (i) grow at a sustainable rate to meet future food security and \nexport requirements; (ii) efficient, competitive, and profitable; (iii) diversify from low-value to \nhigh-value products; (iv) generate employment; and (v) help reduce rural poverty. There is \nbroad agreement among stakeholders that the study should use existing data and information \nfrom national and provincial government documents, such as the Medium-Term Development \nFramework, federal and provincial Agriculture and Water Resource Policies and Strategies, and \nother relevant publications from donor agencies. The study should be based on an extensive \nconsultative process involving all stakeholders, including provincial and federal governments, \nfarmers, traders, processors, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), autonomous and private \nacademic and research institutions, and donor agencies. It should take into account regional \ndifferences between and within provinces in terms of resources, constraints, requirements, and \npriorities. Finally, the study should focus more on the \u201chow to do\u201d rather than \u201cwhat to do\u201d \naspects of the prioritized needs of provinces and the federation. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The agriculture sector is a dominant source of growth and development of Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy. It contributes nearly a quarter of the gross domestic product and over half of export \nearnings, employs nearly 45% of the labor force, and provides income to nearly two thirds of the \nrural population. In addition to the main food commodities, agriculture provides raw material to \nagro-based industries and generates foreign exchange through export of raw and finished \ngoods. In the last 20 years, the average annual growth rate of agricultural output is estimated at \nabout 4%, with a lower rate (3%) in the last 5 years. In the last decade, the agriculture sector \nhas experienced a fall in the growth rate and high level of instability due to a number of factors, \nincluding  inclement  weather,  pest  attacks,  water  shortage,  structural  imbalances,  and \ninstitutional constraints. There is also evidence that the growth process in agriculture has had \nlittle  effect  on  rural  poverty  and  may  have  increased  income  inequality  between  rural \nhouseholds and regions. Nonfarm activities have become a substantial source of income for \nagricultural households, especially those with little land of quality or no land. \n4.  Institutional  and  policy  reforms  initiated  under  the  ADB-assisted  Agriculture  Sector \nProgram Loan II (ASPL)2 have facilitated a meaningful engagement by the Government with the \nongoing process, focused on market liberalization and strengthening of support services for the \nagriculture  sector  in  Pakistan.  With  active  support  from  MINFAL,  federal  and  provincial \ngovernments have continued to make gradual progress in pursuing reform measures to (i) \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 1 April 2005. \n2  ADB. 2001.

", " 2   \npromote efficient markets for major commodities, (ii) liberalize markets for fertilizer and seed, \n(iii)  strengthen  agriculture  research  and  extension  services,  (iv)  improve  the  regulatory \nframework for quality control of products and inputs, and (v) assist small farmers. Under ASPL, \nsome policy conditions have been met more quickly and completely than others because of \ndifferences in requirements, administrative capacity of the implementing agencies, and political \nsensitivity to some institutional reforms. The national consensus on a market-friendly regulatory \nenvironment  and  expanded  role  of  the  private  sector  in  wheat  has  been  an  impressive \nachievement. In addition, provincial and federal governments have accepted the idea of making \nagricultural research and extension services more effective through greater administrative and \nfinancial autonomy. Following approval of the Devolution Plan, 2001, district-level governments \nmust  allocate  resources  for  extension  services  in  the  agriculture  sector.  Responsibility  for \nresearch, crop monitoring, regulation, taxation, etc. remains with the provincial government. In \ntheir reorganization plans for agriculture extension services, supported by TA resources under \nASPL, provincial governments are also addressing issues related to divided responsibilities \nbetween provincial and district governments.  \n5.  The overall experience of agricultural growth to date has revealed its accomplishments \nand challenges. The accomplishments are reflected by the diversification and specialization of \nproduction, higher yield levels and farm incomes, and reduced food insecurity in certain regions \nand provinces. However, the agriculture sector faces many serious challenges and constraints \nfor future growth: (i) rising demand for agricultural products with the growth of population and \nincome,  (ii) expanding  role  of  freer  (competitive)  markets  in  agricultural  products,  and  (iii) \nongoing  international  negotiations  under  the  World  Trade  Organization.  Increased  farm \nproductivity (achieved by judicious use of natural resources and other inputs) and diversification \nof production from low-value to high-value products must be the key ingredients of a strategy to \nmake agriculture both productive and profitable. The agriculture sector\u2019s capacity to maintain \nsustainable growth to meet its challenges is constrained by several factors. \n(i)  Factor productivity and farm incomes. Low crop and livestock yields and \ndisparities in farm incomes by farm and region (within and between provinces).  \n(ii)  Land  and  water  rights.  Incomplete  and  defective  land  records,  land \nconcentration, insecure tenancy rights, land fragmentation, and poorly regulated \nwater distribution. \n(iii)  Management  of  natural  resources.  Land  degradation  (waterlogging  and \nsalinity), scarcity and inefficient use of water, and excessive dependence on \nchemicals (pesticides).           \n(iv)  Farm technologies and practices. Inadequate and inefficient use of key inputs \nfor  crop  and  livestock  production,  inefficient  crop  rotations,  lack  of  skills  for \nproductive and economical farm management practices, and low literacy levels.     \n(v)  Agricultural  finance  and  markets.  Inadequate  access  to  farm  capital  and \npoorly regulated and distorted markets.  \n(vi)  Infrastructure  and  support  services.  Low  level  of  public  investment,  poor \nquality, inadequate access, rent seeking, and lack of participation in decision \nmaking. \n(vii)  Research and extension services. Public sector institutions lack coordination, \ncapacity, and incentives to generate, adapt, and disseminate new technologies \nand information to promote competitive and diversified agriculture. \n(viii)  Government  policies  and  role  of  private  sector.  Distortional  policies  that \ninhibit private sector participation and investment, and market concentration. \n \n \n ", "    3\nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare a medium-term national agricultural strategy that the \nGovernment can use to (i) rationalize investments, and (ii) demonstrate how the proposed new \ninitiatives will help achieve sustainable agricultural growth with diversified production and exports, \nexpanded employment, reduced regional and income differences, and decreased rural poverty. The \nstrategy  documents  will  be  prepared\u2014taking  into  account  regional,  provincial,  and  national \nrequirements\u2014through a consultative process led by the provinces and facilitated by the federal \ngovernment. The TA will (i) review in detail recent developments in the agriculture sector at the \nnational and provincial levels; (ii) identify major issues, challenges, and constraints; (iii) indicate \nniche production lines and enterprises in each region and province; (iv) recommend appropriate \nmeasures and policies to benefit, in particular, small farmers (owners and tenants, and migrant \nworkers  as  appropriate),  commercial  farmers,  landless  agricultural  workers,  women,  resource \nconservation, and the environment; and (v) assess the roles of public and private sectors in \nimplementing the proposed strategy.  \n7.  The proposed strategy should help identify triggers to support agricultural growth on a \nsustainable  basis\u2014rising  farm  productivity  and  profitability\u2014for  ensuring  food  security, \nenhancing household  income,  expanding  rural  employment,  decreasing  intra-provincial  and \ninter-provincial disparities, and reducing rural poverty. In sustaining the growth process, special \nattention must be paid to resource management and conservation, and the expanded role of the \nprivate sector. The strategy should aim at promoting science-based, innovative farm practices \nthat enhance the economic efficiency and export competitiveness of the agriculture sector with \nemphasis on food security, value addition, and comparative advantage for resource allocation. \nPublic sector capacity to plan and facilitate agriculture development must be strengthened, with \nparticular emphasis on its regulatory functions, investment in infrastructure, and public-private \npartnerships. At the same time, incentives and support for the private sector must be designed \nand implemented to harness its competitive advantage for sustainable agricultural enterprises. \nFollowing  an  extensive  consultative  process,  the  TA  will  produce  a  medium-term  national \nagricultural  strategy  document  that  includes,  at  the  national  and  provincial  levels,  a  full \ndiscussion  of  proposed  policies,  resource  requirements,  key  milestones,  and  institutional \nprocesses required in the ensuing 10-year time horizon. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA is expected to help build consensus on a national and provincial agricultural strategy \nframework based on analysis of the following issues. \n(i)  Sources of supply and demand for agricultural products and the roles of subsectors \nin agriculture. \n(ii)  Major constraints of institutions, infrastructure, and policies likely to affect the growth \nprocess in the provinces and their diverse regions. \n(iii)  Specific supporting measures, such as laws and regulations, infrastructure, research \nand extension services, investment priorities, and public-private partnerships. \n(iv)  Policy,  institutional,  and  administrative  roles  of  federal,  provincial,  and  local \ngovernments necessary to achieve the objectives. \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n9m. emberTsh, Be omaredt hoof Ddoirleocgtoicrsa,l  Mfraanmaegwemoerkn tf,o orr  astna faf,g arnicdu mltuarya bl es tprraetleimgiyn asrhyo inu lnda ttuarkee.   into account the \ntransitional  state  of  agriculture  in  Pakistan  with  focus  on  two  interrelated  areas.  The  first \ncomprises traditional commodity agriculture (such as grains, cotton, and sugarcane), which \n ", " 4   \nplays a significant role in the household economy of most farmers. The second reflects the \ntransition  from  traditional  commodity  agriculture  to  high-value  enterprises  like  horticulture, \nfloriculture, livestock, and food processing, which require a good understanding of the best way \nto target and manage this process, and integrate small farmers into sustainable value chains \nlinked with viable private sector players. \n10.  The TA team members, in consultation with stakeholders, will be expected to carry out \nin-depth analysis of key areas to guide the formulation of agricultural strategy. An important \nissue is to consider measures to enhance opportunities for diversification on a competitive, \nequitable, and sustainable basis. Landownership (land records and tenurial arrangements) and \ndirect taxation issues have a strong impact on efficiency and equity in agriculture. In addition, it \nmay be necessary to assess the impact of government taxes and subsidies on the performance \nof the agriculture sector and trade, establish growth and region diversified poverty links, and \nanalyze financial allocations of the federal and provincial governments in the agriculture sector, \nespecially  in  relation  to  other  sectors.  This  analysis  should  help  establish  priorities  for \ngovernment policies and institutional reforms at provincial and federal levels. \n11.  The strategy development approach will take into account and build on lessons learned \nfrom investments in Pakistan\u2019s agriculture sector, including programs assisted by ADB and other \ninternational financial institutions, especially the World Bank.3  The analysis will be guided by \nADB\u2019s ongoing initiatives (ASPL and Agribusiness Development Project4). The two-part approach \nsuggested  earlier  would  complement  these  ongoing  projects  and  activities  while  taking  into \naccount the linkages between traditional agriculture, high-value agriculture, and agribusiness.  \n12.  The  approach  for  addressing  key  issues  and  constraints  will  be  identified  through \ncomprehensive  consultations  with  provincial  governments  and  other  key  stakeholders.  The \nconsultative process will be carefully structured as there are marked inter-provincial and intra-\nprovincial  differences  in  resources,  institutions,  and  capacity.  During  consultations  in  the \nprovinces, efforts will be made to associate the local (district) governments because of their new \nadministrative and fiscal responsibilities after devolution. In addition, active collaboration will be \nensured with related government departments (Irrigation, Livestock, Food, Forestry); public \nsector financial and nonfinancial institutions; academic institutions; research organizations; and \nprivate sector organizations of farmers, traders, and processors. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing   \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $350,000 equivalent on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The federal and provincial governments are expected \nto provide in-kind contribution worth $90,000 for office accommodation, counterpart staff, and \nlogistic support. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MINFAL will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Implementation will begin at TA approval \nand following concurrence of the Government, will last 9 months, with expected completion by \n31 December  2006.  MINFAL  will  establish  a  steering  committee  for  policy  guidance  with \nrepresentation  from  the  federal  and  provincial governments  including  the  Ministry  of  Finance, \nPlanning Commission, and Ministry of Water and Power; NGOs; private sector; and farmers.5 The \n                                                 \n3  World Bank is currently undertaking a study on Rural Growth and Poverty Reduction.

Manila. \n5  ADB staff at headquarters and the Pakistan Resident Mission are expected to play a key role in facilitating these \nmeetings and ensuring coordination with other stakeholders and donors in the agriculture sector. ", "    5\nsteering committee will facilitate the establishment of provincial working groups with representation \nfrom relevant provincial and district level institutions, farming community, NGOs, and private sector. \nThe provincial working groups will (i) coordinate the analysis of major issues and constraints on a \nregional and provincial basis, and (ii) consolidate the provincial strategy paper with inputs from the \nTA  consultants.  The  provincial  working  groups  will  meet  at  least  three  times  during  the \nimplementation period. At the provincial level, coordination will be provided by the relevant Planning \nand Development Department as the chair of the existing provincial coordination committee. The \nprovincial Department of Agriculture will act as the secretariat for the provincial working group to \nprovide required counterpart staff and assistance to the TA consultants.   \n15.  The study will be conducted by a team of seven consultants: one international (team leader) \nand six domestic consultants. The team will be led by an agriculture economist with a strong \nbackground in agricultural policies, institutions, and administration; and extensive experience at the \nnational and international level. The other members of the team will prepare thematic papers and \nassist  the  provincial  working  groups  in  consolidating  the  provincial  strategy  document  in  the \nfollowing disciplines: (i) field crops, (ii) horticulture and floriculture, (iii) livestock and poultry, (iv) on-\nfarm  water  management,  (v)  institutions  and  policy,  and  (vi)  devolution  and  information \nmanagement. Outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n16.  ADB will recruit the international consultant on an individual basis in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. The domestic consultants will be selected through a firm in \naccordance with arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic \nconsultants following the quality and cost based selection method. The simplified technical proposal \nprocedure  will  be  used  to  select  the  consulting  firm.  The  TA  requires  4  person-months  of \ninternational and 18 person-months of domestic consulting services.  \n17.  The  consultative  process  will  include  two  to  four  meetings  and  workshops  with \nstakeholders in each province and one or two meetings and workshops at the national level. \nThe inception report to be prepared within 1 month of TA commencement will include a scoping \npaper with an inventory of existing data and information, key knowledge gaps requiring intensive \nanalysis, and a detailed work plan. In order to help integrate the ADB work on agricultural sector \nstrategy with World Bank work on rural growth and poverty reduction, a joint workshop will be \norganized after completion of the first round of provincial consultations under the TA. The draft \nfinal report, to be prepared within 9 months, will consist of one chapter each for the four \nprovinces outlining the strategy for the respective province and its regions, and a final chapter \ncontaining an integrated national report incorporating feedback received during provincial and \nfederal workshops. A suggested outline of the final report to be prepared on completion of the \nTA is in Appendix 4. \n18.  During the implementation period, the team leader will use the 4 person-months in blocks of \napproximately  4  weeks  for  each  input  to  fulfill  the  obligations.  The  team  leader  will  assign \nresponsibilities and provide necessary guidance to sector specialists, coordinate and organize all \nwork, and prepare and submit the required reports in accordance with the agreed work plan to \nbe approved at TA inception.   \n \nIV.

Devolution  Specialist/Workshop  Facilitation  (domestic,  3  person-months).  The \nstarting point in developing a national agriculture sector strategy for Pakistan is to recognize that \nthe key decisions in agriculture-related issues are normally made, or expected to be made, at \nprovincial level. The federal Government plays a supportive role, especially in areas of national \nimportance or that the provinces individually cannot afford, or deal with, or constitutionally fall \noutside their responsibility. The Devolution Plan, 2001, has decentralized the decision-making \npowers of provincial governments in certain areas in which district governments can play a more \neffective role. In the context of agriculture, the district government has been assigned the \nresponsibility of providing financial resources to\u2014and some of the administrative responsibilities \nfor\u2014agriculture extension services. However, overall technical supervision of these services \nand a major part of the administrative responsibility remain with the provincial government. The \nTA resources of ASPL have been used to help the four provincial governments reorganize their \nagriculture research and extension services, including effective coordination between district \nand  provincial  governments  with  respect  to  agriculture  extension  services.  Provincial \ngovernments  are  also  developing  action  plans,  to  be  partly  financed  by  ASPL,  which  are \nexpected to be implemented in the next 2\u20133 years. The study team for the National Agricultural \nStrategy will incorporate these developments and their likely effects on agricultural growth in \nPakistan.  In  addition,  the  specialist,  in  consultation  with  the  team  leader  and  other  team \nmembers, will do the following. \n \n(i)  Review ongoing work carried out by ADB (under the Decentralization Support \nProgram1 and ASPL), analyze the implications of devolution on agriculture in the \nfour provinces, and highlight institutional constraints and opportunities. \n(ii)  Review the reorganization plans prepared under ASPL and analyze how the \nprovincial  governments  are  addressing  issues  involved  in  the  divided \nresponsibilities between the provincial and district governments, in consultation \nwith provincial and district governments. \n(iii)  Facilitate workshops at the regional, provincial, and federal level and consolidate \ndeliberations which could clarify the status and adequacy of delivery of services \nin the agriculture sector, and processes and mechanisms utilized in the planning \nand implementation of medium-term initiatives in the agriculture sector. \n(iv)  Recommend measures to enhance coordination among the district, provincial, \nand  federal  government  levels  in  the  consolidation  of  inputs  required  for \npreparation of the provincial and national agricultural strategies.  \n(v)  Assess information needs and technology requirements at provincial and district \nlevel,  and  recommend  outsourcing  modalities  for  establishing  web-based \ninformation platforms. \n(vi)  Assist provincial and federal governments and the team leader in preparing a \nthematic paper which articulates how the proposed initiatives under the TA would \nhelp  clarify  the  roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  district  and  provincial \ngovernments in the delivery of agriculture support services, and recommend \nsteps required to augment institutional coordination processes for facilitating the \nconsolidation  and  implementation  of  the  provincial  and  national  agricultural \nstrategies.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002.
