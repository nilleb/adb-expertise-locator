INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the official visit of the President of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to Brunei \nDarussalam in September 2009, and during the ADB annual meeting in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, \n1\u20134 May 2010, the Government of Brunei Darussalam requested technical assistance (TA) for \nstrengthening its public financial management (PFM).1 This would complement ADB's earlier \nsupport to help develop the capital market master plan.2 ADB fielded a consultation mission in \nNovember 2009, followed by a scoping mission (converted to a fact-finding mission) in May \n2010 to discuss and reach an understanding with the government on the objectives and scope \nof  the  proposed  TA,  the  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  and  cost  and  implementation \narrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Strengthening fiscal management is a longer-term challenge. The recent economic \ncrisis underlined the vulnerabilities of the country's economy and their impact on long-term \ngrowth  prospects.  Brunei  Darussalam  is  heavily  reliant  on  oil  and  gas  production,  which \naccounts for 70% of gross domestic product, 95% of exports, and 90% of government revenues. \nThe  reliance  on  oil  and  gas  greatly  influences  the  country's  output  growth.  In  2008,  the \neconomy contracted by 1.9% as oil and gas production declined by 6.2%. However, economic \ngrowth is set to resume, forecast at 1.1% in 2010 and 1.5% in 2011, supported by higher global \nenergy demand and prices, and the start of exports from a $450 million methanol plant under \nconstruction.4 Overall, \u201cwhile growth has slowed recently due to a decline in hydrocarbon \nproduction, economic activity is expected to increase gradually as production rebounds and \nsupportive government spending comes on stream\u201d.5 \n \n3.  The government is accelerating efforts to diversify its economy. The significant \ncontraction in hydrocarbon production, for a second year in a row, reflected the maturity of the \ncountry\u2019s oil fields and a government decision to use reserves more sparingly to extend the life \nof energy production. Against this background, the government has engaged in diversifying the \neconomy by promoting the downstream and petrochemical industry, tourism, financial services, \nand, most recently, the development of halal products. However, the extent of the success of \nthe diversification process depends on how fast projects under the national development plan, \nRancangan Kemajuan Negara (RKN) 2007\u20132012, are rolled out. The government needs sound \nfiscal  management  to  ensure  that  the  efforts  to  achieve  the  RKN  2007-2012  goals  are \nsustainable and do not lead to a fiscal crisis that may extend to the rest of the economy if output \ngrowth slows again or even contracts. The main longer-term challenges are to expand oil and \ngas reserves, diversify the production base by boosting private sector activity, and enhance \nfiscal management to improve expenditure efficiency. Experience in other countries confirms \nthat strong budget institutions shape and regulate policy and the process of generating and \nallocating  public  resources  for  carrying  out  government  functions.  The  design  and \nimplementation of a medium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) accompanied by a medium-term \n                                                 \n1  The TA project first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 September 2010. \n2  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to Brunei Darussalam for the Development of the Capital Market and a \nModernized Payment and Settlement System.  Manila (TA 7075-BRU). \n3 Brunei Darussalam joined ADB in 2006. It has been an active participant in and supporter of Brunei, Indonesia, \nMalaysia, Philippines-East Asian Growth Area and its programs since the subregional economic cooperation \ninitiative was finalized in 1992. \n4   ADB. 2010.

Washington D.C. \n ", "2   \nexpenditure framework (MTEF) would assist the government in achieving budget realism and \nrobust fiscal management. \n \n4.  Brunei Darussalam is ready to adopt a modern fiscal framework and a modern \npublic financial management system. Both are needed to ensure sustainable development \nand effective use of public resources. They will also help establish strategic priorities and \nmonitor impact. Sustainability and credibility of a fiscal framework are largely determined by \nimplementation of a budget that is based on realistic economic and fiscal projections; by taking \ninto account the budgetary cost of policy decisions; and by effective oversight and monitoring of \nthe budget process. In the absence of an MTFF and an MTEF, the discrepancy between \nplanned  and  actual  spending  can  be  large,  thereby  undermining  fiscal  prudence  and \ndevelopment effectiveness. It is essential to build within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) the \ninstitutional focus and capacity for macroeconomic policy analysis that enables it to prepare a \nfiscal strategy to underpin the annual budget. A fiscal strategy will support proper planning and \nhelp achieve the government\u2019s overall macroeconomic policy objectives\u2014high private sector-led \nreal gross domestic product growth, low inflation, comfortable levels of international reserves, \nand debt sustainability. Besides, an MTEF links policy, planning, and budgeting. Experience \nsuggests that an MTEF can help improve budget process and outcomes through greater clarity \nof policy objectives, predictability in budget allocations, comprehensiveness of coverage, and \ntransparency in the use of resources. Reporting is particularly important to satisfy the principles \nof transparency and accountability. \n \n5.  A  sound  PFM  system  supports  aggregate  control,  prioritization,  accountability  and \nefficiency in the management of public resources and delivery of services, which are critical to \nthe achievement of public policy objectives. In Brunei Darussalam, the current practice in fiscal \nplanning and budgeting does not provide a sound basis for aligning resources with the policies \nof  the  5-year  RKN.  First,  the  budget  formulation  process  lacks  a  coherent  medium-term \nstrategic framework. Capital and recurrent expenditures are not adequately linked to national \npolicies  and  sector  budgeting.  Second,  budget  allocation  is  essentially  incremental,  and \nbudgetary decisions are not yet policy-driven or program-oriented. Expenditure allocations are \nbroad and concern just three areas \u2013 personal remuneration, operation, and special expenditure \n(for both current and capital expenditures). The budget takes the form of aggregate ministerial \nallocations with exhaustively detailed line item classifications but limited information on the \npurpose of spending. Requests by spending agencies for supplementary budget allocations are \nfrequent. There is no effective forward planning of recurrent spending. Finally, the capacity to \nundertake  effective  independent  economic  and  fiscal  forecasting  is  weak,  and  there  is  a \ntendency toward optimistic macroeconomic and revenue projections.  \n \n6.  Introducing a medium-term perspective into the annual budget process and costing \nsector  strategies  to  determine  whether  multiyear  current  and  new  sector  policies  can  be \nfinanced within annual aggregate fiscal targets is a challenge for the government. In view of this, \nthe government is committed to ensure that (i) the process for translating public policies into \nbudgets is satisfactory; (ii) budget and fiscal risk oversight is comprehensive; (iii) the budget is \nrealistic and implemented as planned, and in an orderly and predictable manner; and (iv) there \nis  a  multiyear  perspective  in  budget  planning,  and  expenditure  policy  and  budgeting.  It  is \nexpected that the MTFF and MTEF will not only take into account the volatile nature of resource \nrevenues, but also align expenditures with the priorities of the RKN. It is important that future \nbudgets are based on both an MTFF and an MTEF.  \n \n7.  The MTEF will be a 3-year framework that details policy priorities and informs decisions \non allocation of resources across the government and within spending agencies. The MTEF \n ", "  3 \nconsists of a top-down resource envelope consistent with macroeconomic stability and resource \navailability. The MTFF is underpinned by a fiscal strategy that helps strengthen the capacity for \neconomic and fiscal forecasting, and includes the assumptions behind macroeconomic and \nrevenue projections. Policymakers can use the MTFF and MTEF to analyze different scenarios \nto match aggregate expenditure with resource availability and assess the costs and benefits of \npolicy options and implementation of national priorities over the medium-term. This will ensure \npredictable and effective budget allocations to the priority sectors as envisaged in the Brunei \nDarussalam Long-Term Development Plan, and RKN 2007\u20132012. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  more  efficient  allocation  and  management  of  public \nresources within MOF, in accordance with international standards and good practice for PFM. \nThe TA outcome will be stronger fiscal planning and capacity for budget formulation. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The key outputs of the TA will be to (i) prepare a strategy for PFM capacity building, \n(ii) develop and institutionalize MTFF within the government, (iii) develop and implement MTEF \nwithin the government, and (iv) strengthen the monitoring and evaluation skills of ministerial \nstaff. \n \n10.  TA approach. Adoption of a gradual approach to reform in budget planning, formulation, \nand coordination through a participatory process will ensure government ownership. The TA will \nstrengthen coordination between MOF, the Department of Economic Planning and Development \n(JPKE), and the line ministries. The TA will identify training needs and recommend capacity-\nbuilding measures, with particular attention to pertinent operational staff. It will bolster the \ncapacity  of  MOF,  the  JPKE,  and  the  line  ministries  to  build  skills  and  adopt  a  change \nmanagement  and  communication  strategy.  There  will  be  greater  use  of  action-learning  or \nlearning-by-doing approaches, so that people experience the new processes as they learn, \nwhich will improve the process of socialization. Guidelines and manuals will be developed and \nstaff  trained.  On-the-job  training  will  be  widely  used.  In  coordination  with  the  Information \nTechnology  (IT)  Department,  the  TA  will  help  formulate  the  MTFF  and  MTEF,  and  the \naccompanying database. In so doing, the TA will make recommendations on the upgrading of \nthe integrated Treasury Accounting and Financial Information System (TAFIS). The TA will \norganize study tours, workshops and seminars, using the training infrastructure and resources \nof academic institutions locally and overseas. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA project is estimated to cost $1.5 million. 6 ADB will finance an estimated amount \nof $800,000 on a reimbursable basis and the Government of Brunei Darussalam will directly \nfinance $700,000 for TA activities. 7 The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e r  e i n    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n6m   Tehmeb meersth, oBdosa orfd p oafy mDeirnetc ftoorr tsh,e M TaAn waiglle bme ebnats,e odr  osnt athffe,  aprnodc emdaurye sb ea dporpetleimd ifnoar rAyD iBn \u2019sn aetaurlrieer.

Direct government financing will include costs incurred in training, overseas training \nand study tours, administrative and logistical support, workshop facilities, training, equipment, and contingency \nexpenditure relating to training and workshops. \n ", "4   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented from November 2010 to December 2012. MOF will be the \nexecuting  agency;  the  Department  of  Economic  Planning  and  Development  (JPKE), \nExpenditure Division, IT Unit, and Treasury Department will be the implementing agencies. A \nsmall, high-level steering committee under the chairmanship of the permanent secretary (fiscal) \nof MOF, and comprising members from JPKE, Expenditure Division, IT Unit, and Treasury \ndepartment  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  TA.  It  will  meet  regularly  to  review \nimplementation progress. \n \n13.  The  TA  will  require  three  international  consultants  for  a  total  of  34  person-months \nworking  intermittently  (a  PFM  and  budget  management  specialist/team  leader,  a \nmacroeconomist (fiscal), and a monitoring and evaluation specialist). The indicative terms of \nreference of the team of consultants is provided in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited \nby ADB as individual consultants according to its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, \nas amended from time to time). All service payments under the project will conform to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  Disbursements under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The consultants may organize study tours and the countries will be \ncarefully selected for their relevance to the economic and financial status of Brunei Darussalam. \nThe consultants will prepare detailed work plans within 2 weeks of mobilization. The work plans \nwill contain timetables for deliverables defined for each component of the TA in consultation with \nMOF and coordinated by the team leader. The consultants shall report monthly on the progress \nof implementation of key activities in their workplans. Draft final reports will be submitted by the \ndeadline  specified  in  the  work  plans  after  incorporating  comments  from  MOF  and  ADB. \nTripartite  meetings  will  be  held  before  the  draft  final  report  is  finalized.  The  final  report, \nincorporating the comments of MOF and ADB during and after the tripartite meeting, will be \nsubmitted at the end of the services. \n \n14.  The government will provide complementary inputs. It will directly finance overseas \ntraining and study tours, procure IT equipment, provide administrative and logistic support, and \norganize workshops (with support from the team of consultants).  \n \n15.  TA implementation will be monitored through continuous communication with MOF, the \nimplementing  agencies,  and  other  stakeholders,  as  well  as  through  regular  missions, \nconsultations and reviews.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a reimbursable \nbasis  to  the  Government  of  Brunei  Darussalam  for  Strengthening  the  Public  Financial \nManagement, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nMore efficient allocation and  Better performance by MOF  Review of successive  MOF commitment and strong \nmanagement of public  against PEFA indicators  annual budgets and  leadership in introducing budget \nresources within MOF, in  relating to multiyear  national development  reforms  \naccordance with  perspective in fiscal planning  plans.

Consultants will formulate a well-sequenced, prioritized action plan for reforms in budget \nmanagement  systems,  including  a  budget  planning  process  that  would  contribute  to  the \npreparation  of  a  medium-term  fiscal  framework  (MTFF)  and  a  medium-term  expenditure \nframework (MTEF), and strengthen the monitoring and evaluation capacity of ministerial staff. \nOverall guidance will be based on technical assistance (TA) methodology and activities as \noutlined  in  the  TA  paper.  The  TA  project  will  build  on  good  international  public  financial \nmanagement  (PFM)  practices,  including  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability \nperformance indicators. Training needs to build PFM skills and competencies will be assessed \nand will form the basis of capacity development, with agreed milestones to be included in the \naction  plan.  The  consultants  will  be  providing  inputs  on  policy  issues  and  must  exercise \nflexibility in the design and implementation of TA activities. They also must ensure participation \nof all stakeholders to build consensus and ownership of the reform process. \n \n2.  The  consultants  will  work  in  coordination  with  the  team  leader  and  report  to  the \nDepartment of Budget within the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and will also coordinate activities \nwith the Asian Development Bank (ADB) project team (through the team leader) to ensure \nquality, integration, and timelines of outputs. The major reports will be inception, midterm, draft \nfinal, and final, containing the required TA outputs in draft or final form. In addition, quarterly \nreports on status of implementation and any other issue will be produced. \n \nB.  International Consultants (34 person-months) \n \n1.
