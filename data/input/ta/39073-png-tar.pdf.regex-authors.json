The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) recognizes that the private sector plays a \ncentral role in contributing to economic growth and acknowledges the need for reform of the \nbusiness environment, as evidenced by public discussions, statements of policy and intent, and \nstrategy documents. The Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Strategy (MTDS)1 includes \npolicies to encourage greater private sector participation in the economy. The Government has \nhighlighted three main elements as critical to achieving a strong economy:2 (i) creating a stable \ninvestment climate; (ii) providing an efficient, effective, and affordable public sector; and (iii) \ncreating a competitive and dynamic private sector. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) completed a private sector assessment (PSA)3 in \n2003 which is currently being updated.4 The PSA analyzes the country\u2019s business environment \nand suggests measures to help the Government identify and remove the obstacles to growth of \nthe  private  sector.  In  PNG,  momentum  has  been  established  to  improve  the  enabling \nenvironment  for  private  sector  development  and  create  opportunities  for  reform.  This  is \nunderscored by on-going government initiatives such as the establishment of the National \nWorking  Group  on  Impediments  to  Business  and  Investment  (NWGIBI),  as  well  as  the \nencouragement of feedback from stakeholders. Private sector representatives have expressed \nsupport for resolving the issues raised in the PSA and provided input to the design of this \ntechnical assistance (TA), which ADB has agreed to support. The Government has asked ADB \nto provide technical TA support for developing and initiating private sector-related economic \nreforms. \n \n3.  The TA design and monitoring framework were discussed with Government and private \nsector stakeholders in the course of 2005 in conjunction with the development of the country \nstrategy and program update (CSPU) and a visit to PNG in August 2005.5 Stakeholders have \nconcurred with the proposed impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and consultant terms of reference. The TA framework is in Appendix \n1.6 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Over the past 5 years, economic growth has barely kept pace with population growth. \nThe gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 2.6% in 2004 and is forecast to grow by 3.4% \nin 2006. The knock-on effects of this growth to the PNG economy is expected to be significant. \nHowever, the health of the economy depends largely on buoyant commodity prices, and the \ncurrent  enabling  environment  is  not  strong  enough  to  support  business  development  and \nbroader economic growth benefiting the population at large. The CSPU acknowledges that the \nchallenge of promoting an enabling environment for the private sector requires bringing about \ncritical changes to reduce obstacles to private sector activities and promote their expansion. \n                                                 \n1  PNG. 2004. Papua New Guinea Medium Term Development Strategy. Port Moresby. In part, contributed through \nADB technical assistance and ongoing policy dialogue, which has helped the Government analyze poverty and \ndevelop a strategic program to reduce it. \n2  In a 12 July 2005 speech on the state of the economy and budget by the minister for finance and treasury. \n3  ADB. 2003.

Manila). \n5  Inception mission for RETA 6202 (footnote 4). \n6  The TA project first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 7 July 2005. ", "2   \nThe  CSPU  also  states  that  private  sector  organizations  should  be  supported  to  increase \ndemand for reform and to strengthen the quality of dialogue with the Government. \n \n5.  PNG suffers an inability to translate public policy for the private sector into concrete and \nconsistent private sector development (PSD) reform action. As noted in the Government\u2019s \nMTDS, difficult country conditions prevail, including corruption, chronic political instability, weak \nmanagement capacity in the Government, an internal system of patronage, social conflicts and \npoor security, and small and isolated markets.7 Government action can alleviate impediments to \neconomic growth by providing the public goods and enabling environment necessary to promote \nprivate sector development. \n \n6.  The PSA concludes that the private sector is constrained by inefficient financial markets, \ninsufficient  physical  infrastructure,  inappropriate  legal  infrastructure  (including  regulation  of \nindustries), the state crowding out private business in certain sectors, insecurity of land tenure, \nand crime. Although the country is rich in natural resources, its economic development is \nhindered  by  very  low  population densities,  rugged  terrain,  complex  customary  land  tenure \nsystems, and poor human resource development. The PSD reform agenda is large and includes \nintractable  issues  caused  in  part  by  vested  political  and  business  interests  and  a  lack  of \nknowledge of PSD good practice among stakeholders. \n \n7.  PSA  recommendations  include  the  need  for  broad  policy  action  in  strengthening \neconomic policies, lowering business costs, integrating local markets, developing skills and \ntechnology, and prioritizing rural development. It recommends that ADB focus on the financial \nsector,  state-owned  enterprise  (SOE)  reform,  and  the  formation  of  appropriate  regulatory \nenvironments to lower the cost of doing business, reduce the drain on the treasury and pressure \non public management expertise, and alleviate the crowding out of the private sector. The PSA \nis a good platform for policy dialogue with decision makers and civil society, leading to reform \nroadmaps that select, prioritize, and implement reform measures. \n \n8.  Two principal bodies in PNG work on an agenda that covers a wide range of PSD reform \nactivities:  \n(i)   NWGIBI was established under the Department of the Prime Minister to identify \nand  propose  measures  to  remove  impediments.  It  is  chaired  by  the  chief \nsecretary and consists of stakeholder government agencies and representatives \nfrom private sector organizations. \n(ii)   The PNG Chambers of Commerce and Industry (PNGCCI), including chapters in \nPort  Moresby  and  Lae,  has  as  members  a  wide  range  of  private  sector \ncompanies. PNGCCI has good leadership, strong buy-in to its PSD agenda, as \nwell as a broad constituency that supports its agenda. However, it lacks the \nresources,  technical  capacity,  and  focus  to  follow  through  on  the  issues  it \naddresses. Technical assistance is needed that would help both NWGIBI and \nPNGCCI promote the PSD agenda. \n \n9.  A lesson learned from ADB\u2019s past support to PNG is that PSD-related projects should  \nnot  be managed  by  the  public sector.  PSD related  projects have  not  been  managed by the  \n                                                 \n7  The World Bank now classifies PNG as a non-core low income country under stress, characterized by weak \ngovernment and institutions, coupled with high levels of poverty.   \n ", "  3\npublic  sector  in  a  transparent  manner  or  in  line  with  project  agreements.8  An  innovative \napproach to project management is thus required, including an institutional set-up that puts the \ncivil service at arms-length from day-to-day project implementation. In addition, private sector \ntrade organizations have insufficient resources and capacity to follow through on PSD policy \ndialogue with the Government. Current efforts are mainly devoted to putting out fires as they \nflare up. An institutionalized capacity in PNGCCI for promoting good practice regarding PSD \npolicy is required.  \n \n10.  Support for the creation of an enabling business environment in PNG is fully consistent \nwith (i) Government strategies and policies; (ii) ADB\u2019s private sector development strategy;9 (iii) \nADB\u2019s Pacific Strategy 2005-2009, in which private sector development is a key pillar; and (iv) \nADB\u2019s CSPU for PNG. Support provided through TA will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing and \nplanned PSD-related activities10 and ensure linkages with the activities of other donors. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The proposed TA would contribute to increased private sector activity through a better \ninvestment climate and increased awareness and knowledge about the enabling environment \nfor the private sector. It will achieve this through policy dialogue and reform measures to create \na demand-driven enabling environment and increase stakeholders\u2019 awareness and knowledge \nof good practice in PSD. Reform activities will benefit both the poor and the formal commercial \nsector by improving (i) the legal and regulatory business environment; (ii) financial services; and \n(iii) the regulation, ownership, accountability, and performance of SOEs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  TA will attain its objectives through both policy dialogue and selected reform action plans \nthat can realistically be implemented within the TA period and provide a demonstration effect \nthat  will  contribute  to  momentum  for  PSD  reform.  TA  will  reach  beyond  the  Government \nbureaucracy and build buy-in and ownership with politicians, the private sector, and civil society \nthrough the NWGIBI. Demand for reform and the quality of dialogue between the private sector \nand the Government will be strengthened with the strategically well-positioned PNGCCI as the \nExecuting  Agency.  Given  the  difficult  country  conditions,  TA  will  be  opportunistic  in  its \nidentification of PSD reform activities through cultivating local ownership and support. As such, \nTA will be flexible in adapting to difficult and changing circumstances, accommodating changes \nand capitalizing on opportunities as they arise. \n \n13.  To attain the TA objectives, the following main activities will be undertaken:  \n(i)  Work  with  nongovernment  organizations,  civil  society,  NWGIBI,  and  other \nstakeholders to support the Government\u2019s MTDS. \n                                                 \n8  For example, Loan No. 1889-PNG(SF) (ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of \nDirectors on a Proposed Technical Assistance Loan to Papua New Guinea for the Nucleus Agro-Enterprises. \nManila) was managed under a public sector Executing Agency that has repeatedly been in violation of loan \ncovenants and is poorly managed. \n9   ADB. 2000.

Loan No. 1889-PNG(SF) Nucleus Agro-Enterprises (footnote 8), and the PNG gas project, programmed for \n2006. \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Build support for, prioritize, plan, and implement key activities to support PSD in \neach  PSD  focus  area:  (a)  the  legal  and  business  environment;  (b)  financial \nservices; and (c) the role of SOEs and the regulation of key sectors such as \npower, water, telecommunications, shipping and transport, and finance. \n(iii)  Conduct dialogue to disseminate the PSA, raise awareness, and address policy \nissues  through  workshops,  consultations,  and  one-on-one  meetings  with \nGovernment  officials,  political  leaders,  participants  in  the  private  sector, \nconsumers, and others. Use media coverage, seminars, presentations, and issue \npapers to cultivate demand and interest. \n(iv)  Through  training  and  capacity  building,  build  the  local  capacity  to  take  lead \npositions  in  good  practice  regarding  PSD  and  support  coordination  among \nprivate sector interests.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  TA  is  estimated  at  $1.25  million  equivalent,  comprising  $805,000 \nforeign exchange costs and $445,000 in local currency costs. ADB will provide $1.0 million grant \nfrom the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. PNGCCI will provide the \nremaining $250,000 in kind by covering office accommodation and support services. Detailed \ncost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  PNGCCI will be the Executing Agency and provide office space for TA. The selection of \nPNGCCI is based on an assessment of its strategic position and ownership of the development \nagenda. This partnership will help empower the private sector and instill best practice in private \nsector development. It will ensure intimate knowledge of impediments and constraints faced by \nthe private sector at large, as well as a suitable vehicle and entry point for dialogue with the \nGovernment. Stakeholder government agencies include the Department of National Planning \nand  Rural  Development,  Department  of  Treasury,  NWGIBI,  and  Investment  Promotion \nAuthority. Updating and disseminating the PSA is envisaged taking place under the ongoing TA \n6202-REG11 and contributing to this TA. \n \n16.  TA will require about 24 person-months of services from international consultants with \nprivate  sector  development  expertise  in  areas  including  (but  not  limited  to)  the  legal  and \nregulatory  business  environment;  financial  services;  and  SOE  regulation,  ownership, \naccountability, and performance. A consultant firm will be engaged following the quality-and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with the Guidelines of the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n17.  TA will begin in February 2006 and be implemented over 24 months until February 2008. \nSupport will be provided on an intermittent basis, the duration and frequency of which will be \nbased on identified needs and agreed with the consultant firm. Reporting will be on at least once \na  quarter.  The  consultants  will  report  to  the  ADB  private  sector  development  specialist. \nComprehensive policy dialogue with Government officials, private sector stakeholders, and the \ngeneral public will be required. Public dissemination of TA outputs will be sought to the extent \npossible.  \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2004.
