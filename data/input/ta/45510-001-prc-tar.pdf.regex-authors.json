INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) during the \nPRC country programming mission in December 2010, technical assistance (TA) for Strategies \nfor Green Jobs Creation and Promotion1 was included in the 2011 nonlending program of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  ADB  undertook  a  TA  fact-finding  mission  in  June  2011. \nAgreement was reached with the government, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry \nof Human Resources and Social Security (MOHRSS), on the TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, \ncosts and financing, implementation arrangements, and outline terms of reference for consulting \nservices. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  As a rapidly developing country with a large population and a fragile eco-environment, \nthe PRC is vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. In just three decades from 1978, \nthe PRC has become the world\u2019s second-largest economy, and such growth and expansion \nhave  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  country\u2019s  eco-environment.  The  government  has \nemphasized  the  need to  build  an  environmentally  sustainable  and  energy-efficient  society, \ntransitioning to a low-carbon economy and promoting green jobs2 under its Twelfth Five-Year \nPlan  (2011\u20132015).  The  government  has  taken  significant  steps  in  this  direction.  The \ngovernment\u2019s spending on  research  and  development  has  increased from  1.25%  of gross \ndomestic product in 2004 to 1.5% of a bigger gross domestic product in 2008.3 The solar \nindustry  in  the  PRC  is  gaining  importance  in  the  \u201cclean-tech\u201d  global  marketplace,  with  its \ninvestment across the clean technology sector reaching $13.5 billion in the third quarter of \n2010.4 The PRC is engaged in carbon trading through the Clean Development Mechanism, a \ncarbon emission credit system under the Kyoto Protocol. Local initiatives, from green growth \nincubators to eco-villages and to development of green cities are gaining traction in the PRC. \nThe central government has emphasized the importance of promoting green jobs, including \nintroducing the concept and raising awareness of green jobs among the government and the \npublic  through  advocacy  initiatives;  conducting  strategic  research  on  green  jobs  to  inform \npolicies and strategies, including issues of unemployment and redeployment; strengthening \nskills training for green jobs; and encouraging innovation in green and clean sectors to spur \ngreen employment.5 The government targets to create 2.2 million green jobs by 2020. \n \n3.  The recent global recession has emphasized the need for policy interventions aimed at \nencouraging recovery and renewed growth on more environmentally and socially sustainable \ngrounds.  There  is  a  growing  need  to  promote  job  creation  in  new  sectors  and  increase \nproductivity levels across all sectors, which will be the key driver of growth. This requires greater \ncohesion between the industrial, environmental protection, and employment promotion policies. \nThere is a need for a broad, integrated mix of policies in order to achieve strong green growth \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 20 June 2011. \n2  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines \u201cgreen growth\u201d as the pursuit of \neconomic  growth  and  development,  while  preventing  costly  environmental  degradation,  climate  change, \nbiodiversity  loss,  and  unsustainable  natural  resource  use.

Achieving  greener growth  and  a greener  economy  will  involve  not  only \nseizing  opportunities  to  develop  new  green  industries,  jobs,  and  technologies,  but  also \nmanaging  the  transition  for  greening  the  more  traditional  sectors  with  the  associated \nemployment and distributional effects. While there is a prospect of additional green jobs,6 the \nlong-term impact on employment is uncertain across most green growth scenarios. The costs \nassociated  with  green  growth  may  include  job  displacement  or  job  destruction  in  some \ntraditional industries. Some jobs will be substituted or redefined. Therefore, one of the main \nchallenges will be to facilitate reallocation of capital and labor across sectors while minimizing \nthe resulting adjustment costs. Adjustment risks entailed in the PRC\u2019s transition to a low carbon \neconomy,  particularly  on  job  losses  and  re-employment  due  to  market  failures  and  skill \nmismatches, will need to be analyzed. \n \n4.  Inclusive  green  growth  and  green  pathways  out  of  poverty.  In  light  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of building a harmonious society and given the nexus between climate \nchange, environmental factors, and poverty, it is important to assess how green jobs can serve \nas \u201cgreen pathways out of poverty.\u201d This involves seeing green growth within the national \npoverty reduction policy framework, assessing positive and negative impacts of green growth \nscenarios on poverty reduction, and stimulating participation of poor and vulnerable populations \nin the green economy. Anticipating and adapting to the social and economic effects of climate \nchange can involve widening employment opportunities, including for the poor, on a sustainable \nbasis.7 For instance, migrant workers in the PRC are among the most vulnerable to economic \nchanges and their job opportunities were affected by the global recession in 2009.8 Green jobs \ncould provide new opportunities for migrants. A pro-poor green jobs strategy needs to address \nthe issue of decent work (good jobs which offer adequate wages, safe working conditions, job \nsecurity, reasonable career prospects, social security benefits, and promotion of workers\u2019 rights) \nand the sustainability of job creation for lower-income groups and the poor, as well as its \nsystemic impact on the labor market. Furthermore, climate change has gender dimensions in \nboth urban and rural areas. Women, while accounting for less than 50% of all migrant workers \nnationwide, tend to concentrate in a narrow range of jobs and industries. For example, young \nwomen workers from other provinces dominate large manufacturing and processing plants in \ncoastal urban areas. Issues specific to women migrant workers must be systematically reviewed, \nand  green  jobs  strategies  must  be  tailored  to  their  special  needs.  Further,  monitoring  of \nemployment data by gender needs to be strengthened. \n \n5.  Training for green skills. There is a growing recognition that almost all jobs will require \ngreen  skills  to  some  degree  and  that  these  may  be  developed  incrementally.  While  the \ndevelopment  of  green  technologies  will  require  scientific  technological  engineering  and \nmathematic skills, many of the changes within jobs will require not novel or special skills but \nbetter generic competencies, such as environmental awareness; entrepreneurship; adaptability; \nand strategic, innovation, and marketing skills. This requires the strengthening of training and \n                                                \n6  United Nations Environment Programme. 2008.

Greater policy coherence will \nensure  that  both  economic  and  environmental  policy  objectives  are  supported  by  skills \ndevelopment.  The  skills  development  strategy  should  also  look  at  the  low-skilled  workers\u2019 \ninclusion in the changing labor market, mainly migrant workers who represent a large part of the \nlabor force. Some emphasis should also be placed on retraining versus new training needs and \non a tailored approach to retraining various target groups (e.g., by gender, age), given that local \ngovernments are attempting to shift their local economies and regular technical and vocational \neducation and training approaches often do not adequately address the emerging needs. The \nTA will assist the central government in the following specific areas: (i) analyzing the potential \nfor green jobs creation in the context of green growth; (ii) assessing linkages between green \ngrowth and poverty reduction by analyzing the potential for decent green jobs as \u201cpathways out \nof poverty\u201d for low-income and vulnerable groups, including migrant workers, women, and youth; \n(iii) assessing the gender dimensions of green jobs potential; (iv) fostering consultations among \nstakeholders to promote green jobs, including for the lower-income population and vulnerable \ngroups; (v) assessing training and retraining needs, including for vulnerable groups; and (vi) \nmaking policy recommendations for the creation and promotion of green employment under the \nTwelfth Five-Year Plan, to help the PRC accelerate its transition to a low carbon economy. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA is strengthened capacity of the government and other stakeholders \nfor promoting and creating green jobs in the PRC. The outcome will be a comprehensive \nanalysis and development of a preliminary national framework for promoting green jobs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA outputs will be (i) policy recommendations for promoting and creating green jobs \nat the national level, (ii) policy recommendations for promoting and creating pro-poor green jobs \nat  the  national  level,  and  (iii)  widely  disseminated  publications  on  key  TA  findings  and \nrecommendations. Creation of a national framework for green jobs requires that policies be \nexplored, developed, and promoted at the provincial level. Therefore, two provinces from the \nPRC\u2019s central and coastal regions (to be determined during TA implementation) will be selected \nas case studies to pilot assessment and development of green jobs policies. The TA activities \ninclude a desk study, interviews with government officials, surveys, field trips to the two pilot \nprovinces, seminars and workshops in Beijing, an overseas study tour, and a wrap-up green \njobs forum in Beijing. The desk study will review national and international experiences in green \njobs creation. Field work in pilot provinces will include visits to and surveys of key enterprises in \nselected  industries  and  organizations  and  interviews  with  officials  in  relevant  government \nagencies (e.g.,  Provincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Environmental  Protection \nBureau, Finance Bureau, Energy Office, Human Resources and Social Security Department, \nand Poverty Alleviation Department). Participants in an overseas study tour, who will include \nofficials from the central government who make and implement policies relating to green jobs \nand selected TA consultants, will be able to (i) observe good practices in a country with rich \nexperience in green jobs creation, and (ii) exchange experiences and lessons learned with \nofficials from other countries. The TA will facilitate consultations at the national and provincial \nlevel to support policy formulation on green jobs. Detailed consultations will be carried out with \nthe concerned stakeholders, including the private sector, employers\u2019 associations, trade unions, \nworker associations and representative groups, civil society, government agencies, research \ninstitutes, and international organizations. Workshops and a green jobs forum will serve as a \n ", "4   \nplatform for (i) sharing TA findings at various stages, (ii) getting feedback for improving TA work \nand findings, and (iii) building consensus among TA stakeholders on key recommendations for \ngovernment and private sector action. The TA will also establish a green jobs knowledge hub9 \nintended to facilitate information and experience exchange in green job strategies that can be \napplied within the PRC and elsewhere in the Asia and Pacific region. The TA outputs will \ninclude one main report and three subreports. \n \n8.  Main technical assistance report on green jobs creation and promotion. The main \nreport will include (i) an analysis of the PRC\u2019s current policies and regulations intended to \nachieve  green  growth  and  a  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy,  including  market-based \napproaches  and  regulations;  encouraging  investment  in  green  technologies;  and  fostering \ninnovation, investment in research and development, and skills development polices; (ii) a \nworking definition of green jobs, green growth, and green economy based on stakeholder \nconsultations during the TA workshops and seminars; (iii) an analysis of the long-term impact of \ngreen  growth  policies  on  employment,  including  job  displacement  and  job  destruction  in \ntraditional industries; (iv) an analysis of current and future employment patterns and skills \nprofiles in selected green industries and the restructuring of brown industries in the PRC; (v) an \nanalysis of potential job creation in selected industries and subsectors, such as modern service \nindustries; advanced manufacturing industries; strategic, high-tech, and emerging industries; \ntraditional industries; and agriculture in pilot provinces; (vi) a discussion of the policy conditions \nthat are needed for the development of green employment, including for the poor population; \nand  (vii)  recommendations  for  ways  to  achieve  greater  cohesion  between  the  industrial, \nenvironmental protection, and employment promotion policies. The main report should also \nprovide recommendations for policy, legal, regulatory, and administrative reforms. The main \nreport will review international experiences in green jobs creation and promotion. The three \nsubreports will be on: (i) Pro-poor green jobs policies. Topics will include (a) an analysis of \ngreen  jobs  creation  as  \u201cpathways  out  of  poverty\u201d  for  migrant  workers,  poor  women, \nunderemployed  youth, and  low-skilled  workers\u2019  inclusion  in the  changing  labor market,  (b) \nidentifying priority sectors where green jobs for the poor populations can be created,  (c) \nrecommendations for policies supportive of pro-poor green jobs. The subreport will also include \na gender analysis of job opportunities and training needs in the green economy, focusing on \nwomen migrant workers. (ii) Skills  training  and  capacity  building. Topics will include an \nassessment of implications for skills training and retraining and capacity building, including \nidentifying the required level of \u201cskills upgrade\u201d or \u201cskills shift\u201d; and identifying the training needs \nof  disadvantaged  groups,  including  low-income  migrant  labor.  Recommendations  for  skills \ndevelopment policies and management of training providers should be included. (iii) Green jobs \ncreation in the two pilot provinces. This subreport will be based on case studies of green jobs \ncreation in pilot areas (one in central and one in coastal PRC). Case studies will include visits to \nand surveys of key enterprises in selected industries and organizations and interviews with \nofficials in relevant government agencies in the pilot provinces. The subreport will provide labor \nmarket projections of green jobs in selected industries, using relevant methodologies. The \nconsultants will submit (a) the main TA report, (b) three subreports, (c) a policy note for decision \nmakers, (d) a summary report on the green jobs forum, and (e) an executive summary of the \nmain TA report. The policy note for decision makers, which presents key findings and major \n                                                \n9  The aim of the green jobs knowledge hub is to create knowledge and capacity to promote green jobs and to \nfacilitate knowledge sharing and awareness raising on green jobs in the PRC and in the Asia and Pacific region. \nThe green jobs knowledge hub will focus on peer group information exchange to develop good practice case \nstudies that can be applied to different contexts and can be disseminated to wider audiences. The TA will identify a \nsuitable institution to host the green jobs knowledge hub in its initial phase. As the green jobs knowledge hub \ndevelops, further approaches to knowledge exchange will be used and wider partnerships developed. \n ", "  5 \npolicy recommendations of the TA, will be shared with decision makers at the national and local \nlevels. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The government has requested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \ndomestic transportation, provision of communications facilities for consultants, and other in-kind \ncontributions. (See Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan.) \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  MOHRSS  will  be  the  executing  and  implementing  agency  for  the  TA.  An \ninterdepartmental working group will be set up within the ministry, comprising the International \nCooperation Department, Employment Promotion Department, Skills Development Department, \nand Policy and Legal Department. The working group will review inception, interim, and final \nreports prepared by the consultants. The TA consultants will incorporate the suggestions of the \nworking group into the final reports. Other relevant ministries and agencies will be regularly \nconsulted during project implementation. MOHRSS will provide the necessary office space, \ncounterpart staff, transportation, and other services to the consultants; and will arrange meeting \nappointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations. A total of 31.5 \nperson-months of consulting services (one international consultant for 4 person-months and six \nnational  consultants  for  27.5  person-months)  will  be  required.  The  TA  consultants  will  be \nengaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of individual consultants is considered \nappropriate because (i) green jobs is an emerging area in the PRC and the available pool of \ngreen jobs experts is limited; and (ii) the TA will likely have a strong impact on the development \nof future green jobs policies in the PRC and, therefore, requires high-quality technical inputs. \nConsultants will have expertise in (i) green jobs policies and implementation; (ii) employment \npolicies and a transition to a low-carbon economy; (iii) skills development and training; and (iv) \nsocial, poverty impact, and gender analysis. The national consultant and expert on green jobs \nstrategies will be the team leader. The consultants will be responsible for producing the TA\u2019s \noutputs and deliverables effectively and on time; and for organizing and carrying out all TA \nactivities including surveys, field visits, an overseas study tour, training, and workshops. The \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix  3. An advance payment facility will be \nestablished under the TA. All reports will be prepared in English and translated into Chinese. \nTranslation costs for project reports will be budgeted and allocated to the consultants. Major \nproject activities will be regularly monitored and reported to MOHRSS and ADB administrative \nmissions. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented \nover a 12-month period. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n11.
