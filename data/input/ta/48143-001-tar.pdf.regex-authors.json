INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  has  requested,  through  the \nASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF), technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  to  enhance  capacity  of  capital  market  regulators  and  continue  implementing \ninitiatives under the Implementation Plan 2015 for regional capital market integration.1 Regional \nand national consultations were undertaken at the ACMF meetings on 5 September 2014 and 3 \nMarch  2015,  and  a  series  of  national  consultations  from  September  to  November  2014, \nincluding meetings with the Securities Commission Malaysia, the current chair of the ACMF. \nThe  mission  reached  an  understanding  with  ACMF  members  on  the  objectives,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA.  \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Capital market development and integration are interrelated. Both share the objective of \neconomic growth though they contribute in different ways. Development provides the framework \nand  infrastructure  to  attract  investments  while  integration  provides  the  avenue  for  efficient \ncapital  movement  and  cross-border  investments  by  removing  barriers.  Capital  market \ndevelopment contributes to economic growth in at least three distinct ways: (i) by pooling and \nmobilizing savings for investment; (ii) by implementing international best practices in corporate \ngovernance thereby improving the efficiency with which firms allocate and utilize resources; and \n(iii) by diversifying and managing risk. Economic theory suggests that financial integration brings \nthe following benefits: (i) lower costs of trading financial assets; (ii) more diverse investor \nportfolios; (iii) reduced information asymmetry; and (iv) more stable consumption patterns. Thus, \nit is important for ASEAN capital markets to develop, and integrate.   \n \n3.  Despite  these  benefits,  the  disparity  in  capital  market  development  among  ASEAN \ncountries represents a challenge and may be a disincentive for integration. Cambodia Securities \nExchange only began operations in April 2012 with two listed companies, and the Lao Securities \nExchange started operations in 2011 and only has four listed companies. This is in stark \ncontrast to the more developed capital markets in the region. In addition, concerns about the \nslowing of the economy of the People\u2019s Republic of China, a potential rise in interest rates by \nthe United States Federal Reserve System and some nervousness about emerging markets \nhave caused volatility in ASEAN\u2019s equity markets during the second half of 2013 and in 2014. \nRegional  capital  market  integration  has  also  shown  mixed  results.  Intra-ASEAN  portfolio \ninvestment has been increasing since the global financial crisis\u2014the total investment of $24.8 \nbillion in 2010 surpassed pre-crisis total for the first time. However, intra ASEAN investment as \na percentage of total portfolio investment is still small, just slightly above 10%.3 More needs to \nbe done (i) to increase intra-ASEAN investment and to enable an investor from one ASEAN \ncountry to invest freely in another country; (ii) to provide an investor protection framework; and \n(iii) to promote ASEAN capital market integration and brand ASEAN as an asset class. The \nchallenge faced by ASEAN member countries is to develop their respective capital markets in a \nway that supports integration. \n                                                \n1  The ACMF comprises the heads of capital market regulators from 10 ASEAN jurisdictions and was established in \n2004 under the auspices of the ASEAN finance ministers. The ACMF initially focused on harmonization of rules \nand regulations before shifting toward more strategic issues to achieve greater integration of the region\u2019s capital \nmarkets  under  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  Blueprint  2015.  The  implementation  plan  is  available  at \nhttp://www.theacmf.org/ACMF/report/ImplementationPlan.pdf \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 February 2015. \n3 Calculation based on IMF\u2019s coordinated portfolio investment data survey.  \n ", "2 \n4.  ASEAN member countries have demonstrated strong commitment toward capital market \nintegration.  This  is  articulated  in  the  ASEAN  Economic  Community  Blueprint  and  ASEAN \nImplementation Plan 2015, prepared by ACMF and approved by the ASEAN finance ministers in \n2009.  The  ASEAN  Economic  Community  blueprint  provides  three  characteristics  of  an \nintegrated market, where within the region: (i) capital can move freely; (ii) issuers are free to \nraise capital anywhere; and (iii) investors can invest anywhere. The implementation plan is \nbased on three broad themes: (i) creating an enabling environment for regional integration;  \n(ii) creating the market infrastructure and regionally focused products and intermediaries; and  \n(iii)  strengthening  the  implementation  process.  ACMF  has  expressed  their  commitment  to \ncontinue integration initiatives based on the implementation plan, with the involvement of more \ncapital market regulators; and to strategize on deeper integration after 2015. All this requires \nbetter coordination between national capital market initiatives and the ASEAN regional agenda. \n \n5.  A stock take based on the ASEAN capital market scorecard shows that the following \ninitiatives have been adopted by at least three ASEAN countries: (i) substantial equivalence of \ndisclosure  standards  for  equity  offering  and  accounting  standards  (International  Financial \nReporting  Standards  and  auditors);  (ii)  an  expedited  framework  for  secondary  listings;  (iii) \ndevelopment of the ASEAN corporate governance ranking methodology; (iv) ASEAN Stars and \nASEAN website;4 (v) ASEAN trading linkage; (vi) fast-track debt offering for non-retail investors;  \n(vii)  substantial  equivalence  of  disclosure  standards  for  debt  offering;  (viii)  cross-border \ndistribution of mutual funds; (ix) facilitation of cross-border intermediaries (marketing services \nsupport for financial products); and (x) information and sharing and cooperation for enforcement. \n \n6.  Despite strong ownership of the regional capital market integration process, regulators \nespecially from Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar requested capacity building support as \nan essential element to move towards integration.5 Through the ACMF, potential exists for \nregulator to regulator cooperation in capacity building within ASEAN, which fosters regional \ncooperation and integration. Recognizing this need, the ACMF launched a new initiative\u2014the \nACMF Market Development Program (A-MDP)\u2014focusing on capacity building initiatives in the \nACMF meeting on 3 March 2015.6 \n \n7.  Some initiatives in which ADB has played a catalytic role require further support to make \nthem sustainable, in particular the ASEAN corporate governance scorecard and the ASEAN \ndispute resolution framework. The scorecard has been recognized beyond ASEAN as a good \nmodel, linking corporate governance and regional integration. In addition, to enable broader \nparticipation in ACMF\u2019s initiatives, regulators in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam require \nsupport focusing  on  prerequisites  for  capital market  integration.  For instance, most  ACMF \ninitiatives require participating regulators to be signatories to the International Organization of \nSecurities  Commissions  (IOSCO)  multilateral  memorandum  of  understanding  (MMOU) \nconcerning consultation and cooperation and the exchange of information. The Philippines\u2019 \nSecurities and Exchange Commission has applied to be a signatory to the MMOU in 2015 but \nthe  application  requires  further  support.  Legal  restrictions,  including  the  standard  of  proof \nrequired  to  obtain  bank  information  and  the  judiciary\u2019s  involvement  in  the  process,  are \nchallenges that need solutions. Regulators in Indonesia and Viet Nam will benefit from mapping \nthe  requirements  of  ACMF\u2019s  integration  initiatives  against  their  current  legal  and  market \ninfrastructure.7 Finally, it is necessary to review progress and plan for post 2015 in three areas: \n                                                \n4  ASEAN Stars are the top performing stocks in ASEAN. http://www.aseanexchanges.org. \n5  This was expressed in the ACMF meeting on 3 March 2015. \n6  During the launch of the A-MDP in the ACMF meeting on 3 March 2015, the ACMF welcomed ADB\u2019s participation.  \n7  In the March 2015 ACMF meeting, the ACMF requested ADB to lead a diagnostic study on the ASEAN exchanges \nincluding identifying benefits, risks, and impediments.  ", "3 \n(i) future capital market integration initiatives; (ii) a monitoring mechanism that helps inform the \nintegration  process  through  a  combination  of  quantitative  and  qualitative  indicators;  and \n(iii) branding and communicating capital market integration initiatives to a wider international \naudience.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The main focus of the TA will be to continue supporting members of the ACMF and the \nASEAN stock exchanges. This will be in the form of (i) building the capacities of regulators from \nCambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  and  Viet  Nam;  (ii)  supporting  members  to  complete  \ninitiatives in the implementation plan; (iii) supporting selected members to complete integration \nrequirements  that  enable  wider  participation  in  initiatives  of  the  Implementation  Plan;  and  \n(iv) supporting the ACMF and the ASEAN Secretariat in planning for deeper capital market \nintegration  after  2015,  which  may  include  revising  the  integrated  ASEAN  capital  market \nscorecard to be more relevant and inclusive. The ultimate beneficiaries of the proposed TA will \nbe the capital market regulators and stock exchanges of the ASEAN member countries.  \n \n9.  This proposed TA builds on outputs of the previous TA and should be seen as a \ncontinuation of ADB support for ASEAN regional capital market integration. ADB provided three \ntechnical assistance supporting ASEAN capital market integration, with the latest two focusing \non ACMF. The first TA in 2005 focused on diagnostic assessment.8 This was followed by a TA \nin 2008 which culminated in the submission of the implementation plan, endorsed at the 13th \nASEAN Finance Ministers Meeting on 9 April 2009.9 The plan sets out a broad framework to \nstrengthen ASEAN capital market development and integration by 2015. A subsequent TA was \napproved in 2010 to assist ACMF to implement initiatives in the implementation plan.10 Lessons \nfrom implementing previous TA projects include the following: (i)  capacity-building program for \nregulators from Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam should be structured and \nbased  on  best  practices  within  ASEAN;  (ii)  outputs  should  take  into  account  realistic \nexpectations of the capacities of the authorities; (iii) areas of support should focus on  the \nrequest of ACMF members and areas of ADB\u2019s experience; and (iv) TA implementation should \ninclude engagement with the private sector are incorporated. \n \n10.  The TA will link with ADB\u2019s national financial sector programs in Cambodia, Indonesia, \nthe Philippines, and Viet Nam in two distinct ways. First, through the A-MDP capacity-building \ninitiative, the TA can embed capacity-building support via a regional initiative supported by the \nhighest level of national capital market regulators. The A-MDP can be a focal point for ADB\u2019s \ncapacity-building support to Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam in capital market \ndevelopment, including initiatives originating from national programs and TA projects. Second, \nregional initiatives, such as the ASEAN corporate governance scorecard, dispute resolution \nmechanism,  and  IOSCO  application,  will  continue  to  be  part  of  national  financial  sector \nprograms as part of ADB\u2019s partnership with national regulators. For this TA, the Securities and \nExchange Commissions of Cambodia and the Philippines requested support for the IOSCO \nMMOU process, and Hanoi Stock Exchange requested support to map out the requirements to \njoin the ASEAN exchanges. The TA also provides ADB an opportunity to recommend the \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2005.

Other development partners and entities support national capital market development, \nparticularly in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Myanmar, and Viet Nam. For instance, Korea Exchange \n(national  stock  exchange  of  Republic  of  Korea)  has  supported  the  establishment  of  stock \nexchanges in Cambodia and the Lao PDR, while the Daiwa Institute of Research Group and \nJapan\u2019s  Tokyo  Stock  Exchange  are  supporting  the  setting  up  of  the  stock  exchange  in \nMyanmar.11  ADB, however, is the only development partner that is supporting capital market \nintegration at the ASEAN level. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact will be ASEAN capital market integration deepened. The outcome will be \nwider participation of ASEAN capital market regulators in regional capital market integration. \nThe ASEAN capital market scorecard maintained by the ASEAN Secretariat is the monitoring \nmechanism for the TA. The TA will support ACMF members to complete initiatives articulated in \nthe implementation plan, and to develop a strategy beyond 2015 to identify initiatives that will \npromote wider participation and deeper capital market integration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The first output will be improved capacities of regulators in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, \nMyanmar,  and  Viet  Nam  in  product  development,  issuance  process  (including  disclosure \nrequirements), and intermediaries\u2019 supervision. These important areas are prerequisites for \nintegration.  The  approach  for  capacity  building  will  consist  of  (i)  market  analysis  of  each \nbeneficiary country; (ii) a demand and supply analysis and (iii) coordination through ACMF\u2019s A-\nMDP initiative. The second output will be sustainable implementation of selected initiatives in \nthe  implementation  plan.  These  initiatives  will  include  the  ASEAN  corporate  governance, \nASEAN cross-border dispute resolution, and the ASEAN exchanges; all of which represent \ntangible  success  stories  of  ACMF\u2013ADB  partnership.12   Additional  support  is  required  to \nintroduce a verification process for the corporate governance ranking exercise and capacity \nbuilding of local dispute settlement institutions. The third output will be completion of capital \nmarket  integration  requirements  that  enables  wider  participation.  This  output  will  focus  on \ntechnical  prerequisites  of  integration,  such  as  supporting  ACMF  members  to  become \nsignatories  to  IOSCO\u2019s  MMOU  and  diagnostic  studies  to  map  out  the  requirements  of \nintegration initiatives. The final output will be roadmap for initiatives after 2015. This will likely \nentail refining the existing Implementation Plan 2015 to include initiatives beyond 2015, the \ndevelopment of monitoring mechanisms, and the communication of initiatives to investors and \nthe  private  sector.  Achieving  the  outcome  and  impact  of  this  TA  will  depend  on  some \nexogenous factors and mitigation of risks, including financial crisis, which reduces incentives for \ncapital  market  integration,  and  insufficient  capacity  to  participate  fully  in  capital  market \nintegration initiatives. Full details of activities, risks, and assumptions are in Appendix 1.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n11 Korea Exchange owns 45% of Cambodia Securities Exchange and 49% of Lao Securities Exchange. \n12 The proposed TA will introduce a verification process and set up a database for the Scorecard.  ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nInvestment  Climate  Facilitation  Fund 13  under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB. Activities in any participating country \nwill not be initiated under the TA until a no-objection is received from the government of that \ncountry. Appendix 2 shows the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency for this TA, which will be managed by the Southeast \nAsia  Department  (SERD)  in  coordination  with  the  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate \nChange Department (SDCC). The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division will \nlead  TA  implementation,  with  support  from  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division, especially where the ASEAN Secretariat is involved. SERD will also \ncoordinate with SDCC, which is involved with ASEAN central banking integration, to ensure a \nconsistent approach overall. Members of the ACMF and the ASEAN stock exchanges will be the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  ACMF  will  be  the  coordinating  body for  all  components.  The \nimplementation period will be 31 months from June 2015 to December 2017. The justification for \nthe longer implementation period is that regional integration initiatives are iterative and require \nmultiple consultations with authorities from different countries.  \n \n16.  The TA will require 50 person-months of international consulting services, including a \nfirm  to  coordinate  and  develop  material  for  output  1,  and  10  person-months  of  national \nconsulting services.  Engagement of the firm will be based on a quality and cost ratio of 80:20. \nThe national capital market expert will be based in ADB headquarters in Manila and assist in \nmonitoring indicators, facilitating seminars and workshops, and general research on capital \nmarket integration. When required, individual consultants should submit a final report to the \nACMF covering activities performed, assessment of the initiatives, and recommended future \nsteps. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). Terms of reference for all consultants are in Appendix 3.14 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration Financing Partnership Facility for Enhancing Association of Southeast Asian Nations \nCapital Market Integration, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n13 Established by the Government of Japan. \n14 To reduce the administrative burden and improve efficiency, all consulting services under the TA will be engaged \non output-based (lump-sum) contracts. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Reporting \nIndicators with Baselines  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact  By 2019:    Assumption \n ASEAN capital market  10% increase in total  ASEAN Secretariat and  Continued \nintegration deepened  intra-ASEAN investment   International Monetary  macroeconomic stability \n  (Baseline 2013:  Fund Portfolio   \n$24.8 billion)  Investment Survey  Risk \nExogenous economic \nshocks leading to \nfinancial crisis \nOutcome  By end of 2017:    Assumption \nWider participation of  Participation in ACMF  High-level support from \nASEAN capital market  initiatives to expand to  ASEAN finance \nregulators  in regional  more than 3 members  ministers and ACMF \ncapital market  (Baseline 2013: only   \nintegration  3 members participate in  Risk \nmost initiatives)  Inadequate capacity of \n  regulators to undertake \n90% of initiatives agreed  reforms required for \nin the capital market  integration \nscorecard completed by \n2015 and outstanding \ninitiatives rationalized \nafter 2015   \n(Baseline: 83% \ncompleted based on 2015 \nScorecard \nOutputs  By end of 2017:    Assumptions \n1.
