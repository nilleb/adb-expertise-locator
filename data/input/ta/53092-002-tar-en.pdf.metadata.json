THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation support \nand capacity building to a series of ensuing projects, comprising: (i) Northern Region corridor from \nWutung to Angoram (project 1) 1, (ii) Northern Region road corridor from Lae to Malalaua (project \n2) 2; and (iii) Highlands Region Road Improvement Investment Program, Phase 2 (project 3). All \nensuing projects are in the transport sector. To develop these projects, preparatory work in the \nform of feasibility studies, environmental and social safeguards work, financial management \nassessments, economic analysis, procurement assessment, and gender analysis will be required. \nThe TA is listed in the current county operations business plan (COBP). 3  \n \n2.  The Development Strategic Plan (DSP) 2010-2030 of the Government of Papua New \nGuinea (GoPNG) recognizes the northern region corridor as one of the most critical economic \ncorridors  in  Papua  New  Guinea  (PNG).  The  Northern  Region  Corridor  Program  has  been \nidentified as a priority investment in both the Medium-Term Development Plan III (MTDP III, 2018-\n2022) and the PNG National Road Network Strategy (2018-2037). The Northern Region corridor \nstarts at the Indonesian-PNG border at Wutung near Vanimo (capital of West Sepik Province), \nand extends southeast along the northern coast to Wewak (capital of East Sepik Province), \nAngoram and Madang (capital of Madang Province); then farther south via Lae (capital of Morobe \nProvince) and finally to Kerema (capital of Gulf Province) on the south coast of New Guinea island. \nThe total length of the Northern Region corridor is 1,457 km. It connects the ports of Vanimo, \nWewak, Madang, and Lae to the Highlands highway and the southern region corridor.  \n \n3.  The existing road along the Northern Region corridor is largely in very poor condition. \nSignificant parts are unpaved earth roads, and many of them are single lanes that need to be \nwidened to two lanes. The route includes three missing links: (i) Vanimo-Aitape (106 km), (ii) \nBogia-Angoram (101 km), and (iii) Wau-Malalaua (133 km). Vanimo and Wewak ports are \npotential hubs for palm oil exports, and are in poor condition and require upgrading in terms of \nchannel dredging, wharf extension and general infrastructure updates. Vanimo and Wewak have \nno customs facilities. Servicing international maritime trade from Vanimo and Wewak to Indonesia \nand beyond will play a key role in the economic growth of the northern coast area. The TA facility \nwill also support the proposed second phase of the Highlands Region Investment Program which \nwill improve about 400 km of the Highlands core network which is currently in poor condition. 4  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1. \n \n \n1  The project is also called Land and Maritime Transport and Trade Corridor Program. Tentative approval year is 2021. \n2  Tentative approval year is 2020. \n3  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Papua New Guinea, 2020\u20132022. Manila. The name of the TA in the \ncountry operations business plan is Preparing the Land and Maritime Transport and Trade Corridor Program. The \nname has been revised to be in line with the nature of the TA facility covering several ensuing projects. \n4  This program will be a continuation of the existing Highlands Region investment program. Tentative approval year is                             \n2020. \n \n ", "2   \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Delivery Dates  Key Activities with Milestones \n1.

In parallel with the TA facility, a separate project readiness financing (PRF) loan is being \nprepared. The PRF and TA facility will provide support for same ensuing projects concurrently. \nResponsibilities between PRF and TA facility have been provided in Table 2 below.  \n \nTable 2: Responsibilities for Preparation Activities of the Ensuing Projects \nPRF (to be \nPreparation activity   TA facility  implemented \nseparately) \nPreliminary design  Review   \nEnvironmental safeguards due diligence  Review   \nSocial safeguards due diligence  Review   \nEconomic analysis  Review   \nDetailed engineering design  Review   \nBidding documents  Review   \nRisk assessment     \nRoad Safety Audit     \nProcurement assessment     \nFinancial analysis     \nFinancial management assessment     \nSector assessment     \nClimate risk vulnerability assessment     \nGender assessment and gender action \n   \nplan \nPoverty and social assessment     \nPRF = project readiness financing, TA = technical assistance \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n6.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $2.5 million which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1.  \n  \n7.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, data and \ninformation access, facilitation of liaisons of stakeholders, and other in-kind contributions. The \ngovernment was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n8.  ADB will administer the TA. The Transport and Communications Division of the Pacific \nDepartment will engage, supervise and evaluate consultants. The Department of Works and \nImplementation (DOWI) and the Department of Transport of the GoPNG will be the executing \nagencies.5 The  Project  Implementing  Unit  to  be  established  under  the  DOWI  will  be  the \nimplementing unit. These agencies will provide necessary counterpart support, and guide the \nimplementation of the TA facility to achieve the outputs within the implementation period. \n \n9.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3. \n \n \n5 \u201cDepartment\u201d equivalents to \u201cMinistry\u201d in the PNG context. \n ", "4   \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2020\u2013December 2022  \nExecuting agencies  Department of Works and Implementation \nDepartment of Transport \nImplementing unit  Project Implementation Unit under Department of Works and \nImplementation \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: QCBS  Review of the Feasibility  $1,943,000 \n(90:10)a  Studies, and Detailed \nEngineering Designs, and \nPreparation of Due Diligence \nReports for Proposed Transport \nProjects \n  Individual:  International expertise (10.5  $457,000 \nindividual selection  person-months) \n  Individual:  National expertise (7 person- $100,000 \nIndividual selection  months) \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \na Due to the specializations required. \n \n10.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.6  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n11.  Since ADB is responsible for selecting the consultants, and disbursements in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), \nthe financial management, procurement and integrity risks during implementation of the TA facility \nare assessed to be low. Since the proposed activities consist of consulting services only, the TA \nfacility is not subject for categorization as per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \ntentative gender category for the ensuing projects is effective gender mainstreaming and the TA \nfacility has been categorized accordingly.  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n12.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding $2,500,000 on a grant basis to Papua New \nGuinea for preparing the land and maritime transport projects, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n \n \n \n6  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.
