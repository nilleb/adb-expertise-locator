The Drinking Water Supply, Wastewater Disposal and Sanitation Strategy (the strategy) \nof the Kyrgyz Republic has set ambitious targets for increasing access to potable water supply \nand improved sanitation.1 In rural areas, the goal is to reach 90% coverage for water services and \n70% coverage for sanitation systems by 2026. A countrywide assessment indicates that 651 out \nof 1,805 villages require new water supply systems, while 760 villages require substantial \ninvestments for system rehabilitation and expansion. Investment needs were estimated to be \n$600 million for water supply alone. Capital investments required to achieve sanitation coverage \nexpansion targets have not yet been reliably estimated and will depend largely upon the adopted \napproach for promoting rural sanitation development. \n2.  Proposed RBL Program. Asian Development Bank (ADB) is assessing the viability of the \nresults-based lending (RBL) modality to develop rural water and sanitation services provision for \n42 villages in Naryn Oblast. The indicative program scope will include: (i) development and \nrehabilitation of water supply networks and related infrastructure; (ii) piloting of non-networked \nsanitation  solutions;  and  (iii)  establishment  of  sustainable  operational  models,  including \ndevelopment of local professional and vocational capacity and community-based operational \nmanagement. \n3.  The proposed ADB financing will be aligned with the following impacts: (i) decent living \nstandards for each Kyrgyz citizen achieved, and (ii) health and quality of life improved and adverse \nenvironmental impact reduced by 2026,2 The program will have the following outcome: inclusive \nand reliable access to safe water supply and sanitation services in rural communities in Naryn \nOblast improved. The total ADB financing cost is estimated at $21.4 million. ADB will provide a \nloan of $10.7 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital lending and a grant of $10.7 million \nfrom the Asian Development Fund. The ensuing loan, grant and the transaction advisory technical \nassistance (TRTA) are listed in the ADB country operations business plan for the Kyrgyz Republic, \n2018\u20132020.3  \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.

The TRTA is required to conduct due diligence as required for the RBL modality, \nprepare the preliminary design of the program and assess the scope and scale for cofinancing \nand partnerships. The design and implementation of programs supported by the RBL include ex \nante assessments of the program and its systems, ex post results verification, and systematic \ninstitutional development. The TRTA will assess the soundness of the government\u2019s strategy, the \nState Program for Development of Water Supply and Wastewater Disposal in Settlements (2014\u2013\n2024)4 and there suitability as the basis for the proposed RBL program. \n \n5.  The  TRTA  will:  (i)  conduct  institutional  and  sector  analysis;  (ii)  undertake  fiduciary \n(financial management, procurement, and anticorruption), safeguard (social and environmental), \n                                                \n1  The strategy was approved on 26 March 2016 which defines key areas and activities in the development of water \nsupply and sewerage systems as well as measures required for conducting analysis and monitoring. It envisages \nimplementation of construction and rehabilitation of works of water supply system in 425 villages of the country.  \n2  ADB. 2018. Draft Concept Paper. Manila.
