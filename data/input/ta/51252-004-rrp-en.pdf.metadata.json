THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  to  the  Kingdom  of  Bhutan  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Financial  Market \nDevelopment  Program  (program),  and  (ii)  the  inclusion  of  subprogram  3  in  the  program \n(anticipated processing in 2021). The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) \nfor Strengthening the Financial Market Development Program, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program supports key policy reforms designed to address finance sector deficiencies \nin terms of institutions, markets and products, vulnerabilities caused by inadequate risk-based \nsupervision and concentration, and increased inclusiveness in the finance sector.1 The program \nutilizes a programmatic approach that aligns Asian Development Bank (ADB) support to key \ngovernment reform programs over the medium to long-term, to increase access to finance for the \nprivate sector and improve financial inclusion to enable economic diversification efforts in Bhutan. \nIn October 2019, the ADB Board of Directors approved the programmatic approach and a $30 \nmillion loan for subprogram 1 which was implemented from January 2018 to October 2019 was \nfinancially closed 31 May 2020 without any issues on record.2 Subprogram 2 is included in ADB\u2019s \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for commitment in 2020.3 The program is aligned \nwith the following operational priorities of Strategy 2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing  inequalities,  (ii)  accelerating  progress  in  gender  equality,  and  (iii)  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.4  \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  Programmatic approach and budget support. The program was originally designed to \ncomprise two subprograms, with the possibility of including a third. This approach allows ADB to \nhave an advisory role that ensures the relevant reforms are put into operation by the institutions \nconcerned and to pace its support for the government\u2019s reform efforts. Subprogram 2 was \nadvanced to 2020 from 2021 at the government\u2019s request. The processing of subprogram 2 in \n2020 facilitates the urgent requirement for domestic resource mobilization (first Treasury bond \nissued  in  September  2020),  and  improved  risk  management  of  financial  institutions.  The \nadditional subprogram 3 will help continue the reforms commenced under subprogram 1 and \ncontinued under subprogram 2 in key areas, with logical sequencing of successive policy actions \nand the development of new policy actions in related subcategories. Subprogram 3 will help \ncontinue the reform momentum, sustain the progress of reforms at key financial institutions, and \nintroduce new finance sector reforms.5 The program aims to achieve standards in the finance \n \n1  Independent Evaluation Department (IED). 2019.

Development problem. Economic diversification is a significant development problem for \nBhutan despite three decades of rapid economic growth averaging 7.0% ending fiscal year (FY) \n2018, coupled with a reduction in the national poverty rate from 23.0% in 2007 to 8.2% in 2017. \nHydropower contributes 25.0% to the gross domestic product (GDP). A decline in the production \nof electricity because of lower-than-expected rainfall and delays in the completion of hydropower \nprojects is likely to affect Bhutan\u2019s economy adversely.6 The unemployment rate was 2.7%, with \nyouth unemployment at 11.9%, as of the end of 2019. The government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, \n2018\u20132023 aims to diversify the economy by creating jobs and promoting the private sector.7 \nGrowth in the private sector has been sluggish because of inadequate access to finance. Banks \nin Bhutan rely on collateral and owner\u2019s equity for lending, which makes access to finance by \nmicro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSME) difficult. This is out of line with international \npractice, which places greater weight on financial assessments and credit history. \n \n5.  Economic Impact of COVID-19. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has \nsignificantly dampened growth prospects. An initial 30.0% reduction in direct tourism receipts from \nthe  daily  tariff  is  estimated  for  FY2020.  While  traditionally  a  strong  driver  of  growth,  the \nconstruction industry is facing a shortage of 21,568 workers because of entry restrictions. \nHydropower projects have been affected by work stoppages and labor unavailability. ADB \nprojects Bhutan\u2019s GDP growth to contract to 2.4% in FY2020 and 1.7% in FY2021\u2014the lowest in \na decade.8 Post-COVID-19 fiscal deficits are targeted at 6.2% of GDP in FY2020 and 7.4% of \nGDP in FY2021. ADB disbursed $20 million in May 2020, under its COVID-19 Active Response \nand Expenditure Support Program, to complement the government\u2019s pandemic response plan. \nThis support was intended to give short-term assistance and relief in terms of access to finance \nto the MSMEs, whereas subprograms 2 and 3 under the proposed program will continue to add \nlong-term budgetary support while achieving financial reforms. \n \n6.  Significant risks to finance sector post-COVID-19. The pandemic resulted in a sharp \nincrease in nonperforming loans (NPLs) as MSMEs struggled to meet debt repayments. NPLs \nwere high even prior to COVID-19 due to the rapid credit growth from FY2015 to FY2019 and \nconcentration in a few sectors like housing and tourism. Weakening bank balance sheets with \nhigh NPLs and a further breach in macro-prudential thresholds are expected.9 Although capital \nadequacy of banks is above the regulatory threshold, a decline is anticipated due to rising NPLs.10 \nNonbank finance segment is similarly challenged. Capital markets, which witnessed some growth \nin secondary trading in equity from January 2020 to February 2020, are expected to slow down, \nsignificantly wiping out recent gains. With an anticipated fall in dividend payouts in the corporate \nsegment, stock prices are expected to fall. A lower demand for new capital will result in a decline \nin fund-raising. Insurance companies\u2019 solvency has reduced as they now comply with RMA\u2019s new \nsolvency regulations effective from September 2019.11 \n \n \n6  World Bank. 2017.

Constraints in the finance sector impede the financial intermediation \nprocess. Finance sector constraints include (i) underdeveloped nonbank financial institutions, (ii) \ndeficient financial infrastructure, and (iii) the combined effects of low financial literacy and \ninadequate  financial  inclusion.  Removing  these  constraints  would  ensure  well-functioning \nfinancial  markets,  including  strong  institutions,  transparent  legal  structures,  and  rules  and \nregulations that cater to the latest requirements of electronic commerce, thereby helping to \nimprove financial inclusion and mobilization of domestic resources to meet development needs. \n \n8.  Nascent finance sector. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector architecture is dominated by the Royal \nMonetary Authority (RMA), which includes the electronic clearinghouse, the financial inclusion \nsecretariat, the consumer protection cell, and the central registry. The rest of the financial system \nis composed of the credit information bureau, the Bhutan electronic clearinghouse, the Royal \nStock  Exchange  of  Bhutan  and  the  depository,  the  Prospectus  Approval  Committee,  the \nAccounting Standards Board, and the Royal Audit Authority. Bhutan\u2019s financial system comprises \nfive banks, three insurance companies, and six microfinance institutions. The RMA regulates all \nfinancial institutions, including banks, insurance companies, pension and provident funds and \nmicrofinance institutions, and financial technology service providers. Measures on market depth \nlike credit to the private sector was 62.8% of GDP in March 202012 while the market capitalization \nwas 30.8% of GDP in March 2020.13 Detailed rules and regulations on bond issuance were \nachieved under subprogram 2, which enabled the first government bond issuance. The corporate \nbond  market  is  highly  illiquid.  The  Royal  Securities  Exchange  of  Bhutan  had  registered \n16 corporate bonds worth Nu8.66 billion as of December 2019.    \n \n9.  Dominant banking industry. Banks provided 75.5% of credit to the economy as of \nDecember 2019. The industry fully complies with Basel II prudential requirements and partially \nwith  Basel  III  capital  adequacy  requirements.  While  the  banking  segment  is  adequately \ncapitalized, loan asset quality has steadily deteriorated because of aggressive credit expansion \nduring 2013-2019. This led to high NPLs even before COVID-19 and the erosion of the capital \nbase from high levels, but still within regulatory requirements (footnote 10). Banks do not comply \nwith Basel III liquidity requirements but maintain statutory liquidity ratios which are more lenient \nthan Basel III. The industry\u2019s deposit base is predominantly short-term, but its loans are typically \nlong-term. Although banks generally provide 20-year fixed-rate housing loans, they are vulnerable \nto a rise in interest rates as banks run negative liquidity mismatches.14 This creates maturity \nmismatches, which were mitigated by a high current and savings account composition of 45.6% \nof total deposits as of December 2019.15 \n \n10.  Underdeveloped nonbank financial institutions. Bhutan\u2019s nonbanking financial system \nconsists of six microfinance institutions, two insurance companies, and one superannuation fund. \nThe bond and equity markets do not provide many investment opportunities to long-term saving \ninstitutions, such as the National Pension and Provident Fund and insurance companies, because \nof undeveloped capital markets. Like banks, insurance companies also create loan assets and \nfollow  similar  regulations  in  their  lending  business.  This  is  due  to  the  nonavailability  of \ninvestments. Bank lending relied heavily on housing before the Indian rupee crisis of 2012.16 \nHousing loans comprised 25.9% of finance sector credit as of December 2019 and posed \n \n12 Royal Monetary Authority, Annual Report, 2019, Bhutan.

According to the Bhutan Living Standards Survey Report, 2017, middle- and \nlower-income urban households spend an estimated 40.0%\u201260.0% of their disposable income on \nrent because of lack of affordable housing.17 The housing finance strategy approved by the \nMinistry of Works and Human Settlement under subprogram 2 addressed supply issues and \nfinancing options, including gender-based solutions. The housing finance strategy contained \nrecommendations on fiscal measures and incentives such as taxes, and other incentives to \nsuppliers and house builders.  \n \n11.  Developing the financial infrastructure. The RMA, Office of Registrar of Companies, \nMinistry of Economic Affairs (MoEA) and the Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan need to build \ntheir capacity to make surveillance more efficient. The concentration of regulation may be \nappropriate, given the size of the financial system, but a gradual reduction of concentration is \nbetter to develop strong institutions. The Prospectus Approval Committee (PAC), under Office of \nthe  Registrar  of  Companies  and  MoEA,  performs  the  functions  of  a  securities  exchange \ncommission. The PAC is envisaged to be upgraded to a regulatory body under chapter 14 of \nCompanies Act, 2016. In its 2018 follow-up report on the 2016 mutual evaluation report on Bhutan, \nthe Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) rated the country\u2019s effectiveness low both for \nthe  regulator  (the  RMA)  and  for  financial  institutions\u2019  compliance  with  anti-money \nlaundering/combating the financing of terrorism requirements.18  \n \n12.  Low financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. Bhutan\u2019s finance sector has \nbeen growing rapidly. The ratio of private sector credit to GDP increased from 15.4% in 2005 to \n62.8% in March 2020. As of December 2018, 64.0% of adults in Bhutan held savings accounts \nwith a composition of 58.0% men and 46.0% women. Only 16.8% of adults had access to credit, \nof which 65.0% were men and 35.0% were women. Banks still assess loan requests against \ncollateral, which restricts women\u2019s access. Similarly, of the 18.0% of adults with insurance, 52.0% \nwere men and 48.0% were women for life insurance.19 Many rural communities lack access to \nformal remittance services.20 Therefore, the benefits of modern electronic and online payment \nsystems have yet to reach all, and cash still dominates the payment system.21 Rules and \nregulations on consumer redress giving protection to users of financial products and services like \ndisclosures helped educate consumers to make effective and informed financial decisions. In \naddition, the redress mechanism helped to implement effective and impartial dispute resolution.  \n \n13.  Further  financial  inclusion  improvements  required  in  rural  areas.  Some \nimprovements  have  been  made,  with  the  establishment  of  microfinance  institutions,  the \nintroduction of digital services, the use of bank agents, the introduction of priority sector lending \nand financial literacy programs, and the imposition of a minimum lending rate in 2016. The \nNational CSI Development Bank, a specialized bank to cater to financing needs of the micro and \nsmall industries was established on 22 February 2020. It was earlier known as Rural Enterprise \nDevelopment Corporation Limited and the Tarayana Foundation launched the Tarayana Micro \nFinance for Rural Development program to meet the financial needs of rural communities on 20 \nFebruary 2020.22 However, financial inclusion remains inadequate because of limited access to \nfinance. Rural borrowers rarely have any means of recourse if bank staff act improperly. \n  \n \n17 Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan. 2018. State of the Financial Inclusion Report 2018.

The program will support the government in its commitment \nto continue reforms to make the finance sector more responsive to emerging priorities, while \nremaining stable and inclusive. This support is critical for the government to achieve national key \nresult  areas  of  the  Twelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023,  such  as  macroeconomic  stability, \neconomic diversification, improving access to finance, and poverty reduction (footnote 7). The \ngovernment has prepared several long-term sector development strategies. In 2017, it approved \nthe Financial Sector Development Action Plan, which details reform actions that affect, among \nothers, the banking system, nonbank financial institutions, and financial inclusion and financial \nliteracy.23 By using a programmatic approach, the program targets reforms in the nonbanking and \nfinance segment and promotes financial inclusion to ensure an increased role for the private \nsector in Bhutan\u2019s economy. Transaction TA to deliver policy actions strengthened subprogram 2. \n \n15.  Risk-based surveillance introduced under reforms. The Macro-Prudential Regulations \nwere adopted in 2018. In 2019, risk management guidelines were issued by the RMA to provide \nminimum standards in risk mitigation at financial institutions and to ensure adoption of a sound \nrisk  management  framework.24 In  addition,  directives  on  risk-based  solvency  and  capital \nrequirements were issued by RMA for insurance and reinsurance companies in Bhutan in \nSeptember 2019.25 The RMA received support under reform area 2 of subprogram 2 on revised \nprudential guidelines to help introduce risk-based supervision and introduce relevant directives to \nfinancial institutions.  \n \n16.  Policy reforms proposed through the program. Policy reforms in the areas of the \nnonbank financial system, strengthening of the finance sector, and financial inclusion will continue \nto  be  delivered  under  subprogram  2.  When  subprogram  1  was  approved,  only  one  other \nsubprogram (subprogram 2) was envisaged (footnote 2), but a third subprogram is now proposed \nwith further policy actions in the three reform areas (paras. 17\u201319). The revised post program \nengagement framework after subprogram 3 will ensure the continuity of the financial market \nsector reforms in several areas. Each subprogram is a single tranche intervention. These are \npresented in detail in the government\u2019s Development Policy Letter (Appendix 3) and the Policy \nMatrix (Appendix 4). \n \n17.  Reform area 1: Nonbank financial systems developed. This reform area is designed \nto develop Bhutan\u2019s capital markets, insurance, housing, and pension segments.26 Subprogram 1 \ndeveloped a strategy for bond issuance, and policies on new housing financing and pensions. \nUnder subprogram 2, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) approved detailed rules and regulations to \nissue government bonds and has issued the first government bond in September 2020 (maturing \nin 3 years).27 The MOF approved a pension strategy to cover private sector employees and the \nself-employed, of whom women comprise 61.0%.28 Subprogram 3 will concentrate on secondary \nmarket development and an insurance strategy, including alternative investments and housing \n \n23 Government of Bhutan, RMA.

Required revisions to existing rules on equity and debt issuances are included. \n \n18.  Reform area 2: Stability and integrity of the financial system strengthened. Although \nthe RMA has made improvements in the direction of risk-based monitoring, high NPLs remain a \nconcern. Under subprogram 1, the RMA instituted risk-based bank supervision, including stress \ntesting,  and  designed  templates  for  institutional  risk  profiles  and  risk  assessment  that  will \nsignificantly assist RMA supervision. Under subprogram 2, the reforms were continued in the \nareas of risk assessment, with emphasis on credit and cybersecurity risks, and the inclusion of \nthe International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9 in prudential requirements.29 All financial \ninstitutions operationalized an online anti-money laundering reporting system. Subprogram 3 will \nfocus  on  implementing  the  IFRS  9,  revised  rules  on  anti-money  laundering  based  on \nrequirements, and full alignment with Basel III, leading to enhanced stability, efficiency, and \ninclusiveness in financial markets. This will also lead to increased compliance with both risk-based \nsupervision and compliance. Further, NPL management strategy will be a focus to reduce NPLs \nand improve risk management. \n  \n19.  Reform area 3: Financial inclusion promoted. Under subprogram 1, the RMA approved \nthe National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS), 2018\u20132023 and the National Financial Literacy \nStrategy (NFLS), 2018\u20132023.30 Under subprogram 2, the RMA approved an action plan for the \nNFLS 2018\u20132023 and the NFIS 2018\u20132023 that included (i) identifying the responsible agencies \nand clear timelines for developing a gender-responsive and socially inclusive financial literacy \nprogram; (ii) conducting surveys on demand and use of financial products by women and various \ngroups; and (iii) ensuring data and analysis are disaggregated by sex. In addition, the RMA \nestablished a consumer redress mechanism under the Consumer Protection Financial Services \nRules and Regulations, 2019 to provide redress to aggrieved consumers, promote fair trade \npractices, and empower and enhance consumer confidence in financial services. The RMA \napproved  an  inclusive  green  finance  road  map  in  2020  to  promote  access  to  finance  for \nentrepreneurs seeking funding for environment-friendly projects. Subprogram 3 will focus on \nfinancing inclusive green finance and financial technology to promote digital inclusion. \n \n20.  Post program engagement framework. The framework was included to facilitate a \nstructured dialogue over 5\u201310 years on finance sector reforms between ADB, the MOF, and the \nRMA. A third subprogram is proposed, drawing on the post program engagement framework, \nincluding new areas such as the securitization of finance sector assets and developing the fintech \nregulatory framework. Key activities under subprogram 3 that require further dialogue to promote \nsustainability include (i) developing debt and equity capital markets; (ii) improving the insurance \nsegment by formulating an insurance strategy using amendments to the Financial Services Act \n2011; (iii) developing specific plans for affordable housing, including implementation measures to \naddress women\u2019s constraints in accessing housing finance; (iv) widening the scope of risk \nprofiling and assessment of financial institutions, in compliance with Basel III; (v) developing \nstrategies to ensure consumer protection; and (vi) ensuring timely implementation of the NFIS \nand the NFLS, with specific gender elements. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s experience. ADB has been a long-standing partner in Bhutan\u2019s development since \n1982. The Bhutan\u2013ADB partnership in the finance sector began in 1984, with the provision of the \n \n29 The Accounting and Auditing Standards Board of Bhutan signed an agreement with the IFRS Foundation to adopt \nthe IFRS in a phased manner (phase 1 for 2013\u20132015, phase 2 for 2016\u20132017, and phase 3 for 2018\u20132019), aiming \nfor full adoption and compliance by 2021. \n30 Government of Bhutan, RMA. 2018.

Since then, \nBhutan has been reforming its finance sector, which deepened and expanded by about 14.0% \nannually in terms of assets from December 2014 to December 2018. The validation report of the \nIndependent Evaluation Department (IED) of the country partnership strategy final review, 2014\u2013\n2018 recommended continued support to finance sector reforms in Bhutan. ADB has proven that \na key strength is the high level of continuity through an advisory role, in supporting Bhutan, in its \ncore sectors.32 \n \n22.  Lessons.  The  program  has  drawn  on  lessons  from  ADB\u2019s  previous  policy-based \nprograms that supported finance sector reforms.33 The design of subprogram 2 is also based on \nthe achievements and lessons of ongoing TA projects. Subprogram 2\u2019s policy actions revealed \nthat issuance of a Treasury bond would help establish a yield curve and risk premiums to develop \nthe market for future issuances. Risk assessment policy actions revealed that compliance with \nthe international accounting standards was a significant need, as financial institutions were not \naligned with best practices to manage risks. Further, the expansion of pension coverage was a \npolicy action central to the developments in the insurance and capital market segments, and \ntimely because Bhutan is experiencing a demographic dividend.34 The reform actions under the \nprogram have been prepared to help the government realize its capacity to improve cybersecurity \nin Bhutan. IED\u2019s validation report noted that efforts to diversify the economy cannot be sustained \nwithout  accompanying  public  sector  management  and  finance  reforms  that  strengthen \ngovernance (footnote 1). \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s value addition to the program. ADB\u2019s value addition has been to support the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda through a strategic framework; informed policy dialogue; evidence-\nbased studies; and sequencing and pacing of reforms, particularly in planning and coordinating \nvarious elements of reforms. The \u201cOne ADB\u201d approach has been implemented more effectively \nsince 2017, when ADB\u2019s Bhutan Resident Mission expanded and undertook core tasks in country \noperations. Greater field presence and staff strength have enabled ADB to be more responsive \nto client needs and emerging issues, in coordination with ADB experts from the South Asia \nDepartment and other departments, including the Economic Research and Regional Coordination \nDepartment; Office of Anticorruption and Integrity; Office of the General Counsel; Office of Public\u2013\nPrivate  Partnership;  Office  of  Risk  Management;  Procurement,  Portfolio  and  Financial \nManagement Department; Private Sector Operations Department; Treasury Department; and \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department. A programmatic approach with two \nsubprograms was approved in 2019 to enable ADB to stay engaged and help the government \nimplement effective long-term reforms. \n \n24.  Development partner coordination. The involvement of development partners in the \nfinance sector is well defined.35 Access to credit was identified as one of the major critical \ndevelopment constraints in a diagnostic study on Bhutan that ADB prepared with the Government \nof Australia and Japan International Cooperation Agency.36 The government adopted its Capital \n \n31 ADB. 2014.

In  the  same  year,  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) \nestablished the South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Center for economic \ncapacity building in New Delhi and is helping the government set up a liquidity forecasting \nframework. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n25.  The program will support the government with institutional reforms to assist economic \ndiversification, while improving the technical capacity of regulatory and financial institutions. The \ninclusion of subprogram 3 will have further impacts, which have been introduced as additional \nperformance  indicators  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (DMF)  (Appendix  1).  The \nprogram\u2019s impacts on macroeconomic stability achieved, economic diversity and productive \ncapacity enhanced, and poverty eradicated, and inequality reduced is aligned with Bhutan\u2019s \nTwelfth  Five  Year  Plan,  2018\u20132023.  The  effect  of  the  reform  is  stability,  efficiency,  and \ninclusiveness of the finance sector enhanced. This will be measured by the following indicators:(i) \nall  bonds  issued  from  2018  to  2023  increased  by  6.0%,  reaching  Nu9.3  billion  (about \n$127 million);38 (ii) the year-on-year growth of private sector credit provided by commercial banks \nincreased from 14.7% in 2017 to at least an average of 17.0% for 2019\u20132023; and (iii) adults with \naccess to credit reached at least 20.0% by 2023 compared with the 16.0% baseline of 2018. \nAdditional DMF indicators could be added in the financial inclusion area, strengthening gender \nelements, with a suitable assessment of the post-COVID-19 impact on financial access.39 The \nfinance sector has achieved compliance with the IFRS 9, partial compliance with Basel III, and \nthe operationalization of anti-money laundering/combating the financing of terrorism compliance. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n26.  The total expenditure for the Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u20132023 is estimated at Nu310 \nbillion (about $4.3 billion), an increase of 38.0% from the previous five-year plan. The external \nfinancing gap over the 5-year period was estimated at Nu29 billion (about $400 million). However, \npost-COVID-19, the estimated external financing gap over the 5-year period was revised to $541 \nmillion from $406 million with the largest deficits concentrated in FY2020 and FY2021. The post-\nCOVID-19 financing gap of the government in FY2020 at 6.2% of GDP was estimated at $158.1 \nmillion.  Budget support was provided by (i) World Bank $55.0 million (ii) ADB\u2019s COVID-19 \nPandemic Response Option (CPRO) loan $20 million and (iii) ADB\u2019s FMDP subprogram 1 $30 \nmillion totaling $105 million. Financing gap of FY2021 is estimated at 7.4% of GDP at $203.9 \nmillion. This loan of $30 million under subprogram 2, will partially support the FY2021 deficit \n(footnote 3). The deficits in both FY2020 and FY2021 of $53.1 million and $173.9 million \nrespectively will be financed through domestic Treasury bonds and Treasury bills within FY2020 \nand FY2021. \n \n27.  The loan amount for subprogram 2 is $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2. The loan has a 24-year term, including a grace period \n \n37 ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Capital Market Development. Manila. \n38 The impact of COVID-19 will affect the pace of issuance, as the government will seek to manage the fiscal deficit \nwith both international and domestic borrowings. \n39 Potential DMF indicators include (i) the coverage of women with specific loan products/risk assessment in the area \nof housing finance, (ii) the implementation of gender targets under financial literacy and financial inclusion policy \nactions, and (iii) ensuring the interests of women are specifically covered in consumer redress mechanisms used by \nfinancial institutions.  \n ", "9 \nof 8 years; an interest rate of 1.0% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. In addition, the \ngovernment of Bhutan has requested a concessional loan of $30 million from ADB\u2019s concessional \nordinary capital resources for subprogram 3. The IMF confirmed that the letter issued in April \n2020, in which Bhutan was assessed to have a moderate risk in the 2018 IMF\u2013World Bank debt \nsustainability  assessment  based  on  the  post-COVID-19  pandemic  assessment  of  Bhutan\u2019s \nmacroeconomic conditions, prospects, and policies, could be used for subprogram 2.40 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n28.  The MOF is the executing agency, and the RMA and the Ministry of Works and Human \nSettlement are the implementing agencies. A steering committee, chaired by the secretary of the \nMOF and established under subprogram 1, will continue to guide and monitor the implementation \nof subprogram 2. The proceeds of the policy-based loan will be withdrawn in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) in a single tranche. \nThe  implementation  period  is  November  2019\u2013November  2020  for  subprogram  2,  and \nsubprogram 3 is expected to be implemented from December 2020 to March 2022. All policy \nactions accomplished under subprogram 1 remain effective. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n29.  The TA is estimated to cost $525,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6)  and  Financial  Sector  Development \nPartnership Special  Fund.41 The TA will be implemented over 15 months from December 2020 \nto March 2022 to support financial inclusion activities and post program engagement activities \nunder subprogram 3.42 Individual consultants will be engaged. The TA under subprogram 2 will \nprovide significant support to implementing reforms. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport. Consultants will be recruited following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be made following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis  classified  category  C  for  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous  peoples \nsafeguards. It is not expected to have any environmental or social safeguard impacts following \nthe definition of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.43 Counterpart support will be in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office and housing accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, \ndomestic transportation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n31.  Poverty  and  social.  Bhutan\u2019s  limited  financial  market  development  has  had  a \ndisproportionate impact on the poor. Only 25.0% of adults in the poorest 40.0% of households in \nBhutan have a bank account, while the rate in other developing economies is 50.0% based on \n2014 data (footnote 17). Further, as of December 2019, although 67.6% of adults in Bhutan had \na  savings account,  only  19.7%  had  access  to  credit  and  19.6%  held  an  insurance policy \n(footnote 17). \n \n \n40 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 Established by ADB.

Gender  elements.  The  program\u2019s  objectives  and  activities  align  with  the  goal  of \nadvancing gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment by improving women\u2019s access to financial \nresources. The program includes three gender-related policy action areas: (i) the housing finance \nstrategy will focus on addressing demand-side factors related to women in providing access to \nhousing finance, (ii) financial inclusion actions will support the collection of sex-disaggregated \ninformation and data to assess levels of financial awareness, and (iii) the development of financial \nproducts and services will address the financing needs and constraints faced by women. The \nprogram is categorized some gender elements. \n \n33.  Governance.  Bhutan\u2019s  financial  management  risk  is  moderate.  The  2016  public \nexpenditure and financial accountability assessment reported improvements from the previous \nassessment (2010).44 The lowest scores were given for accounting and reporting, government \ntransparency, and budget reliability. The government has implemented four of the five reform \nmeasures. These measures are the public expenditure management system and the integration \nof the civil service information system with the payroll system.45 Bhutan consistently scores high \non global indexes for control of corruption, ranking 25th out of 180 countries in Transparency \nInternational\u2019s  2019  Corruption  Perceptions  Index.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government and the MOF. \n \n34.  Risks and mitigating measures. Major risks and mitigating measures are described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.46 \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n35.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the program shall conform to \nall applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \nagreement. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $30,000,000 to the Kingdom of Bhutan for subprogram 2 of the \nFinancial Market Development Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nconcessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per year during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per year thereafter; for a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \nand \n(ii)  the inclusion of subprogram 3 in the programmatic approach, as described in para. \n3. \n \nMasatsugu Asakawa \n  President \n6 October 2020  \n \n44 World Bank. 2010.
