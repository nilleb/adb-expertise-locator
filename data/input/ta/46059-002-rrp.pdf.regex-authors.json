THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) for subprogram 2 of the \nGovernance and Capacity Development in Public Sector Management Program (GCDPSMP).1 \nThe program supports the strategy of the government of the Lao PDR to strengthen public \nsector governance to achieve sustained and inclusive economic growth. The program is aligned \nwith  the  government\u2019s  Seventh  Five-Year  National  Socio-Economic  Development  Plan \n(NSEDP7),  2011\u20132015,  which  makes  the  establishment  of  an  accountable,  effective, \ntransparent,  and  responsive  public  administration  to  strengthen  service  delivery  a  key \ndevelopment objective.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n2.  Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the Lao PDR has been steady since 2010 and \naveraged  8%  during  2010\u20132013  largely  due  to  relatively  accommodative  macroeconomic \nenvironment that was supported by a resource boom, rapid credit expansion, and robust foreign \ndirect investment inflows, particularly in the hydropower and mining sectors. This growth is \nexpected to moderate to 7.3% in 2014 and 7.4% in 2015. While the proportion of the population \nliving below the poverty line declined from 27.6% in 2008 to 22.9% in 2012 and progress toward \nachieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) also accelerated, the country still faces \nsignificant  challenges  in  delivering  efficient  and  equitable  education  and  health  outcomes. \nDespite an increased spending on education and health services during 2012\u20132014, budget \nresources  are  grossly  inadequate  when  compared  with  the  needs  identified  in  sector \ndevelopment plans.3 This is largely due to rising fiscal pressures: budget deficit rose from 1.5% \nof GDP in FY2012 to 5.8% of GDP in FY2013,4 but is expected to go down to 4.2% of GDP in \nFY2014  and  4.4%  of  GDP  in  FY2015.5 In  addition  to  the  growing  public  sector  resource \nconstraint, inadequate public sector management (PSM) systems and capacity, especially at the \nlocal government level, also greatly lower the effectiveness and quality of delivery of public \nservices in general and in delivery of pro-poor programs in particular.6 \n \n3.  The government views a well-functioning public financial management (PFM) system as \na critical fundamental for ensuring fiscal discipline, spending efficiency, and macroeconomic \nstability.  The  NSEDP7  emphasizes  the  clear  link  between  good  governance  and  broader \n                                                \n1\n The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 Government of the Lao PDR (Ministry of Planning and Investment). 2011. The Seventh Five-Year National Socio-\nEconomic Development Plan (2011\u20132015). Vientiane. \n3 In 2012, the National Assembly passed a resolution mandating the government to allocate 9% of total spending to \nthe health sector and 17% of total spending to the education sector during the FY2013. \n4 The wage-bill-to-GDP ratio rose from 5% in FY2012 to 9.5% in FY2013 due to large increases in civil service \nwages, including provision of a monthly allowance, as well as an increase in the number of public employees. To \ntame fiscal pressures, the government cancelled a cost-of-living allowance for the civil service in FY2014 and \npostponed some infrastructure projects. The government has stopped a third hike in civil service wages planned for \nFY2015 and has directed banks to curb lending for public infrastructure. Spending on new projects is expected to \nremain constrained for several more years. \n5  Estimates of budget deficit in FY2014 and FY2015 are from the IMF\u2019s preliminary conclusions of the Article IV \nmission, 26 October 2014. \n6  Poor public service delivery has also affected gender equality: of 151 countries on the 2014 gender inequality index \nof the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Lao PDR was ranked 118th. UNDP. 2014. Human \nDevelopment Report 2014\u2014Sustaining Human Progress: Reducing Vulnerabilities and Building Resilience. New \nYork. \n ", "2 \n \ndevelopment effectiveness. The draft strategic plan on governance for 2011\u20132020, prepared \nwith support of UNDP, aims to make the state function more efficiently by improving people\u2019s \nparticipation, public service delivery, the rule of law, and PFM.7 The National Governance and \nPublic Administration Reform Program (NGPARP) for 2011\u20132015, which builds on the draft \nstrategic plan on governance, seeks to ensure the foundations of an effective, accountable, and \nresponsive public administration. The midterm review of the NSEDP7 in 2013 identified several \npriority actions and measures needed to strengthen public sector governance reforms and \nsustain them during the next national socioeconomic development plan period in 2016\u20132020. \nThe GCDPSMP, which was approved in September 2012, supports government\u2019s reforms in \npublic financial management and public administration during 2010\u20132014 in an integrated and \ncoordinated manner within the NGPARP framework.8 \n \n4.  The  pace  of  PSM  reforms  has  been  influenced  by  the  implementation  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s overarching public sector reform\u2014the Sam Sang initiative. It was launched in \n2012 on a pilot basis that covers all 17 of the country\u2019s provinces, 51 districts, and 108 focal \nvillages  nationwide  and  aims  to  empower  provinces,  districts,  and  villages  to  make  public \nservice delivery more effective and efficient.9 Government evaluation of the Sam Sang pilot \ninitiative  is  expected  to  be  completed  in  late  2014.  Overall,  the  Sam  Sang  initiative \nimplementation  is  expected  to  sustain  reforms  supported  under  the  GCDPSMP,  such  as \nadequate  spending  on  health  and  education,  new  intergovernmental  fiscal  transfer \narrangements, and strengthening of the civil service capacity building framework. \n \n5.  In parallel, the government continues to facilitate a gradual transition to a private sector-\nled market economy. It aims to increase domestic and foreign direct investment, particularly in \nthe agriculture, education, and health sectors. The goals are to achieve GDP growth of at least \n8%  annually  over  the  medium  term  and  address  the  financing  gap  under  NSEDP7.  The \ncountry\u2019s  accession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  in  February  2013  was  particularly \nimportant to this effort, since this will allow the Lao PDR to build on and accelerate trade-related \nPSM reforms. These reforms will help diversify the country\u2019s exports and spur investment in \nmanufacturing  that  can  gradually  shift  trade  and  investment  flows  from  their  current \nconcentration in the natural resource sector. The World Bank\u2019s Doing Business shows business \nenvironment improvement in such areas as strengthening legal rights of borrowers, lenders, and \nminority investors.10 The Lao PDR is also positioned well to benefit from the growing global \ntrend of South\u2013South investment. The government is committed to the goal of graduating from \nthe least developed country status by 2020. \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s  support.  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132016  and  its  country \noperations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for the Lao PDR recognize good governance as a key \ndriver of change and make the strengthening of public sector capacity a cross cutting theme \nacross all sectors.11 A 2010 country assistance program evaluation  by  ADB\u2019s Independent \n                                                \n7 The plan awaits formal approval of the government. \n8 ADB. 2012.

", "3 \n \nEvaluation  Department  recognized  the  importance  of  PSM  to  improving  public  sector \ngovernance in the Lao PDR.12 ADB has provided continuing support to address institutional and \ncapacity  weaknesses  in  the  country,  focusing  on  (i)  PFM  subsystems  related  to  budget \nformulation,  medium-term  fiscal  and  expenditure  frameworks,  accounting  and  reporting;  and       \n(ii) external audit by the State Audit Organization (SAO). In addition, the implementation of several \nADB education and health projects has strengthened the capacity for budget planning and \nbudget execution in these sectors.13 The GCDPSMP, including subprogram 2, builds on this \nearlier work. ADB collaborates closely with other development partners in all activities under the \nGCDPSMP. This includes cooperation under the NGPARP coordination framework.14 \n \n7.  Lessons learned. Implementation of the GCDPSMP so far has reconfirmed the long-\nterm nature of governance reforms. They also demand flexibility in implementation to respond to \nchanges in priorities. This need is compounded in the case of the Lao PDR by the country\u2019s \nparticular political and government institutional framework, rising fiscal pressures, and the low \ncapacity in the government agencies at all levels. Given the weak enabling environment and \nlack of efficient managerial structures and capacity for institutions to succeed at an anticipated \npace, it is critical that ADB be continuously engaged and provide technical advice quickly. It is \nequally important that ADB understand the political economy, the overall environment, and the \nformal and informal rules that govern the PSM reform process in the country. Another lesson \nhas been that the public administration and PFM reforms require effective coordination across \nseveral ministries. These lessons have been taken into account in preparing subprogram 2. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact will be an improved delivery of key public services. The benchmark of the \nimpact will be progress toward achieving education and health MDGs. The outcome will be \nstrengthened public sector management at national and subnational levels. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n9.  The GCDPSMP will achieve its outcome by delivering three outputs: (i) implementation \nof multiyear budgeting and intergovernmental fiscal relations; (ii) strengthening of civil service \ncapacity at the central and subnational levels, including gender-responsive capacity; and (iii) \nstrengthening  investment  management  capacity  in  the  public  sector  for  private  sector \ninvestments and identifying potential public\u2013private partnership (PPP) arrangements. Since the \napproval of the GCDPSMP in 2012, the reform momentum has been maintained between \nsubprograms  1  and  2.  Under  subprogram  2,  which  advances  reforms  initiated  under \nsubprogram  1,  the  government  has  accomplished  19  policy  actions\u20149  triggers  and  10 \nmilestones.15 Against their formulation at GCDPSMP approval, several policy actions have been \nupdated and one policy trigger has been added.16 Details are in Appendix 4.17 \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2010.

They are presented \nto show the additional reforms implemented by the government. \n16 There was no reversal or deviation from subprogram 1 reforms, which covered 19 policy actions accomplished \nduring January 2010\u2013July 2012. The Sam Sang initiative has informed the design of relevant subprogram 1 policy ", "4 \n \n10.  Output  1:  Multiyear  budgeting  and  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations \nimplemented.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  has  continued  with  reforms  initiated  during \nsubprogram 1 that target areas found challenging by a 2011 public financial accountability \nassessment.18 Specifically,  under  subprogram  2,  the  government  has  made  progress  on \ndeveloping  an  integrated  public finance  development  strategy for the period  to  2020. The \nstrategy is aimed at linking policy, planning, and budgeting in a consistent framework and \nimproving coordination between the MOF, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI), and \nthe Bank of the Lao PDR. This strategy will be informed by the fiscal strategy paper, the \nmedium-term budget framework being supported by ADB, and an integrated macroeconomic \ncoordination framework developed by the MOF.19 The MOF is also finalizing revisions to the law \non state budget for submission to the National Assembly in December 2014. The revisions will \nseek  to  address  the  most  serious  PFM  weaknesses.20 Central  and  provincial  government \nexpenditures for health and education increased significantly during 2012\u20132014 (footnote 3). In \naddition, the MOF, in partnership with the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and the \nMinistry of Health (MOH), has initiated development of medium-term expenditure framework in \nthe health and education sectors.  \n \n11.  The government also amended its law on accounting in December 2013. The law now \nrequires  all government  entities to comply  with  the  cash-based  International  Public  Sector \nAccounting  Standards  (IPSAS).  The  government  prepared  an  accounting  manual  to  guide \nimplementation of these standards. The scope of the government financial information system \n(GFIS)\u2014the core system for reporting and accounting purposes\u2014has been enhanced by linking \nthe GFIS to the tax and customs information management systems. The MOF has initiated a \nreview on the information technology solution for the Lao financial management information \nsystem that would eventually take over from the GFIS and would cover the budget preparation \nand execution phases. To improve the transparency, equity, predictability, and effectiveness of \ncentral government transfers to provinces and districts, the MOF has undertaken a review and \nadopted a road map for improving intergovernmental fiscal transfer arrangements to accelerate \nimplementation  of  the  Sam  Sang  initiative.21 As  part  of  implementation  of  the  Sam  Sang \ninitiative in the short term, the MOF issued guidelines on revenue collection responsibilities and \nrevenue sharing between the central government and local administrations, since this was not \ncovered in sufficient detail in the budget law. \n \n12.  Since subprogram 1, the SAO has continued making progress on its high priority to build \ncapacity and improve systems in procurement audit. A total of 527 of its auditors, 31% of whom \nwere women, were trained in procurement audit in May 2012\u2013April 2014. SAO developed \n                                                                                                                                                       \nactions. Implementation of Sam Sang initiative\u2019s pilot has provided context to the pace of subprogram 2 reforms \nsuch as intergovernmental fiscal transfers and civil service capacity building. \n17 The formulation of policy actions has been updated to better reflect the status of reforms without affecting the \nsubstance of the policy actions. In some cases, the updated formulations reflect the greater-than-expected reform \nprogress. A new trigger was introduced to reflect the progress in improving the civil service training framework. \nSubsequent discussion on the outputs relates to accomplishments under both policy milestones and triggers. \n18 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n19 Fiscal Strategy for the Lao PDR (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Given the large civil \nservice wage bill increase in FY2013, the MOF considers the medium-term budget framework to be an important \ntool to ensure fiscal sustainability. \n20 Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 2). \n21 The review considers determination of total envelope of transfers to provinces and districts as a defined share of \ncentral government\u2019s revenues; this transfer envelope would then be apportioned to provinces and districts based \non a formula reflecting the area, population, poverty level, and level of economic development of each province and \ndistrict. ", "5 \n \nprocurement audit implementation guidelines and training materials benchmarked against the \nInternational  Standards  of  Supreme  Audit  Institutions  (ISSAI).22 SAO  staff  members  also \nconducted two pilot audits in March\u2013June 2013 and two model audits in January\u2013March 2014.23 \nThis helped validate their professional capacity under actual conditions in real audits. In addition, \ncoordination between the economic planning and finance committee (EPFC) of the National \nAssembly and the SAO has been strengthened by ensuring a detailed examination of SAO\u2019s \naudit reports by the EPFC; introducing\u2014for the first time in Lao PDR\u2014a provision on hearing by \nthe National Assembly on the SAO\u2019s audit report on government expenditures; and entitling the \nSAO to follow up on the resolutions of the National Assembly. The SAO\u2019s involvement in the \nbudget  and  public  investment  plan  approval  process  has  also  been  strengthened.  A \ncomprehensive training program for 500 EPFC staff members and members of the National \nAssembly took place. Among the topics covered was the examination of SAO audit reports (133 \nofficials participated, of which 45 were women, in the training on this topic).  \n \n13.  Output 2: Civil service capacity at the central and subnational levels, including \ngender-responsive  capacity,  strengthened.  Since  subprogram  1,  the  government  has \ncontinued  with  reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  civil  service  capacity  at  the  central  and \nsubnational levels\u2014with distinct emphasis on mainstreaming gender equality. This is in line with \nthe Sam Sang initiative. The NGPARP has continued to serve as an integrated implementation \nand coordination framework for governance projects supported by development partners.24 \nDevelopment of a civil service law is at advanced stage. The law will address such issues as \nscope of coverage, civil service structure, recruitment and promotion frameworks, performance \nand competence management systems, fiscally sustainable salary and benefits frameworks, \nand human resource development systems. It is expected to be submitted to the National \nAssembly in December 2015, after incorporation of findings from the evaluation of the Sam \nSang pilot at the end of 2014.25 The Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) has started developing a \n10-year strategy and a five-year plan on public administration reform, building on the experience \nof implementation of the strategic plan on governance, 2011\u20132020. The government\u2019s national \nleading committee on NGPARP, chaired by the deputy prime minister, has continued to closely \nmonitor public administration reforms, as has the NGPARP board. Both met regularly in 2012\u2013\n2014. Although the government has yet to approve a proposed national strategy for gender \nequality in public administration, some of the concepts it will contain are starting to be applied. \nThe MOHA has facilitated establishment of divisions on the advancement of women in home \naffairs offices at provincial and district levels to ensure mainstreaming of gender equity in public \nadministration at the local level and to support strengthening of the capacity of female civil \nservants in local administrations. \n \n14.  The  Public  Administration  Research  Training  Institute  (PARTI)\u2014a  nonpolitical  civil \nservice capacity-building institution established within the MOHA in 2012 under subprogram 1\u2014\n                                                \n22 Among  the  standards used  for  developing  the  guidelines  and  training materials  were  ISSAI standards  on \ncompliance audit, fundamental precepts of auditing, supreme audit institution independence, code of ethics, audit \nquality control, fundamental auditing principles, and performance auditing. \n23 Two pilot audits were aimed at testing the application of procurement audit on small projects at the Ministry of \nPublic Works and Transport and at MOH. In the pilot audits, the SAO auditors focused on only some selected steps \nin procurement\u2014e.g., bid document preparation, prequalification, and opening of bidding documents. The two \nmodel audits helped test the procurement audit methodology through the entire procurement process of two large-\nscale projects valued at more than $1 million each at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and the MOH. \n24  These  projects  include  (i)  the  UNDP-supported  Strengthening  Capacity  and  Service  Delivery  of  Local \nAdministrations Project, (ii) the UNDP-supported Civil Society Support Program, (iii) the ADB\u2019s GCDPSMP, and (iv) \nthe European Commission\u2019s Legal and Institutional Framework for Public Administration Project. \n25 The draft law also provides for equality among civil servants regardless of age and gender and extends the \nretirement age of women from 55 to 60 to equal that of men. ", "6 \n \nhas  started  providing  public  administration  and  management  training  at  the  central  and \nsubnational levels.26 At least 30% of training participants have been women, in line with the \nprovisions of the draft national strategy for gender equality in public administration. PARTI is still \nunderstaffed and under-resourced and has drafted and submitted for MOHA\u2019s review a 5-year \nstrategic development plan and proposal to gradually increase its staffing and resources.27 \nUnder this plan, the PARTI would aim to have 40% of its employees, 15% of its managers, and \n30% of the overall training participants be women. To provide a framework for civil servant \ndevelopment, the MOHA has begun developing a decree on training and development in the \ncivil service. As the secretariat of the Sam Sang steering committee, the MOHA has continued \nto lead the government effort to strengthen the new administrative architecture at the district \nlevel.  Its  efforts  have  also  included  establishment  of  rules  and  mechanisms  for  village \nadministration,  initiation  of  a  revision  of  administrative  arrangements  to  empower  local \nadministrations, clarifications on salaries of village administration staff, and improvement of \nvillage  administration  capacity.  In  the  Sam  Sang  pilot  districts  covered  by  the  district \ndevelopment  fund  under  the  Strengthening  Capacity  and  Service  Delivery  of  Local \nAdministrations Project funded by the UNDP, the government has ensured that the head of the \ndistrict Lao Women's Union and one woman village representative were members of the district \ndevelopment fund committees to empower women in the decision making at the local level.  \n \n15.  Since subprogram 1, the National Commission for the Advancement of Women (NCAW), \nwhich is a government agency responsible for the implementation of the National Strategy for \nthe Advancement of Women (NSAW), has continued increasing the role of women in public \nadministration  through  subcommittees  on  advancement  of  women  established  in  all  line \nministries and provincial and district administrations. To monitor implementation of the NSAW, \nthe NCAW has developed a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) and reporting \nframework and conducted training in selected line ministries. As part of the implementation of a \nfive-year strategy for the advancement of women in the agriculture and forestry sector, the \nMinistry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has developed a comprehensive framework and \nconducted capacity building to mainstream gender equity into sector planning, budgeting, and \nM&E. \n \n16.  Output 3: Investment management capacity in the public sector for private sector \ninvestments and potential public\u2013private partnership arrangements strengthened. The \ngovernment announced a moratorium in June 2012 during subprogram 1 on granting land \nconcessions and leases for the predominantly foreign private sector initiatives in the mining and \nagricultural sector, especially for rubber and palm oil plantations. Since then, the Ministry of \nNatural Resources and Environment (MONRE) has made headway on developing a national \nland policy and amendments to the country\u2019s land law. Both are in final preparation for the \nNational Assembly\u2019s consideration. The MONRE has also developed revisions to the decree on \ncompensation and resettlement for development projects that aims to improve fairness and the \nscope of compensation in cases of land acquisition and resettlement in the public interest. The \nproposed  revisions  are  undergoing  review  in  the  government.  To  synchronize  land  and \nenvironmental sustainability frameworks, the MONRE has developed a national resources and \nenvironment policy. Land management issues are also being mainstreamed in the revisions to \n                                                \n26 These courses cover such areas as public administration, office management, induction for new recruits, training of \ntrainers, leadership development and planning, and budgeting and financial management for managers not expert \nin finance. Besides incorporating gender content into its courses, PARTI is finalizing dedicated courses on gender \nmainstreaming and gender and human resource management. \n27 PARTI currently has 17 staff members, of whom 6 are women. Under the plan submitted to the MOHA, PARTI \naims to expand its staff to 50 and has plans for a new building. PARTI\u2019s research department has no staff yet. \nPARTI could recruit only one staff member in 2013 and two in 2014. ", "7 \n \nthe Lao PDR\u2019s national investment policy that the MONRE has submitted for review to the MPI \nminister.  Apart  from  improving  its  policy  and  legal  framework  for  land  management,  the \ngovernment  conducted  a  comprehensive  program  to  build  capacity  in  handling  land \nmanagement issues in the MPI, MAF, and MONRE at the central and provincial levels.28 \n \n17.  The government recognizes the potential role of the private sector in the delivery of \npublic services and in helping to fill the country\u2019s large infrastructure gap. Since subprogram 1, it \nhas made substantial progress on developing a policy and legal framework for making PPPs a \nregular modality for the development of  public infrastructure. The MPI has developed and \ndisclosed an initial conceptual framework on the development of PPPs, which sets out a road \nmap for PPP reforms in 2014\u20132016. It has also reached the public consultation phase in the \ndevelopment of a decree on PPPs expected to be submitted for the prime minister\u2019s approval by \nthe end of 2014. The decree will reflect government policy and principles for PPPs, institutional \nset-up (e.g., high-level government committee on PPPs, a nodal PPP office, and a project \ndevelopment facility), project preparation support arrangements; investor selection procedures; \ntreatment of unsolicited proposals; government support mechanisms (e.g., viability gap and \ncontingent liability funding); and mainstreaming of gender responsiveness in PPPs. The MOH \nand the MOES have established PPP committees and have prepared prefeasibility studies for \ntwo pilot PPP projects in the health sector and one in education.29 \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n18.  The government has requested a single tranche loan in various currencies equivalent to     \nSDR10,052,000 from ADB's Special Funds resources to help finance subprogram 2 of the \nGCDPSMP.30 The loan size of subprogram 2 takes in account Lao PDR\u2019s increased fiscal space \nconstraints and financing needs for development expenditure programs.31 The loan will have a \n24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. The amount of the loan has been included in the government's \nexternal borrowing program for FY2015, which will total $290 million. The government will use \nthe funds generated from this policy-based loan to support full implementation of the policy \nactions contained in the policy matrix and to ensure sustainability of the program\u2019s reforms, with \na special focus on public financing for education and health sectors.32  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The implementation period for subprogram 2 is August 2012\u2013September 2014. The \nexecuting agency is the MOF, and it is responsible for the coordination between relevant \ngovernment agencies, maintenance of all program records, communication with ADB on behalf \n                                                \n28 A total of 94 staff members from the central and local governments, including 10 women, were given this training. \n29 The prefeasibility studies also covered gender considerations, such as an assessment of the education and health \nstatus of women, assessment of their access and use of facilities, establishment of gender-disaggregated baseline \ninformation, assessment of employment opportunities for women during the construction and operation phases of \nthe project, and analysis of project impacts on the security and safety of women. \n30 The overall adjustment cost of implementing the reform measures under subprogram 2 is estimated at $23 million. \nSummary Program Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31 The FY2014 deficit is estimated at 4.2% of GDP, which is higher than the planned deficit of 1.5% of GDP. In \nFY2014, realization of revenue collection was about 85%; tax revenue collection fell short of the plan by 2.5% of \nGDP due to weak mining profit tax collection and overly optimistic revenue forecast. Capital expenditure was \nhigher than planned due to arrears payment of about 1.5% of GDP. \n32 Actual expenditure of the MOES increased by 104% in FY2013 from FY2012. Similarly, the actual expenditure of \nthe MOH increased by 193% in FY2013. These increases are substantial when compared with the 37% growth in \ntotal expenditure in FY2013 over FY2012. ", "8 \n \nof the government, and disbursement of loan proceeds. A program steering committee, chaired \nby the vice-minister of finance, oversees program implementation and provides overall guidance. \nThe SAO, EPFC, MOHA, NCAW, MAF, MONRE, and MPI are the implementing agencies. \n \n20.  Disbursement arrangements. The policy-based loan for subprogram 2 will be released \nin a single tranche, following loan effectiveness. The closing date of the loan will be 30 June \n2015. The government will use the local currency counterpart funds generated by the loan \nproceeds mainly to meet program expenditures and associated costs of reform. The proceeds \nof  the  subprogram  2  loan  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB's \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.33 \nBefore withdrawing any funds, the government will open or nominate a deposit account with the \nBank of the Lao PDR to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and \nliquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from \ntime to time). ADB will retain the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the government\u2019s certification for the withdrawal application. \n \n21.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  PSM  reforms  being  initiated  under  the \nGCDPSMP are long-term in nature, and subprograms 1 and 2 represent important milestones in \na PSM reform continuum. To maintain the reform momentum spurred by the GCDPSMP, the \ngovernment  and  ADB  will  continue  partnering  in  the  PSM  area  through  a  post-program \npartnership framework (P3F). The P3F will allow the continuation of the policy dialogue in 2015\u2013\n2016 in such areas as budget reforms that include multiyear budgeting and intergovernmental \nfiscal transfers; public administration reforms, including civil service management and training; \nand improved governance of land management, as well as development of PPPs. It will also \nbuild a platform for the next phase of ADB policy-based support to PSM reforms, which is \nprogrammed for 2016. The P3F directions in each of the PSM reform areas are in Appendix 4.34 \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The  increased  budget  for  the  education  and  health  sectors  will  make  government \nexpenditure more efficient by reallocating its financial resources to development priorities with \nhigher  rates  of socioeconomic returns.  Ongoing  public  administration reforms  that  improve \ninstitutional and legal frameworks, build capacity through training, and organize civil service \nmore efficiently will make government staff more productive in performing their duties and lead \nto more efficient interaction with the public and better delivery of services. In addition, the \ngovernment\u2019s plans for the administrative and fiscal strengthening of district administrations can \nlead to a better assignment of functions between levels of public administration and more \neffective service delivery, given limited budget envelope. Land management reform and the \nPPP framework will have large potential economic spin-offs from increased and better quality \nprivate sector investment. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n23.  Since the GCDPSMP was approved, the government has continued its PFM reforms to \nimprove  public  sector  governance  in  general  and  to  address  key  weaknesses  in  budget \n                                                \n33 ADB. 1998.

These  efforts  have  included \ninstitutional and capacity development measures to mitigate risks arising from a lack of qualified \nand skilled personnel in the MOF, the SAO, and line ministries. A new government decree on \nprocurement, its implementing rules and regulations, procurement manual and standard bidding \ndocuments has improved public procurement practice. Implementation of laws on anticorruption, \nstate  inspection,  complaints,  state  audit,  and  state  accounting  has  helped  strengthen \nanticorruption  measures  and  tackle  patronage  and  corruption  in  the  public  sector.  Good \ngovernance is a major cross cutting theme in the government\u2019s efforts to improve the land \nmanagement systems and develop PPPs.35 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to \ndate) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  The GCDPSMP is a general intervention aimed at improving public service delivery. It is \nexpected to have an indirect positive effect on poverty reduction by improving implementation of \npublic expenditure programs that target poor and vulnerable groups.36 The program is likely to \nhave a positive impact on gender equity by (i) narrowing gender gaps in access to education in \npoor, rural, remote, and ethnic group areas; (ii) reducing maternal mortality through better \nfunding that will improve the access to emergency obstetric care and skilled attendants at birth, \nas well as lower financial barriers to the use of health services; (iii) enhancing the participation \nof women in decision making; and (iv) improving gender awareness and the gender-sensitive \ncapacity of civil servants to support the delivery of public services. Subprogram 2 is categorized \nas effective gender mainstreaming. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n25.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  the  GCDPSMP  is \nclassified  as  category  C  for  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous peoples.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n26.  The government  has  shown  a  continuous  commitment to  improving  governance by \nundertaking several key reforms in PFM, the legal and capacity development framework for the \ncivil service, and public asset and investment management systems. The cumulative benefits \nand impacts of these reforms are expected to outweigh the associated risks and costs. Major \nrisks and mitigating measures are summarized in the table below. A more detailed review of \nrisks is in the risk assessment and risk management plan.37  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisk Description  Mitigating Measures \nGovernance risk: Patronage and  Strengthening of the SAO and the National Assembly has \ncorruption remain a general challenge.  contributed to enhanced oversight of the government agencies \nPublic procurement and public financial  at all levels.
