The \nProject will (i) improve the learning environment by upgrading the \nphysical  infrastructure  in  schools;  and  (ii)  enhancing  teacher \ncapabilities  through  training  of  trainers  and  teachers,  improved \ncurriculum, and instruction materials. \n \nThe  Project  will  have  four  components:  (i)  increasing  equitable \naccess  to  an  improved  learning  environment  especially  for \neducationally disadvantaged groups, ethnic minorities, and girls; (ii) \nan improved and relevant curriculum, improved assessment and \naccessible instructional materials; (iii) an improved and sustainable \nsystem  for  the  education,  development  and  management  of \nteachers; and (iv) improved institutional capacity and management \nfor more efficient and effective delivery of education.  \n   \nRationale  Limited access and low quality of education are key impediments \nto economic and social development of the country. Inequitable \naccess  also  contributes  to  social  tensions.  The  Government \nrecognizes education as a key intervention for poverty reduction. \nImproved access to and quality of secondary education will help \nconsolidate the gains from expansion of basic education, produce \na  skilled  work  force  better  able  to  contribute  to  the  country\u2019s \neconomic development and play a useful and progressive role in \nsociety.  \n   \nObjectives   The Project\u2019s objective is to improve the quality of public secondary \neducation and improve access to education for the underserved \ngroups, particularly girls and children from disadvantaged groups.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $74.8 million equivalent of which \n$9.29 million (12%) is the foreign exchange cost and $65.5 million \nequivalent (88%) the local currency cost.  \n   ", "iii \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nADB  3.24  26.76  30.00  40 \nDanida  6.05  23.95  30.00  40 \n    Joint Financing with ADB  1.97  21.73  23.70   \n    Parallel Financing  4.08  2.22  6.30   \nGovernment  0.00  14.83  14.83  20 \n \n  Total  9.29  65.54  74.83  100 \n       Percentage Share        12%  88%  100%   \nADB = Asian Development Bank, Danida = Danish International Development \n  Assistance. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30 million equivalent \nfrom its Special Funds resources. The term of the loan will be 32 \nyears, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. ADB will finance 40% of the project costs. This covers \n$3.2  million  of  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $26.8  million \nequivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Danish  International \nDevelopment Assistance (Danida) will provide a grant of $30.0 \nmillion (40%) to cofinance the Project with ADB ($23.70 million on \na joint basis to be administered by ADB and $6.30 million on a \nparallel  basis).  The  Government  will  provide  $14.8  million \nequivalent (20%).  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  30 September 2008 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 March 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  To build ownership, a separate project implementation unit (PIU) \nArrangements  will  not  be  set  up.  The  director  general  of  the  Department  of \nEducation  will  serve  as  the  project  director.  Under  the  overall \nsupervision  of  the  Department  of  Education,  the  concerned \neducation agencies such as the National Center for Educational \nDevelopment,  Secondary  Education  Development  Center, \nCurriculum Development Center, and Office of the Controller of \nExamination will be responsible for implementing the activities that \nfall under their respective jurisdiction by integrating the activities \ninto  their  regular  work  program.  This  is  expected  to  lead  to \nstrengthening of institutional capacity as well as greater ownership. \n \nExecuting Agency  Department of Education  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement financed under the Project will be carried out in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  reflecting \nADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  policy  and  mandatory  use  of  the  ADB\u2019s \nstandard bidding documents.  \n   ", "iv \nConsulting Services  A total input of 237 person-months of international consulting and \n759 person-months of domestic consulting is planned. Of this, 48 \nperson-months  of  international  consultant  services  and  346 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultant  services  will  be  funded \njointly  by  ADB  and  Danida,  and  will  be  recruited  according  to \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants.  A  total  of  189  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 413 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices will be funded by Danida on a parallel basis and will be \nrecruited according to Danida\u2019s guidelines. \n \n  These consulting services will support substantial strengthening of \ncapacity and skills at the institutional as well as administrative and \nmanagement levels. \n \nProject Benefits and  The main project benefit will be improved access and quality of \nBeneficiaries  secondary education through (i) an improved learning environment \nin schools, (ii) upgradation of teacher skills and competencies, (iii) \nimproved  curriculum  and  assessment,  and  (iv)  strengthened \ninstitutional  capacity  for  delivery  of  education.  The  direct \nbeneficiaries of the Project will be (i) students currently enrolled in \nsecondary  schools  and  their  successors;  (ii)  the  teachers, \nmanagers, and administrators who will receive training and thus \nupgrade  their  skills;  and  (iii)  staff  of  institutions  responsible  for \ndelivery of education who will benefit from improved skills. The \nultimate  benefit  will  accrue  to  society  through  better-educated \nyouth who will contribute to economic and social development of \nthe country.  \n   \nBenefits to society at large will accrue through human development \nand productivity efficiency through increased numbers of higher \nquality  secondary  students,  and  a  better-qualified  and  more \nproductive  workforce  leading  to  improved  earnings.  Significant \nsocial benefits will be derived from girls\u2019 education such as lower \nfertility, improved health and nutrition status of their families, and \nhigher  education  attainment  of  their  children  leading  to \nintergenerational benefits.  \n ", "v \nRisks and Assumptions  Two major risk factors could have an impact on the Project. The \nfirst stems from the prevailing security situation in the country and \nits possible impact on project activities. Since the Project aims to \ntarget poorer, disadvantaged districts that  are more affected by \ninsurgency, by the time implementation begins the targeting criteria \nmay  need  to  be  revised.  However,  a  key  grievance  of  the \ninsurgents  is  the  poor  quality  of  education  in  public  schools. \nInterventions that aim to improve the quality of public education \nmay not be affected by the disturbances. The situation will need to \nbe assessed more critically before project implementation so that \nsuitable adaptations may be effected in project design.  \n \nThe second risk is to financial sustainability . Although the loan and \ngrant  funds  do  not  support  recurrent  costs  during  project \nimplementation, the Government will have to provide an additional \n$0.5 million annually for secondary education to sustain project \ninputs  after  the  project  closes.  Although,  even  in  the  currently \nprevailing difficult fiscal situation, the Government has maintained \nits  allocation  for  education,  if  the  demands  for  security \nexpenditures continue to grow and the economy continues to suffer \ndue to the disturbances, necessary resources for education may \nbe constrained. However, such constraints are not likely to have \nsignificant  impact  on  project  inputs  such  as  strengthened \ninstitutional  and  management  capacity,  and  improvements  in \ncurriculum, assessment, and teacher capabilities which will have \nsubstantial impact on improving the quality of education  \n \nOther risks such as weak management and institutional capacity \nwill be mitigated by project inputs especially designed to address \nthese weaknesses.  \n   \n ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Kingdom of Nepal for the Secondary Education Support Project (SESP).1 \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Considerable progress in secondary education has been made in the past two decades. \nEnrollments in secondary education increased dramatically by 324% in the lower secondary \ngrades (grades 6\u22128) and by 124% at the secondary level (grades 9\u221210). Despite this, improving \naccess to and the quality and efficiency of secondary education remains a formidable challenge. \nAlthough  the  gross  enrollment  ratio  (GER)2  is  57%  at  the  lower  secondary  level,  the  net \nenrollment ratio (NER)3 is only 31%. At the secondary level, the GER and NER are 39% and \n21%  respectively.  Such  low  levels  of  participation  in  secondary  education  are  a  severe \nconstraint to Nepal\u2019s economic development.  \n \n3.  Within this limited access, there are further disparities by geographic location, as well as \neconomic and social background. Girls are disproportionately disadvantaged in all categories. \nGirls constitute 43% of total primary enrollment, 41% of lower secondary enrollment, and 40% of \nsecondary enrollment. Significant gaps exist between the poor and the nonpoor. According to \nthe Nepal Living Standards Survey (1996), children from the highest income quartile are twice \nas likely to be enrolled in primary schools and 10 times as likely to be enrolled in secondary \nschools than children from the lowest income quartile. Participation rates also vary considerably \nacross the geographic regions with people living in the mountainous belt and the Far Western \nRegion  being  the  most  disadvantaged.  Participation  rates  for  students  belonging  to \ndisadvantaged groups also decline as students move to higher levels of education. This is also \ntrue of students with physical disabilities. Lack of education limits employment opportunities for \nthe poor, constrains productivity, and perpetuates poverty. Lack of access to education is a \nmajor cause of poverty among Nepal\u2019s disadvantaged groups and contributes to social tensions \nin the country.  \n \n4.  The overall quality and efficiency of secondary education is low. Schools have poor \nphysical infrastructure and inadequate learning materials, laboratories, and libraries. Teachers \nare poorly qualified, partially trained or not trained at all, and unmotivated. Limited resources \nhamper the Government\u2019s ability to effect any improvements. Teacher salaries account for \napproximately 95% of the Government\u2019s expenditure on secondary education. Of those that \nenroll in school, less than 29% reach grade 10. In 2000, the average repetition rate was 13% at \nthe lower secondary level and 9% at grade 9. In 2001, the pass rate for the school leaving \ncertificate (SLC) examination at the end of grade 10 was only 32%. The poor quality of public \neducation has led to a proliferation of private schools that are accessed by the economically \nadvantaged sections of society creating another layer of disparity and disadvantage. The poor \nperformance of the education system wastes already scarce resources. The SESP seeks to \nimprove the efficiency and quality of education to make it a more effective tool of national \ndevelopment (Appendix 1). \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Second Secondary Education Project. Manila. \n2   GER refers to the total number of pupils enrolled.  \n3  NER refers to the total number of pupils from the eligible age group. ", "2 \nB.   Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n5.  Analyses of the performance of the education system and identification of problems \nreflect an education system facing many challenges (Appendix 2). Challenges identified in \nvarious official documents of the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and agencies active \nin the education sector include (i) low levels of literacy and educational attainment; (ii) unequal \nparticipation in schooling across income and social groups, and geographic regions; (iii) high \nrepetition and dropout rates; and (iv) low pass rates at the SLC level. A summary of key \nproblems (Appendix 3) in education follows.  \n \n  1.  Access \n \n6.  Unequal  Access.  There  are  distinct  disparities  in  physical  infrastructure,  teaching \nresources, and learning materials for schools across and within regions. The remote hill and \nmountainous areas suffer due to poor accessibility; but within regions, the rural and remote \nareas suffer similar disadvantages. These areas are home to larger proportions of poorer \nsections of the population. Typically these are also areas of educational disadvantage with low \nparticipation rates from among economically and socially disadvantaged children including girls. \nA further divide in access to quality education occurs through the provision of private education, \nthat not only caters to those who can afford to pay but is concentrated in the more accessible \nregions of the country.  \n \n7.  Learning Environment. Poor and inadequate physical facilities in schools, particularly \nin rural and underdeveloped areas have contributed to low achievement levels. Most schools, \nparticularly in rural areas, were established as primary schools. In response to local demand, \nthey evolved into lower secondary and secondary schools. Due to resource constraints, the \ndevelopment of physical infrastructure did not match the expansion. Most school buildings are in \npoor condition, lack sanitation and piped water facilities, and have inadequate laboratory and \nlibrary space. Consequently, school infrastructure is a key concern for government.  \n \n  2.  Quality \n \n8.  Curriculum  and  Assessment.  Poor  linkages  between  revisions  in  curriculum  and \nclassroom teaching and assessment render the revisions ineffective and also severely constrain \nthe quality of education. Besides, curriculum, supporting learning materials and approaches to \nassessment need to be revised and updated to meet the needs of a modernizing economy. At \npresent, these are reviewed over 5-year and 10-year cycles.  Within these cycles, new curricula \nand textbooks have been developed for lower secondary, secondary, and higher secondary \nlevels.  New  approaches  to  assessment  have  been  introduced.  However,  the  national \ndissemination  strategies  have  lacked  consistency.  Head  teachers,  teachers,  and  school \nsupervisors have been oriented in a cascade of workshops, in some cases supported by self-\nlearning handbooks. Apart from grades 9\u221210, where teachers from across the nation were \ninvolved, participation by subject teachers has been limited. Little linkage exists between the \nteacher approaches required by the curriculum and textbooks, and what teachers have learned \nin  preservice  education  courses.  This  has  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  effectiveness  of \nrevisions in curriculum.  \n \n9.  Teacher Quality. The low quality of teaching is another major reason for the poor quality \nof education. Low entry-level qualifications, inadequate or no training, poor motivation, and \ninadequate support and supervision contribute to the malaise of poor teaching quality. Of the \napproximately  24,700  teachers  at  the  lower  secondary  level,  about  9,700  are  completely \nuntrained and 3,000 are partially trained. At the secondary level, of the approximately 19,200 \nteachers, an estimated 4,850 are untrained and 1,350 are partially trained. Not surprisingly, the \npass rate for the SLC administered at the end of grade 10 was a dismal 32% in 2001. Since ", "3 \nteacher salaries consume a large percentage of the budget for education, the issue of teacher \nquality needs to be addressed urgently.  \n \n10.  At the lower secondary level, only 12% teachers are female. At the secondary level, the \nfigure is even more dismal at 7.6%. Approximately 45% of these are concentrated in the \nKathmandu valley. A sample of teachers from four districts classified as containing a high \nproportion of disadvantaged groups showed that only 8.3% of teachers were from these groups. \nThe gross underrepresentation of these groups is a reflection of the inequities all through the \neducation system.  \n \n  3.  Capacity Building \n \n11.  Management and Institutional Capacity. The administrative setup for the planning and \nmanagement of education has been inadequate and also subject to some experimentation over \nthe years. MOES has been overstretched in its administrative, planning, and policy formulation \nfunctions. This was partly addressed during the design of the second Basic Primary Education \nProgram (BPEPII) when the Department of Education (DOE) was created at the national level to \nadminister school education, leaving MOES with responsibility for policy and planning. However, \nDOE has been preoccupied with the administration and management of the expanded needs of \nprimary education. Lower secondary and secondary education have not received proportionate \nattention. Institutions and agencies providing support to school education have also remained \nfragmented by subsector and their capacity for providing quality support has been hampered by \ninadequate  staff  development,  poor  facilities,  and  frequent  movement  of  staff.  These \nweaknesses have resulted in a lack of ownership, weak implementation of policies, inadequate \ncapacity for meeting the demands for management, and teacher training. This in turn has had a \nserious negative impact on the overall quality of education.  \n \n12.  Government Policies. Poverty reduction is the Government\u2019s primary development goal \nas enunciated in the 10th Five-Year Plan, which is currently being formulated.  Improving access \nto and the quality and efficiency of education, with particular emphasis on literacy and women\u2019s \neducation, is a key component of the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy. The draft Policy \nObjectives for Education in the 10th Plan address poverty reduction through several policy \nobjectives that acknowledge the multidimensional nature of poverty. These include (i) increasing \ncommunity participation and mobilization in managing and resourcing school education, (ii) \ndecentralizing education management and monitoring, (iii) introducing cost sharing in secondary \neducation to partially address issue of resource scarcity, (iv) strengthening institutional and \nschool  management  including  regulation  of  private  schools,  (v)  providing  school-based \nmanagement for greater ownership, (vi) providing institutional capacity building, (vii) increasing \nthe use of information communication technology (ICT) in education, (viii) improving access to \neducation  for  girls  and  other  disadvantaged  children,  (ix)  increasing  partnerships  with  civil \nsociety and the private sector, and (x) improving monitoring and evaluation. \n \n13.  Although government policies are becoming more coherent and educational goals are \nbeing defined under a broad policy umbrella, policy reform is hampered by the complexity of \nexisting policy structures; limited financial, institutional, and professional capacity to carry out \nreform; and to some degree, a systemic, institutional, and stakeholder resistance to major \nchange. In the past, policy limitations have had a serious impact on the quality and efficiency of \neducation. While some limitations are recognized, key policy initiatives necessary for making the \neducation system more efficient have been discussed in detail, agreed upon, and are addressed \nby the Project. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy. In its draft education policy, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) articulates its vision for education, as  \u201call children and adults will have equitable access \nto education of sufficient quality to empower them to break the poverty cycle, to improve their \nquality of life, and to participate effectively in national development.\u201d  ADB\u2019s poverty reduction ", "4 \nstrategy also calls for support for provision of basic services, including education, as a key \npoverty reduction measure. The Project supports ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update \nfor  Nepal,  which  emphasizes  support  for  the  Government\u2019s  educational  reforms  and \ndecentralization policies. \n \n15.  ADB\u2019s  strategy4  for  the  education  sector  in  Nepal  has  evolved  to  emphasize \nstrengthening investments made during past projects and to build upon them to move toward \nholistic planning and management for the education sector. Thus, the process begun under the \nADB-financed Primary Education Development Project for creating an infrastructure for teacher \ntraining was supported under the Teacher Education Project5 and will be strengthened and \nconsolidated under the proposed SESP. In other areas such as curriculum and examination \nreform,  school  management,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation,  the  SESP  will  build  upon \ninvestments made under the Secondary Education Development Project (SEDP), and at the \nsame time, move these areas toward greater cohesion and complementarity. The SESP has \nbeen  designed  to  support  ADB\u2019s  strategy  of  taking  a  longer  term  perspective  of  sector \ndevelopment and committing to a series of interventions that focus on high priority goals and \nmeasurable targets within a sector policy framework. ADB assistance to the education sector in \nNepal is also consistent with the Government\u2019s priorities of improving access to and quality of \neducation. The SESP supports the Millennium Development Goals of promoting gender parity in \nsecondary education, poverty eradication, and improved child and maternal health through a \nbetter-educated population.  \n \n16.  External Assistance. External assistance to education has been increasing over the \nyears. The proportion of external assistance in the total education budget increased from 7% in \nFY1992 to 26% in FY1995. In the last two decades, Nepal has received $5.5 billion in external \nassistance for the education sector of which ADB has contributed 11% and the World Bank \n13%.  The  rest  has  come  from  other  agencies  including  Danish  International  Development \nAssistance  (Danida),  Department  for  International  Development,  European  Union,  Finland, \nJapan  International  Cooperation  Agency,  Norwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation, \nSwiss Development Cooperation, United Nations Development Programme, and United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund. \n \n17.  Basic education has received the largest share of this assistance in keeping with the \ngoals of education for all. Currently, there are two related interventions in basic education\uf8e7the \nmultiagency  funded  BPEP  II  and  ADB-funded  Teacher  Education  Project.  In  secondary \neducation, the SEDP closed in June 2000; cofinancing by the Department for International \nDevelopment continued with program support until June 2002. Details of external assistance to \nthe education sector in Nepal and lessons learned are at Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Lessons  Learned.  Valuable  experience  has  been  gained  from  these  interventions.  \nExperience from the BPEP I indicated that it did not accomplish sufficient improvements in the \nlearning and achievements of students. Teacher performance was identified as one of the key \nareas for improving quality. Review of Primary Education Development Project revealed that (i) \npoor classroom teaching practices remain a major deterrent to improving quality; (ii) one-time, \nshort-term training of teachers is inadequate to bring about changes in classroom behavior; (iii) \na  comprehensive,  coordinated,  and  well-articulated  policy  for  teacher  training  needs  to  be \ndeveloped; (iv) sustained, ongoing inputs are needed for building professional, administrative \nand  managerial  capacity  in  the  teacher  training  institutions;  and  (v)  greater  institutional \ncoordination is necessary. Lessons learned from the SEDP include (i) sustained changes in \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995.

", "5 \nschool and classroom practices are possible only through local efforts with continued and \nconsistent  professional  support  from  district  education  office  (DEO)  officials  and  other \nprofessionals; (ii) curriculum reform should proceed with the total school system in view; (iii) \ndependence on a simple institution to print the enormous number of textbooks risks availability \nand quality;  (iv) long-term policy commitment is essential for bringing about radical reform in the \nSLC examination; (v) teacher training needs to be followed up with professional support to bring \nabout changes in classroom teaching-learning practices; (vi) given the crucial role of technical \nassistance (TA) in the smooth operation of the project, ensure that the TA financed by other \nfunding agencies is available to the project on time as per the implementation schedule. The \nmidterm review mission for the BPEP II suggested strategic shifts and synergies in its program. \nIn particular, it suggested a need to (i) take a more holistic view of education in Nepal to seek \nsynergies of primary education with secondary schooling and higher education with reference to \nteacher competencies and the development of lifetime learning skills; (ii) focus on child learning \nand development, and communities' ownership of public schools; and (iii) change the roles of \nDOE, regional education directorates (REDs), and DEOs from implementation to facilitation and \ntechnical support for communities.  \n \n19.  ADB\u2019s own project evaluation reports indicate that (i) ADB\u2019s approach to institutional \ncapacity  requires  a  critical  review  to  address  the  issues  related  to  appropriateness  of \norganizational structures, staffing pattern, and incentive arrangements; (ii) project components \naimed at improving and strengthening crucial educational components, such as curriculum \ndevelopment and staff training, appear to have been underemphasized as far as financial \nprovisions were concerned; and the design of the fellowship input was found to generally not  \noptimal because this component is normally designed during implementation and not when the \nproject is prepared; and (iii) ADB supervision was inadequate in terms of the frequency and \ncomposition of review missions dispatched; the assistance provided in procurement-related \naspects,  planning,  and  implementation  of  fellowship  programs;  and  the  development  of  a \nsatisfactory mechanism for benefit monitoring and evaluation. \n \n20.  The preparation process for the SESP has been guided by the Government\u2019s education \npolicies, in-depth subsector analysis, and the lessons learned from past experience. The SESP \nplaces significant emphasis on (i) policy coherence, (ii) management and institutional capacity \nbuilding, and (iii) the building of synergies between primary and secondary education. It moves \nthe process forward from the first SEDP to a more subsector-wide strategy for educational \ndevelopment. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objectives \n21.  The SESP\u2019s overall sector goal is to expand quality education suitable for the needs of \nnational development. The specific objectives are to (i) improve the quality of public secondary \neducation; (ii) improve access to public secondary education (grades 6\u221210), particularly for girls \nand  students  from  poor  and  disadvantaged  groups  and  districts;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the \neducation system for sustainable management and delivery of education. These objectives will \nbe achieved by (i) enhancing the internal and external efficiency of the secondary education \nsubsector and promoting the relevance of secondary education to national needs; (ii) improving \nthe learning environment in schools including the standards of learning and teaching, and \nexpanding access for girls and students from disadvantaged groups;6 and (iii) developing the \ninstitutional capacity of central and local governments, and local communities for improved \nmanagement and delivery of education.  \n                                                 \n6  An indicative list of disadvantaged groups is at Supplementary Appendix A. ", "6 \n \n22.  The project area includes all 75 districts of the country. The SESP will support all \ndistricts  for  decentralized  planning  and  management.  Project  inputs  for  curriculum  and \nassessment reform, teacher training, and management and institutional capacity building will \nhave positive impact nationwide. The Project supports policy reform7 to improve the efficiency of \nschool education. The Project has a pro-poor focus. Schools in 10 poor districts will be selected \nfor intensive inputs. The districts, as well as schools within the districts, will be selected on the \nbasis  of  criteria  that  will  include  poverty  status,  presence  of  disadvantaged  communities, \nindicators of internal efficiency, remoteness, and a functioning school management committee \n(SMC). Select schools in the remaining 65 districts will receive less support. Assistance will be \nprovided to schools in the form of a block grant based on the school improvement plans (SIPs) \nprepared by the SMCs. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n23.  The SESP will have the three components. \n \n1.  Access: Increased Equitable Access to an Improved Learning Environment \n24.  The aim of this component is to increase equitable access, particularly for educationally \ndisadvantaged groups and girls, by improving the learning environment in schools through \nimproved facilities, provision of residential accommodation for women and girls in remote areas, \nand scholarships for girls and students from disadvantaged groups. The component will be \nsupported through (i) grants for improving facilities in selected poor schools based on the SIPs, \n(ii)  improved  information  gathering  and  monitoring  of  special  needs  students  in  local \ncommunities and their participation in schools, (iii) provision of scholarships to girls and students \nfrom  disadvantaged  groups  including  students  with  disabilities  in  need  of  partial  or  full \nscholarships through SIPs, and (iv) provision of residential facilities for female teachers and \ngirls.  This  component  is  expected  to  increase  enrollment  of  girls  and  students  from \ndisadvantaged groups by (i) improving the learning environment in schools thereby enhancing \nthe perceived value of education, (ii) providing infrastructure for greater representation of female \nteachers and girls, and (iii) targeting support to girls and students from disadvantaged groups. \n \n25.  Due to resource and capacity constraints, assistance will be provided to 150 schools in \n10 selected districts in a phased manner. In selection of districts, priority will be given to areas \nof  acute  disadvantage  after  due  consideration  of  the  security  environment  in  the  districts. \nCriteria for selection of these districts will be developed as a project launch exercise.8 The \nselection of schools within the selected districts will be made in accordance with criteria devised \nduring midterm review of the BPEP II. Schools in the remaining 65 districts will receive a lesser \ndegree of assistance. Criteria will also be developed for (i) selecting schools for providing \nsecure accommodation for women teachers; (ii) expanding hostels for girl students at the \nsecondary level from remote areas complementary to the BPEP II inputs; and (iii) identifying \nbeneficiaries for targeted interventions. The criteria for selection of individual beneficiaries will \nbe devised to ensure transparency through adequate publicity and community participation.  \n \n26.  The component outputs will be (i) expected rise in GER from 55% to 65% at the lower \nsecondary level and from 35% to 55% at the secondary level; (ii) increased participation of girls \nfrom 40% to 50%; (iii) improved physical facilities in 150 schools in 10 selected districts; (iv) \nconstruction of 125 residential units for female teachers; (v) scholarships for 35,000 girls and \n                                                 \n7  A matrix reflecting the impact of the SESP on policy reform is provided as Supplementary Appendix B. \n8  Danida will provide support equivalent to approximately NRs 47.5 million for project launch activities to ensure a \ntimely start to the implementation of the Project. This support will be over and above the support committed under \nthe Project.  ", "7 \nstudents from disadvantaged groups, including students with disabilities, over a 5-year period; \nand  (vi)  information  on  students  with  disabilities  included  in  the  education  management \ninformation system (EMIS)  \n \n2.  Quality \n \na.  An Improved Curriculum, Assessment, and Accessible Instructional \nMaterials \n \n27.  The aim of this component is to improve the quality of education by (i) developing a \ncurriculum  more  relevant  to  the  needs  of  society,  (ii)  by  providing  supporting  instructional \nmaterials, and (iii) by improving the quality and relevance of student assessment through a \ncombination of classroom assessment and examinations.  \n \n28.  The SESP will support this component through interventions at the school, district, \nregional, and national levels.  \n \n29.  At the School Level. Within the national curriculum framework schools will be given \nsome choice to select curricula elements, textbooks, classroom interactions, and cocurricular \nactivities that meet local needs. A system of supporting the curriculum development process will \nbe developed at the local level through recurrent training of teachers and capacity building of \nthe SMCs. Realistic student assessment schemes for use in the classroom will be developed by \nthe school assessment unit in the Curriculum Development Center (CDC). Teachers will be \nsensitized for assessing all children without bias including children from disadvantaged groups, \nethnic minorities, and girls. Training of head teachers and teachers will include competencies \nrelated to curriculum revision, classroom research, and reporting techniques.  \n \n30.  At the District Level. Local curricula forums will be organized with representation from \nparents,  village  development  community  members,  teachers,  community  members,  and \nmembers from ethnic minorities. The district education committee (DEC) will be responsible for \nthe operation of the Grade 8 and SLC examination. An EMIS will be developed to reflect \nsubject-based  allocation  of  teachers;  and  availability  of  curriculum,  textbooks  and  teacher \nguides (the location and responsibility for information collection at the district level will be \ndetermined under the reorganization of the DEO's covered under component 4). Under the \nsupervision  of  the  DEO,  supervisors  and  resource  persons  will  coordinate  collection  of \nquantitative and qualitative monitoring and evaluation data.  \n \n31.  At the Regional Level. The role of the regional CDC curriculum committee will be \nstrengthened for evaluation and monitoring of curriculum- and textbook-related issues. Regional \nexamination offices will be established at the REDs to ensure the quality of the regional grade 8 \nexamination. \n \n32.  At the National Level. The role and responsibilities of the Curriculum Development \nCouncil  will  be  expanded  to  include  assessment,  and  be  reconstituted  as  the  curriculum \ndevelopment and assessment council with responsibility for policy formulation for curriculum \nand assessment. Parallel to this, a national curriculum framework will be developed covering \ngrades 1\u221212. This will include a comprehensive study of the current curriculum at the document \nand classroom instruction levels. CDC will be responsible for the process of continuous review \nand  updating  of  the  national  curriculum,  but  implementation  activities  and  teacher  support \nmaterials including open learning guides will be developed at the national, regional, district, and \nlocal levels as considered appropriate. CDC will develop instructional materials appropriate for \nuse in lower secondary and secondary schools. The representation of CDC in the design of \nteacher  training  curriculum  will  be  strengthened  to  ensure  that  changes  in  curriculum  are \nreflected in the training curriculum. The school assessment unit will be established and be \nresponsible for piloting a program for school-based assessment. The Office of the Controller of ", "8 \nExamination  (OCE)  will  develop  common  procedures  for  the  grade  8  examination  to  be \nconducted by the REDs. For conduct and management of this examination, OCE will develop \ntraining modules for regional officers and assist the REDs to develop training modules to be \nincluded in the curriculum for recurrent training of teachers. A school inspectorate will be \nestablished in MOES to conduct independent inspections of a small sample of schools to \nmonitor quality. Printing facilities will be provided to strengthen capacity for domestic printing of \nquestion papers. \n \n33.  The  outputs  from  this  component  will  include  (i)  a  national  curriculum  framework \ncovering  grades  1\u221212;  (ii)  inclusion  of  ICT  in  the  national  curriculum  framework;  (iii)  a \nfunctioning school assessment unit within the CDC; (iv) inclusion of assessment in textbooks, \nteacher guides, and teacher training materials; and (v) a secure printing press operation, which \nwill build domestic capacity for printing of question papers.  \n \nb.  An  Improved  and  Sustainable  System  for  the  Education, \nDevelopment, and Management of Teachers \n \n34.  The aim of this component is to improve learning outcomes by improving the quality of \nclassroom teaching.  This will be achieved by creating an effective and sustainable system for \nteacher education, improving training quality, and enhancing teacher competencies. \n \n35.  To improve the quality and efficiency of teacher education and to ensure more effective \nteaching in the classroom, the Project will support key activities at four levels. \n \n36.  At the School Level. A school training plan will be an integral part of the SIP exercise. \nEach school will be allocated an annual quota of training days based on the number of teachers \nin the school, the proportion of female teachers, and the school\u2019s ability to set and achieve \ntargets and implementing measures to improve access and equity. The school will select the \nteachers for training. All head teachers will receive management training, which will lead to \nmandatory certification. Through the SIP, 1,300 scholarships will be provided mainly to females \nbut also to a small number of males from disadvantaged groups for in-service teacher training \ncertificate. Monitoring and supervision to assess the impact of training will be the responsibility \nof the SMC as part of overall monitoring within the SIP.  \n \n37.  At the District Level. The capacity of the secondary education development units \n(SEDUs) will be strengthened and 10 new SEDUs will be created. Separate residential facilities \nwill be provided for women at all SEDUs. Teacher training will be provided through the 200 \nresource centers, each to be established for a cluster of 15\u221225 schools, which will be supported \nunder the SESP. This number includes, wherever possible, the resource centers created under \nthe BPEP II, which will be utilized to incorporate a role for lower secondary and secondary \nlevels. Training to master trainers will be provided at the SEDUs by the regional master trainers. \nA management framework will be developed to define the roles of DEOs and SEDUs for training \nresponsibilities. The DEOs will be responsible for monitoring the quality of training at the SEDUs \nin their districts. \n \n38.  At the National Level. The training and instruction committee will be reconstituted as \nthe  national  council  for  teacher  development  (NCTD).  The  NCTD  will  be  responsible  for \nformulating policies and guidelines related to teacher development for the school sector. It will \nalso initiate the development of a set of national teacher competencies and national teacher \ntraining  curriculum  guidelines  to  be  prepared  by  the  National  Institute  for  Education \nDevelopment  (NIED)  in  consultation  with  faculties  of  education,  and  will  include  gender \nsensitization, needs of children with disabilities, an introduction to ICT, and assessment in the \nclassroom. To strengthen in-service teacher training across school education, the institutions \nresponsible for teacher training\uf8e7NCED, Secondary Education Development Center (SEDEC), ", "9 \nand DEC\uf8e7will be merged to form the NIED. At the level of secondary education, the NIED will \ndevelop and pilot a system of recurrent training to be implemented at the resource centers. It \nwill also develop and implement an in-service teacher training certificate to meet the licensing \nrequirements for teachers. The professional capacity of the NIED will be strengthened to enable \nit  to  carry  out  a  wide  range  of  training-related  activities.  NCED\u2019s  management  training \nresponsibilities will be transferred to a new institution, which will be renamed national education \nmanagement center. \n \n39.  The  outputs  from  this  component  will  include  (i)  a  consolidated,  professionally \nstrengthened institutional infrastructure for teacher training at the national, regional, district, and \nlocal levels; (ii) improved teacher training curriculum and supporting materials; (iii) increased \naccess for females and members of disadvantaged groups to teacher training; (iv) improved \nmechanisms for development of policy, strategic planning, and management of teacher training; \n(v)  13,500  teachers  will  receive  in-service  training;  and  (vi)  26,000  teachers  will  receive \nrecurrent  training.  Component  outputs  will  also  include  improved  competencies  of  master \ntrainers and trainers.  \n \n3.  Capacity Building: Improved Institutional Capacity and Management \n \n40.  The  aim  of  this  component  is  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  government  agencies, \ninstitutions,  communities,  and  schools  for  improved,  efficient,  and  effective  planning, \nmanagement, and delivery of education.  \n \n41.  This SESP will support management and institutional capacity building at four levels. \n \n42.  At the School Level. Head teachers will be provided mandatory 1-month training. Head \nteachers will evaluate the performance of the teachers and the performance of the head teacher \nwill, in turn, will be evaluated by the SMC, for which training will be provided. Management \ntraining will be provided for head teachers, SMCs, and village education committees (VECs) \nwith particular emphasis on the preparation of the SIP. This training will provide for greater \nownership  among  communities  of  school  management  and  other  education  delivery \nmechanisms. Training will also be provided to support staff in schools.  \n \n43.  At  the  District  Level.  All  DEO  staff  will  be  provided  training  in  planning  and \nmanagement of education at the district level. A planning officer will be appointed to each DEO \nto support the district planning team and monitoring and assessment functions of the DEO. \nEfforts will be made to ensure greater employment of women in the DEO as well in the training \nof DEO staff. \n \n44.  At the Regional Level. The REDs will be assigned tasks in three areas: planning, \nmonitoring,  evaluation,  and  supervision;  teacher  training  and  teacher  management;  and \ncurriculum, assessment, and examination. The REDs will be provided with additional staff and \nfacilities to undertake these tasks. \n \n45.  At the Central Level.  Subcomponent A. Organization Restructuring and Institution \nBuilding. Within MOES, the Organizational and Personnel Training Section will function as the \nsecretariat for the NCTD. Organizational changes will be effected within DOE for improved \nmanagement of school education.9 NCED, SEDEC, and DEC will be merged to form a single \nNIED. The management training unit within NCED will be given separate status within the NIED, \nwith  the  understanding  that  it  will  eventually  grow  into  an  independent  national  education \nmanagement center. Subcomponent B. Improve the Staffing Systems. Based on the human \nresource  development  (HRD)  plan,  currently  under  preparation,  the  management  training \n                                                 \n9  These will be synchronized with the recommendations made during the midterm review of the BPEP II. ", "10 \ndivision of the NIED will develop a short- and medium-term training plan for education managers \ntaking  into  account  urgent  needs  and  existing  capacity.  Subcomponent  C.  Improve  the \nInformation and Communication System. ICT will be used to enable the digital transfer of \ninformation within and across both regions and institutions. The information and communication \nsystem of MOES will be strengthened. ICT training will be provided, as appropriate, to all \nrelevant personnel of MOES and its allied agencies and institutions involved in the delivery of \neducation. Subcomponent D. Improve the School Supervision and Inspection System. A school \ninspection system will be developed in MOES, and inspection teams will be formed at the \nregional and district levels. \n \n46.  The outputs from this component will include (i) a rational, consolidated institutional \nstructure; (ii) a national council responsible for teacher training policy; (iii) a national institute for \neducation  development;  (iv)  10  new  SEDUs  and  200  resource  centers;  and  (v)  a  5-year \nmanagement and teacher training plan. The component will also result in training of 4,000 head \nteachers, SMCs, and VECs in school management. All secondary schools will have publicly \ndisplayed SIPs.  \n \n47.  Recognizing that strengthening institutional and management capacity is key to long-\nterm self-sufficiency and sustainability, substantial consulting and staff development inputs will   \nbe  provided  under  the  SESP.  Capacity  building  will  focus  on  improving  the  information \nmanagement systems for effective planning and management, as well as inputs for developing \nthe skills and expertise of the personnel of the concerned agencies and institutions in all areas \naffecting delivery of education. The heads of concerned institutions will ensure that the domestic \nand international experts work closely with counterpart staff in the institutions to ensure capacity \nbuilding through skills development. \n \nC.  Special Features \n48.  The  SESP  is  based  on  extensive  consultations  with  stakeholders  and  has  been \nprepared in cooperation with Danida, the cofinancier of this project (Appendix 5). Efforts were \nmade to identify potential external assistance support for secondary education from the very \nstart and work toward a coordinated planning process. The project design followed a two-step \nprocess:  (i)  preparation  of  Secondary  Education  Development  Plan  based  on  enrollment \nprojections over a 10-year period; (ii) a core document that details a framework for support to \nsecondary education in the first phase of 5 years.  \n \n49.  The SESP is designed within the framework of the core document and will support the \nGovernment\u2019s  educational  reform  process.  It  incorporates  some  features  that  are  new  to \nsecondary education in Nepal. Some of these have resulted from past experience in the sector, \nparticularly of the BPEP II. Others are the result of a highly participatory process during which \nissues  of  secondary  education  were  discussed  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders.  These \nfeatures support the Government\u2019s poverty reduction and governance reform strategies and \ninclude five features. \n \n50.  Decentralization. Decentralization is a key plank of the Government\u2019s development \nstrategy. Decentralization mechanisms for the delivery of education will, in the initial phase, be \nmade applicable to the delivery of primary education in five districts on a pilot basis. The \napplication of decentralized mechanisms to secondary education is expected to take a few \nyears. The progress in implementation of decentralization in terms of secondary education will \nbe reviewed during the midterm review of the Project. The review will make a recommendation \nfor changes in modalities for the delivery of secondary education in support of the Government\u2019s \ndecentralization policy as required. However, the SESP will provide capacity building inputs in \nsupport of decentralization to fill gaps in capacity to implement these policies. Meanwhile, lack \nof ownership by communities and weak supervision by government agencies are two major \nreasons for the poor quality of secondary education. The SESP will address these weaknesses ", "11 \nby  strengthening  the  role  of  parents,  communities,  local  elected  bodies,  and  government \ninstitutions in school improvement planning and management. The SESP integrates the process \nfor the development of the SIP for secondary schools with the SIP exercise being undertaken \nunder the BPEP II for primary schools. The SESP provides substantial capacity buildings inputs \nfor decentralized planning and management. The roles and responsibilities of different agencies \nunder current policies are detailed in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n51.  Institutional Restructuring and Capacity Building. Institutional support to education \nhas been weak and fragmented by subsector. The SESP will rationalize the institutional setup \nby restructuring and consolidating for greater efficiency. At the national level, the institutions and \nagencies responsible for teacher training for primary and secondary levels will be merged to \nform a single national institution (NIED). At the regional, district, and local levels, the agencies \ninvolved in teacher training will be strengthened and expanded. DOE will be reorganized for \nmore coordinated administration of school education. Current and proposed structures of MOES \nand DOE are provided in Appendix 6. The capacity of the agencies responsible for delivery of \neducation at all levels will be strengthened through multiple inputs. \n \n52.  Policy. The SESP supports the conversion of the training and instruction committee into \nthe national teacher council to create a single entity for formulating policy for teacher education \nand  training  for  both  primary  and  secondary  education.  A  key  project  outcome  will  be  a \ncomprehensive teacher training policy for the school sector. This will address some of the key \nquestions  that  have  arisen  regarding  teacher  competencies  and  preservice  and  in-service \ntraining. The project inputs in the areas of curriculum, assessment, and school inspection reflect \npioneering policy direction.  \n \n53.  Information  and  Communication  Technology.    The  SESP  introduces  ICT  as  an \nintegral component of management and institutional capacity building. Officials will receive \ntraining in ICT for multiple levels of use as determined by their professional responsibility. ICT \nwill  be  used  to  strengthen  the  administrative,  planning,  and  management  capacity  of  the \ninstitutions and government agencies responsible for the delivery of education.   \n \n54.  Social  Targeting.  Given  the  severe  geographic,  economic,  social,  and  gender \ndisparities in access to education, the SESP will provide block grants of up to $78,000 over a 5-\nyear period to schools in 10 pilot districts that will be selected on the basis of criteria devised to \nidentify areas of maximum disadvantage. Criteria for selection of schools will include presence \nof disadvantaged communities and indicators of low efficiency such as net enrollment and girls\u2019 \nenrollment. Schools in the remaining 65 districts will also be assisted but at a reduced level. \nAccommodation in selected locations will be provided for female teachers. Hostels will be \nprovided for girls attending secondary schools in remote areas. The SESP will initiate special \nmeasures for the recruitment of female teachers and teachers from disadvantaged groups by \nproviding  scholarships  to  teachers  from  these  groups  to  meet  the  in-service  training \nrequirements for licensing. Need-based scholarships will be provided to girls and students from \ndisadvantaged groups including students with disabilities.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n55.  The total cost of the SESP is estimated at $74.8 million equivalent, including physical \nand price contingencies, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $9.29 million equivalent (12%) \ncomprises the foreign exchange cost, and $65.5 million equivalent (88%) comprises the local \ncurrency cost. The Project supports civil works, procurement of vehicles, office equipment, \nconsulting services, training, research, and benefit monitoring and evaluation but excludes \nsalaries of regular project staff, rental of office space, and taxes and duties (Appendix 7).

It is proposed that ADB and Danida cofinance 80% of the proposed project cost due to \n(i) the severe economic constraints that Nepal is facing because of the security environment in \nthe  country;  and  (ii)  the  SESP  is  nonrevenue  generating  and  intended  to  support  public \nsecondary education for improved access for girls and other disadvantaged students, and \ncapacity building for government agencies, institutions, schools, and communities. The SESP \nwill have strong social benefits. It particularly targets gender and social discrimination through \ntargeted interventions, and will have a positive impact on reducing inequities in access to \neducation.  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n58.  Under the overall guidance of MOES, DOE will be the Executing Agency.  The Director \nGeneral of DOE will serve as the project director. To build ownership, a separate project \nimplementation unit will not be set up. Under the overall supervision of DOE, the concerned \neducation  agencies  such  as  NCED,  SEDEC,  CDC,  and  OCE  will  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the activities that fall under their respective jurisdiction by integrating the activities \ninto their regular work program under the overall supervision of DOE. This is expected to lead to \nstrengthened institutional capacity as well as greater ownership. The concerned agencies will \nbe provided support for capacity building to enable them to take on the additional activities. The \nlong-term strategic management of the SESP will be placed with the Program Execution Board \nestablished to oversee BPEP II.  Its membership will be expanded to include a representative \nfrom the Ministry of Local Development. At the initial stages, the board may be required to meet \nseparately to direct the SESP. However, later the board may be more expediently convened to \naddress both the BPEP II and SESP. An interagency project management committee will be \nestablished to monitor the activities of the SESP more closely and ensure coordination of the \nagencies involved with implementing different activities under the SESP.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n59.  The SESP will be implemented over 5 years beginning in 2003 and ending in 2008. The \nGovernment has assured that adequate budgetary support for the SESP will be provided. The \nannual budget allocations will follow the Government\u2019s ongoing annual strategic implementation \nplan. A detailed implementation schedule for the SESP is contained in Appendix 8. ", "14 \n3.  Procurement \n \n60.  All procurement services for the SESP, except for components that are financed by \nDanida on a parallel grant basis, will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. No contracts for \ncivil works are estimated to cost more than $1.0 million equivalent. International competitive \nbidding procedures will, therefore, not be necessary.  Contracts estimated to cost $1.0 million \nequivalent or less will be under local competitive bidding procedures. Civil works packages for \nschool development works and maintenance will be small and may be carried out on a force \naccount basis. The procurement of goods will be grouped into packages larger than $500,000 to \nbe suitable for international competitive bidding procedures. Miscellaneous minor goods that \ncannot be grouped into larger contracts and cost less than $500,000 per contract will be \nprocured  through  international  shopping  procedures.  Minor  items  costing  less  than  the \nequivalent of $100,000 per contract may be purchased directly following proper government \nprocedures to ensure economy, efficiency, and quality. The tentative procurement packages are \nshown in Appendix 9.  \n \n61.  The SESP will have no negative environmental impact. In case of proposed civil works \nunder the SESP all land will be screened for resettlement effects and no site will be selected \nthat would involve land acquisition or land conversion that might generate resettlement effects, \nincluding loss of income, resources, or assets for the nontitled.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n62.  The selection and engagement of all consulting services to be cofinanced under the \nSESP  will  be  in  accordance  with  the  quality  and  cost-based  selection  method  of  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  A  total  input  of  237  person-months  of  international \nconsulting and 759 person-months of domestic consulting is planned. Of this, 189 person-\nmonths of international consulting and 413 person-months of domestic consulting services will \nbe  directly  financed  by  Danida  with  grant  funds.  The  project  funds  together  with  Danida \ncofinancing inputs will support 48 person-months of international consulting and 346 person-\nmonths  of  domestic  consulting  inputs.  Given  the  extensive  capacity  building  needs,  these \nconsulting inputs will cover a wide range of expertise and will result in substantial strengthening \nof capacity and skills at the institutional as well as administrative and management levels. In \naddition to these inputs, Danida will also provide long-term technical support at the national \nlevel for which funding will be in addition to the SESP. \n \n63.  The consulting services are designed to support the SESP, as well as build longer-term \ncapacity of the agencies and institutions responsible for the delivery of secondary education. \nTherefore, the consulting services cover broad areas of expertise that include (i) curriculum and \ninstructional  materials  design,  (ii)  classroom  assessment  and  examination  reform,  (iii) \nmanagement  and  teacher  training  curriculum  and  materials  development,  (iv)  training  of \ntrainers,  (v)  special  needs  curriculum  development,  (vi)  research  and  evaluation,  (vii)  ICT \ncurriculum, (viii) EMIS development, (ix) school planning and improvement, (x) decentralization \nand management; and (xi) operation and management of printing facilities. Indicative terms of \nreference are in Appendix 10. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n64.  DOE  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections  and  requesting \nbudgetary allocations for counterpart funds. It will establish an imprest account for the SESP. \nThe initial amount will be no more than a 6-month projected disbursement or 10% of the loan \namount. The imprest account will be established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with \nADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook. Statement of expenditure procedures may be used to \nreimburse eligible expenditures not exceeding $100,000 per payment and to liquidate advances ", "15 \nmade into the imprest account in accordance with the guidelines. DOE will coordinate the timely \nrelease of funds. This is considered essential because project activities will take place at \ndifferent locations and simple mechanisms are required to disburse small funds quickly through \ndecentralized decision making, while maintaining acceptable levels of financial control. Auditors \nacceptable to ADB will audit the use of the imprest account and statement of expenditure \nprocedures. A separate audit opinion should be included in the annual audit report.  \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n65.  The Government, acting through MOES, will maintain records and accounts adequate to \nidentify goods and services financed out of the proceeds of the loan. DOE will (i) maintain \nseparate accounts for the SESP; (ii) ensure accounts and financial statements are audited \nannually, in accordance with sound accounting principles by auditors acceptable to ADB; and \n(iii) furnish to ADB, not later than 9 months after the close of each fiscal year, certified copies of \naudited accounts and financial statements, and the report of the auditor on these.   \n \n66.  DOE will submit progress reports every 4 months. The reports will be in a format \nacceptable to ADB, and will include (i) progress made against established targets, including \naspects of quality; (ii) delays and problems encountered, and actions taken to resolve issues; \n(iii) compliance with loan covenants; (iv) proposed program of activities to be undertaken during \nthe next 4 months; and (v) expected progress during the succeeding period. Within 3 months of \nphysical completion of the SESP, the Government will prepare and submit to ADB a project \ncompletion report on the execution of the SESP including the costs and compliance with loan \ncovenants.  \n \n67.  The Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud \nand corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Independent auditors will audit project accounts annually.  \n \n68.  Upon receipt of request from MOES for procurement and disbursement under the SESP, \nsuch requests will be shared with Danida before finalization. Modalities for obtaining Danida\u2019s \nno objection will be finalized prior to project implementation. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n69.  In  accordance  with  ADB's  Project  Performance  Management  System  (PPMS) \nHandbook,  a  shortlist  of  verifiable  indicators  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  was  prepared \n(Supplementary  Appendix  D).  This  list  will  be  expanded  and  refined  prior  to  project \nimplementation  as  part  of  the  project  preparatory  exercise  to  be  undertaken  by  Danida. \nHowever, performance monitoring will follow a process approach and project targets will be \namended based on project reviews. PPMS activities will be conducted periodically to gather \ninformation  through  multiple  sources  so  as  to  determine  whether  the  input  deliveries  for \nimplementing program activities have rendered expected benefits to the intended beneficiaries. \nThe PPMS also seeks to detect any deficiency and discrepancy between the plan and the \nexecution of a program in using the resources efficiently so that timely corrections can be can \nbe made to update the project and thus improve the benefits, outcomes, and impact. The PPMS \nwill utilize information from the EMIS, annual and semiannual reviews, midterm reviews, and \nperiodic evaluations and studies.  \n \n8.  Project Review \n70.  In  addition  to  regular  reviews,  the  SESP  will  be  reviewed,  at  midterm,  by  the \nGovernment,  Danida,  and  ADB.  Taking  cognizance  of  the  process  approach  adopted  for \nperformance monitoring, the review will (i) evaluate the project scope, design, implementation ", "16 \narrangements, and institutional processes; (ii) identify changes needed in any (or all) of the \nabove areas; (iii) assess implementation performance against agreed indicators in the project \nframework; and (iv) identify critical issues and constraints, if any. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Project Benefits and Impacts \n71.  Continued  economic  growth  requires  a  well-educated  population  and  workforce. \nInvestment  in  lower  secondary  and  secondary  education,  where  basic  cognitive  skills  are \nacquired  and  consolidated,  is  particularly  valuable  because  it  improves  productivity  and \nincreases basic welfare. Investment in secondary education also improves the quality of, and \nincreases the number of entrants to, higher levels of education, where higher cognitive skills are \nacquired,  with  the  resulting  improvement  of  higher  order  productivity.  Investment  in  lower \nsecondary and secondary education also increases the benefits of other social services (e.g., \neducated women benefit more from health services). In addition, society places an intrinsic \nvalue  on  education,  especially  on  basic  and  secondary  education.  The  implication  is  that \ninvestment in this subsector has potentially high returns, both for the individual and for society.  \n \n72.  In Nepal, at present, the quality of educational achievement is relatively poor, and \ninvestments in improving it can be expected to have significant positive returns. In the long term, \nthe project outcomes are expected to be (i) human development and productivity efficiency \nthrough greater professional qualification of teaching and managerial staff, increased numbers \nof  higher  quality  secondary  students,  and  a  workforce  prepared  for  local  production  and \ncommercial markets; (ii) social benefits derived from girls' education such as lower fertility, \nincreased prenatal care utilization, improved health and nutrition status of their families, and \nhigher educational attainment of their children; and (iii) greater redistribution gains as a result of \nits focus on low income and underserved students.  \n \n73.  The economic benefits of the SESP will be two-fold. First, substantial economic benefits \nare expected to accrue from efficiency gains. The cost of each student repeated year is $29. \nThe SESP will lead to a reduction in repetition rates at the lower secondary and secondary by \n12% and 7% respectively by the end of the project period. Students who do not drop out in a \ngiven year increase their future wage-earning potential. Studies indicate that each extra year of \nschooling  increases  labor  productivity  and  income  earned.  Improved  quality  of  secondary \neducation  will  attract  more  primary  education  completers  to  continue  their  studies,  thus \nincreasing their wage potential. The scholarships provided under the SESP will lead to attracting \ngirls and students from other disadvantaged groups to continue their education at the lower \nsecondary and secondary level. This will have a positive impact on their labor productivity and \nincome levels of their families helping them break out of the cycle of poverty (Appendix 11). \n \n74.  Education is a key means for assisting the poor break the cycle of poverty. The SESP \nhas a pro-poor focus.  About 43% of the total project cost will be provided to improve equitable \naccess by rehabilitating schools and providing scholarships for girls and disadvantaged children. \nNew classrooms will be constructed for students in rural, underserved areas where most of the \nstudents are poor. The SESP\u2019s scholarship program for girls is targeted at rural schools in the \nmost disadvantaged areas. The educational benefits of the SESP will derive from the improved \nquality of education and from the improved efficiency of education services. The SESP is \nexpected to have substantial qualitative benefits, deriving from the introduction of the new \ncurriculum, the development of improved textbooks and other materials, improved training of \nteachers, and licensing of teachers. This focus on quality improvement will in the long run \ncontribute  to  reduced  inequities  among  beneficiaries.  The  SESP  is  expected  to  result  in \nsignificant gains in internal efficiency, by reducing repetition and helping to induce students not \nto drop out. Improved quality, including improved internal efficiency, will also reduce the cost of ", "17 \nsecondary  education,  thereby  freeing  up  resources  to  encourage  school  enrolment  and \nattendance among the poor. \n \n75.  The direct beneficiaries of the Project\u2019s equity, access, and qualitative improvement \nprograms  will  be  the  approximately  1.3  million  current  secondary  students,  and  their \nsuccessors.  Secondary  beneficiaries  will  include  the  approximately  3,100  teacher  trainers; \n4,500 head teachers; 12,500 teachers; 150,000 SMC, district development committee, VDC, \nand VEC members; 200 resource center managers; and 2,700 supervisors, planners, and \neducation administrators who will be the focus of staff development programs.  About 125 \nfemale teachers will be provided with accommodation facilities in the remote and rural areas. \nSecondary education support agencies including SEDEC, CDC, NFEC, OCE, DEC, DOE, and \nNCED, will benefit from capacity building programs. Project support for scholarships for girls \nand students from disadvantaged groups will be weighted directly to poorer regions (Appendix \n12). \n \n76.  The quality of students\u2019 education will be enhanced; the reduced repetition and dropout \nrates imply that individuals will attain higher levels of educational achievement. The net result \nwill be a greater return to the students from their investment in education. Increased access will \nexpand the coverage of education, with greater enrolments, further increasing the number of \nbeneficiaries.  Secondary education graduates of improved quality will also contribute to human \ndevelopment and improved status of women by increasing the number of students qualified for \nhigher  education,  improving  living  standards  and  health,  reducing  population  growth,  and \nproviding people with the means to engage in productive employment.  \n \n77.  The SESP\u2019s civil works enhancements are focused in poor areas selected on the basis \nof  educational  and  economic  disadvantage,  and  therefore,  will  have  a  positive  impact  on \ninterregional equity. Within these regions the focus on civil works needs in ethnic minority and \ndisadvantaged areas will enhance intraregional equity. Although civil works will be undertaken \nfor upgrading physical infrastructure in selected schools, construction activities will be limited to \nthe  existing  school  areas,  and  sound  engineering  practices  will  be  adopted  to  minimize \nenvironmental impact such as noise, air, solid waste, and water pollution at the localized scale \nby the contractors. \n \n78.  To ensure that the Government\u2019s major growth and poverty reduction goals envisaged in \nthe  Tenth  Five-Year  Development  Plan  can  be  achieved,  the  Government  has  adopted  a \nstrategy of channeling limited resources within a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF). \nMOES is one of the five core ministries to have prepared a detailed MTEF with a prioritized \nprogram to serve as a bridge between the annual budgets and the over all Tenth Five-Year \nDevelopment  Plan  targets.  The  Project  provides  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for  a \nprogram approach. Accordingly, the Government has agreed that donor funding will be reflected \nin the MTEF and the national budget for development. MOES has forecast a 10% increase in \nthe regular budget during each year of the project implementation. The regular budget, almost \nall of which is used for salaries and school operating budgets, is the full responsibility of the \nGovernment.  \n \n79.  The  Project  will  have  institutional  benefits  at  all  levels.  The  Project  will  support  a \ndecentralization process, consisting of examination of new roles to be performed at each level \nby district development committee, DEC, village development committee, VEC, and SMCs to \nimprove transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of decision making and planning. This will \nhelp strengthen planning, management, monitoring, and evaluation capacity at the central, \nregional, district, and school levels. At the national and regional levels, the Project will also \nenhance the capacity to reform and strengthen curricula and materials, teacher training and \nevaluation  systems,  and  management  support  networks.  Institutional  strengthening  at  the \nschool level is wide ranging and includes planning and implementation of the SIP, improved \nsupport  for  teachers'  self-improvement,  establishment  of  a  support  mechanism  for  poorer ", "18 \nstudents, strengthened provisions for maintenance of physical facilities, and improved teaching \ncapacities.  The Project\u2019s institutional benefits will also accrue at the national and regional levels \nthrough reorganizing, restructuring, and consolidating institutions providing support to different \nsubsectors  of  school  education  with  the  objective  of  making  them  more  cohesive  and \nresponsible for the needs of the school sector as a whole. Adequate inputs will be provided \nunder the Project for strengthening their administrative and professional capacity to enable them \nto move toward greater self-sufficiency.  \n \nB.  Risks  \n \n80.  Commitment. The Project is designed to help achieve the Government's goals for \nimproving the quality of secondary education by supporting the implementation of educational \nreforms. Key to its success is continued Government and societal commitment.  Given the \nprioritization of education, and the reiterations of the Government\u2019s commitment to expanding \nsecondary education, support for expansion of secondary education as a goal is unlikely to \nwane.  \n \n81.  Stakeholder Participation. The Project has been designed with extensive stakeholder \nparticipation. The activities and actions proposed have been widely discussed and accepted as \nnecessary. There is ownership and commitment at all levels of government and within its allied \nagencies and institutions to the proposals contained in the Project. Despite this, however, there \nare certain risks that are not project-specific but could affect project performance.  \n \n82.  Security  Situation. The  major  risk  arises  from  the  broader  context  of  the  security \nsituation. The Project aims to target the poorer districts for intensive inputs for improving the \nlearning  environment.  Recently  many  poor  and  remote  districts  have  been  affected  by \ninsurgency. The selection of districts will be done after due assessment of the security situation. \nHowever, the security situation may remain volatile. The implications of either a failure to \ncommence  in  selected  districts,  or  the  need  to  pull  out  before  interventions  have  been \ncompleted will need to be assessed. The Project has built in the flexibility to assess the security \nsituation before making geographically targeted interventions. However, since poor quality of \neducation in public schools is an important plank of the insurgency agenda, a program that aims \nto improve the quality of public schools with the active participation of the community and with \nvisible positive impact may not encounter resistance.   \n \n83.  Sustainability.  The  Project  will  generate  continuing  additional  incremental  cost  of \napproximately $0.5 million annually after the project period. This incremental cost will accrue on \naccount of operation and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and salary costs for positions \ncreated for institutional consolidation and strengthening. These costs will be in continuation of \nrecurrent costs the Government will support during project implementation. The Government \nhas committed to continuing budgetary provision for the recurrent costs. Despite the severe \nresource constraints, budgetary support to education is being maintained. A combination of \nincreased resources for security and a decline in revenues could have a negative impact on \nresource allocations for education, as well as on the timely availability of counterpart funds. This \nmay necessitate a review of project design and changes where necessary without a major \nimpact  on  broad  project  objectives.  However,  some  project  gains,  particularly  those  that \nstrengthen capacity; improve the curriculum, classroom assessment, and examination; and \nimprove teacher competencies, will have long-term beneficial impact and are not susceptible to \nshort-term resource constraints.  \n \n84.  Continuity of Pesonnel. Frequent changes of senior civil servants could affect the \noverall direction and continuity of the Project. Of late, trends in continuity of personnel both at \nthe ministry level and related agencies have been positive. Success of the capacity building \ninputs will, however, depend upon institutional leadership and continuity of personnel. The \nProject will continue to emphasize this aspect with Government from time to time.  ", "19 \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n85.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Districts for intensive project inputs will be selected in accordance with criteria \nto be developed under the Danida funded interim project and approved by \nMOES. \n(ii)  Within  3  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  MOES  will  establish  a  school \ninspectorate with a mandate to monitor educational quality, and 8 positions \nwill  be  approved.  To  the  extent  possible,  two  positions  will  be  given  to \nwomen. \n(iii)  Within 3 months of loan effectiveness, criteria will be developed for eligibility \nfor (a) student scholarships, (b) scholarships for in-service teacher training, \nand (c) scholarships for out-of-country training. The criteria for each category \nwill  prioritize  scholarships  for  female  candidates  and  candidates  from \ndisadvantaged groups, including those with disabilities. Among these, equally \nqualified women will be given first priority. The criteria will be subject to prior \napproval by ADB and Danida. DOE will ensure wide distribution of application \nforms for the scholarships, including the eligibility criteria, among the target \ngroups. \n(iv)  DOE will ensure that the SMCs, or in their absence the VECs, will identify the \nfirst group of scholarship students within but not later than 2 months before \nthe  commencement  of  the  school  year  following  the  development  of  the \ncriteria. \n(v)  Within  6  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  CDC  will  establish  a  school \nassessment  unit  with  a  mandate  to  develop  schemes  for  classroom \nassessments  for  students.  These  schemes  will  be  developed  within  18 \nmonths of loan effectiveness. \n(vi)  CDC will be involved in the development of teacher training modules through \ncurriculum  reviews  and  representation  on  curriculum  development \ncommittees wherever necessary. \n(vii)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, MOES will merge NCED, SEDEC, and \nDEC  into  the  NIED  to  serve  as  the  apex  organization  for  teacher \ndevelopment for the entire school sector. The management training division \nof NCED will become a separate unit until its eventual evolvement into an \nindependent national education management center. \n(viii)  Prior to the reorganization of the educational institutions, a staffing need \nassessment  will  be  prepared  for  that  institution,  including  a  plan  for \nredeployment of staff as appropriate. \n(ix)  DOE will be reorganized as per the recommendations of the midterm review \nof BPEP II, and a school division will be established covering both primary \nand secondary education. \n(x)  Within 1 year of loan effectiveness, training for head teachers will be made \nmandatory. The selection process of head teachers will include affirmative \naction for equally qualified women. \n(xi)  Within 2 years of loan effectiveness, NIED will develop a curriculum for 10-\nmonth preservice professional training for teachers for lower secondary and \nsecondary education. For in-service teachers, an equivalent training will be \nmandated for licensing. The content as well as delivery modalities, including ", "20 \ncredits for the number of years\u2019 experience, will be developed within 2 years \nof loan effectiveness. \n(xii)  The  Government  will  take  appropriate  measures  to  staff  the  following \npositions either through redeployment or new recruitment: (a) 75 staff for the \nSEDUs; (b) 75 district planning officers; (c) 5 staff for CDC; (d) 2 staff for \nOCE; (e) 4 staff for the REDs; (f) 2 staff for NIED; and (g) 2 staff for DEC. In \ncase of new recruitment, priority will be given to equally qualified women. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n86.  The following conditions will be met before the loan becomes effective: \n \n(i)  The Government will have amended the Education Rules to reflect the following: \n(i) the upgrading of the Training and Instruction Committee to the NCTD with an \nexpansion of its mandate to cover the entire the school sector; and (ii) the \nreconstitution  of  the  Curriculum  Development  Council  as  the  Curriculum \nDevelopment  and  Assessment  Council  with  an  expansion  of  its  mandate  to \ninclude policy formulation for curriculum development and assessment. \n(ii)  The governments of Nepal and Denmark will have entered into an agreement \nrelating to a grant contribution to the Project under a cofinancing scheme with \nADB. \n \n87.  Arrangements satisfactory to ADB and Danida for administration of the Danida grant by \nADB will have been concluded between Danida and ADB. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n88.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve for the Secondary Education Support Project  \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 22,685,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Nepal from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest \ncharge at the rate of 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and  \n \n(ii)  the  administration  by  ADB  of  a  grant  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \n$23,700,000 to the Kingdom of Nepal to be provided by the Government of \nDenmark. \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n29 August 2002 \n ", "    Appendix 1  21 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance   Monitoring  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nSector Goal       \n       \nTo expand quality  \u2022 Improved quality and access  \u2022 Ministry of  \u2022 Education continues to be a \neducation suitable for the  Education and  Government priority \nindicators by 2007 \nneed of national  Sports (MOES) \ndevelopment  annual data \n  \u2022 Education \nmanagement \nand information \nsystem (EMIS) \ndata \n\u2022 Secondary \nEducation \nSupport Project \n(SESP) \nindicators \nPurpose        \n       \n1.

Despite  the  substantial  increases  in  enrolments,  the  overall  quality  of  secondary \neducation in Nepal remains poor. The key issues that impact quality of secondary education are \nas follows: \n \nA.  The School Curriculum \n \n2.  The curriculum has been criticized for an academic emphases; no provision for local and \nregional flexibility; domination by the school leaving certificate (SLC) examination; and as a \nconsequence  the  students  have  to  resort  to  rote  learning;  few  opportunities  for  practical \nactivities and not related to the labor market. \n \n3.  Curriculum reform was a major focal point of the Secondary Education Development \nProject (SEDP). The overall structure of the curriculum was left untouched by SEDP, as the \nproject focused exclusively on revising the curriculum of existing subjects. Evaluations suggest \nthat the SEDP was highly influential in developing and implementing a less overloaded, more \nstudent centered, and more activity-oriented curriculum for grades 9 and 10. The textbooks for \nthese grades are of a higher technical and educational quality than those for the previous \ncurriculum. This points to the need to undertake a fairly comprehensive revision of the lower \nsecondary curriculum. \n \n4.  The role of vocational education at the school level has been extensively debated and \nthere  is  consensus  that  the  technological  advancement  and  globalization  of  the  economy \ndemands that education be life-skill oriented to enable students to make a meaningful economic \ncontribution. Community and political support for a more relevant job-orientated curriculum is \nstrong. Demand for computer education in public school is growing.  \n \nB.  Examinations \n \n5.  Classroom assessment of student learning is embryonic in Nepal. There is a district level \nexamination at the end of lower secondary school (grade 8). Much more important than the \ngrade 8 examination, is the SLC at grade 10. This examination, with its heavy emphasis on rote \nlearning,  has  considerable  negative  influence  on  the  teaching-learning  processes.  An \nexamination pass is connected to future public and private career possibilities and to social \nprestige. \n \n6.  The SEDP evaluation report suggests that the capacity to ensure increased validity and \nreliability in assessment has increased in the Office of the Controller of Examination (OCE), \nalthough not sufficiently. Pass rates at the SLC have been improving over the last decade and \nin 1999 close to 50% of the regular candidates passed. However pass rates vary considerably \nevery year, as the criterion in each subject is to obtain 32% of the marks and it has proved \ndifficult to ensure that examination papers are of the same level of difficulty every year. The first \nSLC examination according to the new curriculum took place in 2001, and created further \nproblems. First, it took about one more month to publish the results; second the pass rate \ndropped to 31.6%; and third, there was dissatisfaction with the parallel sets of questions, due to \nstriking differences in the level of difficulty. It follows that more work needs to be done on the \nSLC. \n \nC.  Teacher Development \n \n7.  At  lower  secondary  level,  trainee  teachers  are  supposed  to  complete  12  years  of \neducation, 10 years of which is purely academic and 2 years of which is a mixture of academic \nand pedagogical training. The majority of lower secondary teachers spend these 2 years at one ", "26  Appendix 2 \nof the campuses of Tribhuvan University where they reach proficiency certificate level (PCL). \nMost  trained  teachers  in  the  secondary  sector  receive  their  initial  training  at  Tribhuvan \nUniversity.  To become qualified secondary teachers trainees can either take a 3-year Bachelor \nof Education or a 3-year Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science, followed by a one year \nBachelor  of  Education.  The  majority  of  teachers  currently  entering  the  system  have  no \nprofessional training.  In 1999 24,696 teachers were teaching at the lower secondary level \n(16,645 untrained), and 19,185 teaching at the secondary level (9,477 untrained). At the higher \nsecondary level, most teachers are temporary and/or part-time. \n \n8.  Serious challenges relate to the education of lower secondary and secondary teachers. \nAlthough the majority of the teachers (95%) for these levels are academically qualified for their \njobs, many lack qualifications in one or more of the subjects they teach. Further, two thirds of \nthe lower secondary teachers and one half of the secondary teachers do not have the required \ntraining. In spite of official attempts to enroll more women in the teaching force, the proportion of \nfemales for the lower secondary and secondary levels remains around 10%. \n \n9.  Preservice training is the responsibility of the Faculty of Education (FOE). FOE is often \ncriticized  for  its  low  academic  standard,  so  much  so  that  even  if  trained  candidates  are \navailable, schools are reported to prefer teachers who have earned their degrees in other fields \nthan in education. There are two main reasons for this. First, some of the campuses are very \nsmall and have few physical and human resources to provide high-quality teacher education. \nSecond, the FOE courses are not primarily teacher education courses, but rather academic \ncourses in education that focus only to a limited extent on the professional competencies of the \nprospective teachers, in spite of the fact that about 50% of the graduates go into teaching. The \nFOE-courses do not reflect the emphases of the secondary school curriculum. \n \n10.  In-service training courses take place at the 25 secondary education development units \n(SEDUs). Presently the SEDUs train about 5,000 teachers a year. In general they provide 6\u22127 \nmonths of training a year. The number of trainees in SEDUs has fallen over the past 4 years, a \ndevelopment which may reflect the difficult financial situation of the SEDUs. The SEDUs are \nstrongly  dependent  on  development  assistance  and  cannot  become  financially  sustainable \nwithout such input in the foreseeable future. \n \n11.  The problems faced by the SEDUs include (i) small size, inadequately equipped, and \nlimited resources for maintenance and replacement of materials; (ii) understaffed, with only two \npermanent  posts  of  the  chief  and  an  assistant;  (iii)  reliance  on  external  trainers  who  are \nsecondary  teachers  from  nearby  schools;  (iv)  trainers  and  trainees  are  selected  often  for \npolitical reasons, which leads to a lack of commitment; and (vi) the training is not sufficient for \nthe teachers to become formally trained and there is little incentive for them to participate. \n \nD.  Management and Organizational Structures \n \n12.  The educational management structure is the result of government efforts over the past \nfive decades to establish a sound management system for the national education system. The \nprincipal tasks of the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) are planning, policymaking, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. Currently too many institutions report directly to MOES and this \nresults in too little time being spent on policymaking and planning tasks.  \n \n13.  The  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  is  responsible  for  administration  of  school \neducation.  The five regional education directors and 75 DEOs report directly to the director \ngeneral of DOE.  The present structure of DOE appears to have a visible bias in favor of primary \neducation and educational administration. The regional education directorates (REDs) created \nto decentralize school management are shrinking in terms of their responsibilities and authority. \nThey need to be strengthened within identified parameters.  The education offices in each of the ", "                    Appendix 2  27 \n75 districts are headed by DEOs which are supervised by the REDs. The DEO also reports to \nthe chief district officer and to the chair of the district development committee while playing a \npivotal role as a member secretary of the district education committee. Head teachers operate \nunder the supervision of the DEO. Each school has a school management committee (SMC) \nwith a supervisory responsibility. The SMC keeps the schools closer to the community that it \nserves. Current intent and practice regarding supervision do not match, for, in effect, schools \nand head teachers are largely unsupervised.   \n \n14.  Human resource development programs have been offered for almost five decades to \nimprove professional skills of the staff of government agencies and institutions. These have \nbeen project-funded, have emphasized short-term training related to project targets, and have \nplayed  a  critical  role  in  achieving  targets.  During  the  past  few  years,  some  middle  level \nexecutives  have  been  provided  with  masters  and  doctorate  training  in  Denmark,  and \nscholarships at Kathmandu University and Tribhuvan University for higher degree programs. A \nnew draft human resource plan developed by MOES will be implemented through the National \nCenter for Educational Development. \n \n15.  A review of the status of the major computer-based information systems operational \nwithin the education system raises development issues that need to be considered within the \ncontext of institutional information and communication technology policy. Systems included in \nthe review include the DOE web-site, the education management and information system (of \nannual school statistics), school mapping and district planning, school physical improvement \nplanning, secondary teacher information system, the Kitabkhana (school teacher records), and \nthe  SLC  and  higher  secondary  examination  processing  system.    No  systematic  collection \nmechanisms are in place for university, nonformal, and teacher training education statistics. \nCritical  problems  that  emerge  from  the  review  are  the  inadequate  data  flows  and  use  of \ninformation that does exist. Tackling these issues requires institutional changes that put a much \nhigher emphasis on the value of information and access to it. \n \nE.  Summary: Major Issues \n \n16.  Analyses of the education system indicate that it faces serious challenges. Challenges \nidentified include low levels of educational attainment, unequal participation in schooling across \nincome and social groups, high repetition and dropout rates throughout the system, and a \ngenerally low quality of education that does not serve the labor market well.   \n \n17.  Further challenges include a teaching force that is poorly managed, poorly trained, or not \ntrained at all, often teaching subjects for which they are not qualified; an overloaded curriculum \nand weak assessment system; weak management and institutional capacity; inadequate public \nresources for education that are inappropriately distributed; and a system of financial allocation \nthat encourages neither efficiency nor generation of additional resources. \n \n18.  Another issue of concern at the secondary level is whether it should include grades \n6\u221210, 6\u221212, or 9\u221212. The problem of the schooling system is not in the lower grades but at the \nterminal end where more uniformity is necessary. The debate is one that can only take place \nwithin a sector framework. Access, equity, and relevance are at the core of the debate on the \nfuture structure of the sector that needs to be addressed in a whole sector, rather than a \nsubsector, perspective.

Investment in lower secondary and secondary \neducation, where basic cognitive skills are acquired and consolidated, is particularly valuable because it \nimproves basic productivity as well as increases basic welfare. Investment in secondary education also \nimproves the quality of, and increases the number of entrants to, higher levels of education, where higher \ncognitive skills are acquired, with the resulting improvement of higher order productivity. Significant social \nbenefits are derived from girls\u2019 education such as lower fertility, improved health and nutrition status of \ntheir families, and higher education attainment of their children leading to intergenerational benefits. The \nimplication is that investment in this education subsector potentially has high returns, both for the \nindividual and for society.  \n \n \n \nB.

Despite considerable progress made in education in Nepal over the last two decades, \nthe gross enrolment ratio (GER) at the lower secondary and secondary school level is 55% and \n35%  respectively.  Girls  constitute  only  41%  with  considerable  variation  in  participation  by \ngender, as well as by social and income group, across the regions and ecological zones. The \nquality of education also varies substantially. Approximately two thirds of lower secondary \nteachers and one half of secondary teachers are untrained, and most teachers at the higher \nsecondary level are only employed on a part-time or temporary basis. \n \n2.  In Nepal as elsewhere, correlation between educational development and reduction in \nthe incidence of poverty, improvement in labor productivity, economic growth, and the quality of \nlife is strong. Relevant curriculum, improved pedagogical skills and teachers\u2019 competencies, and \nstrengthened management of secondary education will all serve to enhance the quality of \neducation and cost-effectiveness of public and household spending on secondary schooling. \nWith improved quality, parents will be more inclined to send their children to school, and \nstudents will be increasingly motivated to stay in school and complete their secondary school \neducation. Student dropouts and repetitions will decrease, and more students will successfully \ncomplete grades on a year-to-year basis and finalize their grade 8 and school leaving certificate \n(SLC)  certificates.  In  supporting  the  development  of  a  better-educated  work  force  and \npopulation,  the  Project  in  turn  supports  the  acceleration  of  Nepal\u2019s  transition  to  a  more \ntechnologically advanced agriculture and industrial-based economy and the strengthening of its \neconomic development.  \n \nA.  Economic Benefits of the Project \n \n3.  The Project is designed to improve access and equity of access, and the quality and \nefficiency  of  secondary  education  in  Nepal  under  four  project  components:  Component  1: \nIncreased Equitable Access to an Improved Learning Environment; Component 2: Improved \nand Relevant Curriculum; Component 3: Improved and Sustainable System for the Education, \nDevelopment, and Management of Teachers; and Component 4: Improved Institutional Capacity \nand Management.  \n \n4.  The  Project\u2019s  design  focus  on  quality  improvements  will  establish  the  necessary \nfoundation  for  a  more  efficient  secondary  education  system.  Key  improvements  that  will \ncontribute to the establishment of relevant, better quality education include the development of a \ncurriculum that appropriately addresses the employment and economic needs of the country, \nthe development of a new teacher education system and student assessment system, and an \nemphasis on improving teacher capacities. Enhanced quality will also improve retention and \npromotion rates. For each year repetition can be averted, government education expenditure \nand household expenditure can be reduced by an estimated $28 and $18 (at 2000 prices) \nrespectively per student year reduced. For each dropout averted, an increase in the overall \nfinancial and economic returns of the investment will be realized as a result of the graduate\u2019s \nimproved wage potential and positive economic and social externalities gained from increased \neducation.  \n \n5.  The  economic  assessment  is  focused  on  reviewing  the  impact  of  targeted  project \ninterventions and provides an indicative estimate of first round economic effects based on data \nprovided by the Ministry of Education and Sports (MOES) and the findings of a number of recent \nstudies in Nepal. The estimated economic benefits of the Project are increased access and \nequity of access to lower secondary and secondary education; increased general enrollment as \na result of improved quality and effectiveness of public secondary education delivery; and ", "Appendix 12  55 \nincreased efficiency of public secondary education in terms of reduced dropout rates, reduced \nrepeat rates, and increased completion rates. Economic benefits are estimated in accordance \nwith the following assumptions: \n \n(i)  Improved  access  and  equity  of  access  to  lower  secondary  and  secondary \nschools is achieved for educationally disadvantaged groups, particularly girls and \nethnic  minorities  through  a  targeted  scholarship  program  and  improved \nsensitization of teachers and curriculum to their specific needs. \n(ii)  Defined GER project targets for lower secondary and secondary schools of 65% \nand 55% are respectively achieved by the end of the Project in 2007. \n(iii)  Repetition rates for lower secondary and secondary schools are reduced by 12% \nand 7% respectively by the end of the Project in 2007. \n(iv)  Dropout rates for lower secondary and secondary schools are reduced by 12% \nand 14% respectively by the end of the Project in 2007. \n(v)  Private  rates  of  return  for  wage  earners  increases  for  each  year  of  lower \nsecondary  and  secondary  school  completed  by  8.5%  and  10%  respectively, \nadjusted for real growth in wage rates equal to 4% annually. \n \n6.  The estimated direct costs of the Project comprise the project investment, the public and \nprivate cost of providing each addition pupil-year, and the opportunity cost of retaining each \nstudent  in  school  an  additional  year.  Public  costs  are  estimated  equal  to  government \nexpenditure per pupil attending public secondary schools, that is, $28, and private costs are \nthose  incurred  by  the  families  of  each  pupil  on  school  fees,  books  and  school  supplies, \ntransportation, etc., estimated at $18. The opportunity cost of retaining each student in school \nfor an additional year is estimated at $462, that is, equal to the basic wage rate assuming \ncompletion  of  primary  school  and  adjusted  for  real  growth  in  the  wage  rate  equal  to  2% \nannually.  \n \n7.  Based on the assumptions stated the project yields an economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 14%. The real rate of return is likely to be quite a bit higher reflecting positive \nexternalities and long-term intergenerational social benefits that are generated by education, \nsuch as fertility rates and improved health outcomes that are difficult to assign monetary values \nto.

Fiscal Impact \n \n8.  The recent global recession and the intensification of internal security issues have both \nhad  effects  on  Nepal\u2019s  economic  growth  and  impacted  Nepal\u2019s  capacity  to  pursue  it \ndevelopment and poverty reduction agenda. As a result of these events, and in light of it\u2019s \neroding  fiscal  situation,  Nepal\u2019s  development  paradigm  and  fiscal  priorities  have  changed \nsignificantly. Ensuring internal security is considered a priority without which development and \neconomic progress will be limited.  \n ", "Appendix 12  57 \n9.  The strategy of the Government is to \u201charness and channel limited resources within a \nmedium-term  framework  in  order  to  ensure  that  the  major  growth  and  poverty  reduction \noutcomes envisaged in the Tenth Plan [can] be achieved.\u201d1 In support of this strategy, MOES \nand each of the other five-core line ministries, have prepared sectoral medium-term expenditure \nframeworks (MTEFs), which detail actionable prioritized programs to serve as a bridge between \nannual budgets and the Tenth Plan.   \n \n10.  Under MOES\u2019s MTEF the estimated 2001/02 budget for the SESP is $38.1 million, of \nwhich $37.4 million is for the regular budget (an estimated 76% of which is allocated for \nteachers salaries) and $0.7 million is for the development budget (comprised solely of foreign \ngrant). For the regular budget (recurring costs) this reflects an almost 15% increase over the \nrevised budget for FY2000/01, which in turn reflects an increase of over 40% over the actual \nbudget  for  FY1999/2000.  In  contrast,  the  development  budget,  i.e.,  in  terms  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s self-generated resources, has fallen from $0.1 million in FY1999/2000 to no \nbudget allocation for both FY2000/01 and 2001/02. For those fiscal years, the development \nbudget was comprised entirely of a foreign loan of $1.1 million in FY1999/2000 and foreign \ngrants of $0.7 million for each of FY2000/01 and FY2001/02.  \n \n11.  The  Project  provides  a  comprehensive  policy  framework  for  a  program  approach. \nAccordingly, external assistance funding will be reflected in the MTEF and the national budget \nfor development. The MTEF forecast, amended for the Project, is presented in Table A11.2. \nUnder the MTEF, MOES has forecast a 10% annual increase in the Project\u2019s regular budget for \neach year presented, i.e., FY2002/03 to FY2006/07.  \n \nTable A11.2: Budget for the Secondary Education Support Project  \n($ Million) \n                   \n   Actual  Rev.

The development budget, entirely comprised of the Project, is presented by source\uf8e7the \nGovernment portion represents Government counterpart financing, external grants represent \nDanish  International  Development  Assistance  (Danida)  grant  financing,  and  foreign  loans \nrepresent ADB loan financing. Amounts include contingencies, interest, and taxes. The total \nincremental development budget for the Project is estimated at $74.8 million, all of which is to \nbe allocated for under the MTEF. Of the $74.8 million, $14.8 million or 20% is to be provided by \nthe Government, $30 million or 40% as grant financing by Danida, and $30 million or 40% as \nloan financing by ADB.

The overall resource time frame for each year of the Project will be determined through \nthe MTEF process.  This will be guided by the agreements made between the Government and \nthe partners concerning the level of counterpart funding for the Project and the prioritization of \nany  additional  funding  to  the  Project  as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  fiscal  situation  and/or \nadditional funds made available by other partners.
