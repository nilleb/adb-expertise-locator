During  the  2006  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help the Yancheng \nmunicipal government (YMG) of Jiangsu province to prepare the Jiangsu Yancheng Wetlands \nProtection Project. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will design a project to \nmeet the PRC\u2019s goals of conserving natural ecosystems and addressing ADB\u2019s overarching \ngoals of poverty reduction and environmental sustainability.  \n \n2.  At the request of the Government, ADB fielded a fact-finding mission in October 2007. \nThe mission held discussions with representatives of the central, provincial (Jiangsu), and \nmunicipal  (Yancheng)  governments.  An  understanding  was  reached  on  the  PPTA  impact, \noutcome, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, and consultant\u2019s terms of reference. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Jiangsu  province  lies  in  the  east  of  the  PRC  facing  the  Yellow  Sea  with  a  1,040 \nkilometers coastline. The total wetland area within the province, one of the largest coastal \nwetlands in Asia, is about 4 million hectares (ha) or 39% of the total area of the province. It \nincludes 1.74 million ha of natural wetlands and 2.26 million ha of artificial wetlands.  \n \n4.  With  an  area  of  1.5  million  ha,  Yancheng  municipality,  in  northern  Jiangsu,  is  the \nprovince\u2019s second largest municipality (even larger than Nanjing, the provincial capital). It has a \npopulation of 8.1 million and is relatively underdeveloped. Three of its nine counties are ranked \nas provincial poverty counties.2 \n \n5.  About 70% of Jiangsu\u2019s coastal wetlands are located in Yancheng. The 453,000 ha, \nstretch for about 580 kilometers along the coast and cover about 30% of the municipality, \ncomprising intertidal mudflats, creeks, salt marshes, and reed beds. Yancheng wetlands are \nlocated in the Huanghuai Delta, one of the four largest deltas in the PRC. It borders the Yellow \nSea in the east, and its upstream Hongzehu lake catchment is downstream of the Huai river \nbasin.  \n \n6.  From  a  biodiversity  perspective,  the  two  most  important  areas  are  the  Yancheng \nNational Nature Reserve for Rare Birds (YNNRB) and Dafeng Milu (David\u2019s Deer) National \nNature Reserve (DMNNR). In recognition of the uniqueness of these wetland ecosystems and \nthe species biodiversity that they harbor, the two reserves are listed in the Ramsar Convention \nand the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization\u2019s World Network of \nBiosphere Reserves. The YNNRB is very rich in biodiversity, containing 480 plant, 370 bird, 281 \nfish,  48  mammal,  and  45  amphibian  species.  Twelve  animal  species  are  included  in  the \ncountry\u2019s first-ranked protection priority, and 29 bird species are listed in the International Union \nof Conservation Nature Red List of Threatened Species. The YNNRB is famous for the Red-\nCrowned Crane (Grus Japonensis). About 1,000 cranes, or 60% of the world\u2019s total, migrate \nevery winter to the YNNRB. \n \n                                                 \n1  The PPTA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 April 2007. \n2  In 2006, the per capita gross domestic product of the three counties was CNY4,472 for Binhai, CNY4,826 for \nXiangshui, and CNY6,017 for Funing, representing only 10% of that of Kunshan county (CNY52,078) in this \nprovince, and about one third of the national average of about CNY15,780.   \n ", "2   \n7.  The wetlands of Jiangsu provide important ecosystem services. Local livelihoods are \nsustained through the capture and culture of marine and estuarine plant (e.g., reeds), and fish \nspecies. Wetland plants slow the flow of rivers and the mudflats absorb wave energy from the \nYellow  Sea,  thereby  controlling  coastal  erosion.  Wetlands  also  improve  water  quality  by \nabsorbing some of the household and industry waste that is rapidly increasing in Yancheng \nmunicipality. \n \n8.  Yancheng\u2019s wetlands, despite their local, national, and global significance, have been \nunder threat. These threats include the following: \n \n(i)  Land reclamation and conversion have significantly altered the ecology of the \nwetlands. Reclamation of the intertidal and lower shore marshlands has involved \nthe construction of dikes for aquaculture and food crops. Conversion of the upper \ntidal marshlands has involved the clearing of the wetlands for crop production. A \nlarge part of the experimental and buffer zones have either been reclaimed or \nconverted, which has effectively reduced the habitat area suitable for wildlife. \n(ii)  The construction of roads and dikes inside the core zone and in the buffer and \nexperimental  zones  has  already  altered  the  hydrology  of  the  YNNRB  and \nDMNNR. These structures have \u201ccompartmentalized\u201d significant portions of the \nreserves and prevent the natural flow of water.  \n(iii)  Alien species, such as Spartina alterniflora, originally introduced to stabilize the \nmudflats have expanded rapidly over a large area of the YNNRB and DMNNR \nand into natural salt marshes.3 \n(iv)  Increasing pollution loads generated in the upstream areas of the many rivers \ncrossing the wetlands contribute to acute pollution of the tideland, the offshore \nsandbars, and the nearby sea. It also has potentially far-reaching effects on \ndeclines in water flow and sediment from the rivers. \n \n9.  Yancheng coastal ecosystem is a mosaic of diverse coastal habitats and users. Its\u2019 \nmanagement and protection involves many different sectors with many conflicting interests and \npolicies. Sustainable wetland planning and management can be achieved when all stakeholders \nare united and engage in a collaborative process to define problems and possible solutions. \nSignificant barriers preventing the development of integrated management for the valuable \necosystems in Yancheng include the following: \n  \n(i)  No specific wetland regulations exist to balance wetland conservation with other \nconflicting activities including agriculture, industry, and urban development. \n(ii)  No  ecosystem  services  and  the  potential  to  improve  downstream  water \nconditions (like the Majiadao wetland area) are recognized to provide incentives \nfor relatively poor upstream users to internalize downstream costs.  \n(iii)  Current  financial  sources  from  each  level  of  government  are  insufficient  to \nsupport wetland conservation, particularly in terms of compensating farmers who \nwill be banned from farming or fishing within the wetland areas.  \n                                                 \n3 Liu Jin\u2019e, Hongxia Zhou, Pei Qin, and Jun Zhou. 2007.

The governments of Jiangsu province and Yancheng municipality are fully aware of \nthese problems, and understand the need to urgently address them. In recent years, with \nacceleration of urbanization and industrialization, these governments have been extensively \ndiscussing how to improve coordination of wetland functions and to integrate management of \nwetland protection, biodiversity conservation, and watershed management. Improved alternative \nlivelihood  options  for  resource  users  are  emphasized  as  an  integral  part  of  the  wetland \nprotection  strategy.  The  positive  sign  of  all  of  these  discussions  is  the  development  of \necotourism, which is becoming an increasingly important sector for Jiangsu province, and in \nparticular, Yancheng municipality. \n \n11.  Promoting environmental improvement is one of the strategic priorities in the country \nstrategy and program update (2006\u20132008) for ADB operations in the PRC.4 The proposed \nProject will address (i) threats to the ecological integrity of the coastal ecosystems and their \nability to support globally-significant plant and animal species, and (ii) ecosystem services that \nare important to the local economy. Management plans will be prepared or updated through an \ninclusive process to guide the interventions in the core, buffer, and experimental zones. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The impact of the PPTA is improved management of wetlands, natural resources, and \nenvironmental sustainability in YMG. The outcome will be a sound project design for integrated \nconservation  and  development  of  Yancheng  coastal  and  upstream  ecosystems  and  its \nwatersheds (biodiversity, water, and forests). The PPTA will assist the Government in preparing \na  project  based  on  the  YMG\u2019s  initial  proposals  to  address  the  technical,  financial,  and \ninstitutional barriers. The Project is expected to transform wetland conservation through the \nsustainable  implementation  of  ecotourism  by  integrating  it  with  biodiversity  conservation, \nsustainable  resource  management,  improved  ecotourism  service,  and  strengthened \nenvironmental governance.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n13.  The PPTA outputs will include (i) sector situation analysis, and institutional and technical \nassessments  including  a  comprehensive  assessment  and  action  plans  for  sustaining  the \nbiodiversity  of  the  coastal  and  upstream  areas;  (ii)  development  of  an  integrated  plan  for \nYancheng wetland conservation, a multisector participatory plan, and a sustainable livelihood \nplan,  based  on  which  the  project  rationale  and  approach  as  well  as  a  preliminary  list  of \nsubprojects  will  be  identified;  and  (iii)  formulation  of  an  investment  project  with  detailed \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

The PPTA will be implemented in two phases using a participatory approach. During the \nfirst  phase,  the  consultant  team  will  (i)  conduct  assessments  of  sector  policy,  institutions, \nstrategies, and plans; (ii) appraise the project proposals from YMG; and (iii) confirm the project \nrationale, scope, and approach. During the second phase, in consultation with the stakeholders, \nthe consultant team will prepare a comprehensive feasibility report. The report will cover in \ndetail the project impact, outcome, outputs, and activities\u2014including financial, economic, social, \nand environmental safeguards; relevant sector analysis; role and institutional capacity of key \nparticipating agencies; procurement; implementation arrangements; and poverty status, gender, \ngood governance, and private sector development. Throughout both phases, ADB\u2019s project \nperformance management system guidelines will be followed and this will ultimately be reflected \nin the project design and monitoring framework, which will be developed based on effective \nstakeholder participation and guided by the problem and objectives analysis. Key activities for \neach output are included in the PPTA design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent (Appendix 3). ADB will \nfinance  $650,000  equivalent  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB  technical  assistance  funding \nprogram. The Government will contribute $150,000 in-kind for office space, counterpart staff, \nsite transportation, and other services.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  YMG will be the Executing Agency. A multiagency municipal leading group5 will be \nestablished to serve as the steering committee. The group will provide overall guidance to the \nPPTA. Specifically, its functions are to (i) assist in overseeing the preparation of the investment \nplan; (ii) review the selection criteria for subprojects; (iii) ensure municipal, provincial, and \ncentral  government  institutional  coordination;  and  (iv)  assist  the  technical  assistance \nmanagement office (TMO) and consultants to secure all the internal approvals pertaining to land \nacquisition and other necessary safeguards, etc.  \n \n17.  The Government has designated the Yancheng Development and Reform Committee as \nthe  lead  agency  to  oversee  PPTA  implementation.  A  TMO  will  be  established  in  YMG \ncomprising representatives of Yancheng Development and Reform Committee and the financial, \nenvironmental, forestry, and tourism bureaus. The TMO will (i) facilitate coordination among the \nconcerned agencies in YMG, PPTA consultants, and ADB; (ii) formulate selection criteria for the \nsubprojects;  (iii)  provide  access  to  data  and  other  information  required  for  sector  and \ninstitutional assessments, and project formulation and development; (iv) prepare and submit the \nsubproject  proposals  and  feasibility  study  reports,  the  report  on  environmental  impact \nassessments, and resettlement (including compensation and alternative livelihoods) plans for \nthe subprojects; (v) assist in assessing training needs and conducting necessary surveys; and \n(vi) ensure the active participation of the major stakeholders during PPTA implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n5  The members of the leading group are from the bureaus of finance, planning, tourism, ocean and fishery, tideland \nresources development, environmental protection, water resources, forestry, YNNRB, DMNNR, and the four \nYancheng counties Dafeng, Dongtai, Funing, and Sheyang. ", "            5\n18.  The TMO will also be responsible for carrying out preliminary surveys on the biodiversity \nand wetlands in the project areas including (i) wetland characteristics and their development \nover time (habitats, species, vegetation, human settlement and activities, water flows, depth, \nquality, and sedimentation); (ii) a land use inventory (type and area covered by wetlands, \nagriculture, industry, and urban areas) to provide the background information to develop a \nconservation policy framework; and (iii) socioeconomic information, including projections based \non current plans (population in wetland areas, land reclamation and conversion, agricultural \nintensification,  aquaculture,  urbanization,  industrial  development,  tourism  and  recreation \ndemand,  water  management  and  drainage  regime,  and  pollution  sources).  The  TMO  will \nestablish a technical task force to assist the TMO in selecting the subprojects, and providing \nguidance to the qualified design institute for the preparation of the subproject feasibility studies, \nand environmental and resettlement reports. \n \n19.  The subproject selection criteria will include (i) consistency with the national, provincial, \nand  municipal  objectives  of  the  11th  Five-Year  Plan  on  Environmental  Protection;  \n(ii) demonstration of linkages to effectively contribute to reducing the main causes of wetland \ndegradation;  (iii)  adoption  of  reversible  restoration  approaches,  especially  creek  and  river \nstraightening, and dredging; (iv) viablility, i.e., participating enterprises or entities having sound \nhistorical financial performance; and (v) minimum needs for resettlement. The current proposal \nneeds  to  be  refined  to  sharpen  the  focus  of  wetland  and  biodiversity  conservation,  and \ndemonstrate the clear contributions of upstream activities to the restoration of wetlands and \nhabitats of animal and plant species that are mainly in the coastal areas.  \n \n20.  Given the nature and activities of the Project, Global Environmental Facility cofinancing \nwill be sought to enhance the global environmental benefits. It will include the design of the \nensuing grant-financing investment to complement the ADB loan-financed project.   \n \n21.  The PPTA will be carried out by a firm. It will require international consultants for 12 \nperson-months  and  national  consultants  for  45  person-months.  The  draft  outline  terms  of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 4. The consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will select and engage consultants on the basis of the quality of their proposals and \nthe cost of the services to be provided (with a quality cost ratio of 80:20), following simplified \ntechnical proposal procedures. YMG will procure office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultants will submit (i) \nan inception report, 4 weeks after commencement of services; (ii) an interim progress report at \nappropriate stages of PPTA implementation; (iii) a draft final report, 20 weeks after PPTA \ncommencement; and (iv) a final report, 2 weeks after incorporating YMG and ADB comments.6 \nThe PPTA will commence in February 2008 and be completed in July 2008. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  preparing  the  Jiangsu  Yancheng \nWetlands Protection Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  All reports must be submitted in English and Chinese.  \n ", "6          Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nImproved management of  By 2012, water and  Natural reserve statistics  \u2022  Government policies \nwetlands, natural  wetland quality in the    continue to promote \nresources, and  protected area improved    integrated ecosystem and \nenvironmental  from the 2008 baseline.    watershed conservation. \nsustainability in YMG       \n  By 2012, population of   \nendangered species in  Project monitoring reports \nYNNRB and DMNNR is \nstable or has increased \nfrom the 2008 baseline.  \n \n \nOutcome      Assumption \n       \nProject design for  Agreement reached  MOU signed by the  \u2022  Provincial project \nintegrated conservation  between the PRC  Government and ADB  prefeasibility studies are \nand development of YMG  Government and ADB on  completed with adequate \ncoastal and upstream  the final loan project  quality and detail before \necosystem and their  design by 2008.  mobilization of the PPTA \nwatersheds     consultants. \n \n \n Risk \n\u2022  Lack of effective \ncollaboration and \ncommunication among the \nkey government agencies. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n(i)  Situation analysis,  Inception report (week 4).

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe Project is expected to enhance sustainable use and conservation of the wetlands in Yancheng, while reducing \nrural poverty by establishing integrated wetland management. The Project directly contributes to poverty reduction by \n(i) targeting the poor in one of the more underdeveloped areas within the province that suffers from high income \ninequality; (ii) reducing social vulnerability by promoting sustainable use of natural resources, which are the primary \nsource of income for local communities; and (iii) vitalizing the local economy and developing alternative means of \nincome generation by introducing ecotourism in collaboration with the private sector.  \n \nThe Project is aligned with the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan 2006\u20132010, which aims at balanced, equitable, and \nsustainable development. The Project directly addresses the two central issues of income equality reduction and \nenvironmental protection.  \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.

Poverty Analysis \n \n1.    If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n       \n  The Project is classified as \u201cgeneral intervention.\u201d  \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \n \nTwo specialists, a sustainable livelihood and social development specialist and resettlement specialist, in consultation \nwith other experts, will review social, gender, and poverty impact assessments to ensure that the Project does not \nhave negative repercussions, and if any, to identify mitigating measures. These specialists will develop strategies to \nimprove social inclusion and rural livelihoods using a participatory approach.  \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nThe Project will be designed to (i) reduce social vulnerability through the promotion of sustainable use of natural \nresources, and (ii) vitalize the local economy and develop alternative means of income generation through the \nintroduction of ecotourism in collaboration with the private sector.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "        Appendix 2           9\nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n \nA.   Initial Social Analysis \n  Based on existing information: \n \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \n \nThe primary beneficiaries are the local communities, which are primarily poor and use natural resources from the \nwetlands for their living. The process and outcome of the Project will benefit the poor in several ways. First, an \ninclusive participatory approach will be used in the design process. This provides the poor with opportunities to \nprovide inputs into critical decision making for natural resource management that has a direct impact on their \nlivelihood. Local government officials and consultants will monitor and ensure the quality of participation. Second, \nmore managed use of natural resources minimizes their social vulnerability. And finally, planned investments in \necotourism as an alternative source of income generation will diversify and improve household income prospects.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nAs communities have long depended on aquaculture and farming, they will not be able to switch quickly to non-\nresource-intensive livelihoods. Accordingly, the Project will (i) conduct awareness raising of the community on \nsustainable use of resources, (ii) conduct capacity building on how to minimize adverse environmental impacts, and \n(iii) explore ways to build the community\u2019s capacity to participate in ecotourism as an alternative livelihood.  \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem? \n \nTwo potential constraints are (i) farmers who may be banned from farming or fishing within the buffer zone may \noppose the Project, and (ii) farmers may reject altering their livelihoods to non-resource-intensive ones thus nullifying \nthe potential benefits ecotourism could bring. To address these issues, the project design will include (i) a sustainable \nlivelihood plan; (ii) cofinancing program with the Global Environment Facility on a monitoring and evaluation system \nfor protected area management; and (iii) partnership with the current United Nations Development Programme/Global \nEnvironment Facility, which is now focused on awareness and education development for natural conservation. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n       1.   Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \nFarmer/fisher groups, community-based organizations engaged in natural resources management and conservation, \nand members of the executing and implementing agencies will be the main participants in planning, implementing, \nand evaluating activities. Private sector stakeholders will be consulted to explore potential ecotourism opportunities.  \n \n  2.   What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \n  community mobilization, involvement of nongovernment organizations and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nCommunity members and community-based organizations will be consulted to identify their needs and views on the \nProject, which will then be relayed to the intergovernmental steering committee and the technical assistance \nmanagement office.  \n \n3.    What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n              Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.    Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nFarmers and community consultation and participation are critical to ensure project sustainability. A C&P plan will be \nprepared. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.    What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nThe two key issues are (i) insufficient or lack of women\u2019s participation in community decision-making process; and\n(ii) limited access by  women to employment opportunities and income, thereby exacerbating  women\u2019s social \nvulnerability.  \n \n    2.
