The SME and \nmanufacturing  sectors  are  currently  underrepresented  in  the \nnational economy. However, the SME sector is relatively more \nlabor-intensive, contributing approximately 40% of employment. \nSME growth is hence significantly more inclusive and \u201cpro-poor\u201d in \nnature, and therefore it is of key importance to create conditions \nfor growth of the SME sector.  \n \nOne  of  the  most  pressing  problems  identified  for  SME \ndevelopment  in  Kazakhstan  is  difficulty  in  accessing  capital, \nespecially debt financing. For the companies that drive pro-poor \ngrowth,  such  as  manufacturing-sector  SMEs,  funding  is  a \nconstraint. If Kazakhstan is to move out of its heavy dependence \non oil exports and to further develop SMEs\u2014and especially in the \nmanufacturing  sector\u2014then  these  hurdles  will  have  to  be \novercome. \n   \nJustification  The proposed loan is justified for the following reasons: \n \nDevelopment  Impact.  Diversification  of  the  economy  toward \nnon-oil investments is crucial for Kazakhstan\u2019s sustainable and \ninclusive  economic  development.  Kazakhstan  faces  two \nchallenges in creating a sustainable economic base for after the \noil boom recedes. The first is to achieve economic diversification, \nboth  through  strengthening  the  non-oil  sectors  of  the  real ", "ii   \neconomy and through appropriate diversification of its growing \nfinancial assets. Improving access to finance by SMEs helps to \nachieve  both  of  these.  The  second  challenge  is  to  improve \ntransparency standards in the financing of private firms, especially \nSMEs. ADB\u2019s proposed loans will directly contribute to expanded \nfinancial intermediation to SMEs, including those in rural areas, \nvia  the  existing  and  growing  branch  networks  of  the  selected \nbanks, and they will foster the diversification of loan portfolios.  \n \nValue Added by ADB. ADB\u2019s proposed loan will add value by \n(i) enabling  BTA  to  grow  its  SME  loan  portfolios;  (ii) providing \naccess to longer maturities, thus matching assets and liabilities; \nand (iii) increasing depositor confidence in Kazakhstan\u2019s relatively \nyoung banking market. ADB\u2019s loans would be specifically targeted \nat SMEs and will contribute to strengthening the selected banks\u2019 \ncapacity to serve the SME sector.  \n   \nEnvironmental and  Environment category: FI \nSocial Guidelines  Indigenous peoples and resettlement category: C \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nsenior loan of up to $75 million to Bank TuranAlem (BTA). BTA is focused on lending to small \nand medium enterprises (SMEs) in Kazakhstan.  \n  \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  Kazakhstan Economy: Overview and Outlook \n \n2.  Kazakhstan maintained its solid economic growth in 2005 (in excess of 9% during \nJanuary\u2013September 2005) that is based on foreign direct investments in the energy sector, \nincreased pipeline export capacity, conservative fiscal and monetary policy balancing increased \npublic programs with price stability, and strong banking system regulation and supervision. \nContinued fiscal discipline seems likely, with approval of the 2006 budget deficit at 1.4% of GDP. \nFor 2006, GDP growth is predicted to be sustained at 8.5%. The country has benefited in recent \ntimes from higher oil prices and greater exports, both of which have increased foreign currency \ninflow and assisted debt-servicing efforts. For these economic strengths, Kazakhstan is rated \nBaa3 by Moody\u2019s and BBB by Standard and Poor\u2019s with a positive/stable outlook. For more \ndetails on the economic assessment, please refer to Appendix 1. \n \n3.  Nevertheless, Kazakhstan\u2019s high dependence on oil exports poses a potential threat for \nthe economy given potential volatility in the international oil market. To mitigate such risk, in this \ntime of growth, the Kazakhstan Government has created a National Fund that would, if needed, \nreduce  the  country\u2019s  vulnerability  to  external  commodity  price  shocks.  Moreover,  the \nGovernment is pushing hard for higher diversification of the economy, especially by promoting \nthe  SME  sector  alongside  strong  commercial  development  of  the  financial  (principally  the \nbanking) sector.  \n \nB.  Small and Medium Enterprises\u2019 Contribution to the Economy   \n \n1.  SMEs\u2019 Contribution to the Economy and Government Focus \n4.  The Kazakhstan economy is heavily dominated by and dependent on its oil and other \nnatural resources exports. The SME and manufacturing sectors are currently underrepresented \nin the national economy.1 However, the SME sector is relatively more labor-intensive, providing \napproximately 40% of total employment. SME growth is hence significantly more inclusive and \n\u201cpro-poor\u201d in nature, and therefore creating conditions for growth of the SME sector is of key \nimportance.  \n \n5.  Consequently,  SME  development  has  become  a  focus  area  for  the  Kazakhstan \nGovernment. It has a declared policy of fostering the development of SMEs, and especially of \nsmall businesses, by promulgating certain SME laws2 and establishing several organizations to \nimplement this policy.3  \n                                                 \n1  The SME sector is estimated to have contributed only 14%\u201315% of GDP in 2005. \n2  Law on State Support to Development of Small Business in the Republic of Kazakhstan. \n3 The policy has included various support measures, provision of services via business development centers, and \n \nsmall business loans. There is also an exhibition and information center (a wholly state-owned joint-stock company) \nthat works in accordance with the Government's program to support SMEs. In addition, the Government set up the \nSME Support Fund in 1997 as a nonbanking financial institution. The main objective of the fund is to effectively use ", "2   \n \n2.  Scarcity of Capital as Major Constraint for Small and  Medium Enterprise \nDevelopment \n6.  In  a  survey  on  small  businesses  conducted  by  UNDP,4 one  of  the  most  pressing \nproblems identified for SME development was the difficulty in accessing capital, especially debt \nfinancing. For the companies that drive pro-poor growth, such as manufacturing-sector SMEs, \nfunding is a serious constraint. Sources of credit were mostly family and friends, as well as \nmoneylenders in an informal sector.5 If Kazakhstan wants to move out of its heavy dependence \non oil exports and to further develop the SME segment\u2014and especially the manufacturing \nsector\u2014then these hurdles will have to be overcome. \n \nC.  Banking Sector in Kazakhstan \n \n1.  Introduction \n7.  Kazakhstan\u2019s financial sector has grown rapidly in recent years, with improvements in \nthe  economic  and  operating  environment  through  the  past  5  years  leading  to  enhanced \ncreditworthiness and commercial profiles for the domestic banking sector. In particular, the \nGovernment  and  National  Bank  of  Kazakhstan  (NBK),  the  central  bank,  have  undertaken \nstructural reforms aimed at promoting consolidation and improving the overall viability of the \nbanking system. \n \n8.  Encouraged by the improving macroeconomic environment and robust growth, Kazakh \nbanks have increased lending volumes by an average of more than 40% per year in the last 5 \nyears  (albeit  from  a  very  low  base)  while  generally  maintaining  healthy  asset  quality  and \nprofitability. This is especially true for the top performers within the first two tiers of the banking \nsystem. Market observers expect this pace of growth to be sustained throughout 2006. While \nfocusing mainly on the domestic market, some Kazakh banks are increasingly expanding their \noperations in other regional Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, including \nKyrgyz Republic, Russia, and Ukraine, in order to expand and diversify their businesses and \nmarket exposures. \n \n9.  Kazakhstan\u2019s financial sector has several strong points compared with those of other \nCentral Asian and CIS countries. First, the size of the sector relative to GDP is significantly \nlarger than are those in other Central Asian countries. The ratio of bank credit to GDP reached \n27% in 2004, which is roughly twice as high as those in Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan.6 Second, while the development of the local bond markets has lagged behind that \nof  the  banking  system,  domestic  pension  funds  have  increasingly  emerged  as  important \ninvestors in the local bond market since the launch of the pension reform in 1998. The steadily \naccumulating  pension  funds  provide  a  supply  of  long-term  funds  that  is  lacking  in  most \n \nfinancial resources allocated within the framework of state and regional programs for projects and activities aimed \nat supporting SMEs. The fund is tasked to (i) broaden access to finance for SMEs, (ii) effectively use state and \nnonstate resources aimed at SME support, (iii) develop SME infrastructure, and (iv) provide consultations for SMEs. \n4  United Nations Development Program (UNDP). 2002.  \n5  As of end 1999, only about 20% of the private sector credit came from commercial banking. To access funds \noutside the formal  banking sector, businesspersons reported that they often were forced to operate in the informal \nsector so that the identities of those supplying them with funds could be concealed. Repayment is enforced by \nsocial pressure (and also the fear of physical harm). \n6  However, 27% bank credit to GDP remains quite low when compared to more developed markets, where it is \ntypically near or even above 100%. \n ", "  3\nemerging markets, including many other former Central Asian and CIS countries. Third, the core \nlegal framework for the financial sector is already in place.  \n \n2.  Overview \n10.  The commercial banks in Kazakhstan can be divided into four groups: (i) large local \nbanks (Tier I Banks),7 such as BTA and its principal competitors, which are Kazkommertsbank \n(KKB)  and  Halyk  Bank;  (ii)  banks  under  foreign  ownership,  such  as  ABN  AMRO  Bank \nKazakhstan, HSBC Bank Kazakhstan and Citibank Kazakhstan; (iii) second tier (Tier II Banks) \nmedium-sized banks with a regional footprint; and (iv) smaller local banks. The decrease in the \nnumber of banks from 184 in 1996 to the current 348 is primarily attributable to the ongoing \nsector reform undertaken by NBK.  \n \n11.  Reform  of  the  banking  sector  began  in  1996  with  the  introduction  of  international \nprudential standards, including requirements on capital adequacy, liquidity ratios, transparency \nas to the auditing of banks by local and international auditors, harmonization of local accounting \npractices  to  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS),  and  personnel  training \nprograms. In addition, NBK required commercial banks to adopt recapitalization and corporate \nenhancement plans with the aim of boosting their abilities to attract long-term, private investors. \nIn  2000,  guidelines  were  established  for  bank  inspections  and  for  periodic  reporting  by \ncommercial banks to NBK (and now also to the Financial Markets Supervisory Agency, or \nFMSA, which currently is the banking supervision body in Kazakhstan). In 2003, all banks were \nrequested to develop and install internal risk management systems. \n  \n3.  Credit Standing of Commercial Banks \n12.  The financial standings of Kazakhstan\u2019s banks vary. As of 30 September 2005, 18 of the \n34 commercial banks had registered capital of over T2 billion, 15 banks had registered capital of \nover T2 billion, 15 banks had share capital of T1 billion to T2 billion, and one bank had \nregistered capital of T500 million to T1 billion. There are no banks with registered capital of less \nthan T500 million, and any bank whose capital falls below this level is required to submit to \nFMSA an application for voluntary reorganization into an entity performing only limited banking \noperations. As of 30 September 2005, aggregate provisions of Kazakh banks on overdue \nreceivables were T52.5 billion. \n \n13.  As of 31 December 2005, all of the commercial banks licensed in Kazakhstan were in \ncompliance with prudential regulatory requirements on capital adequacy, single borrower limits, \nliquidity ratios, foreign currency limits, and reserve requirements. As of 31 December 2004, two \ncommercial  banks  had  failed  to  comply  with  seven  prudential  regulatory  requirements, \ncompared to one bank out of compliance as of 31 December 2003 and one as of 31 December \n2002 (BTA was not among these banks). The banks out of compliance did not meet any of the \ncurrent liquidity ratios, own capital ratios, single borrower exposure ratio, open currency position \nratio and maximum asset investment ratio. Provisions for bad debts of all banks operating in the \nKazakhstan banking sector as of 31 August 2005 totaled T52.5 billion. \n \n                                                 \n7  Technically, NBK would be the first tier. The terminology used here therefore only refers to commercial banks \nbelow NBK. \n8 As of August 2005, there were 34 banks operating in Kazakhstan, excluding NBK, which included two fully \nstate-owned special-purpose banks and 14 banks under foreign ownership. As of mid-2004, there were 27 \nrepresentative offices of foreign banks. \n ", "4   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \nA.  Project Selection \n \n14.  Missions to Kazakhstan, in April and November 2005, respectively, by the Private Sector \nOperations Department (PSOD) met with key Government officials and identified several banks \nfor potential cooperation. These missions were preceded by a visit of ADB\u2019s Board to the region \nthat identified an urgent need for ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations to increase its presence in \nthe market. This mandate aligns with the recognition in the Medium Term Strategy II paper of \nMarch 2006 that the financial sector represents the top \u201cCore I\u201d focus for ADB. Subsequently, \nthe Private Sector Operations Division (PSOP) of PSOD has deepened discussions with banks \nin Kazakhstan.  \n \n15.  ADB has just started to explore private sector opportunities in Kazakhstan and other \nCentral Asian republics, as these countries\u2019 framework agreements with ADB have been signed \nonly recently. To create a sustainable footprint for ADB in this region, from both the risk and \ndevelopmental perspectives, PSOP has taken a balanced approach and chosen two countries \nfor its first moves: Azerbaijan9 and Kazakhstan. ADB recognizes that Kazakhstan is certainly a \nmore developed country in the CIS region. \n \nB.  Bank TuranAlem \n \n1.  Overview and History \n16.  Bank TuranAlem JSC (TuranAlem or BTA) is a leading commercial bank in Kazakhstan, \nheadquartered in Almaty, and offering a full range of traditional banking products and services. \nBTA was incorporated in January 1997 as a closed joint-stock company and arose from the \nrestructuring and merger of two state-owned banks, Alem Bank and Turan Bank, pursuant to a \ndecision of the Government and NBK. Having been recapitalized by the Government, BTA was \nfully privatized at a competitive auction in March 1998 and reorganized from a closed joint-stock \ncompany into an open joint-stock company in December 1998. By September 2003, the bank \nhad completed its reregistration as a joint-stock company and had adopted a new charter.  \n \n2.  BTA\u2019s Business \n17.  BTA\u2019s principal business areas include corporate banking, retail banking, trade finance, \ncredit and debit card services, and currency and securities trading. \n \na.  Corporate Banking \n \n18.  BTA has a wide range of corporate customers, including many of the country\u2019s leading \nindustrial  companies  but  primarily  SMEs.  A  major  part  of  BTA\u2019s  business  with  respect  to \ncorporates consists of providing trade finance and short-term credit facilities, mostly in tenge \nand US dollars. These include letters of credit, guarantees, and working capital. \n  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2006.

The SME sector has historically been of primary importance for BTA, which has been \nfurther encouraged by the Government\u2019s current emphasis on developing the SME segment in \nKazakhstan.  \n \n3.  Ownership: Principal Shareholders \n20.  Following  BTA\u2019s  privatization  in  1998,  a  number  of  local  private  sector  companies \npurchased all of the bank\u2019s shares. In recent years, BTA has increased its share capital and \nexpanded its shareholder base. \n \n4.  BTA\u2019s Credit Ratings  \n21.  Currently, BTA is rated by two rating agencies: Fitch and Moody\u2019s Investors Service. \nCurrent ratings are as follow: \n \nTable 7: Bank TuranAlem Credit Ratings \n \nFitch  Rating  Moody\u2019s  Rating \nLong-term  BB+  Long-term  Baa2 \nShort-term  B  Short-term  NP \nOutlook  Stable  Outlook  Positive \n  Source: BTA. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n22.  ADB is contemplating a senior, unsecured loan for $75 million. \n  \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification of ADB's Loan \n \n1.  Investment Objective \n23.  ADB\u2019s objective in the proposed transaction is to assist BTA in growing its SME loan \nportfolios by providing part of the needed debt funding and, in turn, to assist the Government of \nKazakhstan in its efforts to steer the Kazakh economy towards a more sustainable SME-led \ngrowth while diversifying away from the dominance and dependence on natural resources \nindustries.  \n \n2.  Development Outcome \n24.  Kazakhstan faces two challenges to create a sustainable economic base for after the oil \nboom recedes. The first is to achieve economic diversification, both through strengthening the \nnon-oil  sectors  of  the  real  economy  and  through  appropriate  diversification  of  its  growing \nfinancial assets, particularly through improving access to finance by SMEs. The second is to \nimprove standards of transparency in the financing of private firms, especially SMEs. ADB\u2019s \nproposed loans will directly contribute to expanding financial intermediation to SMEs\u2014including \n ", "6   \nthose in rural areas\u2014via the existing and growing branch network of the selected banks, as well \nas foster the diversification of loan portfolios.  \n \n25.  As discussed in Section II, the diversification of the economy toward non-oil investments \nis a crucial factor for Kazakhstan\u2019s sustainable and inclusive economic development. While \noverall investment ratios have been increasing over the past few years, the investment ratio for \nthe non-oil sectors has remained stagnant at around 7% of GDP.10 Although the country is \nmodernizing its extractive industries, with mining and metals contributing significantly to the \nlocal economy, non-oil exports have been sluggish at around $2 billion since 1997.11 \n \n3.  Value Added of ADB  \n26.  ADB\u2019s proposed loans will add value by (i) enabling BTA to grow its SME loan portfolios; \n(ii) providing access to longer maturities, thus better matching assets and liabilities; and (iii) \nincreasing depositor confidence in Kazakhstan\u2019s relatively young banking market. ADB\u2019s loans \nwould be specifically targeted at SMEs and will contribute to strengthening the selected banks\u2019 \ncapacity to serve the SME sector.  \n \n4.  Measures for Development Impact \n27.  PSOP will measure the expected development impact of the proposed loans. These \nperformance  measures  follow  the  multilateral  development  banks\u2019  Evaluation  Cooperation \nGroup's Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Development impact \nis  measured  in  three  distinct  categories:  (i)  business  performance  of  the  project  itself,  (ii) \neconomic sustainability, and (iii) private sector development. Examples of development impact \nmeasures are provided below. Appendix 2 shows the full development impact framework. \n \n5.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n28.  In view of the Government\u2019s medium-term targets for 2010, the development of a vibrant \nand competitive private sector is vital to ensure economic diversification as well as balanced \nand inclusive development. The Government has a particular focus on SME development and \non deepening and developing the financial sector. The ADB program, as set out in the private \nsector development section of the country strategy and program for Kazakhstan,12 seeks to \ncomplement the Government\u2019s efforts through increased activities in private sector operations.13 \n \n29.  As a result, the ADB Kazakhstan country strategy and program update 2006\u20132008 \nemphasizes the Government\u2019s policy on SME development to create jobs and recommends \nADB assistance through providing credit to SMEs via domestic banks.  \n \n30.  Therefore,  the  proposed  loans  will  directly  contribute  to  implementing  the  country \nstrategy and program for Kazakhstan by fostering financial intermediation for SMEs. Indirectly, \nthe assistance also supports rural area development, as the selected banks are providing loans \nto SMEs in these areas. The portfolio approach taken (Section III.A.) will ensure sustainability of \nADB\u2019s intervention from a risk and development perspective. \n \n                                                 \n10 World Bank. 2005.

Moreover, PSOP\u2019s initiatives are part of a wider effort to improve the efficiency of the \nfinancial sector, as these are accompanied by policy dialogue. The involvement of ADB\u2019s public \nsector  operations  through  the  East  and  Central  Asia  Regional  Department  ensures  the \nnecessary Government discussions enabling both a strong financial sector and reform in SME \nfinance.  \n \n32.  The Central and Western Asia Regional Department has undertaken various projects to \nincrease ADB private sector operations in Kazakhstan. For instance, Technical Assistance KAZ: \nUrban Small Business Development14 has the objectives to promote development of the urban \nSME  sector,  review  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework  for  SMEs,  and  foster  financial \nintermediation.  Most  recently,  ADB  has  approved  Technical  Assistance  KAZ:  Republic  of \nKazakhstan Financial Sector Governance Phase II,15 which seeks to foster a sound, efficient, \nand broad financial system by strengthening the supervision of banks, accumulation of pension \nfunds, and operations of asset management companies. This assistance will play a central role \nin  supporting  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations  in  the  financial  sector  and  in  strengthening \ndomestic banks.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n \n33.  The proposed loans have been assigned an \u201cFI\u201d environmental classification and a \u201cC\u201d \nwith respect to indigenous people and resettlement. The implementation of an environmental \nmanagement  system  represents  an  essential  value  addition  by  ADB  to  these  financing \ntransactions.  \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy: Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n \n34.  BTA has been advised of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and of policy relating to combating \nmoney  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require BTA to institute, maintain, and \ncomply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards for \npreventing corruption, money laundering activities, and the financing of terrorism.   \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n35. I am satisfied that the two proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the financial \nintermediation loan of up to $75,000,000 (in dollar and/or tenge) to Bank TuranAlem, from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined based on the procedures \napplicable to ADB\u2019s private sector operations and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the \nBoard. \n                  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n22 May 2006 \n                                                 \n14 ADB.  2001.

Economic Outlook \n \n1.  High oil prices, foreign investment, and good macroeconomic management underlie the \ncontinuing economic boom in this oil-rich export economy. Gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth, led by the oil sector, averaged 9.5% during 2002\u20132004 and 9.4% in 2005. Furthermore, \nrepresenting 65% of GDP, the private sector is increasingly driving growth in the economy.1  \n \n2.  The  above  mentioned  factors  helped  lift  2005\u2019s  general  budget  revenues  by  4.7 \npercentage points to 28.2% of GDP. This large gain was somewhat offset by the increase in \nbudgetary spending before the December presidential election. The general government budget \nrecorded a surplus of 0.6% of GDP, from a slight deficit of 0.3% in 2004. In view of its strong \nfinancial position, the Government made early repayments totaling $850 million on its external \npublic debt, reducing the total to about 4% of GDP at end-2005. The 2006 state budget was \napproved in November 2005. It raised revenues by 2% of GDP from the previous year\u2019s level, \nreflecting government projections for greater receipts from oil. The increase is earmarked for \npublic investment and social programs.2 \n \n3.  High world commodity prices helped ramp up exports by 40.0% to $28.7 billion, oil and \nmetals accounted for more than two thirds of the increase. Imports also leaped, by 37%, driven \nlargely by machinery, equipment, and nonprecious metals. The trade surplus improved by about \n45% to $9.8 billion, but the deficit on the services, income, and transfers account worsened \nsharply. The latter stemmed from greater payments for construction, freight, insurance, and \ninformation technology services, as well as a near doubling of income payments to foreign direct \ninvestors, nearly all associated with oil sector development. Consequently, the current account \nsurplus in 2005 improved only marginally from a year earlier to $750 million (about 1.3% of \nGDP). For the first time in 5 years, official reserves at the National Bank of Kazakhstan declined, \nthough they recovered substantially in the first 2 months of 2006. (Footnote 2) \n \n4.  Gross official reserves stood at $7.1 billion at end-2005 (equivalent to 37 months of \nimports of goods and services) while end-year foreign asset holdings of the National Fund of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan (NFRK),  which saves a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral \nrevenues for future generations, amounted to $8.0 billion. During the year, the total of official \nreserves and fund assets strengthened by about $684 million (about 1.2% of GDP) to $15.1 \nbillion. Outstanding public external debt was reduced by about $1.0 billion to $2.4 billion (about \n4.2% of GDP) in the 9 months to end-September 2005. In this period, private sector external \ndebt (excluding oil and gas intracompany debt) increased sharply by $4.6 billion to $16.6 billion \n(about 33% of GDP). The upsurge in private debt in recent years\u2014mainly local bank borrowing \nfor onlending\u2014was largely a response to the differential between available foreign borrowing \nrates and domestic lending rates of about 15% for tenge loans and 11% for loans denominated \nin foreign currency. (Footnote 2) \n \n5.  The tenge continued to appreciate against the US dollar (2.9%) on an average annual \nbasis, reflecting export earnings, foreign direct investment (FDI), and private external borrowing. \nHowever, tighter market conditions in the final months of 2005 resulted in a 2.2% depreciation \non an end-of-year basis. As in the previous year, the real effective exchange rate rose by about \n                                                 \n1 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimate. This is up from 55% of GDP in 1998. \n2  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006: 96\u201397. \n ", "    Appendix 1  9\n6% year on year, due to inflation differentials. Largely because of future substantial oil-related \nrevenues, real appreciation may continue in 2006. (Footnote 2)   \n \n6.  The  medium-term  outlook  is  positive,  assuming  buoyant  oil  prices,  foreign  direct \ninvestment inflows, continuation of economic diversification, good macroeconomic management, \nand political stability. In 2006, GDP growth is expected to be sustained at 8.5%. Moreover, \nmacroeconomic stabilization should continue, with inflation estimated at about 6.5% in 2006. \nDespite  recent  substantial  increases  in  wages  and  social  spending,  the  Government  of \nKazakhstan has maintained sustainable fiscal and monetary policies, which have limited budget \ndeficits and inflation. General government debt will continue to decrease in the next few years \nby about 1.0%\u20131.5% of GDP annually. Additionally, with the National Reserve Fund for excess \noil  earnings  and  tax  revenues  expected  to  reach  about  $7.4  billion  by  year-end  2005,  a \nsubstantial fiscal buffer has been created.3 Despite increased external borrowing by commercial \nbanks, the overall external position remains strong.\n \n \n7.  A  decomposition  shows  that  overall  growth  in  2000\u20132004  was  led  by  strong \ncontributions  from  capital  and  total  factor  productivity  (TFP).  The  contribution  of  labor \naccumulation declined continuously, suggesting that the economy is likely approaching full \nemployment. According to government data, the contributions of capital accumulation, TFP, and \nlabor growth to the average GDP rate of expansion of 10.4% in 2000\u20132004 were 6%, 3.2%, and \n1.2%, respectively.4  \n \n8.  The hydrocarbons sector has grown at an average of 16% a year since 2000, and will \nremain the locomotive of growth in the medium term. Its share in GDP, including production and \nrelated services, jumped from 11% in 2000 to almost 25% in 2005, and is expected to continue \nrising  as  production  capacity  increases.  Sector  growth  has  been  fueled  by  large  capital \ninvestments; oil and gas have received 60% of total investment, equivalent to 15% of GDP over \nthe 2000\u20132005 period. Two thirds of the oil and gas investment came from the private sector. \nThe share of hydrocarbons in GDP will increase over the medium term as large projects come \non stream, though investment in the sector is expected to taper off as a share of total fixed \ninvestment. (Footnote 4) \n \n9.  Non-oil output has risen at an average of 7% a year since 2000 and has been sustained \nat the rate of 25% of total investment, representing 6.5% of GDP in 2000\u20132005. Within the non-\noil sector, construction and services have been the most dynamic. Their combined share in \nGDP and total employment has increased to 65% and 60%, respectively. (Footnote 4) \n \n10.  In contrast, the share of manufacturing and agriculture in GDP has declined, reflecting \nlow capital investment. Their investment rate stood at 3% of GDP a year on average over the \nperiod, with half of that from the public sector. If the investment rate in the non-oil sector keeps \nto its recent trend, non-oil growth could well stay at 7\u20138% a year in the medium term\u2014and even \nhigher if the Government manages to diversify the economy and stimulate the private sector. \nRemoving impediments to regional trade and accession to the World Trade Organization would \nadvance development of both the non-oil and private sectors. (Footnote 4) \n \n11.  Continuing growth, job creation in the private sector, and pro-poor growth have raised \nliving standards. In 2004, real per capita incomes rose by 13%. The percentage of people living \n                                                 \n3  The National Fund of Kazakhstan was created in 2001 to accumulate a part of the Government\u2019s oil and mineral \nrevenues for stabilization purposes and to save for future generations. \n4  ADB. 2006. Asian Development Bank Outlook 2006: 98\u201399. \n ", "10        Appendix 1   \nbelow the subsistence minimum5 fell from 19.8% in 2003 to 15.0% in 2004. Unemployment \ndeclined from 8.8% in 2003 to 8.4% in 2004.  \n  \nB.  Political and Regional Background \n \n12.  Kazakhstan  became  an  independent  sovereign  state  in  1991  as  a  result  of  the \ndissolution of the former Soviet Union. Since then, Kazakhstan has experienced significant \nchange as it emerged from a single party political system and a centrally controlled command \neconomy  to  a  market-oriented,  democratic  model.  The  transition  was  initially  marked  by \npolitical  uncertainty  and  tension,  a  recessionary  economy  marked  by  high  inflation  and \ninstability of the local currency, and rapid but incomplete changes in the legal environment. \n \n13.  Since 1992, Kazakhstan has actively pursued a program of economic reform designed \nto establish a free-market economy through privatization of state enterprises and deregulation, \nand it is more advanced in this respect than some other countries of the CIS. However, as with \nany transition economy, there can be no assurance that such reforms and other reforms \ndescribed elsewhere in this proposal will continue or that such reforms will achieve all or any \nof their intended aims. \n \n14.  Kazakhstan depends on neighboring states to access world markets for a number of its \nmajor exports, including oil, steel, copper, ferro-alloys, iron ore, aluminum, coal, lead, zinc, \nand wheat. Kazakhstan is thus dependent upon good relations with its neighbors to ensure its \nability to export. In addition to taking various steps to promote regional economic integration \namong neighboring countries, Kazakhstan signed an agreement in September 2003 with \nBelarus, Russia, and Ukraine for creating a single economic zone, which is expected to result \nin common economic policies, harmonization of legislation implementing such policies, and \nthe creation of a single commission on trade and tariffs. The aim of the single economic zone \nis to create a free customs area within which member countries would enjoy free movement of \ngoods,  services,  capital,  and  labor.  Another  step  toward  integration  is  that  the  member \ncountries also intend to look at ways to coordinate their fiscal policies, credit and currency \npolicies,  and  government  policies. These  efforts  will  support  further  economic  integration \nwithin the CIS, one of the aims of which is to assure continued access to export routes. \n \nC.  Macroeconomic Considerations and Exchange Rate Policies \n \n15.  Since Kazakhstan is heavily dependent upon export trade and commodity prices, it \nwas particularly affected by the Asian financial crisis in early 1998 and by the Russian crisis \nlater that year, both of which exacerbated the problems associated with falling commodity \nprices. Because Kazakhstan\u2019s economy is negatively affected by low commodity prices and \neconomic instability elsewhere in the world, the Government has promoted economic reform, \ninward foreign investment, and diversification of the economy. Notwithstanding these efforts, \nhowever, low commodity prices and weak demand in its export markets may adversely affect \nKazakhstan\u2019s economy in the future. \n \n16.  The  Government  began  implementing  market-based  economic  reforms  in  1992, \nincluding to implement a significant privatization program, promote high levels of foreign direct \n                                                 \n5  The subsistence minimum is a measure of poverty. Calculated by the State Statistics Agency, it comprises the cost \nof a basket of 70% food items and 30% goods and services. The poverty line is established as a fixed percentage \nof the subsistence minimum, and it is used for determining households\u2019 social assistance allowances and eligibility \nfor such assistance. In 2004, the subsistence minimum was T5,427 or equivalent to $40 a month. \n ", "    Appendix 1  11\ninvestment  (particularly  in  the  oil  and  gas  sectors),  and  introduce  an  extensive  legal \nframework. Despite uneven progress in this regard, Kazakhstan has experienced extensive \neconomic  transformation  over  the  last  12  years.  Since  mid-1994,  the  Government  has \nadhered to a macroeconomic stabilization program aimed at curtailing inflation, reducing the \nfiscal deficit, and boosting international currency reserves. According to figures compiled by \nKazakhstan\u2019s National Statistical Agency, GDP has continued to grow in real terms following \nthe adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in April 1999. It rose by 13.5% in 2001, 9.8% in \n2002, 9.2% in 2003, and 9.4% in 2004. However, there can be no assurance that GDP will \ncontinue to grow, and any decrease in GDP or in the rate of GDP growth in subsequent years \ncould adversely affect Kazakhstan\u2019 development. \n \n17.  The tenge is convertible for current account transactions, although it is not a fully \nconvertible  currency  outside  Kazakhstan.  Between  1991,  when  Kazakhstan  began  its \ntransition to a market-based economy, and April 1999, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) \nmaintained a managed exchange rate policy, which, although permitting the general trend in \nthe exchange rate to reflect market conditions, involved official intervention aimed at limiting \nfluctuations.  Depressed  export  markets  in  1998  and  early  1999,  however,  caused \nconsiderable  pressure  on  Kazakhstan\u2019s  managed  exchange  rate  and  resulting  official \nintervention in the foreign exchange markets led to losses on foreign currency reserves. In \nresponse to these pressures, the authorities instituted a number of expenditure cuts, took \nrevenue increasing measures and, in April 1999, the NBK floated the tenge. The tenge fell by \n64.6% against the US dollar as of 31 December 1999, compared to a depreciation of 10.7% \nas of 31 December 1998. Following the adoption of a floating exchange rate policy in 1999, \nthe tenge continued to depreciate against the US dollar, although at a much slower rate. It \ndepreciated by 4.6% in 2000, by 3.8% in 2001, and 3.3% in 2002. The tenge subsequently \nappreciated against the US dollar by 7.3% during 2003 and by 9.9% during 2004. Then during \nthe first 6 months of 2005, it depreciated against the dollar by 4.0%, to T135.26, as of 30 June \n2005. Since then the tenge has gradually appreciated against the dollar and as of 11 May \n2006, the official T/$ exchange rate reported by the NBK was T122.87. \n \n18.  While the NBK has stated that is has no plans to resume a managed exchange rate \npolicy, there can be no assurance that the NBK\u2019s policy will not change, and any subsequent \ndecision to support the exchange rate could have an adverse impact on Kazakhstan\u2019s public \nfinances and economy. \n \nD.  Regulation of the Banking Industry \n \n19.  In  September  1995,  the  NBK  introduced  strict  prudential  requirements  for  the \noperations and the capital adequacy of banks. In addition, an institutional development plan \nwas prepared for leading Kazakhstan banks. According to the plan, banks are required to \nprepare their accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) \nand to apply the Basel Committee norms within the period determined by the NBK on a case-\nto-case basis. These norms apply to both banks. Further, Kazakhstan banks are required to \njoin  a  bank-funded  deposit  insurance  scheme  and  be  audited  annually  by  a  public \naccountancy firm approved by the NBK, which is likely to be one of the leading international \nfirms. Following legislative changes in July 2003, the Financial Markets Supervisory Agency \n(FMSA)  was  formed,  and,  as  of  1  January  2004,  it  took  responsibility  for  most  of  the \nsupervisory  and  regulatory  functions  in  the  financial  sector,  which  had  previously  been \nperformed by the NBK. The FMSA\u2019s main task is to regulate and supervise the financial \nmarkets and financial institutions in Kazakhstan. \n \n ", "12        Appendix 1   \nE.  Implementation of Further Market-Based Economic Reforms \n \n20.  The need for substantial investment in many enterprises has driven the Government\u2019s \nprivatization program. The program has excluded certain enterprises deemed strategically \nsignificant by the Government, although major privatizations in key sectors have taken place, \nsuch as full or partial sales of certain large oil and gas producers, mining companies, and the \nnational  telecommunication  company.  However,  there  remains  a  need  for  substantial \ninvestment  in  many  sectors  of  the  Kazakhstan  economy  and  there  are  areas  in  which \neconomic performance in the private sector is still constrained by an inadequate business \ninfrastructure. Furthermore, the extent of noncash transactions in the economy and the size of \nthe shadow economy adversely affect implementation of reforms and hamper the efficient \ncollection of taxes. The Government has stated that it intends to address these problems by \nimproving bankruptcy procedures, the business infrastructure, and tax administration as well \nas by continuing the privatization process. Implementation of these measures in the short term \nhas produced few positive results, however, and improved results may not materialize until the \nmedium term, if at all.  \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  13\n \nDEVELOPMENT IMPACT FRAMEWORK \n \n1.
