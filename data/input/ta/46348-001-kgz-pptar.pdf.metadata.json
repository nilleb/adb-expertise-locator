The Toktogul Rehabilitation Project Phase 2 (the Project) aims to further rehabilitate \nToktogul  hydroelectric  power  plant  (HPP)  by  replacing  two  turbine-generator  units  and \nassociated auxiliary systems, and conduct financial audit and corporate governance review of \nthe power sector companies. Ongoing works (Phase1) cover rehabilitation of priority secondary \nmechanical and electrical equipment. The final Phase 3 will cover the remaining two turbine-\ngenerator units and civil structure repairs. A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will \nconduct Project due diligence \n \n2.   The PPTA is necessary due to the Project urgency and complexity. There is a need for \nexpertise from competent international and national consultants to assist the executing agency, \nOpen Joint Stock Company Electric Power Plants (EPP), in preparing the Project. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n3.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n4.  The PPTA is estimated to cost $750,000 equivalent, of which $700,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-V). The detailed cost estimate is presented in Table A4.2.  \n \nTable A4.2: Tentative Cost Estimates \n($\u2019000) \n Item  Total Cost \nAsian Development Banka   \n  1.  Consultants   \n    a.

This amount also includes ADB's administration fee, audit costs, bank charges, and \na provision for foreign exchange fluctuations (if any). \nb  Workshops, training, seminars, and conferences: Stakeholders consultations/training in the Kyrgyz Republic. \n     c  The government contribution will come in the form of counterpart staff, office space and office equipment, \ncommunication facilities for consultants, and other in-kind contributions. The value of government contribution is \nestimated at $50,000.  \n \nD.  Consulting Services \n5.  The PPTA consultant will be a firm. There are 10 positions for international (17 person-\nmonths) and national consultants (18 persons-months). \n ", "       \n6.  It  is  proposed  to  recruit  the  Phase  1  PPTA  consultant  and  the  Phase  1  Project \nImplementation Consultant to be the PPTA consultant for the Project. Single-source selection \nmethod will be used to recruit Fichtner Gmbh & Co. KG of Germany (Fichtner) using ADB grant \nfund of $0.7 million. The justifications for the single-source selection recruitment method are as \nfollows: \n \n(i)  PPTA  for  Phase  1  included  an  assessment  of  future  phases  of  the  overall \nprogram. PPTA for Phases 2 is a natural continuation of Phase 1 PPTA work \nalready carried out by Fichtner.  \n(ii)  Fichtner  is  currently  working  as  Phase  1  project  implementation  consultant.  \nScheduling and scoping of Phases 2 and 3 need to be coordinated with Phase 1 \nwork  to  ensure  no  overlap  of  contractors  working  on  site  and  no  scope \nunder/overlap. A single consultant should prepare the overall program. \n(iii)  The government has requested that the Project be expedited and that advance \ncontracting is undertaken. Bidding documents for the Project should be issued, \nwhile bids for Phase 1 are under evaluation. Separate consulting firms dealing \nwith EPP at the same time will complicate due diligence and implementation.   \n \nTable A4.3: Summary of Consulting Services Requirement \n \nPositions  Person-Months Required \nInternational  17.0 \n \nProject team leader/mechanical engineer  5.0 \nElectrical engineer  3.0 \nMechanical engineer  3.0 \nEconomic expert  1.0 \nFinancial management expert  3.0 \nEnvironmental expert  2.0 \n \nNational  18.0 \n \nDeputy team leader/mechanical engineer  5.0 \nElectrical engineer  5.0 \nEconomic and financial analysis expert  5.0 \nEnvironmental expert  3.0 \n   \nSource:  Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n7.  EPP will be executing agency for the PPTA. An existing project implementation unit at \nEPP will be the project coordinating unit. The consultant will work closely with the project \nimplementation unit.   \n \n8.  EPP will assist the consultants in data gathering, preliminary analysis, and report writing. \nEPP will provide all necessary assistance to the consultants in liaising with other government \nministries  and  agencies.  The  executing  agency  will  provide  and  make  available  to  the \nconsultants, free of charge, the following facilities, services, equipment, materials, documents \nand information as required by the consultants for carrying out the PPTA. \n(i)  counterpart staff/technical support; \n(ii)  office space, sufficient office space for the consultant team, and has national and \ninternational telephone lines, electricity and air conditioning/heating and internet \nconnections; ", "   \n(iii)  office  furniture,  desks,  office  chairs,  book  shelves/cabinets  adequate  to \naccommodate the full complement of international and local consultants; and \n(iv)  organizational support: assistance in all arrangement for workshops, meetings, and \nfield visits and access to required data, maps and other relevant information. \n \n9.
