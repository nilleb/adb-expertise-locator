Weak management of public finances, including imprudent capital expenditure, remains \nat the core of inefficiencies seen in almost all Pacific island countries. Accordingly, supporting \nregional efforts to improve the management of public finances is at the heart of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Pacific Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2004\u20132006.1 \nThe Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) helps Pacific developing member \ncountries (PDMCs) enhance financial and administrative reforms through building capacity, \nproviding policy advice, and offering practical technical assistance (TA) for public financial \nmanagement, tax policy and administration, banking regulation and supervision, and economic \nand financial statistics. The aim of ADB\u2019s Pacific Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program \n2004\u20132006 is to focus on improving public financial management by supporting PFTAC, which \nprovides an efficient and cost-effective way for extending technical support in these critical \nareas. The program includes TA to support PFTAC operations for 2004.2 The TA\u2019s objectives, \nscope, cost estimates and financing, and implementation arrangements were agreed on during \nthe PFTAC tripartite review meeting held in Suva on 5\u20136 August 2004. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The establishment of PFTAC was an outcome of the observation that economic growth \nand development in the Pacific islands were being hampered by a lack of technical skills and \ninstitutional capacity to formulate and implement appropriate economic and financial policies to \nremove  structural  distortions,  increase  efficiency,  and  reduce  macroeconomic  imbalances. \nPFTAC,  located  in  Suva,  the  Fiji  Islands,  is  a  regional  TA  institution  operated  by  the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). It was jointly established in 1993 by the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme and the IMF to implement the Fiscal and Monetary Management \nReform and Statistical Improvement Project in 15 Pacific island developing countries.3 PFTAC \ncurrently operates with financial support from ADB, IMF, and the governments of Australia, \nJapan, and New Zealand. Since 1994, ADB has provided a total of $32 million for six regional \nTAs to support PFTAC operations.4 Five of these six regional TAs were completed and were \nrated as successful, particularly on the grounds of PFTAC being a cost-effective mechanism for \nproviding assistance and ensuring the consistency of advice. \n \n3.  PFTAC\u2019s  aim  is  to  build  skills  and  institutional  capacity  for  effective  economic  and \nfinancial  management  in  Pacific  island  developing  countries  that  can  be  sustained  at  the \nnational level. To this end, by means of responsive and ad hoc help, proactive assistance with \nreforms, and personnel capacity building, PFTAC provides advice and training in four key areas: \n(i) public financial management, (ii) tax administration and policy, (iii) banking sector regulation \nand supervision, and (iv) economic and financial statistics.  PFTAC staff consist of a project \ncoordinator and four resident advisers with expertise in each of the four areas, assisted by \nshort-term consultants as required. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003.

The PFTAC operations that the regional TAs supported were subject to two independent \nevaluations in 1997 and 2004 conducted by panels of experts representing the external funding \nagencies  and  the  countries  involved.5  The  1997  evaluation  concluded  that  PFTAC  was  a \nsuccessful operation. The 2004 evaluation assessed the extent to which PFTAC had achieved \nits objectives and produced its intended outputs, and commented on the relevance of the TA \nand the training provided, its effectiveness in addressing countries\u2019 capacity constraints, and the \nefficiency of the delivery of the TA and training. \n \n5.  The report on the 2004 evaluation was discussed and endorsed at the annual tripartite \nreview meeting held in Suva on 5\u20136 August 2004. The report reiterated that PFTAC has been \nwell executed by IMF and appreciated by other regional bodies, the recipient countries, and the \nexternal funding agencies. It also concluded that PFTAC is well integrated within the region and \nfills a niche that other organizations cannot fill, and that its activities are of high professional \nquality and are timely and appropriate. In addition, the report observed that PFTAC\u2019s reform \ninterventions are most effective when they are fully integrated into a process consisting of a gap \nanalysis, reform strategy, and work plan. The report noted that some external funding agencies \nwould like to see better results in relation to capacity building, but acknowledged that this task \nwould require significant dedicated resources. The report also made recommendations in other \nareas, including TA framework, strategic planning, and performance reporting. \n \n6.  PFTAC's  activities  complement  and  support  ADB\u2019s  operations  in  the  Pacific.  For \ninstance, PFTAC is providing a TA to the economic and public sector reform program in Tonga \nand Tuvalu in the area of tax administration and tax reform, which are important elements of the \nADB-supported program of fiscal and public sector reforms. PFTAC also continues to contribute \nsignificantly to improving financial and economic statistics, which enhances the effectiveness of \nADB's  ongoing  program  in  the  region.6  PFTAC  assistance  complements  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to \nsupport the implementation of a new financial management system in the Fiji Islands and \nenhance good governance in budget preparation across the region.7 PFTAC is also supporting \ninitiatives  to  prevent  money  laundering  and  the  financing  of  terrorism,  including  providing \nassistance  to  the  Cook  Islands  for  verifying  compliance  with  the  anti-money-laundering \nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force. \n \n7.  PFTAC's activities contribute to regional cooperation through regional seminars and \nworkshops.  Its  regional  approach  also  allows  PFTAC  to  actively  assist  in  setting  up  and \nimplementing  regional  and  international  initiatives.  Given  the  commonality  of  many  of  the \nproblems facing the PDMCs, PFTAC's regional approach to TA also allows it to exploit positive \nexternalities.  \n \n8.  PFTAC  has  increased  its  emphasis  on  skill  transfers  to  PDMC  staff  by  means  of \nprofessional attachments and training seminars. It is currently working on a case study of public \nexpenditure management to be used in courses at the University of the South Pacific, including \na possible distance learning training tool for officials. This initiative supports ADB's governance \nactivities and the objectives of ADB's proposed Pacific regional governance strategy. \n \n                                                 \n5  A strategic review of TA for economic and financial management in Pacific island countries was undertaken in 2001 \nto assess the nature and adequacy of current levels and forms of TA, including that provided by PFTAC, to the \nregion and the appropriateness of current arrangements for TA programming and delivery. \n6  ADB. 2002.

The objective of the TA is to continue the provision of ADB support to PFTAC so that the \ncenter  can  continue  to  focus  on  strengthening  and  improving  the  PDMCs\u2019  economic  and \nfinancial  management  capabilities.  PFTAC\u2019s  institutional  strengthening  support  to  improve \nfinancial and administrative reforms through capacity building, policy advice, and practical TA \nwill  help  the  PDMCs  progress  toward  more  effective  and  efficient  economic  and  financial \ngovernance, better public resource allocation, and improved macroeconomic stability. The TA \nframework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Based on PDMCs\u2019 needs and requests in relation to the four key result areas, PFTAC \nwill provide assistance, including policy advice and training, to PDMCs by means of short-term \nvisits by the resident advisers, and regional seminars and workshops. The advisers will also \nprovide timely and effective advice and guidance through direct communications from PFTAC, \nsupplemented by specific, well-defined, short-term consultancies, as necessary. \n \n11.  Overall, the TA supports the following activities: \n \n(i)  providing advice on public financial management, including effective budgeting \npreparation  systems  and  processes,  improved  budget  implementation  and \nmonitoring, and better financial reporting for accountability purposes; \n(ii)  providing activities to strengthen authorities\u2019 capacity to design efficient revenue \nsystems  and  improve  administrative  processes  and  procedures  to  increase \ncompliance;  \n(iii)  assisting with the establishment and effective management of legislative and \nregulatory  systems  for  supervising  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  to \nimprove banking supervision so as to facilitate private sector development; and \n(iv)  strengthening  statistical  systems  and  practices  to  enable  regular  and  timely \ncollection,  compilation,  analysis,  and  dissemination  of  critical  economic  and \nfinancial statistics. \n \n12.  In each of these four key result areas, PFTAC will pursue \n \n(i)  the development and adaptation of tools and techniques that are appropriate to \nthe PDMCs\u2019 needs and limited capacity, and \n(ii)  the provision of on-the-job-training and in-country and regional seminars and \nworkshops to help government officials maintain and enhance their management \ncapability.  \n \n13.  The TA and PFTAC's overall work in the PDMCs complement ADB\u2019s operations in the \nrespective PDMCs. ADB, PFTAC, and other external funding agencies work together closely in \nreviewing needs in the PDMCs and designing assistance programs to complement and support \nactivities in PFTAC\u2019s four key result areas. ADB, along with other external funding agencies, will \nalso  help  PFTAC  and  the  recipient  countries  formulate  strategic  plans  and  implement  the \nrecommendations of the 2004 evaluation.  \n \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of PFTAC's operations for fiscal years 2003\u20132005 is estimated at $5.7 \nmillion equivalent.8  The Government of Japan's contribution amounts to $1.9 million equivalent, \nthe Government of Australia's to $1.1 million equivalent, IMF's to $1.0 million equivalent, and \nthe Government of New Zealand's to $0.4 million. IMF has requested that ADB's aggregate \ncontribution remain at $1.3 million for the 3 years from 2004 through 2006, or $433,000 per \nyear. ADB has agreed to provide financial support to PFTAC on a year-to-year basis, subject to \nan annual tripartite review of performance and the availability of funds. \n \n15.  The  TA  of  $433,000  will  support  PFTAC  operations  for  2004  (January  through \nDecember) and will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The \noverall structure of PFTAC\u2019s financing is carried out through an IMF framework account. The \ndetailed cost estimates and financing plan for PFTAC in 2004 are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  IMF continues to be the executing agency for the TA. All accounting, reporting, and \nauditing procedures are consistent with the provisions set forth in IMF\u2019s overall framework \naccount. PFTAC continues to provide half-yearly reports on its activities and progress to ADB \nand other external funding agencies. PFTAC will consult with ADB and other external funding \nagencies and recipient countries on a strategic plan to implement the recommendations of the \n2004 evaluation and arrangements for workshops, seminars, and training attachments. ADB \nreceives the quarterly work plans of PFTAC advisers for comments and suggestions to ensure \nthat PFTAC's assistance complements and supports ADB's assistance to the PDMCs and to \nassess PFTAC's effectiveness in meeting the PDMCs\u2019 needs. ADB will coordinate closely with \nPFTAC, particularly through ADB\u2019s newly established South Pacific Subregional Office in Suva, \non the activities undertaken in the four key result areas. ADB will also participate in the annual \ntripartite performance reviews organized by the Steering Committee.9 Appendix 3 summarizes \nPFTAC\u2019s activities. \n \n17.  IMF  recruits  and  supports  PFTAC\u2019s  international  resident  advisers  and  short-term \nconsultants in accordance with its standard practices. IMF's selection procedures are consistent \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Selection of Consultants. The international advisers and short-\nterm consultants, partly financed out of ADB's grant, are nationals of ADB member countries \nengaged by the IMF\u2019s Asia and Pacific Department10 after appropriate consultations with ADB. \nADB  funding  will  be  confined  to  benefiting  ADB\u2019s  PDMCs.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Funds under this TA will need to be disbursed before the end of 2004 to reimburse \nPFTAC for expenses incurred during 2004. The TA covers the period January to December \n2004. \n \n \n                                                 \n8 PFTAC's budget is based on IMF\u2019s fiscal year of 1 May through 30 April, while ADB\u2019s contributions are made on a \ncalendar year basis. \n9 The Steering Committee comprises representatives from external funding agencies and recipient countries and \nsupports and advises PFTAC between annual performance reviews. \n10  In coordination with other pertinent IMF departments. \n ", "  5\nIV.

Public Financial Management Adviser \n \n1.  The adviser\u2019s overall objective is to help Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) \nimprove their authorities\u2019 capacity to effectively control and efficiently manage public finances, \nincluding domestic and external public debt. To that end, assistance by the adviser will help \nPDMCs strengthen their budgetary, cash management, and accounting systems on the basis of \nwell-defined strategic plans. In particular, improvements will be sought in budget planning and \npreparation;  budget  execution  and  monitoring;  and  auditing  and  evaluation  of  public \nexpenditure, including, where appropriate, expenditures by government entities and enterprises \nand extrabudgetary funds. The adviser will encourage PDMCs to adopt or improve the use of \nsuch modern budgetary tools as program-oriented budget systems that can be sustained at the \nnational level. In addition, the adviser will provide assistance with establishing or strengthening \neffective  treasury  and  cash  management  systems  and  accounting  practices  that  can  help \ncontrol expenditure and rationalize and streamline budget financing. Finally, the adviser will \nseek to improve the transparency of budget processes and public expenditure and strengthen \nthe accountability of ministries and officials by promoting key principles of the International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency. \n \nB.  Tax Policy and Administration Adviser \n \n2.  The adviser\u2019s overall objective is to help PDMCs strengthen their authorities\u2019 capacity to \nenhance the economic and administrative efficiency of domestic revenue systems and increase \ntheir yield. In particular, the adviser will help the authorities formulate and implement policy \nreforms and improvements in tax and customs administration. This will include assistance with \nthe redesign of revenue systems that becomes necessary as a result of international and \nregional trade policy initiatives, such as World Trade Organization rounds and the Pacific Island \nCountries Trade Agreement, but will also include reforms intended to streamline and simplify \nexisting regimes, increase their efficiency, and broaden tax bases, for example, in the case of a \ngeneral value added tax, where this is feasible. In the area of revenue administration, the \nadviser will concentrate on providing assistance in improving administrative processes and \nprocedures,  and  increasing  compliance  by  strengthening  collection,  auditing,  and  taxpayer \nservice  functions.  The  involvement  of  and  consultation  with  stakeholders  within  the \nadministration and outside will be emphasized in advance of reforms. \n \nC.  Banking Regulation and Supervision Adviser \n \n3.  The adviser\u2019s overall objective is to help the authorities establish and effectively manage \nlegislative and regulatory systems for the supervision of banks and other financial institutions \nthat meet high international standards, and support sound banking practices and financial sector \nstability.
