INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  ongoing  global  financial  and  economic  crisis  has  halted  the  robust  growth \ndeveloping Asian economies enjoyed until 2007. The rapid deterioration in industrial countries\u2019 \neconomic  growth  resulting  from  the  current global  economic  and  financial crisis  has  been \ntranslated into weaker economic prospects for developing Asia, which remains heavily reliant on \nexternal  demand  as  its  engine  of  growth.  The  global  downturn  has  adversely  affected \ndeveloping  Asia's  exports  (particularly  to  industrial  countries)  and  has  reduced  regional \ndomestic demand because of reductions in incomes. In addition, the financial sectors in some \nregional economies have seen increases in capital outflows, weaker remittances, and shrinking \ndollar-denominated funding. Regional growth declined in 2008 from the nearly 2-decade peak \nachieved in 2007 and is expected to be clipped further in 2009. As a result, more than 60 million \npeople will remain trapped in poverty than would have been the case if previously high growth \nrates had continued. This research and development technical assistance (TA) aims to provide \nappropriate policy prescriptions to allow Asia to return to its high long-term growth trajectory and \ncontinue its fight against poverty. \n2.  The severity of the current turmoil has led to assistance and research efforts by the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank, and the Group of 20 (G20). They \nhave undertaken programs and projects to respond swiftly to the crisis and to address the \nadverse effects of the global downturn on their member economies.  \n3.  Within  ADB,  research  in  the  regional  and  knowledge  departments  is  focused  on \nidentifying the impacts of the crisis on the region, and on providing the necessary assistance for \nADB's developing member countries (DMCs) so they can cope with the global slowdown. Thus, \nthe TA envisages close collaboration between the Economics and Research Department (ERD), \nthe other knowledge departments, and the regional departments, particularly in terms of the \nstudy's focus and its implementation arrangements. The TA design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Sustainable growth. Before the global crisis that began in 2008, Asia had experienced  \nyears of rapid growth. However, this growth has been mainly driven by massive demand for \nAsia's exports from outside the region and a collapse in demand for the region's exports has  \nadversely affected Asia's economic growth. Nevertheless, Asia is poised to lead the global \neconomic recovery, as regional governments and central banks have undertaken effective fiscal \nstimulus measures and easier monetary policies. Asia now faces the challenge of being the \nworld's engine of growth and recovery. In the transition to full recovery, demand from industrial \ncountries is likely to continue declining. In this situation, the short-term issue is how Asia can \nincrease domestic demand to sustain its growth. In the long term, there is a need to implement \nsupply-side  structural  policies  to  improve  the  productivity  of  investments  and  enhance \ntechnological progress. \n5.  Rebalance growth. For Asia to be the world's engine of growth and recovery, it must \nreduce its reliance on extra-regional demand. The region must strive to diversify its sources of \ngrowth. Strengthening domestic demand is imperative. In particular, this involves encouraging \nconsumption by reducing the precautionary motive for savings among households. In the short \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 September 2009. \n ", "2   \nterm, raising consumption can boost growth. However, enhancing the investment climate and \npromoting  small-  and  medium-sized  enterprises  and  service  industries  will  also  bolster \nproduction from firms that cater to domestic demand. In the long term, it is important to focus \nmore on investment because, in addition to the initial boost to growth that it provides, it also \ncontributes  to  capital  accumulation,  leading  to  more  productive  activities,  and  generating \nadditional growth in succeeding years. However, there are several key questions. How can Asia \nuse its comparative advantage for its development? What are the industries where Asia has \ncomparative advantage? What should be the role of government? Should government target \nindustries or should it just improve the investment climate? \n6.  Broaden openness. Asia must broaden its openness to foreign trade and capital flows. \nSince the region has suffered from the adverse consequences of overreliance on extra demand \nfor its exports from outside the region, it must expand its internal markets, particularly for final \ngoods.  While  trade  within  Asia  has  been  gradually  increasing,  this  growth  has  been \nconcentrated  on  parts  and  components  that  support  regional  production  networks. \nStrengthening intraregional trade in final goods will help reduce Asia's overdependence on \nindustrial countries. However, how can Asia strengthen its trade in final goods rather than in \nparts and components? How can it strengthen intraregional investment that supports regional \nproduction networks catering to intraregional demand? Asia still needs to improve its domestic \ninstitutional capacity to ensure that shifts in capital flows are less destabilizing to its economies. \nThis primarily involves encouraging a shift toward longer-term capital inflows such as direct \ninvestments by improving the investment climate.  \n7.  Regional cooperation and integration. In its efforts to rebalance growth and broaden \nopenness, Asia must adopt policies to enhance regional cooperation. Reducing border barriers \nto intraregional trade can speed up the process of trade integration among regional economies. \nSpeeding  up  the  realization  of  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  will  allow  the  region  to \nsuccessfully tap and mobilize its large savings pool for investment. The Chiang Mai Initiative will \nact as an insurance mechanism, making a $120 billion regional foreign reserve pool available \nfor countries in the region needing financing.2  \n8.  This  TA  proposes  to  deepen  and  extend  understanding  of  the  long-term  growth \nprospects of developing Asia, taking into account the effects of the ongoing financial and \neconomic crisis. In particular, it will examine, through a careful review of trends and alternative \nscenarios, and through the use of sensitivity analysis, how a move from export-oriented growth \nto domestic-demand-driven growth can effectively include more consumption and investment, \nenhanced social development and social safety nets, and stronger regional cooperation. The \nmethodology for specific analyses will be finalized during the inception workshop. \n                                                 \n2  In response to the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis, the finance ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) agreed to promote the \nChiang Mai Initiative (CMI). The goal of CMI is to address short-term liquidity problems and supplement existing \ninternational financial arrangements. In February 2009, the ASEAN+3 agreed to increase the fund from $80 million \nto $120 billion. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will support a study that will look at the medium- and long-term impacts of the \nglobal crisis on developing Asian economies through a reassessment of an export-led growth \nstrategy, and comparing it with a domestic-demand-led growth strategy and a more balanced \ngrowth  strategy.  It  will  develop  policy  recommendations  for  the  inclusive  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of the developing Asian region. \n10.  The impact of the TA will be to generate effective policy advice that will allow developing \nAsian economies to rebalance their growth. This will be measured by an evaluation of whether \nthe economic policies and development strategies adopted by ADB strike a balance between \nthe contributions of domestic and external demand to economic growth. The TA will support an \nextensive  analysis  of  how  the  ongoing  global  crisis  will  change  the  global  financial  and \neconomic landscape. Economic policies and development strategies to achieve inclusive and \nsustainable development will need to take this changed environment into consideration.  \n11.  The  objective  of  the  TA  will  be  to  improve  countries'  understanding  of  which \ndevelopment strategies and policies are most effective in minimizing extreme business cycle \nfluctuations and achieving inclusive and sustained economic growth. Options for alternative \ndevelopment strategies and policies will be made available to policy makers and practitioners so \nthey may make an informed assessment of which among the various alternative development \nstrategies would be relevant for their economies. The study will provide strategies not only for \nnational development, but also for regional cooperation and integration. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The study will take stock of previous and ongoing work by ADB and other multilateral \nand  research  organizations  on  the  medium-  and  long-term  impacts  of  the  ongoing  global \nfinancial and economic crisis on developing Asia. In undertaking this review, ERD will work \nclosely  with  other  knowledge  departments  and  all  regional  departments.  The  study  will \nundertake a reassessment of the export-led growth strategy and an evaluation of the main \nalternative growth strategies (a domestic-demand-led growth strategy and a more balanced \ngrowth strategy) for developing Asia. This reassessment and evaluation may be carried out in \npartnership  with  the  ADB  Institute,  research  institutions  and  universities,  and  well-known \ninternational scholars. These scholars are expected to produce five background papers that will \nbe used as inputs for the TA final report.  \n13.  An inception workshop, a midterm review workshop, and a finalization conference will be \norganized. These workshops may be cosponsored with other organizations undertaking related \nresearch. The inception workshop will be organized in month 4 to discuss the crisis impacts and \nidentify the key challenges facing the region. The midterm review workshop will be organized in \nmonth  7  to  discuss  evaluations  of  the  alternative  growth  strategies.  Representatives  from \ngovernments and regional groupings (such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the \nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, as well as ADB programs on the Greater \nMekong Subregion, South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation, and Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation) will be invited during the midterm review meeting to encourage policy \ndiscussion  and  dialogue  at  an  early  stage.  National  and/or  regional  consultations  with \nstakeholders (e.g., policy makers and civil society organizations) may also be held to extend the \nstudy's reach in ADB's DMCs.   \n ", "4   \n14.  Based  on  the  evaluation  of  growth  strategies,  the  study  will  identify  policy \nrecommendations  that  will  contribute  to  the  inclusive  and  sustainable  development  of \ndeveloping Asian economies. The recommendations will not be limited to national policies, but \nwill include policies for regional cooperation and integration. The finalization conference will be \nheld in month 10 to disseminate the study's findings and to advocate for the adoption of policies \nto support inclusive and sustainable growth. \n15.  The TA final report will be drafted in months 11-12 and published as a book by month \n16. The draft outline of the final report is in Appendix 2. The book's executive summary will be \npublished separately. The book will be disseminated in months 17-18 through a variety of \noutreach activities. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB's funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund-IV). Details of \nthe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be managed by ERD. The TA is \nexpected to be carried out over 18 months, from December 2009 to May 2011. All outputs will \nbe subject to interdepartmental review and to external review during the workshops or the \nfinalization conference. \n18.  The TA will require 16 person-months of international consulting services, 24 person-\nmonths of national consulting services, and 1.4 person-months of resource persons' services. \nThe  consultants  to  be  engaged  include  macroeconomists,  an  economics  editor,  a  copy \neditor/typesetter, a project manager, and a secretary. The consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). All consultants will be selected on an individual basis. Coordination and administrative \nsupport will be carried out by ERD. The terms of reference for consultants and resource persons \nare  in  Appendix  4.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook3. \n19.  The TA report will be drafted by the project team and the international consultants. The \nlead consultant will be responsible for drafting the overview. The other chapters will be prepared \nby the rest of the consultants. The economics editor and copy editor/typesetter will ensure that \nthe publication is of high quality and adheres to ADB style. A project manager and secretary will \nbe hired to facilitate implementation of the TA. Resource persons will be engaged to serve as \ndiscussants during the workshops and to provide comments on the background papers. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.
