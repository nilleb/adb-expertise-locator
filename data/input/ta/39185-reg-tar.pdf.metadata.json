The  2005  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) includes a regional TA to undertake analytical work on issues \nrelated to the management of the cities in Asia.1 Knowledge in this area is highly demanded by \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) and extremely  relevant to  ADB\u2019s current and future \noperations.2 Thus, this TA responds to both DMCs\u2019 demands and ADB\u2019s operational needs. The \nTA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Cities in Asia are experiencing rapid population growth, which is putting further pressure \non their already overstretched infrastructure and degraded environment. The population in the \ncities of Asia is growing at about twice the rate of the total population. By 2030, the proportion of \npopulation living in the cities is projected to rise from its current level of about one third to one \nhalf of Asia\u2019s total population. The rate, scale, and pace of growth of cities throughout the region \nand their impacts on economic, social, and environmental conditions have emerged as a major \nissue in the region. Effectively managing the cities of all sizes poses a major development \nchallenge for DMCs.  \n \n3.  Some key problems of the cities relate to transport management, energy use, water \nsupply and sanitation, environmental management, slum and squatter settlements, and land \nmanagement. The productivity, business activities, competitiveness, and energy efficiency of \nthe cities is constrained by inadequate transport infrastructure and the resultant congestion. The \nmajority of cities in the DMCs contend with serious air pollution that reflects the existing modes \nof transport and patterns of energy use. Lack of adequate water supply and sanitation is \nreflected in higher household and business costs and adverse environmental impacts. Poor \nenvironmental conditions in these cities seriously affect the health of the inhabitants and people \nin neighboring areas. The economic impacts of urban pollution in terms of productivity losses \nand health costs have been estimated at 1\u20135% of gross domestic product (GDP). About one \nthird of the total population lives in informal settlements with limited access to basic services. \nSome 20% of the population in Asian cities is poor, and large numbers of these people live in \nslums or as squatters. The infrastructure deficiencies are most severe in those slums and \nsquatter settlements. Rising populations in these cities increasingly press on the limited land \nresource, which adversely affects household and business costs.  \n \n4.  There is a close correlation between higher incomes and degree of urbanization. Cities \nin the DMCs account for a sizable proportion of GDP in those countries and serve as the \ncenters of growth and innovation. The cities in the region are highly critical for these economies, \nand their efficiency and productivity have a strong bearing on the economic prospects of the \nDMCs. Thus, management of the cities and their development to meet the future demands are \nimportant issues for growth, sustainability, and achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  \n \n5.  Asian cities of all sizes face major infrastructure and service delivery challenges, which \nrequire mobilizing sizable resources. The ongoing work to review ADB\u2019s urban sector strategy \nsuggests that the urban infrastructure in Asia will need investments of about $250 billion per \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 21 November 2005. \n2  DMC demand for knowledge in this area was also reflected in the Strategy and Policy Department\u2019s DMC \nconsultations relating to partnership framework with middle-income/ordinary capital resources countries.  \n ", "2   \nannum for the next 25 years. How to finance these huge requirements is a key issue facing the \ncities in the region.  \n \n6.  At the same time, the governance and financial health of the municipal bodies remain \nweak. That hampers their fulfilling new mandates handed to them as a result of increasing \ndecentralization in the region. Over more than a decade, there has been growing recognition of \nthe need to (i) improve the governance and capacity of municipalities, (ii) strengthen their \nfinancial management,3 (iii) promote private sector participation (frequently in partnership with \nthe public sector) in delivering urban infrastructure and services, and (iv) use new technology \nand  innovate  project  designs  to  address  in  a  financially  sustainable  manner  the  array  of \nchallenges facing these cities. Furthermore, while the general awareness of key policy and \nregulatory  issues  has  been  growing,  to  translate  ideas  into  practice  has  remained  a  real \nproblem for cities in the region. Operational knowledge of relevant techniques and know-how to \nimplement some generally agreed ideas seem to be inadequate. \n \n7.  Although significant efforts have been made in the aforementioned areas, examples of \nsuccess  have  been  few.  Based  on  past  performance,  two  factors  stand  out  as  the  main \nstumbling blocks in the management and development of cities. First, the governance, capacity, \nand financial health of the municipalities have remained weak. This undermines their ability to \nadequately and efficiently provide the required infrastructure and services in the rapidly growing \ncities. Transfers from central or provincial governments continue to be the main funding sources \nfor municipal bodies, for example, while their abilities to raise their own resources or secure \ndebt  financing  have  been  inadequate.  Improving  their  governance,  capacity,  and  financial \nmanagement, as well as their abilities to mobilize resources are key issues. Secondly, like all \nother infrastructure, past efforts to generate private sector participation and sustainability in \nfinancing urban infrastructure and services delivery have generally fallen short of expectations.  \n \n8.  Asia is the fastest growing and most dynamic region in the world, and this is reflected in \nthe increasing complexity of the challenges facing the cities. These cut across various sectors \nand themes. The existing operational knowledge in DMCs and other stakeholders in this area \ncontinues to be weak. There is increasing demand by DMCs for knowledge and assistance from \nADB in these areas. A recent study, Connecting East Asia, undertaken jointly by ADB and \nothers, has also highlighted the need for new ways of thinking about such infrastructure issues \nas subsidies, competition, regulation, roles of the public and private sectors, and local capital \nmarkets.4 These issues are highly relevant in the urban context and call for fresh examination. \nDMCs  are  seeking  from  ADB  the  latest  knowledge,  innovative  solutions,  and  cutting-edge \ntechnology to address these issues. Most of ADB\u2019s past analytical work related to cities or urban \ndevelopment was done in the 1990s and is now quite dated. Moreover, under its innovation and \nefficiency initiative, ADB proposes to increase its work with subsovereign entities and to target \nnew business areas, many of which are in the region\u2019s cities.    \n \n9.  In view of the above, there is an urgent need to undertake an integrated analysis of the \nissues related to management of cities while focusing on some key operational areas. While the \nanalytical  work  should  cover  the  subject  comprehensively,  it  should  focus  on  municipal \nmanagement and such operationally relevant areas as urban transport, energy, water supply \n                                                 \n3 Recently, ADB introduced new financing instruments that include lending to the municipalities without sovereign \nguarantee. Thus, financial health and credit ratings of municipalities in the region have become relevant to ADB \noperations.  \n4  ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and World Bank. 2005.

This work needs to be undertaken in partnership with regional \nexperts and organizations to find solutions that are specifically relevant and applicable to Asia.  \n \n10.  This  analytical  work  will  improve  ADB\u2019s  knowledge  in  the  management  of  urban \nagglomerations and help it respond more effectively to DMCs\u2019 rapidly expanding needs in this \narea. Further, this will support implementation of ADB\u2019s forthcoming urban sector strategy, \nparticularly in respect to the operational aspects. In the context of new financing modalities and \ninstruments, this work will also facilitate identifying new areas for ADB operational support and \nbusiness development. The analytical work is consistent with ADB\u2019s current strategic thrust, \nwhich emphasizes relevance, responsiveness, and results. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will undertake integrated analytical work aiming to improve the management of \ncities of all sizes in the DMCs. It will cover the emerging medium- to long-term trends and \nissues, as well as successful regional and global experiences, and suggest approaches for the \nfuture in the Asian context. It will improve operational knowledge and understanding in an area \nof high demand from DMCs and well place ADB to respond effectively to their needs. The TA \nwill also improve ADB\u2019s partnership with related experts and institutions in the region and \ndemonstrate  ADB\u2019s  character  as  a  regional  knowledge  organization.  The  findings  will  be \ncompiled as a knowledge product of high operational utility and widely disseminated for use by \nthe DMCs.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA activities will include (i) a broad analysis of the cities in the region, along with \nrelevant data to cover the key trends, issues and challenges; (ii) a summary and analysis of \nregional and international good practices and new innovative approaches;5 (iii) research and \nanalysis to suggest future directions in the Asian context; and (iv) a compilation of key regional \ndata related to this subject. While the TA will cover policy and institutional issues, it will focus on \noperational aspects. The TA will focus more on \u201chow\u201d than \u201cwhat\u201d to do, and it will delve deeper \ninto project design and financing aspects. The work will focus on (i) governance, capacity and \nfinancial  management  in  the  municipalities,  and  (ii)  delivery  of  the  key  infrastructure  and \nservices in a financially and environmentally sustainable manner to make these cities more \nlivable and productive. In particular, it will focus on areas related to ADB\u2019s current and potential \noperations, such as energy, transport, water, and environment. In the context of economic \ngrowth, which is considered the most important requirement for poverty reduction, the TA will \nmoreover address some key issues related to the efficiency and productivity of the cities.  \n \n13.  The analysis related to management of municipalities will cover legal and institutional \nstructure,  capacity,  governance,  resource  base,  financial  management,  access  to  capital \nmarkets, debt financing and credit rating issues. It will also examine innovative but tested ways \nof augmenting municipal revenues and leveraging market funds. Special attention will be paid to \nlegal and institutional arrangements for engaging in partnership with the private sector. The \nanalysis will also examine appropriate modalities for ADB to extend direct loans and guarantees \nto municipalities in the region.  \n \n                                                 \n5  This will include experiences of both developing and developed countries.  \n ", "4   \n14.  Regarding infrastructure and service delivery, the TA will focus on design, technology, \nand management aspects of projects, along with appropriate financing options. The analysis will \ncover regional and global experiences that could be applied in the Asian context and identify or \ndevelop  replicable  solutions.  Special  attention  will  be  paid  to  financial  and  environmental \nsustainability, as well as to the perspectives of utility operators and institutional lenders. In the \nprocess,  the  TA  will  focus  on  the  latest  technology,  know-how,  new  project  designs,  and \nfinancial innovations based on the various successful and innovative approaches tried across \nthe globe in a range of settings. Based on research and analysis of international and regional \ngood practices, the TA will identify suitable approaches and methodologies, as well as establish \nbenchmarks, where applicable, for different categories of cities in the region. The latter will be \nbased on such common parameters as per capita income, legal and institutional settings, and \nsocioeconomic conditions. The work will include to identify commonalities and variations. The \nTA will identify workable solutions while avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions.  \n \n15.  The TA will build upon all such recent and related ADB work as the innovation and \nefficiency initiative, energy efficiency initiative, and ongoing work of the special initiatives group \nin RSDD. It will coordinate with related ongoing or planned activities in ADB, including the \nforthcoming urban sector strategy, the international conference on investing in Asia\u2019s urban \nfuture scheduled for February 2006, the clean air initiative, and others. To ensure the relevance \nand applicability of its findings while capturing cutting-edge knowledge, the TA will strive for \nclose involvement of selected regional and global experts and institutions of high standing. This \nwill  also  facilitate  dissemination  of  the  findings.  Further,  apart  from  policymakers  and \ndevelopment practitioners in the DMCs, the analytical work will closely involve institutional \nlenders and utility operators in order to fully capture the operational perspective.      \n \n16.  The findings of the analytical work under the TA will enhance ADB\u2019s ability to engage \nmore  effectively  with  the  DMCs  in  policy  dialogue  and  in  delivering  lending  and  technical \nassistance in some key areas of ADB operations. Further, since the analytical work will cover \nsuccessful regional and global experiences while suggesting possible future directions suitable \nfor the Asian context, the TA will contribute to improving the management in cities of all sizes in \nthe region by benefiting DMC policymakers and development practitioners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $980,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The TA cost estimate and financing plan is shown in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  with  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) as the nodal department for its implementation. RSDD will \nundertake  the  TA  activities  in  collaboration  with  other  relevant  departments.  The  TA \nimplementation team will comprise a team leader in RSDD and selected staff drawn from across \nADB. It is expected that the team will form subgroups and divide responsibility for the analytical \nwork across the relevant sectors and themes. The team and its subgroups will be supported by \ninternational and domestic consultancy expertise. An advisory group of four regional and global \nexperts of high standing will support the detailed design and analysis, and review the findings of \nthis project from inception to completion intermittently. Overall supervision and guidance will be \nprovided by a task force chaired by RSDD, comprising representatives of the departments ", "  5\nconcerned,  and  reporting  to  the  Management  through  the  Vice-President  Knowledge \nManagement and Sustainable Development.  \n \n19.  Implementing the TA will require about 15 person-months of international individual \nconsultants, including urban and infrastructure experts in energy, transport, water supply and \nsanitation, environment, and municipal management. Two of those person-months will be for a \nsubject expert editor and a copy editor. Implementation will also require about 50 person-\nmonths of individual domestic consultants to provide quality support to research and data \nanalysis.  In  addition,  implementation  will  involve  several  technical  studies  and  specialized \nanalytical inputs (some of an academic nature, others more applied) from a range of external \nexperts. Preferably, these experts will be from the region. These additional experts will be \nengaged  as  resource  persons,  which  approach  is  considered  proper  in  that  the  activities \ninvolved  will  be  of  short  duration.  Moreover, the  TA  implementation  team  will  commission \ntechnical or field studies on a selective basis. The engagement periods of consultants and \nresource persons with various skills will be refined and finalized in consultation with the advisory \ngroup during the TA inception. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its \nguidelines  on  using  consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the \nengagement of domestic consultants.6 \n \n20.  The TA implementation team will closely collaborate and regularly consult with relevant  \ncommunities of practice and networks of ADB. As will be appropriate, the team will organize \nfocused discussions, workshops, and seminars. The outputs of this analytical work will be \ncompiled as a knowledge product of high operational utility. The findings of this analytical work \nwill  be  widely  disseminated  through  various  modalities,  including  publication,  seminars, \nworkshops, and conferences. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, starting in January \n2006 and ending in June 2007. The TA\u2019s outcome should be evaluated with a view toward \nADB\u2019s policy dialogue with DMCs, demand for ADB\u2019s assistance, and developments in DMCs \nrelated to the management of cities in the region.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $980,000 on a grant basis for \nManaging the Cities in Asia, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

General \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  require  inputs  from  international  and  domestic \nconsultants  and  resource  persons  drawn  from  a  range  of  experts,  institutions,  and \norganizations.  These  will  include  individual  consultants,  consulting  firms,  research \norganizations, government, and the private sector to provide both analytical and operationally \nrelevant inputs. The consultants and resource persons will include urban and infrastructure \nexperts  in  the  areas  of  energy,  transport,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  environment,  and \nmunicipal  management.  The  domestic  consultants  will  provide  technical  and  research \nassistance support to the TA implementation team and should have strong backgrounds and \nexperience in data collection, data analysis, and analytical research in the above areas. The \nconsultants and resource persons will ensure general consistency across the various chapters, \nincluding theoretical consistency in the analysis and suggestions emerging from the analytical \nwork. The detailed terms of reference for the consultants and resource persons with different \nskills and their engagement periods will be finalized in consultation with the advisory group \nduring inception of the TA. \nB.  Consultants and Resource Persons \n1.  Urban and Infrastructure Consultants (international, 13 person-months)    \n2.  The  overall  task  of  the  urban  and  infrastructure  consultants  will  be  to  undertake \ntheoretically  sound  analytical  work  to  prepare  an  operationally  relevant  and  Asia-focused \nknowledge product covering the latest modalities and innovative solutions, particularly in the \nareas  of  energy,  transport,  water  supply  and  sanitation,  environment,  and  municipal \nmanagement. This will involve a review of existing literature, including the ongoing work within \nand  outside  ADB,  collection  of  data,  analysis  of  trends  and  issues,  identification  of  good \npractices and innovative approaches, and suggestions for the future in the Asian context. The \ngeneral approach will be to analyze the existing situation and trends in the region, as well as to \nanalyze the experiences of other developing and developed countries to draw lessons from their \nsuccessful experience and capture the latest knowledge. The analysis will carefully examine \nwhat international experiences are relevant for the region, given its socioeconomic conditions \nand the overall economic setting.  \n3.  In terms of specific tasks, the consultants will prepare an overall picture of the cities in \nAsia, including their economic structure, policy and institutional arrangements, infrastructure, \nenvironment,  poverty  scenario,  and  management  of  municipalities.  In  this  context,  the \nconsultants will also examine and assess the current and future contribution of cities to the total \ngross domestic product (GDP) of these countries, the role of cities as growth centers, and the \nrequirements to improve or maintain their efficiency and productivity. Moreover, the consultant \nwill cover intercity and interregional relationships including urban-rural-subregional linkages.   \n \n4.  For  each  of  the  identified  areas\u2014including  energy,  transport,  water  supply  and \nsanitation, and environment\u2014the consultants will analyze the existing Asian situation, including \nbroad  growth  trends;  policy  and  institutional  arrangements;  technology  and  management \npractices;  shares  of  public  and  private  sector  participation;  modalities  of  private  sector \nparticipation; constraints, efficiency and cost-effectiveness of various modalities; cost recovery \nand  affordability  (where  applicable);  resource  mobilization,  financing;  regulation  and \nenforcement; integration with land use planning; role of civil society; effectiveness of present \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \narrangements; and issues for consideration. The analysis will also compare Asia with other \nregions, including the developed world, on key items that include technology, design, and \nfinancing modalities. Further, the consultants will examine the areas and methodologies of \nexisting public-private partnership across the globe in various settings. In this process, the \nanalysis  should  identify  the  latest  successful  and  cutting-edge  technologies,  new  project \ndesigns, and financial innovations tried across the globe. Options should be examined to deliver \nand/or maintain these facilities and services in a financially viable manner. The task will include \nanalysis of what works and what does not, including the reasons why and why not, and to \nidentify workable solutions for the future. Special attention will be given to sustainability of the \nlocal and global environment by examining various options, including mass transit systems, \nenvironmentally friendly technologies, energy use, demand-side management of energy use, \ninnovative solid and wastewater management, as well as affordability and financial viability of \nthese options. Based on this analysis, the consultants will identify suitable approaches and \nmethodologies and establish benchmarks, where applicable, for different categories of cities in \nthe region. The latter will be based on such common parameters as per capita income, legal \nand institutional settings, and socioeconomic conditions.
