The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) requested project preparatory technical \nassistance (PPTA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for preparing the Strengthening \nWater Management and Irrigation Systems Rehabilitation Project.1 The project is to help the \nGovernment increase the number of engineers with qualifications in agriculture-related water \nmanagement,  improve  the  governance  and  management  of  irrigation  systems,  increase \nagricultural production, and improve the productivity of project areas to increase the incomes of \npoor farmers.2 The PPTA fact-finding mission was conducted during 31 March to 17 April 2008, \nand culminated with the Government\u2019s concurrence with the PPTA impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In recent years Viet Nam has achieved remarkable economic growth. The Government\u2019s \n5-year  socioeconomic  development  plan  for  2006\u20132010  aims  to  promote  sustainable \ndevelopment, and increase quality and efficiency of growth. Planned outcomes related to the \nwater sector include (i) increased agricultural production to meet needs for food security and \nexports;  (ii)  improved  crop  productivity,  quality,  and  processing  of  high-value  products; \n(iii) development of aquaculture; and (iv) reduced vulnerability to the impacts of floods and \ndroughts. The Government is concerned with the sustainability of the country\u2019s water resources \nas reflected in the national water resources strategy,3 where the main objectives for the water \nsector in the next 15 years are defined as the protection, efficient exploitation, and sustainable \ndevelopment  of  water  resources  on  the  basis  of  integrated  and  unified  water  resources \nmanagement.4  \n \n3.  Several external development partners provide assistance for the development of the \nwater sector in Viet Nam. In addition to ADB these include the World Bank; United Nations \nChildren\u2019s  Fund  (UNICEF);  and  the  governments  of  Australia  (Australian  Agency  for \nInternational Development), Belgium, Denmark (Danish International Development Agency), \nFrance (Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement), Italy (Directorate General for Development \nCooperation\u2014Ministry of Foreign Affairs), Japan (Japan International Cooperation Agency and \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation), the Netherlands, and the United States (United \nStates Agency for International Development). Most international assistance reflects a strong \ndevelopment focus with an emphasis on works and measures, with very little investment in \nareas of water management. However, ADB is currently facilitating the process from the side of \nexternal agencies in an ongoing joint development partner and Government initiative for a \ncomprehensive water sector review,5 which aims to help the sector agencies concerned adopt \n                                                 \n1  The PPTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 19 May 2008. \n2   The project is the merger of two former pipeline projects: (i) water resources management (sector), which appears \nin the Viet Nam country strategy and program (2007\u20132010); and (ii) rehabilitation of irrigation systems, which \nappears in the Viet Nam country operational business plan (2008\u20132010). The merger came about with delays in \nprocessing the former, and to achieve higher efficiency in project preparation and implementation, as well as to \nprovide stronger rationale and greater chance of achieving success in strengthening water management. \n3  ADB. 2000.

It is also intended to provide a common framework to guide development decisions in \nthe water resources sector over the coming 10 years. The water sector review presents a dire \nwater resources situation given ever-increasing demands due to the country\u2019s population and \neconomic growth. These demands on available water resources have already placed \u201cmoderate \nstress\u201d on 6 of the 16 major river basins in the country, with 4 of these deemed to be \u201chighly \nstressed.\u201d6 Unless  an  integrated  approach  to  efficient  management  of  water  resources  is \nadopted, the situation will deteriorate in the future resulting in more reliance on groundwater to \nsupply its needs. This would cause major environmental impacts that cannot be fully determined. \nAn integrated approach is also needed for coastal and riparian zone land-use planning as \nclimate change and sea level rise will increase the incidence and severity of water-related \nnatural disasters.7 The results of the water sector review, which are due by August 2008, will \nalso be used to inform the design of the project and mobilize resources for the water sector. \n \n4.  While  the  proportional  contribution  of  the  agriculture  sector  to  the  gross  domestic \nproduct  has  declined,  the  sector  remains  an important  source  of livelihood  and  means  of \npoverty reduction for a significant proportion of the population. Irrigated agriculture provides the \nbulk of Viet Nam\u2019s employment and is by far the largest user of water, exceeding 65,500 million \ncubic meters per year (more than 82% of the total estimated water use in Viet Nam). Paddy rice \nis the dominant crop, accounting for more than 80% of the total irrigated area. Water resources \nhave been extensively developed to support the growth of agriculture and the country has about \n100 large- and medium-scale hydraulic works systems. One of the oldest and largest is the Bac \nHung Hai irrigation and drainage system located to the east of Ha Noi in the Red-Thai Binh \nRiver Basin, which was designed and constructed in 1959. The total physical area of the system \nis 192,045 hectares, of which 146,756 hectares (76.4% of total area) are used for agricultural \npurposes,  mainly  to  grow  paddy  rice.  The  total  population  of  the  provinces  and  districts \nencompassed by the command area is about 2.7 million, of whom about 2.2 million are working \nin agriculture. Given its importance to the economy, social welfare, and food security, and its \nadvanced state of disrepair, the rehabilitation of the Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage \nsystem is one of the Government\u2019s top investment priorities. \n \n5.  The strategic focus of the country strategy and program for Viet Nam (2007\u20132010)8 is to \nsupport business-led, pro-poor, and sustainable economic growth. It takes a results-based \napproach that is directly linked to supporting the targeted outcomes of the socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan. Weak public administration and poor governance of state-owned enterprises \nare key constraints to the mobilization and efficiency of public investments, which hinder the \neffective delivery of public services. Viet Nam has 110 irrigation and drainage management \ncompanies (IDMCs), employing more than 22,500. Three of these are state-owned enterprises \nunder the direct control of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD), including \nthe Bac Hung Hai IDMC. Local participation through participatory irrigation management and \nwater-user groups is vital to ensure service quality and the efficient use of water resources in \nirrigation schemes. Participatory irrigation management pilots have demonstrated significant \n                                                 \n6  The international standard for \u201cwater exploitation stress\u201d is that moderate stress begins with a value of 20% (if \nmore than 20% of the water basin discharge is extracted), and high water stress occurs for values above 40%. The \nhighly stressed river basins are the Ma, Huong, Dong Nai and southeast river cluster in Khanh Hoa, Ninh Binh, \nBinh Thuan, and Ba Ria-Vung Tau provinces. The Red-Thai Binh River Basin is moderately stressed. \n7  Viet Nam ranks among the top five most impacted countries to climate change and fourth in the world behind the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, India, and Bangladesh in terms of the absolute number of people living in vulnerable, \nlow elevation coastal zones. In the 10 years to 2006, natural disasters in Viet Nam caused nearly 5,000 deaths, \nand destroyed more than 6,000 fishing boats, nearly 300,000 houses, and 3.9 million hectares of paddy rice. \n8  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2007\u20132010): Viet Nam. Manila. \n ", "  3\nimprovements in the effectiveness of water management. However, its application has been \nslow for reasons concerning governance at all levels and deficiencies in water users\u2019 awareness \nand abilities. A possible approach being considered for improved management of irrigation \nsystems is the mapping systems and services for canal operation techniques (MASSCOTE),9 \nwhich  is  a  methodology  for  the  modernization  of  canal  irrigation  systems  and  improving \nperformance of conjunctive water supplies for multiple stakeholders. With high economic growth \nin nonagriculture sectors, demands on available water resources and proposals for reallocations \nare increasing. To ensure a minimum of disruption to agricultural production, the quality of \nirrigation and drainage services and the efficiency of irrigation systems must be improved. \n \n6.  ADB has engaged development partners and the Government to provide technical and \nfinancial assistance for improved water management and irrigation, along with several relevant \nongoing projects.10 One of the main lessons from these interventions is that strengthening \ncapacity to develop the water resources sector is crucial for the success of future investments. \nOne effective means of strengthening capacity is through the provision of qualified human \nresources for development and management of water resources, including for irrigation.  \n \n7.  Water Resources University (WRU) with its main campus in Ha Noi is the only university \nthat educates water engineers in Viet Nam. Operating for more than 50 years, it has trained \nmore than 18,000 engineers in water-related fields, of which more than 80% continued to work \nin their chosen professions. However, the situation at WRU has stagnated with the training \nprogram,  teaching  methodology,  and  reference  materials  lacking  needed  innovations.  The \ncurriculum is outdated, and the subjects taught are not fully diversified, including a lack of \ncourses related to water, sanitation, and public health. The current training methods still focus \non theory with little practical skills development, and the existing physical facilities cannot meet \nthe  requirements  for  high-quality  human  resources  training  and  development.  With  rapid \neconomic growth in Viet Nam, the demand for water engineers is growing by 4% per annum. If \nWRU is to remain the sole source of supply for this increased demand it will need to more than \ndouble its enrollment. Currently, 9,500 students are attending WRU training programs, yet due \nto inadequate facilities at the main campus in Ha Noi, about half of these students attend in-\nservice training in the provinces, where the quality of training cannot be assured. While WRU\u2019s \nstrategic development plan11 includes the training of 20,000 water engineers by 2020, it will not \nbe able to achieve this target unless its physical facilities and capacity are improved.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 2007.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  PPTA  impact  and  project  outcome  are  strengthened  quality  of  water-related \nservices.  This  will  contribute  to  the  project  impact\u2014sustainable  management  of  water \nresources. The PPTA outcome is the project design agreed by the Government and ADB. The \ninitial poverty and social analysis for the project is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The PPTA will provide the detailed design for three main components: (i) strengthening \ncapacity of water-related service providers, (ii) improving management of irrigation and drainage \nsystems,  and  (iii)  constructing  new  infrastructure  and  upgrading  existing  irrigation  systems \ninfrastructure. \n \n10.  The component for strengthening capacity of water-related service providers will support \nupgrading of the professional training facilities for water resources specialists at WRU. The \nproject will provide funding and technical assistance to support improved education for water \nsector  professionals  and  technicians,  stronger  water  sector  research  and  development \nprograms, and education facilities with equipment to enable an increase in the number of \nqualified engineers in water-related fields needed to meet the heightened demands of a rapidly \ngrowing economy.12 This component will be designed in a participatory manner in collaboration \nwith  WRU  staff  and  students,  and  other  stakeholders  to  identify  priority  institutional  and \ninfrastructure requirements.  \n \n11.  The component for improved management of irrigation and drainage systems would \nsupport the Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage system by providing funding to upgrade \ncrucial components and technical assistance to modernize management of the system. This \ncomponent will be designed in a participatory manner in collaboration with farmers, IDMCs, and \nother  stakeholders  to  identify  the  priorities  needed  for  improved  delivery  of  irrigation  and \ndrainage services. Following the mapping systems and services for canal operation techniques \n(MASSCOTE) approach, a step-by-step analysis leading to a consolidated vision of the future of \nthe Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage system and a plan for progressive modernization of its \nirrigation management and canal operations will be formulated.  \n \n12.  The component for construction of new infrastructure and upgrading of existing irrigation \nsystems infrastructure for the Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage system will be designed in a \nparticipatory manner with Bac Hung Hai IDMC, farmers, and other stakeholders to identify \npriority investments needed to rehabilitate the Bac Hung Hai irrigation system, as well as \npossible new infrastructure development. This will culminate with the design of an investment \nproject  that  incorporates  selection  principles  and  strategies  developed  under  the  first  two \ncomponents.13  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,250,000 equivalent, of which ADB will \nprovide $1,000,000. The PPTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, \n                                                 \n12  Project implementation capacity of executing agency staff may also be strengthened through attending WRU \ncourses for degrees or capacity improvements. \n13  Feasibility studies will be conducted in accordance with the common general guidelines on feasibility study \npreparation for official development assistance projects funded by the five banks (Decision No: 48/2008/QD-TTg \nissued on 3 April 2008 by the Prime Minister). \n ", "  5\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $250,000 \nequivalent through counterpart staff, office space, administrative services, and physical facilities. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MARD, the Executing Agency for the PPTA, will establish a new project management \nunit headed by a project director with full delegated responsibility for decision making. The unit \nwill comprise full-time qualified and experienced staff of WRU and Bac Hung Hai IDMC, along \nwith specialized technical staff resources. The project management unit will (i) provide day-to-\nday guidance to the PPTA consultants; (ii) liaise with participating ministries and departments of \nMARD, WRU, and Bac Hung Hai IDMC; (iii) assist the PPTA consultants in carrying out their \nduties efficiently and effectively; and (iv) implement the project. \n \n15.  The PPTA is expected to commence in November 2008 and be completed by July 2009. \nNo major items of equipment will be procured. Minor equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). The equipment will \nbe handed over to MARD upon completion of the PPTA. A team of international (29 person-\nmonths) and national consultants (46 person-months) will implement the PPTA. Implementation \nwill  require  specialists  with  expertise  in  water  resources  development;  tertiary  education; \nagricultural and resource economics; financial analysis and financial management assessment; \ncivil  and  hydraulic  structures  engineering;  and  environmental,  social  resettlement,  and \nparticipatory  approaches.  ADB  will  engage  a  firm  of  consultants  in  accordance  with  the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method with a ratio of 90:10 (technical score: financial score) applied \nfor  the  evaluation,  which  is  to  be based  on  full  technical  proposals.  The  outline  terms  of \nreference for the consultants is in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The PPTA will organize stakeholder workshops to disseminate outputs; obtain feedback \nand views; refine project proposals; and ensure close liaison with key national, regional, and \nprovincial stakeholders as appropriate. Tripartite review meetings involving the Government, the \nconsultant team, and ADB will be organized at critical milestone events. The consultants will \nprepare (i) an inception report, including a detailed work plan, to be submitted within 1.5 months \nof PPTA commencement and to be discussed at the initial tripartite review meeting; (ii) a \nmidterm report to present preliminary findings, to be submitted within 5.5 months of PPTA \ncommencement and to be discussed during the interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft final \nreport, to be submitted within 7 months of PPTA commencement, to present the salient features \nof the project, including technical, financial, economic, legal, institutional, social, environmental, \nand other aspects following the ADB format for the report and recommendation of the President \nfor loan processing; and (iv) a final report, addressing the Government\u2019s, ADB\u2019s, and other \nstakeholders\u2019 comments on the draft final report, within 1 month of presentation of the draft final \nreport  at  a  national  workshop.  At  least  15  copies  of  each  report  will  be  provided  to  the \nGovernment. Key outputs of the PPTA will be translated into Vietnamese as required.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the Strengthening Water Management and Irrigation \nSystems Rehabilitation Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nQuality of water- Number of engineers  Government statistics  Strong political commitment \nrelated services  with qualifications in  and annual reports of  to  \nstrengthened  agriculture-related  IDMCs  \u2022 integrating management \nwater management    of water resources \nincreased  ADB project completion  \u2022 improving public \n  report  administration and \nIncrease in number of    governance of IDMCs \nIDMCs equitized   ADB sector evaluation  \u2022 supporting financial \n  studies  autonomy for IDMCs \nIncreased number of    \u2022 sustainable operation and \nhectares in the project  ADB country assistance  maintenance of public \narea irrigated or  and program evaluation  investments \ndrained leading to   \n\u2022 effective interagency \nincrease in agricultural \nsupport and cooperation \nproduction and \nRisks (external) \nproductivity \n\u2022 Rapidly increasing prices \nchange economic \nsituation and production \npatterns \n\u2022 Adverse global climate \nchanges \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  \u2022  Adequate counterpart \nagreed to by the  understanding defining  understanding  support \nGovernment and  project scope and    \u2022  Adequate and timely \nADB  implementation  provision of data \narrangements agreed  \u2022  Adequate sharing of \nand signed by the  knowledge and \nGovernment and ADB  information \nduring appraisal  \u2022 Adequate performance of \nmission in July 2009  consultants \nRisks (internal) \n\u2022 Government refuses to \nimplement resolutions of \npolicy dialogue. \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector \nanalysis describe how the project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it \nis linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the partner country. \n \nIn recent years Viet Nam has achieved remarkable economic growth. While the proportional contribution of \nthe agriculture sector to the gross domestic product has declined, the sector remains an important source \nof livelihood and means of poverty reduction for a significant proportion of the population. With continued \neconomic growth in other sectors, demands for water and proposals for reallocations will increase. Thus \nimprovements of the quality of irrigation and drainage services, and efficiency of irrigation systems, are \nurgently needed to enable a minimum of disruption to agricultural production. \n  \nThe Government\u2019s 5-year socioeconomic development plan for 2006\u20132010 aims to promote sustainable \ndevelopment and increased quality and efficiency of growth. Planned outcomes related to the water sector \ninclude increased agriculture sector production to meet needs for food security and exports; improved crop \nproductivity, quality, and processing of high-value products; development of aquaculture; and investment \nin water resources infrastructure (including irrigation) to support growth and to reduce the impact of floods \nand droughts. \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program for Viet Nam (2007\u20132010) takes a \nresults-based approach that is directly linked to supporting the targeted outcomes of the socioeconomic \ndevelopment plan. Weak public administration and poor governance of state-owned enterprises are key \nconstraints to mobilizing and increasing the efficiency of public investments, which hinder the effective \ndelivery of public services. ADB\u2019s strategic focus for supporting business-led, pro-poor, and sustainable \neconomic growth includes interventions designed to address these constraints. The specific targets for the \nensuing project to be designed under the project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) are to increase \nthe  number  of  engineers  with  qualifications  in  agriculture-related  water  management,  improve  the \ngovernance  and  management  of  irrigation  systems,  increase  agricultural  production,  and  improve \nproductivity of project areas to increase the incomes of farmer beneficiaries. \n \nB.  Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs \n(TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.  Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nThe classification is based on the main outputs of the proposed project: (i) strengthened capacity for \nwater-related services delivery in the country through construction of a new campus and curriculum \ndevelopment for Water Resources University (WRU); (ii) improved management of irrigation and drainage \nmanagement companies; and (iii) upgraded Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage system to improve the \nlivelihoods and increase incomes for 2.7 million people. Interventions will be applied to address issues \nrelating to participation, gender, and empowerment under the project. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1. If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is \nneeded?      N/A \n \n2. What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence?  \nInternational social specialist: 3 person-months; national social specialist: 4 person-months; national on-\nfarm water management specialist: 3 person-months; and national gender specialist: 2 person-months. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross \nsubsidy, pro-poor governance, and pro-poor growth)?  \nThe  project  does  have  scope  for  a  pro-poor  design.  Participation  of  the  poor,  women,  and \ndisadvantaged groups through participatory irrigation management and extension services are proposed \nas measures to ensure social inclusion by stakeholders. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially \nexcluded benefit from the project?  \n \nThe project is expected to have 2.7 million primary beneficiaries, of whom 2.2 million are farmers in the \nfour provinces comprising the command area of the Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage system. These \nfarmers often suffer the effects of drought and water logging. The new WRU campus will provide better \nconditions for students and teachers for study and research. An increase in the number of qualified \ngraduates will contribute to the improvement of irrigation services and water management in general. \nThe new campus with provide improved accommodation and sanitation, which will benefit poor students, \nespecially females. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \n \nThe need for improved irrigation and drainage infrastructure, water management, and environment \nprotection is growing. Rapid economic growth in Viet Nam has spurred a greatly increased demand for \nwater engineers. Too few water engineers work in the districts and skilled water technicians are needed \nin the communes. With the improved facilities of the proposed new campus, more students can be \nenrolled, and ultimately more qualified engineers will be available to meet the demand. With new subject \nareas relating to public health and sanitation, the needs of beneficiaries, particularly women and \nchildren, will be addressed. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will \nthe project address them?  \n \nPotential constraints for poor farmers who have small plots of land, and those who are located at the end \nof  the  canal  may  not  have  a  voice  in  water  allocation.  To  avoid  this,  the  project  is  to  promote \nparticipatory water management with representatives of different groups of beneficiaries and civil society \norganizations. Poor farmers will have access to extension services through district extension centers. \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.  \n \nThe Department of Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Central \nProject Office, WRU, irrigation and drainage management companies, local authorities, nongovernment \nand civil society organizations (women\u2019s unions, youth unions, farmer associations). \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing \n(e.g.,  workshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernment  organizations  and \ncommunity-based organizations, etc.)?  \n \nWorkshop consultation will be organized during the PPTA and project processing. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         \nEmpowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nDuring  fact-finding  for  the  PPTA,  ADB  started  stakeholder  consultations  with  intended  project \nbeneficiaries including WRU and Bac Hung Hai irrigation and drainage management company. Further \nintensive consultations are planned during project preparation. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1. What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this \nproject/program?  \n \nThe project has potential gender issues that will be addressed. The majority of agricultural workers are \nwomen; they are impacted most by drought as their workload increases with the need to manually water \ncrops. Women are also the victims of waterborne diseases due to unsafe working conditions and direct \ncontact with polluted water. Female students enrolled at WRU are underrepresented (around 30% of \ntotal student numbers). The existing teaching methods, programs, and curriculum are not attractive to \nfemale students. With the new campus, and improved facilities and curriculum to be provided, more \nfemales are expected to be admitted to the university. \n \n2. Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s \nempowerment by improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, \nassets, and participation in decision making?        Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nA gender action plan will be prepared during the PPTA. \n \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender \ninequality?       \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nThe project will have no adverse impacts on women or widen gender inequality due to the protective \nmeasures and actions in the gender action plan. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \n \nIII.
