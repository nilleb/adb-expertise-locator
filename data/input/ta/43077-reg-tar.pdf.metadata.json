INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program strives to create \nan integrated, harmonious, and prosperous subregion. This vision is being pursued through a \n\"3Cs\" strategy of enhancing connectivity, improving competitiveness, and promoting a greater \nsense of community. To implement this strategy, the GMS countries have adopted an economic \ncorridor approach. Under this approach, the GMS countries will expand key transport corridors \nwithin the GMS to boost economic activity and link the subregion with major markets in East and \nSoutheast  Asia.  Nodal  points  within  these  corridors  will  serve  as  the  primary  centers  for \nbusiness development. The North\u2212South Economic Corridor (NSEC) has been designated as a \nflagship program. The Third GMS Summit, held in Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic \nin  March  2008,  called  for  enhanced  efforts  to  transform  transport  corridors  into  economic \ncorridors. During the summit, GMS ministers signed a memorandum of understanding pledging \nto work together to develop economic corridors in the subregion. An NSEC Strategy and Action \nPlan1 was formulated subsequently, and endorsed by the Fifteenth GMS Ministerial Meeting \nheld in Cha-Am, Thailand, on 19 June 2009. One of the key recommendations of the NSEC \nStrategy and Action Plan was the creation of cross-border economic zones (CBEZs) along the \ncorridor. \n \n2.  This  regional  policy  and  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  is  designed  to \nsupport the implementation of the NSEC Strategy and Action Plan by developing CBEZs along \nthe border between the People's Republic of China (PRC) and Viet Nam, specifically at two \nborder crossing points: Hekou\u2013Lao Kai and Pingxiang\u2013Dong Dang. Periodic consultations were \nconducted with the PRC's and Viet Nam's GMS national focal points to determine the impact, \noutcome, outputs, and implementation arrangements for the TA project, in particular during the \nGMS Special Senior Officials' Meeting and the Task Force Meeting for the GMS Economic \nCorridors Forum held in March 2009 in Kunming, Yunnan Province, PRC. A fact-finding mission \nwas also fielded to the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi) of the PRC in August \n2009 to seek the views of the local authorities, particularly those in the border areas. Broad \nagreement was reached on key aspects of the TA project, and support was obtained for its \ndesign and implementation. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC and Viet Nam are active participants in various regional cooperation and \nintegration initiatives, including the GMS Economic Cooperation Program. Both countries have \nembraced the principles of, and demonstrated strong commitment to, regional cooperation. The \nPRC Country Partnership Strategy 2008\u201320103 identified regional cooperation as one of the \nfour thrusts of ADB assistance, whereby ADB's regional cooperation and integration programs \nwill  be  used  to  enhance  infrastructure  connectivity  and  facilitate  cross-border  trade  and \ninvestment.  Regional  cooperation  is  also  a  cross-cutting  theme  in  the  Viet  Nam  Country \nStrategy and Program 2007\u20132010,4 and is regarded as an important means of reducing poverty \nand sustaining economic growth by promoting competition and encouraging cross-border trade \nand investment. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2009. Toward Sustainable and Balanced Development: A Strategy and Action Plan for the GMS North\u2212South \n  Economic Corridor. \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 6 May 2009.  \n3 ADB. 2008.

The  governments  of  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam,  under  the  broader  framework  of \ncooperation between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the PRC,5 have \nlaunched  a  \"Two  Corridors  and  One  Circle\"6 initiative  to  encourage  economic  cooperation \nbetween  the  two  countries.  The  physical  orientation  and  the  strategic  objectives  of  the \nKunming\u2013Hai Phong and Nanning\u2013Hai Phong corridors under the initiative match those of the \nNSEC.7 More recently, the two governments reached consensus on jointly establishing CBEZs \nin the PRC's Yunnan Province and Guangxi, and in Viet Nam's Lao Cai and Lang Son provinces. \nMoreover, the PRC and Viet Nam have ratified the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement \n(CBTA) and its annexes and protocols. To implement the CBTA, the two governments have \nexpanded  the  scope  of  their  bilateral  transport  agreement.  The  border  crossing  points  at \nHekou\u2013Lao  Cai  and  Pingxiang\u2013Dong  Dang  were  included  in  the  scope  of  the  pilot \nimplementation of the CBTA at the Third GMS Summit. They are all located in the CBEZs along \nthe NSEC. \n \n5.  Developing economic corridors entails concerted efforts in the areas of transport, trade \nfacilitation, and investment. It requires improvements in physical infrastructure and an enabling \npolicy  environment  that  will  generate  additional  economic  activity.  Investments  to  improve \nphysical  connectivity  must  be  complemented  by  efforts  to  facilitate  transport,  trade,  and \ninvestment\u2014particularly within the framework of the CBTA and the GMS Strategic Framework \nfor Action on Trade Facilitation and Investment (SFA-TFI).  \n \n6.  It is also critically important to identify and address the weakest links in the corridors. \nOne  common  finding  from  various  studies  on  GMS  transport  and  economic  corridor \ndevelopment\u2014including the latest study on the NSEC Strategy and Action Plan\u2014is that the \nweakest links in economic corridors tend to be at the border. Nodal points within corridors, \nparticularly key border cities or towns, have  strategic importance as centers for economic \nactivity,  including  business  development,  trade  expansion,  and  investment.  However,  the \ndevelopment of most of border crossing points, including those in the NSEC, is still constrained \nin  terms  of  both  physical  infrastructure  and  the  policy  environment.  This  situation,  if  not \naddressed, will prevent the NSEC from realizing its full potential.  \n \n7.  While the physical connectivity within the NSEC has been improved as a result of major \ninvestments  in  road  infrastructure  in  recent  years,  problems  still  remain  in  some  areas, \nespecially at border points where the physical facilities are still substandard. For example, the \nphysical layout of the common control area at the border and the related processing facilities do \nnot meet the needs of single-window or single-stop inspection schemes. Border control facilities \nlack  modern  information  technology  and  communication  equipment.  In  PRC-based  and \nespecially Viet Nam-based sections of the NSEC, the logistics infrastructure remains insufficient, \nleading to relatively high logistics costs in terms of money, time, and reliability. This discourages \ntraders and investors from using the NSEC. \n \n8.  The policy environment for the NSEC also needs improvement. Despite repeated calls \nfor accelerated implementation of the CBTA by GMS ministers and leaders, pilot implementation \nalong the NSEC has been delayed or stalled for a variety of reasons. Multi-step, redundant, and \n                                                 \n5 The  full implementation  of the  ASEAN\u2013PRC  Free Trade  Agreement  will start  in  January 2010 and will generate \n   tremendous opportunities for trade and investment cooperation between the PRC and Viet Nam. \n6 The initiative, announced in 2004 by the two countries' top leadership, seeks to facilitate trade and investment along \n   the  two transport  corridors  from the  PRC's  Kunming  to Viet Nam's  Hai Phong  via Ha Noi and  from  the  PRC's \n   Nanning to Hai Phong  also via Ha Noi, and  to build an economic circle along the  Beibu Gulf. Commitments to this \n   goal were reiterated during the subsequent ASEAN\u2013PRC summits and the PRC\u2013Viet Nam summit meetings. \n7 NSEC consists  of  three  subroutes: (i) the  Kunming\u2013Chiang Rai\u2013Bangkok  route  via the Lao People's Democratic \n  Republic, (ii) the Kunming\u2013Ha Noi\u2013Hai Phong route, and (iii) the Nanning\u2013Ha Noi route. \n ", "  3\ngenerally uncoordinated procedures for processing of goods, vehicles, and people by various \nagencies remain the norm at most border checkpoints. The cost of delayed implementation is \nhigh. A recent analysis shows that in the NSEC, border crossing and transit fees account for \n60% of the trade cost, while border crossing time is about 15% of total corridor time.  \n \n9.  Capacity  constraints  also  exist.  Implementing  the  CBTA  and  developing  the  NSEC \nrequire the participation of various stakeholders\u2014not only central governments, but also local \ngovernment agencies and private sector players. However, local government officials and local \nentrepreneurs, particularly those in border areas, lack sufficient awareness, knowledge, and \nskills in transport, trade, and investment facilitation. This has hindered the growth of trade and \ninvestment in the NSEC. \n \n10.  There  are  also  institutional  constraints.  Coordination  among  transport,  trade,  and \ninvestment agencies at the central and local level is weak. Cross-border coordination at the \nlocal and border level is even weaker. Local authorities and communities need to be more \ninvolved in NSEC development. Institutional arrangements should be put in place to coordinate \nand sustain cross-border initiatives along the NSEC. \n \n11.  Private sector participation in NSEC development remains limited because of many \nfactors, particularly: (i) lack of information for private sector on NSEC, CBTA, and SFA-TFI \ninitiatives; (ii) inadequate investment in cross-border trade logistics facilities and services; (iii) \npoor access to financing, particularly for cross-border investments; and (iv) the absence of a \nforum for dialogue between the public and private sector stakeholders. These constraints must \nbe addressed to improve the environment for cross-border trade and business development.  \n \n12.   Promoting  cross-border  investment  is  critically  important  to  transforming  transport \ncorridors into true economic corridors. However, investment cooperation along the NSEC has \nbeen poor. Few concrete initiatives with definite outputs have been implemented. The Fifteenth \nGMS Ministerial Meeting discussed steps to address this deficiency. The meeting identified \npromotion of cross-border investments and border-area investments along key GMS corridors \nas a priority. \n \n13.   The Third GMS Summit endorsed a comprehensive approach to integrating initiatives in \nthe areas of transport, trade facilitation, and investment. The Fifteenth GMS Ministerial Meeting \ncalled for \"quick wins\". This TA is designed to address the constraints identified above by \nfocusing on developing CBEZs at the two aforementioned important border crossing points \nalong the NSEC.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of this TA is the establishment and effective management of the CBEZs in \nthe border provinces of the PRC and Viet Nam, contributing to the development of the NSEC \nunder the GMS Economic Cooperation Program. \n \n15.  The TA outcome will be the effective functioning of PRC\u2013Viet Nam CBEZs. The key \nmeasurable results, expected by the end of 2011, include the drawing up of a master plan for \nand  key  investment  plans  in  the  Hekou\u2013Lao  Kai  and  Pingxiang\u2013Dong  Dang  CBEZs, \nstrengthened human and institutional capacity for CBEZ management in the PRC and Viet Nam, \nand stronger private sector participation in CBEZ development. \n \n ", "4  \n16.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs:  \n \n(i)  establishment  of  the  PRC\u2013Viet  Nam  joint  committee,  and  subcommittees  if \ndeemed  necessary,  for  developing  and  managing  the  Hekou\u2013Lao  Kai  and \nPingxiang\u2013Dong Dang CBEZs;  \n(ii)  formulation of a CBEZ master plan as well as key investment plans in priority \nsectors;  \n(iii)  improvements in the environment for cross-border business development in the \nCBEZs; \n(iv)  enhanced capacity of the PRC and Viet Nam government agencies in CBEZ \ndevelopment and management;  \n(v)  enhanced  private  sector  participation  and  strengthened  public\u2013private \npartnership (PPP) in the development of CBEZs;  and \n(vi)  lessons learned about CBEZ development disseminated among GMS countries \nand elsewhere. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The TA will undertake the following activities: \n \n(i)  organizing  conferences  and  consultations  to  help  the  PRC  and  Viet  Nam \nestablish a joint committee, and subcommittees if necessary, for developing and \nmanaging the CBEZs;  \n(ii)  conducting studies and organizing workshops to help the two countries formulate \na master plan for the joint development of CBEZs and key investment plans in \npriority sectors in a coordinated manner; \n(iii)  conducting studies and workshops to recommend policy measures to decision \nmakers,  particularly  those  responsible  for  trade  facilitation  and  investment \npromotion  in  the  border  provinces,  for  improving  the  environment  for  cross-\nborder business development in the CBEZs, including streamlined cross-border \nprocedures, enhanced access to financial services for enterprises, and timely \nprovision of business and investment information; \n(iv)  conducting  training  and  capacity  building  activities,  including  workshops  and \nstudy tours, to enhance the capacity of the PRC and Viet Nam government \nagencies, particularly those at the provincial and border levels, in developing and \nmanaging the CBEZs; and \n(v)  organizing  public\u2013private  sector  dialogues  and  business  forums  to  address \nprivate sector needs and develop PPP opportunities, particularly in the areas of \nimproving trade logistics services and border crossing facilities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000 equivalent, of which $800,000 equivalent will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional \nCooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility. 8  The  central  and  provincial \ngovernments of the PRC and Viet Nam will each make in-kind contributions of about $50,000 \nequivalent  by  providing  counterpart  staff;  office  space;  support  for  training,  seminars,  and \nconferences; and other administrative and logistical services. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n8 Established by ADB. \n ", "  5\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  A total of 12 person-months of international and 13 person-months of national consultant \nservices will be required to provide advisory and technical services under the TA project. The \nconsultants and resource persons will be specialists in the areas of integrated transport, trade, \nand investment facilitation; development planning and strategy formulation; private sector and \nbusiness development; and institutional and capacity building. Because the TA project will \ninvolve varied activities, consultants and resource persons will be selected and engaged by \nADB as individuals based on their qualifications and experience in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The outline terms \nof reference for consultants and resource persons are in Appendix 3. Office equipment will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to \ntime), and will be transferred to implementing agencies upon completion of the TA project. The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.9  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 27 months, from October 2009 to December 2011. \nADB will be the Executing Agency. The implementing agency in the PRC will be the Ministry of \nCommerce  supported  by  the  Department  of  Commerce  in  Yunnan  and  Guangxi.  The \nimplementing agency in Viet Nam will be the Ministry of Planning and Investment supported by \nthe Provincial People's Committee in Lang Son and Lao Cai provinces. Other government \nagencies,  including  those  responsible  for  transport,  customs,  and  other  border-crossing \nactivities, will also be involved. Private sector entities in the two countries, particularly in the \nborder  provinces  concerned,  will  be  actively  engaged.  The  Financial  Sector,  Public \nManagement and Regional Cooperation Division of ADB's East Asia Department will administer \nand implement the TA project in close collaboration with ADB's Southeast Asia Department and \nthe resident missions in the PRC and Viet Nam. Special attention will be paid to collaboration \nbetween this TA project and GMS corridor and border town development projects and transport \nprojects in Yunnan, Guangxi, and northern Viet Nam that are ongoing or under preparation. \nLessons learned from those projects will be applied in the implementation of this TA project. \nEfforts  will  also  be  made  to  strengthen  partnership  with  other  international  organizations, \nparticularly the United Nations Development  Programme (UNDP), to ensure a coordinated \napproach to CBEZ development. The monitoring of implementation progress and outcome will \nbe carried out through periodic reviews in accordance with the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n21.  The TA project outputs, particularly the findings and recommendations from the key \nstudies, will be disseminated through workshops, seminars, conferences, publications, and the \nmedia. Where appropriate, representatives of the secretariats of other regional cooperation \nbodies will be invited to dissemination events.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nDeveloping Cross-Border Economic Zones between the People's Republic of China and Viet \nNam, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2008.
