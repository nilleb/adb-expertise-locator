INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Common Agenda for the Modernization of Sanitary \nand Phytosanitary Measures for Trade Facilitation by (i) creating national bodies in each country \nand a regional body to lead the modernization process; (ii) developing regulations, procedures, \nand requirements that are aligned with international standards; and (iii) improving the capability \nof border agencies to implement these measures at selected common borders.1  \n \n2.  The TA supports the national priorities of CAREC countries as described in their country \npartnership strategies. They aim for economic growth through diversification and competitiveness, \nwith strategies to develop agriculture-based value chains and improve quality through better \nservices  that  incorporate  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  (SPS)  measures.  Regional  SPS \nmodernization also forms part of the CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020, \ncontributing to the overall CAREC 2020 strategic objectives of expanded trade and improved \ncompetitiveness.2 It further supports the longer-term objectives of CAREC 2030 such as to \npromote regional trade in agriculture through alignment of SPS measures with international \nstandards, build capacity on product quality and diversity, and improve shipment linkages.3 The \nTA  puts  into  effect  the  CAREC  SPS  Common  Agenda  to  upgrade  SPS  measures  and \ncomplement customs-related and trade-facilitating initiatives.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A number of regional and global agri-food trends underscore the need to devote serious \nattention  to  agriculture  in  CAREC  countries.  First,  income  and  consumption  demand  are \nincreasing faster than agri-food production growth in the region. For instance, annual gross \ndomestic product growth averaged 6.9% in 2006\u20132015 and consumption expenditure per capita \naveraged 6.1%; while agriculture value added grew only at 4.2%.5 With the increase in income \ncomes demand for quality and safe food. Second, while the agriculture sector contributed an \naverage of 15% to gross domestic product in 2015, this is a drop from the 2006 share of 19%, \nwith 9 of the 11 countries experiencing such contraction. The sector continues to engage one-\nthird to one-half of the total workforce.6 Third, local demand is increasingly being met by imports. \nRelative to agriculture production, exports fell from 24% to 21% while imports rose from 36% to \n42%.7 Yet agriculture exports are a larger proportion of total exports (22%) than agriculture \nimports are of total imports (14%). Available data shows the main exports to be commodity crops \nsuch as cotton, wheat, barley, fruit and vegetables, and corn. Pasture-based livestock production \nalso predominates, yet trade in meat products appears to be limited.  \n                                                \n1  The CAREC SPS Common Agenda, which was adopted by CAREC countries in 2015, will (i) promote concerted \nreforms and modernization in the implementation of SPS measures consistent with international standards in ways \nthat facilitate safe trade within and outside the region, and (ii) identify and prioritize investment needs to modernize \nSPS measures and their implementation. \n2  ADB. 2014. CAREC Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy 2020. Manila  \n3  ADB. 2017. CAREC 2030 Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development. Manila  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 May 2017.  \n5  Data for gross domestic product growth and agriculture value added are based on 10 countries (Afghanistan, \nAzerbaijan,  People's  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  Georgia,  Kazakhstan,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mongolia,  Pakistan, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan), while consumption expenditure data is based on seven countries (Azerbaijan, PRC, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan). \n6  Data for seven countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan). \n7  Data for eight countries (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and \nTurkmenistan). \n \n ", "2 \n \n4.  Agri-food  demand  is  increasing  globally  because  of  growing  populations,  more \nurbanization, and rising incomes. Patterns of food consumption are changing toward more \nlivestock products, vegetable oil, and sugar. Thus, CAREC has great potential for expanding trade \nin agricultural and food products, which will in turn spur more production and diversification. This \npotential cannot be realized if animal and plant health is poor or food is unsafe. Quality is \nparticularly critical for agri-food products to reach markets abroad, since trade is conditional on \nguarantees of freedom from pests and diseases. SPS measures must be effective and efficient \nin mitigating the risk of foodborne disease and the vulnerability of agriculture to pests, diseases, \nand hazardous substances that increased trade brings. \n \n5.  An initial assessment of CAREC SPS systems in 2012 revealed (i) the continued use of \nGOST,8 which is complex and not aligned with the World Trade Organization (WTO) SPS \nAgreement or international standards; (ii) the absence of risk-based analysis, and (iii) inefficient \nSPS controls at border points. A more detailed assessment in 2015 confirmed the following: \n(i) existing plant pests are not known because of limited expertise in pest risk analysis, regulations \non plant health are absent; animal diseases and zoonoses listed by the World Organisation for \nAnimal Health (OIE) that affect trade are endemic in the region, GOST and nationally developed \nstandards are still used; hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) is not mandatory, \nregulations for primary production and processing are prescriptive, and final-product testing uses \nprescriptive product standards rather than risk-based inspection;9 (ii) there is limited or no basic \nlaboratory capacity to provide protection against quarantine pests, detect and identify viruses and \nphytoplasmas, implement full surveillance and testing for OIE-listed diseases, or analyze the \nentire series of chemical contaminants or pathogenic bacteria; moreover, chemical contaminant \nparameters are not harmonized with international standards, Codex standards for sampling \nprocedures are not applied, and food safety parameters are inappropriate; and (iii) SPS border \nmanagement lacks a system of risk assessment for plant products, or the capacity to prevent the \nintroduction  of  animal  diseases,  zoonotic  diseases,  or  microbiologically  or  chemically \ncontaminated products of animal origin; efficiency of border veterinary control is hindered by \ntechnical deficiencies, lack of infrastructure and personnel; thus, there are overlapping and \nexcessive inspections and delays.  \n \n6.  There are no coordinated or comprehensive national SPS strategies, resulting in ad hoc \ninterventions  and  incoherent  institutional  arrangements.  SPS  issues  and  their  economic \nsignificance are not fully appreciated; hence, SPS services are not a priority and are under-\nresourced, resulting in the inability to provide adequate protection. Numerous bilateral and \nmultilateral agreements provide a framework for cooperation on SPS issues, but these have only \nbeen declaratory rather than effective, and no lead country could foster the process and push for \ncoherence and regional cooperation. \n \n7.  The CAREC SPS Common Agenda recognizes the need to revamp CAREC countries\u2019 \nSPS systems in a concerted manner in view of their similarity in agro-ecosystems, products, and \n                                                \n8  GOST = gosudarstvennyy standart (state standard). Originally developed by the former Soviet Union as part of its \nnational standardization strategy, GOST is now being administered by the Euroasian Interstate Council for \nStandardization,  Metrology  and  Certification.  With  more  than  20,000  titles  used  extensively  for  conformity \nassessment and as regulatory bases for certification programs in the CIS, GOST is prescriptive, mandatory, and \ninflexible in responding to new health risks or consumer demand. \n9  GOST provides end-product certification, which is at variance with the process-based HACCP. Provided in the Codex \nAlimentarius, HACCP is an internationally recognized system used to identify and manage significant food safety \nhazards and ensure food safety, and can be used throughout all stages of the food chain. \n \n ", "3 \nagricultural practices. The common agenda seeks compliance with the WTO SPS Agreement, \nwhich provides principles and rules that enable countries to maintain SPS measures while \nensuring  they  do  not  impede  trade.  The  agreement  prescribes  the  standards  of  the  OIE, \nInternational Plant Protection Convention (IPPC), and Codex Alimentarius Commission for food \nsafety. A best-practice SPS system supports sustainable, resource-efficient, and secure agri-food \nproduction and consumption. Currently, eight CAREC countries are members of WTO.10 Four \ncountries have formally included SPS Agreement principles in their primary legislations; however, \nthe requirements and practices are still not fully harmonized with SPS standards.11 The rest are \neither new, observers, or preparing for accession, thus their SPS regulations have yet to be \naligned with the agreement.12  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) trade expanded and competitiveness \nimproved;13 and (ii) movement of people and goods along CAREC corridors and across borders \nmade efficient.14 The TA will have the following outcome: modernized SPS systems with capacity \nto ensure food safety, animal and plant health.15  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: Sanitary and phytosanitary working groups organized. The TA will assist \neach country in creating a national SPS working group, which will develop and oversee the \nimplementation of national strategies to modernize SPS measures.16 The group may be a subset \nof the National Trade Facilitation Committee or similar mechanism if it already exists, or a \nprecursor of such once it is constituted. Representatives from these groups will constitute the \nregional SPS working group.  \n \n10.  Output 2: National sanitary and phytosanitary measures substantially aligned with \ninternational standards. Regulations, procedures, and requirements will be formulated to align \nwith the principles of the SPS Agreement and international standards under the OIE, IPPC, and \nCodex Alimentarius Commission. National SPS working groups will define risk-based (i) national \npest lists and import requirements, (ii) categories of animal diseases important to trade, goods \nsubject to veterinary control, and notifiable diseases, (iii) assessment criteria and categories for \nfood products. These groups will set up risk-based inspection and testing through a mandatory \nHACCP  system,  and  harmonize  chemical  and  microbiological  food  safety  parameters  and \nsampling protocols with Codex and other standards. The regional SPS working group will develop \nCAREC unified certificates for export, import, and transit and agree on mutual recognition of \nlaboratory results.  \n                                                \n10  Afghanistan, PRC, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Tajikistan.   \n11  Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, and Tajikistan. \n12  Afghanistan is a new member, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan are observers, and Turkmenistan is preparing for \naccession. \n13 ADB. 2012.

Output 3: Technical capacities on SPS measures at selected common borders \nimproved. National SPS working groups will develop and implement a border SPS management \nstrategy, formulate standard operating procedures for border control, and select at least two \nborder  points  to  pilot  the  strategy.17 The  TA  will  train  personnel  on  the  modernized  SPS \nregulations, procedures, and requirements.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,550,000 equivalent, of which (i) $750,000 equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund,18 and $800,000 \nequivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction \nand Regional Cooperation Fund19 and administered by ADB. Appendix 2 lists the key expenditure \nitems.  \n \n13.  The governments in each country will provide counterpart support in the form of an order \ninstructing their SPS- and trade-related agencies to constitute a national SPS working group, as \nwell as other in-kind contributions. The governments will also designate personnel to carry out \nthe tasks outlined in their national SPS strategies. Each national SPS working group will nominate \na representative to the regional SPS working group.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA and serve as executing agency. The Public Management, \nFinancial Sector, and Regional Cooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department, responsible \nfor the CAREC Trade Facilitation Program, will serve as the focal point and supervise the activities \nin coordination with the CAREC Unit of the Central and West Asia Department, the concerned \nresident missions in CAREC countries, and the CAREC Institute. ADB will engage individual \nconsultants who will work closely with ADB to discuss progress and findings. For TA activities in \nMongolia, the consultants will coordinate with the ADB Regional Upgrades and SPS Measures \nfor Trade Project, particularly the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (executing agency) and the \nproject implementation unit, to ensure complementarity of inputs and outputs.20 ADB will organize \nthe  workshops.  Meetings  involving  ADB,  SPS  working  groups,  SPS  agencies,  and  other \nstakeholders and consultants will be held when necessary to provide guidance to consultants and \nreview draft reports. ADB will consult with and obtain technical inputs from specialized agencies \nsuch as OIE, IPPC, and Codex Alimentarius Commission. \n                                                \n17 Possible  border  points  for improving  SPS operations and  facilities  (with emphasis on  perishables)  include \n(i) Chaldovar\u2013Merke (Lugovaya) border crossing point (BCP) between the Kyrgyz Republic and Kazakhstan; (ii) Ak-\nZhol\u2013Korday and Aktilek\u2013Karasu BCPs between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic; (iii) Dostuk\u2013Dustlik road BCP \nbetween the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan; (iv) Istaravshan-Khavast BCP between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan; \n(v) Torkham\u2013Peshawar/Landi Kotal BCP between Afghanistan and Pakistan; (vi) is Shirkhan Bandar - Nizhni Pianj \nBCP between Afghanistan and Tajikistan; (vii) Hairaton\u2013Termez (Ayraton) BCP for cotton and grain exports from \nKazakhstan and Uzbekistan to Pakistan; (viii) Red Bridge or Krasnyi Most (road BCP) and Beyuk Kesik (rail BCP) - \nGabdabani between Georgia and Azerbaijan port on Caspian Sea; and (ix) Zamiin-Uud\u2013Erenhot BCP between \nMongolia and the PRC.
