THE ENSUING PROGRAM \n \n1.  The Government of Nepal has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a $150 \nmillion programmatic policy-based loan from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary capital resources for \nthe proposed South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Customs and Logistics Reforms \nProgram. The program is aligned with the ADB country partnership strategy for Nepal, 2020\u20132024 \nunder strategic objective 1 which prioritizes logistics as a key factor in improving domestic and \ncross-border connectivity.1 The program and this transaction technical assistance (TA) are \nincluded in the indicative country pipeline and monitoring (ICPM) report, 2022-2024.2  \n \n2.  The program aims to improve competitiveness of the logistics industry in Nepal through \nreforms in regulations, business processes, and the institutional and governance structure that \nwill help reduce the cost of trade, improve domestic supply chain management, facilitate trade, \nand generate quality employment. The program\u2019s impact is growth and diversification of trade \nachieved.3 The program\u2019s outcome is efficiency of domestic and cross-border trade increased. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The  TA  will  help  the  Government  of  Nepal  implement  the  South  Asia  Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation Customs and Logistics Reforms Program, specifically in analytical studies \nto underpin the implementation of reform measures and building its capacity to execute the reform \nmeasures. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n4.  The TA outputs will help achieve the program\u2019s policy actions. \n \n5.  Output 1: Analytical studies on selected topics of the logistics industry prepared. The \ntopics will cover the areas under the program and include the following: trade and transport \ninfrastructure  and  services;  trade  and  transit  facilitation;  distribution  and  related  services; \nstandards, testing, and certification; and crosscutting themes such as e-commerce and advanced \nlogistics systems (consolidation, mechanization, and digitization). The studies will undertake \nextensive review of literature on the sectors in the context of logistics development, identify global \nbest practices, and assess their suitability for adoption in Nepal given its social, political, economic, \nand geographical conditions. Rigorous technical analyses will be conducted by looking at the \ninterplay  between  and  among  thematic  sectors  and  identify  the  factors  that  would  ensure \nseamless connectivity within the context of an overall logistics industry. The study will also \nanalyze existing gaps in the policies, regulations, and institutional framework. \n \n6.  Output 2: Enhanced business processes operationalized. Under this output, the TA \nwill support the installation of a transparent and consistent cross-border trade and transit process. \nThis will be done through the conduct of studies to restructure customs processes for faster, \neasier, and cheaper logistics-related transactions. In addition, the TA will facilitate the formulation \n \n1    ADB.  2019.  Country  Partnership  Strategy,  2020\u20132024\u2014Promoting  Connectivity,  Devolved  Services,  and \nResilience.
