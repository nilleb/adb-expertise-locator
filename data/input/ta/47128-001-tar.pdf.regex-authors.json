The proposed capacity development technical assistance (TA) will support the Ministry \nof Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development (MLFRD) to design and implement an off-grid \nrenewable  energy  demonstration  project  that  will  (i)  support  the  installation  of  renewable \nenergy-based systems for providing energy access (mostly solar photovoltaic and biomass-\nbased systems) to schools and other public infrastructure in at least 25 villages; (ii) develop \ngeospatial, least-cost energy access plans and an investment plan for select states and regions \nin  the  country;  and  (iii)  strengthen  the  capacity  of  government  institutions  to  design  and \nimplement small-scale renewable energy systems in off-grid areas. The TA will be financed by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and will build on the ongoing pilot activities under \nthe Energy for All (Phase 1) TA project.1 The proposed TA addresses key medium-term goals \nelaborated in the interim country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132014 for Myanmar: (i) assisting the \ngovernment in promoting sustainable and inclusive economic development and job creation in \nsupport  of  poverty  reduction;  (ii)  enhancing  connectivity\u2014domestic  and  regional,  rural  and \nurban\u2014through improved infrastructure; and (iii) helping accelerate economic growth, create \nincome  opportunities,  and  bridge rural\u2013urban gaps  in  economic  opportunities.2 The  scope, \nexpected  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  costs,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference were discussed with the government and finalized during \na fact-finding mission in November 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1.3 \n    \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita gross domestic \nproduct of $857, and a human development index rank of 149 out of 187 countries; 26% of its \npopulation lived in poverty in 2010.4 In response to ongoing major reforms by the Government of \nMyanmar toward a democratic system and market-based economy, ADB began to reengage \nwith Myanmar, in early 2012.  \n \n3.  Energy poverty in Myanmar. According to the International Energy Agency, Myanmar \nis an extreme example of energy poverty. Myanmar\u2019s per capita electricity consumption was \nonly 140 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year, which is the lowest among the 10 Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. The low national average per capita electricity \nconsumption is due to the low electrification ratio, low industrial development, and lack of \ninvestment. The country\u2019s average electrification5 grew from about 16% in 2006 to 28% in 2012. \nYangon City has the highest electrification ratio (72%), followed by Nay Pyi Taw (65%), Kayah \n(42%),  and  Mandalay  (35%). 6  Lack  of  electricity  impedes  economic  development  and \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals.7 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Myanmar: Energy Sector Initial Assessment. Manila. \n ", "2 \n4.  Renewable energy potential. Myanmar has abundant renewable energy resources, \nincluding solar, hydropower, biomass, and some wind power. Of these, only hydropower has \nbeen  developed  and  used  on  a  limited commercial  scale,  with  2,520  megawatts (MW)  of \nhydropower installed in Myanmar as of 2012; this compares to a total potential of over 100,000 \nMW. Other renewable energy resources are being researched or in pilot stages of development.  \n \n5.  Off-grid energy access programs of the Government of Myanmar. Until September \n2013, the government\u2019s Ministry of Industry (MOI) was responsible for providing electricity to off-\ngrid  areas  in  the  country.  In  addition  to  off-grid  micro-hydro,  solar,  biogas,  and  biomass \ninstallations,  about  39  off-grid  villages  have  also  been  electrified  by  various  government \nministries using diesel generators.8 The Department of Rural Development (DRD), which was \nformerly  within  the  Ministry  of  Border  Areas  (MOBA),  has  also  been  carrying  out  rural \ninfrastructure development activities in the country, including the deployment of small-scale rural \nenergy  systems  such  as  pico-  and  micro-hydro  sites,  solar  photovoltaic  mini-grids,  solar \nlanterns, and solar home systems.  \n \n6.  As of 2013, installations of 38 off-grid micro hydropower plants have been completed by \nthe Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI). The plants are owned and operated by the \nMinistry of Electric Power (MOEP). The Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry \nhas promoted the use of efficient cooking and heating stoves. The Ministry of Science and \nTechnology (MOST), with support from MOI, has built community-based and family-sized fixed-\ndome type biogas digester plants in nearly 200 villages, mainly in the central region (Mandalay, \nSagaing, and Magway divisions).9 Solar energy has been provided by MOI in a few off-grid \nvillages to generate electricity for street and home lighting, and other community uses. The \ngovernment has recently assigned MLFRD the responsibility for providing rural infrastructure, \nwhich includes rural energy access; as a consequence the DRD has been moved from MOBA \nto MLFRD. \n  \n7.  Barriers  to  renewable  energy  deployment.  Harnessing  Myanmar\u2019s  abundant \nrenewable energy resources to increase energy access is hampered by several factors: (i) lack \nof a fully transparent institutional and legal framework to support exploration, development, and \ndeployment; (ii) limited financial resources to support research and development, market-based \ninvestment programs, and development of physical infrastructure; (iii) lack of trained personnel \nto install and operate systems; and (iv) subsidized power and petroleum prices, which make it \ndifficult for wind and solar energy to be competitive. Establishment of a supportive environment \nfor development of Myanmar\u2019s renewable energy resources should include: (i) more information \non the country\u2019s renewable energy resource potential; (ii) improved interministerial cooperation \nand  coordination;  (iii)  promotion  of  private  sector  participation;  (iv)  clarification  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s policy on renewable energy; and (v) dissemination of technology for family-size \nbiogas digesters, mini-hydropower plants, and other options for increasing rural energy access.  \n \n8.  During  2010\u20132013,  MOI  was  given  the  responsibility  for  increasing  off-grid  energy \naccess.  MOI  presented  a  project  proposal  for  rural  energy  development  at  the  Myanmar \nDevelopment Cooperation Forum, held 19\u201320 January 2013 in Nay Pyi Taw.10 This proposal \n                                                \n8  Energy and renewable energy policies and activities are currently distributed among seven ministries\u2014the Ministry \nof Energy, MOI, Ministry of Electric Power, the Ministry of Science and Technology, MLFRD, Ministry of Agriculture \nand Irrigation, and Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry. \n9  Data provided by MOI and MOST. In June 2013, an ADB mission visited four villages with biogas digester plants \nand solar photovoltaic installations in Mandalay division together with MOI and MOST staff. \n10 Directorate of Industrial Planning, Ministry of Industry. 2013.

In response to MOI\u2019s request, ADB initiated pilot off-grid renewable energy activities \n(Phase 1) using TA grant funds from the Energy for All program (footnote 1). Phase 1 focuses \non piloting a limited number of off-grid clean energy installations in 20 villages in Chin State (in \neastern Myanmar) and the Mandalay region (in central Myanmar), and developing a geospatial \nleast-cost energy access plan for the Mandalay region. These activities are being implemented \nfrom October 2013 to May 2014 with MOI as the executing agency.  \n \n9.  In September 2013, the President of Myanmar moved the DRD from MOBA to MLFRD \nand gave the reconfigured ministry responsibility for rural infrastructure provision, including \nenergy access. MLFRD will now chair the national rural electrification and drinking water supply \ncommittee, which reports to the vice-president;  members include MOI, MOST, MOAI, MOEP, \nand the Ministry of National Development and Economic Planning. In addition to being the \nexecuting agency for community-driven rural energy projects supported by the World Bank and \nADB, MLFRD is embarking on an ambitious energy access program and has submitted a \nsupplementary budget request for 2014 to Parliament. This work would constitute phase 2 of \nADB\u2019s engagement in increasing access to renewable energy in Myanmar\u2019s off-grid areas. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  The  TA  will  complement  the  on-grid  focus  of  the  distribution  system  rehabilitation \nfinanced by a recently approved ADB loan on power distribution improvement.11 This TA will \nimprove the capacity of MLFRD12 and other agencies to design and implement renewable \nenergy- based energy access projects, develop investment plans for scaling up energy access \nin the  central dry zone (Mandalay, Sagaing, and Magway regions); and cover Chin, Kayah, and \nRakhine states13, and finance pilots installations in these locations.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be increased access to energy in rural Myanmar from renewable energy \nsources. The impact is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,14 which promotes inclusive and \nenvironmentally  sustainable  economic  growth.  The  TA  is  also  consistent  with  the  United \nNations\u2019 international year of sustainable energy for all, which emphasized the importance of \nenergy access for sustainable development. The TA will lead to the installation of 10 MW of \nnew,  small-scale renewable  energy  capacity  by  2022;  provide  access  to modern forms of \nenergy for 0.4 million households and public facilities such as schools by 2022; and result in \nregional  governments  making  financial  provisions  and  organizational  commitments  in  their \nannual  budgets  to  expand  energy  access.  The  outcome  will  be  improved  capacity  and \ncommitment within MLFRD and the governments of select regions and states to design and \nmanage rural energy access programs using renewable energy resources.  \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2013.

The TA outputs are (i) renewable energy systems designed and installed in 25 villages \nto power community infrastructure and households; these will be primarily solar photovoltaic and \nbiomass-based  systems,  targeting  the  central  dry  zone  (Mandalay,  Sagaing,  and  Magway \nregions) and Chin, Kayah, and Rakhine states; (ii) geospatial least-cost energy access and \ninvestment plans for select regions and states of the country developed; and (iii) skills and \nabilities of staff in government entities and the private sector strengthened. This will include \nassessing the potential for and providing assistance for the creation of a separate government \nagency or entity that would focus on off-grid energy access. The feasibility of alternate financing \napproaches such as revolving funds and output-based aid will also be evaluated.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of staff time, office space, staff travel \ncosts, and other in-kind contributions; and will be responsible for any civil works and related \nengineering design that may be required for the pilot installations. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  MLFRD  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  choice  of  executing  agency  was \nconfirmed through consultations with MLFRD, the National Energy Management Committee \n(NEMC), MOI, and MOEP during an ADB fact-finding mission on November 2013. A steering \ncommittee  composed  of  senior  officials  from  the  National  Rural  Development  Committee, \nNEMC, Ministry of Energy, MOEP, MOBA, MOAI, and MOST will oversee TA implementation \nand  provide  inputs.  The  committee  will  also  include  a  senior  representative  from  a \nnongovernmental or civil society organization. Within ADB, this project will be managed by the \nSoutheast Asia Energy Division with support from the Energy for All regional TA (footnote 1), \nand ADB\u2019s Extended Mission in Myanmar. The DRD within MLFRD will be the implementing \nagency. The TA will also work closely with the regional governments of the selected areas for \ndevelopment and implementation of the pilot installations, and the Electricity Supply Enterprise, \nthe power utility, for development of the geospatial plans. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time).  \n \n15.  A total of approximately 101 person-months of consulting services (36 person-months \nfor international consultants and 65 person-months for national consultants) will be engaged \nthrough a firm. The consulting firm will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) through quality and cost-based \nselection (with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20) and using full technical proposals. International \nconsultants will include (i) energy access planning and renewable energy technical specialist \nand team leader, (ii) off-grid solar photovoltaic solution specialist, (iii) biogas or biomass energy \nspecialist,  (iv)  micro-hydro  specialist,  (v)  renewable  energy  finance  specialist,  (vi)  capacity \ndevelopment and institutional strengthening specialist, (vii) geospatial planning specialist, (viii) \ngeographical information systems (GIS) specialist, and (ix) procurement specialist. National \nconsultants will have expertise that complements that of the international experts, and will \nsupport them in their work. The outline of the terms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. \nThe consultants will be responsible for administration of training, seminars and conferences, \n ", "    5 \nand surveys, as reflected in their terms of reference. The consultants will design, procure, and \ninstall  the  pilot  off-grid  renewable  energy  facilities  under  the  TA.  All  goods  (equipment) \npurchased under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time) and will be turned over to the executing agency upon \ncompletion of the TA project. \n \n16.  The TA implementation period will be from June 2014 to June 2017. The MLFRD will set \nup a project management unit and provide an office for the consultants in Nay Pyi Taw along \nwith the requisite utilities, and support the costs of their staff time for project activities and travel \nto project sites in the region. Local governments in the states and regions for which detailed \ngeospatial maps and energy access plans will be prepared and where the villages selected for \nrenewable energy-based electrification will be located will provide the consultants with access to \nrelevant data and information, and provide office space and travel and logistics support as \nrequired. MOEP, MOST, MOAI, MOBA, and other government ministries and agencies will \nprovide access to baseline information and resource surveys that have been conducted.15  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n  \n17.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Myanmar to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, for the Off-Grid Renewable \nEnergy Demonstration Project. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n15 Renewable resource surveys will build on resource data\u2014e.g., regarding solar radiation, water flow, and bio-waste \ngenerated\u2014currently available from government agencies and international institutions. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and Indicators  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased access to  About 10 MW of new small-scale  Government  MLFRD retains its \nenergy in rural Myanmar  renewable energy capacity installed and  statistics  mandate to develop \nfrom renewable energy  an additional 0.4 million householdsa    community-oriented \nsources  and 100 public facilities such as schools  Surveys by NGOs  energy access \nobtain access to modern forms of  and UN agencies    programs and is \nenergyb by 2022    strengthened with \n  Annual budget  time \n  activity reports for   \nregional  Risk \ngovernments and  Government decides \nMLFRD, MOI,  to replace \nMOEP and NEMC  community-driven \nprograms with grid-\nextension by ESE \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved capacity and  By 2017:   Government  Government and \ncommitment within    statistics  international \nMLFRD and the  At least three states or regions endorse    development agency \ngovernments of select  least cost electrification plans in the off- MLFRD, MOI,  financing earmarked \nregions and states to  grid areas   MOEP, and NEMC  for community-driven \ndesign and manage rural    reports  energy programs \nenergy access programs  Up to 25 small-scale renewable energy-    \nusing renewable energy  based mini-grids (totaling 0.25 MW  TA reports   Private sector \nresources  capacity) generation facilities     investors and local \ndeveloped and installedc  ADB mission reports   and regional banks \n    interested in financing \nAt least 10,000 people have increased    rural energy access \naccess to energy    projects  \n   \nRisk \nBenefits accrue to \nnon-poor segments of \nsociety \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.
