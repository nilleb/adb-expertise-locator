INTRODUCTION \n1.  Project  implementation  and  administration  (PIA)  remains  a  challenge  for  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) and its borrowers. Since 1978, ADB has funded PIA seminars with \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grants  to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  borrowers  and  executing \nagencies (EAs) to manage projects. Senior and mid-level officials of EAs, central ministries, \nstate  banks,  and  state  and  provincial  governments  from  34  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs)  have  participated  in  and  benefited  from  these  seminars,  which  have  centered  on \npolicies and procedures for the procurement of goods, works, and consulting services, and for \ndisbursement.  \n \n2.  Seminars have so far been the medium of choice for procurement capacity development. \nThere is now a need to (i) improve traditional seminar approaches and materials; (ii) design and \ndeliver  short  courses  as  needed;  (iii) develop  and  introduce  new  e-learning  approaches; \n(iii) extend  procurement  capacity  development  beyond  the  training  programs  by  raising \nawareness of the importance of effective and efficient procurement systems in the project cycle, \nand developing and implementing supporting interventions; and (iv) introduce output monitoring \nsystems. The foregoing measures are particularly important given the anticipated emphasis of \nmany of ADB\u2019s DMCs on the use of country procurement systems.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Country portfolio review missions and regular project supervision missions continue to \nobserve delays in project implementation caused by EAs\u2019 lack of understanding and familiarity \nwith ADB\u2019s procurement and disbursement policies and procedures. The high turnover of EA \nstaff, typical of a project-based business environment, compounds the problem. A fundamental \nissue is the low importance accorded by DMCs to procurement. Procurement must take on a \nhigher profile, and project implementation capacity must constantly improve. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  General \n \n4.  In this regional capacity development TA, not only will conventional PIA seminars in \nDMCs and regional seminars at ADB headquarters be held, as in the past, but short courses on \nspecific procurement activities will also be prepared and delivered, as needed. Taking a broader \nview of procurement capacity development, the TA will help identify, design, and implement \nprocurement interventions at different stages of the ADB project cycle that will improve the \neffectiveness and efficiency of projects. By introducing e-learning processes, the TA will also \nextend training to a wider audience, thereby making capacity development more sustainable. \nThese initiatives will enable EAs to provide more integrated support throughout the project cycle \nfrom June 2009 to May 2011. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The management of ADB\u2019s project portfolio in its DMCs would improve. Staff in DMC \nEAs  and  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  would  procure  goods,  works,  and  services \n ", "2   \n(including consulting services) efficiently and at competitive prices, and according to ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). With the help of more varied \ntraining  approaches,  and  procurement  interventions  throughout  the  project  cycle,  project \ndirectors,  managers,  and  other  key  staff  members  of  EAs,  PIUs,  and  other  government \ncounterpart agencies should develop the required proficiency in PIA. \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n  1.  Project Implementation and Administration Seminars \n \n6.  At least 18 PIA seminars will be conducted in the DMCs, and 1 PIA seminar at ADB \nheadquarters and 1 PIA regional seminar will be held yearly.  \n7.  The country seminars will have three basic components: recruitment of consultants, \nprocurement of goods and civil works, and disbursement. The actual program in each country \nwill depend on the needs of the EAs concerned. The seminars will be interactive and will \nintegrate the use of online facilities with lectures, case studies, group discussions, workshops, \nand  practical  exercises.  They  will  normally  be  conducted  in  English,  with  translation  and \ninterpretation facilities if needed. The seminars will deal mainly with the responsibilities of \nmanagers and other key project officials in project implementation, particularly during project \nstart-up\u2014procurement  management,  bidding,  and  project  design  and  monitoring  and  the \nattendant  critical  implementation  concerns  in  relation  to  ADB\u2019s  results  framework.  Where \nappropriate, project management tools like the critical path method will be used; current PIA \nmodules, particularly case studies, will be made more interactive and consistent with recent \nchanges in ADB\u2019s project processing and implementation procedures; and guest speakers from \nEAs, government and other procurement agencies, and project management entities will be \ninvited to share their knowledge and experience.  \n8.  The ADB headquarters and regional seminars will be similarly structured, but they will be \nconcerned  mainly  with  procurement  policy  and  will  also  include  presentations  on  broader \naspects  of  ADB  operations  for  new  project  directors  and  senior  policy  makers  of  central \ngovernment agencies in the DMCs. \n  2.  Demand-Based Short Procurement Courses  \n9.  Regional departments have asked ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office (COSO) to \ndeliver short courses for new EAs shortly after a project is approved. Therefore, besides the PIA \nseminars described in para. 7, shorter training courses will be designed and implemented as \nneeded. The courses might be designed and implemented for a particular project or a particular \nprocurement activity, e.g., reviewing bid documents, evaluating bids, evaluating proposals, or \npreparing terms of reference. \n  3.  E-Learning and E-Learning Modules \n10.  The development of e-learning tools, to spread awareness of procurement policies, \nprocedures, issues, and allow wider use of the interactive exercises and case studies, will have \npriority. The e-learning applications will (i) complement the traditional approach to PIA seminars \nby increasing awareness and understanding of procurement policies and procedures even \nbefore the seminar, thereby freeing up seminar time for virtual interactive case studies and \n ", "                       3   \nshortening the duration of the seminar overall; and (ii) extend the reach of specific procurement \nissues and activities. One e-learning tool would be a mandatory interactive introduction to ADB\u2019s \npolicies  and  procedures  for  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement.  Other \ne-learning  courses,  including  the  guided  preparation  of  procurement  risk  and  capacity \nassessments  and  procurement  plans,  would  be  based  on  demand.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in \ndeveloping e-learning approaches would also be helpful to public procurement and monitoring \noffices in the DMCs in developing their national e-learning programs. The e-learning portal \nwould likewise soften the impact of the high turnover of staff in EAs by making it possible for \nnew staff to learn online rather than wait for the next training course. All e-learning tools would \nbe developed in English, Mandarin, Russian, Vietnamese, and other languages. \nD.  Monitoring Impact and Outcome \n11.  No structured monitoring of the impact or outcome of the PIA seminars has ever been \nundertaken. Output monitoring has been limited to usefulness to participants, based on their \nfeedback after the seminars. Under this TA, the efficiency of procurement in general and, more \nspecifically, the direct impact of the seminars on and their benefits to participants will also be \nevaluated through follow-up questionnaires distributed to participants in previous seminars. This \nincreased emphasis on output monitoring is reflected in Appendix 1, which clearly shows the \nperformance targets and indicators, verification sources, and assumptions and risks. \nE.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA of about $1,500,000 equivalent will support about 18 country PIA \nseminars, an annual PIA seminar at ADB headquarters, an annual regional PIA seminar, short \nprocurement courses designed and delivered as needed, and pilot-testing and implementation \nof e-learning modules for procurement, consulting services, and disbursement. The detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed with a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram (TASF-IV). \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will begin in June 2009 and end in June 2011. COSO will be the EA and will be \nresponsible for implementing (i) the PIA seminars, (ii) the demand-based short courses in \nprocurement, (iii) the e-learning tools, and (iv) PIA output-based monitoring. \n \n14.  COSO will prioritize and prepare a PIA seminar program for each year during the TA \nperiod. Priority in program planning will be given to DMCs that (i) have assigned responsibility \nfor loans approved in 2008 and 2009 to new EAs; (ii) are implementing large portfolios; (iii) have \nrequested inclusion in the PIA program; and (iv) have been identified for support by ADB user \ndepartments, resident missions, or project review missions. Concerned government agencies \nand  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments,  project  administration  unit  heads  network,  and  resident \nmissions will be asked to nominate participants in the seminars. The resident missions will \nassist in coordinating logistic arrangements. Where appropriate, they will also guide COSO in \ndeciding on program content and, in cooperation with government agencies, in determining the \ntopics  that  need  to  be  emphasized  in  the  seminars.  COSO  will  hire  a  consulting  firm  or \nindividual consultants to help update or upgrade the PIA training materials, and will implement \nthe PIA seminar program in cooperation with ADB\u2019s Controller\u2019s Department, which will provide \nthe facilitator for the disbursement component.  \n \n ", "4   \n15.  COSO will also coordinate the preparation and delivery of demand-based short-term \nprocurement courses, and will hire either a consulting firm or individual consultants to help \nprepare and, if necessary and appropriate, deliver the courses.  \n \n16.  From a review of the evaluation reports prepared by previous PIA seminar participants \nand  the  procurement  capacity  development  requirements,  key  topics  in  procurement, \nconsulting, and disbursement will be selected for the e-learning exercises. COSO will hire a \nconsulting firm or individual consultants to help design, pilot-test, and implement the e-learning \nmodules. \n \n17.  All consultants will be hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will conform to ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.1 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor the Procurement Capacity Development for Project Implementation and Administration for \n2009\u20132011, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008.
