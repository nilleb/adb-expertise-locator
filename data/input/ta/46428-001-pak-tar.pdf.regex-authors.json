INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This technical assistance (TA) project will support enhanced safeguards management in \ntwo key federal agencies\u2014the National Highways Authority (NHA) and the Water and Power \nDevelopment Authority (WAPDA).1 Both authorities implement major greenfield projects that \nresult in significant land acquisition and resettlement impacts. The Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  approved  its  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009). Both  the  NHA  and  WAPDA  have \nenvironment and social units; however, the NHA has no resettlement or social specialists in the \nunit. The WAPDA\u2019s Land Acquisition and Resettlement Unit (LARU) is relatively new, having \nbeen established in 2010, and has yet to recruit a resettlement specialist. \n \n2.  The TA will focus on improving institutional safeguards management to address internal \ncapacity  constraints  and  providing  legal  advice,  interpretation,  and  recommendations  on \napplicable  national  and  provincial  laws  to  address  resettlement-related  issues  in  the  NHA \n(regarding transport) and the WAPDA (regarding water and power development). The NHA and \nWAPDA will be the executing agencies for the TA. Each agency will appoint a qualified director \nfor resettlement prior to TA implementation. The Government of Pakistan concurred with the TA \nand ADB fielded a mission to discuss TA activities with the NHA and WAPDA. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The absence of a national or provincial policy on resettlement in Pakistan results in \ndisplacement and compensation issues being addressed in an ad hoc manner with a high risk of \nimpoverishment to those affected. Typically, internally financed projects suffer from insufficient \ncompensation  to  replace  lost  assets,  delayed  payments,  insufficient  planning  for  livelihood \nrestoration, social and cultural disarticulation, exclusion of untitled persons from development \nsupport, and lack of attention to gender and vulnerable groups. No relevant requirements for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  exist  within  government  systems.  A  resettlement  ordinance  was \nprepared under ADB regional TA,2 however it was not passed by the legislature. National and \nprovincial commitment is required to pass a resettlement act and/or revise provincial legislation \nto enable laws to be more responsive to Pakistan's development needs. Improvements to reflect \ninternational best practice standards are essential if Pakistan is to obtain external financing of \nthe public or private sector. Under ongoing regional TA,3 ADB is working with the board of \nrevenue  (BOR)  of  Punjab  province  to  streamline  land  acquisition  procedures  and  provide \ncapacity  development  to  key  executing  agencies.  Overhauling  a  disparate  system  of  land \nadministration  and  acquisition  that  has  changed  little  since  colonial  times  is  a  long-term \nundertaking. There is no uniform national approach or system; issues in each province have to \nbe addressed separately. \n \n4.  Pakistan is one of ADB\u2019s major partners. ADB\u2019s active portfolio in Pakistan consists of \n19 projects with an approved amount of $3.5 billion. During 2007-2011, the annual average \ncontract award in Pakistan has been around $1.1 billion and disbursement achievement around \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) website on 15 \nNovember 2012. \n2  ADB. 2000.

Technical Assistance for Mainstreaming Land Acquisition and Resettlement Safeguards in Central and \nWest Asia Region. Manila (TA 7433-REG, approved in December, for $5 million). \n ", "2 \n$1.0 billion.4 ADB has a relatively young portfolio with many greenfield projects with a strong \nfocus on energy and transport which require substantial safeguards work. The absence of a \nregulatory framework, and outdated systems coupled with limited technical capacity, is the \nprincipal challenge facing effective resettlement management in Pakistan.5 \n \n5.  Project preparation. Considerable up front work needs to be undertaken to address \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The Planning Commission\u2019s documents required for project \napproval (PC-1 and PC-2) often  underestimate costs of land acquisition and resettlement, \nincluding safeguard staff in project management units. Social safeguards are viewed primarily \nas a requirement of international financial institutions and bilateral donors, which the executing \nagencies struggle to comply with. Therefore, the response is usually ad hoc and reactive. Tasks \nare outsourced to consultants while the executing agencies lack sufficient in-house technical \nexpertise and systems to ensure safeguard compliance. Further, the government system has no \npositions or service structure for social safeguards. \n \n6.  During  project  preparation,  insufficient  attention  is  paid  to  project  implementation. \nSafeguards  are  not  considered  integral  to  effective  project  delivery.  Improved  coordination \nbetween design, contract bidding, award of civil works, and safeguards implementation is key to \nensuring  project  implementation  complies  with  safeguards.  Safeguards  monitoring  is  not \nrequired under national systems, and this leads to poor compliance with loan covenants. In \naddition,  unlike  elsewhere  in  the  region,  civil  society  engagement  in  addressing  social \nsafeguards issues is limited. \n \n7.  Implementation delays due to poor safeguard compliance. One of the key reasons \nfor implementation delays in ADB-financed projects in Pakistan is the quality of resettlement \nplans and implementation. Pakistan applies the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 (LAA) for land \nacquisition for public purpose and for companies. The LAA is not accompanied by rules and \nregulations; each province interprets and implements the act according to its own systems \nthrough the respective BORs. The LAA is a complex law which only addresses land acquisition \nand is not intended to address adverse social impacts or deal with large-scale relocation and \nsocial development. Systemic weakness, lack of transparency, communication, resources, poor \ngovernance, and lack of coordination with implementing partners, coupled with limited national \ncapacity  on  safeguards,  result  in  lengthy  delays  affecting  project  preparation  and \nimplementation. Lacking direct responsibility for land acquisition, the executing agencies have \nlimited coordination with the BORs, which exacerbates the problem and increases the risk of \nnoncompliance. \n \n8.  Capacity development for safeguards in Pakistan requires long-term investment by the \ngovernment as well as development partners. ADB and other development partners in the \ncountry are addressing some of the systemic issues related to land management, capacity \ndevelopment, and improved legal frameworks. However, there are still gaps at the operational \nand institutional levels for short- (including interpretation of the current legal framework) and \nmedium-term gains.  \n \n9.  Efforts to strengthen the capacities of executing agencies through short-term training \nand  close  supervision  by  ADB\u2019s  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  have  resulted  in  incremental \nimprovements. Current resident mission staff resources are inadequate to provide the level of \n                                                 \n4  This includes awards and disbursements through program lending. The average for program lending was around \n$1,050.7 million and for disbursement $722.5 million. \n5  The Pakistan Environment Protection Act (1997) is sufficient for addressing environment safeguards. \n ", "      3 \nsupport required to significantly improve executing agencies\u2019 safeguards management. The \nongoing  TA  for  the  Flood  Emergency  Reconstruction  Project6 demonstrates  the  benefit  of \ntechnical  support  to  executing  agencies  by  providing  consultants  for  both  preparation  and \nimplementation. Even with this support, timely and efficient delivery remains a major challenge. \nPractical approaches to streamlining and coordinating safeguards need to be developed and \nintegrated into business operations through standard operating procedures (SOPs) and tools to \nensure  a  structured  process  of  screening  for  safeguard  risk.  Until  national  and  provincial \nlegislation is developed, commitment to and ownership of safeguards by the executing agencies \nneed to be enhanced. \n  \n10.  National Highways Authority. The NHA established the Environment, Afforestation, \nLand and Social Safeguard Unit in 2007 at the headquarters in Islamabad, but there was no \nresettlement specialist. Staff resources in the environment section are better, with a director of \nenvironment and three staff members. However, four regional assistant director positions for \nenvironment remain vacant; similar positions for social safeguards are not available. The focus \nof the unit is on expeditious land acquisition and not on mitigating adverse social impacts. The \nNHA  has  52  ongoing  projects  across  Pakistan.  Staff  resources  in  the  Environment, \nAfforestation, Land and Social Safeguard Unit are insufficient and staff lack the skill to manage \nboth domestically and externally financed projects. Staff designated to work on resettlement are \nlegal experts with exposure and training on safeguards obtained by working on externally \nfinanced projects. Safeguards preparation is outsourced to large engineering firms with limited \nsafeguards capacity. The combined effect of the NHA\u2019s weak capacity and outsourcing to \nengineering  firms  is  poor  compliance  both  at  the  preparation  and  implementation  levels. \nInstitutional support and enhanced capacity is necessary if the NHA is to respond effectively to \nsocial safeguards issues. \n \n11.  Water and Power Development Authority. The WAPDA is responsible for developing \nmultipurpose water resources projects. Since the Ghazi Barotha project was completed in 2002, \nno new hydropower projects have been built. According to the Report of the Water Sector Task \nForce,7 the Tarbela project (officially completed in 1976 with funding from the World Bank) is still \n\u201cplagued\u201d by unsettled land compensation issues and uncertainty about numbers of displaced \nhouseholds. Pakistan faces a critical situation with regard to water storage and energy. Under \nthe WAPDA\u2019s vision 2025, eight priority projects for major dams at an estimated cost of $28.7 \nbillion are identified. The report further points out that there is \u201cmuch confusion\u201d in Pakistan \nabout benefit sharing, essentially paying special attention to those who \u201cpay the price\u201d in terms \nof giving up their lands and are resettled. Large-scale projects typically entail the resettlement of \nseveral thousand households. In 2010, the WAPDA established the LARU, which has had a \nhigh staff turnover. The WAPDA Environment Cell was established in 1987; however, it is not \nadequately integrated into the business operations. The principal challenge for the WAPDA in \nundertaking  major  resettlement  programs  is  the  limited  pool  of  expertise  and  experienced \nspecialists  in  the  LARU  and  in  Pakistan  in general.  Even  with  experienced  experts,  large \nresettlement programs require several full-time experts to be fully engaged in preparing and \nsupervising  implementation.  Capacity  and  systems  for  internal  monitoring  of  large-scale \nresettlement and environment performance are yet to be established. The model for project \ndevelopment  requires  a  shift  in  thinking  where  design,  civil  works,  and  safeguards  are \neffectively coordinated and projects are designed to be environmentally and socially sound. \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Flood Emergency Reconstruction \nProject.

The Report of the Water Sector Task Force: A Productive and Water \nSecure Pakistan (draft). \n ", "4 \n \n12.  BOR staff and engineering and management staff from the executing agencies will be \nincluded in key TA activities. A degree of institutional restructuring will be required to ensure the \nenvironment and social safeguard units are effectively incorporated into each agency\u2019s structure. \nTools for safeguards screening will be prepared to ensure a structured process for safeguards \nmanagement.  Resettlement  policies  for  each  agency  will  be  developed.  Coordination  with \nmultiple agencies will be supported, leading to development of procedures for interaction with \nkey stakeholders. The TA approach is to work directly with the NHA and WAPDA and jointly \ndevelop work plans to ensure ownership of and commitment to the expected changes resulting \nfrom the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  enhanced  safeguards  management  for  transport  projects \nexecuted by the NHA and water and power development projects executed by the WAPDA. The \noutcome of the TA is a safeguards management system established in each agency. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  Output 1: Legal, institutional, and capacity assessment report completed. The TA \nwill support the preparation of an assessment of internal mechanisms for incorporating both \nenvironmental and social safeguards in the executing agencies\u2019 business operations. SOPs and \ntools will be developed to support the integration of safeguards, as will tools to enable a uniform \nand structured process for safeguards risk assessment. Effort will be required to ensure these \nchanges  are  incorporated  through  official  instructions.  The  analysis  will  be  based  on  staff \ninterviews, review of existing SOPs, national and provincial acts and policies, and workshops \nwith relevant staff in each organization. Lack of political will and management changes may \naffect the final approval of the SOPs. \n \n15.  Output  2:  Policy  on  resettlement  and  operations  framework  on  safeguards \nmanagement developed. Stakeholder workshops will be held and the WAPDA resettlement \npolicy  finalized;  the  NHA  has  no  resettlement  policy.  A  draft  policy  will  be  prepared  and \nstakeholder consultations held. Board approval will be sought for the final policies. Review of \nexisting resettlement policies internationally, nationally, and within each organization will be \nconducted when developing the policies. Change in management and vested interests may \npose a risk to final approval of the policies.  \n \n16.  Output  3:  Advisory  service  provided  to  environment  and  social  units  in  the \nNational Highways Authority and Water and Power Development Authority. Hands on \ncapacity development will be provided to establish a complement of core safeguard staff in each \nagency.  Further,  the  TA  will  support  interpretation  of  laws  and  policies  and  recommend \napproaches  to  establish  transparent  mechanisms  for  achieving  replacement  cost  for \ncompensation. At least two resettlement plans in each agency will be selected for review and \nimprovement. Training will include key partner agencies such as the BORs and will include \nproblem-solving workshops, project site visits, and visits to external projects and agencies to \nlearn from their experience. Security concerns may prevent appropriate site visits in-country. \n \n17.  Output  4:  Technical  skills  of  Water  and  Power  Development  Authority  staff \nstrengthened. The WAPDA resettlement unit was established in 2010. The environment cell is \n ", "      5 \nnot adequately integrated within the organization. The LARU is relatively new and staff lack \nresettlement  experience.  Capacity  development  support  will  focus  on  problem-solving \nworkshops and engagement with key partner agencies, including external experts. At least two \nresettlement plans with significant impacts will be selected for review. The consultants will \nsupport  the  team  to  enhance  the  plans  and  think  through  planning,  implementation,  and \nsupervision of resettlement. External learning will be provided through visits to projects in the \nregion. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $612,000, of which $550,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, space for workshops, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The NHA and WAPDA are the executing agencies for the TA. The resident mission\u2019s \nSafeguards  Unit  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  TA  and  consultant  recruitment, \nprovision of information, reporting, and support to consultants where required in oversight, \nmonitoring, and evaluation. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010 as amended from time to time), and the \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The consultants will be located in the offices of the NHA, \nWAPDA, and the resident mission depending on the activities being undertaken at different \ntimes. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in December 2012, and will be \ncompleted in May 2014. \n \n20.  Staff in the units will work closely with the consultants to implement the TA. Staff will \nidentify workshop participants, support the consultants to identify core issues for discussion, and \njointly develop the agenda.  \n \n21.  The  TA  consultants  will  represent  multiple  disciplines  and  work  simultaneously  on \ndifferent activities. Except for the international resettlement expert, all experts will contribute to \nthe institutional analysis. Expert input includes an institutional specialist (12 person-months), a \nlegal specialist (6 person-months), national resettlement specialists (32 person-months, one \nteam leader), a grievance management specialist (6 person-months), management information \nsystem  specialists  (24  person-months),  a  monitoring  and  evaluation  specialist  (12  person-\nmonths), a communication specialist (6 person-months), an environment specialist (3 person-\nmonths),  and  an  international  resettlement  specialist  (4  person-months).  Recruitment  of \nconsultants will be based on individual consultant selection because of the limited period of the \nTA and the varied and specialized skills and experience required. The specialists will be located \nin Islamabad and Lahore. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n22.  The TA outputs will be disseminated through the resident mission website and the \nwebsite of each agency. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.
