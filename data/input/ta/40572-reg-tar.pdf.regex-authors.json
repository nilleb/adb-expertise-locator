The Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) ad hoc support task force1 requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) during its meeting in February 2006 to undertake, under a \ntechnical assistance (TA), a review of policies, practices, and regulatory standards for bond \nissuance in individual countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and Republic of Korea (collectively ASEAN+3) and explore \nthe possibility of harmonizing these standards and practices to facilitate the development of an \nAsian bond market. The ABMI is a regional initiative established under the Forum of Finance \nMinisters of ASEAN+3. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The concept \npaper of the proposed TA was approved by management on 1 September 2006.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  One of the most valuable lessons from the 1997 Asian financial crisis is that the region \nmust develop bond markets as an alternative funding source to bank loans. Prior to the crisis, \nfinancial institutions and corporations in the region relied on foreign currency loans for funding. \nInadequate hedging, however, made them vulnerable to foreign exchange risks. In addition, \nmuch  of  the  borrowing  was  short  term  for  financing  long-term  investment.  Poor  corporate \ngovernance at both corporations and financial institutions, together with poor supervision of \nfinancial  institutions,  meant  credit  was  poorly  allocated,  contributing  to  the  weaknesses  of \nbanks\u2019 balance sheets. These combined factors triggered the financial crisis. Since the crisis, \npolicy  makers  in  the  region  have  undertaken  structural  reforms  to  improve  corporate \ngovernance in financial institutions and corporations and strengthen financial supervision.  They \nhave reached a consensus on the need to promote the development of a regional bond market \nto ensure the availability of long-term domestic currency funding, prevent maturity and currency \nmismatches, and channel the region\u2019s savings into regional investment.  \n3.  In August 2003, the ASEAN+3 finance ministers established the ASEAN+3 ABMI to \nfoster the development of a regional bond market. ABMI intends to promote the development of \ndomestic and regional bond markets by (i) facilitating a wide variety of issuers\u2019 access to the \nbond markets and (ii) removing policy and regulatory impediments to developing the markets. \nActivities under the ABMI complement those undertaken by other regional forums to promote \nbond market development, including those of the Executives' Meeting of the East Asia-Pacific \nCentral Banks and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation.  \n4.  Bond markets in the region have been dominated largely by government bonds. As of \nDecember 2007, government bonds accounted for $9.5 trillion of the $11.2 trillion bonds issued \nin 2007 in the ASEAN+3 markets.3 Despite Asia\u2019s large pool of savings, regional cross-border \nissuance and investments have been insignificant. ASEAN+3 countries allocate only 2% of their \ninvestment in bonds to those issued in local currencies. Significant differences across the region \n                                                 \n1  Six  working  groups  were  originally  established  in  the  ABMI  to  address  key  constraints  on  bond  market \ndevelopment. In May 2005, they were reorganized into four working groups with an ad hoc support team for the \nfocal group and a technical assistance coordination team. Recently, the working groups were rearranged into four \nnew task forces focusing on four key areas: (i) promoting the issuance of local currency-denominated bonds \n(supply side); (ii) facilitating demand for local currency-denominated bonds (demand side); (iii) improving the \nregulatory framework; and (iv) improving related infrastructure for bond markets. \n2  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2006. \n3  ADB. Asian Bonds Online. http://asianbondsonline.adb.org/regional/regional.php ", "2   \nregarding accounting, tax treatment of debt securities, national legal systems, and investor \nprotection have made cross-border investment highly costly, constraining the development of a \nregional bond market.  \n5.  Because Europe has, more than any other region, successfully developed a deep and \nstable regional financial market, and as the European Union (EU) has the longest experience in \naddressing impediments to the creation of a single financial market, ASEAN+3 requested ADB \nto commission an issues paper on the EU\u2019s experience in developing the European bond \nmarket. It is thought that lessons from European experiences could serve as a conceptual \nframework for a regional bond market in Asia.  \n6.  The  issues  paper  identified  a  number  of  issues  to  address  as  first  steps  toward \nASEAN+3 countries\u2019 creating an integrated bond market in the region. Firstly, bond standards \nand  practices\u2014particularly  those  relating  to  issuing  procedures,  settlement,  listing  and \ndisclosure,  issuing  international  securities  identifying  numbers,  electronic  disclosure, \ndocumentation, secondary transactions, syndicate rule, and accounting and auditing\u2014would \nhave to be harmonized to encourage issuers\u2019 and investors\u2019 participation in the regional bond \nmarket.  \n7.  Secondly, there is a need to review policy, financial laws, and regulations established by \nsupervisory authorities and national self-regulatory organizations (SROs) in individual ASEAN+3 \ncountries to ensure that they do not impede the development of the regional bond market and \ndetermine how SROs could further facilitate the harmonization of bond standards. Eurobond \nmarkets were initially established by market participants on their own, with each market having \nits own bond standards. Subsequently, once SROs such as the International Primary Market \nAssociation and International Securities Market Association were established, they took the \ninitiative to harmonize standards for Eurobonds across the continent.     \n8.  Although government and corporate bonds in ASEAN+3 countries have been issued \nlargely through public offerings, private placement is an important distribution channel for both \ngovernment and corporate bonds. As private placement could widen the funding sources for \ncorporations without the stringent requirements of a public listing, while providing a degree of \nexposure to better understand the pricing of their debt instruments, private placement is highly \nattractive to corporations seeking to raise funds through the debt market. Standards for bonds \nissued through private placement are typically based on those for European bonds, and many of \nthe standards have no relevance to ASEAN+3 market conditions. A better understanding of \nstandards  for  bonds  issued  through  private  placement  is  essential  to  help  policy  makers \npromote the development of the regional bond market.  \n9.  The 11th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting in Madrid, in May 2008, agreed on the \nnew ABMI road map to provide further momentum to work that will be undertaken under the \nABMI. The objectives of this new, comprehensive ABMI road map are for member countries to \nmake  voluntary  efforts  to  further  develop  local  currency-denominated  bond  markets  and, \nthrough the efforts of individual countries and the concerted efforts of ASEAN+3, to seek to \ndevelop a regional bond market that is more accessible for both issuers and investors. \n10.  Thus, this TA is consistent with the new ASEAN+3  ABMI road map by helping to \nharmonize standards in the secondary government and corporate bond markets to facilitate \nissuers\u2019 and investors\u2019 participation. With greater participation by investors, the regional bond ", "      3\nmarket will further develop and become deeper, broader, more liquid, and more efficient in \npricing risks in the region. The work supported by this TA is under the purview of the ABMI task \nforce 3 for improving the regulatory framework.4 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The expected impact of the TA is a deeper, broader, more liquid, and more efficient \nregional bond market. The objective of the TA is to promote the development of domestic and \nregional  bond  markets  through  four  components:  (i) harmonizing  standards,  including \nregulations, practices, and infrastructure, in secondary government bond markets, including \nproposing measures to establish a government bond market forum to support the process; (ii) \nharmonizing standards for corporate bonds to facilitate cross-border issuance; (iii) strengthening \nSROs and/or establishing new ones, as appropriate, to facilitate the harmonization of corporate \nbond standards and regional bond market integration; and (iv) informing institutional investors of \nupdates in the bond market situation and initiatives undertaken to achieve an efficient bond \nmarket. Activities proposed under this TA will take into account those to be undertaken under \nproposed  TA  for  Minimizing  Foreign  Exchange  Settlement  Risk  in  the  ASEAN+3  Region: \nSupport for Group of Experts (GOE TA), which aims to harmonize standards and practices to \nfacilitate the settlement and clearance of bond transactions across the region.5 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will undertake the following activities under four components: \n13.  Component 1 will assess and harmonize bond standards in secondary government bond \nmarkets across the region. Activities will include \n(i)  assessing  policies,  standards,  and  practices  in  secondary  government  bond \nmarkets in selected ASEAN+3 countries (People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, \nJapan, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet \nNam) and proposing measures to harmonize them; \n(ii)  providing analyses of trading in secondary government bond markets and the \nmicrostructures of the markets, particularly regarding their trading platforms in \nthe ASEAN+3 countries; \n(iii)  preparing a strategy and/or road map to harmonize and integrate secondary \ngovernment  bond  markets  across  the  region,  taking  into  account  EU \nexperiences; \n(iv)  identifying financial laws and regulations relating to the cross-border trading of \ngovernment bonds through electronic trading systems;   \n(v)  providing analyses of laws and regulations on secondary government bonds \nacross the nine countries, particularly those on foreign investment and cross-\nborder trading through electronic trading systems;  \n                                                 \n4  The ABMI task force 3 focuses on (i) strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework for securities; (ii) \nfacilitating  collaboration  among  SROs  in  the  region;  (iii)  improving  bankruptcy  procedures  related  to  bond \ntransactions; and (iv) promoting the application of international accounting and auditing standards. \n5  ADB.

Component 2 will assess and harmonize corporate bond standards to facilitate the \ncross-border issuance of corporate bonds. Activities will include \n \n(i)  assessing policies and standards for regional access to corporate bond markets \nthrough public offerings and private placement, identifying standards and policies \nthat impede the development of domestic and cross-border bond issuance, and \nproviding analyses of recent market activities with respect to cross-border bond \nissuance in the region (e.g., issued amounts, issuers, currency of denomination, \nunderwriters, and investors); \n(ii)  identifying  potential  paths  toward  harmonizing  standards  and  integrating \ncorporate  bond  markets  in  the  selected  ASEAN+3  countries  based  on  EU \nexperiences;    \n(iii)  assessing the role of private placement in harmonizing and integrating corporate \nbond markets; \n(iv)  recommending  a  road  map  toward  harmonizing  standards  and  integrating \ncorporate  bond  markets  in  the  selected  ASEAN+3  countries  based  on  EU \nexperiences, taking into account activities to be undertaken under the GOE TA; \n(v)  identifying laws and regulations impeding the development of each market and, \nin  particular,  those  impeding  cross-border  trading  activities  and  foreign \ninvestment; and \n(vi)  providing  detailed  analyses  of  laws  and  regulations  on  cross-border  bond \nissuance in the nine countries, paying special attention to the private placement \nchannel.  \n \n15.  Component 3 will strengthen existing SROs and establish new ones to support the \nharmonization of corporate bond standards and regional bond market integration. Activities will \ninclude \n(i)  identifying major SROs in the region; \n(ii)  assessing and providing detailed analyses of bond standards established by \nSROs in the nine selected ASEAN+3 countries and recommending measures to \nharmonize them; \n(iii)  assessing and providing detailed analyses of major SROs in these countries \nbased on lessons from the EU; \n(iv)  recommending measures to strengthen SROs and, if necessary, establish new \nones  based  on  lessons  from  the  EU,  to  support  the  development  of  an \nintegrated bond market; and \n(v)  recommending an SRO model that can be adopted toward a market-driven \napproach to harmonizing Asian bond standards. \n \n16.  Component 4 will disseminate information to institutional investors in the bond market \nsituation and initiatives undertaken to achieve an efficient bond market. This outcome can be \nachieved through road show presentations, conferences, and forums. ", "      5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $950,000 equivalent.
