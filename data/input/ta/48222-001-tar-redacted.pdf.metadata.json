INTRODUCTION \n1.  A major challenge to enabling significant renewable energy deployment in India is the \nlack of long-term debt financing. On 30 October 2014, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \napproved a $500 million multitranche financing facility (MFF) for the Indian Renewable Energy \nDevelopment Agency (IREDA).1 The ADB financing has a tenor of up to 20 years and will \nsupport IREDA\u2019s subproject lending on a sustainable, long-term basis for biomass, cogeneration, \nhydro, solar, and wind power sources. As a commitment to IREDA during MFF processing, the \nGovernment of India requested capacity development technical assistance (TA) to complement \nimplementation of the ADB loans. During the TA fact-finding mission, the government concurred \nwith  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  and  financing \narrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Established in 1987 to promote renewable energy development in India, IREDA is a \nnonbank financial institution wholly owned by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy. \nIREDA has a unique market position given its government ownership and its capacity to provide \nlimited recourse, such as cash flow-based financing with tenors of up to 15 years, which many \nother financial institutions in India cannot easily match. This longer-term financing is to make a \nwider pool of renewable energy projects viable. In an effort to aggressively expand renewable \nenergy investment in India, on 5 November 2014 the cabinet approved an increase of IREDA\u2019s \nauthorized capital from $157 million to $943 million.  \n \n3.  IREDA borrows about 50% of its annual long-term funds from development agencies, \nsuch as ADB, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), the European Investment Bank, \nJapan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and German development cooperation through \nKfW.3 During 2014, IREDA signed loan agreements with three development partners: AFD for \n\u20ac100 million T(h$i1s1 i1n fmorimllioanti)o,n t hhea sE ubreoepne arenm Inovveesdt mase nitt  fBaallsn kw fiothri n\u20ac 2e0x0c empitliloionn  to($ d2i2s2c lomsiulliroen ),4 and \nJICA  for  \u00a53sp0e cbifiileliodn i n (p$a2r4a4g ramphill i9o7n )(.iv5)  Ionf  A2D0B1\u20194s,  PIuRbElicD CA omalmsou nsicigantioend  Pao licmy e(m20o1ra1n).d um  of \nunderstanding with the Export-Import Bank of the United States for $1 billion to finance the sale \nof American clean energy exports to India.6 Combined with the $500 million MFF from ADB, \nIREDA has already secured about $2.1 billion in 2015, meeting the $2.1 billion development \nassistance required for fiscal years 2014\u20132024.7 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to India for the Clean Energy Finance Investment Program. Manila (MFF 0087-IND, $500 million, \napproved on 30 October, to be closed on 29 October 2018.). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 June 2015. \n3  IREDA raises the other 20% of its annual funding from issuing long-term local currency bonds and the remaining \n30% from borrowing term loans from local financial institutions.  \n4  This information has been removed as it falls within exception to disclosure specified in paragraph 97 (iv) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communication Policy (2011). \n5  This information has been removed as it falls within exception to disclosure specified in paragraph 97 (iv) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communication Policy (2011). \n6  This information has been removed as it falls within exception to disclosure specified in paragraph 97 (iv) of ADB\u2019s \nPublic Communication Policy (2011). \n7  Per ADB staff estimation of IREDA\u2019s long-term funding projection, IREDA\u2019s total financing need is about $6.6 billion \nfor  FY2014\u2013FY2024,  including  $2.1  billion  from  development  assistance,  $1.6  billion  from  local  borrowing,  \n$1.9 billion from IREDA\u2019s net repayment, and $1.0 billion from IREDA\u2019s internal accruals and government equity \ncontribution (footnote 1).  \n ", "2  \n4.  IREDA\u2019s technical capacity is strong. It is proficient in sourcing, developing, evaluating, \nand  administering  renewable  energy  subprojects.  In  addition,  IREDA  is  compliant  with \napplicable local rules and regulations, including prudential norms stipulated by the Reserve \nBank of India. When undertaking development assistance, IREDA agreed to meet additional \ncompliance  requirements  proposed  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners,  such  as  \n(i)  environment  and  social  safeguards,  (ii)  project  administration  and  implementation,  and  \n(iii) operation and management, which often represent international best practice.  \n \n5.  In terms of subproject compliance with environment and social safeguards, IREDA has \nrelied largely on national and state legislation, which is not fully aligned with the ADB Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) and similar policies of AFD, JICA, and KfW. MFF implementation \nentails  many  administrative  requirements,  including  timely  preparation  and  submission  of  \n(i)  withdrawal  applications,  (ii)  liquidation  and  replenishment  requests  (under  the  imprest \naccount arrangement), (iii) project audit reports, (iv) project monitoring and review reports, and \n(v) other procedures as required by the ADB facility administration manual and environment and \nsocial management system. These procedures could be highly complex. IREDA\u2019s financial and \nrisk management practices, although in compliance with rules and regulations in India, do not \nmeet  certain  ADB  implementation  requirements.  This  TA  intends  to  improve  and  sustain \nIREDA\u2019s  capacity  in  these  areas  to  ensure  timely  and  effective  project  implementation, \nmonitoring and review, compliance, and closure. \n \n6.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, which includes promotion of renewable \nenergy to increase energy security and facilitate India\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy.8 It \nis  also  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2013\u20132017  for  India,  which \nemphasizes clean and renewable energy expansion, with expected installed and/or upgraded \ngenerating capacity of about 1.3 gigawatts of solar, hydro, and wind power.9 The TA underpins \nADB\u2019s long-term approach to establish a sustained partnership with IREDA to help it become a \nmore commercially oriented, competitive, profitable, and better performing nonbank financial \ninstitution in India dedicated to the promotion of renewable energy investment. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impacts the project is aligned with will be increased IREDA investment in clean and \nrenewable energy projects. The outcome will be that IREDA has increased capacity to utilize \nADB funds. By improving IREDA\u2019s operating capacity and compliance, IREDA is expected to \nmore efficiently and effectively mobilize available development assistance, catalyzing private \nsector investment and facilitating renewable energy development in India.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  IREDA  currently  implements  a  comprehensive  institutional  capacity  development \nprogram  supported  by  ADB,  AFD,  JICA,  and  KfW.  ADB  has  been  providing  consultant \nresources since July 2014 to help IREDA establish and operationalize an environment and \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

ADB has designed and will continuously coordinate and sequence its TA activities with \nreference to ongoing TA programs and their outputs from relevant development partners. In \nterms of output 1, during 2015\u20132017, ADB will provide training to the ESSU and technical \n(operations) staff on the application of the ADB environment and social management system, \nincluding  conducting  joint  field  visits  and  preparing  safeguard  due  diligence  reports  and \nsubproject  categorization.  ADB  will  also  provide  safeguard  training  based  on  JICA\u2019s \nimplementation experience and KfW\u2019s safeguard gap analysis. During 2017\u20132019, ADB will \nwork  with  IREDA  to  ensure  that  the  ESSU  can  effectively  address  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \nrequirements and the safeguard requirements of all relevant development partners. In terms of \noutput 2, the project administration consultant will train IREDA project management unit staff on \nADB processes by following the facility administration manual and legal agreements. In terms of \noutput 3, based largely on the results of the KfW financial and risk management assessment, \nthe strategy and financial management consultants will identify and design relevant areas of \nassistance for financial and risk management.  \n \n10.  ADB will integrate its TA work with the ongoing capacity-building projects of AFD, JICA, \nKfW, and any other relevant development partner in a coordinated, structured, and harmonized \nmanner during 2015\u20132019. The combined capacity-building efforts in principle will benefit all \ndevelopment partners with a business relationship with IREDA. \n \n11.  Lessons  from  a  1996  ADB  loan  to  IREDA  in  which  IREDA  financed  \n318 megawatts of cogeneration and wind generation capacity against a target of 125 megawatts \nwere incorporated in the 2014 ADB MFF loan (footnote 1).12 The 1996 loan leveraged additional \ninvestments up to 2.1 times, and is rated successful. The 1996 loan included advisory TA, \ncompleted in July 2001, to develop IREDA\u2019s technical, environmental, and other institutional \ncapacities. The TA completion report rates the advisory TA satisfactory.13 The lessons identified \nin the TA completion report were incorporated in this TA design by focusing on safeguards and \nfinancial and risk management, while collaborating closely with relevant development partners \non other areas of capacity building to avoid duplication of efforts. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund14 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nand administered by ADB. IREDA will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart \nstaff, office accommodation, office supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from  August  2015  to  December  2019.  IREDA  is  the \nexecuting agency; it is also the executing agency of the ADB MFF.
