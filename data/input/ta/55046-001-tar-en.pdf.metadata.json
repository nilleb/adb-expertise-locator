INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the understanding and \nuse of climate financing to promote sustainable low-carbon development in Hainan Province, \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in line with the objectives of the PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year \nPlan, 2021\u20132025, which targets an 18% reduction in carbon dioxide intensity and a 13.5% \nreduction in energy intensity during 2021\u20132025.1 The TA project will support a key strategic pillar \nof  Strategy  2030  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\u2014tackling  climate  change\u2014by \naccelerating development with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.2 The project will also \ncontribute to Sustainable Development Goal 13 on taking urgent action to combat climate change. \nThe TA will provide technical expertise to scale up climate financing in Hainan Province; help \nidentify a pilot clean energy project with low or near-zero emissions; and build capacity of the \nHainan provincial government to develop policies and measures that promote climate change \nmitigation and adaptation.3 \n \n2.  During the 2020 country programming mission, the Government of the PRC and ADB \nagreed to implement a TA project in climate finance to support Hainan. The TA is in line with \nADB's country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2021\u20132025, which prioritizes managing climate \nchange and supports government efforts to achieve high-quality green development through \ninvestments and knowledge solutions focusing on environmentally sustainable development and \nclimate change adaptation and mitigation.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC aims to address climate change, including establishing targets to peak carbon \nemissions before 2030, contributing to the 2015 Paris Agreement objectives. In 2006, the central \ngovernment introduced low-carbon city development as a national strategy, and since then local \ngovernments have been undertaking initiatives to reduce GHG emissions, tackle climate change, \nand move toward sustainable development. \n4.  In August 2010, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) launched a \npilot program for national low-carbon province and city development. 5 NDRC assigned 36 cities \nas pilot low-carbon cities, and six provinces, including Hainan Province, as pilot low-carbon \nprovinces. Selected provinces and cities were required to incorporate climate change into their \nlocal five-year plans and formulate specific low-carbon development plans, including in the \nfollowing areas: (i) developing low-carbon urban planning incorporating economic structural \nchanges, low-carbon energy mix, and energy conservation considerations; (ii) establishing low-\ncarbon  policies to  encourage energy conservation  and renewable energy;  (iii) accelerating \ninnovation and research and development for low-carbon industries; (iv) establishing GHG \ndatabase and management systems; and (v) encouraging green lifestyle changes. The goal of \nthese pilots was to test low-carbon policies and technologies and provide experience and lessons \nfor future initiatives in other cities and provinces. \n \n1  Government of the PRC. 2021.

Country  Partnership  Strategy:  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  2021\u20132025\u2014Toward  High-Quality,  Green \nDevelopment. \n5  The NDRC launched the first batch of low carbon province and low carbon city pilots in 2010, and the second batch \nin 2012. Hainan was included in the second batch. \n ", "2 \n5.  The island province of Hainan is the PRC's southernmost province. It features a rapidly \ngrowing economy that relies heavily on international and domestic tourism.6 The services sector \naccounts for 60% of Hainan's economic output, building on revenues generated by more than \n64 million visitors per year. Hainan was designated a free trade port in 2020. The rapid growth of \nHainan's economy and population is creating increased demand for energy. The province relies \nmainly on nonrenewable energy sources such as coal and nuclear power. Nevertheless, only \n42% of Hainan\u2019s power generation is fossil fuel based, and its GHG emissions are the lowest in \nthe country. \n \n6.  Green growth based on low-carbon objectives and clean technologies is a fundamental \ncomponent of Hainan's economic development strategy. The provincial government is exploring \npilot projects to develop low-carbon cities and near-zero carbon emission demonstration zones. \nA national government plan to implement an ecological civilization pilot zone in Hainan Province \nfrom 2019 will promote the green and sustainable development of the province.7 Key targets of \nthe plan include reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions to below 2015 \nlevels,  and  increasing  clean  energy's  share  to  83%  of  installed  capacity  over  by  2025.8 \nDevelopment of clean energy in Hainan is closely related to the PRC's government overall \nstrategy of (i) building a clean, low-carbon, safe, and efficient energy system; and (ii) peaking \ncarbon emissions before 2030. \n \n7.  Addressing climate change and pursuing low-carbon economic development have created \nnew challenges related to managing and using the fiscal revenues of local governments and \nattracting private investments, particularly from commercial funding sources. Further work is \nneeded to: (i) identify financing needs and bottlenecks in low-carbon sectors; (ii) analyze the \nstructure and form of financing mechanisms for low-carbon financing; (iii) determine the roles that \nthe private sector and public sector (both central and local governments) should play in low-\ncarbon financing; and (iv) identify policies, incentive mechanisms, and investment frameworks \nthat the government should adopt to attract more investment and private sector participation in \nlow-carbon sectors. \n \n8.  In October 2020, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, together with other national \nagencies, launched a guidance document to promote climate investment and finance in the PRC \nto  actively  address  climate  change, 9  and  promote  the  country\u2019s  nationally  determined \ncontributions as part of the country\u2019s commitment to the Paris Agreement.10 This TA project will \nsupport the government\u2019s objective to promote and enhance climate investment by: (i) improving \nthe enabling environment, knowledge, and skills of local governments and the private sector to \n \n6  The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025 projects Hainan\u2019s gross domestic product to grow at an average annual \nrate of 12%.  \n7  Government of the PRC. 12 May 2019.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA contributes to and is aligned with the following impacts: (i) investment and finance \nactivities that better serve low-carbon development goals in the PRC promoted (footnote 9); and \n(ii) peaking carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060 in the PRC achieved \n(footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: climate financing strategy for catalyzing \nprivate sector investment improved. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Roadmap for creating enabling policies and regulations and institutional \nmechanisms for scaling up climate finance developed. Output 1 will comprise: (i) a review of \nthe current climate financing environment in Hainan, including the legal and regulatory framework, \nand assessment of climate financing gaps and needs to achieve the province\u2019s climate change \ngoals\u2014including debt instruments linked to sustainability, blended finance, investment funds, and \nrisk-sharing instruments; (ii) consultations and roundtable discussions with public and private \nstakeholders on the challenges and opportunities of introducing climate financing; and (iii) \ndevelopment of a roadmap, based on best international practices, that includes action plans and \nguidance on enabling policies, regulations, institutional mechanisms, and incentives (e.g., tax \nincentives and credit enhancements to reduce costs and risks) for the provincial government to \nscale up climate financing of low-carbon projects in Hainan. \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity for project development and investment in low-carbon, climate-\nresilient  infrastructure  strengthened.  The  TA  will  support  capacity  and  knowledge \nstrengthening of the Hainan provincial government and other relevant agencies and institutions. \nActivities under this output will include multistakeholder consultations and workshops on climate \nfinance.  Specifically,  these  capacity  building  activities  will  help  build  the  Hainan  provincial \ngovernment's knowledge and technical capacity to develop projects and prepare proposals to \nattract funding and investment from both the public and private sectors. \n \n12.  Output 3: Pilot climate finance project on low-carbon technologies identified. Under \nthis output the TA team will (i) analyze and prescreen a list of potential clean energy projects of \nthe Hainan provincial government (projects must support local and regional socioeconomic \ngrowth, with low- or near-zero net carbon emissions; fossil fuel-related efficiency improvement \nprojects will be excluded); (ii) identify at least one pilot clean energy project based on climate \nchange mitigation/adaptation criteria and other sustainability factors; and (iii) conduct a pre-\nfeasibility study on the identified project, and recommend climate financing solutions to meet \nproject financing needs, with a focus on catalyzing private investment. \n \n13.  ADB will add value by supporting the Hainan provincial government to create an enabling \nenvironment  consistent  with  international  best  practices  that  will  facilitate  climate  finance \ninvestments. This is aligned with the country knowledge plan outlined in the country partnership \nstrategy 2021\u25002025. The TA will support the Hainan Department of Ecology and Environment, \nas  the  executing  agency,  in:  (i)  scaling  up  low-carbon  or  carbon-neutral  projects  through \nincreased climate financing, (ii) strengthening its institutional capacity, and (iii) catalyzing private \n ", "4 \nsector participation in low-carbon investments. Although the TA design does not feature direct \ngender components, it mandates at least 30% female participation in the workshops. \n \n14.  The key lessons and findings of the TA project will be disseminated through progress \nreports, workshops, conferences, and knowledge products. The executing agency and ADB will \ncoordinate  dissemination  of  the  knowledge  products  through  workshops,  capacity  building \nactivities, and/or other awareness-raising activities. Target audiences for the knowledge products \nwill include Hainan provincial government agencies, the private sector, and other stakeholders. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $420,000, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), and (ii) $100,000 will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund.11 \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, documents, and information relevant to the implementation of \nthe TA, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government contribution is estimated to \naccount for 5% of the total TA cost. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA.  The  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Division  and  the  Public \nManagement,  Financial  Sector,  and  Regional  Cooperation  Division  of  ADB's  East  Asia \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and monitor the progress and quality \nof work deliverables.
