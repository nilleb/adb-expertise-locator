The Prolect The proposed Project is designed to improve the\nsocioeconomic status of women through provision\nof social preparation and skills training, institutional\nsupport to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\nand provision of credit to women. The Project area\nwill cover 12 districts and five towns in Nepal.\n3. Classification The primary objective of the Project will be women\nin development, with poverty reduction and human\nresource development as secondary objectives.\n4. Rationale : Women in Nepal are among the poorest, yet they\nprovide over half of the labor force in the agriculture\nsector. Although, during the last ten years, a\nnumber of externally financed projects have been\nimplemented by the Government to address\nspecific needs and constraints facing women,\nsignificant numbers of women have remained\noutside the benefit stream. Given the enormity of\nthe physical and financial constraints facing the\nGovernment, it is unlikely that public sector services\nalone will ever be able to service the needs of\nsignificant proportions of society. It is therefore\nnecessary and appropriate to try new ways of\nreaching women by promoting genuine and\naccelerated NGO participation in development. The\nGovernment has indicated its intention to develop\na favorable climate for NGO development and to\nencourage private sector community development\nand credit support services by involving NGOs.\nThe Project is designed to serve initially as a pilot\nprogram to develop alternative mechanisms for\ndelivery and recovery of microcredit involving\nNGOs, and to ensure that proven strategies are\nsubsequently introduced on a regional and national\nscale. This innovative approach is expected to\nhave significant impacts on family income and\nemployment creation among a large number of\nwomen.\n5. Obiectives and Scope : The overall goal of the Project is to improve the\nsocioeconomic status of women in Nepal and\npromote their participation and integration in", "(iii)\nnational development, thereby contributing towards\npoverty reduction. In ord.er to contribute to this\nsectoral goal, the objective of the Project will be to\nimprove income and employment of poor women\nin selected rural and urban areas. The main\ncomponents of the Project are:\n(i) Group Formation and Training of Women\nBeneficiaries: (a) social preparation and\nskills training of women beneficiaries so as\nto equip them to undertake income-\ngenerating activities and small enterprises\nand/or to gain remunerative employment,\nand (b) rehabilitation and improvement of\nthe existing Women Training Centers and\nthe Training Materials Production Center to\nsupport staff and beneficiary training efforts.\n(ii) Institutional Support to NGOs, including\nsurveys of NGOs; support for staff training;\nstrengthening of management, accounting\nand reporting functions; and development of\nexpertise to enable NGOs to act as effective\nfinancial intermediaries.\n(iii) Provision of Credit to Women, who have\nreceived appropriate skills training for\nagricultural production, micro-enterprises\nand small business creation.\n\t\n6. Bank Financing (I) $5.0 million from the Bank's Special Funds\nresources to finance the costs of credit and\nrehabilitation of training facilities; the loan\ncarries a service charge of 1 per cent per\nannum and an amortization of 40 years\nincluding a grace period of 10 years;\n(ii)\t $0.9 million from the Japan Special Fund\n(JSF) to finance the costs of the group\nformation and training component on a\ngrant basis\n\t\n7 Other Source of Financing $2.0 million from the Government of Norway to\nfinance the costs of institutional support to NGOs\non a grant basis.\n\t\n8 Period of Utilization Until 30 June 2000", "\t\t\t\t\t\n(iv)\n9.\t Cost Estimates\n(in $'OOO)\nComponent\t FX\t LC\t Total\n1.

PBs and\nNGOs will onlend the proceeds of the loans,\ntogether with their own funds, to women\nbeneficiaries at a minimum of 17 per cent per\nannum, which is the prevailing commercial bank\nlending rate in Nepal.\n11. Executing Agencies : WOO under MLD will be the Executing Agency for\nthe group formation and training of women\nbeneficiaries and NGO institutional support\ncomponents of the Project, while the Nepal Rastra\nBank (Central Bank of Nepal or NRB) will be the\nExecuting Agency for the credit component.\n12. Implementation Arrangements: WDD will be responsible for day-to-day\nmanagement and implementation of the Project\nwith NRB implementing the credit component.\nSelected NGOs will assist WDD in implementing the\ngroup formation and training of women\nbeneficiaries. Beneficiaries will be given skills\ntraining in cooperation with Government line\ndepartments and other projects offering specific\nskills training. The Project will make available credit\nonly to beneficiaries who have received appropriate\nskills training. Under the Project, there will be two\nmechanisms for credit delivery and recovery. In the\nfirst mechanism (called Model A), NAB will relend\npart of Bank loan proceeds to the participating\nbanks (Rastriya Banijya Bank and Nepal Bank Ltd.),\nwhich will onlend directly to women beneficiaries.\nIn the second mechanism (called Model B), NRB\nwill relend a portion of the loan proceeds to NGOs\nfor onlending to women beneficiaries where NGOs\nare willing and are experienced in fulfilling the\nfinancial services function. During the first three\nyears of Project implementation, the Project will\nfocus on strengthening NGOs and, with respect to\ncredit, will use the PBs as financial intermediaries\n(Model A). After a comprehensive review of the\nProject at the end of the third year, the Government\nand the Bank will decide on whether to utilize\nModel B in addition to Model A. The strengthening\nof local NGOs will be carried out by the NGO\nSupport Unit within WDD, comprising domestic and\ninternational consultants. The Project activities will\nbe coordinated by the Project Implementation\nCommittee (PlC) at the central level, and by the", "(vi)\nWomen Development Officers of WDD at the district\nlevel. The PlC will be headed by a Project Director\nwho is the Joint Secretary of MLD in-charge of\nWDD.\n13. Procurement : Procurement of goods and services under the\ncredit component will be done according to normal\ncommercial procedures through direct purchase by\nthe sub-borrowers. Equipment and vehicles\nrequired by the Project will be procured mainly on\nthe basis of international shopping, and in some\ncases through direct purchase. The civil works\nrelated to the rehabilitation and improvement of the\ntraining centers will be carried out on the basis of\nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to\nthe Bank. The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement\nwill be used in the procurement of civil works and\nequipment.\n14. Consultant Services : Two groups of consultants will be required by the\nProject: (I) 132 person-months of consultant\nservices from individual sources to assist WDD in\nthe implementation of group formation and training\nof women beneficiaries. The cost of these\nconsultant services will be financed from JSF on a\ngrant basis; (ii) 156 person-months of consultant\nservices from suitably qualified firms to assist WDD\nin the implementation of institutional support to\nNGO component. These consultant services will be\nfinanced by the Government of Norway on a grant\nbasis. All the consultants will be engaged in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n\t\nI1 Estimated Project\n\t\nCompletion Date 31 December 1999\n16. Proiect Benefits and\nBeneficiaries About 20,000 women will be benefited from the\nskills training component, of whom 10,500 will\nreceive agricultural production credit; 3,000, micro-\nenterprise credit; and about 300, small business\nformation credit. The other women beneficiaries\nare expected to rely on their own savings or to\nobtain credit from other sources. The Project will\nhave a direct impact on developing effective\nsystems to promote coordinated public/private\nsector services, which in turn will generate\nexpanded production of foodgrai ns, vegetables and", "(vii)\nlivestock products; and promote cottage and agro-\nindustries production, and self-reliance among\nwomen. The new jobs created under the Project\nare estimated at 24,800 person-years. FIRRs for\ntypical subprojects range from 24 to 61 per cent.\n17. Technical Assistance : Technical Assistance (TA) for Group Formation and\nTraining of Women Beneficiaries accompanies the\nproposed loan. This TA will be financed from JSF\non a grant basis in the amount of $0.9 million. The\nprovision of skills training under the TA is closely\nlinked to the provision of credit under the Project.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t 8\u00b0N\n82\u00b0N\nNEPAL\n\u2014\t MICROCREDIT PROJECT FOR WOMEN\nFAR WESTERN ,\\\t 1\nREGION\t c\n1\t Humla\t ..\n30\u00b0E\t 7\n,'\t\nMID WESTERN\nDarctrula\t )\t //\t REGION\n/\t I\t\nBajhang ,.'\t /.\u2022\t 5,_\nMugs\t\nBaitadi\t ).\t\t '\t BaJra\t -y/)\n(\t - 1..-,\t-\t -\t\nII\t /\n-\t -.\nDadeidhura ..\t (\t Jumla\t /\n.-'\t Doti\t\nAchharn ) Kakot \\\t Dolpa\t )\nJ Mueang \u2022,\n(\t \t WESTERN\nKancharc,ur (\t Daitekh\t Jajarkot .\t I\t . ...-'\t REGION\n(\t 1\n'S'\t I\t Karlal\t .\t Rukurn\t Manang\t '\n\t / 'S\t -\n\u2022; S \\.\t /\t 'N\t Sutkhet\t 5,,\t Myagdu\t -.\t --\n\"I\t B d\t'\t /\t '-\"\\\t RolPa\t \u2014\t -\t L\t Kki\t Lamjurrg\t Gorinha\t CREENGTIROANL\n\tBae/\t \t (\t /\t .\t -\t -\t i\tbI :i\t f\t ----,.----,\t'I\t1\t /\t Rasuw-a-----\t N\t .

INTRODUCTION\n2. In January 1991 the Government of Nepal requested Bank financial assistance\nfor implementing a women in development (WID) project as part of its overall strategy to reduce\npoverty and promote sustainable development in the country. In March 1991 the Bank sent a\nReconnaissance Mission to assess the potential for a WID Project and to evaluate the\nimplementation capacities of the agencies in charge of development of women. The Mission\nwas assisted by two staff consultants, who continued the assessment until May 1991. Following\nthe completion of the study, the Bank fielded a loan Fact-Finding Mission in June 1991 and a\nFollow-Up Mission in September-November 1991, which had detailed discussions with the\nGovernment, the various aid agencies and a number of non-government organizations (NGOs)\nwith regard to the objectives, scope, financing plan and implementation arrangements of the\nproposed Project. After the priority of the Project was reconfirmed by the Government in early\n1992, and at the request of the Government, a Bank Appraisal Mission!' visited Nepal from 22\nMarch to 7 April 1992. After co-financing arrangements with the Norwegian Government had\nbeen firmed up by the Bank in October 1992, further consultations were carried out by the\nAppraisal Mission with the Government, the aid agencies, and NGOs during November 1992-\nFebruary 1993 to improve the Project design and implementation. This Report is based on the\nAppraisal Mission's review of the various reports on WID and NGOs in Nepal, its findings in the\nfield, and its discussions with Government officials and representatives of the external financing\nagencies and NGOs in Nepal.\nIll. BACKGROUND\nA.\t Women in Development\nRural Poverty\n3. In comparative terms, Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. It ranks\n117th in per capita gross national product (estimated at $180 in 1989 US dollars) among 124\ncountries listed in the 1991 World Development Report (World Bank). A similar picture emerges\nfrom a comparison of other economic and social indicators as well. Nepal's infant mortality rate,\nThe Mission consisted of D. Nangju (Senior Agronomist/Mission Chief), Y. Uehara\n(Project Specialist, WID), K Tsubota (Project Economist), P. Daltrop (Counsel), Z.\nRachman (Programs Officer), D. Baillie (Institutional Development Specialist/Staff\nConsultant) and F. Bennett (Microcredit Specialist/Staff Consultant). Representatives of\nthe Norwegian Government and the United Nations Development Fund for Women\n(UNIFEM), who are expected to co-finance the Project, also participated in the Mission.\nA. Kaukinen (Project Specialist, SDU) assisted the Follow-up Appraisal Mission on a part-\ntime basis.", "2\nfor example, is the highest in the South Asian region and higher than the average for all low-\nincome countries.\n4. Poverty is both extreme and widespread in Nepal. There is an absolute shortage\nof food at both the household and national levels. Average per capita availability of food is only\nabout 90 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement, and is much lower for those below the\npoverty line. Malnutrition is therefore widespread among women and children. While health\nservices have improved significantly over the past two decades, most people still do not have\naccess to organized medical care. About 40 per cent of the population is in absolute poverty,\nof which 48 per cent are in the Terai1' and 52 per cent in the Hills. About 94 per cent of the\ncountry's poor live in rural areas. The poor are overwhelmingly subsistence farmers. They\ngenerate about half their incomes from their own agricultural production, almost none of which\nis marketed. They earn less than 30 per cent of their income from employment, mostly on-farm,\ngetting the remainder from miscellaneous subsistence activities.\n5. The combination of very low average income levels and fairly uniform distribution\nof income suggests that the basic cause of poverty in Nepal is excessive population\nconcentrated on an insufficient economic base, rather than an unequal distribution of available\nwealth. The high annual population growth of 2.7 per cent in 1971-1980, and 2.1 per cent in\n1981-1990 has eroded the limited gains that have been made in gross domestic product (GDP)\nand food production. Continued and widespread poverty is primarily the result of insufficient\ngrowth in the economy, which is agriculture-based. Rural poverty is the outcome of an\naggregate deficiency in productive resources, principally land. Net cultivated land represents\nonly 20 per cent of land area, with very limited scope for expansion. Off-farm employment\nopportunities are severely limited and, therefore, an increasingly large number of people have\nto be absorbed by the agriculture sector. As a result, the size of average landholding of rural\nhouseholds continues to decline.\n2.\t Socioeconomic Status of Women\n6. Women in Nepal comprise about 48 per cent of the total population, Of whom 35\nper cent are economically active (National Planning Commission, 1981  ).a1 Within the overall\neconomy, more than 95 per cent of economically active females are engaged in agricultural\nwork. Their life expectancy of 52 years is among the lowest in the world. Among the poor,\nwomen constitute the most disadvantaged persons in the society. Apart from sociocultural\nfactors that have traditionally hindered the improvement of women's socioeconomic status, three\nmajor constraints may be identified: (i) limited access to education, (ii) limited access to\nproductive resources, and (iii) scarcity of time to undertake remunerative work.\n7. Women's limited access to education has been a major obstacle adversely\ninfluencing their economic participation and upward mobility. The female literacy rate of 12 per\ncent in Nepal (based on 1981 census) is one of the lowest in Asia. Girls constitute only about\nThe Terai is an ecological zone located in the southern part of the country and is an\nextension of the Indo-Gangetic plain.\nConventional statistics often do not reflect women's actual contribution to the economy,\nparticularly in indirect and nonmonetized forms.", "3\n35 per cent of the total enrollment at the primary level (6-10 years), 29 per cent in lower\nsecondary (11-12 years) and 27 per cent at the upper secondary level (13-15 years))' The\nmajority of these pupils live in the urban areas. Their school drop-out rate is also very high,\npartly because of heavy involvement in domestic chores and routine farm work. Lack of basic\neducation remains one of the principal causes of women's inaccessibility to new skills.\n8. Women also lack access to productive resources. Since almost all property\nincluding houses, land, animals and equipment is inherited patrilineally, women cannot own\nproperty in their own names except daijo - property given to a woman by her natal household\nat marriage -- and pewa - anything given to a woman as personal property or anything bought\nfrom earning. Moreover, women's lack of assets also results in their limited access to\ninformation, modern technology and financial services, especially credit.\n9. Women in Nepal are also among the most disadvantaged. Generally, they work\nconsiderably harder and longer than men and yet have only marginal control over the meager\nfinancial resources of the family. They carry out almost the entire load of domestic work\nincluding fetching water and carrying fuelwood. In addition, they provide about half of\nagricultural labor requirements. Overall, according to some estimates, a woman's work burden\n(at home and outside) is about 44 per cent greater than that of a man (10.8 hours as against\n7.5 hours).'\n10. There is great variation in the practical application of these factors from one ethnic\ngroup to another. Nepalese people can be broadly categorized into Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-\nBurmen, but there are many other small ethnic groups in which the status and position of\nwomen vary considerably. Autonomy of women is highest among nondichotomous\ncommunities, where a value is placed on female entrepreneurship (craft production and sale,\nmarketing and trading, etc.). In such communities, women contribute as much as 68 per cent\nof the local and expanded market economy and \u2022participate in major decision making at the\nhousehold level. However, in dichotomous communities, female entrepreneurship and\nmarketing activity are considered degrading, with the result that women are confined to the\ndomestic sphere. Women's participation in the market economy remains closely correlated with\ntheir socioeconomic status.a'\n11. However, a recent field survey shows that women, especially those who earn\ncash income, have been actively participating in decision making regarding various household\nmatters. The survey also reveals that most women participating in various aid-assisted\nprograms make the major household decisions concerning purchase of basic family needs such\nas food, clothing, education of the children, and provision of fodder requirements.\n12. Despite the constraints affecting women's socioeconomic status, it has been well\nrecognized that the promotion of women's cash income-earning abilities will potentially have a\nmajor impact on family well-being. This is because (i) women undertake a very large share of\nMinistry of Education and Culture, 1989.\nCenter for Economic Development and Administration, Nepal, The Status of Women in\nNepal, 1981.\nTA No. 5248-REG: Role of Women in Rural Industries, Final Report, 1988.", "4\nhousehold agricultural production; (ii) they exercise considerable control and influence over\nwhat they perform and produce within the household economy; and (iii) as primary caretakers\nof households, women are major change agents in health, nutrition, sanitation and family\nplanning. Experience reveals that some of the greatest impacts among the poor can be\nachieved by placing more income in the hands of women. Thus, a focus on women in the\ndevelopment process is seen to be especially important in relation to poverty reduction and is\nconsidered to be crucial in achieving overall viability of most development programs.!'\n3.\t Constraints in the Delivety of Microcredit to the Poor\n13. To improve the socioeconomic status of women, they must be provided with\nresources (e.g., credit) and services (e.g., skills training). At present, institutional credit to both\nmen and women accounts for only about 20 per cent of total borrowing on average, the\nremainder coming from moneylenders, friends and relatives or other non-institutional sources.\nLess than 10 per cent of this institutional credit goes to the poor.\n14. The Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) Program, launched by the\nWomen Development Division under the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) in 1982, alms at\nimproving the quality of life of rural women with per capita income below the poverty line.\nPCRW started as a small-scale credit program for women to engage in agricultural production\nand micro-enterprises, with provision of ancillary community development and skills training\nservices; it has now been effectively linked with literacy improvement, community development,\nand maternal and child health care activities covering 35 districts. The program is presently\nfinanced by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Children's\nFund (UNICEF), Finnish International Development Assistance Agency (FINNIDA) and United\nNations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). Under the program, the credit is provided by\nthe Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) and the two Government-owned\ncommercial banks, the Nepal Bank Ltd. (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB). PCRW is a\ngood model for improving the socioeconomic status of women, but loan disbursement under\nit has been slow, and the coverage of the program has been confined to a few villages in each\nof the program districts. To improve loan disbursements and to expand the coverage of the\nprogram in the districts, under the Eighth Five-Year Development Plan (1992/93 - 1997/98) the\nGovernment has decided to involve local NGOs in providing financial and support services.\n15. Mechanisms for delivery of microcredit to the poor in Nepal are currently\nconstrained by (i) high administrative and supervisory costs of servicing small loans in difficult\nterrain; (ii) poor recoveries; (iii) inadequate interest spreads to cover the high cost of delivery;\n(iv) the lack of qualified and motivated staff; (v) inappropriate modalities/systems: and (vi) time-\nconsuming formalities and procedures, and resulting high borrower transaction costs. In spite\nof Government incentives and regulations, commercial banks are still hesitant to participate in\nthe lending programs to priority sectors (e.g., agriculture). People below the poverty line,\nespecially women, are not well served by the \u00f4ommerciai banking system. The present\nmodalities for delivery of credit to the poor, including women, are not effective.\nWorld Bank, Nepal: Poverty and Income, 1991.", "5\n16. Experience in Bangladesh, Philippines and Sri Lanka indicates that the problems\nof providing credit to women can be effectively addressed through NGOs as financial\nintermediaries. The grassroots nature of local NGOs ensures close contact with beneficiaries,\nwhich reduces borrower transaction costs and improves recovery. Local NGOs are generally\nnoted for their low-cost operations because of their small overhead expenditure and nonprofit\norientation. Thus, it would be appropriate to focus on the development of alternative\nmechanisms for delivery of financial services involving NGOs.\n4.\t Constraints and Potential of NGOs\n17. Although national and international NGOs have been operating in Nepal since the\nearly 1 950s, they have recently, with Government encouragement, proliferated. The emergence\nof a democratic government in 1991 encouraged NGO activities at the grassroots as well as\nnational levels. During 1984-1992, the number of national NGOs operating in Nepal in a formal\ncapacity increased from 115 to 545. This number does not include around 200 NGOs that are\nnot registered with the Social Service National Coordination Council (SSNCC), now called the\nSocial Welfare Council (SWC). In terms of geographical distribution, about 63 per cent of NGOs\nare concentrated in the Central Development Region (about 40 per cent in Kathmandu alone),\n13 per cent in the Western Region, 8 per cent in the Eastern Region, 4 per cent in the Mid-\nWestern Region and 2 per cent in the Far Western Region.\n18. During the same period, the number of international NGOs (INGOs) in Nepal\nincreased from 5 to 70. INGOs have been operating assistance programs linked wherever\nfeasible to district and village NGOs and/or established self-help groups. Largely because of\nthe rigid controls previously placed on sociopolitical activities in rural areas, bilateral and\nmultilateral agencies and INGO liaison activities were mostly confined to the capital. This has\nled to the formation of a strong Kathrnandu-based group of about 50 nonprofit private research\nand development organizations (PRDO5)!' and professional NGOs (PNGO).' Most of them\noperate area-specific village and district services and development programs where new\nconcepts of integrated village and NGO cooperation are being developed. Specific target\ngroups chosen by INGOs and national NGOs vary in accordance with actual services offered.\n19. As most NGOs in Nepal have been in operation for a relatively short period, their\nsmall size and lack of efficient management and direction constitute their most critical\nconstraints. At the district level, geographical isolation severely limits local NGO access to\nKathmandu-based TA services and to INGOs and potential sources of financing.\n20. The main strength of local NGOs in Nepal is that about 20 per cent of the formally\nestablished NGOs have been in operation for the last 10 years doing work similar to that\nrequired under the Project; they have already demonstrated the potential to expand their\nactivities and services among the community as a whole provided they can be assisted in\nstrengthening their managerial and operational competence. In addition, many financial self-\nPRDOs are organizations principally handling socioeconomic study programs.\nai\t\nPNGOs are organizations whose activities center almost entirely on the provision of\nbeneficiary training and support services.", "6\nhelp groups of local origin exist in various parts of Nepal..\" They play important roles as local\nfinancial intermediaries by mobilizing savings and providing credit. They may greatly improve\ntheir performance if they establish linkages with banks for mutually beneficial business relations\nand are provided with TA for making them viable NGOs3'\n21. Although it is recognized that some NGOs are being established partly in an effort\nto tap the ever-increasing potential sources of external, financing, an essential foundation of\ngenuine NGOs is already in existence, and many more NGOs are capable of providing rural and\nurban assistance for grassroots level development. Further institutional strengthening support\nprovided to NGOs at this stage will almost certainly act as a catalyst to accelerate their real\ninvolvement in community development.\n5.\t Sector Institutions\n22. The responsibility for WID in Nepal is at present divided between two line\nministries: the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) and MLD. Six other ministries\n(Health, Education and Culture, Agriculture, Forestry and Environment, Water Resources and\nIndustry) also retain small Women Liaison Units, each staffed by a single officer. Both MLSW\nand MLD retained separate Women Development Divisions (WDDs) while MLD also operates\nWomen Training Centers (WTCs) and a Training Materials Production Center (TMPC) within its\nDecentralization and Training Division.\n23. The major functions of WDD/MLSW are to oversee national level policies and\nprograms on WID, to collect and disseminate information and data on women, and to organize\nan interministerial coordination committee to discuss WID-related activities at the sectoral level.\nHowever, this arrangement is not functioning, as the present administrative system remains\nindividual ministry-related and consequently does not foster close liaison.\n24. The most important WID agency in Nepal is WDD/MLD, which was established\nin 1980 to initiate specialist programs for WID activities at the village and district levels. Its\nprincipal objectives and functions are (i) to coordinate with other line agencies and ministries\nat the district level to ensure that women's needs are adequately covered in all field service and\ndevelopment programs, and (ii) to formulate and implement effective policies and specialist\nprograms for WID within individual districts. In practice, the Division is principally concerned\nwith the implementation of community development activities and PCRW in 35 districts. There\nare, however, a number of other smaller programs operated by WDD in 14 other districts.\nThese include participation in (i) minor women's program components of Integrated Rural\nDevelopment Projects (IRDP5) in 11 districts; (ii) Enhancing the Agricultural Production Capacity\nof Rural Women Project supported by FAO in three districts; (iii) the development and\nNepal Rastra Bank, Survey of Self-Help Groups, 1987.\nThis approach has been successfully applied under the Small Farmers Development\nProgram being implemented by the Agricultural Development Bank (ADBN) over the past\n15 years with assistance first from UNDP/FAO, then FAD and more recently the Bank\n[Loan No. 1 037-NEP(SF) for $30 million for the Third Small Farmers Development\nProject]. A variant of this approach is being adopted successfully under the ongoing\nBank-financed Irrigation Sector Project [Loan No. 923-NEP(SF)].", "management of village drinking water systems financed by bilateral agencies and international\nNGOs; (iv) liaison with women groups on maternal and child health and family planning\nprograms, supported by UNICEF and UNFPA; and (v) a variety of other social service programs\ngeared to awareness creation, functional literacy and leadership training.\n25. WDD/MLD is expanding its network of services at the district and village levels.\nIn March 1992, 49 districts were serviced by a field staff made up of both permanent and\ncontract personnel. WDD Headquarters in Kathmandu maintains direct linkages with district staff\non operational and policy-related matters. Women Development Officers (WDOs) at the district\nlevel are responsible for (I) supervising women workers (WWs) and other WDD staff in the field;\n(ii) coordinating with line departments and participating banks to provide technical support\nservices, training and credit; (iii) assisting in design and implementation of community\ndevelopment districts; and (iv) reporting, monitoring and evaluating projects. The WDOs are\nsupported by \\NWs at the village level, who maintain direct contact with the beneficiaries and\nremain at the village site. In each of the 49 districts, there are 1 WDO and 4-6 WWs. In some\ndistricts, the number of WWs has been increased to 6-13. WWs usually hold a school leaving\ncertificate and are recruited from the same or a nearby district. They are responsible for health,\nfamily planning, child care programs, community development activities, income-generating\nactivities, group formation, liaison with the banks involved in PCRW and supervision of local\nbeneficiary training. In addition, they conduct household surveys to identify beneficiaries and\ntargets for new initiatives in the expansion of the WID program.\n26. The major constraints of WDD/MLD are: (i) most WDOs who are responsible for\ncoordination of project activities are not located in the District Headquarters; (ii) field staff have\nexcessive responsibility for project implementation and are not adequately supervised and\nguided by the staff at the central level; (iii) there are few staff at the village level, many of whom\nare hired on a temporary/contract basis; and (iv) most WDOs and WWs do not have transport.\nBecause of these constraints, WID activities in the districts have remained in need of substantial\nexpansion. However, during recent years, the Government has taken concrete measures to\novercome the constraints (see para. 90).\nB.\t Government Policies and Plans\n1.\t Poverty Reduction\n27. The focus of past development policies, plans, strategies and projects has been\non economic growth. \"Trickle-down\" effects were implicitly assumed to help reduce poverty\nonce growth gained some momentum but adequate growth did not materialize. Therefore,\ndirect efforts to help the poor have increasingly featured in the formulation of the Government's\ndevelopment strategy. Poverty reduction was specified as a goal in itself in the Seventh Five-\nYear Development Plan (1985/86 -1990/91) and is included as one of the major objectives of the\nEighth Plan. The Government has indicated that poverty reduction programs in the Eighth Plan\nwill be devised and executed in a manner that will benefit the actual poor directly and indirectly.\nPolicies to be adopted by the Government during the Eighth Plan period include (I) simple\nmechanisms to identify backward areas and poor families and to ensure conformity in the\nexecution of sectoral programs, (ii) self-targeted and targeted programs for the poor, (iii)\nincreased accessibility of the poor to productive resources, and (iv) employment creation in the\nnon-agriculture sectors.", "8\n28. During the Eighth Plan period sectoral programs designed to reduce poverty\ninclude programs in health, education, family planning, irrigation development, community\nforestry, labor-intensive construction works, small farmers' development and PCRW. Additional\ninstitutional arrangements will be introduced to encourage private sector individuals and NGOs\nto implement poverty reduction programs.\n2.\t Women in Development\n29. The Government first adopted explicit policies to incorporate the role of women\nin development under the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (1980/81-1985/86). More specific\npolicy statements were also included in the Seventh Plan relating to the provision of additionaJ\nextension/training programs for women in the agriculture sector, the expansion of literacy\nprograms and the creation of additional employment opportunities in cottage industries.\n30. Under the Eighth Plan, the Government's WID policies have been outlined. These\ninclude (i) equal and meaningful participation of women in the development process; (ii) raising\nemployment opportunities for women in the economic and social sectors; (iii) expansion of\nwomen's access to credit, technical expertise, entrepreneurship training and market services;\n(iv) encouraging the appointment of women in the Government, semi-government and non-\ngovernment sectors; and (v) reform of laws and by-laws that hinder the development of women.\n31. In line with the Government's objectives to improve the socioeconomic conditions\nof the people in rural areas and to promote people's participation in rural development works,\nthe Government will launch special programs for women and will encourage NGOs to engage\nin programs that will benefit specific target groups. During 1992-1997, the WID program will be\nexpanded from 49 to 64 districts, about 7,900 women's credit groups will be formed to raise\nincomes through the provision of credit, about 40,000 families will benefit under the program,\nand the Local Development Training Program will be strengthened to provide training for both\nmen and women.\n3.\t Non-Governmental Organizations\n32. The Government has already published its Eighth Plan emphasizing an increased\nrole for the private sector and NGOs. The Government envisages an increased scope for the\nservices of NGOs in operating flexible, innovative and low-cost development services at the local\nlevel. This will motivate self-help participation and help create sustainable village support for\nmaintenance of essential services. Such assistance will enhance the principal aims of the Plan\nto enhance community participation, reduce poverty and promote balanced regional rural\ndevelopment.\n33. To encourage genuine and accelerated NGO participation in development, the\nGovernment formulated the Social Welfare Act, which was approved by Parliament in October\n1992. The Act seeks to simplify and better enforce NGO registration procedures, and to limit\nSWC powers to facilitating NGO/INGO/Government liaison, monitoring and evaluating\ndevelopment programs. However, since the Act does not include provision for regulating\nfinancial intermediation by NGOs, the Government has agreed to make the necessary legislative\nand/or regulatory changes to provide a more detailed framework to regulate the financial\nactivities of NGOs. At the rural level, the Government has recently enacted legislation to ensure", "9\nthat NGOs play a key role in planning and implementing village and area development activities\nassisted by the coordinated efforts of local administrative and elected officials.\n4.\t Credit Availability\n34. From the mid-i 980s Nepal has been implementing financial sector reforms aimed\nat increasing competition among financial institutions and financial instruments and at enlarging\nthe role of market forces. The scope of the reforms, supported by TA from the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was to\nremove controls on interest rates, improve financial instruments, strengthen financial institutions,\npromote indirect (non-administrative) instruments of monetary policy and improve surveillance\nof the banking system. The reforms have been successful in promoting financial intermediation\nand deepening the financial markets, as shown by the ratio of total liquidity of the banking\nsystem over GOP, which rose from 13 per cent in the mid-i 970s to 34 per cent at the end of the\n1980s.\n35. During the Eighth Plan period, growth in internal credit will be confined to an\nannual 14.3 per cent, and the flow of banking sector credit to the private sector will be increased\nby an annual 22.1 per cent. Since ADBN and the two Government-owned commercial banks\n(NBL and RBB) have continued to have performance problems, the three banks will make\nspecial efforts to recover outstanding loans as well as to manage bad debts as a means to\nimprove their collection rates. In addition, they have taken measures to (i) make necessary\nincreases in their capital; (ii) close loss-incurring branches; (iii) reduce excess staff; (iv) improve\ncredit processing, personnel development and management; and (v) stop provision of credit on\nGovernment guarantee. These measures are expected to improve their financial perfOrmance.\nThe Government is fully committed to improving the performance of the three banks in\nchannelling credit to the poor.\nC.\t External Assistance to the Sector\n36. Most foreign aid organizations working in Nepal have explicit policies to promote\nWID; many have been implementing programs and projects targeting women beneficiaries.\nThese programs and projects are executed by WDD/MLD. This sectoral focus of current\nexternal assistance coincides with the WID priorities of the Government's Seventh and Eighth.\nPlans.\n37. Within the agriculture sector, income generation and employment creation for\nwomen have been the major thrust of a number of aid agencies in the past decade. Generally,\nassistance is provided as a package of services encompassing (i) training for social preparation\nand increased awareness; (ii) community development services and subsequent skills training;\nand (iii) financial support in the form of credit in projects such as PCRW supported by UNICEF,\nUNFPA, FINNIDA, and IFAD; the Third Small Farmers Development Project (SFDP Ill) supported\nby the Bank1', and the IRDPs supported by the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the European\nLoan No. 1037-NEP(SF) for $30 million, approved in October 1990.", "10\nEconomic Communities (EEC), the Netherlands and German Technical Assistance Agency\n(GTZ) (see Appendix 1).\n38. In the past, Bank assistance for WID in Nepal focused on indirect support to\nwomen beneficiaries through agriculture sector projects and, to some extent, social\ninfrastructure projects in education and water supply. Recognizing that rural women lack access\nto extension services, improved technology and credit, attempts have been made to address\ndirectly the constraints facing women in developing their potential as agricultural producers. One\nof the earliest Bank-assisted WID programs was designed as part of the Seti Zone Integrated\nRural Development Project,1' under which a WTC was constructed in Dipayal, in the Far\nWestern Region. Under SFDP Ill, about $3.3 million was allocated for the exclusive use of\nwomen for income-generating activities, while under the Upper Sagarmatha Agricultural\nDevelopment Project, about $0.5 million was allocated for promoting community development\ntargetted to women beneficiaries. These projects are still under implementation.\nD.\t Lessons Learned\n39. In the preparation of the proposed Project, the Mission has incorporated lessons\nlearned from the completed PCRW (Phase I) and Second Small Farmers Development Project\n(SFDP II) financed by other agencies (mainly UNICEF, UNFPA and IFAD). An impact evaluation\nstudy of PCRW (Phase I) was carried out in 1989, while the PCR of SFDP ll was carried out\nby the Bank in 1992. The reports bring out the difficulty of implementing microcredit projects\ntargetting poor women, although the repayment rate was high (more than 90 per cent) and there\nwas a close linkage between income generating activities and social services/community\ndevelopment activities. Because of the rigidity of the participating banks and the weak\nimplementation of the executing agency, the coverage of the projects in the districts was small.\nThe lessons learned from these projects are: (I) the number of project components should be\nsmall and manageable; (ii) adequate numbers of field staff should be appointed and trained to\nsupervise project activities; (iii) the WDOs and other field staff should not be overburdened with\nimplementation responsibilities; (iv) field staff should be closely supervised by staff from the\nheadquarters; and (v) savings mobilization should be made an integral part of the credit\ncomponent to ensure that the beneficiaries will be able to repay their loans and achieve healthy,\nself-reliant enterprises.\n40. The number of components under the proposed Project has been limited to three\nso that the problem of coordination among the implementing agencies is minimized. The\ndistricts included in the Project area have been carefully chosen to ensure that there is already\nan adequate number of trained field staff (both WDOs and WWs) deployed in them. The field\nstaff will be provided with motorcycles or bicycles to improve their mobility. To reduce the\nworkload of field staff of WDD/MLD, the Government has agreed to involve selected NGOs in\nLoan No. 748-NEP(SF), approved in October 1985.\nLoan No. 1114-NEP(SF), approved in October 1991.\nCenter for Economic Development and Administration, Production Credit for Rural\nWomen - An Impact Evaluation Study. Kathmandu, Nepal, 1989.\nProject Completion Report of the Second Small Farmer Development Project (Loan No.\n166-NE), July 1992.", "11\nProject implementation. The Government has also agreed to appoint additional experienced\nfield officers as program officers to be based in Kathmandu; the program officers will supervise\nand provide technical support to field staff of WDD through regular and more frequent visits to\nthe Project areas. The credit provision under the proposed Project will be linked to a savings\nmobilization program among the women beneficiaries.\nE.\t The Bank's Sectoral Strategy\n41. The principal strategic objective for Bank operations in Nepal is poverty reduction.\nThis is consistent with the Government's own development strategy enunciated in the Eighth\nPlan. Income distribution in Nepal is fairly egalitarian. A major policy implication is that there\nis little scope for poverty reduction through income and asset redistribution. Therefore, the\nBank's operational strategy in Nepal in the near-to-medium term will focus on poverty reduction\nthrough broad-based, labor-absorbing economic growth.!' Since agriculture is the backbone\nof the economy, accounting for over 55 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of employment, this\nsector will need to receive substantial attention.\n42. To enable the poor to take advantage of the employment and income\nopportunities deriving from growth, targeted efforts will be made to enhance the productivity of\nthe poor and raise their incomes. Within these broad concerns, it is recognized that Nepalese\nwomen are among the poorest and most disadvantaged. The Bank, in keeping with the\nGovernment's poverty reduction strategies, will therefore continue to incorporate gender\nconsiderations in all relevant areas of its operations in Nepal.\nF.\t Policy Dialogue\n43. Policy dialogue duringprocessing of the proposed Project focused on the specific\nroles of WDD/MLD in the WID program, and the increased and more varied involvement of\nNGOs in W1D.\n44. Since its inception in 1982, PCRW has achieved significant progress in reducing\npoverty and improving the quality of life of the low-income and socially disadvantaged rural\nwomen in 35 districts. However, the project has been confined to only a few villages in each\nof the districts, mainly because of the low number and heavy workload of WDD field staff. To\nintensity the coverage of the WID program and to reach more beneficiaries, the Government and\nthe Mission agreed that the future roles of WDD will be confined to coordination, supervision\nand monitoring, while the implementation of Project activities will be gradually delegated to\ncompetent NGOs or subcontracted to other Government agencies or specialized training\ninstitutions or projects, although the prime responsibility for Project implementation will remain\nwith WDD.\n45. As part of the Government's policy to involve NGOs in national development, the\nGovernment and the Mission discussed the need to develop alternative mechanisms for delivery\nand recovery of microcredit involving NGOs. In this context, the Government has agreed to\nprovide a more favorable environment for the development of NGOs in the country through the\nBank's Operational Strategy in Nepal, January 1993.", "12\nreorientation of the role of SSNCC (now called SWC) and the adoption of policies and legislation\nfor the promotion of the participation of NGOs in financial services including savings\nmobilization. In addition, institutional support to NGOs has been included in the scope of the\nProject to strengthen the financial, managerial, technical and implementation capacities of NGOs\nso that they will be able to assist the Government in implementing WID programs and other\npoverty reduction programs.\n46. During the past 10 years, PCRW has been implemented by WDD mainly in the\nrural areas, since most of the poor live in those areas. However, considering the high literacy\nrate of women and the existence of pockets of poverty in the urban areas, and given the\nimportance of urban areas as centers of cottage industry and business development, the\nGovernment agreed to expand PCRW to selected urban areas under the proposed Project.\nIV. THE PROJECT\nA.\t Outline\n47. The proposed Project is designed to improve the socioeconomic status of women\nand promote their greater participation and integration in national development through\nconsolidating and expanding related service and development systems. The Project area\ncovers 12 districts and five towns that have a large number of women beneficiaries. Project\nassistance will focus on appropriate skills training and delivery of microcredit to women\nbeneficiaries through a new credit infrastructure involving both commercial banks and efficiently\nmanaged NGOs. The Project will complement ongoing efforts to reduce poverty in both rural\nand urban areas, will create employment opportunities for women in the small-scale enterprise\nsector, and is expected to provide new and replicable models for doing this. The target\nbeneficiaries of the Project will be mostly rural women who live below the poverty lines but will\nalso include a limited number of poor urban women and employees in the commercial sector.\nThe Project is in line with the Bank's sectoral objectives and strategies designed to reduce\npoverty through the creation of self-employment and wage-employment, the enhancement of\nthe role of women in development, and the strengthening and use of NGOs in Project\nimplementation.\nB.\t Rationale\n48. Among the poor, Nepalese women constitute the most disadvantaged sector in\nthe society, yet they provide over one half of the labor force in the agriculture sector. Past\nexperience indicates that promotion of women's income-earning abilities has had a major impact\non their participation in decision making regarding various household and agricultural matters.\nIn addition, since women are also the primary caretakers of households, their increased skills\nand knowledge will be transferred effectively to other family members. Therefore, a project with\nThe poverty line is defined by the National Planning Commission as the households who\nearn annual per capita income below NRs 2,500 in 1992 prices.\nThe Bank's Operational Manual No. 22 and 24, December 1986; and the Bank's Medium-\nTerm Strategic Framework (1993-1996), February 1993.", "13\nits focus on women in the development process is especially important in relation to poverty\nreduction and is essential for achieving overall viability of most development programs.\n49. To promote their income-earning abilities, it is essential that women be provided\nwith resources in the form of credit and services in the form of awareness and skills training.\nDuring the last ten years, a number of externally financed projects have been implemented by\nthe Government to address specific needs and constraints facing women, and to strengthen the\npublic sector institutions responsible for meeting their service and development needs.\nAlthough notable progress has been achieved by such projects in the introduction of essential\ncommunity development and income-generating activities for rural women, a significant number\nof women have remained outside the benefit stream. The major constraints affecting the WID\nprogram are the physical and financial limitations of the Government institutions in-charge of\nWID programs and the existing ineffective modalities for delivery of credit to the poor involving\nthe commercial banks. It is therefore necessary and appropriate to try new ways of reaching\nthe women.\n50. During the past few years, there has been a slow but significant build-up of NGO\nactivities in Nepal at the village and district levels. Many NGOs have shown willingness to orient\ntheir objectives and programs to serve women provided they are given financial and institutional\nsupport. Experience elsewhere in Asia and to a limited extent in Nepal itself has indicated that\nlocal NGOs can gradually develop the potenilal to complement Government efforts to promote\ncommunity development programs and to expand savings and credit services to the public.\nThe Government has indicated its willingness to encourage private sector community\ndevelopment and credit support services by involving NGOs, and to develop a favorable climate\nfor NGO development.\n51. In view of the above considerations, the Project has been designed to serve\ninitially as a pilot program to develop alternative mechanisms for delivery and recovery of\nmicrocredit involving NGOs, and to ensure that proven strategies are subsequently introduced\non a regional and national scale. The districts and towns included in the Project area have been\nselected to ensure that there are a large number of poor women and that the NGOs, commercial\nbanks and WDD staff are available to provide credit and other services under the Project.\nInstitutional support will be provided to NGOs so that they will be able to deliver credit and other\nservices to women beneficiaries. In designing the Project, the Mission carried out extensive\nconsultations with the Government, aid agencies, a number of potential participating NGOs and\nintended beneficiarIes)-'\nC.\t Objectives\n52. The overall goal of the Project will be to assist the Government in the\nimprovement and enhancement of the socioeconomic status of women and promote their\ngreater participation and integration in national development, thereby contributing towards\nDuring and after the loan fact-finding and loan appraisal stages, extensive consultation\nmeetings with the Government, aid agencies and NGOs combined with field trips and\ndiscussions with potential beneficiaries were undertaken to enable the Mission to design\na project that will be workable under the conditions prevailing in the Project area.", "14\npoverty reduction in Nepal. In order to contribute to the sectoral goal, the objective of the\nProject will be to improve the income and employment of poor women in selected rural and\nurban areas.\n53. The Project covers 12 districts and five towns' in Nepal (see Map). The\ndistricts and towns have been selected on the basis of the following criteria: (i) a large number\nof women beneficiaries; (ii) the deployment of one WDO and at least five WWs in each of the\nProject districts; (iii) the presence of NGOs and the participating banks, which can be linked with\nthe delivery of credit and other services under the Project; (iv) existing or planned activities of\nother aid agencies, particularly USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP/lnternational Labor Organization\n(lLO) [Training for Rural Gainful Activities (TRUGA)], and GTZ [Small Business Promotion Project\n(SBPP)] which will complement and enhance Project benefits (see paras. 62-65); and (v) relative\naccessibility of the areas, which will facilitate Project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\nThe selection of the districts and towns has also taken into account the ongoing activities of\nSFDP Ill to maximize complementarity while avoiding duplication.\nD.\t Scope\n54.\t To achieve the objective, the scope of the Project will include the following\ncomponents:\n(I) group formation and training of women beneficiaries including\nrehabilitation and improvement of existing training facilities to support\nboth staff and beneficiary training activities under the Project;\n(ii) institutional support to selected NGOs to enable them to expand the\ndelivery of community development and savings mobilization services to\nProject beneficiaries; and\n(iii) provision of credit to women beneficiaries who have been provided with\nskills training under the Project or from other programs for viable income-\ngenerating activities.\nProiect Components\n(a)\t Group Formation and Training of Women Beneficiaries\n55. The Project will provide support to WDD/MLD for carrying out social preparation\nand training of women beneficiaries. Women beneficiaries in the Project area will be mobilized\nand organized into stable self-help groups that will be used as focal points for access to public\nand private sector services. This will be followed by training to prepare them to undertake viable\nincome-generating activities. Women beneficiaries who have been organized into self-help\ngroups will be given appropriate skills training in crop production, livestock production, cottage\nDang, Pyuthan, Salyan, Kaski, Parbat, Baglung, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Chitwan, Dhankuta,\nSaptari and Siraha.\nKathmandu, PokharaJDumre, Nepalganj, Bhaktapur and Dhankuta.", "15\nindustry or small business. Consultants will be required to assist WDD in implementing,\nsupervising and coordinating the training activities; in carrying out inventories of training facilities\nand courses offered by the Government, internationai and national NGOs, and multilateral and\nbilateral agencies; and in preparing appropriate training manuals for specific courses.\n56. To support staff and beneficiary training efforts, the Project will provide funds to\nrehabilitate the existing MLD's Women Training Centers located in the Project area (e.g.,\nKathmandu, Pokhara, and Dhankuta) and construct additional classrooms and hostel services\nwhere appropriate, install improved water supply systems, and procure suitable training\nequipment and furniture. In addition, the Project will also improve and refurbish the Training\nMaterials Production Center (TMPC) in Kathmandu. The improvements to the TMPC will include\nthe rehabilitation of the existing physical facilities and procurement of appropriate printing\nequipment. The TMPC will be used to publish all training materials required by the Project.\n(b)\t Institutional Support to NGOs\n57. The Project will provide support to (i) carry out detailed surveys of NGOs in the\nProject area; (ii) prepare needs analyses of viable self-help groups (SHGs) and NGOs that are\ninterested in working for the Project; and (iii) strengthen the self-management and accounting,\nplanning and implementation capacities of selected NGOs. Subsequently, the selected NGOs\nwill be assisted in introducing credit-related services initially as agents of participating\ncommercial banks, and later as direct financial intermediaries.\n58. The selected NGOs will be provided with support for staff training, minimal\nincremental office furniture and equipment needs, and funds to cover part of their operating and\nmaintenance costs. NGOs, that have been sufficiently strengthened will subsequently be\nengaged to carry out in-field servicesncIuding group formation, training of beneficiaries, savings\nmobilization, and group activity planning and operation. These NGOs will receive further staff\ntraining and supervisory support in conjunction with participating commercial bank field staff to\nenable them to act as credit agents, and later as financial intermediaries.\n59. Exchange programs between key NGQ staff in Nepal and those in other\ndeveloping countries where grassroot development activities and financial service programs are\nsuccessfully operating will be organized under the Project to assist the NGOs in Nepal to adopt\nsuccessful concepts and develop appropriate expertise. The participants in the exchange\nprograms will also include officials from WDD, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the\nparticipating banks.\n(c)\t Provision of Credit to Women\n60.\t The Project will make available credit for on-farm and non-farm income-generating\nactivities. Such activities will include crop, livestock and vegetable production, where women\n- are demonstrably the primary decision makers and the principal beneficiaries of the income\ngenerated, and any eligible enterprise in the agroprocessing, manufacturing, trade, transport\nand service sectors in areas not presently serviced by existing credit schemes. Credit will be\nprovided for fixed investment and/or working capital purposes to women beneficiaries, as\nindividual or group loans secured by joint liability of the members of the group, since most\nwomen in Nepal have no control over the. assets of the family that can be used as collateral.", "16\n61. The Project will make available credit to women beneficiaries who have been\norganized into stable SHGs and have received appropriate skills training under this or similar\nprojects. Credit will be supplied for the following purposes:\n(i) Agricultural Production Credit. A medium-term loan of up to NRs 30,000\nwould be made to sub-borrowers who have completed the requisite\ntraining in foodgrain, livestock or vegetable production, with a repayment\nperiod of up to seven years on the security of group savings linked to\ngroup guarantees;\n(ii) Micro-enterprise Credit. Women beneficiaries who have been trained in\nvarious skills using TRUGA facilities and methodologies (see para. 65) will\nbecome eligible for subloans for income generation subprojects of their\nchoice, related to their skills and resources. Based on the credit\nrequirement of the micro-enterprises, the women will be able to apply for\na medium-term loan of up to NRs 40,000 with a repayment period of up\nto seven years on the security of group savings and/or group guarantees;\nand\n(iii) Small Business Credit in Urban Areas. Following the successful\ncompletion of their training under the SBPP (see para. 65), women\nbeneficiaries will become eligible to borrow for subprojects of their choice,\nrelated to their skills and resources. Subloans under this component\nwould be NRs 50,000-250,000 per sub-borrower, repayable over a period\nof up to seven years on the secunty of individual savings and group\nguarantees r other adequate collateral. Applications for enterprise\nsubloans will require full feasibility analysis.\n2.\t Complementary Projects and Programs\n62. The scope of the Project complements the related activities assisted by other aid\nagencies. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) has agreed to provide\na TA for Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME) to WDD. The scope of the TA will include (i)\na review of the various BME systems currently set up under WDD; (ii) integration of the systems\ninto a unified management information system, which will effectively monitor changes in\nwomen's well-being brought about by the Project and other projects implemented by WDD; (iii)\na benchmark survey in Project districts to collect socioeconomic information on beneficiaries;\nand (iv) processing of documentation, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment of the\nProject on a regular basis. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $200,000 which UNIFEM has\nagreed to finance on a grant basis. The TA will be processed by UNIFEM on a parallel\nbasis. In addition, UNIFEM has also indicated its agreement to finance a TA for Mainstreaming\nGender Considerations into National Development, which will examine the structural obstacles\nto women's full participation in national development and recommend to the Government\nappropriate corrective measures in policy, institutional responsibilities and the legal framework.\nThe total cost of the second TA is estimated at $100,000, which will be financed by UNIFEM on\na grant basis. This TA will also be processed by UNIFEM on a parallel basis. The two lAs will\nsupport the overall objectives of the Project..", "17\n63. The USAID-assisted Rapti Development Project is operating in five districts in the\nMid-Western Development Region during its second phase (1987-1995). Five major programs\nare being implemented: agriculture, natural resources restoration and protection, employment\nand skills development, infrastructure development and institutional development. Three of the\nfive districts (viz., Dang, Salyan, Pyuthan) have been included under the Project. Selection of\nthese districts has been carried out in close consultation with USAID-Nepal with a view to\nmaximizing benefits accrued as a result of complementarity between the training and credit\nactivities under the Project and the social, community and skills activities supported by USAID.\n64. Under the ongoing PCRW, UNICEF and UNFPA have been providing support to\nthe Government's adult education, family planning, maternal and child health, and community\ndevelopment programs in 24 districts. For 1992-1 997, UNICEF and UNFPA have approved the\nexpansion of their programs to another 20 districts including nine districts covered by the\nproposed Project. The Project area has been selected to ensure that the training and credit\nactivities under the Project will complement the social services and community development\nactivities to be supported by UNICEF and UNFPA.\n65. The ongoing TRUGA financed by UNDP is a vocational training method\ndeveloped by ILO to promote non-agricultural employment and income-generating activities for\nthe rural poor. The third phase of TRUGA (1993-1998) covers all the districts in Nepal. The\nongoing SBPP supported by GTZ has also provided training of entrepreneurs in seven urban\nareas since 1983. The facilities and methodologies developed by these two projects will be\nutilized in the training of women beneficiaries under the proposed Project. The Project will\nextend its credit assistance to trainees of these two projects.\nE.\t Cost Estimates\n66. The total Project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation and\nservice charge on the Bank loan during construction, is estimated at $9.6 million, consisting of\n$3.9 million in foreign exchange and $5.7 million equivalent in local currency. A summary of\nthe Project cost is presented in Table 1 (see Appendix 2). The cost estimates are based on\ncurrent 1993 prices.\nThe third phase of TRUGA has been renamed by the Government as Training for Rural\nEmployment Project (TREP).", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n18\nTable 1: Project Cost Summary\n($'OOO)\nComponent\t FX\t LC\t Total\n1.

The Government has requested a loan in Special Drawing Rights from the Bank's\nSpecial Funds resources in an amount equivalent to $5.0 million to finance the equivalent of\n$3.0 million in foreign exchange costs and the equivalent of $2.0 million in local currency costs.\nThe Bank loan would be made to the Kingdom of Nepal on the standard terms and conditions\napplicable to loans made by the Bank from its Special Funds resources. The loan will finance\n52 per cent of the total Project cost, mainly to cover the costs of credit and the rehabilitation of\nWTCs and TMPC. However, in the event that the Government is able to obtain grant funding\nfor the rehabilitation of WTCs and TMPC, the loan amount allocated to this component\n(approximately $1.0 million) would be reallocated or cancelled.\n68. An amount equivalent to $900,000 will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis\nfrom the Japan Special Fund to meet the costs of group formation and training. The\nGovernment of Norway has approved a grant in an amount equivalent to $2 million to finance\nthe cost of the NGO institutional support component of the Project. The rest of the Project cost\n(amounting to $1.7 million equivalent) will be met by the Government ($0.8 million), the\nparticipating banks and NGOs ($0.45 million) and the beneficiaries ($0.45 million). The\nGovernment's contribution of $0.8 million will include in-kind contributions of approximately $0.5\nmillion, mainly in the form of provision of Project staff and training facilities. The financing plan\nfor the Project is summarized in Table 2 (see Appendix 2 for details).", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n19\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($'OOO)\nSource\t FX\t LC\t Total\t Percentage\nBank Loan 3,050 1,950\t 5,000\t 52\nBank Grant (JSF) 180 720\t 900\t 9\nNorway Grant 630 1,370\t 2,000\t 21\nGovernment 0 830\t 830\t 8\nParticipating Banks! 0 450\t 450\t 5\nNGOs\nBeneficiaries 450\t 450\t 5\nTotal 3,860 i70\t9,630\t 100\n\t\nG. Implementation Arrangements\n1.\t Project Management and Organization\n69. There are two Executing Agencies for the Project. These are WDD under MLD,\nwhich will be the Executing Agency for the components covering group formation and training\nof women beneficiaries and institutional support to NGOs, and NRB (the Central Bank of Nepal)\nwhich will be the Executing Agency for the credit component. WDD will be responsible for day-\nto-day management and implementation of the Project including responsibility for reporting and\nBME (see details in Appendix 3). Following the PCRW model, which has been developed by\nWDD, women beneficiaries will be identified through household surveys conducted in selected\nvillages in the Project area which will be carried out by the field staff of WOD comprising WDOs\nand WWs. The women will then be mobilized and organized by WDD staff into stable SHGs,\nwhich will be used as focal points for access to public and private sector services. The groups\nwill undergo a series of training courses to promote awareness and achievable development\naims, leadership development, group dynamics and potential socioeconomic development,\nwhich will prepare the women beneficiaries to undertake viable income generating activities.\nThis social preparation, based on the PCRW model, will be given by WDD field staff or other\ntrainors who have been trained under PCRW and under the Project. eneficiary needs\nassessment will be made by WDD field staff through a participatory process so that feedback\nfrom beneficiaries will be fully reflected in the design of a package of assistance, which may\ncomprise social services (e.g., adult literary classes, family planning and maternal and child\nhealth care) and skills and management training for income generation. Following the social\npreparation work, women beneficiaries will be given appropriate skills training based on a\nthorough assessment of their needs, availability of raw materials and other inputs, and markets\nfor the products or services. Training courses for beneficiaries will be undertaken either in the\ntraining centers or in rented buildings at the village level in the Project area.\n70. Skills training to be provided to women beneficiaries under the Project will be\nsubcontracted by WDD to specialized training institutions or projects such as district training\ncenters operated by the Department of Agricultural Development, TRUGA project and SBPP.", "20\n71. While WDD is implementing the group formation and training of beneficiaries,\nthere will be a parallel activity to strengthen the management, accounting, planning and\nimplementation capacities of selected NGOs. The Project will also support the development\nof grassroot organizations including SHGs to become viable NGOs. The strengthening of local\nNGOs will be carried by the NGO Support Unit!' in three stages. Following the identification\nof NGOs and SHGs through detailed surveys of NGOs in the Project area, NGOs will be\nselected on the basis of agreed upon criteria (see Appendix 3) and given training to assist\nWDD in social preparation and the provision of planning support and development services to\nwomen beneficiaries (Stage I). Subsequently (Stage II), it is anticipated that a number of the\nbetter working NGOs will be selected to act as agents for participating banks' financial services\nin channelling financial services. These NGOs will be provided training in subproject appraisal,\nfinancial analysis and loan performance monitoring. Eventually, during Stage lii, some of the\nStage Il NGOs will be selected on the basis of strict eligibility criteria to provide direct credit\nto sub-borrowers. The selected NGOs that have received appropriate training will actively\nparticipate in Project implementation as catalysts and intermediaries, with the ultimate\nobjectives of reducing the workload of WDD field staff in Project implementation and expanding\nthe coverage of the Project to other villages within a given district.\n72. After the beneficiaries have received skills training under the Project or similar\nprojects, WDD field staff will help them to obtain microcredit from the participating banks (PBs)\nwhich include RBB and NBL. However, the role of WDD in the preparation of credit\napplications, and credit supervision and coordination will be gradually taken over by NGOs,\nas there are well trained Stage II NGOs capable of acting as credit agents for the PBs. In this\nway, NGOs will gain experience in financial services, which will help them to qualify as future\ndirect financial intermediaries. Thus, under the Project there will be two mechanisms for credit\ndelivery and recovery. In the first mechanism (called Model A), NAB will relend a part of Bank\nloan proceeds to the PBs, which will onlend directly to sub-borrowers (women beneficiaries).\nIn the second mechanism (called Model B), NRB will relend a portion of the loan proceeds to\nNGOs for onlending to sub-borrowers where NGOs are willing and are experienced in fulfilling\nthe financial services function. However, since most NGOs in Nepal are at present in the\nnascent stage, during the first three years of implementation, the Project will focus on\nstrengthening NGOs, and with respect to credit, will use the PBs as financial intermediaries in\naccord with the existing PCRW model (Model A). At the end of the third year, a comprehensive\nmid-term review will be carried out of the progress of the Project, the development of the\nBorrower's policy on promotion and regulation of NGOs' activities, and thecapacity of NGOs\nto act as financial intermediaries - based on which the Government and the Bank will decide\nwhether to utilize NGOs as financial intermediaries under Model B, in addition to Model A. This\nstaged approach will minimize the risks of involving NGOs in the delivery and recovery of\nmicrocredit to women beneficiaries, since Model B will be used under the Project only if the\nresults of the mid-term review are satisfactory.\nThe NGO Support Unit comprising domestic and international consultants will be\nestablished within WDD as an autonomous team under the guidance of the Project\nDirector.", "21\n73. The Project activities at the village level will be jointly carried out by WWs and\nlocal NGOs, while the activities in the urban areas (towns) will be implemented mainly by\nNGOs using support services oftered by the Executive Officers of municipalities under MLD and\nSBPP. The activities will be coordinated at two levels. At the central level, the Government will\nestablish a Project Implementation Committee (PlC) to ensure centralized leadership and close\ncoordination among Project entities. The establishment of the PlC will be a condition for loan\neffectiveness. The PlC will be chaired by the Joint Secretary of MLD in charge of WDD, who\nwill serve as Project Director, and will comprise the WDD Undersecretary, the Chief Manager\nof the Development Finance Department of NRB, the Team Leader of the NGO Support Unit\nand representatives of the PBs. At the district level, WDO will coordinate the Project activities\nwith the District Development Committee, other Government agencies and the NGOs. Within\na district, WDOs will coordinate Project activities in both villages and urban areas. The\nGovernment will appoint the Undersecretary of WDD as Project Manager, who will be\nresponsibile for day-to-day implementation and management of the Project. He will be\nassisted by several program officers, who will work for the Project on a full-time basis. The\nexisting WDD Central Advisory Board chaired by the Secretary of MLD will provide policy\nguidance for the Project.\n2.\t Financing Arrangements\n74. The proceeds of the Bank loan attributable to the noncredit component will be\nchannelled to WDD through regular budgetary transfers, while the proceeds of the Bank loan\nattributable to the credit component of the Project will be relent by NRB to PBs, and\nparticipating NGOs. The Bank's loan will finance up to 80 per cent of the total cost of each\nsubproject. The PBs or NGOs will provide 10 per cent and the beneficiaries another 10 per\ncent either in cash, kind or in labOr. However, the contribution of NGOs toward the cost of\nsubprojects will be reduced to a minimum of 5 per cent if the local NGOs have inadequate\nfinancial resources to provide the required 10 per cent of the total cost of subprojects. It is\nanticipated that, during the first three years of Project implementation, Bank loan proceeds will\nbe relent to PBs, which will include RBB and NBL under Model A. Other banks!f as approved\nby the Government and the Bank may be invited to participate if this proves advantageous with\nrespect to increased disbursement rate, geographical accessibility or beneficiary preference.\nNGOs and WDD staff will assist in mobilizing beneficiaries to borrow from the PBs by assisting\nthem in preparing subloan applications and by carrying out credit supervision activities. In the\nlatter part of Project implementation, these proceeds will also be lent to duly selected and\naccredited NGOs under Model B in the event that Model B is adopted by the Government and\nthe Bank after completion of the Mid-Term Review of the Project.\n75. The Government and NRB will enter into a suitable administrative arrangement\nto regulate the terms upon which NRB, as the agent of the Government, will relend the\nproceeds of the Bank Loan attributable to the credit component. NRB will enter into financing\nagreements with the PBs and with selected and accredited NGOs. Subsidiary loans will be\nmade on the basis of an acceptable pipeline of subprojects, and will bear an annual interest\nThese banks may include the Eastern Rural Development Bank and Far Western Rural\nDevelopment Bank which will be established by the Government in July 1993.", "22\nrate of 6 per cent. Repayment periods will vary depending on the nature of the subprojects\nto be financed, but will not exceed 15 years, inclusive of a grace period of not more than 3\nyears. As the repayment periods of the subsidiary loans from PBs/NGOs to NRB will exceed\nin most cases those of the subloans, PBs/NGOs are expected to recycle the repayments made\nby beneficiaries either in support of other sub-borrowers or for repeat loans.\n76. The financing agreements will specify that the PBs and NGOs will onlend the\nproceeds of the loans, together with their own funds, to beneficiaries at a minimum of 17 per\ncent per annum, which is the prevailing commercial bank lending rate in Nepal, to allow an\ninterest spread of at least 11 per cent. This spread is required to cover the high costs of\nintermediation and supervision of microcredit, premium for any guarantee fee that might be\npayable by financial intermediaries, provision for bad debts and a small profit margin. In\naddition, under Model A, part of the interest margin wilt be passed on to the NGOs for their\nservices as credit agents to the PBs. The interest spread under the Project is comparable to\nthe spread of 13 per cent provided under the ongoing IFAD-financed PCRW. The PBs and\nNGOs will bear the credit risk of the subloans. The subloans will be made on specific terms\nand conditions and will be processed in accordance with the agreed upon procedures (see\nAppendix 3). The subloans will be made to women beneficiaries as individuals or as groups.\nIn appropriate cases, individual members of the group will be jointly and severally liable for\nrepayment obligations of each individual. Further security will not be required except in cases\nwhere it is appropriate to create security over assets financed bya subloan. Further details\non financing arrangements are given in Appendix 3.\n3.\t Environmental Aspects\n77. Given the nature of the Project, which supports small-scale economic activities\nby poor women, the Project is not expected to have significant adverse environmental impacts,\nand therefore it has been classified as a category C project. Nevertheless, the Project will take\nmeasures to avoid negative environmental impacts through training of beneficiaries and NGOs.\nThe skills-training activities for women's groups and institutional support to NGO component\nwill include courses on sound environmental practices such as selection of crop mixtures that\ncan both generate cash income and improve soil fertility, and proper feeding and management\nof livestock to reduce overgrazing and deforestation. The environmental training extended to\nNGOs wiH assist them in making better choices among subprojects to be financed under the\nProject. If warranted, the Borrower will conduct, prior to the provision of a subloan, an initial\nenvironmental examination and environmental impact assessment according to environmental\nrules and regulations in the country.\n4.\t Project Implementation Schedule\n78.\t The Project will be implemented over a period of six years in a phased manner\n(see Appendix 4). During the first phase of about three years, Project activities will focus on\n\u2022 -- preparatory work such as establishment of the NGO Support Unit; survey of NGOs in all the\nProject districts and towns; selection and accreditation of NGOs; training of WDD staff, NGO\nstaff and women beneficiaries; and detailed design and improvement works for the WTCs and\nTMPC. At the same time, the mechanism for delivery of credit through PBs under Model A will\nbe used and refined in Dang, Pyuthan and Salyan districts and in the major towns of\nKathmandu, Pokhara/Dumre and Nepalganj. These activities will be closely monitored and", "23\nreviewed by WDD/MLD and the Bank every year. A comprehensive Mid-Term Review will be\ncarried out by the Government, the Bank and other agencies (particularly Norway and UNIFEM)\nat the end of the first three years of Project implementation. The terms of reference for the Mid-\nTerm Review are given in Appendix 5. Based on the findings of this review, adjustments in\nProject design and implementation will be considered, and, a decision whether to utilize the\ncredit delivery and recovery under Model B, in addition to Model A, and to expand the Project\narea to other districts and towns will be made by the Government and the Bank. During the\nsecond phase (years 4-6), proven concepts and activities will be expanded to the other nine\ndistricts and two towns in the Project area, but there will be flexibility in the final selection of\ndistricts and towns based on the results of the Mid-Term Review.\n5.\t Procurement\n79. In view of the multiplicity of small sub-borrowers and the diverse nature of\ngoods and services to be procured under the credit component, international competitive\nbidding, international shopping or local competitive bidding are not expected to be economic\nor efficient. Accordingly, most procurement will be done according to normal commercial\nprocedures through direct purchase by the sub-borrowers, in accordance with paragraph 3.08.\nof the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement - Purchase of Equipment for Use of Small Private\nSub-borrowers\".\n80. The civil works related to the rehabilitation and improvement of the WTCs will\nbe carried out on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank\nsince the works are relatively simple and dispersed widely over the Project area, and it is\nunlikely that international contractors will be interested to bid. Equipment and vehicles required\nby the Project will be procured mainly on the basis of international shopping and, in some\ncases, through direct purchase procedures. The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement will be\nused in the procurement of civil works and equipment.\n6.\t Consulting Services\n81. The services of local and international consultants required under the Project\nwill be financed from the proposed grants from JSF and the Government of Norway. Under\nthe JSF-financed group formation and training of beneficiaries component, a total of about 132\nperson-months of consultant services from individual sources will be required in the following\nfields of specialization: institutional development (local), planning/training (local) and Project\nimplementation (local). The terms of reference for consultant services are described in\nAppendix 5. Under the Norway-assisted Institutional Support to NGO component, a total of\nabout 156 person-months of consultant services from suitably qualified firms comprising about\n18 person-months of international consultants and about 138 person-months of local\nconsultants will be required. The team of consultants will include the following experts: (i)\nNGO Development Specialist (foreign), (ii) NGO Management Specialist (local), (iii) Training\nSpecialist (local), (iv) 'Financial/Marketing Specialist (local), (v) Microcredit Specialist (foreign),\nand (vi) NGO Credit Specialist (local). The terms of reference for consultant services are\npresented in Appendix 5. The consultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.", "24\n7.\t Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n82. Overall monitoring of the physical and financial progress of the Project in\nrelation to work plans and budgets for the group formation and training of beneficiaries\ncomponent will be the responsibility of WDD. Baseline information on beneficiaries will be\nobtained by WDD with the assistance of NGOs. A benchmark survey, monitoring and\nevaluation studies of the Project's impact on beneficiaries will be carried out by WDD with\nassistance from UNIFEM following the procedures already established under PCRW. The main\nindicators to be monitored by WDD are the number and size of SHGs formed, number of\nwomen beneficiaries trained and provided with credit, amount of loans disbursed and repaid,\nand impact of the Project on family income and employment. To supervise and provide\ntechnical support to its field staff, WDD will appoint five experienced field officers as program\nofticers based in Kathmandu. In addition, process documenters will be engaged by WDD to\nmonitor field level procedures closely to understand the detailed interaction between\ndevelopment agents and the women beneficiaries, and to identify issues and constraints that\nrequire management action immediately. WDD will be responsible for the verification and\nanalysis of the information collected by other institutions. NRB, as the Executing Agency for\nthe credit component, will supply the information needed for monitoring the credit component\nto PlC. The results of the Project BME will be included in the semiannual progress reports that\nwill be furnished by the Project Director to the Bank and other aid agencies (see para. 87)\n8.\t Disbursements, Accounts, Reports and Audit\n83. The Borrower will cause NAB and WDD to establish, within three months after\nthe effective date of the Loan-Agreement, imprest accounts to facilitate the timely disbursement\nof loan proceeds to finance, respectively, the credit and noncredit components of the Project.\nAdvances will be made annually on the basis of the anticipated demand for credit by\nparticipating banks and NGOs and for the noncredit component by WDD. The imprest\naccounts will be established, managed and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions\nsatisfactory to the Bank and consistent with the Bank's Guidelines on Imprest Account.\n84. NRB will transfer the advance for the credit component to an account to be\nopened especially for the Project. The loans to the NGOs will be disbursed by NRB directly\nor through other banks. Repayments by NGOs will be deposited to NRB's Microcredit Project\nfor Women account directly or through other banks.\n85. To liquidate the advances provided by the Bank to NAB, the Project Director,\nin cooperation with NRB, will submit to the Bank every six months certification of liquidations\nof the advance supported by two Statements of Expenditures (SOE: (i) the first SOE will\nsummarize disbursements by NAB to the PBs and NGOs; and (ii) the second SOE will\nsummarize payments by PBs and NGOs to the sub-borrowers.\n86. WDD and NAB will continue to maintain separate accounts and financial\nstatements for the Project and to have these audited annually by the Auditor General of Nepal.\nThe audited accounts will be provided to the Bank within 12 months of the end of the fiscal\nyear to which they relate. The PBs and NGOs that are involved in the delivery of credit under\nthe Project will be required to submit their audited financial statements to NRB not later than\n12 months after the end of each related fiscal year, and their financial statements will be", "25\naudited annually by suitably qualified external auditors. In addition, to enable the Bank to\nmonitor their institutional and financial performance, the two PBs will be required to submit their\naudited financial statements not later than 12 months after the end of each related fiscal year.\n87. Besides SOEs, the Project Director will also furnish the Bank and other aid\nagencies (including UNIFEM and the Government of Norway) semiannual progress reports on\noverall Project implementation. Within three months of the closing of the loan, the Project\nDirector will submit a Project completion report that will review in particular the impact of the\nProject on beneficiaries and the utilization of loan proceeds.\nH.\t Executing Agencies\n88. WDD/MLD will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the group\nformation and training of women beneficiaries and NGO institutional support components of\nthe Project, while NRB will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the credit\ncomponent, with the assistance of the PBs and concerned NGOs. The selected NGOs will also\nassist WDD in implementing the group formation and training of women beneficiaries.\n89. WDD has had considerable experience as an executing agency for a number\nof WID projects covering some 49 districts in five development regions. It has developed the\nPCRW model, which will be used, expanded and improved under the Project. During the\nimplementation of the WID projects, the following major constraints or problems were\nidentified: (i) limited implementation capacity of WDD; (ii) excessive responsibility of the WDO\nand other field staff; (iii) delay in the release of Government budget to WDD; and (iv) rigidity\nof the participating banks in channelling agricultural credit. During recent years, the\nGovernment has taken concrete measures to overcome the constraints. These measures are\ndescribed below.\n90. The Government has increased the number of staff of WDD to replace the\ncontractual staff with permanent staff or to fill up the approved vacant positions. Recently, for\nexample, 19 WDOs, 37 supervisory WDOs, 98 chief WWs, 74 WWs, and 22 accountants were\nrecruited by WDD to build up the implementation capacity of field staff. The existing WDD\nCentral Advisory Board (chaired by the Secretary of MLD) has been revitalized so that it can\nprovide effective policy guidance and coordination to the WID projects, and WDOs have been\nshifted from the field to district headquarters to enable them to coordinate program activities\nat the district level effectively, and to participate in the District Development Committee\nmeetings. In addition, seminars and workshops attended by staff from WDD, line agencies and\nPBs are organized annually by WDD as a means to improve planning, coordination and\ncommunications. This ensures that the line agencies will be involved right from the planning\nstage of the program; that clear implementation guidelines, strategies and standard norms are\ndeveloped by WDD; and that the banking procedures for extending microcredit to women\nbeneficiaries are clearly specified. To improve Project implementation, the Government has\nreleased WDD's budget in a timely manner, and WDOs have been given financial authority in\nthe management of project funds at the district level. Finally, the data base at the central,\ndistrict and village levels has been improved as a means to monitor and evaluate the program\nimplementation.", "26\n91. The Government realizes that the number of WDD staff cannot be continuously\nincreased to cope with the increasing demands of the WID program because of physical and\nfinancial constraints facing the Government. Therefore, under the Project, the implementation\ncapacity of WDD will be further improved through the following measures: (i) selected NGOs\nwill be used to complement the activities of WDD staff in the delivery of support services and\ncredit to Project beneficiaries; (ii) part of the TA grant from JSF will be earmarked to train WDD\nstaff at the central and district levels about their tasks and responsibilities under the Project so\nthat there is clear understanding about their roles and about the Project itself; (iii) field staff of\nWDD will be provided with motorcycles or bicycles to improve their mobility; and (iv) NRB and\nWDD will establish imprest accounts to facilitate the timely disbursement of loan proceeds to\nfinance, respectively, the credit and noncredit components of the .Project.\n92. As a central bank, NAB has had wide experience in monitoring and supervising\ncredit projects in Nepal. As an Executing Agency for the credit component, it has considerable\nexperience in the implementation of the priority sector credit scheme, the World Bank-assisted\nCottage and Small Industry Project and IFAD-assisted PCRW. In view of this experience and\nits technical competence in supervising and monitoring credit projects in Nepal, NRB is\nconsidered n appropriate agency for implementing the credit component of the Project.\n93. The PBs include RBB and NBL. These banks have been selected because they\nhave extensive networks of branches throughout Nepal and have had considerable experience\nin lending microcredit to the poor under PCRW and priority sector lending programs. Although\nthe banks have had weak performance in the past, their performance is expected to improve\nsignificantly in the coming years as a result of the corrective measures they are taking with the\nhelp of the Government and the World Bank (see para. 35 and Appendix 3). In addition, the\nfinancing agreements between NAB and the PBs will provide appropriate safeguards to ensure\nthat Project funds relent to them are monitored and effectively utilized.\nI.\t Technical Assistance\n94. TA for the Group Formation and Training of Women Beneficiaries will\naccompany the proposed loan. The main objective of the TA is to provide social preparation\nand skills training to women to equip them for undertaking income-generating activities and\nsmall enterprises and/or for gaining remunerative employment where possible. The Executing\nAgency for the TA will be WDD/MLD. The TA will be financed from the Japan Special Fund on\na grant basis in the amount of $0.9 million. Although it is unusual for JSF-financed TA to be\nused for TA components of the projects financed by Bank loans, the cooperation arrangements\nbetween Japan and the Bank recognize that this maybe appropriate in special cases. The\nProject design provides that skills training and beneficiary participation (to be provided under\nthe TA) should be integrated with the provision of credit under the proposed Loan. The TA will\ntherefore form part of the Project itself.", "27\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.\t Financial and Economic Analysis\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries\n95. Although precise quantification of Project benefits and the number of\nbeneficiaries is not possible because of the multiple credit line nature of disbursement under\nthe Project, estimates based on a tentative allocation of Project resources indicate that about\n20,000 women will be benefited from the skills training component. After receiving training in\nvarious technical, financial and/or management skills, it is expected that about 10,500 of them\nwill get agricultural production credit; about 3,000, micro-enterprise credit; and about 300, small\nbusiness promotion credit. The other trained women beneficiaries are expected to rely on their\nown savings or to obtain credit from other sources.\n96. At full development, the Project will have a direct impact on (i) the production\nof foodgrains, vegetables and livestock products; and (ii) the development of cottage and agro-\nindustries. It will foster the entrepreneurial spirit among women and increase their self-reliance.\nThe new jobs created from the enterprises supported through credit under the Project are\nestimated at 13,800 person-years for self-employment, and 11,000 person-years for wage\nemployment, comprising 10,500 person-years in the agriculture sector, 12,300 person-years\nin the cottage industry sector, and 2,000 person-years in the small business sector (see\nAppendix 6). The job creation cost will range from $116 per job in the cottage industry sector\nto $250 per job created in the small business sector. In economic terms, the credit component\nof the Project will generate total net income of about $4.45 million for its entire economic life,\nof which agricultural production credit alone will generate a net income of about $2.11 million.\n97. Improvement of the financial, manageriai, technical and operational capacities\nof NGOs supported by the Project will contribute to their long-term viability and sustainability.\nThe Project will improve the ability of local NGOs to assist the Government in implementing\nWID programs in rural and urban areas. These NGOs will also form a nucleus for the\ndevelopment of a self-sustaining financial system that will benefit the target group through\nprovision of savings, credit and related financial services.\n98. The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for typical subprojects range from\n24 per cent to 61 per cent while their economic internal rates of return range from 13 per cent\nto 35 per cent (see Appendix 6). Net cash flows after debt service indicate that the subprojects\nare attractive from the borrowers' point of view. Among the subprojects, livestock production,\ncottage industries and small business activities show high FIRRs. However, some of the\nsubprojects in the cottage industries seem to be sensitive to sales declines, suggesting that\nmarketing arrangements for their products should be examined closely by the banks or NOOs\nbefore recommending the subprojects to women beneficiaries. Under the Project, the NGO\nSupport Unit will advise the NGOs and the banks on the selection of viable\nenterprises/activities, in addition, the type of skills training to be offered by the Project to\nbeneficiaries will take into account the availability of markets for finished products and\navailability of raw materials and other inputs.", "28\n2.\t Proiect Risks\n99. The principal risk for the Project is that NGOs in Nepal lack sufficient experience\nto deliver social and financial serces to the Project beneficiaries as anticipated. To minimize\nthis risk, the involvement of local NGOs and SHGs in the delivery and recovery of microcredit\nwill be developed gradually and systematically. For this purpose, there will be a detailed\nsurvey of NGOs and self-help groups in the Project area, followed by identification of NGOs\nthat meet strict eligibility criteria to act as credit agents under Model A or as financial\nintermediaries under Model B, and TA and training support to eligible NGOs during the first\nthree years of Project implementation. Wherever possible, the Project activities will be carried\nout in districts and villages where NGOs and SHGs are known to operate. After the\nstrengthening phase and a thorough Mid-Term Review of the Project, the Government and the\nBank will decide whether to use the NGOs as financial intermediaries. In the event that the\nGovernment and the Bank decide to proceed with the credit delivery and recovery system\nunder Model B, the more developed NGOs in Kathmandu would be used initially as financial\nintermediaries, while district or village-based NGOs would be brought in later. This phased\napproach will ensure that a sufficient number of competent NGOs and SHGs can be developed\nto deliver the social and financial services under the Project, and that the risks of their\ninvolvement as financial intermediaries will be minimized. However, in some villages where\nsuitable NGOs cannot be found, the WDOs and WWs under MLD, in combination with the\nparticipating banks, will continue to organize beneficiaries and deliver social and financial\nservices to women using the PCRW model. The two credit delivery mechanisms under the\nProject (i.e., Models A and B) will enable the Project beneficiaries to receive credit from either\nthe PBs or the NGOs.\n100. The second identified risk for the Project is that the participating banks will not\nbe able to deliver and recover microcredit efficiently due to their weak performance in the past\nleading to unsatisfactory loan disbursements and repayment rates. The Project will meet this\nrisk by (i) designating WWs or eligible NGOs to act as agents for the participating banks,\nassisting in loan applications, project supervision and repayment follow-up in addition to group\nformation and beneficiary training, (ii) providing a sufficient interest spread of at least 11 per\ncent to cover the high costs of intermediation and supervision of microcredit, provision for bad\ndebts and a small profit margin, (iii) involving NGOs as financial intermediaries to complement\nthe activities of the PBs if after three years of Project implementation, the NGOs are found to\nbe willing and experienced in fulfilling the financial services function, (iv) utilizing other banks\nin the delivery and recovery of microcredit to Project beneficiaries if this proves advantageous\nwith respect to increased disbursement and repayment rates, and (v) insuring the loans to\nbeneficiaries with the Credit Guarantee Corporation. The risks related to the participating\nbanks will be further reduced by (I) the efforts of the Government and the World Bank to\nimprove the performance of the participating banks, (ii) the small size of the credit component\n(about $3.5 million) in relation to their assets (about $540 million) and deposits (about $430\nmillion), and (iii) the excellent repayment records of women subborrowers in the past\n101. The third identified risk for the Project is that bureaucratic rigidity will inhibit\ninnovation, leading to delays and inefficiencies in Project implementation. As the Project is of\na pilot nature, trying to develop a new modality for delivery of financial services to the poor,\nit is necessary that sufficient flexibility be provided during implementation, by both the\nGovernment and the Bank, to overcome unforseen obstacles. As much flexibility as possible", "29\nhas been provided in the Project design. For example, NGOs are free to formulate their\nrelationship with the beneficiaries in a way that suits their individual circumstances. Financing\narrangements can be altered to facilitate the flow of funds without sacrificing control and\nsupervision standards. For this purpose, an annual review and a Mid-Term Review have been\nincluded in the Project to consider adjustments in Project design and implementation\narrangements.\n102. The fourth identified risk for the Project is the limited implementation capacity\nof WDD. The Project will meet this risk through the following measures: (i) Project activities\nwill initially be concentrated in three districts that have already had a full complement of well-\ntrained WDD staff, and then the activities will be gradually expanded to other districts if WDD\nis able to engage trained field workers; (ii) local NGOs will be engaged by the PlC to\ncomplement WDD staff in undertaking the Project activities; and (iii) part of the grant funds will\nbe utilized to engage consultants and supporting staff to assist WDD in Proj?ct implementation.\n103. To minimize the risks discussed above, the Project will be closely supervised\nby the Bank during its implementation. During the initial years, loan review missions will be\nundertaken more frequently than usual in order to monitor closely the progress of Project\nimplementation, to identify problems that the Project will encounter and to work out measures\nto solve the problems.\nB.\t Social Dimensions\n104. The Project has been designed to improve the socioeconomic status of low-\nincome, socially disadvantaged women in selected districts and towns in Nepal. Beneficiary\nparticipation has been incorporated in the design of the Project to ensure that its assistance\npackage is based on the needs oT beneficiaries, in addition to constraints and opportunities\nprevailing in the Project area (see para. 69)\n105. The approach of the Project is considered innovative, since it is intended to\nencourage Government agencies and NGOs to work together at the village and urban levels\nto develop, promote and implement community service and development programs\ncorresponding to established needs of the women beneficiaries, and to develop alternative\nmechanisms for delivery and recovery of microcredit involving NGOs. The success of this\nProject will have far-reaching consequences on the implementation of the WID program in the\ncountry, as it will greatly improve the coverage of the Government's poverty reduction program.\n106. Social preparation is considered a prerequisite to any human resource\ndevelopment and investment program targeting marginal beneficiaries, especially women. For\nthis reason, the Project will emphasize social preparation as part of the strategy to improve the\nsocioeconomic status of women (see para. 69). In addition, to ensure the effectiveness of the\nincome-generating programs to be carried out under the Project, credit will be made available\nto women beneficiaries only after they have been organized into stable SHGs and have\nreceived appropriate skills training.\n107. In addition to improving the socioeconomic status of women, institutional\ndevelopment of NGOs will be carried out as a separate but parallel activity under the Project.\nImprovement of the financial, managerial, technical and operational capabilities of NGOs", "30\nsupported by the Project will not only improve the delivery of services and resources to target\nbeneficiaries, but will also contribute to their long-term viability and sustainability. In the long\nrun, the Project will improve the ability of local NGOs to assist the Government in implementing\nWID programs and other poverty reduction programs in rural and urban areas.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.\t Specific Assurances\n108.\t The Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i) Improvement of Training Facilities. The Borrower will, in consultation\nwith the Bank, develop and implement procedures for the operation of\nWTCs, including (a) the introduction of revised curricula for appropriate\nskills training for rural women and in-service training of trainers, WDOs\nand WWs; (b) the introduction of follow-up field courses for trainees\nincluding, where appropriate, the provision of liaison arrangements with\nfinancial intermediaries; and (c) measures to enable the WTCs to\nfunction as multi-user facilities available at cost to public authorities and\nNGOs, thereby increasing utilization.\n(ii) Staffing. The Borrower, through MLD and in consultation with the Bank,\nwill maintain or create sufficient permanent position (a) for a WDO in the\nDistrict Headquarters within the organization of Local Development\nOffices of MLD in the Project area, and (b) for WWs in each village in\nwhich the P\u00f3ject activities are carried out.\n(iii) Regulation of NGOs. The Borrower will keep the Bank informed at all\ntimes of proposals to introduce legislation or regulations to govern the\nactivities of NGOs. In particular, the Borrower will, within one year of\nthe effectiveness, adopt a policy, including proposals for legislation, to\npromote the participation of NGOs in the development process. This\npolicy will include measures to (a) simplify the registration procedures\nfor NGOs, including the adoption of a recognized definition of NGOs for\nthe purpose of registration with the competent authorities; (b) develop\na regulatory framework and specific mechanisms to enable NGOs to act\nas financial intermediaries; (c) identify the functions of SWC as a\nfacilitator of the activities of NGOs, with responsibility for monitoring and\naudit of NGOs; and (d) introduce mechanisms for collaboration between\nlocal NGOs and international NGOs. In addition, as a condition for\ndisbursement of funds to NGOs for credit operations, the Borrower will\nhave adopted appropriate legislation or regulations to provide specific\nmechanisms for the delivery of credit by NGOs.\n(iv) Approval by NRB of Financing Agreements. The Borrower will ensure\nthat NRB, in consultation as necessary with other agencies, adopts\nsimplified procedures, including the identification of any information to", "31\nbe required as part of an application, to enable decisions to be reached\nwithin a reasonable period of time on applications by NGOs for\npermission to lend and borrow money. The Borrower will ensure that\naccreditation of NGOs constitutes approval by NAB for such NGOs to\nlend and borrow money.\n(v) Mid-Term Review. The Borrower, the Bank and the Government of\nNorway will conduct a comprehensive mid-term review of all aspects of\nProject implementation within three years of the effectiveness. This\nreview will include an assessment of the progress of the Project, the\ndevelopment of the Borrower's policy on promotion and regulation of\nactivities of NGOs, and the capacity of NGOs to act as financial\nintermediaries. Based on the outcome of the review, the Borrower and\nthe Bank, in consultation with the Government of Norway and other aid\nagencies, will decide whether to utilize Model B, in addition to Model A,\nfor the remainder of the Project. The review will recommend in\nparticular any necessary changes to organizational and institutional\nstructures to improve Project implementation and any appropriate\nexpansion of Project activities within the Project area beyond the initial\nphase.\n(vi) Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. MLD will, within one year of\nthe effectiveness, appoint five experienced field officers as program\nofficers, based in Kathmandu, to supervise and provide technical\nsupport to WDOs by means of regular and more frequent visits to the\nProject area. WDD will be responsible, in accordance with\narrangements satisfactory to the Bank, for monitoring Project\nimplementation and evaluating Project benefits. In particular, WDD, in\nconsultation with UNIFEM, will carry out initial baseline surveys ol\nbeneficiaries and will engage NGOs and appropriate local individuals\nand institutions to assess the impact of the Project on beneficiaries.\nWDD will be responsible for verification and analysis of the information\ncollected by NGOs, individuals and institutions.\nB.\t Conditions of Loan Effectiveness\n109. The Borrower will have established a PlC within WDD, headed by the Joint\nSecretary in charge of WDD as Project Director; and entered into arrangements satisfactory to\nthe Bank for the provision of the Norwegian grant or alternative funds to finance Part B of the\nProject.", "32\nVII.

The Women Development Division WDD) under the Ministry of Local\nDevelopment (MLD) will be the main Executing Agency for the group formation and training of\nwomen beneficiaries and non-government institution (NGO) institutional support components\nof the Project, while Nepal Rastra Bank (Central Bank of Nepal or NRB) will be the main\nExecuting Agency for the credit component, with the assistance of the participating banks (PBs)\nand concerned NGOs. The selected NGOs will also assist WDD in implementing the group\nformation and training of women beneficiaries.\nB.\t Implementation Arrangements\n1.\t Women Development Division\n2. WDD/MLD will take overall responsibility for reporting and benefit monitoring and\nevaluation (BME). The WDD Undersecretary in charge of special program assistance will be the\nCoordinator for the two components. The Project will be implemented through the existing\nadministrative structure of MLD at the national and district levels. At the national leve', WDD will\nbe supported with a Project Implementation Committee (PFC) with a secretariat staffed by WDD.\nThe PlC, chaired by the Project Director, will act as a focal point for overall Project management\nand coordination (see para. 41). At the district level, Women Development Officers (WDOs) will\ncoordinate the activities of the Project with NGOs and Government agencies through the District\nDevelopment Committees. At the village level, Women Workers (WWs) of WDD will be\nresponsible for identification, mobilization and training of women beneficiaries in cooperation\nwith selected NGOs. To facilitate the coordination of Project activities at the district level, WDD\nwill cause WDOs to maintain accounts for counterpart funds provided by the Borrower.\n3. The principal tasks and responsibilities of WDD will involve (i) posting of WDOs\nand WWs in the Project area and provision of appropriate curriculum development and in-\nservice training of its staff to meet Project implementation needs; (ii) preparation of inventory on\nongoing training programs carried out in districts and municipalities, the availability of fixed and\nmobile training facilities, and the number and location of beneficiaries who have obtained\nappropriate skills or business development traihing and are potential recipients for follow-up\ncredit and support assistance; (iii) curriculum development and beneficiary training in social\npreparation, self-help group (SHG) formation, savings mobilization, and appropriate practical\nskills and simple business operations; (iv) coordination with the NGO Support Unit for providing\ninstitutional support to NGOs; (v) liaison with line ministries, bilateral and multilateral agencies,\ninternational NGOs, PBs and District Development Committees on the integration of the Project\ninto local area development programs; and (vi) preparation of semiannual progress reports and\nthe completion of BME studies to meet the needs of the Government, the Bank and the United\nNations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Some of these activities will be assisted by\nconsultants.\n(References in text: page 19, para. 69; page 20, para. 71;\npage 22, para. 76; page 26, para. 93)", "40\nAppendix 3\nPage 2\n4. Within WDD an NGO Support Unit, comprising domestic and international\nconsultants, will be established within one year of the effectiveness as an autonomous team\nunder the guidance of the Project Director. Its principal function will be to supply a broad\nspectrum of institutional development and management services to NGO working within the\nProject area. Its principal tasks and responsibilities will be to (I) coordinate and liaise with Social\nWelfare Council (SWC), INGOs and any other agencies handling assistance programs to NGOs\nin the Project area; (ii) undertake and/or contract out surveys within the Project area to identify\nall successful SHGs with potential to develop as NGOs, all functioning registered and non-\nregistered local NGOs, and all branches of other NGOs operating in the Project area, and\nevaluate their suitabilities for institutional strengthening; (iii) provide institutional support to\nSHGs/NGOs selected; (iv) work with local NGOs to encourage the formation of NGO\nCooperation Associations (NGOCAs) at the district level to facilitate the development of groups\nof independent NGOs that can work together as teams to provide a broad spectrum of local\nservices; (v) assist local NGOs in the preparation of proposals for submission to the PBs or the\nApproval Committee (see para. 7); (vi) select, train and supervise local NGOs to work as agents\nof the PBs in the provision of credit to their members or groups of beneficiaries; (vii) in\nconjunction with NRB, design a new standard credit administration/accounting system for NGOs\ntogether with the necessary security and legal regulations, operational manuals and training\nmodules for NGO staff to enable NGOs to act as financial intermediaries; (viii) select and\npropose NGOs successfully operating participating bank agency schemes under (vi) above to\nNRB to provide direct financial intermediary services; (ix) receive and appraise applications for\nloans by NGOs that can be recommended to the Approval Committee; (x) recommend viable\nactivities! enterprises to NGOs and beneficiaries; and (xi) prepare and operate the necessary\ndata base/management information system, and routinely monitor and report on the institutional\nsupport to NGOs component of the Project to the WDD Undersecretary for inclusion in Project\nsix-monthly and annual reports.\n2.\t Nepal Rastra Bank\n5. NRB will be the Executing Agency for the credit component of the Project. NRB\nwill appoint the Chief Manager of the Development Finance Department as its Coordinator. The\nprimary task of NAB will be the provision of lines of credit to participating banks and NGOs for\nonlending to women beneficiaries.\n6. In consultation with the PlC, NRB will (i) work with WDD, the NGO Support Unit,\nand PBs to introduce appropriate systems and procedures for savings mobilization and credit-\nlinked operations in the Project area, using WDD staff and selected NGOs as client introduction\nand supervision agents under Model A (see para. 22); (ii) prepare and adopt an appropriate\nregulatory framework and mechanisms for NGOs to act as financial intermediaries; (iii) work with\nthe NGO Support Unit to introduce, field test and develop a new mechanism for credit delivery\nand recovery involving NGOs under Model B (see para. 22); (iv) establish Approval Committees\nin Kathmandu and Project districts/towns, which will process and approve loan applications from\nNGOs; (v) channel credit funds to participating banks and NGOs and make arrangements to\nreceive repayments; and (vi) monitor the progress of implementation of the credit component\nand prepare reports to the PlC in line with standardized formats required by the Government\nand the Bank.", "Appendix 3\nPage 3\n7. In the event that Model B is adopted after the completion of the Mid-Term Review,\nNRB will establish a National Approval Committee in Kathmandu comprising a representative\nof NRB as chairman, the Director of the PlC and a representative of the Ministry of Finance; and\na District Approval Committee comprising a representative of NRB as chairman, a representative\nof MLD and a representative of the NGO Cooperation Association or other district-level NGO\nassociation (henceforth called the NGO Cooperation Association) within 3 and 6 months,\nrespectively, of the completion of the Mid-Term Review. The NRB representative may be a\nNRB official or a nominee from a commercial bank, depending on the presence of NRB branch\noffices in the Project districts and towns. The Approval COmmittees will decide on the\napplications submitted by NGOs for inclusion in the credit component of the Project. Decisions\nwill be based on the recommendations of the NGO Support Unit. Approved NGOs will be\nrequired to sign a financing agreement with NAB acceptable to the Bank. The Approval\nCommittees will meet as frequently as required, at least once a month after the NGOs start to\napply for loans, to consider the applications submitted by NGOs.\n3.\t Participating Banks\n8. The PBs include the Government-owned Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal\nBank Umited (NBL). These banks have been selected because they have intensive networks\nof branches throughout Nepal and have had considerable experience in providing microcredit\nto the poor under the Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) Program and priority sector\nlending programs. Throughout the Project implementation period the PBs will be credit\nintermediaries under the MOdel A arrangements within the credit component of the Project,\nworking with WDD and NGOs to promote savings mobilization and channeling subloans\nfollowing their current practices to eligible beneficiaries who have received appropriate skills\ntraining either within the Project or from other programs.\n9. RBB and NBL are the oldest banks in Nepal and account for about 72 per cent\nof the resources of the banking system, while ADBN and the three joint venture banks account\nfor the remaining 28 per cent. Between them the two banks have 430 branches, staff strength\nof 11,200, assets amounting to NRs 27 billion and deposits amounting to NRs 21 billion. Almost\n70 per cent of the bank branches are in the rural areas. Rural branches are estimated to\nprovide about 60 per cent of the deposits and generate about 40 per cent of the lending\nbusiness. In view of their extensive branch networks and significance in the overall rural\neconomy, both IFAD and the World Bank have channeled funds through the two banks.\n10. Because of the importance of the two banks to the national economy, the\nGovernment commissioned the Commercial Bank Problem Analysis and Strategy Study\n(CBPASS) and the World Bank to examine the problems confronting the two banks. Data\npublished by NRB indicated that the two banks have incurred heavy losses during the last few\nyears. NBL incurred losses of NRs 801 million in 1991 /92 and NRs 901 million in 1992/93, while\nRBB incurred losses of NRs 662 million in 1991 /92 and NRs 877 million in 1992/93. The major\nfactors contributing to the losses include the following:\nThe composition of the District Approval Committee will be reviewed after the\nGovernment has established District and Village Development Committees in the Project\ndistricts to determine whether a representative of these should be included.", "42\nArpendix 3\nPage 4\n(i) Many of the rural branches are unprofitable because of high overhead\ncosts.\n(ii) Managers and staff require further training and improved motivation.\n(iii) The banks' credit management policies, branch operations, monitoring,\ninformation and accounting systems are not well suited to operating with\na commercial orientation.\n(iv) About one third of outstanding loans and advances are considered bad\ndebt and uncollectible as a result of the combined effects of losses in\nlending to large industrial/commercial firms owned by influential persons,\nand shortcomings in credit analysis and management.\n(v) The banks have inadequate spread as a result of poor quality portfolio\nand high reserve requirements.\n11.\t To improve the performance of RBB and NBL, CBPASS and the World Bank have\nmade the following recommendations:\n(I) The rural branch networks should be rationalized by reducing the\ntransaction costs and closing excess and underutilized rural branches to\nestablish viable branches.\n(ii) Fundamental institutional reforms should be put in place to turn the banks\ninto commercially oriented and profit-maximizing institutions.\n(iii) Credit discipline should be strengthened through establishing an effective\nlegal and administrative system for expeditious resolution of defaults.\n(iv) The two banks should be recapitalized to obtain capital adequacy in line\nwith international standards.\n(v) Financial, intermediation should be improved by lowering reserve\nrequirements and increasing interest rates on reserve assets.\n12. The Government and the banks have recognized the need for corrective actions\nand the Government is heavily committed to improving the performance of RBB and NBL.\nSome actions have already been taken while others are being implemented. Measures which\nhave been taken include increasing paid-up capital, closing loss-incurring branches, reducing\nexcess staff, improving credit analysis, management and supervision, and stopping behest loans\nand other loans based on Government guarantee.\n4.\t Participating NGOs\n13. For the purpose of the Project, NGOs will be defined as private, voluntary,\npolitically neutral, nonprofit organizations committed to helping the disadvantaged, the poor or\nthe needy, legally established and registered with the appropriate authorities. Based on this\ndefinition, NGOs include all private, voluntary organizations or societies organized and owned", "43\nAppendix 3\nPage 5\nindependently of Government agencies, SHGs, user groups, and private research and\ndevelopment organizations registered with the Chief District Office or any other appropriate\nagency of the Borrower.\n14. NGOs will actively participate in the Project as catalysts and intermediaries. Their\nprimary role will be in social preparation and the provision of planning support and development\nservices to their members (Stage I). Subsequently, it is anticipated that many of them will act\nas agents for PB financialservices (Stage II), with some eventually providing direct credit to sub-\nborrowers (Stage Ill). The NGOs will be selected by the NGO Support Unit in consultation with\nWDD and NRB according to the criteria agreed upon between the Government and the Bank\n(see para. 30).\n15. Stage I NGOs will be contracted to (i) assist in surveying the socioeconomic\nconditions in their catchment areas; (ii) undertake activities to create a heightened awareness\namong the target beneficiaries of the real potential of coordinated self-help and assisted\ndevelopment; (iii) institutionalize women's groups, which will become the focus for contact with\nand the provision of educational, health, technical extension, and savings and credit services;\nand (iv) strengthen women's groups to encourage the spirit of purpose and discipline to take\non credible viable income-generating activities both for the group and individual beneficiaries.\nTo strengthen the effectiveness of such NGO operations, participating Stage I NGOs will be\nencouraged to join NGOCAs at the district and municipality levels. The NGOCAs will bring\ntogether both national/regional NGOs operating in the concerned area and local-based NGOs.\nThe objectives of the establishment of such associations are (I) to foster inter-NGO support; and\n(ii) to promote the sharing of managerial and planning skills and to generate the widest possible\ncoverage of NGO services at the, local level. Membership in such associations will not be\ncompulsory.\n16. Stage I NGOs that demonstrate management competence, an understanding of\nthe concepts involved in developing income-generating activities and an ability to operate\nsavings mobilization programs effectively within their membership will be encouraged to become\nCredit Agents for the PBs (Stage II NGOs). No time restriction is proposed for initial successful\nStage I operations, as many NGOs have already demonstrated such potential. Selection of\nsuch NGOs will be undertaken jointly by the NGO Support Unit and the appropriate PB. Stage\nII NGOs will receive training for their staff in simple administration and credit accounting,\nsubloan project appraisal, noncollateralized security systems based principally on group liability,\nand loan supervision and recovery. Such training will be undertaken together with local PB\nofficials to promote understanding of their varying field roles.\n17. Subject to the acceptance of their members and a minimum of one year of\nsatisfactory operation as PB Credit Agents, Stage II NGOs will qualify for consideration by NRB\nas future direct financial intermediaries. The responsibility for selection as Stage Ill NGOs will\nlie with the NGO Support Unit in consultation with NRB and WDD using the criteria agreed to\nbetween the Government and the Bank. Stage Ill NGOs will be required to use the\nadministrative and accounting systems recommended by the NGO Support Unit and NRB to\nassist in the future development of a single national NGO Direct Financial Intermediary System.", "44\nAppendix 3\nPage 6\n18. Each NGO will proceed through the development process at its own pace. Some\nwell-established NGOs that have had satisfactory prior experience with delivery of financial\nservices to beneficiaries may proceed from Stage I to Stage Ill directly, while others may have\nto go through the three stages in a systematic manner.\nC.\t Financing Arrangements\nLending, Relending and Onlending Arrangements\n19. The proceeds of the Bank loan attributable to the credit component of the Project\nwill be relent to PBs and participating NGOs. The Bank's loan will finance up to 80 per cent of\nthe total cost of each subproject. The PBs or NGOs will provide 10 per cent and the\nbeneficiaries another 10 per cent either in cash, kind or labor. However, the contribution of\nNGOs toward the cost of subprojects will be reduced to a minimum of 5 per cent if the local\nNOOs have inadequate financial resources to provide the required 10 per cent. It is anticipated\nthat during the first three years of Project implementation, Bank loan proceeds will be relent to\nPBs, which will include RBB and NBL under Model A. Other banks as approved by the\nGovernment arid the Bank may be invited to participate if this proves advantageous with respect\nto increased disbursement rate, geographical accessibility or beneficiary preference. NGOs and\nWDD staff will assist in mobilizing beneficiaries to borrow from the PBs by assisting beneficiaries\nto prepare subloan applications and carrying out credit supervision activities. In the latter part\nof Project implementation, these proceeds will also be lent to duly selected and accredited\nNGOs under Model B.\n20. The Government and NRB will enter into a suitable administrative arrangement\nto regulate the terms upon which NRB, as the agent of the Government, will relend the proceeds\nof the Bank loan attributable to the credit component. NRB will enter into financing agreements\nwith the PBs and with selected and accredited NGOs. Subsidiary loans will be made on the\nbasis of an acceptable pipeline of subprojects, and will bear an annual interest rate of 6 per\ncent. Repayment periods will vary depending on the nature of the subprojects to be financed,\nbut will not exceed 15 years, inclusive of a grace period of not more than 3 years. As the\nrepayment periods of the subsidiary loans from PBs/NGOs to NRB will exceed in most cases\nthose of the subloans, the PBs/NGOs are expected to recycle the repayments made by\nbeneficiaries either in support of other sub-borrowers or for repeat loans.\n21. The financing agreements will specify that the PBs and NGOs will onlend the\nproceeds of the loans, together with their own funds, to beneficiaries at a minimum of 17 per\ncent per annum, which is the prevailing commercial bank lending rate in Nepal, to allow an\ninterest spread of at least 11 per cent. This spread is required to cover the high costs of\nintermediation and supervision of microcredit, provision of bad debts and a small profit margin.\nIn addition, under Model A part of the interest margin will be passed on to NGOs for their\nservices as credit agents to the PBs. Under the ongoing International Fund for Agricultural\nDevelopment (IFAD) financed PCRW project, the Government is allowing a 13 per cent margin\non average to PBs. The PBs and NGOs will bear the credit risk of the subloans. The subloans\nwill be made to women beneficiaries as individuals or as groups. In appropriate cases,\nindividual members of the group will be jointly and severally liable for the repayment obligations\nof each individual. Further security will not be required except in cases where it is appropriate\nto create security over assets financed by a subloan.", "45\nAppendix 3\nPage 7\n2.\t Mechanisms for Credit Deliveyr and Recovery\n22. Under the Project, there will be two mechanisms for credit delivery and recovery.\nIn the first mechanism (called Model A), NRB will relend a part of the Bank loan proceeds to the\nPBs, which will onlend directly to sub-borrowers (women beneficiaries). In the second\nmechanism (called Model B), NRB will relend a portion of the loan proceeds to NGOs for\nonlending to sub-borrowers (women beneficiaries) where the NGOs are willing and are\nexperienced in fulfilling the financial services function.\n23. The ultimate objective of the Project is to develop alternative channels for delivery\nof financial services involving NGOs (i.e., Model B). However, since the level of development\nof NGOs in Nepal is still at an early stage compared with NGOs in other Asian countries, it is\nnecessary in the initial years of the Project to strengthen the selected NGOs in the appropriate\nareas so that in later years, the Project beneficiaries will be able to obtain financial services\neither from the PBs (Model A) or from NGOs (Model B). To facilitate the delivery of financial\nservices involving NGOs, the Government has proposed to introduce legislation or regulations\nto govern the activities of NGOs. The Bank will be kept informed of the proposals. In particular,\nthe Government will, within one year of the effectivehess, adopt a policy including proposals for\nlegislation, to promote the participation of NGOs in the development process. This policy will\ninclude measures to simplify the registration procedures for NGOs, to develop a regulatory\nframework and a specific mechanism to enable NGOs to act as financial intermediaries, to\nreorient the functions of SWC as a facilitator of the activities of NGOs, and to introduce\nmechanisms for collaboration between local NGOs and international NGOs.\n24. The Government and NRB confirmed to the Mission that, while the existing legal\nand regulatory framework is undeveloped, there is no impediment to NGOs participating in the\nProject provided that they are duly registered with the appropriate authorities. In particular,\nNGOs may act as financial intermediaries after receiving the consent of NRB (acting in its\ngeneral central banking role as regulator of credit activities). NRB confirmed that such consent\nhad been given to NGOs in the past and that they did not anticipate difficulties in granting\nconsent in the future for the purposes of the Project. However, it is clear that financial\nintermediation by NGOs would be promoted by the development of a more detailed framework\nto regulate in the financial activities, including the establishment of systems for streamlined\napproval and monitoring procedures. The Mission suggested that such measures could be\nadopted by means of amendments to the Association Registration Act and by regulations made\nunder the Nepal Rastra Bank Act. The Government has agreed that such measures will be\nadopted before credit is disbursed by NGOs under the Project (although this would of course\nnot affect disbursement of credit by the PBs).\n3.\t Credit Delivery and Recovery System Under Model A\n25. Under Model A, the WDOs and WWs of MLD, together with local NGOs, will work\nclosely with Project beneficiaries throughout the period of the Project. The involvement of local\nNGOs will supplement MLDs activities, as it faces personnel and other resource constraints.\nThe WDOs, WWs and NGOs will organize the beneficiaries into cohesive groups and provide\nthem with skills training in cooperation with other agencies/projects. After the beneficiaries have\nsuccessfully completed the training program, they will be assisted in obtaining credit from the", "46\nAppendix 3\nPage 8\nlocal offices of the selected PB. Financing agreements acceptable to the Bank will be signed\nbetween NRB and the PBs under the Project, and the credit program of the PBs will be funded\nusing the Bank loan proceeds in accordance with these agreements.\n26. The PBs will improve their current standards with respect to loan appraisal for\nloans under the Project as recommended by CBPASS and the World Bank. WDD staff or Stage\nII NGOs will assist the PBs as credit agents. The WDD staff or NGO will have established a\nclose relationship with the prospective beneficiary through the group formation and training\nprocess and will be well placed to assist both the beneficiary with the application process and\nthe PB with appraisal and follow-up. The exact nature of the relationship between the PB and\nthe NGO, including agency and supervision fees or other compensation, if any, will be\nnegotiated between them.\n4.\t Delivery and Recovery System under Model B\n(a)\t Phasing of Proiect Activities\n27. During the first three years of the Project, credit will be delivered to women\nbeneficiaries by the PBs under Model A. During the next three years of Project implementation,\ncredit may be delivered to women beneficiaries by both Model A and Model B, subject to\napproval of the Government and Bank after the Mid-Term Review of the Project.\n(b)\t Approval Procedures for NGO Loans\n28. The approval procedures for loans to NGOs will be as follows: (i) loans to NGOs\nup to the amount of NRs 500,000 can be approved by the District Approval Committee; (ii) loans\nto NGOs up to the amounts of NRs 5;000,000 can be approved by the National Approval\nCommittee; (iii) a decision on the approval of loan requests will be taken up by the Approval\nCommittee concerned within four weeks after submission of the loan request; and (iv) a NGO\nmay receive a repeat loan only after it has disbursed 75 per cent of its immediately preceding\nloan and has satisfactorily complied with its existing obligations.\n(c)\t Financing Agreement\n29. The financing agreement to be executed between NAB and the NGO upon\napproval of the application by the Approval Committee should indicate the relending terms and\nconditions; the repayment and grace periods; the purpose for which the loan is made; reporting,\naccounting and auditing requirements; the right of NRB to initiate legal action to enforce\ncompliance with the terms of the agreement; and such other provisions as may be agreed upon\nby the Government and the Bank.\n(d)\t Selection Criteria of NGOs\n30. In consultation with WDD and NRB, the NGO Support Unit will select the NGOs\nthat will act as financial intermediaries. The eligibility of NGOs to act as financial intermediaries\nunder the Project will be determined on the basis of two sets of selection criteria. The first will\ndetermine whether the NGOs qualify for the institutional support to be provided under the\nProject. The second will determine whether NGOs can be used to provide credit directly to\nbeneficiaries. The first set of criteria includes the following:", "47\nAppendix 3\nPage 9\n(I)\t be registered with the concerned Chief District Office or any other\nappropriate agency of the Borrower to establish the NGO as a legal entity;\n(ii) have had at least one year of experience in social mobilization or other\ncommunity development work and a minimum coverage of 100\nbeneficiaries;\n(iii) have at least two administrative staff and a permanent office to handle the\nlending program;\n(iv) show high commitment to improve the socioeconomic status of women;\nand\n(v) have established locally based or district-based operations.\n31. After the strengthening phase of at least one year, the performance of the NGOs\nwill be evaluated under the following additional criteria to determine whether they are qualified\nto act as financial intermediaries:\n(i) key officers and staff of the NGOs have satisfactorily completed training\nfor NGO strengthening under the Project, or have availed of similar\nassistance provided by other entities;\n(ii) be willing to submit to external financial and administrative spot checking\nby NRB and the NGO Support Unit;\n(iii) demonstrate capability to perform basic subloan. appraisal following the\nprovision of short-term training under the Project;\n(iv) have adequate power under its constitution to borrow and lend money;\n(v) have had some financial service experience through assisting PBs in\nProject subloan follow-up- and supervision and mobilizing beneficiary\nsavings; and\n(vi) have agreed in writing with the PlC regarding arrangements for training\nof sub-borrowers, including social preparation activities, and savings or\ncapital build-up (CBU) arrangements, including details of the means of\nraising capital, allowed application of funds and custody and control\nprocedures.\n(e)\t ProcessinQ of Subloans from NGOs to Beneficiaries\n32. NGOs will make subloans to women beneficiaries who fulfill the following criteria\nand such other criteria as the Government and the Bank may agree upon the beneficiaries\nshould (i) either belong to a low-income group falling under the Government-defined poverty\nline, or be able to enhance labor-intensive employment by creating jobs for women belonging\nto the low-income group; (ii) have completed skills training provided by the Project or by other", "48\nAppendix 3\nPage 10\nprojects; (iii) be residents of the area where the subproject is to be undertaken; (iv) have no\nrecord of default with any commercial bank or other formal financial institution in Nepal, and (v)\nbe members of SHGs that have initiated savings mobilization activities.\n33. A subproject proposal submitted by a beneficiary or a group of beneficiaries\nshould satisfy the following requirements: (i) the subloan request does not exceed NRs 30,000\nper sub-borrower for agricultural production credit, NRs 40,000 per sub-borrower for\nmicroenterprise credit or NRs 250,000 per sub-borrower for small business credit; (ii) the\nsubproject is technically and financially viable and there are sufficient available raw materials\nand markets for finished products that its viability is not endangered; (iii) the sub-borrower for\nsuch subproject will provide at least 10 per cent of the subproject cost in cash or kind including\nlabor; (iv) the subproject should yield a financial internal rate of return exceeding the cost of\ncapital; and (v) the subproject is labor-intensive and environmentally friendly.\n34. To ensure sustainability of the micro-enterprises, NGOs will be allowed to grant\nrepeat loans to the beneficiaries up to the ceilings specified.\n35. The onlending agreement to be executed by NGOs and sub-borrowers upon\napproval of the subloan will include provisions for onlending terms and conditions; the\nrepayment period; the purpose for which the subloan is made; appropriate accounting\nobligations; CBU obligations; the right of the NGOs to initiate legal action to enforce compliance\nwith the terms of the onlending agreement; and such other provisions as may be agreed upon\nby the Government, the NGOs and the Bank.\n5.\t Savings Mobilization and Credit Guarantee\n36. NGOs are expected under the Project to include a savings mobilization\ncomponent in their programs of assistance to beneficiary groups in addition to any savings\nprogram for self-insurance purposes, either through compulsory periodic savings, voluntary\nsavings up to a minimum percentage of the requested loan amount, surplus interest charges\nor other agreed means. Savings thus mobilized may be in the name of the individual borrowers\nor the beneficiary group, and should be deposited in the local banks. Accumulated savings or\nCBU!' may be used as sub-borrower contribution, loan collateral, beneficiary loan fund or other\nagreed upon purpose. Stage Ill NGOs will agree in writing with the NGO Support Unit regarding\nsavings or CBU arrangements, details of the means of raising capital, interest rates, allowed\napplication of funds, and custody and control procedures. This arrangement will ensure that\n(i) beneficiaries will be able to repay their loans to NGOs, and (ii) NGOs will be able to\ncontribute at least 5 per cent of the total cost of subprojects (see para. 19).\n37. Loans to beneficiaries may be insured with the Credit Guarantee Corporation, with\nthe PBs or NGOs financing the insurance premium cost from the indicated interest spread\nwithout further charge to the sub-borrowers. Currently the premium is 0.25 per cent of the\noutstanding loan balance per quarter. However, the premium for livestock loans is 10 per cent\nof the outstanding balance with 5 per cent subsidized by the Government. Alternatively or in\naddition, at the option of the beneficiaries, group savings may be mobilized to finance a fund\nA surcharge of a minimum of 2 per cent on top of the onlending rate charged by the\nparticipating NGOs to subborrowers seems to be justified in order to establish a CBU.", "49\nAppendix 3\nPage 11\nto self-insure the loans of the beneficiaries in the group. This fund would then be an asset of\nthe group and would be managed accordingly by the group. Similarly, livestock loans could\nbe insured through savings mobilized at the group level. In this case, coverage of livestock\nloans under the Credit Guarantee Corporation scheme may not be required.\nD.\t Beneficiary Participation\n38. The Project was formulated through an extensive consultation process with\nintended beneficiaries, a number of potential participating NGOs and aid  agencies.!' The\nBank's Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations was used in\nassessing the potential beneficiaries in the Project area. During Project implementation,\nbeneficiary participation will be ensured through the following measures: (i) beneficiary\nmobilization and awareness raising through group formation; (ii) bottom-up needs assessment\nand planning process, especially at the district level; (iii) use of NGOs as change agents and\ndelivery channels of services and resources; and (iv) capability building of NGOs and WDD staff\nto serve target beneficiaries better.\n39. Social preparation, i.e., mobilizing beneficiaries and raising awareness for\npotential socioeconomic development (value-formation) is an essential part of the Project\nactivities. Such interventions are considered prerequisites to any human resource development\nand investment programs targeting marginal beneficiaries, especially women. Beneficiary needs\nassessment will be conducted by WDD staff and NGOs through a participatory process.\nFeedback from beneficiaries will be fully reflected in the design of a package of social service\nassistance (such as literacy classes) followed by skills and management training for income\ngeneration.\n40. The involvement of NGOs in Project implementation will enhance beneficiary\nparticipation and the bottom-up planning process. Because of their grassroot orientation and\nfocused but flexible approach, NGOs generally possess a comparative advantage to deliver\nservices and resources effectively to intended beneficiaries. The Project has been designed to\npromote the role of NGOs to complement the community work currently undertaken by\nGovernment agencies; and selected NGOs will supplement the channeling of financial resources\nto meet the demands of women beneficiaries for their income-generating activities.\nE.\t Proiect Management and Coordination\nProject Implementation Committee\n41. The Government will establish a PlC to ensure centralized leadership and close\ncoordination among the Project entities. The establishment of the PlC will be a condition for\nloan effectiveness. tts tasks and responsibilities will include but not be limited to (i) coordination\nof the work plans of the Executing Agencies; (ii) liaison with Government line ministries and\nparticipating external aid agencies involved in complementary WID and NGO programs, both\ninside and outside the Project area; (iii) supervision of the appointment and subsequent\nConsultation meetings with some 40 NGOs and about 15 aid agencies, and extensive\nfield trips and discussions with potential beneficiaries were undertaken during the loan\nfact-finding and loan appraisal stages.", "50\nAppendix 3\nPage 12\nactivities of consultants engaged within the Project; (iv) review of the physical and financial\nprogress of the Project; (v) identification, discussion and resolution of operational constraints;\n(vi) provision of guidance to the Implementing Agencies on administrative and financial matters\nwhen required; and (vii) introduction of any policy changes required by the Government, the\nWDD Central Advisory Board (CAB) and the Bank.\n42. The PIG will be chaired by the Joint Secretary of the MLD in charge of WDD, who\nwill serve as overall Project Director. The WDD Undersecretary in charge of special programs,\nthe Chief Manager of the Development Finance Department of NAB, the Team Leader of the\nNGO Support Unit and representatives from the PBs will serve as members (see Figure 1 for\nthe Project organization chart). The PlC will have powers to co-opt additional members if\nrequired. It will meet at least once every quarter. The WDD Undersecretary will be designated\nas Project Manager, since he will be responsible for day-to-day management and\nimplementation of the Project.\n4.3. At the district and municipal levels, the existing WDOs will coordinate and\nsupervise Project activities in cooperation with the district staff of concerned line agencies, and\nwill liaise with the members of the newly formed District Development Committees. Project\nactivities at the village level will be jointly carried out by WWs and local NGOs. Activities at the\nmunicipal level (urban areas) will be implemented by NGOs using support services offered by\nTraining for Rural Gainful Activities (TRUGA) and Small Business Promotion (SBP) projects, and\ncoordinated by WDOs through the Executive Officer of the municipality under MLD.\n2.\t WDD Central Advisory Board\n44.

At the end of the first three years of Project implementation, the Government, the\nBank and other lending agencies [particularly Norway and the United Nation Development Fund\nfor Women (UNIFEM)] will carry out a Mid-Term Review of the Project. The Review will assess\nthe progress of Project implementation, the problems and constraints of the Project and the\nprospects for achieving its objectives as envisaged at appraisal. Based on the findings of the\nReview, three decisions will have to be made: (i) changes in Project design and implementation\nto enable the Project staff to improve Project implementation; (ii) expansion of Project activities\nto other districts and towns included in the Project area; and (iii) initiation of credit delivery and\nrecovery under Model B, i.e., using NGOs as financial intermediaries.\nB.\t Terms of Reference\n2.\t The broad terms of reference for the Mid-Term Review will include the following:\n(i) Review all the documents, reports and data related to the Project and its\naccompanying technical assistance (TA) (JSF-assisted TA for Group\nFormation and Training of Women Beneficiaries and UNIFEM-assisted TA\nfor Benefit, Monitoring and Evaluation System) as well as the\nGovernment's policies and regulations on NGOs.\n(ii) Carry out field visits in the districts and towns included in the first phase\nof the Project (Dang, Salyan and Phyuthan districts, and Kathmandu,\nPokhara/Dumre, and Nepalganj) to assess the progress of the Project and\nto identify the problems and constraints faced by the Project staff, NGOs\nand beneficiaries.\n(iii) Assess the performance of Women Development Division (WDD) and\nNGOs in implementing the group formation and training of women\nbeneficiaries financed by JSF. Identify issues and constraints, and\nrecommend how the procedures and intervention strategy can be made\neffective in identifying, organizing and training women beneficiaries.\n(iv) Assess the performance of the NGO Support Unit in improving the\nmanagerial, technical and financial capabilities of local NGOs for\ndelivering microcredit to women beneficiaries and in assisting WDD staff\nto implement the Project activities. Identify issues and constraints, and\nrecommend how the procedures and intervention strategy can be made\neffective.\n(Reference in text: page 23, para.78; page 23, para. 81)", "54\nAppendix 5\nPage 2\n(v) Examine the performance of WDD, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the\nNGO Support Unit in the development of alternative mechanisms for\ndelivery and recovery of microcredit involving NGOs. Identify issues and\nconstraints, and recommend how the procedures and the intervention\nstrategy can be made effective for the delivery of microcredit to the target\nbeneficiaries through Model A (using the participating banks) or Model B\n(using the NGOs).\n(vi) Based on the review of (i) to (v) above, recommend changes in the\nProject design and implementation with a view to improving the progress\nof the Project. Taking into account the implementation capacity of WDD,\nNRB and NGOs and the accomplishments of the Project, recommend\nwhether the Prolect area should be expanded to nine other districts and\ntwo other towns as envisaged at appraisal, and whether the Project\nshould initiate Model B or continue with Model A.\nPART II: GROUP FORMATION AND TRAINING OF BENEFICIARIES\nA.\t Introduction\n3. While the Project design draws together all agencies currently involved WID\nactivities at the district level, there is limited relevant experience within WDD in the parallel\ndevelopment of Government and NGO WID activities, and in ensuring that curriculum re-\norientation is undertaken for both field staff and women beneficiaries to enable WDD efficiently\nto operate intensive social preparation and income generation activities linked to innovative\nsavings mobilization and credit services within the Project area. It is essential, therefore, that\nspecialist expertise be brought in from the very start of the Project to support WDD in sethng\nup and implementing critical activities, and that institutional strengthening efforts are maintained\nthroughout the implementation period.\n4. Because of the importance of the curriculum development and training efforts to\nWDD and national operations, the specialist team will be based in WDD/Kathmandu but will\noperate up to 40 per cent of its time in the field.\n5. A total of 132 person-months of local consultant services will be required in the\nfollowing fields of specialization:\nDomestic Consultants\n(person-months)\n1. Institutional Development Specialist\t 72\n2. Planning and Training Specialist\t 30\n3. Project Implementation Advisor\n\t\nTotal 132", "55\nAppendix 5\nPage 3\nB.\t Objectives of the Consultant Services\n6. The overall objectives of the consultant inputs are to supplement the existing\nmanagement capabilities of the head office cadre to allow WDD to take on further externally\nfinanced responsibilities and to ensure that a more balanced community development strategy\nis undertaken, concentrating initially on social preparation and group formation, and leading to\nthe provision of community services and the introduction of savings mobilization. Only when\ngroups are operating successfully as viable contact units will efforts be made to promote\nincome-generating activities, and only then for properly appraised subprojects.\nC.\t Scope of Consultant Services\n7.\t The scope of the TA will cover:\n(i) coordinating and liaising with all national and regional agencies handling\nwomen in development (WID) related activities to ensure that the social\npreparation, group formation, community service development and\neventual income generation promotion systems introduced under the\nProject match national needs;\n(ii) determining the actual requirements for WDD community development\nservices, the felt needs of target beneficiaries under the Project, and the\nintroduction of planning and implementation systems geared to resolving\nsuch issues;\n(iii) coordinating the planning, detailed design and implementation of the\nrehabilitation and equipping of the Women Training Center (WTC)\nfacilities, and the administration of procurement and disbursement\nprocedures to ensure compliance with Bank requirements;\n(iv) reformulating, designing, testing and evaluating new training curricula for\nWDD, WTC and NGO staff and for beneficiaries; and introducing methods\nby which such curricula can be regularly updated;\n(v) organizing and coordinating trainers and enumerators required for the TA;\n(vi) maintaining and causing cooperating agencies to maintain records and\naccounts adequate to monitor and evaluate the components of the\nProject;\n(vii) establishing a data base on (a) rural employment opportunities for women\nand (b) records of individual women beneficiaries of Project training\nprograms;

The consultant services under the proposed Project will be required to strengthen\nthe managerial, planning, technical and financial capabilities of selected NGOs so that they can\nprovide better services to women beneficiaries and, in a number of special cases, begin to\nprovide credit services to their members. In line with Project phasing, the headquarters of the\nNGO Support Unit will be established in Kathmandu, but some of the consultants will be based\nin Tulsipur in Dang district during the first three years. However, throughout the life of the\nProject, specialists handling NGO credit will be based in Kathmandu, as the majority of their\nwork is expected to involve national NGOs.\n12. A total of about 156 person-months of consultant services comprising about 18\nperson-months of international consultants and about 138 person-months of local consultants\nwill be required in the following fields of specialization:\nInternational\t Domestic\n\t\nConsultants\t Consultants Total\n(person-months)\n\t\n1.

Particular\nattention will be given to creating gender awareness and needs analysis in all their planning and", "\t\n\t\n60\nAppendix 5\nPage 8\ndevelopment efforts. TA will be provided to local NGOs through the NGO Support Unit, which\nwill establish the new concept of providing institutional development support directly to\nemerging or small NGOs at the district level. At the same time it is intended that NGO\nCooperation Associations at the district level established with its support will develop into\nsustainable units in their own right to continue to supply local area NGO support services after\nProject completion.\n14. The consultants will also work with PBs and NRB to develop, introduce, field test\nand operate new credit initiatives involving specially selected NGOs. Two systems will be\nintroduced involving NGOs as agents for the provision and supervision of PB-sourced credit,\nand the use of NGOs as direct financial intermediaries between NRB and sub-borrowers.\nC.\tScope\t of Consultant Services\n15. The scope of the consultant services will cover:\n(I) coordinating and liaising with the SWC and all agencies handling NGO-\nrelated activities and projects in Nepal to ensure the adoption of the most\nappropriate support services systems at the district level;\n(ii) surveying selected districts to identify all viable SHGs and all registered\nand nonregistered NGOs operating in the Project area; and encouraging\nthem to form informal cooperation associations and methodologies\nwhereby they can best benefit from a shared use of services that will\nupgrade their individual NGO operations on a self-help basis;\n(iii) determinating the exact requirements for institutional strengthening for\nspecific NGOs joining the cooperation associations at the district level,\nwith particular attention being given to financial management;\n(iv) establishing and implementing savings mobilization schemes within the\nmembers of NGOs linked to the PBs under the Project;\n(v) working with NRB to develop NGO-supervised and managed credit\nprograms providing loans to individuals and groups of beneficiaries under\ngroup guarantee systems linked to the partial use of accrued savings as.\ncollateral and/or equity contributions for loans;\n(vi) monitoring NGO credit programs;\n(vii) designing, testing and evaluating new training programs for NGO staff\nand women beneficiaries to match the real training needs of the specific\ndistrict;\n(viii) assisting WDD in establishing a data base on rural employment\nopportunities for women in the Project area with particular reference to the\nfinancial viability of such opportunities and their economic and social\nbenefits; and", "61\nAppendix 5\nPage 9\n(ix)\t carrying out or causing to be carried out required Project reporting\nfunctions.\nD.\t Terms of Reference\n1.\t NGO Development Specialist\n16.

As provision of microcredit for women is the only component directly related to\nincome-raising activity, the financial and economic evaluation is focused on the financial and\neconomic viability of the subprojects financed by the credit. Using a subloan provided under\nthe Project, women beneficiaries can start income-generating activities such as goat raising,\nwool spinning and tea shops. However, it is not feasible to identify all possible activities to be\nfinanced and to determine the total benefits derived from a mix of such varied activities.\nTherefore, in this context, the analysis has adopted a practical approach -- to pick representative\nsubprojects, examine their cost and benefit flows, and test their sensitivity. However, the\nanalysis should be regarded as Indicative\" rather than comprehensive. A brief economic\nanalysis from the viewpoint of the subproject is also attempted on the basis of the financial\nanalysis.\t -\nSelection of Subprojects\n2. Eighteen representative subprojects were selected in the light of (i) past\nexperiences with similar projects for women such as the Production Credit for Women (PCRW)\nproject and Small Farmers Development Project (SFDP); (ii) current market conditions and future\nprospects; and (iii) high degree of representation over similar activities. These subprojects\ncomprise eight activities for agriculture, seven for cottage industry and three for small\nbusinesses (see Table 1).\n2.\t Financial Models\n3. To analyze the financial viability, investment models have been developed for\neach activity taking into account the average business size and mode operated by women\nbeneficiaries, typical investment and running costs, terms and conditions for subloans. The data\nhave been derived from various sources including the Department of Cottage and Village\nIndustries and the commercial banks. They are adjusted to 1992 prices with some\nmodifications. The models are designed to produce net cash flows before and after debt\nservices, Financial Internal Rate of Returns (FIRRs) and some additional indicators for sensitivity\nanalysis.\n(References in text: page 27, para. 96; page 27, para. 98)", "67\nAppendix 6\nPage 2\nB.\t Underlying Assumptions for Financial and Economic Analysis\nPrices\n4. All financial prices will remain unchanged at 1992 constant prices. For foreign\ncosts, an official exchange rate of NRs 42.7 to the dollar is used.!! Economic prices of paddy,\nwheat and fertilizers have been derived from the World Bank forecast for 1995. For other\ncommodities, a standard conversion factor of 0.9 is used, while the economic price of farm labor\nis valued at 75 (SWR) per cent of the financial value.\n2.\t Subloans\n5. The subloan financed covers 90 per cent of the fixed assets and working capital\nrequired to start the subproject.' The remaining 10 per cent is to be provided by the sub-\nborrowers themselves, either in cash or in kind. Sub-borrowers have to pay back the principal\nand an annual interest of 17 per cent over 1-7 years at equal amount each year. For buffalo\nraising and many cottage industries, a one-year grace period and longer repayment periods (5-\n10 years) are applied.\n3.\t Cost and Revenue\n6. The investment cycle of the subproject ranges from less than one year\n(vegetables) to 10 years (small business) depending on the nature of the activities. The\ninvestment can be made in both fixed and working capital. In many cases, gradual increases\nof sales, the relevant increases in raw material costs, and a less flexible change in salaries and\noverhead costs for the first few years are assumed.\nC.\t Subproiects\nAgricultural Subprojects\n7. Following the experience in PCRW, over 70 per cent of subprojects to be financed\nunder the Project would be for agricultural activities involving livestock production and small-\nscale vegetable and cash crop production. This is mainly due to the limited access of women\nto productive land and their relative ease of entry into the above subproject because of the low\ntechnology requirement.\nAt appraisal, the exchange rate for trading through commercial banks was around NRs\n47-48 per dollar, which was the weighted average of the official rate and the travellers\ncheck rate.\nThe loan ceiling from the Bank under the Project is assumed at 80 per cent of the initial\ninvestment required. Therefore, an additional 10 per cent must be financed by\ncommercial banks or NGOs.", "68\nAppendix 6\nPage 3\n8. Livestock production would typically be for (i) improved much buffalo for milk and\ncalf production, (ii) improved goat production, (iii) improved piggery of two sows, and (iv)\npoultry production with a flock size of 25 birds. Crop production would be for cereal and\nhorticulture crops grown on less than half a hectare of land.\n9. The initial investment would be highest for milch buffalo at NRs 17,600 and lowest\nfor cereals in the Hills at less than NRs 1,000, because the former requires the purchase of\ncostly buffalo, while the latter needs only a small amount of money to buy fertilizers and seeds.\nIt is expected that, after appropriate training, women are willing to take credit for these activities\nbecause the requirement for skills and initial costs are relatively low. Family labor would be\nsufficient for these activities. Livestock purchased may be regarded as a security for the loan.\n2.\t Processing, Manufacturing and Service Industry\n10. The indicative microenterprises expected to be financed under the proposed\nProject would be mainly in the food processing and fabric-based cottage industries. Other\nmicroenterprises identified by the Department of Cottage and Village Industries include the\nmanufacturing of consumer items and subprojects in the services sector.\n11. Currently, the fabric-based industries such as wool spinning, rug and carpet\nweaving, dyeing and sewing are thriving in Nepal because of the strong demand for export and\nfrom tourists. Food processing is equally profitable and can be operated by local women using\nlocally produced crops, fruit and machineries. In addition, a number of business opportunities\nin the service sector exist for women in large cities like Kathmandu. Tea shops and restaurants,\ngrocery stores, laundry services, souvenir shops, etc. could be started by women. It is estimated\nthat the investment costs are lowest in beaten rice and beekeeping at around NRs 7,600, and\nhighest in rug and carpet weaving at over NRs 70,000. Most of these microenterprises are labor\nintensive and suitable for women. Requiring about 2-8 personnel per business, they contribute\nto the creation of employment among poor women and improvement in their incomes.\nD.\t Financial Analysis\n12. Under the identified conditions, most subprojects will be financially attractive. The\nestimated average net annual revenue ranges from NRs 2,600 for beaten rice to NRs 34,000 for\ncarpet weaving (see Table 1). Even after debt service the revenues are all positive. The\naverage revenues after debt service in livestock and vegetable growing are particularly high at\naround NRs 2,000 and would have a significant impact on women's social and economic status,\nconsidering the current poverty line, defined at around NRs 2,500 per person.\n13. The FIRRs range from 23.6 per cent in ginger processing to 61.4 per cent in\npoultry raising. The benefit-cost ratios are also favorable at around 2.0 for all crop activities.\nMost of the subprojects will still be financially viable under unfavorable conditions of decreased\nsales, increased fixed asset costs, increased raw material costs, say by 10 per cent, although\nsome cottage industries that require high fixed investment costs or raw material costs such as\nginger processing, sewing and sock knitting are vulnerable to declines in sales.", "69\nAppendix 6\nPage 4\nE.\t Economic Analysis\n14. Table 3 shows the Economic Internal Rate of Returns (EIRRs) of individual\nsubprojects calculated on the basis of the financial models and a given set ofassumptions\nstated in the footnote. The EIRRs of subprojects range from 13.2 per cent to 34.5 per cent,\nsuggesting that the selected subprojects are economically justifiable. Low EIRRs in some\nsubprojects may be acceptable because this computation does not include other non-\nquantifiable benefits or secondary benefits such as training or secondary employment resulting\nfrom the subprojects.\nF.\t Employment Creation and Net Financial Income\n15. At full development, the Project will have a direct impact on (I) the production of\nfoodgrains, vegetables and livestock products; and (ii) the development of cottage and agro-\nindustries. It will foster the entrepreneurial spirit among women and increase their self-reliance.\nThe new jobs created from the enterprises supported through credit under the Project are\nestimated at 13,800 person-years for self-employment and 11,000 person-years for wage\nemployment, comprising 10,500 person-years in the agriculture sector, 12,300 person-years in\nthe cottage industry sector and 2,000 person-years in the small business sector. The job\ncreation cost will range from $116 per job in the cottage industry sector to $250 per job in the\nsmall business sector. In economic terms, the credit component of the Project will generate a\ntotal net income of about $4.45 million for its entire economic life, of which agricultural\nproduction credit alone will generate a net income of about $2.1 1 million.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTable 1.

As provision of microcredit for women is the only component directly related to\nincome-raising activity, the financial and economic evaluation is focused on the financial and\neconomic viability of the subprojects financed by the credit. Using a subloan provided under\nthe Project, women beneficiaries can start income-generating activities such as goat raising,\nwool spinning and tea shops. However, it is not feasible to identify all possible activities to be\nfinanced and to determine the total benefits derived from a mix of such varied activities.\nTherefore, in this context, the analysis has adopted a practical approach -- to pick representative\nsubprojects, examine their cost and benefit flows, and test their sensitivity. However, the\nanalysis should be regarded as Indicative\" rather than comprehensive. A brief economic\nanalysis from the viewpoint of the subproject is also attempted on the basis of the financial\nanalysis.\t -\nSelection of Subprojects\n2. Eighteen representative subprojects were selected in the light of (i) past\nexperiences with similar projects for women such as the Production Credit for Women (PCRW)\nproject and Small Farmers Development Project (SFDP); (ii) current market conditions and future\nprospects; and (iii) high degree of representation over similar activities. These subprojects\ncomprise eight activities for agriculture, seven for cottage industry and three for small\nbusinesses (see Table 1).\n2.\t Financial Models\n3. To analyze the financial viability, investment models have been developed for\neach activity taking into account the average business size and mode operated by women\nbeneficiaries, typical investment and running costs, terms and conditions for subloans. The data\nhave been derived from various sources including the Department of Cottage and Village\nIndustries and the commercial banks. They are adjusted to 1992 prices with some\nmodifications. The models are designed to produce net cash flows before and after debt\nservices, Financial Internal Rate of Returns (FIRRs) and some additional indicators for sensitivity\nanalysis.\n(References in text: page 27, para. 96; page 27, para. 98)", "67\nAppendix 6\nPage 2\nB.\t Underlying Assumptions for Financial and Economic Analysis\nPrices\n4. All financial prices will remain unchanged at 1992 constant prices. For foreign\ncosts, an official exchange rate of NRs 42.7 to the dollar is used.!! Economic prices of paddy,\nwheat and fertilizers have been derived from the World Bank forecast for 1995. For other\ncommodities, a standard conversion factor of 0.9 is used, while the economic price of farm labor\nis valued at 75 (SWR) per cent of the financial value.\n2.\t Subloans\n5. The subloan financed covers 90 per cent of the fixed assets and working capital\nrequired to start the subproject.' The remaining 10 per cent is to be provided by the sub-\nborrowers themselves, either in cash or in kind. Sub-borrowers have to pay back the principal\nand an annual interest of 17 per cent over 1-7 years at equal amount each year. For buffalo\nraising and many cottage industries, a one-year grace period and longer repayment periods (5-\n10 years) are applied.\n3.\t Cost and Revenue\n6. The investment cycle of the subproject ranges from less than one year\n(vegetables) to 10 years (small business) depending on the nature of the activities. The\ninvestment can be made in both fixed and working capital. In many cases, gradual increases\nof sales, the relevant increases in raw material costs, and a less flexible change in salaries and\noverhead costs for the first few years are assumed.\nC.\t Subproiects\nAgricultural Subprojects\n7. Following the experience in PCRW, over 70 per cent of subprojects to be financed\nunder the Project would be for agricultural activities involving livestock production and small-\nscale vegetable and cash crop production. This is mainly due to the limited access of women\nto productive land and their relative ease of entry into the above subproject because of the low\ntechnology requirement.\nAt appraisal, the exchange rate for trading through commercial banks was around NRs\n47-48 per dollar, which was the weighted average of the official rate and the travellers\ncheck rate.\nThe loan ceiling from the Bank under the Project is assumed at 80 per cent of the initial\ninvestment required. Therefore, an additional 10 per cent must be financed by\ncommercial banks or NGOs.", "68\nAppendix 6\nPage 3\n8. Livestock production would typically be for (i) improved much buffalo for milk and\ncalf production, (ii) improved goat production, (iii) improved piggery of two sows, and (iv)\npoultry production with a flock size of 25 birds. Crop production would be for cereal and\nhorticulture crops grown on less than half a hectare of land.\n9. The initial investment would be highest for milch buffalo at NRs 17,600 and lowest\nfor cereals in the Hills at less than NRs 1,000, because the former requires the purchase of\ncostly buffalo, while the latter needs only a small amount of money to buy fertilizers and seeds.\nIt is expected that, after appropriate training, women are willing to take credit for these activities\nbecause the requirement for skills and initial costs are relatively low. Family labor would be\nsufficient for these activities. Livestock purchased may be regarded as a security for the loan.\n2.\t Processing, Manufacturing and Service Industry\n10. The indicative microenterprises expected to be financed under the proposed\nProject would be mainly in the food processing and fabric-based cottage industries. Other\nmicroenterprises identified by the Department of Cottage and Village Industries include the\nmanufacturing of consumer items and subprojects in the services sector.\n11. Currently, the fabric-based industries such as wool spinning, rug and carpet\nweaving, dyeing and sewing are thriving in Nepal because of the strong demand for export and\nfrom tourists. Food processing is equally profitable and can be operated by local women using\nlocally produced crops, fruit and machineries. In addition, a number of business opportunities\nin the service sector exist for women in large cities like Kathmandu. Tea shops and restaurants,\ngrocery stores, laundry services, souvenir shops, etc. could be started by women. It is estimated\nthat the investment costs are lowest in beaten rice and beekeeping at around NRs 7,600, and\nhighest in rug and carpet weaving at over NRs 70,000. Most of these microenterprises are labor\nintensive and suitable for women. Requiring about 2-8 personnel per business, they contribute\nto the creation of employment among poor women and improvement in their incomes.\nD.\t Financial Analysis\n12. Under the identified conditions, most subprojects will be financially attractive. The\nestimated average net annual revenue ranges from NRs 2,600 for beaten rice to NRs 34,000 for\ncarpet weaving (see Table 1). Even after debt service the revenues are all positive. The\naverage revenues after debt service in livestock and vegetable growing are particularly high at\naround NRs 2,000 and would have a significant impact on women's social and economic status,\nconsidering the current poverty line, defined at around NRs 2,500 per person.\n13. The FIRRs range from 23.6 per cent in ginger processing to 61.4 per cent in\npoultry raising. The benefit-cost ratios are also favorable at around 2.0 for all crop activities.\nMost of the subprojects will still be financially viable under unfavorable conditions of decreased\nsales, increased fixed asset costs, increased raw material costs, say by 10 per cent, although\nsome cottage industries that require high fixed investment costs or raw material costs such as\nginger processing, sewing and sock knitting are vulnerable to declines in sales.", "69\nAppendix 6\nPage 4\nE.\t Economic Analysis\n14. Table 3 shows the Economic Internal Rate of Returns (EIRRs) of individual\nsubprojects calculated on the basis of the financial models and a given set ofassumptions\nstated in the footnote. The EIRRs of subprojects range from 13.2 per cent to 34.5 per cent,\nsuggesting that the selected subprojects are economically justifiable. Low EIRRs in some\nsubprojects may be acceptable because this computation does not include other non-\nquantifiable benefits or secondary benefits such as training or secondary employment resulting\nfrom the subprojects.\nF.\t Employment Creation and Net Financial Income\n15. At full development, the Project will have a direct impact on (I) the production of\nfoodgrains, vegetables and livestock products; and (ii) the development of cottage and agro-\nindustries. It will foster the entrepreneurial spirit among women and increase their self-reliance.\nThe new jobs created from the enterprises supported through credit under the Project are\nestimated at 13,800 person-years for self-employment and 11,000 person-years for wage\nemployment, comprising 10,500 person-years in the agriculture sector, 12,300 person-years in\nthe cottage industry sector and 2,000 person-years in the small business sector.

The consultant services under the proposed Project will be required to strengthen\nthe managerial, planning, technical and financial capabilities of selected NGOs so that they can\nprovide better services to women beneficiaries and, in a number of special cases, begin to\nprovide credit services to their members. In line with Project phasing, the headquarters of the\nNGO Support Unit will be established in Kathmandu, but some of the consultants will be based\nin Tulsipur in Dang district during the first three years. However, throughout the life of the\nProject, specialists handling NGO credit will be based in Kathmandu, as the majority of their\nwork is expected to involve national NGOs.\n12. A total of about 156 person-months of consultant services comprising about 18\nperson-months of international consultants and about 138 person-months of local consultants\nwill be required in the following fields of specialization:\nInternational\t Domestic\n\t\nConsultants\t Consultants Total\n(person-months)\n\t\n1.

The PlC will have powers to co-opt additional members if\nrequired. It will meet at least once every quarter. The WDD Undersecretary will be designated\nas Project Manager, since he will be responsible for day-to-day management and\nimplementation of the Project.\n4.3. At the district and municipal levels, the existing WDOs will coordinate and\nsupervise Project activities in cooperation with the district staff of concerned line agencies, and\nwill liaise with the members of the newly formed District Development Committees. Project\nactivities at the village level will be jointly carried out by WWs and local NGOs.

At the end of the first three years of Project implementation, the Government, the\nBank and other lending agencies [particularly Norway and the United Nation Development Fund\nfor Women (UNIFEM)] will carry out a Mid-Term Review of the Project. The Review will assess\nthe progress of Project implementation, the problems and constraints of the Project and the\nprospects for achieving its objectives as envisaged at appraisal. Based on the findings of the\nReview, three decisions will have to be made: (i) changes in Project design and implementation\nto enable the Project staff to improve Project implementation; (ii) expansion of Project activities\nto other districts and towns included in the Project area; and (iii) initiation of credit delivery and\nrecovery under Model B, i.e., using NGOs as financial intermediaries.\nB.\t Terms of Reference\n2.\t The broad terms of reference for the Mid-Term Review will include the following:\n(i) Review all the documents, reports and data related to the Project and its\naccompanying technical assistance (TA) (JSF-assisted TA for Group\nFormation and Training of Women Beneficiaries and UNIFEM-assisted TA\nfor Benefit, Monitoring and Evaluation System) as well as the\nGovernment's policies and regulations on NGOs.\n(ii) Carry out field visits in the districts and towns included in the first phase\nof the Project (Dang, Salyan and Phyuthan districts, and Kathmandu,\nPokhara/Dumre, and Nepalganj) to assess the progress of the Project and\nto identify the problems and constraints faced by the Project staff, NGOs\nand beneficiaries.\n(iii) Assess the performance of Women Development Division (WDD) and\nNGOs in implementing the group formation and training of women\nbeneficiaries financed by JSF. Identify issues and constraints, and\nrecommend how the procedures and intervention strategy can be made\neffective in identifying, organizing and training women beneficiaries.\n(iv) Assess the performance of the NGO Support Unit in improving the\nmanagerial, technical and financial capabilities of local NGOs for\ndelivering microcredit to women beneficiaries and in assisting WDD staff\nto implement the Project activities. Identify issues and constraints, and\nrecommend how the procedures and intervention strategy can be made\neffective.\n(Reference in text: page 23, para.78; page 23, para. 81)", "54\nAppendix 5\nPage 2\n(v) Examine the performance of WDD, Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the\nNGO Support Unit in the development of alternative mechanisms for\ndelivery and recovery of microcredit involving NGOs. Identify issues and\nconstraints, and recommend how the procedures and the intervention\nstrategy can be made effective for the delivery of microcredit to the target\nbeneficiaries through Model A (using the participating banks) or Model B\n(using the NGOs).\n(vi) Based on the review of (i) to (v) above, recommend changes in the\nProject design and implementation with a view to improving the progress\nof the Project. Taking into account the implementation capacity of WDD,\nNRB and NGOs and the accomplishments of the Project, recommend\nwhether the Prolect area should be expanded to nine other districts and\ntwo other towns as envisaged at appraisal, and whether the Project\nshould initiate Model B or continue with Model A.\nPART II: GROUP FORMATION AND TRAINING OF BENEFICIARIES\nA.\t Introduction\n3. While the Project design draws together all agencies currently involved WID\nactivities at the district level, there is limited relevant experience within WDD in the parallel\ndevelopment of Government and NGO WID activities, and in ensuring that curriculum re-\norientation is undertaken for both field staff and women beneficiaries to enable WDD efficiently\nto operate intensive social preparation and income generation activities linked to innovative\nsavings mobilization and credit services within the Project area. It is essential, therefore, that\nspecialist expertise be brought in from the very start of the Project to support WDD in sethng\nup and implementing critical activities, and that institutional strengthening efforts are maintained\nthroughout the implementation period.\n4. Because of the importance of the curriculum development and training efforts to\nWDD and national operations, the specialist team will be based in WDD/Kathmandu but will\noperate up to 40 per cent of its time in the field.\n5. A total of 132 person-months of local consultant services will be required in the\nfollowing fields of specialization:\nDomestic Consultants\n(person-months)\n1. Institutional Development Specialist\t 72\n2. Planning and Training Specialist\t 30\n3. Project Implementation Advisor\n\t\nTotal 132", "40\nAppendix 3\nPage 2\n4. Within WDD an NGO Support Unit, comprising domestic and international\nconsultants, will be established within one year of the effectiveness as an autonomous team\nunder the guidance of the Project Director. Its principal function will be to supply a broad\nspectrum of institutional development and management services to NGO working within the\nProject area. Its principal tasks and responsibilities will be to (I) coordinate and liaise with Social\nWelfare Council (SWC), INGOs and any other agencies handling assistance programs to NGOs\nin the Project area; (ii) undertake and/or contract out surveys within the Project area to identify\nall successful SHGs with potential to develop as NGOs, all functioning registered and non-\nregistered local NGOs, and all branches of other NGOs operating in the Project area, and\nevaluate their suitabilities for institutional strengthening; (iii) provide institutional support to\nSHGs/NGOs selected; (iv) work with local NGOs to encourage the formation of NGO\nCooperation Associations (NGOCAs) at the district level to facilitate the development of groups\nof independent NGOs that can work together as teams to provide a broad spectrum of local\nservices; (v) assist local NGOs in the preparation of proposals for submission to the PBs or the\nApproval Committee (see para. 7); (vi) select, train and supervise local NGOs to work as agents\nof the PBs in the provision of credit to their members or groups of beneficiaries; (vii) in\nconjunction with NRB, design a new standard credit administration/accounting system for NGOs\ntogether with the necessary security and legal regulations, operational manuals and training\nmodules for NGO staff to enable NGOs to act as financial intermediaries; (viii) select and\npropose NGOs successfully operating participating bank agency schemes under (vi) above to\nNRB to provide direct financial intermediary services; (ix) receive and appraise applications for\nloans by NGOs that can be recommended to the Approval Committee; (x) recommend viable\nactivities! enterprises to NGOs and beneficiaries; and (xi) prepare and operate the necessary\ndata base/management information system, and routinely monitor and report on the institutional\nsupport to NGOs component of the Project to the WDD Undersecretary for inclusion in Project\nsix-monthly and annual reports.\n2.\t Nepal Rastra Bank\n5. NRB will be the Executing Agency for the credit component of the Project. NRB\nwill appoint the Chief Manager of the Development Finance Department as its Coordinator. The\nprimary task of NAB will be the provision of lines of credit to participating banks and NGOs for\nonlending to women beneficiaries.\n6. In consultation with the PlC, NRB will (i) work with WDD, the NGO Support Unit,\nand PBs to introduce appropriate systems and procedures for savings mobilization and credit-\nlinked operations in the Project area, using WDD staff and selected NGOs as client introduction\nand supervision agents under Model A (see para. 22); (ii) prepare and adopt an appropriate\nregulatory framework and mechanisms for NGOs to act as financial intermediaries; (iii) work with\nthe NGO Support Unit to introduce, field test and develop a new mechanism for credit delivery\nand recovery involving NGOs under Model B (see para. 22); (iv) establish Approval Committees\nin Kathmandu and Project districts/towns, which will process and approve loan applications from\nNGOs; (v) channel credit funds to participating banks and NGOs and make arrangements to\nreceive repayments; and (vi) monitor the progress of implementation of the credit component\nand prepare reports to the PlC in line with standardized formats required by the Government\nand the Bank.", "Appendix 3\nPage 3\n7. In the event that Model B is adopted after the completion of the Mid-Term Review,\nNRB will establish a National Approval Committee in Kathmandu comprising a representative\nof NRB as chairman, the Director of the PlC and a representative of the Ministry of Finance; and\na District Approval Committee comprising a representative of NRB as chairman, a representative\nof MLD and a representative of the NGO Cooperation Association or other district-level NGO\nassociation (henceforth called the NGO Cooperation Association) within 3 and 6 months,\nrespectively, of the completion of the Mid-Term Review. The NRB representative may be a\nNRB official or a nominee from a commercial bank, depending on the presence of NRB branch\noffices in the Project districts and towns. The Approval COmmittees will decide on the\napplications submitted by NGOs for inclusion in the credit component of the Project. Decisions\nwill be based on the recommendations of the NGO Support Unit. Approved NGOs will be\nrequired to sign a financing agreement with NAB acceptable to the Bank. The Approval\nCommittees will meet as frequently as required, at least once a month after the NGOs start to\napply for loans, to consider the applications submitted by NGOs.\n3.\t Participating Banks\n8. The PBs include the Government-owned Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB) and Nepal\nBank Umited (NBL). These banks have been selected because they have intensive networks\nof branches throughout Nepal and have had considerable experience in providing microcredit\nto the poor under the Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) Program and priority sector\nlending programs. Throughout the Project implementation period the PBs will be credit\nintermediaries under the MOdel A arrangements within the credit component of the Project,\nworking with WDD and NGOs to promote savings mobilization and channeling subloans\nfollowing their current practices to eligible beneficiaries who have received appropriate skills\ntraining either within the Project or from other programs.\n9. RBB and NBL are the oldest banks in Nepal and account for about 72 per cent\nof the resources of the banking system, while ADBN and the three joint venture banks account\nfor the remaining 28 per cent. Between them the two banks have 430 branches, staff strength\nof 11,200, assets amounting to NRs 27 billion and deposits amounting to NRs 21 billion. Almost\n70 per cent of the bank branches are in the rural areas. Rural branches are estimated to\nprovide about 60 per cent of the deposits and generate about 40 per cent of the lending\nbusiness. In view of their extensive branch networks and significance in the overall rural\neconomy, both IFAD and the World Bank have channeled funds through the two banks.\n10. Because of the importance of the two banks to the national economy, the\nGovernment commissioned the Commercial Bank Problem Analysis and Strategy Study\n(CBPASS) and the World Bank to examine the problems confronting the two banks. Data\npublished by NRB indicated that the two banks have incurred heavy losses during the last few\nyears. NBL incurred losses of NRs 801 million in 1991 /92 and NRs 901 million in 1992/93, while\nRBB incurred losses of NRs 662 million in 1991 /92 and NRs 877 million in 1992/93. The major\nfactors contributing to the losses include the following:\nThe composition of the District Approval Committee will be reviewed after the\nGovernment has established District and Village Development Committees in the Project\ndistricts to determine whether a representative of these should be included.", "42\nArpendix 3\nPage 4\n(i) Many of the rural branches are unprofitable because of high overhead\ncosts.\n(ii) Managers and staff require further training and improved motivation.\n(iii) The banks' credit management policies, branch operations, monitoring,\ninformation and accounting systems are not well suited to operating with\na commercial orientation.\n(iv) About one third of outstanding loans and advances are considered bad\ndebt and uncollectible as a result of the combined effects of losses in\nlending to large industrial/commercial firms owned by influential persons,\nand shortcomings in credit analysis and management.\n(v) The banks have inadequate spread as a result of poor quality portfolio\nand high reserve requirements.\n11.\t To improve the performance of RBB and NBL, CBPASS and the World Bank have\nmade the following recommendations:\n(I) The rural branch networks should be rationalized by reducing the\ntransaction costs and closing excess and underutilized rural branches to\nestablish viable branches.\n(ii) Fundamental institutional reforms should be put in place to turn the banks\ninto commercially oriented and profit-maximizing institutions.\n(iii) Credit discipline should be strengthened through establishing an effective\nlegal and administrative system for expeditious resolution of defaults.\n(iv) The two banks should be recapitalized to obtain capital adequacy in line\nwith international standards.\n(v) Financial, intermediation should be improved by lowering reserve\nrequirements and increasing interest rates on reserve assets.\n12. The Government and the banks have recognized the need for corrective actions\nand the Government is heavily committed to improving the performance of RBB and NBL.\nSome actions have already been taken while others are being implemented. Measures which\nhave been taken include increasing paid-up capital, closing loss-incurring branches, reducing\nexcess staff, improving credit analysis, management and supervision, and stopping behest loans\nand other loans based on Government guarantee.\n4.\t Participating NGOs\n13. For the purpose of the Project, NGOs will be defined as private, voluntary,\npolitically neutral, nonprofit organizations committed to helping the disadvantaged, the poor or\nthe needy, legally established and registered with the appropriate authorities. Based on this\ndefinition, NGOs include all private, voluntary organizations or societies organized and owned", "43\nAppendix 3\nPage 5\nindependently of Government agencies, SHGs, user groups, and private research and\ndevelopment organizations registered with the Chief District Office or any other appropriate\nagency of the Borrower.\n14. NGOs will actively participate in the Project as catalysts and intermediaries. Their\nprimary role will be in social preparation and the provision of planning support and development\nservices to their members (Stage I). Subsequently, it is anticipated that many of them will act\nas agents for PB financialservices (Stage II), with some eventually providing direct credit to sub-\nborrowers (Stage Ill). The NGOs will be selected by the NGO Support Unit in consultation with\nWDD and NRB according to the criteria agreed upon between the Government and the Bank\n(see para. 30).\n15. Stage I NGOs will be contracted to (i) assist in surveying the socioeconomic\nconditions in their catchment areas; (ii) undertake activities to create a heightened awareness\namong the target beneficiaries of the real potential of coordinated self-help and assisted\ndevelopment; (iii) institutionalize women's groups, which will become the focus for contact with\nand the provision of educational, health, technical extension, and savings and credit services;\nand (iv) strengthen women's groups to encourage the spirit of purpose and discipline to take\non credible viable income-generating activities both for the group and individual beneficiaries.\nTo strengthen the effectiveness of such NGO operations, participating Stage I NGOs will be\nencouraged to join NGOCAs at the district and municipality levels. The NGOCAs will bring\ntogether both national/regional NGOs operating in the concerned area and local-based NGOs.\nThe objectives of the establishment of such associations are (I) to foster inter-NGO support; and\n(ii) to promote the sharing of managerial and planning skills and to generate the widest possible\ncoverage of NGO services at the, local level. Membership in such associations will not be\ncompulsory.\n16. Stage I NGOs that demonstrate management competence, an understanding of\nthe concepts involved in developing income-generating activities and an ability to operate\nsavings mobilization programs effectively within their membership will be encouraged to become\nCredit Agents for the PBs (Stage II NGOs). No time restriction is proposed for initial successful\nStage I operations, as many NGOs have already demonstrated such potential. Selection of\nsuch NGOs will be undertaken jointly by the NGO Support Unit and the appropriate PB. Stage\nII NGOs will receive training for their staff in simple administration and credit accounting,\nsubloan project appraisal, noncollateralized security systems based principally on group liability,\nand loan supervision and recovery. Such training will be undertaken together with local PB\nofficials to promote understanding of their varying field roles.\n17. Subject to the acceptance of their members and a minimum of one year of\nsatisfactory operation as PB Credit Agents, Stage II NGOs will qualify for consideration by NRB\nas future direct financial intermediaries. The responsibility for selection as Stage Ill NGOs will\nlie with the NGO Support Unit in consultation with NRB and WDD using the criteria agreed to\nbetween the Government and the Bank. Stage Ill NGOs will be required to use the\nadministrative and accounting systems recommended by the NGO Support Unit and NRB to\nassist in the future development of a single national NGO Direct Financial Intermediary System.", "44\nAppendix 3\nPage 6\n18. Each NGO will proceed through the development process at its own pace. Some\nwell-established NGOs that have had satisfactory prior experience with delivery of financial\nservices to beneficiaries may proceed from Stage I to Stage Ill directly, while others may have\nto go through the three stages in a systematic manner.\nC.\t Financing Arrangements\nLending, Relending and Onlending Arrangements\n19. The proceeds of the Bank loan attributable to the credit component of the Project\nwill be relent to PBs and participating NGOs. The Bank's loan will finance up to 80 per cent of\nthe total cost of each subproject. The PBs or NGOs will provide 10 per cent and the\nbeneficiaries another 10 per cent either in cash, kind or labor. However, the contribution of\nNGOs toward the cost of subprojects will be reduced to a minimum of 5 per cent if the local\nNOOs have inadequate financial resources to provide the required 10 per cent. It is anticipated\nthat during the first three years of Project implementation, Bank loan proceeds will be relent to\nPBs, which will include RBB and NBL under Model A. Other banks as approved by the\nGovernment arid the Bank may be invited to participate if this proves advantageous with respect\nto increased disbursement rate, geographical accessibility or beneficiary preference. NGOs and\nWDD staff will assist in mobilizing beneficiaries to borrow from the PBs by assisting beneficiaries\nto prepare subloan applications and carrying out credit supervision activities. In the latter part\nof Project implementation, these proceeds will also be lent to duly selected and accredited\nNGOs under Model B.\n20. The Government and NRB will enter into a suitable administrative arrangement\nto regulate the terms upon which NRB, as the agent of the Government, will relend the proceeds\nof the Bank loan attributable to the credit component. NRB will enter into financing agreements\nwith the PBs and with selected and accredited NGOs. Subsidiary loans will be made on the\nbasis of an acceptable pipeline of subprojects, and will bear an annual interest rate of 6 per\ncent. Repayment periods will vary depending on the nature of the subprojects to be financed,\nbut will not exceed 15 years, inclusive of a grace period of not more than 3 years. As the\nrepayment periods of the subsidiary loans from PBs/NGOs to NRB will exceed in most cases\nthose of the subloans, the PBs/NGOs are expected to recycle the repayments made by\nbeneficiaries either in support of other sub-borrowers or for repeat loans.\n21. The financing agreements will specify that the PBs and NGOs will onlend the\nproceeds of the loans, together with their own funds, to beneficiaries at a minimum of 17 per\ncent per annum, which is the prevailing commercial bank lending rate in Nepal, to allow an\ninterest spread of at least 11 per cent. This spread is required to cover the high costs of\nintermediation and supervision of microcredit, provision of bad debts and a small profit margin.\nIn addition, under Model A part of the interest margin will be passed on to NGOs for their\nservices as credit agents to the PBs. Under the ongoing International Fund for Agricultural\nDevelopment (IFAD) financed PCRW project, the Government is allowing a 13 per cent margin\non average to PBs. The PBs and NGOs will bear the credit risk of the subloans. The subloans\nwill be made to women beneficiaries as individuals or as groups. In appropriate cases,\nindividual members of the group will be jointly and severally liable for the repayment obligations\nof each individual. Further security will not be required except in cases where it is appropriate\nto create security over assets financed by a subloan.", "45\nAppendix 3\nPage 7\n2.\t Mechanisms for Credit Deliveyr and Recovery\n22. Under the Project, there will be two mechanisms for credit delivery and recovery.\nIn the first mechanism (called Model A), NRB will relend a part of the Bank loan proceeds to the\nPBs, which will onlend directly to sub-borrowers (women beneficiaries). In the second\nmechanism (called Model B), NRB will relend a portion of the loan proceeds to NGOs for\nonlending to sub-borrowers (women beneficiaries) where the NGOs are willing and are\nexperienced in fulfilling the financial services function.\n23. The ultimate objective of the Project is to develop alternative channels for delivery\nof financial services involving NGOs (i.e., Model B). However, since the level of development\nof NGOs in Nepal is still at an early stage compared with NGOs in other Asian countries, it is\nnecessary in the initial years of the Project to strengthen the selected NGOs in the appropriate\nareas so that in later years, the Project beneficiaries will be able to obtain financial services\neither from the PBs (Model A) or from NGOs (Model B). To facilitate the delivery of financial\nservices involving NGOs, the Government has proposed to introduce legislation or regulations\nto govern the activities of NGOs. The Bank will be kept informed of the proposals. In particular,\nthe Government will, within one year of the effectivehess, adopt a policy including proposals for\nlegislation, to promote the participation of NGOs in the development process. This policy will\ninclude measures to simplify the registration procedures for NGOs, to develop a regulatory\nframework and a specific mechanism to enable NGOs to act as financial intermediaries, to\nreorient the functions of SWC as a facilitator of the activities of NGOs, and to introduce\nmechanisms for collaboration between local NGOs and international NGOs.\n24. The Government and NRB confirmed to the Mission that, while the existing legal\nand regulatory framework is undeveloped, there is no impediment to NGOs participating in the\nProject provided that they are duly registered with the appropriate authorities. In particular,\nNGOs may act as financial intermediaries after receiving the consent of NRB (acting in its\ngeneral central banking role as regulator of credit activities). NRB confirmed that such consent\nhad been given to NGOs in the past and that they did not anticipate difficulties in granting\nconsent in the future for the purposes of the Project. However, it is clear that financial\nintermediation by NGOs would be promoted by the development of a more detailed framework\nto regulate in the financial activities, including the establishment of systems for streamlined\napproval and monitoring procedures. The Mission suggested that such measures could be\nadopted by means of amendments to the Association Registration Act and by regulations made\nunder the Nepal Rastra Bank Act. The Government has agreed that such measures will be\nadopted before credit is disbursed by NGOs under the Project (although this would of course\nnot affect disbursement of credit by the PBs).\n3.\t Credit Delivery and Recovery System Under Model A\n25. Under Model A, the WDOs and WWs of MLD, together with local NGOs, will work\nclosely with Project beneficiaries throughout the period of the Project. The involvement of local\nNGOs will supplement MLDs activities, as it faces personnel and other resource constraints.\nThe WDOs, WWs and NGOs will organize the beneficiaries into cohesive groups and provide\nthem with skills training in cooperation with other agencies/projects. After the beneficiaries have\nsuccessfully completed the training program, they will be assisted in obtaining credit from the", "46\nAppendix 3\nPage 8\nlocal offices of the selected PB. Financing agreements acceptable to the Bank will be signed\nbetween NRB and the PBs under the Project, and the credit program of the PBs will be funded\nusing the Bank loan proceeds in accordance with these agreements.\n26. The PBs will improve their current standards with respect to loan appraisal for\nloans under the Project as recommended by CBPASS and the World Bank. WDD staff or Stage\nII NGOs will assist the PBs as credit agents. The WDD staff or NGO will have established a\nclose relationship with the prospective beneficiary through the group formation and training\nprocess and will be well placed to assist both the beneficiary with the application process and\nthe PB with appraisal and follow-up. The exact nature of the relationship between the PB and\nthe NGO, including agency and supervision fees or other compensation, if any, will be\nnegotiated between them.\n4.\t Delivery and Recovery System under Model B\n(a)\t Phasing of Proiect Activities\n27. During the first three years of the Project, credit will be delivered to women\nbeneficiaries by the PBs under Model A. During the next three years of Project implementation,\ncredit may be delivered to women beneficiaries by both Model A and Model B, subject to\napproval of the Government and Bank after the Mid-Term Review of the Project.\n(b)\t Approval Procedures for NGO Loans\n28. The approval procedures for loans to NGOs will be as follows: (i) loans to NGOs\nup to the amount of NRs 500,000 can be approved by the District Approval Committee; (ii) loans\nto NGOs up to the amounts of NRs 5;000,000 can be approved by the National Approval\nCommittee; (iii) a decision on the approval of loan requests will be taken up by the Approval\nCommittee concerned within four weeks after submission of the loan request; and (iv) a NGO\nmay receive a repeat loan only after it has disbursed 75 per cent of its immediately preceding\nloan and has satisfactorily complied with its existing obligations.\n(c)\t Financing Agreement\n29. The financing agreement to be executed between NAB and the NGO upon\napproval of the application by the Approval Committee should indicate the relending terms and\nconditions; the repayment and grace periods; the purpose for which the loan is made; reporting,\naccounting and auditing requirements; the right of NRB to initiate legal action to enforce\ncompliance with the terms of the agreement; and such other provisions as may be agreed upon\nby the Government and the Bank.\n(d)\t Selection Criteria of NGOs\n30. In consultation with WDD and NRB, the NGO Support Unit will select the NGOs\nthat will act as financial intermediaries. The eligibility of NGOs to act as financial intermediaries\nunder the Project will be determined on the basis of two sets of selection criteria. The first will\ndetermine whether the NGOs qualify for the institutional support to be provided under the\nProject. The second will determine whether NGOs can be used to provide credit directly to\nbeneficiaries. The first set of criteria includes the following:", "47\nAppendix 3\nPage 9\n(I)\t be registered with the concerned Chief District Office or any other\nappropriate agency of the Borrower to establish the NGO as a legal entity;\n(ii) have had at least one year of experience in social mobilization or other\ncommunity development work and a minimum coverage of 100\nbeneficiaries;\n(iii) have at least two administrative staff and a permanent office to handle the\nlending program;\n(iv) show high commitment to improve the socioeconomic status of women;\nand\n(v) have established locally based or district-based operations.\n31. After the strengthening phase of at least one year, the performance of the NGOs\nwill be evaluated under the following additional criteria to determine whether they are qualified\nto act as financial intermediaries:\n(i) key officers and staff of the NGOs have satisfactorily completed training\nfor NGO strengthening under the Project, or have availed of similar\nassistance provided by other entities;\n(ii) be willing to submit to external financial and administrative spot checking\nby NRB and the NGO Support Unit;\n(iii) demonstrate capability to perform basic subloan. appraisal following the\nprovision of short-term training under the Project;\n(iv) have adequate power under its constitution to borrow and lend money;\n(v) have had some financial service experience through assisting PBs in\nProject subloan follow-up- and supervision and mobilizing beneficiary\nsavings; and\n(vi) have agreed in writing with the PlC regarding arrangements for training\nof sub-borrowers, including social preparation activities, and savings or\ncapital build-up (CBU) arrangements, including details of the means of\nraising capital, allowed application of funds and custody and control\nprocedures.\n(e)\t ProcessinQ of Subloans from NGOs to Beneficiaries\n32. NGOs will make subloans to women beneficiaries who fulfill the following criteria\nand such other criteria as the Government and the Bank may agree upon the beneficiaries\nshould (i) either belong to a low-income group falling under the Government-defined poverty\nline, or be able to enhance labor-intensive employment by creating jobs for women belonging\nto the low-income group; (ii) have completed skills training provided by the Project or by other", "48\nAppendix 3\nPage 10\nprojects; (iii) be residents of the area where the subproject is to be undertaken; (iv) have no\nrecord of default with any commercial bank or other formal financial institution in Nepal, and (v)\nbe members of SHGs that have initiated savings mobilization activities.\n33. A subproject proposal submitted by a beneficiary or a group of beneficiaries\nshould satisfy the following requirements: (i) the subloan request does not exceed NRs 30,000\nper sub-borrower for agricultural production credit, NRs 40,000 per sub-borrower for\nmicroenterprise credit or NRs 250,000 per sub-borrower for small business credit; (ii) the\nsubproject is technically and financially viable and there are sufficient available raw materials\nand markets for finished products that its viability is not endangered; (iii) the sub-borrower for\nsuch subproject will provide at least 10 per cent of the subproject cost in cash or kind including\nlabor; (iv) the subproject should yield a financial internal rate of return exceeding the cost of\ncapital; and (v) the subproject is labor-intensive and environmentally friendly.\n34. To ensure sustainability of the micro-enterprises, NGOs will be allowed to grant\nrepeat loans to the beneficiaries up to the ceilings specified.\n35. The onlending agreement to be executed by NGOs and sub-borrowers upon\napproval of the subloan will include provisions for onlending terms and conditions; the\nrepayment period; the purpose for which the subloan is made; appropriate accounting\nobligations; CBU obligations; the right of the NGOs to initiate legal action to enforce compliance\nwith the terms of the onlending agreement; and such other provisions as may be agreed upon\nby the Government, the NGOs and the Bank.\n5.\t Savings Mobilization and Credit Guarantee\n36. NGOs are expected under the Project to include a savings mobilization\ncomponent in their programs of assistance to beneficiary groups in addition to any savings\nprogram for self-insurance purposes, either through compulsory periodic savings, voluntary\nsavings up to a minimum percentage of the requested loan amount, surplus interest charges\nor other agreed means. Savings thus mobilized may be in the name of the individual borrowers\nor the beneficiary group, and should be deposited in the local banks. Accumulated savings or\nCBU!' may be used as sub-borrower contribution, loan collateral, beneficiary loan fund or other\nagreed upon purpose. Stage Ill NGOs will agree in writing with the NGO Support Unit regarding\nsavings or CBU arrangements, details of the means of raising capital, interest rates, allowed\napplication of funds, and custody and control procedures. This arrangement will ensure that\n(i) beneficiaries will be able to repay their loans to NGOs, and (ii) NGOs will be able to\ncontribute at least 5 per cent of the total cost of subprojects (see para. 19).\n37. Loans to beneficiaries may be insured with the Credit Guarantee Corporation, with\nthe PBs or NGOs financing the insurance premium cost from the indicated interest spread\nwithout further charge to the sub-borrowers. Currently the premium is 0.25 per cent of the\noutstanding loan balance per quarter. However, the premium for livestock loans is 10 per cent\nof the outstanding balance with 5 per cent subsidized by the Government. Alternatively or in\naddition, at the option of the beneficiaries, group savings may be mobilized to finance a fund\nA surcharge of a minimum of 2 per cent on top of the onlending rate charged by the\nparticipating NGOs to subborrowers seems to be justified in order to establish a CBU.", "49\nAppendix 3\nPage 11\nto self-insure the loans of the beneficiaries in the group. This fund would then be an asset of\nthe group and would be managed accordingly by the group. Similarly, livestock loans could\nbe insured through savings mobilized at the group level. In this case, coverage of livestock\nloans under the Credit Guarantee Corporation scheme may not be required.\nD.\t Beneficiary Participation\n38. The Project was formulated through an extensive consultation process with\nintended beneficiaries, a number of potential participating NGOs and aid  agencies.!' The\nBank's Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Bank Operations was used in\nassessing the potential beneficiaries in the Project area. During Project implementation,\nbeneficiary participation will be ensured through the following measures: (i) beneficiary\nmobilization and awareness raising through group formation; (ii) bottom-up needs assessment\nand planning process, especially at the district level; (iii) use of NGOs as change agents and\ndelivery channels of services and resources; and (iv) capability building of NGOs and WDD staff\nto serve target beneficiaries better.\n39. Social preparation, i.e., mobilizing beneficiaries and raising awareness for\npotential socioeconomic development (value-formation) is an essential part of the Project\nactivities. Such interventions are considered prerequisites to any human resource development\nand investment programs targeting marginal beneficiaries, especially women. Beneficiary needs\nassessment will be conducted by WDD staff and NGOs through a participatory process.\nFeedback from beneficiaries will be fully reflected in the design of a package of social service\nassistance (such as literacy classes) followed by skills and management training for income\ngeneration.\n40. The involvement of NGOs in Project implementation will enhance beneficiary\nparticipation and the bottom-up planning process. Because of their grassroot orientation and\nfocused but flexible approach, NGOs generally possess a comparative advantage to deliver\nservices and resources effectively to intended beneficiaries. The Project has been designed to\npromote the role of NGOs to complement the community work currently undertaken by\nGovernment agencies; and selected NGOs will supplement the channeling of financial resources\nto meet the demands of women beneficiaries for their income-generating activities.\nE.\t Proiect Management and Coordination\nProject Implementation Committee\n41. The Government will establish a PlC to ensure centralized leadership and close\ncoordination among the Project entities. The establishment of the PlC will be a condition for\nloan effectiveness. tts tasks and responsibilities will include but not be limited to (i) coordination\nof the work plans of the Executing Agencies; (ii) liaison with Government line ministries and\nparticipating external aid agencies involved in complementary WID and NGO programs, both\ninside and outside the Project area; (iii) supervision of the appointment and subsequent\nConsultation meetings with some 40 NGOs and about 15 aid agencies, and extensive\nfield trips and discussions with potential beneficiaries were undertaken during the loan\nfact-finding and loan appraisal stages.", "30\nsupported by the Project will not only improve the delivery of services and resources to target\nbeneficiaries, but will also contribute to their long-term viability and sustainability. In the long\nrun, the Project will improve the ability of local NGOs to assist the Government in implementing\nWID programs and other poverty reduction programs in rural and urban areas.\nVI. ASSURANCES\nA.\t Specific Assurances\n108.\t The Government has given the following assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i) Improvement of Training Facilities. The Borrower will, in consultation\nwith the Bank, develop and implement procedures for the operation of\nWTCs, including (a) the introduction of revised curricula for appropriate\nskills training for rural women and in-service training of trainers, WDOs\nand WWs; (b) the introduction of follow-up field courses for trainees\nincluding, where appropriate, the provision of liaison arrangements with\nfinancial intermediaries; and (c) measures to enable the WTCs to\nfunction as multi-user facilities available at cost to public authorities and\nNGOs, thereby increasing utilization.\n(ii) Staffing. The Borrower, through MLD and in consultation with the Bank,\nwill maintain or create sufficient permanent position (a) for a WDO in the\nDistrict Headquarters within the organization of Local Development\nOffices of MLD in the Project area, and (b) for WWs in each village in\nwhich the P\u00f3ject activities are carried out.\n(iii) Regulation of NGOs. The Borrower will keep the Bank informed at all\ntimes of proposals to introduce legislation or regulations to govern the\nactivities of NGOs. In particular, the Borrower will, within one year of\nthe effectiveness, adopt a policy, including proposals for legislation, to\npromote the participation of NGOs in the development process. This\npolicy will include measures to (a) simplify the registration procedures\nfor NGOs, including the adoption of a recognized definition of NGOs for\nthe purpose of registration with the competent authorities; (b) develop\na regulatory framework and specific mechanisms to enable NGOs to act\nas financial intermediaries; (c) identify the functions of SWC as a\nfacilitator of the activities of NGOs, with responsibility for monitoring and\naudit of NGOs; and (d) introduce mechanisms for collaboration between\nlocal NGOs and international NGOs. In addition, as a condition for\ndisbursement of funds to NGOs for credit operations, the Borrower will\nhave adopted appropriate legislation or regulations to provide specific\nmechanisms for the delivery of credit by NGOs.\n(iv) Approval by NRB of Financing Agreements. The Borrower will ensure\nthat NRB, in consultation as necessary with other agencies, adopts\nsimplified procedures, including the identification of any information to", "31\nbe required as part of an application, to enable decisions to be reached\nwithin a reasonable period of time on applications by NGOs for\npermission to lend and borrow money. The Borrower will ensure that\naccreditation of NGOs constitutes approval by NAB for such NGOs to\nlend and borrow money.\n(v) Mid-Term Review. The Borrower, the Bank and the Government of\nNorway will conduct a comprehensive mid-term review of all aspects of\nProject implementation within three years of the effectiveness. This\nreview will include an assessment of the progress of the Project, the\ndevelopment of the Borrower's policy on promotion and regulation of\nactivities of NGOs, and the capacity of NGOs to act as financial\nintermediaries. Based on the outcome of the review, the Borrower and\nthe Bank, in consultation with the Government of Norway and other aid\nagencies, will decide whether to utilize Model B, in addition to Model A,\nfor the remainder of the Project. The review will recommend in\nparticular any necessary changes to organizational and institutional\nstructures to improve Project implementation and any appropriate\nexpansion of Project activities within the Project area beyond the initial\nphase.\n(vi) Project Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation. MLD will, within one year of\nthe effectiveness, appoint five experienced field officers as program\nofficers, based in Kathmandu, to supervise and provide technical\nsupport to WDOs by means of regular and more frequent visits to the\nProject area. WDD will be responsible, in accordance with\narrangements satisfactory to the Bank, for monitoring Project\nimplementation and evaluating Project benefits. In particular, WDD, in\nconsultation with UNIFEM, will carry out initial baseline surveys ol\nbeneficiaries and will engage NGOs and appropriate local individuals\nand institutions to assess the impact of the Project on beneficiaries.\nWDD will be responsible for verification and analysis of the information\ncollected by NGOs, individuals and institutions.\nB.\t Conditions of Loan Effectiveness\n109. The Borrower will have established a PlC within WDD, headed by the Joint\nSecretary in charge of WDD as Project Director; and entered into arrangements satisfactory to\nthe Bank for the provision of the Norwegian grant or alternative funds to finance Part B of the\nProject.", "32\nVII. RECOMMENDATION\n110. I am satisfied that the proposed loan, technical assistance, and administration\nof Norwegian co-financing would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and\nrecommend that the Board approve:\n(i) the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights\n3,544,000 to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Microcredit Project for\nWomen, with a service charge at the rate of 1 per cent per annum and\nwith an amortization of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years\nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance\nwith those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board;\n(ii) the technical assistance of $900,000 equivalent to His Majesty's\nGovern ment of Nepal for the Group Formation and Training of Women\nBeneficiaries on a grant basis; and\n(iii) administration by the Bank of the grant of $2.0 million equivalent from\nthe Government of Norway for the Institutional Support to NGO\ncomponent of the Project.\nKIMIMASA TARUMIZU\nPresident\nDate: 1 June 1993", "33\nAPPENDIXES\nA.

The Women Development Division WDD) under the Ministry of Local\nDevelopment (MLD) will be the main Executing Agency for the group formation and training of\nwomen beneficiaries and non-government institution (NGO) institutional support components\nof the Project, while Nepal Rastra Bank (Central Bank of Nepal or NRB) will be the main\nExecuting Agency for the credit component, with the assistance of the participating banks (PBs)\nand concerned NGOs. The selected NGOs will also assist WDD in implementing the group\nformation and training of women beneficiaries.\nB.\t Implementation Arrangements\n1.\t Women Development Division\n2. WDD/MLD will take overall responsibility for reporting and benefit monitoring and\nevaluation (BME). The WDD Undersecretary in charge of special program assistance will be the\nCoordinator for the two components. The Project will be implemented through the existing\nadministrative structure of MLD at the national and district levels. At the national leve', WDD will\nbe supported with a Project Implementation Committee (PFC) with a secretariat staffed by WDD.\nThe PlC, chaired by the Project Director, will act as a focal point for overall Project management\nand coordination (see para. 41). At the district level, Women Development Officers (WDOs) will\ncoordinate the activities of the Project with NGOs and Government agencies through the District\nDevelopment Committees. At the village level, Women Workers (WWs) of WDD will be\nresponsible for identification, mobilization and training of women beneficiaries in cooperation\nwith selected NGOs. To facilitate the coordination of Project activities at the district level, WDD\nwill cause WDOs to maintain accounts for counterpart funds provided by the Borrower.\n3. The principal tasks and responsibilities of WDD will involve (i) posting of WDOs\nand WWs in the Project area and provision of appropriate curriculum development and in-\nservice training of its staff to meet Project implementation needs; (ii) preparation of inventory on\nongoing training programs carried out in districts and municipalities, the availability of fixed and\nmobile training facilities, and the number and location of beneficiaries who have obtained\nappropriate skills or business development traihing and are potential recipients for follow-up\ncredit and support assistance; (iii) curriculum development and beneficiary training in social\npreparation, self-help group (SHG) formation, savings mobilization, and appropriate practical\nskills and simple business operations; (iv) coordination with the NGO Support Unit for providing\ninstitutional support to NGOs; (v) liaison with line ministries, bilateral and multilateral agencies,\ninternational NGOs, PBs and District Development Committees on the integration of the Project\ninto local area development programs; and (vi) preparation of semiannual progress reports and\nthe completion of BME studies to meet the needs of the Government, the Bank and the United\nNations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Some of these activities will be assisted by\nconsultants.\n(References in text: page 19, para. 69; page 20, para. 71;\npage 22, para. 76; page 26, para. 93)", "20\n71. While WDD is implementing the group formation and training of beneficiaries,\nthere will be a parallel activity to strengthen the management, accounting, planning and\nimplementation capacities of selected NGOs. The Project will also support the development\nof grassroot organizations including SHGs to become viable NGOs. The strengthening of local\nNGOs will be carried by the NGO Support Unit!' in three stages. Following the identification\nof NGOs and SHGs through detailed surveys of NGOs in the Project area, NGOs will be\nselected on the basis of agreed upon criteria (see Appendix 3) and given training to assist\nWDD in social preparation and the provision of planning support and development services to\nwomen beneficiaries (Stage I). Subsequently (Stage II), it is anticipated that a number of the\nbetter working NGOs will be selected to act as agents for participating banks' financial services\nin channelling financial services. These NGOs will be provided training in subproject appraisal,\nfinancial analysis and loan performance monitoring. Eventually, during Stage lii, some of the\nStage Il NGOs will be selected on the basis of strict eligibility criteria to provide direct credit\nto sub-borrowers. The selected NGOs that have received appropriate training will actively\nparticipate in Project implementation as catalysts and intermediaries, with the ultimate\nobjectives of reducing the workload of WDD field staff in Project implementation and expanding\nthe coverage of the Project to other villages within a given district.\n72. After the beneficiaries have received skills training under the Project or similar\nprojects, WDD field staff will help them to obtain microcredit from the participating banks (PBs)\nwhich include RBB and NBL. However, the role of WDD in the preparation of credit\napplications, and credit supervision and coordination will be gradually taken over by NGOs,\nas there are well trained Stage II NGOs capable of acting as credit agents for the PBs. In this\nway, NGOs will gain experience in financial services, which will help them to qualify as future\ndirect financial intermediaries. Thus, under the Project there will be two mechanisms for credit\ndelivery and recovery. In the first mechanism (called Model A), NAB will relend a part of Bank\nloan proceeds to the PBs, which will onlend directly to sub-borrowers (women beneficiaries).\nIn the second mechanism (called Model B), NRB will relend a portion of the loan proceeds to\nNGOs for onlending to sub-borrowers where NGOs are willing and are experienced in fulfilling\nthe financial services function. However, since most NGOs in Nepal are at present in the\nnascent stage, during the first three years of implementation, the Project will focus on\nstrengthening NGOs, and with respect to credit, will use the PBs as financial intermediaries in\naccord with the existing PCRW model (Model A). At the end of the third year, a comprehensive\nmid-term review will be carried out of the progress of the Project, the development of the\nBorrower's policy on promotion and regulation of NGOs' activities, and thecapacity of NGOs\nto act as financial intermediaries - based on which the Government and the Bank will decide\nwhether to utilize NGOs as financial intermediaries under Model B, in addition to Model A. This\nstaged approach will minimize the risks of involving NGOs in the delivery and recovery of\nmicrocredit to women beneficiaries, since Model B will be used under the Project only if the\nresults of the mid-term review are satisfactory.\nThe NGO Support Unit comprising domestic and international consultants will be\nestablished within WDD as an autonomous team under the guidance of the Project\nDirector.", "21\n73. The Project activities at the village level will be jointly carried out by WWs and\nlocal NGOs, while the activities in the urban areas (towns) will be implemented mainly by\nNGOs using support services oftered by the Executive Officers of municipalities under MLD and\nSBPP. The activities will be coordinated at two levels. At the central level, the Government will\nestablish a Project Implementation Committee (PlC) to ensure centralized leadership and close\ncoordination among Project entities. The establishment of the PlC will be a condition for loan\neffectiveness. The PlC will be chaired by the Joint Secretary of MLD in charge of WDD, who\nwill serve as Project Director, and will comprise the WDD Undersecretary, the Chief Manager\nof the Development Finance Department of NRB, the Team Leader of the NGO Support Unit\nand representatives of the PBs. At the district level, WDO will coordinate the Project activities\nwith the District Development Committee, other Government agencies and the NGOs. Within\na district, WDOs will coordinate Project activities in both villages and urban areas. The\nGovernment will appoint the Undersecretary of WDD as Project Manager, who will be\nresponsibile for day-to-day implementation and management of the Project. He will be\nassisted by several program officers, who will work for the Project on a full-time basis. The\nexisting WDD Central Advisory Board chaired by the Secretary of MLD will provide policy\nguidance for the Project.\n2.\t Financing Arrangements\n74. The proceeds of the Bank loan attributable to the noncredit component will be\nchannelled to WDD through regular budgetary transfers, while the proceeds of the Bank loan\nattributable to the credit component of the Project will be relent by NRB to PBs, and\nparticipating NGOs. The Bank's loan will finance up to 80 per cent of the total cost of each\nsubproject. The PBs or NGOs will provide 10 per cent and the beneficiaries another 10 per\ncent either in cash, kind or in labOr. However, the contribution of NGOs toward the cost of\nsubprojects will be reduced to a minimum of 5 per cent if the local NGOs have inadequate\nfinancial resources to provide the required 10 per cent of the total cost of subprojects. It is\nanticipated that, during the first three years of Project implementation, Bank loan proceeds will\nbe relent to PBs, which will include RBB and NBL under Model A. Other banks!f as approved\nby the Government and the Bank may be invited to participate if this proves advantageous with\nrespect to increased disbursement rate, geographical accessibility or beneficiary preference.\nNGOs and WDD staff will assist in mobilizing beneficiaries to borrow from the PBs by assisting\nthem in preparing subloan applications and by carrying out credit supervision activities. In the\nlatter part of Project implementation, these proceeds will also be lent to duly selected and\naccredited NGOs under Model B in the event that Model B is adopted by the Government and\nthe Bank after completion of the Mid-Term Review of the Project.\n75. The Government and NRB will enter into a suitable administrative arrangement\nto regulate the terms upon which NRB, as the agent of the Government, will relend the\nproceeds of the Bank Loan attributable to the credit component. NRB will enter into financing\nagreements with the PBs and with selected and accredited NGOs. Subsidiary loans will be\nmade on the basis of an acceptable pipeline of subprojects, and will bear an annual interest\nThese banks may include the Eastern Rural Development Bank and Far Western Rural\nDevelopment Bank which will be established by the Government in July 1993.", "22\nrate of 6 per cent. Repayment periods will vary depending on the nature of the subprojects\nto be financed, but will not exceed 15 years, inclusive of a grace period of not more than 3\nyears. As the repayment periods of the subsidiary loans from PBs/NGOs to NRB will exceed\nin most cases those of the subloans, PBs/NGOs are expected to recycle the repayments made\nby beneficiaries either in support of other sub-borrowers or for repeat loans.\n76. The financing agreements will specify that the PBs and NGOs will onlend the\nproceeds of the loans, together with their own funds, to beneficiaries at a minimum of 17 per\ncent per annum, which is the prevailing commercial bank lending rate in Nepal, to allow an\ninterest spread of at least 11 per cent. This spread is required to cover the high costs of\nintermediation and supervision of microcredit, premium for any guarantee fee that might be\npayable by financial intermediaries, provision for bad debts and a small profit margin. In\naddition, under Model A, part of the interest margin wilt be passed on to the NGOs for their\nservices as credit agents to the PBs. The interest spread under the Project is comparable to\nthe spread of 13 per cent provided under the ongoing IFAD-financed PCRW. The PBs and\nNGOs will bear the credit risk of the subloans. The subloans will be made on specific terms\nand conditions and will be processed in accordance with the agreed upon procedures (see\nAppendix 3). The subloans will be made to women beneficiaries as individuals or as groups.\nIn appropriate cases, individual members of the group will be jointly and severally liable for\nrepayment obligations of each individual. Further security will not be required except in cases\nwhere it is appropriate to create security over assets financed bya subloan. Further details\non financing arrangements are given in Appendix 3.\n3.\t Environmental Aspects\n77. Given the nature of the Project, which supports small-scale economic activities\nby poor women, the Project is not expected to have significant adverse environmental impacts,\nand therefore it has been classified as a category C project. Nevertheless, the Project will take\nmeasures to avoid negative environmental impacts through training of beneficiaries and NGOs.\nThe skills-training activities for women's groups and institutional support to NGO component\nwill include courses on sound environmental practices such as selection of crop mixtures that\ncan both generate cash income and improve soil fertility, and proper feeding and management\nof livestock to reduce overgrazing and deforestation. The environmental training extended to\nNGOs wiH assist them in making better choices among subprojects to be financed under the\nProject. If warranted, the Borrower will conduct, prior to the provision of a subloan, an initial\nenvironmental examination and environmental impact assessment according to environmental\nrules and regulations in the country.\n4.\t Project Implementation Schedule\n78.\t The Project will be implemented over a period of six years in a phased manner\n(see Appendix 4). During the first phase of about three years, Project activities will focus on\n\u2022 -- preparatory work such as establishment of the NGO Support Unit; survey of NGOs in all the\nProject districts and towns; selection and accreditation of NGOs; training of WDD staff, NGO\nstaff and women beneficiaries; and detailed design and improvement works for the WTCs and\nTMPC. At the same time, the mechanism for delivery of credit through PBs under Model A will\nbe used and refined in Dang, Pyuthan and Salyan districts and in the major towns of\nKathmandu, Pokhara/Dumre and Nepalganj. These activities will be closely monitored and", "23\nreviewed by WDD/MLD and the Bank every year. A comprehensive Mid-Term Review will be\ncarried out by the Government, the Bank and other agencies (particularly Norway and UNIFEM)\nat the end of the first three years of Project implementation. The terms of reference for the Mid-\nTerm Review are given in Appendix 5. Based on the findings of this review, adjustments in\nProject design and implementation will be considered, and, a decision whether to utilize the\ncredit delivery and recovery under Model B, in addition to Model A, and to expand the Project\narea to other districts and towns will be made by the Government and the Bank. During the\nsecond phase (years 4-6), proven concepts and activities will be expanded to the other nine\ndistricts and two towns in the Project area, but there will be flexibility in the final selection of\ndistricts and towns based on the results of the Mid-Term Review.\n5.\t Procurement\n79. In view of the multiplicity of small sub-borrowers and the diverse nature of\ngoods and services to be procured under the credit component, international competitive\nbidding, international shopping or local competitive bidding are not expected to be economic\nor efficient. Accordingly, most procurement will be done according to normal commercial\nprocedures through direct purchase by the sub-borrowers, in accordance with paragraph 3.08.\nof the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement - Purchase of Equipment for Use of Small Private\nSub-borrowers\".\n80. The civil works related to the rehabilitation and improvement of the WTCs will\nbe carried out on the basis of local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank\nsince the works are relatively simple and dispersed widely over the Project area, and it is\nunlikely that international contractors will be interested to bid. Equipment and vehicles required\nby the Project will be procured mainly on the basis of international shopping and, in some\ncases, through direct purchase procedures. The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement will be\nused in the procurement of civil works and equipment.\n6.\t Consulting Services\n81. The services of local and international consultants required under the Project\nwill be financed from the proposed grants from JSF and the Government of Norway. Under\nthe JSF-financed group formation and training of beneficiaries component, a total of about 132\nperson-months of consultant services from individual sources will be required in the following\nfields of specialization: institutional development (local), planning/training (local) and Project\nimplementation (local). The terms of reference for consultant services are described in\nAppendix 5. Under the Norway-assisted Institutional Support to NGO component, a total of\nabout 156 person-months of consultant services from suitably qualified firms comprising about\n18 person-months of international consultants and about 138 person-months of local\nconsultants will be required. The team of consultants will include the following experts: (i)\nNGO Development Specialist (foreign), (ii) NGO Management Specialist (local), (iii) Training\nSpecialist (local), (iv) 'Financial/Marketing Specialist (local), (v) Microcredit Specialist (foreign),\nand (vi) NGO Credit Specialist (local). The terms of reference for consultant services are\npresented in Appendix 5. The consultants will be engaged by the Bank in accordance with the\nBank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.", "24\n7.\t Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n82. Overall monitoring of the physical and financial progress of the Project in\nrelation to work plans and budgets for the group formation and training of beneficiaries\ncomponent will be the responsibility of WDD. Baseline information on beneficiaries will be\nobtained by WDD with the assistance of NGOs. A benchmark survey, monitoring and\nevaluation studies of the Project's impact on beneficiaries will be carried out by WDD with\nassistance from UNIFEM following the procedures already established under PCRW. The main\nindicators to be monitored by WDD are the number and size of SHGs formed, number of\nwomen beneficiaries trained and provided with credit, amount of loans disbursed and repaid,\nand impact of the Project on family income and employment. To supervise and provide\ntechnical support to its field staff, WDD will appoint five experienced field officers as program\nofticers based in Kathmandu. In addition, process documenters will be engaged by WDD to\nmonitor field level procedures closely to understand the detailed interaction between\ndevelopment agents and the women beneficiaries, and to identify issues and constraints that\nrequire management action immediately. WDD will be responsible for the verification and\nanalysis of the information collected by other institutions. NRB, as the Executing Agency for\nthe credit component, will supply the information needed for monitoring the credit component\nto PlC. The results of the Project BME will be included in the semiannual progress reports that\nwill be furnished by the Project Director to the Bank and other aid agencies (see para. 87)\n8.\t Disbursements, Accounts, Reports and Audit\n83. The Borrower will cause NAB and WDD to establish, within three months after\nthe effective date of the Loan-Agreement, imprest accounts to facilitate the timely disbursement\nof loan proceeds to finance, respectively, the credit and noncredit components of the Project.\nAdvances will be made annually on the basis of the anticipated demand for credit by\nparticipating banks and NGOs and for the noncredit component by WDD. The imprest\naccounts will be established, managed and liquidated in accordance with terms and conditions\nsatisfactory to the Bank and consistent with the Bank's Guidelines on Imprest Account.\n84. NRB will transfer the advance for the credit component to an account to be\nopened especially for the Project. The loans to the NGOs will be disbursed by NRB directly\nor through other banks. Repayments by NGOs will be deposited to NRB's Microcredit Project\nfor Women account directly or through other banks.\n85. To liquidate the advances provided by the Bank to NAB, the Project Director,\nin cooperation with NRB, will submit to the Bank every six months certification of liquidations\nof the advance supported by two Statements of Expenditures (SOE: (i) the first SOE will\nsummarize disbursements by NAB to the PBs and NGOs; and (ii) the second SOE will\nsummarize payments by PBs and NGOs to the sub-borrowers.\n86. WDD and NAB will continue to maintain separate accounts and financial\nstatements for the Project and to have these audited annually by the Auditor General of Nepal.\nThe audited accounts will be provided to the Bank within 12 months of the end of the fiscal\nyear to which they relate. The PBs and NGOs that are involved in the delivery of credit under\nthe Project will be required to submit their audited financial statements to NRB not later than\n12 months after the end of each related fiscal year, and their financial statements will be", "25\naudited annually by suitably qualified external auditors. In addition, to enable the Bank to\nmonitor their institutional and financial performance, the two PBs will be required to submit their\naudited financial statements not later than 12 months after the end of each related fiscal year.\n87. Besides SOEs, the Project Director will also furnish the Bank and other aid\nagencies (including UNIFEM and the Government of Norway) semiannual progress reports on\noverall Project implementation. Within three months of the closing of the loan, the Project\nDirector will submit a Project completion report that will review in particular the impact of the\nProject on beneficiaries and the utilization of loan proceeds.\nH.\t Executing Agencies\n88. WDD/MLD will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the group\nformation and training of women beneficiaries and NGO institutional support components of\nthe Project, while NRB will be the Executing and Implementing Agency for the credit\ncomponent, with the assistance of the PBs and concerned NGOs. The selected NGOs will also\nassist WDD in implementing the group formation and training of women beneficiaries.\n89. WDD has had considerable experience as an executing agency for a number\nof WID projects covering some 49 districts in five development regions. It has developed the\nPCRW model, which will be used, expanded and improved under the Project. During the\nimplementation of the WID projects, the following major constraints or problems were\nidentified: (i) limited implementation capacity of WDD; (ii) excessive responsibility of the WDO\nand other field staff; (iii) delay in the release of Government budget to WDD; and (iv) rigidity\nof the participating banks in channelling agricultural credit. During recent years, the\nGovernment has taken concrete measures to overcome the constraints. These measures are\ndescribed below.\n90. The Government has increased the number of staff of WDD to replace the\ncontractual staff with permanent staff or to fill up the approved vacant positions. Recently, for\nexample, 19 WDOs, 37 supervisory WDOs, 98 chief WWs, 74 WWs, and 22 accountants were\nrecruited by WDD to build up the implementation capacity of field staff. The existing WDD\nCentral Advisory Board (chaired by the Secretary of MLD) has been revitalized so that it can\nprovide effective policy guidance and coordination to the WID projects, and WDOs have been\nshifted from the field to district headquarters to enable them to coordinate program activities\nat the district level effectively, and to participate in the District Development Committee\nmeetings. In addition, seminars and workshops attended by staff from WDD, line agencies and\nPBs are organized annually by WDD as a means to improve planning, coordination and\ncommunications. This ensures that the line agencies will be involved right from the planning\nstage of the program; that clear implementation guidelines, strategies and standard norms are\ndeveloped by WDD; and that the banking procedures for extending microcredit to women\nbeneficiaries are clearly specified. To improve Project implementation, the Government has\nreleased WDD's budget in a timely manner, and WDOs have been given financial authority in\nthe management of project funds at the district level. Finally, the data base at the central,\ndistrict and village levels has been improved as a means to monitor and evaluate the program\nimplementation.", "26\n91. The Government realizes that the number of WDD staff cannot be continuously\nincreased to cope with the increasing demands of the WID program because of physical and\nfinancial constraints facing the Government. Therefore, under the Project, the implementation\ncapacity of WDD will be further improved through the following measures: (i) selected NGOs\nwill be used to complement the activities of WDD staff in the delivery of support services and\ncredit to Project beneficiaries; (ii) part of the TA grant from JSF will be earmarked to train WDD\nstaff at the central and district levels about their tasks and responsibilities under the Project so\nthat there is clear understanding about their roles and about the Project itself; (iii) field staff of\nWDD will be provided with motorcycles or bicycles to improve their mobility; and (iv) NRB and\nWDD will establish imprest accounts to facilitate the timely disbursement of loan proceeds to\nfinance, respectively, the credit and noncredit components of the .Project.\n92. As a central bank, NAB has had wide experience in monitoring and supervising\ncredit projects in Nepal. As an Executing Agency for the credit component, it has considerable\nexperience in the implementation of the priority sector credit scheme, the World Bank-assisted\nCottage and Small Industry Project and IFAD-assisted PCRW. In view of this experience and\nits technical competence in supervising and monitoring credit projects in Nepal, NRB is\nconsidered n appropriate agency for implementing the credit component of the Project.\n93. The PBs include RBB and NBL. These banks have been selected because they\nhave extensive networks of branches throughout Nepal and have had considerable experience\nin lending microcredit to the poor under PCRW and priority sector lending programs. Although\nthe banks have had weak performance in the past, their performance is expected to improve\nsignificantly in the coming years as a result of the corrective measures they are taking with the\nhelp of the Government and the World Bank (see para. 35 and Appendix 3). In addition, the\nfinancing agreements between NAB and the PBs will provide appropriate safeguards to ensure\nthat Project funds relent to them are monitored and effectively utilized.\nI.\t Technical Assistance\n94. TA for the Group Formation and Training of Women Beneficiaries will\naccompany the proposed loan. The main objective of the TA is to provide social preparation\nand skills training to women to equip them for undertaking income-generating activities and\nsmall enterprises and/or for gaining remunerative employment where possible. The Executing\nAgency for the TA will be WDD/MLD. The TA will be financed from the Japan Special Fund on\na grant basis in the amount of $0.9 million. Although it is unusual for JSF-financed TA to be\nused for TA components of the projects financed by Bank loans, the cooperation arrangements\nbetween Japan and the Bank recognize that this maybe appropriate in special cases. The\nProject design provides that skills training and beneficiary participation (to be provided under\nthe TA) should be integrated with the provision of credit under the proposed Loan. The TA will\ntherefore form part of the Project itself.", "27\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.\t Financial and Economic Analysis\nProject Benefits and Beneficiaries\n95. Although precise quantification of Project benefits and the number of\nbeneficiaries is not possible because of the multiple credit line nature of disbursement under\nthe Project, estimates based on a tentative allocation of Project resources indicate that about\n20,000 women will be benefited from the skills training component. After receiving training in\nvarious technical, financial and/or management skills, it is expected that about 10,500 of them\nwill get agricultural production credit; about 3,000, micro-enterprise credit; and about 300, small\nbusiness promotion credit. The other trained women beneficiaries are expected to rely on their\nown savings or to obtain credit from other sources.\n96. At full development, the Project will have a direct impact on (i) the production\nof foodgrains, vegetables and livestock products; and (ii) the development of cottage and agro-\nindustries. It will foster the entrepreneurial spirit among women and increase their self-reliance.\nThe new jobs created from the enterprises supported through credit under the Project are\nestimated at 13,800 person-years for self-employment, and 11,000 person-years for wage\nemployment, comprising 10,500 person-years in the agriculture sector, 12,300 person-years\nin the cottage industry sector, and 2,000 person-years in the small business sector (see\nAppendix 6). The job creation cost will range from $116 per job in the cottage industry sector\nto $250 per job created in the small business sector. In economic terms, the credit component\nof the Project will generate total net income of about $4.45 million for its entire economic life,\nof which agricultural production credit alone will generate a net income of about $2.11 million.\n97. Improvement of the financial, manageriai, technical and operational capacities\nof NGOs supported by the Project will contribute to their long-term viability and sustainability.\nThe Project will improve the ability of local NGOs to assist the Government in implementing\nWID programs in rural and urban areas. These NGOs will also form a nucleus for the\ndevelopment of a self-sustaining financial system that will benefit the target group through\nprovision of savings, credit and related financial services.\n98. The financial internal rates of return (FIRRs) for typical subprojects range from\n24 per cent to 61 per cent while their economic internal rates of return range from 13 per cent\nto 35 per cent (see Appendix 6). Net cash flows after debt service indicate that the subprojects\nare attractive from the borrowers' point of view. Among the subprojects, livestock production,\ncottage industries and small business activities show high FIRRs. However, some of the\nsubprojects in the cottage industries seem to be sensitive to sales declines, suggesting that\nmarketing arrangements for their products should be examined closely by the banks or NOOs\nbefore recommending the subprojects to women beneficiaries. Under the Project, the NGO\nSupport Unit will advise the NGOs and the banks on the selection of viable\nenterprises/activities, in addition, the type of skills training to be offered by the Project to\nbeneficiaries will take into account the availability of markets for finished products and\navailability of raw materials and other inputs.", "28\n2.\t Proiect Risks\n99. The principal risk for the Project is that NGOs in Nepal lack sufficient experience\nto deliver social and financial serces to the Project beneficiaries as anticipated. To minimize\nthis risk, the involvement of local NGOs and SHGs in the delivery and recovery of microcredit\nwill be developed gradually and systematically. For this purpose, there will be a detailed\nsurvey of NGOs and self-help groups in the Project area, followed by identification of NGOs\nthat meet strict eligibility criteria to act as credit agents under Model A or as financial\nintermediaries under Model B, and TA and training support to eligible NGOs during the first\nthree years of Project implementation. Wherever possible, the Project activities will be carried\nout in districts and villages where NGOs and SHGs are known to operate. After the\nstrengthening phase and a thorough Mid-Term Review of the Project, the Government and the\nBank will decide whether to use the NGOs as financial intermediaries. In the event that the\nGovernment and the Bank decide to proceed with the credit delivery and recovery system\nunder Model B, the more developed NGOs in Kathmandu would be used initially as financial\nintermediaries, while district or village-based NGOs would be brought in later. This phased\napproach will ensure that a sufficient number of competent NGOs and SHGs can be developed\nto deliver the social and financial services under the Project, and that the risks of their\ninvolvement as financial intermediaries will be minimized. However, in some villages where\nsuitable NGOs cannot be found, the WDOs and WWs under MLD, in combination with the\nparticipating banks, will continue to organize beneficiaries and deliver social and financial\nservices to women using the PCRW model. The two credit delivery mechanisms under the\nProject (i.e., Models A and B) will enable the Project beneficiaries to receive credit from either\nthe PBs or the NGOs.\n100. The second identified risk for the Project is that the participating banks will not\nbe able to deliver and recover microcredit efficiently due to their weak performance in the past\nleading to unsatisfactory loan disbursements and repayment rates. The Project will meet this\nrisk by (i) designating WWs or eligible NGOs to act as agents for the participating banks,\nassisting in loan applications, project supervision and repayment follow-up in addition to group\nformation and beneficiary training, (ii) providing a sufficient interest spread of at least 11 per\ncent to cover the high costs of intermediation and supervision of microcredit, provision for bad\ndebts and a small profit margin, (iii) involving NGOs as financial intermediaries to complement\nthe activities of the PBs if after three years of Project implementation, the NGOs are found to\nbe willing and experienced in fulfilling the financial services function, (iv) utilizing other banks\nin the delivery and recovery of microcredit to Project beneficiaries if this proves advantageous\nwith respect to increased disbursement and repayment rates, and (v) insuring the loans to\nbeneficiaries with the Credit Guarantee Corporation. The risks related to the participating\nbanks will be further reduced by (I) the efforts of the Government and the World Bank to\nimprove the performance of the participating banks, (ii) the small size of the credit component\n(about $3.5 million) in relation to their assets (about $540 million) and deposits (about $430\nmillion), and (iii) the excellent repayment records of women subborrowers in the past\n101. The third identified risk for the Project is that bureaucratic rigidity will inhibit\ninnovation, leading to delays and inefficiencies in Project implementation. As the Project is of\na pilot nature, trying to develop a new modality for delivery of financial services to the poor,\nit is necessary that sufficient flexibility be provided during implementation, by both the\nGovernment and the Bank, to overcome unforseen obstacles. As much flexibility as possible", "29\nhas been provided in the Project design. For example, NGOs are free to formulate their\nrelationship with the beneficiaries in a way that suits their individual circumstances. Financing\narrangements can be altered to facilitate the flow of funds without sacrificing control and\nsupervision standards. For this purpose, an annual review and a Mid-Term Review have been\nincluded in the Project to consider adjustments in Project design and implementation\narrangements.\n102. The fourth identified risk for the Project is the limited implementation capacity\nof WDD. The Project will meet this risk through the following measures: (i) Project activities\nwill initially be concentrated in three districts that have already had a full complement of well-\ntrained WDD staff, and then the activities will be gradually expanded to other districts if WDD\nis able to engage trained field workers; (ii) local NGOs will be engaged by the PlC to\ncomplement WDD staff in undertaking the Project activities; and (iii) part of the grant funds will\nbe utilized to engage consultants and supporting staff to assist WDD in Proj?ct implementation.\n103. To minimize the risks discussed above, the Project will be closely supervised\nby the Bank during its implementation. During the initial years, loan review missions will be\nundertaken more frequently than usual in order to monitor closely the progress of Project\nimplementation, to identify problems that the Project will encounter and to work out measures\nto solve the problems.\nB.\t Social Dimensions\n104. The Project has been designed to improve the socioeconomic status of low-\nincome, socially disadvantaged women in selected districts and towns in Nepal. Beneficiary\nparticipation has been incorporated in the design of the Project to ensure that its assistance\npackage is based on the needs oT beneficiaries, in addition to constraints and opportunities\nprevailing in the Project area (see para. 69)\n105. The approach of the Project is considered innovative, since it is intended to\nencourage Government agencies and NGOs to work together at the village and urban levels\nto develop, promote and implement community service and development programs\ncorresponding to established needs of the women beneficiaries, and to develop alternative\nmechanisms for delivery and recovery of microcredit involving NGOs. The success of this\nProject will have far-reaching consequences on the implementation of the WID program in the\ncountry, as it will greatly improve the coverage of the Government's poverty reduction program.\n106. Social preparation is considered a prerequisite to any human resource\ndevelopment and investment program targeting marginal beneficiaries, especially women. For\nthis reason, the Project will emphasize social preparation as part of the strategy to improve the\nsocioeconomic status of women (see para. 69). In addition, to ensure the effectiveness of the\nincome-generating programs to be carried out under the Project, credit will be made available\nto women beneficiaries only after they have been organized into stable SHGs and have\nreceived appropriate skills training.\n107. In addition to improving the socioeconomic status of women, institutional\ndevelopment of NGOs will be carried out as a separate but parallel activity under the Project.\nImprovement of the financial, managerial, technical and operational capabilities of NGOs", "10\nEconomic Communities (EEC), the Netherlands and German Technical Assistance Agency\n(GTZ) (see Appendix 1).\n38. In the past, Bank assistance for WID in Nepal focused on indirect support to\nwomen beneficiaries through agriculture sector projects and, to some extent, social\ninfrastructure projects in education and water supply. Recognizing that rural women lack access\nto extension services, improved technology and credit, attempts have been made to address\ndirectly the constraints facing women in developing their potential as agricultural producers. One\nof the earliest Bank-assisted WID programs was designed as part of the Seti Zone Integrated\nRural Development Project,1' under which a WTC was constructed in Dipayal, in the Far\nWestern Region. Under SFDP Ill, about $3.3 million was allocated for the exclusive use of\nwomen for income-generating activities, while under the Upper Sagarmatha Agricultural\nDevelopment Project, about $0.5 million was allocated for promoting community development\ntargetted to women beneficiaries. These projects are still under implementation.\nD.\t Lessons Learned\n39. In the preparation of the proposed Project, the Mission has incorporated lessons\nlearned from the completed PCRW (Phase I) and Second Small Farmers Development Project\n(SFDP II) financed by other agencies (mainly UNICEF, UNFPA and IFAD). An impact evaluation\nstudy of PCRW (Phase I) was carried out in 1989, while the PCR of SFDP ll was carried out\nby the Bank in 1992. The reports bring out the difficulty of implementing microcredit projects\ntargetting poor women, although the repayment rate was high (more than 90 per cent) and there\nwas a close linkage between income generating activities and social services/community\ndevelopment activities. Because of the rigidity of the participating banks and the weak\nimplementation of the executing agency, the coverage of the projects in the districts was small.\nThe lessons learned from these projects are: (I) the number of project components should be\nsmall and manageable; (ii) adequate numbers of field staff should be appointed and trained to\nsupervise project activities; (iii) the WDOs and other field staff should not be overburdened with\nimplementation responsibilities; (iv) field staff should be closely supervised by staff from the\nheadquarters; and (v) savings mobilization should be made an integral part of the credit\ncomponent to ensure that the beneficiaries will be able to repay their loans and achieve healthy,\nself-reliant enterprises.\n40. The number of components under the proposed Project has been limited to three\nso that the problem of coordination among the implementing agencies is minimized. The\ndistricts included in the Project area have been carefully chosen to ensure that there is already\nan adequate number of trained field staff (both WDOs and WWs) deployed in them. The field\nstaff will be provided with motorcycles or bicycles to improve their mobility. To reduce the\nworkload of field staff of WDD/MLD, the Government has agreed to involve selected NGOs in\nLoan No. 748-NEP(SF), approved in October 1985.\nLoan No. 1114-NEP(SF), approved in October 1991.\nCenter for Economic Development and Administration, Production Credit for Rural\nWomen - An Impact Evaluation Study. Kathmandu, Nepal, 1989.\nProject Completion Report of the Second Small Farmer Development Project (Loan No.\n166-NE), July 1992.", "11\nProject implementation. The Government has also agreed to appoint additional experienced\nfield officers as program officers to be based in Kathmandu; the program officers will supervise\nand provide technical support to field staff of WDD through regular and more frequent visits to\nthe Project areas. The credit provision under the proposed Project will be linked to a savings\nmobilization program among the women beneficiaries.\nE.\t The Bank's Sectoral Strategy\n41. The principal strategic objective for Bank operations in Nepal is poverty reduction.\nThis is consistent with the Government's own development strategy enunciated in the Eighth\nPlan. Income distribution in Nepal is fairly egalitarian. A major policy implication is that there\nis little scope for poverty reduction through income and asset redistribution. Therefore, the\nBank's operational strategy in Nepal in the near-to-medium term will focus on poverty reduction\nthrough broad-based, labor-absorbing economic growth.!' Since agriculture is the backbone\nof the economy, accounting for over 55 per cent of GDP and 90 per cent of employment, this\nsector will need to receive substantial attention.\n42. To enable the poor to take advantage of the employment and income\nopportunities deriving from growth, targeted efforts will be made to enhance the productivity of\nthe poor and raise their incomes. Within these broad concerns, it is recognized that Nepalese\nwomen are among the poorest and most disadvantaged. The Bank, in keeping with the\nGovernment's poverty reduction strategies, will therefore continue to incorporate gender\nconsiderations in all relevant areas of its operations in Nepal.\nF.\t Policy Dialogue\n43. Policy dialogue duringprocessing of the proposed Project focused on the specific\nroles of WDD/MLD in the WID program, and the increased and more varied involvement of\nNGOs in W1D.\n44. Since its inception in 1982, PCRW has achieved significant progress in reducing\npoverty and improving the quality of life of the low-income and socially disadvantaged rural\nwomen in 35 districts. However, the project has been confined to only a few villages in each\nof the districts, mainly because of the low number and heavy workload of WDD field staff. To\nintensity the coverage of the WID program and to reach more beneficiaries, the Government and\nthe Mission agreed that the future roles of WDD will be confined to coordination, supervision\nand monitoring, while the implementation of Project activities will be gradually delegated to\ncompetent NGOs or subcontracted to other Government agencies or specialized training\ninstitutions or projects, although the prime responsibility for Project implementation will remain\nwith WDD.\n45. As part of the Government's policy to involve NGOs in national development, the\nGovernment and the Mission discussed the need to develop alternative mechanisms for delivery\nand recovery of microcredit involving NGOs. In this context, the Government has agreed to\nprovide a more favorable environment for the development of NGOs in the country through the\nBank's Operational Strategy in Nepal, January 1993.", "12\nreorientation of the role of SSNCC (now called SWC) and the adoption of policies and legislation\nfor the promotion of the participation of NGOs in financial services including savings\nmobilization. In addition, institutional support to NGOs has been included in the scope of the\nProject to strengthen the financial, managerial, technical and implementation capacities of NGOs\nso that they will be able to assist the Government in implementing WID programs and other\npoverty reduction programs.\n46. During the past 10 years, PCRW has been implemented by WDD mainly in the\nrural areas, since most of the poor live in those areas. However, considering the high literacy\nrate of women and the existence of pockets of poverty in the urban areas, and given the\nimportance of urban areas as centers of cottage industry and business development, the\nGovernment agreed to expand PCRW to selected urban areas under the proposed Project.\nIV. THE PROJECT\nA.\t Outline\n47. The proposed Project is designed to improve the socioeconomic status of women\nand promote their greater participation and integration in national development through\nconsolidating and expanding related service and development systems. The Project area\ncovers 12 districts and five towns that have a large number of women beneficiaries. Project\nassistance will focus on appropriate skills training and delivery of microcredit to women\nbeneficiaries through a new credit infrastructure involving both commercial banks and efficiently\nmanaged NGOs. The Project will complement ongoing efforts to reduce poverty in both rural\nand urban areas, will create employment opportunities for women in the small-scale enterprise\nsector, and is expected to provide new and replicable models for doing this. The target\nbeneficiaries of the Project will be mostly rural women who live below the poverty lines but will\nalso include a limited number of poor urban women and employees in the commercial sector.\nThe Project is in line with the Bank's sectoral objectives and strategies designed to reduce\npoverty through the creation of self-employment and wage-employment, the enhancement of\nthe role of women in development, and the strengthening and use of NGOs in Project\nimplementation.\nB.\t Rationale\n48. Among the poor, Nepalese women constitute the most disadvantaged sector in\nthe society, yet they provide over one half of the labor force in the agriculture sector. Past\nexperience indicates that promotion of women's income-earning abilities has had a major impact\non their participation in decision making regarding various household and agricultural matters.\nIn addition, since women are also the primary caretakers of households, their increased skills\nand knowledge will be transferred effectively to other family members. Therefore, a project with\nThe poverty line is defined by the National Planning Commission as the households who\nearn annual per capita income below NRs 2,500 in 1992 prices.\nThe Bank's Operational Manual No. 22 and 24, December 1986; and the Bank's Medium-\nTerm Strategic Framework (1993-1996), February 1993.", "13\nits focus on women in the development process is especially important in relation to poverty\nreduction and is essential for achieving overall viability of most development programs.\n49. To promote their income-earning abilities, it is essential that women be provided\nwith resources in the form of credit and services in the form of awareness and skills training.\nDuring the last ten years, a number of externally financed projects have been implemented by\nthe Government to address specific needs and constraints facing women, and to strengthen the\npublic sector institutions responsible for meeting their service and development needs.\nAlthough notable progress has been achieved by such projects in the introduction of essential\ncommunity development and income-generating activities for rural women, a significant number\nof women have remained outside the benefit stream. The major constraints affecting the WID\nprogram are the physical and financial limitations of the Government institutions in-charge of\nWID programs and the existing ineffective modalities for delivery of credit to the poor involving\nthe commercial banks. It is therefore necessary and appropriate to try new ways of reaching\nthe women.\n50. During the past few years, there has been a slow but significant build-up of NGO\nactivities in Nepal at the village and district levels. Many NGOs have shown willingness to orient\ntheir objectives and programs to serve women provided they are given financial and institutional\nsupport. Experience elsewhere in Asia and to a limited extent in Nepal itself has indicated that\nlocal NGOs can gradually develop the potenilal to complement Government efforts to promote\ncommunity development programs and to expand savings and credit services to the public.\nThe Government has indicated its willingness to encourage private sector community\ndevelopment and credit support services by involving NGOs, and to develop a favorable climate\nfor NGO development.\n51. In view of the above considerations, the Project has been designed to serve\ninitially as a pilot program to develop alternative mechanisms for delivery and recovery of\nmicrocredit involving NGOs, and to ensure that proven strategies are subsequently introduced\non a regional and national scale. The districts and towns included in the Project area have been\nselected to ensure that there are a large number of poor women and that the NGOs, commercial\nbanks and WDD staff are available to provide credit and other services under the Project.\nInstitutional support will be provided to NGOs so that they will be able to deliver credit and other\nservices to women beneficiaries. In designing the Project, the Mission carried out extensive\nconsultations with the Government, aid agencies, a number of potential participating NGOs and\nintended beneficiarIes)-'\nC.\t Objectives\n52. The overall goal of the Project will be to assist the Government in the\nimprovement and enhancement of the socioeconomic status of women and promote their\ngreater participation and integration in national development, thereby contributing towards\nDuring and after the loan fact-finding and loan appraisal stages, extensive consultation\nmeetings with the Government, aid agencies and NGOs combined with field trips and\ndiscussions with potential beneficiaries were undertaken to enable the Mission to design\na project that will be workable under the conditions prevailing in the Project area.", "14\npoverty reduction in Nepal. In order to contribute to the sectoral goal, the objective of the\nProject will be to improve the income and employment of poor women in selected rural and\nurban areas.\n53. The Project covers 12 districts and five towns' in Nepal (see Map). The\ndistricts and towns have been selected on the basis of the following criteria: (i) a large number\nof women beneficiaries; (ii) the deployment of one WDO and at least five WWs in each of the\nProject districts; (iii) the presence of NGOs and the participating banks, which can be linked with\nthe delivery of credit and other services under the Project; (iv) existing or planned activities of\nother aid agencies, particularly USAID, UNICEF, UNFPA, UNDP/lnternational Labor Organization\n(lLO) [Training for Rural Gainful Activities (TRUGA)], and GTZ [Small Business Promotion Project\n(SBPP)] which will complement and enhance Project benefits (see paras. 62-65); and (v) relative\naccessibility of the areas, which will facilitate Project implementation, monitoring and evaluation.\nThe selection of the districts and towns has also taken into account the ongoing activities of\nSFDP Ill to maximize complementarity while avoiding duplication.\nD.\t Scope\n54.\t To achieve the objective, the scope of the Project will include the following\ncomponents:\n(I) group formation and training of women beneficiaries including\nrehabilitation and improvement of existing training facilities to support\nboth staff and beneficiary training activities under the Project;\n(ii) institutional support to selected NGOs to enable them to expand the\ndelivery of community development and savings mobilization services to\nProject beneficiaries; and\n(iii) provision of credit to women beneficiaries who have been provided with\nskills training under the Project or from other programs for viable income-\ngenerating activities.\nProiect Components\n(a)\t Group Formation and Training of Women Beneficiaries\n55. The Project will provide support to WDD/MLD for carrying out social preparation\nand training of women beneficiaries. Women beneficiaries in the Project area will be mobilized\nand organized into stable self-help groups that will be used as focal points for access to public\nand private sector services. This will be followed by training to prepare them to undertake viable\nincome-generating activities. Women beneficiaries who have been organized into self-help\ngroups will be given appropriate skills training in crop production, livestock production, cottage\nDang, Pyuthan, Salyan, Kaski, Parbat, Baglung, Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, Chitwan, Dhankuta,\nSaptari and Siraha.\nKathmandu, PokharaJDumre, Nepalganj, Bhaktapur and Dhankuta.", "15\nindustry or small business. Consultants will be required to assist WDD in implementing,\nsupervising and coordinating the training activities; in carrying out inventories of training facilities\nand courses offered by the Government, internationai and national NGOs, and multilateral and\nbilateral agencies; and in preparing appropriate training manuals for specific courses.\n56. To support staff and beneficiary training efforts, the Project will provide funds to\nrehabilitate the existing MLD's Women Training Centers located in the Project area (e.g.,\nKathmandu, Pokhara, and Dhankuta) and construct additional classrooms and hostel services\nwhere appropriate, install improved water supply systems, and procure suitable training\nequipment and furniture. In addition, the Project will also improve and refurbish the Training\nMaterials Production Center (TMPC) in Kathmandu. The improvements to the TMPC will include\nthe rehabilitation of the existing physical facilities and procurement of appropriate printing\nequipment. The TMPC will be used to publish all training materials required by the Project.\n(b)\t Institutional Support to NGOs\n57. The Project will provide support to (i) carry out detailed surveys of NGOs in the\nProject area; (ii) prepare needs analyses of viable self-help groups (SHGs) and NGOs that are\ninterested in working for the Project; and (iii) strengthen the self-management and accounting,\nplanning and implementation capacities of selected NGOs. Subsequently, the selected NGOs\nwill be assisted in introducing credit-related services initially as agents of participating\ncommercial banks, and later as direct financial intermediaries.\n58. The selected NGOs will be provided with support for staff training, minimal\nincremental office furniture and equipment needs, and funds to cover part of their operating and\nmaintenance costs. NGOs, that have been sufficiently strengthened will subsequently be\nengaged to carry out in-field servicesncIuding group formation, training of beneficiaries, savings\nmobilization, and group activity planning and operation. These NGOs will receive further staff\ntraining and supervisory support in conjunction with participating commercial bank field staff to\nenable them to act as credit agents, and later as financial intermediaries.\n59. Exchange programs between key NGQ staff in Nepal and those in other\ndeveloping countries where grassroot development activities and financial service programs are\nsuccessfully operating will be organized under the Project to assist the NGOs in Nepal to adopt\nsuccessful concepts and develop appropriate expertise. The participants in the exchange\nprograms will also include officials from WDD, the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) and the\nparticipating banks.\n(c)\t Provision of Credit to Women\n60.\t The Project will make available credit for on-farm and non-farm income-generating\nactivities. Such activities will include crop, livestock and vegetable production, where women\n- are demonstrably the primary decision makers and the principal beneficiaries of the income\ngenerated, and any eligible enterprise in the agroprocessing, manufacturing, trade, transport\nand service sectors in areas not presently serviced by existing credit schemes. Credit will be\nprovided for fixed investment and/or working capital purposes to women beneficiaries, as\nindividual or group loans secured by joint liability of the members of the group, since most\nwomen in Nepal have no control over the. assets of the family that can be used as collateral.", "16\n61. The Project will make available credit to women beneficiaries who have been\norganized into stable SHGs and have received appropriate skills training under this or similar\nprojects. Credit will be supplied for the following purposes:\n(i) Agricultural Production Credit. A medium-term loan of up to NRs 30,000\nwould be made to sub-borrowers who have completed the requisite\ntraining in foodgrain, livestock or vegetable production, with a repayment\nperiod of up to seven years on the security of group savings linked to\ngroup guarantees;\n(ii) Micro-enterprise Credit. Women beneficiaries who have been trained in\nvarious skills using TRUGA facilities and methodologies (see para. 65) will\nbecome eligible for subloans for income generation subprojects of their\nchoice, related to their skills and resources. Based on the credit\nrequirement of the micro-enterprises, the women will be able to apply for\na medium-term loan of up to NRs 40,000 with a repayment period of up\nto seven years on the security of group savings and/or group guarantees;\nand\n(iii) Small Business Credit in Urban Areas. Following the successful\ncompletion of their training under the SBPP (see para. 65), women\nbeneficiaries will become eligible to borrow for subprojects of their choice,\nrelated to their skills and resources. Subloans under this component\nwould be NRs 50,000-250,000 per sub-borrower, repayable over a period\nof up to seven years on the secunty of individual savings and group\nguarantees r other adequate collateral. Applications for enterprise\nsubloans will require full feasibility analysis.\n2.\t Complementary Projects and Programs\n62. The scope of the Project complements the related activities assisted by other aid\nagencies. The United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) has agreed to provide\na TA for Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation (BME) to WDD. The scope of the TA will include (i)\na review of the various BME systems currently set up under WDD; (ii) integration of the systems\ninto a unified management information system, which will effectively monitor changes in\nwomen's well-being brought about by the Project and other projects implemented by WDD; (iii)\na benchmark survey in Project districts to collect socioeconomic information on beneficiaries;\nand (iv) processing of documentation, monitoring, evaluation and impact assessment of the\nProject on a regular basis. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $200,000 which UNIFEM has\nagreed to finance on a grant basis. The TA will be processed by UNIFEM on a parallel\nbasis. In addition, UNIFEM has also indicated its agreement to finance a TA for Mainstreaming\nGender Considerations into National Development, which will examine the structural obstacles\nto women's full participation in national development and recommend to the Government\nappropriate corrective measures in policy, institutional responsibilities and the legal framework.\nThe total cost of the second TA is estimated at $100,000, which will be financed by UNIFEM on\na grant basis. This TA will also be processed by UNIFEM on a parallel basis. The two lAs will\nsupport the overall objectives of the Project..", "17\n63. The USAID-assisted Rapti Development Project is operating in five districts in the\nMid-Western Development Region during its second phase (1987-1995). Five major programs\nare being implemented: agriculture, natural resources restoration and protection, employment\nand skills development, infrastructure development and institutional development. Three of the\nfive districts (viz., Dang, Salyan, Pyuthan) have been included under the Project. Selection of\nthese districts has been carried out in close consultation with USAID-Nepal with a view to\nmaximizing benefits accrued as a result of complementarity between the training and credit\nactivities under the Project and the social, community and skills activities supported by USAID.\n64. Under the ongoing PCRW, UNICEF and UNFPA have been providing support to\nthe Government's adult education, family planning, maternal and child health, and community\ndevelopment programs in 24 districts. For 1992-1 997, UNICEF and UNFPA have approved the\nexpansion of their programs to another 20 districts including nine districts covered by the\nproposed Project. The Project area has been selected to ensure that the training and credit\nactivities under the Project will complement the social services and community development\nactivities to be supported by UNICEF and UNFPA.\n65. The ongoing TRUGA financed by UNDP is a vocational training method\ndeveloped by ILO to promote non-agricultural employment and income-generating activities for\nthe rural poor. The third phase of TRUGA (1993-1998) covers all the districts in Nepal. The\nongoing SBPP supported by GTZ has also provided training of entrepreneurs in seven urban\nareas since 1983. The facilities and methodologies developed by these two projects will be\nutilized in the training of women beneficiaries under the proposed Project. The Project will\nextend its credit assistance to trainees of these two projects.\nE.\t Cost Estimates\n66. The total Project cost, including physical contingencies, price escalation and\nservice charge on the Bank loan during construction, is estimated at $9.6 million, consisting of\n$3.9 million in foreign exchange and $5.7 million equivalent in local currency. A summary of\nthe Project cost is presented in Table 1 (see Appendix 2). The cost estimates are based on\ncurrent 1993 prices.\nThe third phase of TRUGA has been renamed by the Government as Training for Rural\nEmployment Project (TREP).", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n18\nTable 1: Project Cost Summary\n($'OOO)\nComponent\t FX\t LC\t Total\n1.

The Government has requested a loan in Special Drawing Rights from the Bank's\nSpecial Funds resources in an amount equivalent to $5.0 million to finance the equivalent of\n$3.0 million in foreign exchange costs and the equivalent of $2.0 million in local currency costs.\nThe Bank loan would be made to the Kingdom of Nepal on the standard terms and conditions\napplicable to loans made by the Bank from its Special Funds resources. The loan will finance\n52 per cent of the total Project cost, mainly to cover the costs of credit and the rehabilitation of\nWTCs and TMPC. However, in the event that the Government is able to obtain grant funding\nfor the rehabilitation of WTCs and TMPC, the loan amount allocated to this component\n(approximately $1.0 million) would be reallocated or cancelled.\n68. An amount equivalent to $900,000 will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis\nfrom the Japan Special Fund to meet the costs of group formation and training. The\nGovernment of Norway has approved a grant in an amount equivalent to $2 million to finance\nthe cost of the NGO institutional support component of the Project. The rest of the Project cost\n(amounting to $1.7 million equivalent) will be met by the Government ($0.8 million), the\nparticipating banks and NGOs ($0.45 million) and the beneficiaries ($0.45 million). The\nGovernment's contribution of $0.8 million will include in-kind contributions of approximately $0.5\nmillion, mainly in the form of provision of Project staff and training facilities.

These are WDD under MLD,\nwhich will be the Executing Agency for the components covering group formation and training\nof women beneficiaries and institutional support to NGOs, and NRB (the Central Bank of Nepal)\nwhich will be the Executing Agency for the credit component. WDD will be responsible for day-\nto-day management and implementation of the Project including responsibility for reporting and\nBME (see details in Appendix 3). Following the PCRW model, which has been developed by\nWDD, women beneficiaries will be identified through household surveys conducted in selected\nvillages in the Project area which will be carried out by the field staff of WOD comprising WDOs\nand WWs. The women will then be mobilized and organized by WDD staff into stable SHGs,\nwhich will be used as focal points for access to public and private sector services. The groups\nwill undergo a series of training courses to promote awareness and achievable development\naims, leadership development, group dynamics and potential socioeconomic development,\nwhich will prepare the women beneficiaries to undertake viable income generating activities.\nThis social preparation, based on the PCRW model, will be given by WDD field staff or other\ntrainors who have been trained under PCRW and under the Project. eneficiary needs\nassessment will be made by WDD field staff through a participatory process so that feedback\nfrom beneficiaries will be fully reflected in the design of a package of assistance, which may\ncomprise social services (e.g., adult literary classes, family planning and maternal and child\nhealth care) and skills and management training for income generation. Following the social\npreparation work, women beneficiaries will be given appropriate skills training based on a\nthorough assessment of their needs, availability of raw materials and other inputs, and markets\nfor the products or services. Training courses for beneficiaries will be undertaken either in the\ntraining centers or in rented buildings at the village level in the Project area.\n70. Skills training to be provided to women beneficiaries under the Project will be\nsubcontracted by WDD to specialized training institutions or projects such as district training\ncenters operated by the Department of Agricultural Development, TRUGA project and SBPP.", "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t 8\u00b0N\n82\u00b0N\nNEPAL\n\u2014\t MICROCREDIT PROJECT FOR WOMEN\nFAR WESTERN ,\\\t 1\nREGION\t c\n1\t Humla\t ..\n30\u00b0E\t 7\n,'\t\nMID WESTERN\nDarctrula\t )\t //\t REGION\n/\t I\t\nBajhang ,.'\t /.\u2022\t 5,_\nMugs\t\nBaitadi\t ).\t\t '\t BaJra\t -y/)\n(\t - 1..-,\t-\t -\t\nII\t /\n-\t -.\nDadeidhura ..\t (\t Jumla\t /\n.-'\t Doti\t\nAchharn ) Kakot \\\t Dolpa\t )\nJ Mueang \u2022,\n(\t \t WESTERN\nKancharc,ur (\t Daitekh\t Jajarkot .\t I\t . ...-'\t REGION\n(\t 1\n'S'\t I\t Karlal\t .\t Rukurn\t Manang\t '\n\t / 'S\t -\n\u2022; S \\.\t /\t 'N\t Sutkhet\t 5,,\t Myagdu\t -.\t --\n\"I\t B d\t'\t /\t '-\"\\\t RolPa\t \u2014\t -\t L\t Kki\t Lamjurrg\t Gorinha\t CREENGTIROANL\n\tBae/\t \t (\t /\t .\t -\t -\t i\tbI :i\t f\t ----,.----,\t'I\t1\t /\t Rasuw-a-----\t N\t .

INTRODUCTION\n2. In January 1991 the Government of Nepal requested Bank financial assistance\nfor implementing a women in development (WID) project as part of its overall strategy to reduce\npoverty and promote sustainable development in the country. In March 1991 the Bank sent a\nReconnaissance Mission to assess the potential for a WID Project and to evaluate the\nimplementation capacities of the agencies in charge of development of women. The Mission\nwas assisted by two staff consultants, who continued the assessment until May 1991. Following\nthe completion of the study, the Bank fielded a loan Fact-Finding Mission in June 1991 and a\nFollow-Up Mission in September-November 1991, which had detailed discussions with the\nGovernment, the various aid agencies and a number of non-government organizations (NGOs)\nwith regard to the objectives, scope, financing plan and implementation arrangements of the\nproposed Project. After the priority of the Project was reconfirmed by the Government in early\n1992, and at the request of the Government, a Bank Appraisal Mission!' visited Nepal from 22\nMarch to 7 April 1992. After co-financing arrangements with the Norwegian Government had\nbeen firmed up by the Bank in October 1992, further consultations were carried out by the\nAppraisal Mission with the Government, the aid agencies, and NGOs during November 1992-\nFebruary 1993 to improve the Project design and implementation. This Report is based on the\nAppraisal Mission's review of the various reports on WID and NGOs in Nepal, its findings in the\nfield, and its discussions with Government officials and representatives of the external financing\nagencies and NGOs in Nepal.\nIll. BACKGROUND\nA.\t Women in Development\nRural Poverty\n3. In comparative terms, Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. It ranks\n117th in per capita gross national product (estimated at $180 in 1989 US dollars) among 124\ncountries listed in the 1991 World Development Report (World Bank). A similar picture emerges\nfrom a comparison of other economic and social indicators as well. Nepal's infant mortality rate,\nThe Mission consisted of D. Nangju (Senior Agronomist/Mission Chief), Y. Uehara\n(Project Specialist, WID), K Tsubota (Project Economist), P. Daltrop (Counsel), Z.\nRachman (Programs Officer), D. Baillie (Institutional Development Specialist/Staff\nConsultant) and F. Bennett (Microcredit Specialist/Staff Consultant). Representatives of\nthe Norwegian Government and the United Nations Development Fund for Women\n(UNIFEM), who are expected to co-finance the Project, also participated in the Mission.\nA. Kaukinen (Project Specialist, SDU) assisted the Follow-up Appraisal Mission on a part-\ntime basis.", "2\nfor example, is the highest in the South Asian region and higher than the average for all low-\nincome countries.\n4. Poverty is both extreme and widespread in Nepal. There is an absolute shortage\nof food at both the household and national levels. Average per capita availability of food is only\nabout 90 per cent of the minimum caloric requirement, and is much lower for those below the\npoverty line. Malnutrition is therefore widespread among women and children. While health\nservices have improved significantly over the past two decades, most people still do not have\naccess to organized medical care. About 40 per cent of the population is in absolute poverty,\nof which 48 per cent are in the Terai1' and 52 per cent in the Hills. About 94 per cent of the\ncountry's poor live in rural areas. The poor are overwhelmingly subsistence farmers. They\ngenerate about half their incomes from their own agricultural production, almost none of which\nis marketed. They earn less than 30 per cent of their income from employment, mostly on-farm,\ngetting the remainder from miscellaneous subsistence activities.\n5. The combination of very low average income levels and fairly uniform distribution\nof income suggests that the basic cause of poverty in Nepal is excessive population\nconcentrated on an insufficient economic base, rather than an unequal distribution of available\nwealth. The high annual population growth of 2.7 per cent in 1971-1980, and 2.1 per cent in\n1981-1990 has eroded the limited gains that have been made in gross domestic product (GDP)\nand food production. Continued and widespread poverty is primarily the result of insufficient\ngrowth in the economy, which is agriculture-based. Rural poverty is the outcome of an\naggregate deficiency in productive resources, principally land. Net cultivated land represents\nonly 20 per cent of land area, with very limited scope for expansion. Off-farm employment\nopportunities are severely limited and, therefore, an increasingly large number of people have\nto be absorbed by the agriculture sector. As a result, the size of average landholding of rural\nhouseholds continues to decline.\n2.\t Socioeconomic Status of Women\n6. Women in Nepal comprise about 48 per cent of the total population, Of whom 35\nper cent are economically active (National Planning Commission, 1981  ).a1 Within the overall\neconomy, more than 95 per cent of economically active females are engaged in agricultural\nwork. Their life expectancy of 52 years is among the lowest in the world. Among the poor,\nwomen constitute the most disadvantaged persons in the society. Apart from sociocultural\nfactors that have traditionally hindered the improvement of women's socioeconomic status, three\nmajor constraints may be identified: (i) limited access to education, (ii) limited access to\nproductive resources, and (iii) scarcity of time to undertake remunerative work.\n7. Women's limited access to education has been a major obstacle adversely\ninfluencing their economic participation and upward mobility. The female literacy rate of 12 per\ncent in Nepal (based on 1981 census) is one of the lowest in Asia. Girls constitute only about\nThe Terai is an ecological zone located in the southern part of the country and is an\nextension of the Indo-Gangetic plain.\nConventional statistics often do not reflect women's actual contribution to the economy,\nparticularly in indirect and nonmonetized forms.", "3\n35 per cent of the total enrollment at the primary level (6-10 years), 29 per cent in lower\nsecondary (11-12 years) and 27 per cent at the upper secondary level (13-15 years))' The\nmajority of these pupils live in the urban areas. Their school drop-out rate is also very high,\npartly because of heavy involvement in domestic chores and routine farm work. Lack of basic\neducation remains one of the principal causes of women's inaccessibility to new skills.\n8. Women also lack access to productive resources. Since almost all property\nincluding houses, land, animals and equipment is inherited patrilineally, women cannot own\nproperty in their own names except daijo - property given to a woman by her natal household\nat marriage -- and pewa - anything given to a woman as personal property or anything bought\nfrom earning. Moreover, women's lack of assets also results in their limited access to\ninformation, modern technology and financial services, especially credit.\n9. Women in Nepal are also among the most disadvantaged. Generally, they work\nconsiderably harder and longer than men and yet have only marginal control over the meager\nfinancial resources of the family. They carry out almost the entire load of domestic work\nincluding fetching water and carrying fuelwood. In addition, they provide about half of\nagricultural labor requirements. Overall, according to some estimates, a woman's work burden\n(at home and outside) is about 44 per cent greater than that of a man (10.8 hours as against\n7.5 hours).'\n10. There is great variation in the practical application of these factors from one ethnic\ngroup to another. Nepalese people can be broadly categorized into Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-\nBurmen, but there are many other small ethnic groups in which the status and position of\nwomen vary considerably. Autonomy of women is highest among nondichotomous\ncommunities, where a value is placed on female entrepreneurship (craft production and sale,\nmarketing and trading, etc.). In such communities, women contribute as much as 68 per cent\nof the local and expanded market economy and \u2022participate in major decision making at the\nhousehold level. However, in dichotomous communities, female entrepreneurship and\nmarketing activity are considered degrading, with the result that women are confined to the\ndomestic sphere. Women's participation in the market economy remains closely correlated with\ntheir socioeconomic status.a'\n11. However, a recent field survey shows that women, especially those who earn\ncash income, have been actively participating in decision making regarding various household\nmatters. The survey also reveals that most women participating in various aid-assisted\nprograms make the major household decisions concerning purchase of basic family needs such\nas food, clothing, education of the children, and provision of fodder requirements.\n12. Despite the constraints affecting women's socioeconomic status, it has been well\nrecognized that the promotion of women's cash income-earning abilities will potentially have a\nmajor impact on family well-being. This is because (i) women undertake a very large share of\nMinistry of Education and Culture, 1989.\nCenter for Economic Development and Administration, Nepal, The Status of Women in\nNepal, 1981.\nTA No. 5248-REG: Role of Women in Rural Industries, Final Report, 1988.", "4\nhousehold agricultural production; (ii) they exercise considerable control and influence over\nwhat they perform and produce within the household economy; and (iii) as primary caretakers\nof households, women are major change agents in health, nutrition, sanitation and family\nplanning. Experience reveals that some of the greatest impacts among the poor can be\nachieved by placing more income in the hands of women. Thus, a focus on women in the\ndevelopment process is seen to be especially important in relation to poverty reduction and is\nconsidered to be crucial in achieving overall viability of most development programs.!'\n3.\t Constraints in the Delivety of Microcredit to the Poor\n13. To improve the socioeconomic status of women, they must be provided with\nresources (e.g., credit) and services (e.g., skills training). At present, institutional credit to both\nmen and women accounts for only about 20 per cent of total borrowing on average, the\nremainder coming from moneylenders, friends and relatives or other non-institutional sources.\nLess than 10 per cent of this institutional credit goes to the poor.\n14. The Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) Program, launched by the\nWomen Development Division under the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) in 1982, alms at\nimproving the quality of life of rural women with per capita income below the poverty line.\nPCRW started as a small-scale credit program for women to engage in agricultural production\nand micro-enterprises, with provision of ancillary community development and skills training\nservices; it has now been effectively linked with literacy improvement, community development,\nand maternal and child health care activities covering 35 districts. The program is presently\nfinanced by International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), United Nations Children's\nFund (UNICEF), Finnish International Development Assistance Agency (FINNIDA) and United\nNations Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA). Under the program, the credit is provided by\nthe Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) and the two Government-owned\ncommercial banks, the Nepal Bank Ltd. (NBL) and Rastriya Banijya Bank (RBB). PCRW is a\ngood model for improving the socioeconomic status of women, but loan disbursement under\nit has been slow, and the coverage of the program has been confined to a few villages in each\nof the program districts. To improve loan disbursements and to expand the coverage of the\nprogram in the districts, under the Eighth Five-Year Development Plan (1992/93 - 1997/98) the\nGovernment has decided to involve local NGOs in providing financial and support services.\n15. Mechanisms for delivery of microcredit to the poor in Nepal are currently\nconstrained by (i) high administrative and supervisory costs of servicing small loans in difficult\nterrain; (ii) poor recoveries; (iii) inadequate interest spreads to cover the high cost of delivery;\n(iv) the lack of qualified and motivated staff; (v) inappropriate modalities/systems: and (vi) time-\nconsuming formalities and procedures, and resulting high borrower transaction costs. In spite\nof Government incentives and regulations, commercial banks are still hesitant to participate in\nthe lending programs to priority sectors (e.g., agriculture). People below the poverty line,\nespecially women, are not well served by the \u00f4ommerciai banking system. The present\nmodalities for delivery of credit to the poor, including women, are not effective.\nWorld Bank, Nepal: Poverty and Income, 1991.", "5\n16. Experience in Bangladesh, Philippines and Sri Lanka indicates that the problems\nof providing credit to women can be effectively addressed through NGOs as financial\nintermediaries. The grassroots nature of local NGOs ensures close contact with beneficiaries,\nwhich reduces borrower transaction costs and improves recovery. Local NGOs are generally\nnoted for their low-cost operations because of their small overhead expenditure and nonprofit\norientation. Thus, it would be appropriate to focus on the development of alternative\nmechanisms for delivery of financial services involving NGOs.\n4.\t Constraints and Potential of NGOs\n17. Although national and international NGOs have been operating in Nepal since the\nearly 1 950s, they have recently, with Government encouragement, proliferated. The emergence\nof a democratic government in 1991 encouraged NGO activities at the grassroots as well as\nnational levels. During 1984-1992, the number of national NGOs operating in Nepal in a formal\ncapacity increased from 115 to 545. This number does not include around 200 NGOs that are\nnot registered with the Social Service National Coordination Council (SSNCC), now called the\nSocial Welfare Council (SWC). In terms of geographical distribution, about 63 per cent of NGOs\nare concentrated in the Central Development Region (about 40 per cent in Kathmandu alone),\n13 per cent in the Western Region, 8 per cent in the Eastern Region, 4 per cent in the Mid-\nWestern Region and 2 per cent in the Far Western Region.\n18. During the same period, the number of international NGOs (INGOs) in Nepal\nincreased from 5 to 70. INGOs have been operating assistance programs linked wherever\nfeasible to district and village NGOs and/or established self-help groups. Largely because of\nthe rigid controls previously placed on sociopolitical activities in rural areas, bilateral and\nmultilateral agencies and INGO liaison activities were mostly confined to the capital. This has\nled to the formation of a strong Kathrnandu-based group of about 50 nonprofit private research\nand development organizations (PRDO5)!' and professional NGOs (PNGO).' Most of them\noperate area-specific village and district services and development programs where new\nconcepts of integrated village and NGO cooperation are being developed. Specific target\ngroups chosen by INGOs and national NGOs vary in accordance with actual services offered.\n19. As most NGOs in Nepal have been in operation for a relatively short period, their\nsmall size and lack of efficient management and direction constitute their most critical\nconstraints. At the district level, geographical isolation severely limits local NGO access to\nKathmandu-based TA services and to INGOs and potential sources of financing.\n20. The main strength of local NGOs in Nepal is that about 20 per cent of the formally\nestablished NGOs have been in operation for the last 10 years doing work similar to that\nrequired under the Project; they have already demonstrated the potential to expand their\nactivities and services among the community as a whole provided they can be assisted in\nstrengthening their managerial and operational competence. In addition, many financial self-\nPRDOs are organizations principally handling socioeconomic study programs.\nai\t\nPNGOs are organizations whose activities center almost entirely on the provision of\nbeneficiary training and support services.", "6\nhelp groups of local origin exist in various parts of Nepal..\" They play important roles as local\nfinancial intermediaries by mobilizing savings and providing credit. They may greatly improve\ntheir performance if they establish linkages with banks for mutually beneficial business relations\nand are provided with TA for making them viable NGOs3'\n21. Although it is recognized that some NGOs are being established partly in an effort\nto tap the ever-increasing potential sources of external, financing, an essential foundation of\ngenuine NGOs is already in existence, and many more NGOs are capable of providing rural and\nurban assistance for grassroots level development. Further institutional strengthening support\nprovided to NGOs at this stage will almost certainly act as a catalyst to accelerate their real\ninvolvement in community development.\n5.\t Sector Institutions\n22. The responsibility for WID in Nepal is at present divided between two line\nministries: the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare (MLSW) and MLD. Six other ministries\n(Health, Education and Culture, Agriculture, Forestry and Environment, Water Resources and\nIndustry) also retain small Women Liaison Units, each staffed by a single officer. Both MLSW\nand MLD retained separate Women Development Divisions (WDDs) while MLD also operates\nWomen Training Centers (WTCs) and a Training Materials Production Center (TMPC) within its\nDecentralization and Training Division.\n23. The major functions of WDD/MLSW are to oversee national level policies and\nprograms on WID, to collect and disseminate information and data on women, and to organize\nan interministerial coordination committee to discuss WID-related activities at the sectoral level.\nHowever, this arrangement is not functioning, as the present administrative system remains\nindividual ministry-related and consequently does not foster close liaison.\n24. The most important WID agency in Nepal is WDD/MLD, which was established\nin 1980 to initiate specialist programs for WID activities at the village and district levels. Its\nprincipal objectives and functions are (i) to coordinate with other line agencies and ministries\nat the district level to ensure that women's needs are adequately covered in all field service and\ndevelopment programs, and (ii) to formulate and implement effective policies and specialist\nprograms for WID within individual districts. In practice, the Division is principally concerned\nwith the implementation of community development activities and PCRW in 35 districts. There\nare, however, a number of other smaller programs operated by WDD in 14 other districts.\nThese include participation in (i) minor women's program components of Integrated Rural\nDevelopment Projects (IRDP5) in 11 districts; (ii) Enhancing the Agricultural Production Capacity\nof Rural Women Project supported by FAO in three districts; (iii) the development and\nNepal Rastra Bank, Survey of Self-Help Groups, 1987.\nThis approach has been successfully applied under the Small Farmers Development\nProgram being implemented by the Agricultural Development Bank (ADBN) over the past\n15 years with assistance first from UNDP/FAO, then FAD and more recently the Bank\n[Loan No. 1 037-NEP(SF) for $30 million for the Third Small Farmers Development\nProject]. A variant of this approach is being adopted successfully under the ongoing\nBank-financed Irrigation Sector Project [Loan No. 923-NEP(SF)].", "management of village drinking water systems financed by bilateral agencies and international\nNGOs; (iv) liaison with women groups on maternal and child health and family planning\nprograms, supported by UNICEF and UNFPA; and (v) a variety of other social service programs\ngeared to awareness creation, functional literacy and leadership training.\n25. WDD/MLD is expanding its network of services at the district and village levels.\nIn March 1992, 49 districts were serviced by a field staff made up of both permanent and\ncontract personnel. WDD Headquarters in Kathmandu maintains direct linkages with district staff\non operational and policy-related matters. Women Development Officers (WDOs) at the district\nlevel are responsible for (I) supervising women workers (WWs) and other WDD staff in the field;\n(ii) coordinating with line departments and participating banks to provide technical support\nservices, training and credit; (iii) assisting in design and implementation of community\ndevelopment districts; and (iv) reporting, monitoring and evaluating projects. The WDOs are\nsupported by \\NWs at the village level, who maintain direct contact with the beneficiaries and\nremain at the village site. In each of the 49 districts, there are 1 WDO and 4-6 WWs. In some\ndistricts, the number of WWs has been increased to 6-13. WWs usually hold a school leaving\ncertificate and are recruited from the same or a nearby district. They are responsible for health,\nfamily planning, child care programs, community development activities, income-generating\nactivities, group formation, liaison with the banks involved in PCRW and supervision of local\nbeneficiary training. In addition, they conduct household surveys to identify beneficiaries and\ntargets for new initiatives in the expansion of the WID program.\n26. The major constraints of WDD/MLD are: (i) most WDOs who are responsible for\ncoordination of project activities are not located in the District Headquarters; (ii) field staff have\nexcessive responsibility for project implementation and are not adequately supervised and\nguided by the staff at the central level; (iii) there are few staff at the village level, many of whom\nare hired on a temporary/contract basis; and (iv) most WDOs and WWs do not have transport.\nBecause of these constraints, WID activities in the districts have remained in need of substantial\nexpansion. However, during recent years, the Government has taken concrete measures to\novercome the constraints (see para. 90).\nB.\t Government Policies and Plans\n1.\t Poverty Reduction\n27. The focus of past development policies, plans, strategies and projects has been\non economic growth. \"Trickle-down\" effects were implicitly assumed to help reduce poverty\nonce growth gained some momentum but adequate growth did not materialize. Therefore,\ndirect efforts to help the poor have increasingly featured in the formulation of the Government's\ndevelopment strategy. Poverty reduction was specified as a goal in itself in the Seventh Five-\nYear Development Plan (1985/86 -1990/91) and is included as one of the major objectives of the\nEighth Plan. The Government has indicated that poverty reduction programs in the Eighth Plan\nwill be devised and executed in a manner that will benefit the actual poor directly and indirectly.\nPolicies to be adopted by the Government during the Eighth Plan period include (I) simple\nmechanisms to identify backward areas and poor families and to ensure conformity in the\nexecution of sectoral programs, (ii) self-targeted and targeted programs for the poor, (iii)\nincreased accessibility of the poor to productive resources, and (iv) employment creation in the\nnon-agriculture sectors.", "8\n28. During the Eighth Plan period sectoral programs designed to reduce poverty\ninclude programs in health, education, family planning, irrigation development, community\nforestry, labor-intensive construction works, small farmers' development and PCRW. Additional\ninstitutional arrangements will be introduced to encourage private sector individuals and NGOs\nto implement poverty reduction programs.\n2.\t Women in Development\n29. The Government first adopted explicit policies to incorporate the role of women\nin development under the Sixth Five-Year Development Plan (1980/81-1985/86). More specific\npolicy statements were also included in the Seventh Plan relating to the provision of additionaJ\nextension/training programs for women in the agriculture sector, the expansion of literacy\nprograms and the creation of additional employment opportunities in cottage industries.\n30. Under the Eighth Plan, the Government's WID policies have been outlined. These\ninclude (i) equal and meaningful participation of women in the development process; (ii) raising\nemployment opportunities for women in the economic and social sectors; (iii) expansion of\nwomen's access to credit, technical expertise, entrepreneurship training and market services;\n(iv) encouraging the appointment of women in the Government, semi-government and non-\ngovernment sectors; and (v) reform of laws and by-laws that hinder the development of women.\n31. In line with the Government's objectives to improve the socioeconomic conditions\nof the people in rural areas and to promote people's participation in rural development works,\nthe Government will launch special programs for women and will encourage NGOs to engage\nin programs that will benefit specific target groups. During 1992-1997, the WID program will be\nexpanded from 49 to 64 districts, about 7,900 women's credit groups will be formed to raise\nincomes through the provision of credit, about 40,000 families will benefit under the program,\nand the Local Development Training Program will be strengthened to provide training for both\nmen and women.\n3.\t Non-Governmental Organizations\n32. The Government has already published its Eighth Plan emphasizing an increased\nrole for the private sector and NGOs. The Government envisages an increased scope for the\nservices of NGOs in operating flexible, innovative and low-cost development services at the local\nlevel. This will motivate self-help participation and help create sustainable village support for\nmaintenance of essential services. Such assistance will enhance the principal aims of the Plan\nto enhance community participation, reduce poverty and promote balanced regional rural\ndevelopment.\n33. To encourage genuine and accelerated NGO participation in development, the\nGovernment formulated the Social Welfare Act, which was approved by Parliament in October\n1992. The Act seeks to simplify and better enforce NGO registration procedures, and to limit\nSWC powers to facilitating NGO/INGO/Government liaison, monitoring and evaluating\ndevelopment programs. However, since the Act does not include provision for regulating\nfinancial intermediation by NGOs, the Government has agreed to make the necessary legislative\nand/or regulatory changes to provide a more detailed framework to regulate the financial\nactivities of NGOs. At the rural level, the Government has recently enacted legislation to ensure", "9\nthat NGOs play a key role in planning and implementing village and area development activities\nassisted by the coordinated efforts of local administrative and elected officials.\n4.\t Credit Availability\n34. From the mid-i 980s Nepal has been implementing financial sector reforms aimed\nat increasing competition among financial institutions and financial instruments and at enlarging\nthe role of market forces. The scope of the reforms, supported by TA from the International\nMonetary Fund, the World Bank and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), was to\nremove controls on interest rates, improve financial instruments, strengthen financial institutions,\npromote indirect (non-administrative) instruments of monetary policy and improve surveillance\nof the banking system. The reforms have been successful in promoting financial intermediation\nand deepening the financial markets, as shown by the ratio of total liquidity of the banking\nsystem over GOP, which rose from 13 per cent in the mid-i 970s to 34 per cent at the end of the\n1980s.\n35. During the Eighth Plan period, growth in internal credit will be confined to an\nannual 14.3 per cent, and the flow of banking sector credit to the private sector will be increased\nby an annual 22.1 per cent. Since ADBN and the two Government-owned commercial banks\n(NBL and RBB) have continued to have performance problems, the three banks will make\nspecial efforts to recover outstanding loans as well as to manage bad debts as a means to\nimprove their collection rates. In addition, they have taken measures to (i) make necessary\nincreases in their capital; (ii) close loss-incurring branches; (iii) reduce excess staff; (iv) improve\ncredit processing, personnel development and management; and (v) stop provision of credit on\nGovernment guarantee. These measures are expected to improve their financial perfOrmance.\nThe Government is fully committed to improving the performance of the three banks in\nchannelling credit to the poor.\nC.\t External Assistance to the Sector\n36. Most foreign aid organizations working in Nepal have explicit policies to promote\nWID; many have been implementing programs and projects targeting women beneficiaries.\nThese programs and projects are executed by WDD/MLD. This sectoral focus of current\nexternal assistance coincides with the WID priorities of the Government's Seventh and Eighth.\nPlans.\n37. Within the agriculture sector, income generation and employment creation for\nwomen have been the major thrust of a number of aid agencies in the past decade. Generally,\nassistance is provided as a package of services encompassing (i) training for social preparation\nand increased awareness; (ii) community development services and subsequent skills training;\nand (iii) financial support in the form of credit in projects such as PCRW supported by UNICEF,\nUNFPA, FINNIDA, and IFAD; the Third Small Farmers Development Project (SFDP Ill) supported\nby the Bank1', and the IRDPs supported by the United States Agency for International\nDevelopment (USAID), the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the European\nLoan No. 1037-NEP(SF) for $30 million, approved in October 1990.", "\t\t\nRESTRICTED \u00e7\nRRP NEP 25088\n.d\nASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK\n-\t -\t -.\t -\t --\t -\t .-\t\n--\n-\t 4 -\t ___\n-\t 1;---'\n\t\n/\nI\t\n-?---\nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n;\nrr rLI\t 1\t\n- -\".\n-\t 1I I fl\n*\t -\t -i\t -\t -\t j\njBOARD OF\nON\n-.\t ;\nPROPOSED LOAN AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\t -\nTOThE\t 7\n,\n'--K1NGDOM OF NEPAL\ncjTL:\t ____\t _____\t __________\n-\t\n-\t June 1993\t -\t .--. .--\n-", "CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS\n(as of 15 May 1993)\t -\nCurrency Unit\t -\t :\t Nepalese Rupee (NRs)\nNRa 1.00\t -\t $0.020\t -\n$1.00\t -\t NRs 49.46\t :\n(i) The Nepalese rupee us pegged to the Indian rupee (Rs) at a rate f NRa 1 60 Rs tOO\nThe Nepalese rupee is fully convertible on the trade account\n(ii) Forthepurpose of calculations unthisReport,the rateof $1.00 = NRs42.70 has beect\nused which was the rate generally prevailing during appraisal\nABBREVIATiONS\t\nI -\nADBN\t - . ..

The Prolect The proposed Project is designed to improve the\nsocioeconomic status of women through provision\nof social preparation and skills training, institutional\nsupport to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)\nand provision of credit to women. The Project area\nwill cover 12 districts and five towns in Nepal.\n3. Classification The primary objective of the Project will be women\nin development, with poverty reduction and human\nresource development as secondary objectives.\n4. Rationale : Women in Nepal are among the poorest, yet they\nprovide over half of the labor force in the agriculture\nsector. Although, during the last ten years, a\nnumber of externally financed projects have been\nimplemented by the Government to address\nspecific needs and constraints facing women,\nsignificant numbers of women have remained\noutside the benefit stream. Given the enormity of\nthe physical and financial constraints facing the\nGovernment, it is unlikely that public sector services\nalone will ever be able to service the needs of\nsignificant proportions of society. It is therefore\nnecessary and appropriate to try new ways of\nreaching women by promoting genuine and\naccelerated NGO participation in development. The\nGovernment has indicated its intention to develop\na favorable climate for NGO development and to\nencourage private sector community development\nand credit support services by involving NGOs.\nThe Project is designed to serve initially as a pilot\nprogram to develop alternative mechanisms for\ndelivery and recovery of microcredit involving\nNGOs, and to ensure that proven strategies are\nsubsequently introduced on a regional and national\nscale. This innovative approach is expected to\nhave significant impacts on family income and\nemployment creation among a large number of\nwomen.\n5. Obiectives and Scope : The overall goal of the Project is to improve the\nsocioeconomic status of women in Nepal and\npromote their participation and integration in", "(iii)\nnational development, thereby contributing towards\npoverty reduction. In ord.er to contribute to this\nsectoral goal, the objective of the Project will be to\nimprove income and employment of poor women\nin selected rural and urban areas. The main\ncomponents of the Project are:\n(i) Group Formation and Training of Women\nBeneficiaries: (a) social preparation and\nskills training of women beneficiaries so as\nto equip them to undertake income-\ngenerating activities and small enterprises\nand/or to gain remunerative employment,\nand (b) rehabilitation and improvement of\nthe existing Women Training Centers and\nthe Training Materials Production Center to\nsupport staff and beneficiary training efforts.\n(ii) Institutional Support to NGOs, including\nsurveys of NGOs; support for staff training;\nstrengthening of management, accounting\nand reporting functions; and development of\nexpertise to enable NGOs to act as effective\nfinancial intermediaries.\n(iii) Provision of Credit to Women, who have\nreceived appropriate skills training for\nagricultural production, micro-enterprises\nand small business creation.\n\t\n6. Bank Financing (I) $5.0 million from the Bank's Special Funds\nresources to finance the costs of credit and\nrehabilitation of training facilities; the loan\ncarries a service charge of 1 per cent per\nannum and an amortization of 40 years\nincluding a grace period of 10 years;\n(ii)\t $0.9 million from the Japan Special Fund\n(JSF) to finance the costs of the group\nformation and training component on a\ngrant basis\n\t\n7 Other Source of Financing $2.0 million from the Government of Norway to\nfinance the costs of institutional support to NGOs\non a grant basis.\n\t\n8 Period of Utilization Until 30 June 2000", "\t\t\t\t\t\n(iv)\n9.\t Cost Estimates\n(in $'OOO)\nComponent\t FX\t LC\t Total\n1.

PBs and\nNGOs will onlend the proceeds of the loans,\ntogether with their own funds, to women\nbeneficiaries at a minimum of 17 per cent per\nannum, which is the prevailing commercial bank\nlending rate in Nepal.\n11. Executing Agencies : WOO under MLD will be the Executing Agency for\nthe group formation and training of women\nbeneficiaries and NGO institutional support\ncomponents of the Project, while the Nepal Rastra\nBank (Central Bank of Nepal or NRB) will be the\nExecuting Agency for the credit component.\n12. Implementation Arrangements: WDD will be responsible for day-to-day\nmanagement and implementation of the Project\nwith NRB implementing the credit component.\nSelected NGOs will assist WDD in implementing the\ngroup formation and training of women\nbeneficiaries. Beneficiaries will be given skills\ntraining in cooperation with Government line\ndepartments and other projects offering specific\nskills training. The Project will make available credit\nonly to beneficiaries who have received appropriate\nskills training. Under the Project, there will be two\nmechanisms for credit delivery and recovery. In the\nfirst mechanism (called Model A), NAB will relend\npart of Bank loan proceeds to the participating\nbanks (Rastriya Banijya Bank and Nepal Bank Ltd.),\nwhich will onlend directly to women beneficiaries.\nIn the second mechanism (called Model B), NRB\nwill relend a portion of the loan proceeds to NGOs\nfor onlending to women beneficiaries where NGOs\nare willing and are experienced in fulfilling the\nfinancial services function. During the first three\nyears of Project implementation, the Project will\nfocus on strengthening NGOs and, with respect to\ncredit, will use the PBs as financial intermediaries\n(Model A). After a comprehensive review of the\nProject at the end of the third year, the Government\nand the Bank will decide on whether to utilize\nModel B in addition to Model A. The strengthening\nof local NGOs will be carried out by the NGO\nSupport Unit within WDD, comprising domestic and\ninternational consultants. The Project activities will\nbe coordinated by the Project Implementation\nCommittee (PlC) at the central level, and by the", "(vi)\nWomen Development Officers of WDD at the district\nlevel. The PlC will be headed by a Project Director\nwho is the Joint Secretary of MLD in-charge of\nWDD.\n13. Procurement : Procurement of goods and services under the\ncredit component will be done according to normal\ncommercial procedures through direct purchase by\nthe sub-borrowers. Equipment and vehicles\nrequired by the Project will be procured mainly on\nthe basis of international shopping, and in some\ncases through direct purchase. The civil works\nrelated to the rehabilitation and improvement of the\ntraining centers will be carried out on the basis of\nlocal competitive bidding procedures acceptable to\nthe Bank. The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement\nwill be used in the procurement of civil works and\nequipment.\n14. Consultant Services : Two groups of consultants will be required by the\nProject: (I) 132 person-months of consultant\nservices from individual sources to assist WDD in\nthe implementation of group formation and training\nof women beneficiaries. The cost of these\nconsultant services will be financed from JSF on a\ngrant basis; (ii) 156 person-months of consultant\nservices from suitably qualified firms to assist WDD\nin the implementation of institutional support to\nNGO component. These consultant services will be\nfinanced by the Government of Norway on a grant\nbasis. All the consultants will be engaged in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use\nof Consultants.\n\t\nI1 Estimated Project\n\t\nCompletion Date 31 December 1999\n16. Proiect Benefits and\nBeneficiaries About 20,000 women will be benefited from the\nskills training component, of whom 10,500 will\nreceive agricultural production credit; 3,000, micro-\nenterprise credit; and about 300, small business\nformation credit. The other women beneficiaries\nare expected to rely on their own savings or to\nobtain credit from other sources. The Project will\nhave a direct impact on developing effective\nsystems to promote coordinated public/private\nsector services, which in turn will generate\nexpanded production of foodgrai ns, vegetables and", "(vii)\nlivestock products; and promote cottage and agro-\nindustries production, and self-reliance among\nwomen. The new jobs created under the Project\nare estimated at 24,800 person-years. FIRRs for\ntypical subprojects range from 24 to 61 per cent.\n17. Technical Assistance : Technical Assistance (TA) for Group Formation and\nTraining of Women Beneficiaries accompanies the\nproposed loan. This TA will be financed from JSF\non a grant basis in the amount of $0.9 million.
