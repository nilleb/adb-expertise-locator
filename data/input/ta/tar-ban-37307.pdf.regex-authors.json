Since  1984,  ADB  has  provided  five  loans  to  secondary  education  totaling  \n$287.1  million.1  Over  the  years,  the  focus  of  ADB  projects  has  shifted  toward  policy \ndevelopment and reforms and systemic improvement to support the Government\u2019s broader \neducation  reform  agenda.  Accordingly,  ADB  provided  technical  assistance  (TA)2  to  the \nGovernment to prepare a secondary education sector development plan (SESDP), analyzing \nmajor issues and identifying areas for reform and improvement in the subsector. The ongoing \nSecondary Education Sector Improvement Project (SESIP) was prepared based on the plan. \nSESIP  aims  to  improve  secondary  education  by  means  of  comprehensive  sector  reforms.  \nThe Government has requested, with ADB concurrence, including a follow-on loan, SESIP II \n(formerly Secondary Education II), in the Bangladesh Country Strategy and Program Update \n2005\u20132006.3 The project preparatory TA Fact-Finding Mission was conducted between 16 and \n28 October 2004 and reached understanding with the Government on the purpose, outputs, \nmethodology, key activities, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  Bangladesh\u2019s education system currently consists of 5 years of compulsory primary \neducation (grades 1\u20135) and 7 years of secondary education (grades 6\u201312), which is divided into \njunior  secondary  (grades  6\u20138),  secondary  (grades  9\u201310),  and  higher  secondary  education \n(grades 11\u201312). The Ministry of Education (MOE) is responsible for policy and planning for \nsecondary,  vocational,  technical,  and  higher  education.  The  Directorate  of  Secondary  and \nHigher Education (DSHE) of MOE is responsible for overseeing the administration of secondary \nschools, colleges, and postprimary madrasahs (religious schools). Given the enormous growth \nin the number of secondary institutions in recent years, the administrative and supervisory \nsystem, along with its capacity, requires refocusing and strengthening to ensure an adequate \nquality of education in secondary schools.  \n \n3.  Steady growth in education over the last three decades has resulted in a concomitant \nexpansion in the number of schools and teachers and in enrollments. Currently there are almost \n19,000 secondary schools registered by the Government with about 11 million students, of \nwhom some 53% in grades 6\u201310 and 54% in grades 11\u201312 are girls. The gross enrollment ratio \nin secondary education averages about 30%, marked by significant losses in higher grades,  \ni.e., 38% in junior secondary, 25% in secondary, and 19% in higher secondary education.  \nThe total number of teachers in the secondary schools is approximately 240,000, of whom \nabout 150,000 are untrained. The proportion of female teachers is approximately 17% in grades \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1984.

Current \nGovernment policy is that women teachers should eventually make up 30% of all teachers. \n \n4.  Notwithstanding the quantitative achievements, weaknesses in the secondary system \nare reflected in the declining quality of graduates and teachers and challenges persist. Some \n60% of teachers are still untrained, and most schools lack the standard conditions essential for \nthe normal instructional process. Standard cohort analysis over the entire secondary cycle \nreveals the extent of wastage in the secondary education system in terms of both failure and \ndropout rates. Dropout rates average 52% for secondary grades 6\u201310 (53% for girls) and 41% \nfor  higher  secondary  grades  11\u201312  (40%  for  girls).  Pass  rates  for  the  secondary  school \ncertificate declined from 55% in 1999 to 36% in 2003, but slightly improved to 48% in 2004. \nPass rates for the higher secondary certificate declined from 56% in 1999 to 27% in 2002, \nimproving to 38% in 2003 and 48% in 2004. As a whole, these failure rates together with the \ncompounding dropout rates represent a huge wastage of financial resources.  \n \n5.  Several  reasons  account  for  the  decline  in  the  quality  of  secondary  education.  \nOne reason is poor teaching. Poor and disadvantaged students are affected the most because \nthey rarely have other educational options and cannot afford the fees for additional tuition.  \nWhile girls' enrollment has improved significantly, their performance and retention in secondary \neducation are undermined by several factors, including the lack of female teachers. The ADB-\nfunded Teaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project (TQISEP) (footnote 1) \nwill support the Government in implementing teacher training reform nationwide. While the \nultimate aim is to improve the quality of learning in secondary schools by improving the quality \nof  teaching,  the  TQISEP  will  pursue  the  comprehensive  policy,  institutional,  and  systemic \ndevelopments  required  for  the  sustainable  development  of  teacher  training.  In  addition,  \nthe TQISEP will emphasize the training of female teachers and teachers from remote areas and \ndisadvantaged groups, including ethnic minorities. However, while the TQISEP will provide \nspecific support for improving teacher training, further support is necessary for reforms in other \nareas of secondary education. \n \n6.  About 98% of secondary schools are private and each private secondary school is \noverseen  by  its  own  school  management  committee.  However,  despite  the  massive \nGovernment financial subvention program that provides 90% of teacher salaries in the private \nsecondary schools, performance or accountability requirements are few. The indiscriminate \nestablishment of schools and colleges that fail to meet minimum standards contributes to the \ndeterioration of the quality of education. SESIP has helped the Government develop reform \nmeasures  to  improve  the  quality,  efficiency,  and  accountability  of  school  management \ncommittees as part of the Government\u2019s reform framework for secondary education. To help \nstrengthen management systems and capacity, SESIP has focused on (i) supporting policy and \nstrategic  planning,  (ii)  decentralizing  management,  (iii)  developing  performance-based \nmanagement systems as a basis for (iv) strengthening school management and supervision.  \nTo help build support systems for improved quality, SESIP has focused on (i) strengthening the \ncapacity  for  curriculum  development,  (ii)  privatizing  textbook  production,  (iii)  reforming  the \nexamination system, and (iv) improving teacher education. In addition, SESIP has helped to \nexpand equitable access to secondary education by (i) providing new secondary schools and \nclassrooms in underserved areas, (ii) establishing a school improvement fund for schools in \nunderserved areas, and (iii) providing stipends for girls.  \n \n7.  The Government\u2019s reform of secondary education involves strengthening a large number \nof institutions and developing policies on such important issues as the nature and scope of \ndecentralization. The reform process involves a large group of stakeholders and influences the \n ", "  3\nflow of all major inputs into the subsector. Therefore when SESIP was designed, a long-term \nview was necessary in terms of implementation and the achievement of policy and reform \nobjectives. SESIP was designed to be the first stage in the long-term secondary education \nreform process and framework. One of the main challenges was to predict the pace at which \nreforms would take place. Thus SESIP\u2019s design was based on a process approach with two \nmajor implementation phases, whereby pilot activities and lessons learned during phase 1 \nwould inform the continuation and expansion of reform activities in phase 2. Further support is \nnecessary to complete the expansion of the reform activities and, where necessary, undertake \nfurther pilots. \n \n8.  The  Government  and  a  large  group  of  development  partners  have  embarked  on \nimproving the quality of primary education on a large scale. An increased number of primary \nschool graduates in the future will create demand for further quantitative expansion of the \nsecondary education system. Additional investments are therefore needed to help build more \nschools and train more secondary school teachers by means of the improved teacher training \nsystem to be established with the assistance of the TQISEP. In addition, globalization has \nplaced additional demands on education world-wide and has implications for the development of \nsecondary education in Bangladesh, especially in terms of the relevance of the curriculum to \nmarket needs both in Bangladesh and globally. The use of information and communications \ntechnology in support of sector planning and management and the delivery of good quality \nsecondary education is equally important.  \n \n9.  By helping the Government to update the SESDP and prepare SESIP II, the TA will build \non  successful  earlier  projects,  support  the  achievement  of  the  Government\u2019s  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals, and help implement ADB\u2019s education strategy and Bangladesh Country \nStrategy and Program. By building on the lessons learned and reform outputs achieved under \nSESIP, the proposed SESIP II will assist the Government in expanding the coverage and \nincreasing the depth of reform and improving the relevance, efficiency, quality, and equity of \nsecondary education. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will help the Government (i) review and update the SESDP and its policy \nframework, prioritized strategies, and investment plan; and (ii) prepare SESIP II. Within the \nframework of subsector analysis, the TA will undertake a detailed feasibility study for SESIP II \ncovering grades 6\u201312, including madrasah schools. In consultation with stakeholders, the goal \nand  purpose  in  the  project  framework  of  the  current  SESIP  have  been  adopted  as  the \npreliminary goal and purpose for SESIP II, as indicated in Appendix 1. These will be further \nreviewed and modified as necessary under the TA in consultation with all stakeholders. The TA \nwill help the Government assess the need to continue the implementation of components of the \ncurrent SESIP under SESIP II and, where necessary, adjust the existing components and/or \ninclude new components. The latter may include, for example, human resource development \nand capacity building in planning and management in MOE and mobilization of resources for \nschools through increased community participation. Based on the feasibility study, the TA will \nprepare the design for SESIP II, including its rationale, justification, framework, objectives, \ntargets, detailed project components, costs, economic and financial analyses, benefits, and \nimpacts and assess its risks. The initial poverty and social analysis (Appendix 2) will be further \ndeveloped to provide a comprehensive analysis in support of the project design. The TA will \nidentify baseline data and monitoring indicators and prepare detailed implementation plans and \n ", "4  \nschedules, including for subprojects and procurement plans. The project design will draw on \nimportant  lessons  learned  during  the  course  of  SESIP  and  other  ADB-,  Government-,  \nand externally-assisted projects in the subsector, and will be carefully aligned with the scope \nand design of the TQISEP, to avoid any overlap. The Project is expected to finance further \npolicy reform pilots and expand current reform activities. The project design output will follow the \nformat of ADB Board documents, including the necessary appendices.  \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The subsector analysis will (i) review relevant data, documents, and strategies to identify \ngaps and needs for adjustments in the subsectors\u2019 policies, programs, and financing; (ii) review \nthe planning processes and procedures and the management structure in the subsector and \nassess institutional and organizational development needs; (iii) study the lessons learned from \nother projects in the subsector; and (iv) analyze issues related to the quality of secondary \neducation and the policy and strategy context required for sustainable reform of the subsector. \nThe  analysis  will  also  pay  attention  to  the  reform  requirements  for  secondary  education \nresulting from developments in the primary education subsector. \n \n12.  The TA will adopt a participatory methodology at the central and field levels through \nconsultative seminars, workshops, and focus group discussions with Government officers and \nother stakeholders, beneficiaries, civil society, and development partners, and will undertake \nsurveys  and  interviews  for  additional  data  collection  in  the  field  as  necessary.  \nGender-disaggregated data will be used as much as possible. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, of which $600,000 will be \nfinanced by ADB covering the entire foreign exchange cost of $429,750 and local currency \ncosts of $170,250 equivalent. The Government contribution will be in kind and equivalent to \n$150,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. ADB financing will include the costs of consulting services, production of \nreports, required equipment, seminars and workshops, studies and field surveys, automobile \nrentals,  and  some  administrative  and  support  services.  The  Government  contribution  will \ninclude the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation, utilities, support, translation, \nand  logistics.  The  Government  has  assured  the  availability  of  Government  funding.  \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  6  months  beginning  on  1  April  2005  and  \nwith an estimated completion date of 30 September 2005. DSHE will be the executing agency \nfor the TA. At TA inception, a steering committee will be established, chaired by the secretary of \nMOE, to ensure coordination with concerned departments and institutions and provide overall \nguidance to the TA. The steering committee will include representatives from the Ministry of \nFinance;  the  Planning  Commission;  and  the  Implementation,  Monitoring,  and  Evaluation \nDivision and the heads of key stakeholder organizations involved in the Project, including \nDSHE,  National  Curriculum  and  Textbook  Board,  Board  of  Intermediate  and  Secondary \nEducation,  National  Academy  of  Educational  Management,  and  Bangladesh  Bureau  of \nEducational Information and Statistics. The project director for the TA, to be nominated by \n ", "  5\nMOE, will be the secretary of the steering committee. A technical committee will also be set up \nand will be chaired by the director general of DSHE. Committee members will be drawn from \nMOE and the key project institutions. Committee\u2019s responsibilities will include assisting and \ncollaborating  with  the  TA  team  in  relation  to  all  TA  implementation  matters.  The  steering \ncommittee will meet every other month and the technical committee will meet monthly to ensure \nGovernment  ownership  of,  support  for,  and  commitment  to  implementing  the  TA  and  the \nensuing Project. An inception workshop at the start of the TA will clarify its purpose, will discuss \npertinent issues and the timetable, and will set close coordination and consultation with the \nstakeholders in motion.  \n15.  The TA will be implemented by a team of six international (17.5 person-months) and \nseven domestic consultants (25 person-months) to provide specialist services in the following \nareas: secondary education planning, management, and monitoring and evaluation; education \nfinance;  curriculum  and  materials  development;  student  assessment  and  examinations; \neducation management and information systems; information and communications technology; \ndecentralized management and administration; social development and gender; and facilities \ndevelopment  and  procurement.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 4. The quality and cost-based selection method will be used for recruitment. ADB will \nengage the consultants through a firm using the simplified technical proposal procedure in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and \nIts Borrowers and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. The consultants will procure equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nProcurement and this equipment will be turned over to DSHE on completion of the TA. \n16.  Within 1 month of TA commencement, the consultant team will present an inception \nreport at an inception workshop that details the proposed methodologies, work plans, and \nschedules to be used during the TA implementation. The consultants will consult stakeholders \nat various levels and work closely with the technical committee in collecting and analyzing data \nand identifying issues and approaches and will present a detailed subsector analysis and \nupdated  SESDP  to  the  steering  committee,  MOE,  and  ADB.  Based  on  this  output,  \nthe consultants will prepare a detailed feasibility study for the ensuing Project and a detailed \nproject  design.  Upon  submission  of  the  draft  final  report,  the  consultants  will  work  with \nstakeholders at various levels to obtain feedback. The consultants and counterpart staff will \norganize  national  workshops  to  discuss  the  issues  to  be  addressed  in  the  design  of  the \nproposed project. A tripartite review meeting will be convened to discuss the draft final report, \nand based on the feedback, the consultants will submit a final report by the end of the TA. \n \nIV.

No \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh \nRecognition of the systemic weakness in the sector prompted the Government to invest in education as one of the four \npillars  of  human  development  and  accelerated  economic  growth.  The  Government  is  committed  to  improving \nsecondary education through a set of comprehensive reforms. The Government has also committed, in addition to \nEducation for All I and II, to the Millennium Development Goals and the interim poverty reduction strategy paper \nprocess. Attaining the Millennium Development Goals requires, among other things, the achievement of universal \nprimary education, an adult literacy rate of 95%, and a secondary school enrollment rate of 95% by 2015, while the \ninterim poverty reduction strategy paper process entails the whole gamut of human development issues.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s secondary education reform involves strengthening a large number of institutions and developing \nimportant policies, such as the nature and scope of decentralization. The reform process involves a large group of \nstakeholders and influences the flow of all major inputs into the subsector. A long-term view is necessary in relation to \nthe implementation and achievement of policy and reform objectives. One of the main challenges has been to predict \nthe pace at which reforms will take place. Thus the Government is pursuing reforms through a process approach, \nwhereby pilot reform activities and lessons learned from them inform the continuation and expansion of reform \nactivities. For the reforms to succeed, adequate time must be allowed to learn the lessons of pilots and to obtain the \nviews and incorporate the plans of stakeholders at lower levels before a reform initiative is amalgamated into a \nnationwide initiative and expansion. To ensure the involvement and ownership of stakeholders, a bottom-up strategy \nfor reform formulation is necessary instead of a top-down process. \n \nThe reforms will contribute to better sector governance, increased system efficiency, more efficient use of resources, \nand enhanced access to and quality of secondary education for all. The enrollment rates at the secondary level are \nstill low, though female enrollment rates have increased significantly. However, the system is characterized by internal \ninefficiency as evidenced by low retention rates and poor results on the part of students. Dropout rates average 52% \nfor secondary education grades 6\u201310 (53% for girls) and 41% for higher secondary education grades 11\u201312 (40% for \ngirls). The major problem is poor teaching quality. Poor and disadvantaged students are affected the most because \nthey rarely have other educational options and cannot afford the fees for additional tuition. While girls' enrollment has \nimproved significantly, their performance and retention in secondary education are undermined by several factors, \nincluding the lack of female teachers. Other factors responsible for the poor quality of secondary education include the \nselection of unsuitable teachers, the unattractive job conditions, the lack of adequate training for teachers, and the \ninadequate  supervision  and  monitoring.  Students\u2019  poor  results  in  the  secondary  school  certificate  and  higher \nsecondary school certificate examinations, especially in the majority of rural schools, are indications of extensive \nwastage. Even successful secondary school graduates find that obtaining gainful employment is difficult, partly \nbecause of the irrelevance of the secondary school curriculum to the labor market\u2019s needs. All these factors \ndiscourage the poor and disadvantaged from pursuing secondary education. Most of the underserved population is \npoor, landless, and rural, representing about 80% of the poor. Most of the benefits of secondary education are reaped \nby the better off: the bottom 20% of families receive 6% of the benefits of secondary education while the top 20% \nreceive around 35%. \n \nEducation is the basis of socioeconomic transformation and advancement and plays a major role in alleviating the \nworst effects of poverty. Globally, education has been linked to a number of poverty-reducing behaviors. Reduced \nfertility rates are noticeable even among women with minimal education, health practices improve and participation in \nhealth clinics increases with education, farmers with education tend to obtain higher yields, and market activity \nincreases in areas where education has been established for some time. The effects of education carry across \ngenerations. People who have been exposed to education view themselves and their roles within the community \ndifferently than those without such exposure. Nationwide, even a modest exposure to education reduces poverty \nlevels substantially. When the head of a household has had only 1 to 4 years of schooling, that household is 37% less \nlikely to be below the lower poverty line. \n \n \n \n \n ", " 8 Appendix 2 \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification:  General intervention  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?                                                           \n \nThose poverty-related factors that affect enrollment, attendance, retention, cycle completion, and progression to \nhigher education and/or the world of work will have to be analyzed. The following factors should be analyzed as \ncauses of dropping out, poor performance in examinations, and poor correlation between external and internal \nassessments: irrelevant courses and curricula, poor quality of teaching and learning in the classroom, unfavorable \nacademic environment at home and at school, and lack of remedial teaching and parental/family support. However, \npoverty is multidimensional in nature, having spatial, ethnic, and gender characteristics. Thus all aspects of poverty \nneed to be assessed to be able to design a project that will effectively address the multifarious needs of and \nconstraints facing disadvantaged groups in relation to their successful participation in the secondary education \nsubsector. The criteria for subproject design and selection also need to be clearly spelled out to address the specific \nconstraints facing rural girls, the rural and urban poor, and ethnic minority groups. One possibility could be the \nprovision of free textbooks, stipends, and free tuition to targeted disadvantaged groups as in the case of primary \neducation, and this option could also be analyzed. Monitoring and evaluation criteria should specifically address all \nthese issues, and both quantitative and qualitative indicators should be provided to measure changes in status. \n \nC.        Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nThe main actors and the direct beneficiaries of the Project will include secondary school students; members of school \nmanagement committees; teachers; teacher trainers and other professional educators in various institutions and \norganizations; educational officials, such as supervisors and managers; and key personnel engaged in formulating \neducational policies, plans, strategies, and regulatory frameworks and overseeing, monitoring, and evaluating their \nimplementation and impacts. The possible options for providing incentives to teachers, especially those serving in \nremote areas and those teaching subjects such as mathematics, science, and English, either in the form of additional \nremuneration and/or in kind (social status, recognition, etc.) could be explored. Extensive consultation by means of \nseminars, workshops, and focus group discussions will be needed with all stakeholder groups to identify the strengths \nand weaknesses of the secondary education sector, while looking at improving the quality and relevance of the \neducation  provided,  ensuring  equitable  access  to  quality  education,  and  improving  the  efficiency  of  planning, \nmanagement, and monitoring. The insights obtained will be helpful in designing the Secondary Education Sector \nImprovement Project II, first by building on the education system\u2019s strengths and then by addressing its weaknesses, \npaying particular attention to system efficiency, decentralized management, increased enrollment of students from \ndisadvantaged groups, higher retention rates, improved results and performance, and enhanced job prospects \n(including self\u2013employment). \n \nIs there a participation strategy?

Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nExisting policies, plans, strategies, and interventions should be reviewed in relation to sustaining the growth in \nenrollment of girls in secondary education and enhancing the cross-generation effects of education. Given the lessons \nlearned from the ongoing Secondary Education Sector Improvement Project, and in line with similar efforts under the \nTeaching Quality Improvement in Secondary Education Project, efforts to hire more female teachers to reach the \ntarget of 30%, especially in rural and remote schools, need to be enhanced, not only to improve girls\u2019 access to \nsecondary education, but also to provide more female role models for girls. Efforts to attract and retain qualified \nwomen to take up teaching in rural secondary schools as a profession by ensuring a gender-friendly environment in \nschools and dormitories in rural upazilas (subdistricts), which would both improve girls\u2019 access and enhance the \ncareer prospects of female teachers, need to be continued. Representation by women teachers and mothers on \nschool  management  committees  should  be  supported  in  line  with  similar  efforts  under  the  Teaching  Quality \nImprovement in Secondary Education Project. Mainstreaming gender dimensions in curricula and materials needs \nfurther attention. In addition to issues related to girls\u2019 secondary education, a focus on issues affecting boys\u2019 success \nin secondary education is also important.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?
