Over the past decade, the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC) has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance on five occasions on \nbehalf  of  its  special  committee  charged  with  responsibility  for  overseeing  environmental \nlegislation.    That  committee  is  now  known  as  the  Environment  Protection  and  Resources \nConservation  Committee  (EPRCC).    Following  a  request  by  EPRCC  for  further  technical \nassistance (TA) to be rendered during the Government\u2019s current Five-Year Legislative Program \n(2003-2008), a fact-finding mission visited the PRC in February 2004.  The proposed TA was \nincluded in the country strategy and program update (2004\u20132006) for the PRC.1  The scope of \nthe assistance was further refined during the course of the year, most recently during a further \nvisit to the PRC in October 2004.  This report is based on the understandings reached with the \nGovernment and EPRCC on the objectives, scope, costs and implementation arrangements for \nthe TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Biodiversity provides the basis for the survival of human societies and for their economic \nand social development. The best way to safeguard biodiversity is through nature reserves and \nsimilar protected areas.  The PRC\u2019s government has shown its commitment to the conservation \nof the country\u2019s ecological environment by steadily increasing the number of nature reserves \ncountrywide, particularly since the beginning of the 1990s following ratification by the PRC of \nthe Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). 3 \n3.  The PRC ranks in the world's top three countries for biodiversity and it has a higher \nproportion of the world\u2019s endemic species than any other country. It is home to 30,000 species \nof seed plants, 6,300 species of vertebrates, and 3,862 species of fish.4 Chinese plant species \nare estimated to represent over 11% of the world\u2019s total, among which over 240 species or \ngenera are endemic to the PRC. The reptile, bird, mammal and amphibian species in the PRC \naccount  for  over  10%  of  the  world\u2019s  total.    Despite  this  richness,  however,  the  PRC\u2019s \nenvironment has suffered severe damage in recent years because of rapid population growth, \nunsustainable exploitation of resources, environmental pollution, and ecosystem destruction.  All \nof this has resulted in great loss to the PRC\u2019s biodiversity. To meet the threats to its biological \nresources, by the end of 2003 the PRC had established 1,999 nature reserves covering more \nthan 14,000 square kilometers (km2) and accounting for about 14% of its territory.   Most of \nthese reserves have been established in the past 10 years. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2004.

The PRC\u2019s legislative framework for nature reserves and protected areas has not kept \npace with these developments. The responsibility for administering these various protected \nhabitats rests with at least six different government departments or agencies.5  A number of \ndifferent regulations and other management measures are in place,6 but there is no overarching \nlaw.  The underdeveloped nature of the legislative framework has now been recognized by the \nGovernment, leading to NPC being designated as the body responsible for overseeing the \ndrafting of a new nature reserve law.  Since early 2003, EPRCC has been commissioning in-\ndepth studies of how existing regulations are being applied from within the Government - e.g. \nfrom  the  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  (SEPA)  and  the  State  Forestry \nAdministration (SFA) - and also from nongovernment organizations such as the South-North \nInstitute for Sustainable Development.  It is expected that these reports will be completed no \nlater than June 2005.  One of the tasks of the consultants under this TA will be to assist EPRCC \nin its consideration of the findings and recommendations of these reports and to provide case \nstudies of different approaches to this area of the law in other jurisdictions.  EPRCC is due to \nsubmit its proposed draft of a new nature reserve law to NPC no later than mid-2006.   \n5.  Soil degradation, which is closely related to biodiversity loss, now threatens not simply \nbiodiversity but the quality of life generally for the PRC's 1.3 billion people. The PRC now has \nmany of the worst soil degradation problems in the world, with over 40% of its land area, or \nbetween 3-4 million km2, adversely affected.7  Recent reports from the Chinese Academy of \nSciences indicate that trends in soil degradation caused by wind erosion, salinization, and \ndesertification are increasing.  The rate of expansion has risen from around 1,500 km2 per year \nin the 1950s to approaching 3,500 km2 per year in the late 1990s. Annual soil loss is estimated \nto be 5 billion tons. There is growing recognition worldwide that a sound legal and institutional \nframework for managing soils is critical for the conservation of biological diversity as well as for \nfood production and poverty alleviation.   \n6.  Various important global environmental strategies have been developed in recent years.8 \nOne of these, UNEP\u2019s Montevideo Programme III (The Programme for the Development and \nPeriodic Review of Environmental Law for the first Decade of the Twenty-First Century)9 was \nfinalized in 2001, and emphasizes the implementation of environmental law.  Under its objective \nfor soils (objective 12), it proposes two actions: first, a review of domestic land use laws, and \nchanges to land use laws and tenure systems to achieve soil conservation and reclamation \ngoals; and second, promotion of the integration of soil conservation measures into relevant \n                                                \n5   The State Environmental Protection Administration, the State Forestry Administration, Ministry of Agriculture, \nMinistry of Water Resources, Ministry of Land and Resources, and Ministry of Science and Technology. \n6   The chief of which are the Regulations of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Nature Reserves, adopted by the \nState Council in 1994; there are also Temporary Regulations for Scenic Landscape and Historical Sites, and \nManagement Measures for Forest Parks. \n7   Soil degradation includes wind and water erosion; overgrazing and loss of biomass in grasslands; deforestation; \nand related disturbances to the hydrological balance resulting in erratic river flows, excessive crop nutrient loss, \nsoil fertility decline, poor soil drainage, and salinization. \n8   For example, (i) The UNEP Montevideo Programme III 2000; (ii) The Plan of Implementation of the World \nSummit on Sustainable Development, Johannesburg, 2002; (iii) The World Soils Agenda 2002, promulgated by \nthe International Union of Soil Sciences, (iv) The Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the \nConvention to Combat Desertification, established in 2002; and (v) UNEP\u2019s Strategy on Land Use Management \nand Soil Conservation. \n9   UNEP. 2001. The Programme for the Development and Periodic Review of Environmental Law for the first \nDecade of the Twenty-First Century. Nairobi.  \n ", "  3\ndomestic laws, taking into account relevant international treaties such as the United Nations \nConvention to Combat Desertification. What is being called for, in other words, is a general \ninitiative  for  soil  legislation  reform,  including  undertaking  actions  such  as  improving  the \neffectiveness of environmental law on soils, improving the conservation and management of \nsoil,  and  forging  better  links  between  environmental  law  on  soils  and  other  fields  of \nenvironmental law.10 \n7.  The PRC Government recognizes that combating soil degradation needs to be made a \nnational development priority. Its commitment to sustainable natural resource management is \nreflected in the Tenth Five-Year Plan, 2001\u20132005 which, among other things, calls for increased \nprotection for land, forests, and grassland.  An overarching, holistic soil protection law has not \nyet been included in the Government\u2019s national legislative program11, but work has been started \nat the provincial level and it is probably only a matter of time before a national legal and \ninstitutional framework for managing soils is placed on the legislative agenda12. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The TA will provide assistance covering the two possible laws on (i) nature reserve \nzones, and (ii) soil protection. \n1.  Nature Reserve Zone Law \n9.  The PRC has now set up about 2,000 nature reserves, of which around 200 are national \nreserves. Together they cover about 14% of the PRC\u2019s total land area. The establishment and \nmanagement of these nature reserves is currently governed primarily by regulations adopted by \nthe State Council in 1994. EPRCC has been designated by NPC as the agency responsible for \ndrafting a law to govern nature reserve zones and is scheduled begin this task in early 2005 and \ncomplete it by mid-2006. A symposium to consider the findings and recommendations of the \nconsultants will be held towards the end of the law drafting process, probably in the first quarter \nof 2006. \n10.  Under the TA, a firm will be engaged to provide the international consultants to advise \nEPRCC in connection with the review and drafting process. For the purpose of this TA, the term \n\u201cfirm\u201d will be interpreted broadly, and could include a nongovernment organization, a university, \nor a scientific or environmental institution. The chosen firm will be responsible for engaging a \nteam of local consultants to assist. \n                                                \n10   See also Hannam, Ian, and Ben Boer. 2004. Drafting Legislation for Sustainable Soils: A Guide.  IUCN \nEnvironmental Policy and Law Paper No. 52,  page 14. IUCN. \n11   There exists a national law directly related to soil, the Water and Soil Conservation Law (1991).  However, this \nlaw does not cover all issues on soils, in particular the prevention or abatement of soil degradation resulting from \nagricultural and industrial activities. \n12   The ADB is currently working closely with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) on the China-GEF Partnership \non Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems which has the goal of promoting sustainable development in the \nPRC\u2019s western region.  The ADB is also providing TA for a number of local initiatives in the PRC\u2019s north east: \nADB. 2003. Songhua River Water Quality and Pollution Control Management. Manila.  Under the TA to support \nTransjurisdictional  Environment  Management  (see  footnote  2(v)  above),  the  ADB  is  also  assisting  the \nGovernment in the development of relevant legislation. \n ", "4    \n11.  The international consultants will also work with EPRCC in designing a study tour to one \nselected country. The goal of the trip will be to visit government officials, academic institutions \nand NGOs so as to reach a better understanding of international legislative trends and key \nissues in nature reserve management.   \n12.  In addition to the final symposium, the international consultants may also be requested \nto  organize  one  or  more  workshops  to  provide  forums  for  the review of the findings and \nrecommendations of the ongoing studies commissioned by EPRCC.  The extent and timing of \nsuch workshops will depend upon the output of those ongoing studies and on the issues raised.  \nProvision has been made under the TA to engage resource persons to participate in such \nworkshops should they be required. \n13.  The international consultants (four or five persons) should be experts on nature reserves \ngenerally, nature reserve management, and nature reserve law. The domestic consultants (up \nto eight persons) should be experts in the fields of nature reserve zone law, environmental law, \nnature reserve zone management, and nature reserves generally. \n2.  Legislative Proposals for Sustainable Soils \n14.  At this stage, EPRCC\u2019s expectations are that only a feasibility study will be required of \nthe consultant(s) engaged under this part of the TA, although the study will contain a suggested \nform or forms of draft legislation. The consultants may be engaged either as individuals or as a \nfirm. The scope of this part of the TA will be reviewed during the period of the TA, with final \ndecisions regarding scope and timing being dependent partly on EPRCC\u2019s work program, and \npartly on whether any savings have been realized under the earlier parts of the TA.  The bulk of \nthe work under this part of the TA is likely to be completed in 2006. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA will assist the government agency responsible for developing key environment \nlegislation by exposing it to best international practice. \n16.  The TA will provide support to the legislative process through the following inputs: \n(i)  a  comprehensive  review  and  assessment  of  the  existing  legislative \nframework dealing with environmental protection, in particular as it touches \nupon nature reserve zones and protection of the soil; and \n(ii)  advice on the establishment of a more modern framework for legislation \nconcerning nature reserves and sustainable soils; formulation of legislative \nplans and procedures affecting these areas in particular, and possibly others \nas required; preparation of draft laws as case studies; a comparative study on \ninternational best practices in these and related areas. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent, of which $243,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $257,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested that ADB finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$157,000 equivalent of the local currency cost.  The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant \nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will \n ", "  5\nfinance the balance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $100,000, through the provision of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  conference  venues,  local  transportation,  local \ncommunications, interpretation and translation services, the administration for workshops and \nsymposiums and other miscellaneous administration expenses.  Detailed cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are shown in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be EPRCC.  Management of the TA is expected to \nbe assisted by a part\u2013time consultant to be engaged by ADB under a separate budget. It is \nintended that this part\u2013time consultant, who will have a permanent office at the ADB resident \nmission, will liaise regularly with EPRCC staff to ensure smooth and rapid implementation of the \nTA.  This individual will also oversee the establishment and operation of any advance payment \nfacility created in support of the program of workshops and symposiums. \n19.  It is also expected that EPRCC will liaise, and will require the consultants to liaise, with \nall  affected  parties.  These  will  include,  but  will  not  necessarily  be  limited  to,  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of \nWater  Resources,  Ministry  of  Land  and  Resources,  State  Environmental  Protection \nAdministration,  Chinese  Academy  of  Sciences,  State  Forestry  Administration,  Ministry  of \nScience  and  Technology,  the  South-North  Institute  for  Sustainable  Development,  NPC\u2019s \nLegislative Work Committee, and the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council. \n20.  Services  of  both  international  and  domestic  consultants  will  be  required  and  also \nresource persons where appropriate.   Details of the services to be provided by the consultants \nare in Appendix 3. All consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The implementation of the TA is expected to begin in May \n2005 and to be completed by November 2006. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.

To carry out the technical assistance (TA), consultants will be engaged by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), either as individuals or as a firm,13 to assist the Environmental \nProtection  and  Resources  Conservation  Committee  (EPRCC)  of  the  National  People\u2019s \nCongress (NPC).  \n2.  As part of the current legislative program of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC),  \nEPRCC is required to have a draft nature reserve zone law ready by mid-2006, and a feasibility \nstudy on a possible soil protection law by the end of 2006. Separate teams of consultants will be \nengaged to assist with work related to each law. \nA.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Nature Reserve Zone Law   \n3.  Implementation of this part of the TA will take place in three phases. \n(i)  Phase I. Three consultants (one international and two domestic) will carry \nout  a  general  background  study  to  complement  more  in-depth  but \nnarrower  studies  being  carried  out  by  various  government  and \ngovernment-related agencies. The international consultant, who will act \nas team leader throughout all three phases, will supply an overview of \ninternational experience and best practice in this area. The two domestic \nconsultants  will  provide  background  studies  on  (i)  the  present  legal \ninfrastructure, and (ii) the actual administration of nature reserve zones \nand protected areas throughout the PRC. The three individual reports \nresulting from phase I will identify main issues and problems. Phase I will \nbe completed within 2 months. \n(ii)  Phase II. The international consultant will head a team of up to eight \ndomestic consultants and resource persons in carrying out studies in \nspecific areas highlighted in phase I. The international consultant will \ndevelop case studies from a representative sampling of foreign countries \nidentified at the completion of phase I, and analyze key issues to be \ncovered in any legislative framework.  The domestic consultants will each \ncomplete a separate study on their area of specialization. Phase II is \nexpected to last three months.  \n(iii)  Phase III. The consultants will prepare a final report by November 2005. \nThis will include recommendations on the legal framework. The report \nand draft law will be the subject of an international symposium in early \n2006. \n                                                \n13   The term \u201cfirm\u201d could include a nongovernment organization, an academic institution or similar. \n ", "    Appendix 3  11 \nThe international consultant should be a lawyer with experience in law drafting and \npolicy formulation, and also with experience in the establishment and management of \nnature reserves or equivalent. The domestic consultants are expected to be made up of \na  combination  of  legal  experts,  management  experts  and  technical  experts.      The \nconsultants should also be qualified to conduct workshops and recruit resource persons \nthroughout this three-phase process.  The scope and size of these workshops will be \ndecided during the course of the TA. \n2.   Legislative Proposals for Sustainable Soils  \n4.  The implementation of this part of the TA will involve a single phase. Three consultants \n(one international and two domestic) will undertake a feasibility study on how the PRC might \ndevelop a future legislative framework to address issues of soil degradation.  \n5.  Once completed, the study would be provided as a report to all EPRCC congressmen. If \ndesired,  a  workshop  to  discuss  the  report\u2019s  recommendations  could  be  organized  to \ndisseminate the report to a wider audience.  \nB.  Terms of Reference \n1.  Nature Reserve Zone Law \na.  International Consultants (total of 5.5 person-months) \n6.  During phase I, the consultants will perform the following tasks.  \n(i)  Carry out comparative studies, and individually review general legal frameworks \nrelating to nature reserve zone management in a representative sampling of \nother  countries.  These  studies  will  analyze  experience  in  legislation  and \nmanagement  of  nature  reserve  zones  in  these  countries,  and  recommend \nsuitable legal frameworks for nature reserve zone conservation in the PRC.  \n(ii)  In consultation with domestic consultants, prepare terms of reference for the \ndomestic consultants to be engaged under phase II. \n(iii)  Design a study tour to enable key staff involved in the formulation of the new law \nto  visit  one  country  for  consultations  with  all  relevant  groups  including \ngovernment officials, legal drafters, NGOs and local communities. \n7.  During phase II, the consultants will perform the following tasks. \n(i)  Provide an in-depth study of best practice on successful nature reserve zone \nmanagement  in  selected  countries,  and  evaluate  what  practices  are  most \napplicable to the PRC.  Based on this study, they will recommend how to improve \nnature reserve zone management in the PRC.  \n(ii)  Oversee  the  work  of  the  domestic  consultants  in  preparing  their  individual \nreports. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \n8.  During phase III, the consultants will perform the following tasks. \n(i)  Recommend and draft appropriate legislation.  \n(ii)  Organize an international symposium. \nb.  Domestic Consultants (total of 30 person-months) \n9.  During phase I, two domestic consultants will undertake a background study of the way \nnature reserve zones are currently established and managed in the PRC. In the course of this \nstudy, they will review existing laws, regulations and policies affecting nature reserve zones. \nThey will examine the implementation of such laws, regulations and policies, and evaluate how \nsuccessful such policies and regulations have been to date. Working with the international \nconsultant,  they  will  identify  key  legal  issues  of  nature  reserve  zone  management  and \nconservation in the PRC.  These issues will be studied in further depth under phase II.  \n10.  It is anticipated that phase II consultants will address such issues as: \n(i)  nature reserve zone planning, \n (ii)  management systems and key instruments and mechanisms for administering \nnature reserves and protected areas, \n (iii)  land ownership and tenure issues, \n (iv)  public participation, \n(v)  categorization of nature reserves, and \n(vi)  financial mechanisms for funding nature reserves and protected areas. \n11.  Under phase III, selected consultants from phases I and II will assist the international \nconsultant  in  the  drafting  of  recommended  legislation  for  discussion  at  an  international \nsymposium. \n2.  Legislative Proposals for Sustainable Soils  \na.  International Consultants (total of 1.5 person-months) and Domestic \nConsultants (total of 4 person-months) \n12.  The output of this part of the TA will be a feasibility study carried out by one or more \ninternational consultants ( lawyers specializing in the drafting of legislation for sustainable soils), \nwith the assistance of two domestic consultants (one to research and collate all existing national \nand provincial legislation and related legal instruments, and the other to assist with report writing \nand legal drafting). \n13.  The report resulting from this feasibility study should do the following, among other \nthings.  \n(i)  Include an assessment of all laws and regulations currently in place in the PRC \nthat  address  the  issue  of  soil  pollution,  including  addressing  the  issue  of \nenforcement of existing laws. \n ", "    Appendix 3  13 \n(ii)  Include  a  summary  and  brief  assessment  of  the  various  initiatives  already \nunderway at the provincial level addressing the issue of soil pollution. \n(iii)  Provide  a  general  overview  of  all  current  international  legal  and  institutional \nregimes   for soil. It should highlight the strategies and processes behind present \nefforts  to  promote  an  international  legal  framework  to  protect  the  soil \nenvironment. It should summarize those international instruments, both binding \nand nonbinding, that are directed at improving the conservation, rehabilitation \nand sustainable use of soils at global or regional levels. \n(iv)  Provide a representative overview of different national legal strategies for soil, \nincluding  a  review  of  existing  national  soil  legislation  frameworks,  and  the \nelements needed for effective national soil legislation. It should highlight those \nnational legal strategies that to date have been most successful in enabling \nindividual nations to make sound land use and land management decisions, and \nin building capacity to communicate these strategies. \n(iv)  Recommend which national legislative framework is most suitable for the PRC, \nand offer samples of appropriate legislation to establish such a framework at the \nnational level. \n14.  If  called  upon  following  submission  of  the  report,  the  consultants  should  make \nthemselves available to conduct one or more training sessions on the contents of the report. \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20050124084333+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20041223173017Z", "Title": "TA__PRC_ Support for Environmental Legislation - accepted \u2026", "Creator": "TA__PRC_ Support for Environmental Legislation - accepted changes - Microsoft Word", "Author": "ac2", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT"}}
