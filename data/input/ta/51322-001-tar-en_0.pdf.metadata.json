The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation \nsupport and capacity building, strengthen due diligence, and increase project readiness to a \nseries of ensuing projects identified in the country operations business plans, 2018\u20132020, for \nBangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Initially, the TA will support (i) BAN: Ganges Kobadak \nIrrigation Modernization Project, (ii) BAN: Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Program, (iii) BAN: \nMarket and Value Chain Infrastructure Development Project, (iv) BHU: Bhutan Integrated Irrigated \nAgriculture Development Project, (v) NEP: Mechanized Irrigation Innovation Project, (vi) NEP: \nPreparation of Priority River Basins Flood Risk Management Project, (vii) NEP: Bagmati River \nBasin  Improvement  Project\u2013Additional  Financing,  (viii)  NEP:  Nepal  Rural  Connectivity \nImprovement Project, and (ix) SRI: Mahaweli Water Security Investment Program. These projects \nare all in the rural sector and require similar due diligences. The TA facility approach is suitable \nas it will (i) enhance project preparation efficiency and improve readiness for projects that have \nlimited processing resources; (ii) reap important synergies from working with the same team of \nconsultants,  including  reducing  lengthy  tendering  processes  and  improving  knowledge \ntransference; and (iii) strengthen coordination. Overall, this TA will reduce transaction costs \nthrough minimizing the need for stand-alone transaction TAs.  \n \n2.  The TA will also provide capacity building support to ongoing projects, initially supporting \nthe BAN: Irrigation Management Improvement Project.1 The ongoing projects are suffering from \nweak project implementation capacity and require similar technical specialist support to ensure \nproject sustainability. The TA will only support projects that are listed in the country operations \nbusiness plans.  \n \n3.  South Asia is experiencing rapid overall economic growth; however, economic disparity \nbetween urban and rural areas remains. Overall incidence of poverty has been reducing in South \nAsia but the incidence of poverty in rural areas, although declining at a greater rate, remains \nabove  those  in  urban  areas.2 Contributing  to  this  is  the  absence  of  well-planned  rural \ninfrastructure which undermines agricultural productivity and increases vulnerability to natural \nhazards and climate change. A key cause is the region\u2019s rural infrastructure stakeholders\u2014\ncomprising local, state, and central governments, private sector (consultants and contractors), \nand academic institutions\u2014are constrained by weak capacities and poor coordination in the \nplanning,  design,  and  implementation  of  projects.  Exposure  to  new  innovations  and  good \npractices in the sector is limited, resulting in the continuation of \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d approach. \nThe result is persistently slow progress in meeting targets for rural development, poor design, \npoor construction supervision, poor performance and sustainability of the assets as well as limited \nconsideration of external factors such as climate change.  \n \n4.  Investment in rural areas is identified as an important underlying component of the \ninclusive growth strategy  in the Asian Development Bank (ADB)  midterm review  (MTR) of \nStrategy 2020.3 ADB\u2019s investments in this area have generated jobs, raised rural incomes, and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nreduced poverty.4 The MTR emphasizes the need for strengthening the capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies for effective project implementation to achieve inclusive and sustainable \ndevelopment. This strengthening is also essential to support the MTR objectives in streamlining \nADB business processes to strengthen development effectiveness and ensuring ADB delivers \nvalue for money. \n \n5.  South Asia\u2019s rural agriculture and natural resources portfolio performance needs to be \nimproved with challenges throughout the project cycle leading to underperforming projects. 5  Lack \nof project readiness to meet ADB requirements governing procurement, selection of consultants, \nsafeguards including resettlement and land acquisition, and other thematic areas (governance \nand  gender)  has  led  to  significant  implementation  delays.  Furthermore,  weak  project \nimplementation and management capacity of executing and implementing agencies has been a \ncontinuous challenge for improved portfolio performance. Specific issues have included (i) lack of \ngovernment capacity to address complex project implementation challenges, particularly when a \nproject needs restructuring; (ii) slow procurement of construction works; (iii) lack of attention to \nsafeguards monitoring and reporting; (iv) poor contract management and construction supervision \nresulting in poor contractor and consultant performance and low quality works; and (iv) lack of \nknowledge sharing on best practices and innovations across sectors. Government unfamiliarity \nwith ADB processes and poor communication with ADB project teams has also contributed to \npoor project performance.  \n \n6.  Continuous support to enhance skills and competencies of executing and implementing \nagencies  are  needed  to  improve  project  preparation,  implementation  and  overall  portfolio \nperformance. Sustainable development of ADB water and rural infrastructure projects requires \nstronger interaction between stakeholders coupled with dedicated government capacity building \nin the areas of project design and implementation. The TA would bridge capability gaps and \nenable the application of best practices to ADB-funded projects. Capacity building support will be \nprovided through the provision of incremental individual consulting services to enhance project \npreparatory and project implementation capacity.  The TA will be demand-driven to ensure \nownership by and commitment from the executing and implementing agencies. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n7.  Output  1:  Well-designed  water  and  rural  infrastructure  project  proposals  and \nproject readiness achieved. Technical expertise will be provided to South Asia developing \nmember countries (DMCs) to support preparation of selected investment projects for potential \nADB financing. This will include necessary due diligences involving assessments of (i) technical \nsuitability; (ii) economic, financial and social viability; (iii) capacity and institutional issues; and \n(iv) environmental and social safeguards, and identification of measures to strengthen project \nimplementation capacity for water and rural investment projects. Assistance to meet project \nreadiness  conditions  will  also  be  provided  including  recruitment  activities  for  project \nimplementation consultants and providing technical inputs for loan processing. Detailed activities \nwill include, when required, support for (i) feasibility studies required for the ensuing investment; \n(ii) economic analysis; (iii) financial management assessment, financial evaluation and financial \nanalysis; (iv) gender analysis, collection of baseline data and gender action plans; (v) risk \nassessment and management plans; (vi) safeguards documents on environment, involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples; (vii) climate adaptation measures; (viii) sector assessment; \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2010.

Output 2: Project implementation and management capacity of executing agency \nimproved. Technical expertise and capacity building will be provided to selected executing \nagencies in South Asia to enhance water and rural investment sustainability. Support will be \nprovided through consultants, as needed, to ongoing or ensuing water and rural investments and \nprograms  within  the  core TA  priority  areas. The focus  will  be  on  enhancing  procurement, \nconstruction and contract management, fiduciary requirements and safeguard processes, and \nmonitoring capacity. The TA will utilize the same consultants across multiple projects to allow \nknowledge transfer of best practices. Support will also include provision of workshops and on the-\njob-training to enhance DMC capacity.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. The TA scope is expected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and outcome, and be replenished from time to time as funds are \nrequired and identified. \n \n10.  The governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, training venues, office supplies, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions such as taxes and duties. Activities in each participating country will be financed \nafter obtaining the no objection of the specific government. The governments were informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  The TA activities for preparing an ensuing project will start only after the relevant project \nconcept paper is approved by ADB.  ADB will administer the TA. The South Asia Department\u2019s \nEnvironment,  Natural  Resources,  and  Agriculture  Division  will  be  responsible  for  TA \nimplementation, working closely with executing and implementing agencies in South Asia DMCs. \nThe TA will be implemented over 30 months from January 2018 to June 2020. Disbursements \nunder the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2018\u2013June 2020  \nExecuting agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \n  ICS (international)  13.25 person-months  $371,000 \n  ICS (national)  11.25 person-months  $33,800 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  None \narrangement upon TA completion \nICS = individual consultant selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n12.

The TA will provide 24.5 person months of consulting services \n(13.25 person-months, international and 11.25 person-months, national) in the field of rural \ninfrastructure (water resources and irrigation), procurement, economics, financial management, \nenvironment, safeguards, social development and project coordination. The consultants will be \nrecruited using individual consultant selection method based on the requirements of each project \nand deployed based on each project\u2019s needs. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated project administration instructions/TA Staff Instructions.6  \n \nE.  Governance  \n13.   Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk assessments for \nfinancial management, procurement, and integrity for ensuing investment projects implemented \nin any of the target countries will be conducted under the TA. \n \nII.
