INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Operations  Evaluation  Office  (OEO)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)\nsupports ADB\u2019s vision through excellence and independence in evaluation. OEO\u2019s mandate has\nbroadened and has become considerably more demanding over the past several years. In\naddition  to  its  traditional  focus  on  the  performance  of  completed  projects,  programs,  and\ntechnical assistance (TA), OEO has concentrated on (i) preparing evaluation studies aimed at\nmore intensive investigations of particular thematic issues; (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of\nADB\u2019s operations, practices, and procedures; (iii) providing real time feedback on ongoing\noperations; (iv) monitoring and reporting on actions taken by ADB and its executing agencies in\nresponse to OEO evaluation report recommendations; (v) building evaluation capacity within\nand outside ADB to enhance self-evaluation; and (vi) coordinating closely with multilateral and\nbilateral  aid  agencies  on  evaluation  through  the  Working  Party  on  Aid  Evaluation  of  the\nDevelopment  Assistance  Committee  of  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and\nDevelopment and the multilateral development banks\u2019 Evaluation Cooperation Group.\n2. OEO has put together its 2001 work program cognizant of the escalating pressures on\nADB to demonstrate its development effectiveness and the intensifying clamor for independently\nvalidated performance information to stockholders. In addition to preparing performance audit\nreports, the 2001 work program will continue to focus on thematic issues that are relevant to\nADB  operations.  These  include  studies  in  the  areas  of  poverty  reduction;  environment;\nusefulness of economic and sector work; effectiveness of regional technical assistance (RETA);\nperformance management in ADB, executing agencies, and planning agencies; and impact\nassessment of projects funded by the Asian Development Fund (ADF). The work program will\nalso increase the coverage of performance audit reports from 30 to 40 percent for projects and\nto  100  percent  for  program  loans.  OEO  will  target  completion  of  about  47  major  reports\n(Appendix 1).\n3. OEO will focus on more effective feedback and use of lessons learned by closely\nexamining  (i)  project  and  TA  proposals,  and  (ii)  project  completion  reports  (PCRs)  (about\n50 percent of completed PCRs will be subjected to in-depth review) to help improve the self-\nevaluation capacity of operational departments and reliability of project success ratings. Training\nsupport  for  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS),  logical  frameworks,  and\nperformance  indicators  aimed  at  improving  design  of  new  projects,  and  the  monitoring,\nmanagement, and impact assessment of ongoing projects will also be expanded. In addition,\nOEO will monitor and report on actions taken by ADB and its executing agencies in response to\nOEO evaluation report recommendations. OEO will continue its effort of building evaluation\ncapability in selected developing member countries (DMCs). Through the use of its follow-up\naction reports, OEO will strive to mainstream evaluation findings in ADB\u2019s policy and decision\nmaking processes for management and staff. This paper describes a proposed RETA which\ncovers eight evaluation studies.1 The RETA framework is presented in Appendix 2.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. To  simplify  the  funding  procedure  for  its  operations  as  well  as  to  ensure  its\nindependence  in  carrying  out  its  mandate,  OEO  requested  a  change  in  procedure  during\nsubmission  of  its  2001  budget  requirements  to  the  Budget,  Personnel  and  Management\nSystems Department (BPMSD) in September 2000. The requested change in procedure would\nrequire  the  administrative  budget  (i.e.,  staff  consultant  budget)  to  finance  the  consultant\n                                                \n1 The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 November 2000.", "2\nrequirements for all evaluation activities, including those studies such as impact evaluation\nstudies, special evaluation studies, and country assistance program evaluation (CAPE) for\nwhich consultant requirements in the past were financed separately from the indicative planning\nfigure (IPF) allocation from RETA funds and approved by the President. BPMSD responded that\nthe  administrative  budget  could  support  only  the  consultant  requirements  needed  for\nproject/program performance audit reports, technical assistance performance audit reports, and\nthe help desk activities on the PPMS. It suggested that OEO continue its current practice of\nseeking the approval of the President for an annual IPF from RETA funds to finance consultant\ninputs for the other evaluation studies.\n5. The special evaluation studies, i.e., thematic and sector evaluation, now account for\nabout 40 percent of OEO\u2019s work program amounting to about $1.5 million from 1997 to 2000. In\nthe World Bank, the Operations Evaluation Department allocates about $7.9 million to conduct\nsimilar sector and thematic evaluation studies. Acknowledging the operational relevance of this\nimportant  activity,  the  President  on  23  October  2000  approved  an  annual  RETA  IPF  of\n$1.6 million for OEO to conduct such evaluation studies in 2001, the same amount approved for\n1999 and 2000. OEO traditionally selects topics for study in close consultation with ADB\u2019s\noperational departments.\n6. In  1999,  OEO  completed  seven  impact  and  special  evaluation  studies:  (i)  Impact\nEvaluation  Study  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  Program  of  Subregional  Economic\nCooperation in the Greater Mekong Subregion; (ii) Impact Evaluation Study of the Technical and\nVocational  Education  Projects  in  Malaysia,  Pakistan,  Papua  New  Guinea,  and  Sri  Lanka;\n(iii) Special Evaluation Study of the Role of Nongovernment Organizations and Community-\nBased Organizations in Asian Development Bank Projects; (iv) Special Evaluation Study of the\nEffectiveness of ADB Approaches and Assistance to Poverty Reduction in Bangladesh, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, and Philippines; (v) Country Assistance\nProgram Evaluation in the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam; (vi) Special Evaluation Study on the\nPolicy  Impact  of  Involuntary  Resettlement;  and  (vii)  Impact  Evaluation  Study  of  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank Assistance to the Roads Sector in Nepal.\n7. Five  special  studies  were  undertaken  in  2000:  (i)  Country  Assistance  Program\nEvaluation for the Philippines; (ii) Special Evaluation Study on the Policy Implementation and\nImpact of Agriculture and Natural Resources Research; (iii) Special Evaluation Study on Gender\nand Development; (iv) Special Evaluation Study on Sustainability of Policy Reforms through\nAdvisory Technical Assistance; and (v) Special Evaluation Study on Program Lending.\n8. In preparing the 2001 work program, OEO considered the operational relevance of the\nprogram, and ADB\u2019s strategic objectives, policies, and operations. The evaluation studies as\nindicated in Appendix 3 aim to assess the relevance, efficacy, efficiency, and impact of ADB\noperations to provide real time feedback to the DMCs and ADB to strengthen the effectiveness\nand efficiency of future operations. Lessons emerging from the studies are intended to help\nimprove (i) ADB's country and sectoral strategies; (ii) the design of future projects, especially\nthose  with  particular  implications  for  the  ADB\u2019s  operational  strategies;  and  (iii)  project\nimplementation.\nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The objective of this RETA is to finance consulting requirements of eight evaluation\nstudies designed to (i) assess the relevance, effectiveness, efficacy, and impacts of various", "3\nADB operational activities, and (ii) provide timely feedback on a broad range of operational\nissues to the DMCs and ADB. These evaluation studies will also provide relevant operational\nfindings (such as lessons learned and follow-up actions) and timely feedback on best practices\nto strengthen ADB operations in the DMCs.\nB.  Scope\n10. The scope of each study follows.\n11. Impact Evaluation Study of ADB Assistance in the Power Sector in Indonesia. The\npower sector has been the traditional area of ADB support for energy in Indonesia. ADB\u2019s\nintervention has largely focused on developing non-oil-based power generation and associated\ntransmission, distributing electricity to existing and new consumers, integrating isolated systems\noutside Java, improving supply efficiency, and developing human resources. Within this context,\nthe power sector needs to be restructured to enable it to support the move to a competitive\nenvironment  based  on  the  recommendations  of  ADB  and  World  Bank  strategic  studies,\nundertaken in the mid-1990s. The rationale for the study is therefore based on the strategic\nimportance of the power sector and the consequent need for its reform to contribute to the\ncountry\u2019s ongoing economic prosperity. This study aims to assess the relevance and long-term\ndevelopment impact of ADB assistance.\n12. The study will evaluate ADB\u2019s operations in the power sector and assess their role in\ndeveloping  a  modern,  efficient,  and  increasingly  commercialized  power  market  within  the\ncountry. The scope will include the performance aspects and development impacts of all power\nprojects which commenced and were completed since 1980, namely: (i) Java Transmission\n(I and II), (ii) Second Sulawesi Power, (iii) Transmission and Distribution System Development,\n(iv) Power XVIII, (v) Power XIX, (vi) Power XX, and (vii) Power XXI. The study will comprise an\nassessment of these projects, including a review of ADB documents, field visits to selected\nproject sites within the country, socioeconomic impact surveys of beneficiaries, and discussions\nwith those involved in project implementation.\n13. Impact of Rural Roads on Poverty Reduction. Road sector projects contribute to\npoverty reduction through their indirect impacts on economic growth and direct impact on the\npersonal welfare of the poor. What exact impact a project has on poverty reduction hinges on\nboth the type of infrastructure or services, and the areas and people the project serves. Rural\nroads in poor areas make only a modest contribution to national growth, but they have a\nsignificant direct impact on the daily life of the poor. Benefits in rural roads are less likely to be\nderived from road user cost savings because of the generally low traffic volumes, but rather\nfrom improvements to access to markets, services, and information, and the changes these can\nhave  on  farming,  personal  travel,  living  conditions,  and  social  development.  Moreover,\nconstruction and maintenance often can be done using labor-intensive means offering scope for\nemployment of poverty groups. The study aims to quantify the main impacts of rural roads on\npoverty, focusing on employment during construction and subsequent maintenance, and from\nroad usage.\n14. The study will identify and quantify the main impacts of rural roads on poverty. All types\nof impacts are to be included, both income- and nonincome-related, such as improved travel,\nliving  conditions,  education,  empowerment,  and  access  to  information  and  resources.\nSecondary benefits, such as the opening up of areas for subsequent installation of electric\npower reticulation, and negative impacts such as from environmental degradation are also to be\nconsidered.  Special  attention  will  be  given  to  estimating  the  impacts  of  construction  and\nmaintenance, such as through employment and material supply operations, and the added", "4\nimpact on poverty that labor-intensive construction and maintenance methods can confer. The\nstudy will select and review completed and ongoing rural road projects in three countries which\nare  yet  to  be  determined  by  the  study  methodology  framework.  Field  surveys  of  relevant\nstakeholders will be conducted.\n15. Special  Evaluation  Study  on  Poverty  Reduction:  A  Comparative  Assessment\nBetween Successful and Unsuccessful Projects. ADB formally adopted poverty reduction as\none of its five strategic development objectives in its first Medium-Term Strategic Framework\n1992-1995. In 1999, poverty reduction was declared the overarching goal of ADB. Work has\nbegun on a long-term strategic framework (2001-2015) for ADB operations to ensure that all\nactivities are integrated and directed to meeting this overarching goal. In December 1999, OEO\nimplemented a special evaluation study2 of five DMCs to provide evaluative data to assess the\nimpact of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction measures on developing an operational strategy for poverty\nreduction.3 This study is a follow-up assessment of the 1999 study and will cover an evaluation\nof the performance and impact of ADF-funded projects aimed at poverty reduction.\n16. The study will (i) identify why certain ADB projects with poverty reduction as the primary\nor secondary objectives were successful while others were not; (ii) identify the country-specific\nand  sector-specific  factors  which  significantly  affected  the  performance  of  such  projects;\n(iii) assess the level and extent of impact achieved by said projects from the beneficiaries\u2019 point\nof view; and (iv) draw up generalized lessons\u2014both positive (what to do) and negative (what not\nto do)\u2014from the selected projects. The study is proposed to be limited to the agriculture and\nnatural resources, and social infrastructure sectors, as they account for around 60 percent of all\nprojects funded under ADF. A total of 75 projects with project performance audit reports will be\nincluded in the study. Of these, 40 projects will be subjected to in-depth assessment (surveys,\nfocus group discussions) and will be selected from (i) DMCs that have experienced poverty over\nthe long term,  (ii) DMCs hit by the Asian economic crisis, and (iii) the small island DMCs of the\nPacific.\n17. Special Evaluation Study on Economic Sector Work. ADB carries out economic and\nsector work (ESW) both at the country level and across countries using a wide range of\ninstruments such as advisory TA, ESW initiated by staff, and regional economic TA. The report\nof the 1994 Task Force on Improving Project Quality concluded that while ESW is periodically\nundertaken for each DMC, the inputs invested in these exercise are modest and their results do\nnot always link up closely with mainstream ADB operations in the country concerned.4 The 1999\nReport on the Redesign of Operational Business Processes in its assessment of progress made\nsince 1994 concludes that competing demands on limited staff resources have meant that ESW\nis assigned relatively low priority in the work programs of operational departments.5 This study\nwill provide some insight on the ESW that ADB conducted, its usefulness, impact, and influence\non policy and decision-making process.\n18. The  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  assess  the  role  played  by  ESW  in  ADB's\noperations. The study will determine if ESW is used as a strategic instrument by ADB to bring\nabout systematic reforms in the DMCs. This will involve not only looking at the impacts in the\nfield for selected cases, but also at ADB processes. The study will be based on case studies\nwhich will be selected in consultation with the programs departments. The study will compare\n                                                \n2 SST: REG 99024: Effectiveness of ADB Approaches and Assistance to Poverty Reduction in Bangladesh, Kyrgyz\nRepublic, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, and Philippines, December 1999.\n3 ADB. 1999.

The countries to be selected are expected\nto include one large, one very small, and one medium-size country. The study will use a set of\nqualitative indicators and be based on interviews with a large number of stakeholders within\nADB and in-country.\n19. Special Evaluation Study on the Effectiveness of the RETA Process. Through its TA\noperations,  ADB  assists  DMCs  in  (i)  identifying,  formulating,  implementing,  and  operating\ndevelopment  projects;  (ii)  improving  their  institutional  capabilities;  (iii)  formulating  and\ncoordinating development strategies, plans, and programs; and undertaking sector-, policy- and\nissues-oriented studies; and (iv) promoting the transfer of technology. Specifically, through\nRETA, ADB also fosters regional cooperation among DMCs by assisting in preparing regional\nstudies  and  conducting,  by  itself  or  in  cooperation  with  other  organizations,  conferences,\nseminars, workshops, and training courses for participants from several DMCs, thus promoting\nthe role of ADB as a development resource center. Since 1967, ADB has approved 945 RETAs,\ntotaling $341 million covering 252 studies, 265 conferences, 267 training courses, 73 research\ninitiatives, and other activities. At present, approximately 151 RETAs are being administered by\nvarious offices in ADB.\n20. The main purpose of the study is to assess the relevance, effectiveness, and efficacy of\nthe RETA process and the sustainability of impacts from RETA operations. The study will\nconduct a critical analysis of the RETA selection and approval process, and provide feedback\non lessons learned and how these could contribute to the processing and implementation of the\nnew RETAs. Considering the wide coverage of RETA operations, the study will conduct a\ndetailed  analysis  of  carefully  selected  samples  following  a  three-phased  approach:  project\npreparation, monitoring and implementation, and evaluation of results. Specifically, the study will\nassess the quality and long-term impact of the RETA approach by (i) conducting a desk review\nof technical assistance performance audit reports, technical assistance completion reports, and\nother  related  TA  special  studies;  (ii)  reviewing  documents,  institutional  arrangements,  and\npractices of ADB and similar agencies concerned with RETA implementation; (iii) interviewing\nADB staff to explore their collective experience with processing and implementing RETAs;\n(iv) conducting case studies of RETA performance results in selected countries and/or sectors;\n(v) assessing the quality of RETA outputs; and (vi) drawing practical recommendations for future\ndirections and enhancements to the RETA process.\n21. Special  Evaluation  Study:  Project  Performance  Management  in  ADB  and  the\nDMCs. ADB has recently increased its emphasis on improving project quality and development\neffectiveness by improving both project quality at entry and more effective ongoing project\nperformance management. Internally, ADB has progressively introduced the PPMS, a results-\nbased design, monitoring, and evaluation system that emphasizes the identification of project\nperformance  indicators  at  the  design  stage  (the  logical  framework  is  a  requirement),  and\nongoing monitoring and evaluation of these indicators during project implementation. At the\nsame time, ADB has helped several DMCs establish their own results monitoring and evaluation\n(RME)  systems.  The  PPMS  is  not  yet  being  effectively  implemented  within  ADB,  and\nmodifications are currently being made to the system (for example, the project performance\nreport, which is used to report on project progress, is being redesigned). The study will assess\nprogress in implementing the PPMS and determine what modifications and/or interventions are\nneeded. This could include proposals for integrated training in all aspects of the PPMS, and\ndevelopment of training manuals, guidelines, and other assistance materials.\n22. The study will evaluate progress to date in implementing the PPMS within ADB and\nrelated  RME  TAs  in  the  DMCs,  most  of  which  are  ongoing  or  just  completed,  to  assess\ncapabilities within ADB and concerned planning agencies for implementing the PPMS and RME.", "6\nIn addition, the study will assess capabilities within associated key project executing agencies\n(for example, agriculture, public works, education, health), some of which have received TA\nsupport for project implementation. The study will cover the DMCs where ADB has provided TA\nfor capacity building in evaluation and/or RME (Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of China, Nepal,\nPhilippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) together with Cambodia and/or Viet Nam where significant\nassistance has also been provided for project monitoring. Apart from the desk review within\nADB,  field  visits  will  be  made  to  Bangladesh,  Nepal,  Sri  Lanka,  Thailand,  and\nCambodia/Viet Nam.  The  desk  review  of  the  TA  will  help  determine  which  executing  and\nplanning agencies will be selected.\n23. Special Evaluation Study Covering Projects Approved Under ADF V to VII. ADB\nprovides concessional finance through the ADF, which has a long-term vision of eliminating\nabsolute poverty in the poorest countries in Asia. At the time of negotiations on ADF VIII,6 the\ndonors asked that ADF effectiveness be evaluated. The proposed special study aims to fulfill\nthis request by evaluating selected projects approved under ADF V to VII. This will supplement\nOEO\u2019s recently completed study on ADF I to IV which provided indications as to the extent that\nthe ADF facility has improved the lives of the people in the borrower DMCs specifically along\nADB\u2019s strategic development objectives. Findings from this study indicate that ADF I to IV had\nsignificant impact over 13 out of 22 DMCs and that impacts would probably be greater if the\nstrategic  objectives,  allocation  criteria,  and  monitoring  and  control  system  of  overall\nperformance were in place at both ADB and country levels.\n24. The proposed evaluation study will be undertaken in two parts. Part I will assess the\noverall development impact of the finance provided through ADF V and Part II will assess\nprojects financed under ADF VI and VII. Part I will be completed in 2001 while Part II will be\ncompleted in 2002. The evaluation will consider both the direct and indirect impact of ADF\nresource transfers to these countries in assets creation and in bringing about policy reforms,\ncapacity building, and institutional development. The study will also identify best practices and\nlessons for the future to make future ADF operations more effective. The evaluation will adopt a\nprocess approach and not be limited to evaluation of inputs or outputs. The study will use a\ncombination of macroeconomic analysis, evaluation of selected case studies, desk studies, and\nimpact evaluation at country levels. The study is to use a participatory approach for evaluation\nand hold extensive stakeholder consultations in the DMCs involving the entire development\ncommunity.\n25. Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Bangladesh. As one of the poorest\ncountries in the world with a per capita income of approximately $337 in 1998, reducing poverty\nremains the central development challenge in Bangladesh. The high population density, poor\nresource management, and numerous natural disasters coupled with frequent political turmoil\nhave  constrained  the  economic  and  social  development  of  the  country  over  the  past  two\ndecades. Economic growth has remained low and poverty is endemic among both rural and\nurban households. Compared with its operations in the 1970s and 1980s, ADB\u2019s assistance to\nBangladesh in the 1990s has been more relevant to the strategic objective of poverty reduction\nand more effective in terms of project implementation. More emphasis has been placed on\nstructural  reforms,  capacity  building,  and  institutional  development.  Partnerships  with  the\nGovernment, nongovernment organizations, and civil society have also been strengthened. With\nthis, Bangladesh has made significant progress in improving social conditions, particularly in the\nfields of health, education, and population. At the same time, it has achieved a certain degree of\nmacroeconomic stability. The study aims to assess more closely the impact and development\n                                                \n6 Seventh replenishment of the ADF.", "7\neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s country-wide activities including new lending services, i.e., economic\nsector work, policy dialogue, and aid coordination.\n26. Specifically, the CAPE will (i) evaluate ADB\u2019s strategy for developmental assistance to\nBangladesh and the relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of its overall program assistance;\n(ii) derive lessons learned; and (iii) provide recommendations to feed into the design of ADB\u2019s\ncountry strategy. Although the CAPE will evaluate past operations, it will provide useful lessons\nand directions for the future. The CAPE will focus on issues that are relevant for decision\nmaking by ADB and the Government of Bangladesh. The evaluation of the assistance program\nfor  Bangladesh  is  proposed  to  comprise  the  following:  (i)  a  review  of  Bangladesh\u2019s\nmacroeconomic environment development plans, development contribution of other assistance\nagencies  in  Bangladesh,  and  ADB\u2019s  diagnosis  of  the  country\u2019s  development  needs  and\nproblems; (ii) assessment of ADB\u2019s assistance strategies to Bangladesh and of the relevance\nand appropriateness of its operational strategies and interventions; (iii) evaluation of ADB\u2019s\noperations (both lending and nonlending), and determination of the efficiency and efficacy of its\noperational programs; (iv) assessment of the implication of the current changing environment\nfacing Bangladesh; and (v) identification of new opportunities and responsibilities, issues, and\nlessons learned for future consideration in the preparation and implementation of the country\nassistance plan. Based on OEO\u2019s experience in the CAPE for the Philippines, this study is\nexpected to be completed in 2002.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n27. The RETA is estimated to cost $1.6 million. It will be financed by ADB on a grant basis\nfrom the ADB-funded TA program. Cost estimates are given in Appendix 4.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n28. OEO will implement the RETA. Eight OEO staff will independently carry out the studies,\nwith the assistance of international and domestic consultants. ADB staff will provide a total of\nabout  30  person-months  of  OEO\u2019s  own  human  resources.  About  55  person-months  of\ninternational consulting and about 150 person-months of domestic consulting inputs are funded\nunder this RETA. The individual areas of expertise, duration of engagements of consultants,\nand outline terms of reference are given in Appendix 5. In keeping with OEO\u2019s guidelines for\npreparing evaluation reports, each OEO staff member involved will prepare a position paper\nprior to engaging consultants and embarking on evaluation missions. Operational departments\nand DMC governments will be fully consulted prior to formulating the study design matrix and\nfinalizing detailed terms of reference for consultant recruitment. Individual evaluation reports will\nbe prepared for each study. Consultants will be engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic\nconsultant. The RETA will commence in February 2000 and is expected to be completed by\nmid-2002.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION\n29. The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical\nassistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $1,600,000 for the\npurpose of Impact and Special Evaluation Studies of Asian Development Bank Operations in\nDeveloping Member Countries.", "8\nAppendix 1, page 1\nMAJOR OPERATIONS EVALUATION ACTIVITIES IN 2001\nA.
