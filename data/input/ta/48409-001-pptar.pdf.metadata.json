Justification \n1.  A project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) is required to conduct technical, financial \nand  economic  feasibility  and  due  diligence  of  critical  agribusiness  investments  and  prepare \nrelevant documents for approval of funding. The climate-friendly agribusiness value chains sector \nproject is included in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Regional Investment Framework (RIF) \nfor agriculture (2012\u20132022), and is prioritized in the RIF implementation plan for 2014\u20132018, which \nwas endorsed by the GMS summit in December 2014. The three participating governments \u2013 \nCambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar \u2013 will contribute to the PPTA in terms of staff and in-kind \nresources but do not have the capacity to prepare an investment project that will adhere to the \ngovernments\u2019 and ADB\u2019s requirements. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The main  outputs  of the  PPTA  will  include  detailed  reports  on feasibility  assessment, \nincluding technical, economic and financial due diligence, of priority agribusiness value chains in \nCLM countries. The PPTA will produce an agreed project design in relation to the four outputs of \nthe investment project (agribusiness value chain infrastructure, bio-energy use and sustainable \nbiomass  management,  agribusiness  policy  and  capacity  support  services,  and  project \nimplementation and knowledge management) with implementation arrangements suitable for each \ncountry. The PPTA will prioritize subprojects based on needs, circumstances and capacities of \neach country (Supplementary Document 1) and conduct a detailed assessment of policy-related, \nregulatory, institutional, technical, financial and other barriers for improving the competitiveness of \nselected value chains (one bulk commodity such as rice in all countries, and one or two high value \ncommodities such as spices, fruits) in priority regions. It will identify measures to overcome such \nbarriers, including identification of incentives to promote public-private partnerships (PPPs) and \nprivate sector investments.  The PPTA will define the scope and cost of investments, subproject \nlocations  and  activities,  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  procurement  strategy, \ntechnology  issues,  capacity  development  needs,  and  post-project  operation  and  maintenance \narrangements of the project. PPTA will carefully examine potential adverse impacts of investments \nin rural infrastructure on small markets and suggest countermeasures. Lessons learned from the \nroads  to  markets  project  in  Cambodia,  Sustainable  Natural  Resource  Management  and \nProductivity Enhancement Project in Lao PDR and other projects will be integrated in designing the \ninvestment  project.  The  PPTA  will  build  on  vulnerability  assessments,  climate  risk  financing \nassessments,  green  value  chain  assessments  and  other  pilots,  including  results-based \ndisbursement models being conducted through Phase 2 of GMS Core Agriculture Support Program \nand the GMS Core Environment Program.  \n \n3.  Specific TA activities will include: (i) detailed scoping and assessments of demand and \nopportunities for public and private investments to support agribusiness development, including \ndifferentiation of roles of public and private sectors in management, operation and maintenance of \ninfrastructure  investments  under  output  1,  (ii)  assessment  of  institutional  capacities,  human \nresources development needs, monitoring mechanisms and implementation arrangements for the \nproposed interventions, especially at the provincial level, (iii) meaningful stakeholder engagement \ninitiatives and focus group discussions with civil society organizations, national and sub-national \ngovernments, private sector and local communities, (iv) baseline data collection for all indicators \nidentified in the design and monitoring framework, (v) identification of specific areas to direct \nsupport  and  consult  with  organizations  currently  working  in  those  areas  to  assess  feasible \npartnership arrangements, (vi) due diligence assessments (technical, economic, social safeguards \n[involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples\u2019 impacts], environmental, risk, etc.) for project \nfinancing proposal and any necessary surveys, consultation and refinement for development of ", "2 \n \nimplementation plan, to provide options for procuring and managing the contracts, (vii) preparation \nof project procurement risk assessment and management plan, procurement capacity building plan, \ndraft procurement plan, and master bidding documents for different types of contracts, including a \nrequest for proposal for selection of implementation consultant, and (viii) preparation of necessary \ndocuments  for  approval  of  grant  funding/  cofinancing,  where  appropriate.  The  social  and \nenvironmental specialists will prepare reports on poverty and social assessment, environmental \nassessment,  social  safeguard  frameworks  (and  plans,  if  needed),  stakeholder  communication \nstrategy,  and  consultation  and  participation  plan  for  local  community  engagement  to  ensure \nbeneficiaries leverage full impact of the project\u2019s activities. The basic approach is to identify a few \ncore subprojects based on established criteria (e.g., contribution to food security, energy security, \nwater  security,  environmental  sustainability,  positive  social  impacts)  and  through  stakeholder \nconsultations.  \n \n4.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n \n5.  The TA estimated to cost $2.5 million equivalent, to be financed on a grant basis for   $1.5 \nmillion from the Asia Clean Energy Fund (ACEF)1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility and $1.0 million from the Canadian Climate Fund for Private Sector in Asia under the Clean \nEnergy Financing Partnership Facility. Both funds are administered by ADB and are used through \nparallel  financing  arrangement.  The  Government  of  Cambodia,  the  Government  of  the  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic and the Government of Myanmar each will provide support in the \nform of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions.
