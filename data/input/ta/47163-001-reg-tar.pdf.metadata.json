This  regional  research  and  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  requested  by \nnational rice research institutions following the successful completion of the regional TA for the  \nDevelopment and Dissemination of Water-Saving Rice Technologies in South Asia,1 primarily to \nimplement large-scale dissemination of promising breeding lines developed under the same TA \nand to continue developing breeding lines tolerant to water stress. The present TA will cover \nwater-short and seasonally water-scarce countries in South Asia (Bangladesh, India, and Nepal), \nwith extension to Southeast Asia (Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic) given \nsimilar  problems  in  this  region,  through  further  adaptation  research,  variety  trials,  and \nknowledge  transfer  of  the  technologies  developed  under  the  earlier  TA.  Respective \ngovernments concur with the present TA\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, cost, implementation and \nfinancing arrangements, and terms of reference.2 The TA is consistent with the medium-term \ncorporate strategic priorities for research of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on (i) mitigating \nclimate change, (ii) responding to increasing commodity prices, and (iii) promoting inclusive \ngrowth.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In Asia and the Pacific, 90% of the total diverted freshwater is used to irrigate agriculture, \nand more than 50% of this is used to irrigate rice. The growing scarcity of water worldwide has \nstarted to influence conventional irrigated rice production. By 2025, physical water scarcity will \naffect an estimated 15 million hectares.4 Climate change estimates predict the irrigation water \ndeficit  and  the  intensity  and  frequency  of  water  shortage  to  deteriorate  further.  The \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that about 1.2 billion people could face \nfreshwater shortages by 2020 and that crop yields in some parts of the region could drop by as \nmuch as 30% by 2050.5 This will impact both irrigated and rain-fed agriculture. The interannual \nrainfall variability, including the concentration of rain over fewer days in a year and in different \nlocations, will further impair surface irrigation systems. Droughts as a result of water shortage \nwill occur with new and varied intensities.  \n \n3.  The increasing water scarcity highlights the need to improve the water productivity of \nrice  and  to  reduce  its  susceptibility  to  water  stress  to  ensure  adequate  food  for  future \ngenerations. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), through its research on water-\nsaving technologies, developed the alternate wetting and drying (AWD) technology for high-\nyielding transplanted rice. Testing at IRRI and field experience in Bangladesh and India have \nshown that the AWD system leads to savings of at least 15%\u201320% water compared with \ntransplanted  flooded  rice,  without  any  decline  in  yields.  Technologies  that  require  further \ndevelopment include aerobic rice as a prominent water-saving technology for moderate yield \ncapacity, direct-seeded situations, and new varieties that are more tolerant of water-stress \nevents. Aerobic rice trials using direct seeding have demonstrated water savings of 30%\u201335%. \nIn addition, aerobic rice is a labor-saving technology, and can also be carried more efficiently \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

The frequency of water-stress events during the rice-\ngrowing period are becoming more common, and varieties that suffer less yield loss from these \nevents need to be further developed. \n \n4.  From  January  2006  to  August  2010,  ADB  supported  TA  for  the  Development  and \nDissemination of Water-Saving Rice Technologies in South Asia. In collaboration with IRRI and \nnational  rice  research  organizations  in  Bangladesh,  India,  Nepal,  and  Pakistan,  that  TA  \n(i) disseminated two principal water-saving rice technologies\u2014AWD and aerobic production\u2014 \nfrom IRRI to participating countries, (ii) developed new generation of rice varieties suitable for \nthese water-saving technologies, (iii) disseminated promising breeding lines to national systems \nthrough participatory varietal selection processes, and (iv) identified cropping patterns and weed \ncontrol measures for sustainable rice production in aerobic situation. Lessons learned include \nthe need to (i) increase resources for expanded variety trials in participating countries, and \n(ii) continue the developmental work. The present TA responds to both issues. \n \n5.  Government rice research agencies evaluated the breeding lines with the participation of \nlocal farmers in each country. Both AWD and aerobic technologies have generated positive \nresults in farmers\u2019 fields\u2014the identified breeding lines yield 10%\u201330% more despite less water. \nTherefore, the governments have requested ADB support for large-scale seed multiplication; \nevaluation and dissemination of second-generation, climate-adapted water-saving rice varieties; \nand development and initial dissemination of new, third-generation aerobic and AWD varieties, \nas well as impact assessments.6 These activities are essential to achieving food security in the \nface of climate-change-induced water shortage in rice production areas. \n \n6.  The TA aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020, where the environment and climate change are \na core area of operation. 7 The TA is consistent with climate change impact on water and food \nsecurity;  knowledge  solutions;  and  inclusive,  environmentally  sustainable  development,  as \nprioritized in the country partnership strategies for each participating country. The TA is also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Sustainable Food Security in Asia and the Pacific, \nwhich calls for broader support of agriculture research, and contributes to two key pillars of the \noperational plan\u2014enhancing agriculture productivity and improving resilience to climate change \nand  price  volatility8\u2014and  to  the  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020,  which  emphasizes \nexpanding  and  deepening  knowledge  and  dissemination  of  technology  advances,  and \nminimizing footprints through supporting water saving and conservation measures.9 \n \n7.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  can  be  leveraged  for  inclusion  in  food-security-related \ninvestment projects. Adoption of water-saving rice varieties can be a project component of an \ninvestment project on food security, which often requires comprehensive measures in dealing \n                                                 \n6  The first-generation varieties were developed by crossing lowland varieties with upland varieties, combining high \nyield potential of lowland lines with weed competitiveness, drought tolerance of upland lines, and resistance \nagainst blast and bacterial leaf blight. The first-generation varieties lack improvements in grain quality. The second-\ngeneration  varieties  developed  in  the  TA  for  the  Development  and  Dissemination  of  Water-Saving  Rice \nTechnologies in South Asia add into the first generation with medium-slender grain and good grain quality traits. \nHowever, the second-generation varieties lack tolerance to nematodes with reduced nutrient uptake. The third- \ngeneration aerobic rice varieties will combine the second generation with increased nutrient uptake under an \naerobic situation, and tolerance to nematodes. By incorporating increased nutrient uptake and nematode tolerance \nunder an aerobic situation through a marker-assisted breeding approach, the third-generation varieties shall show \ngreater yield and better adaptation to aerobic situations than second-generation varieties. \n7  ADB. 2008.

Capacity development and effective adoption \nof rice varieties with private sector involvement, and establishing institutional infrastructure to \nfacilitate  take-up  are  also  potential  follow-up  investment  opportunities  to  sustain  the \ndevelopment and dissemination of climate-adapted rice varieties. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA impact will be sustainable rice production with climate-resilient varieties in South \nAsia and Southeast Asia. The TA outcome will be increased rice yield and water efficiency in \nwater-short irrigated and drought-prone rain-fed areas.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The outputs of the TA will be: (i) high-yielding rice varieties suitable for water-short \nclimates developed and disseminated; and (ii) site-specific crop management packages for \naerobic cultivation in water-short areas developed and disseminated. \n \n10.  For output 1, the TA will multiply the second-generation, water-saving varieties (two \naerobic and two AWD) identified in the TA for the Development and Dissemination of Water-\nSaving Rice Technologies in South Asia, distribute seeds to 5,000 farmers in each country, and \nadvise farmers in each country on how to grow and cultivate the climate-adapted aerobic and \nAWD varieties. The TA will further develop third-generation, nematode-resistant and water-\nsaving  varieties  by  crossing  nematode-tolerant  lines  with  a  high-yield  line,  and  high-yield \naerobic rice with a high-yield lowland line grown in shallow lowland ecosystems. The breeding \nlines will be shared with participating countries and in the second year will be evaluated in yield \ntrials. Promising lines from advanced yield trials will be nominated to national trials for release \nas new varieties.  \n \n11.  For output 2, the TA will develop and disseminate site-specific fertilizer, weed, water, \nand soil management and mechanization techniques. Site-specific management systems with \nhigh and moderate nutrient input will be determined. Soil health and soil nutritional status under \naerobic and AWD systems will be analyzed for each site. Suitable crop rotations for the aerobic \nsystem will be evaluated from long-term experiments. \n \n12.  The TA will involve both basic research at IRRI and adaptive research in collaborating \nnational agricultural research centers and in farmers\u2019 fields. Participatory approaches will be \nused in validating and disseminating suitable technologies. In each participating country, the \ntargeted breeder seed production of the improved varieties will be carried out at the participating \ninstitutions. For the production and distribution of certified seed to farmers, the TA, through the \nparticipating institution in each country, will link with seed-producing public and private agencies \nand nongovernment organizations to produce the target 1,000 tons of quality seed. \n \n13.  Knowledge sharing and capacity building are integral parts of the two outputs. IRRI and \nthe participating national institutes will disseminate knowledge and techniques via (i) climate-\nadapted varieties and management practice packages to about 5,000 farmers in water-short \nsites in each of the five participating countries; (ii) a book on recent advances in water-saving \nrice technologies; (iii) a manual, with translation to local languages, of practices for water-saving \ntechnologies based on the selected AWD and aerobic varieties; and (iv) publication of at least \ntwo scientific papers in refereed journals. Two research assistants at PhD candidate level, one \n ", "4    \neach from South Asia and Southeast Asia participating countries, will be advised by IRRI to \nconduct research on how to further improve yields under aerobic water-saving conditions and \ndevelop third-generation aerobic rice varieties. In addition, a series of training courses on the \ndevelopment and use of water-saving technologies for rice production will be organized among \nnational scientists and extension workers. \n \n14.  The TA has a low risk profile, with demonstrated success built on the achievements of \nthe ADB-funded TA for the Development and Dissemination of Water-Saving Rice Technologies \nin South Asia. IRRI, the proposed research institute to be hired as a firm, has world-class \nresearch facilities and capacity, and a long record of collaboration with the cooperating country \nresearch institutions responsible for in-country varietal assessments and seed multiplication. \nMultiple testing sites in each country will mitigate the potential risk that wet seasons may \nprevent water-shortage-adaptable traits from being exhibited. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,370,000, of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Climate Change Fund;10 and (ii) $620,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of Finland, to be administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 3 years (January 2014\u2013December 2016). ADB will be \nthe executing agency.  \n \n17.  The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), \nand consultants will be recruited in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The  TA  requires  121.2  person-months  of  international  consulting  and  120  person-\nmonths of national consulting services. The consultant team will comprise (i) an international \nsenior scientist to act as team leader; (ii) an international rice breeder to help manage the \nbreeding and screening program; (iii) two international plant breeders to assist country-specific \nseed multiplication, dissemination, varietal evaluation and survey, and impact assessment; and \n(iv) two international research assistants who are PhD students; and (v) five national research \ntechnicians. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  ADB will engage IRRI to provide the consulting services using single-source selection. \nThis is justified because (i) IRRI has a long track record as an internationally recognized \ninstitute for rice-related research, training, and knowledge transfer and for developing new rice \nvarieties and rice crop management techniques that help rice farmers improve the yield and \nquality of their rice in an environmentally sustainable way; (ii) the TA is a follow-on to the TA for \nthe Development and Dissemination of Water-Saving Rice Technologies in South Asia under \nwhich IRRI has successfully made scientific progress and developed intellectual knowledge that \nis  publicly  available;  and  (iii)  as  an  international  center  of  excellence  on  rice,  IRRI  has \nexceptional worth and is the only one qualified with experience for the assignment. IRRI will \n                                                 \n10  Established by ADB. \n ", "  5\nenter into subcontracts with collaborating national research centers for in-country research, \ndemonstration, dissemination, and training. The value of ADB's contract with IRRI is $1,370,000. \nIRRI will be paid on a milestone payment basis. \n \n20.  IRRI will hold an inception workshop within 2 months of the notice to proceed to provide \na detailed work plan and milestones for each output. IRRI will submit the following reports to \nADB: (i) an inception report within 3 months of mobilization; (ii) semiannual progress reports; \n(iii) a draft final report by October 2016; and (iv) a final report acceptable to ADB by December \n2016. For output 2, IRRI will also need to (i) compile, publish, and disseminate a book on latest \nadvances  in  water-saving  rice  technologies  by  December  2014;  and  (ii)  produce  and \ndisseminate  a  manual  for  site-specific  fertilizer,  weed,  and  water  management  and \nmechanization techniques by December 2014. \n \n21.  IRRI will provide office accommodation, transport, and other support services in the \nPhilippines. Collaborating institutions in each of the participating countries will provide office \naccommodation  and  facilities,  field  facilities  for  seed  multiplication  and  dissemination,  and \nnecessary facilities, room and equipment for training, and technology dissemination. \n \n22.  The TA will ensure availability of climate-adapted rice varieties through collaboration with \nnational and provincial seed multiplication agencies, public and private sector institutes, and \nnongovernment  organizations  for  large-scale  seed  production  and  distribution.  Varieties \ndeveloped under the TA shall be available for cultivation to all farmers in beneficiary countries \nand can be shared with different research institutions in different countries after the signing of \nthe IRRI standard material transfer agreement. \n \n23.  Monitoring and evaluation are integral to the design and implementation plan of the TA. \nA TA monitoring system will be established with baseline data by country and production system. \nParameters including water saving,11 yield, pest and disease tolerance, fertilizer efficiency, and \nfarmer and consumer preference will be evaluated under scientific analysis as well as through \nfarmer participative evaluation of on-field trials. Impact analysis and a TA completion report will \nbe prepared in the final year of the TA. 12 \n \n24.  Good practices and lessons learned will be prepared and disseminated and, along with \nthe new technology and varieties, will be a major contribution to the regional knowledge bank of \nADB, IRRI, and the country research institutions. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $620,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis, for the Development and Dissemination \nof Climate-Resilient Rice Varieties for Water-Short Areas of South Asia and Southeast Asia, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n11  Scientists will measure the amount of water received by each experiment through rainfall by rain gauge, and \nadditional water provided through irrigation by water meter, at the mouth of the field from beginning of sowing of \neach experiment under conventional transplanting, AWD, and aerobic situations to quantify the amount of water \nsaving achieved in AWD and aerobic rice as compared to water provided in the conventional system. \n12 A pooled regression-based approach on data collected from adopting and nonadopting farmers can be used to \nevaluate the benefits of the TA. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption\nSustainable rice  By 2020, 10% of farmers in each target  Records and reports from  Participating country \nproduction with  country have adopted varietal and  water and agriculture  governments release \nclimate-resilient  production technologies developed and  ministries in each  varieties in a timely \nvarieties in South  promoted under the TA (baseline: 1 - 2%  participating country  manner and target \nAsia and Southeast  in 2013)  likely water-scarce \nAsia  areas. \n \nRisk \nDissemination is \nrestricted by political \ninstability in rice \nareas prone to water \nshortage. \nOutcome      Risk \nIncreased rice yield  Average rice yield in the participating  Records from agricultural  Wet seasons prevent \nand water efficiency  countries increased by 10% by 2016  ministry in each  water-shortage-\nin water-short  (baseline: 6.0-6.5 tons/hectare in AWD  participating country  adaptable traits from \nirrigated and  and 5.0 tons/hectare under aerobic    being exhibited \ndrought-prone rain- production in 2013)   \nfed areas     \nAverage water use reduced by 10%  Records from agricultural \nunder AWD and 20% under aerobic  ministry in each \nproduction by 2016 (baseline: 1,200- participating country \n1,500 millimeters in 2013) \nOutputs      Assumptions\n1.
