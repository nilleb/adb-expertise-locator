Project preparatory technical assistance (TA) is necessary to effectively formulate the \nCapital Market Development Program, which will support the government\u2019s commitment to \nmeaningful capital market reform. The objective of the TA is to identify policy measures to \nsupport the development of a robust financial market system in Sri Lanka that is well balanced, \nsustainable, and resilient; and which is able to effectively intermediate savings so as to finance \ninvestment.    \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The TA will build upon the 10-point agenda (Appendix 5) that was established by the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Stock Exchange \n(CSE). To develop the bond market, the TA experts will also draw on results of work previously \nundertaken by the SEC and CSE to assess Sri Lanka\u2019s capital market. The TA will engage \ninternational and domestic consultants, who will  work closely with the government, market \nparticipants, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the five areas below: \n \n(i)  Improvements  to  legal  and  regulatory  structures.  The  TA  will  assist  the \ngovernment  in  further  developing  a  legal  and  financial  supervisory  policy \nstructure that strikes the right balance in financial regulation and enhances the \nstability of Sri Lanka\u2019s financial system. The TA will help develop measures to \nremove inherent conflicts of interest, and enhance liquidity and public trust. The \nTA  will  focus  on  options  for  legal  and  regulatory  reforms  and  benchmark \nregulatory efforts against international standards. It will analyze structural and \ninstitutional issues, such as the limited autonomy of the SEC and the Insurance \nBoard of Sri Lanka (IBSL), and recommend measures to solve or minimize them. \nThe  feasibility  of  investing  in  an  information  and  communication  technology \nsystem to enhance regulatory and enforcement capacities (such as real-time \nsurveillance) at the SEC and IBSL will also be assessed. To complement the \nenhanced surveillance system, the TA will assess and guide the establishment of \na  capital  market  tribunal.  It  will  review  legislation  related  to  accounting  and \nauditing  standards,  and  recommend  measures  to  strengthen  the  Sri  Lanka \nAccounting  and  Auditing  Standards  Monitoring  Board.  The  creation  and \nintroduction of a Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Board on the CSE \nwill also be examined. The CSE listing requirements and registration fees for \ncompanies (including for developing the SME Board) will be assessed. The TA \nwill also facilitate the CSE demutualization process by introducing best practices \nin its governance structure, which would include drafting the required legislative \nand procedural frameworks. \n \n(ii)  Bond market development. The second output will focus on measures that will \nlead to the extension of the government yield curve and thus to further corporate \nbond market development. The TA will analyze impediments to the development \nof a liquid debt market and recommend a strategy that will foster a deep, liquid, \nand transparent debt market offering a wide range of products. On the supply \nside, emphasis will be placed on increasing the supply of high-quality corporate \npaper by building on the benchmark yield curve of Government of Sri Lanka \ntradable securities and thereby improving the functioning and efficiency of the \nfixed-income market. The output will also identify measures to enable the repo \n ", " \nmarket and, in particular, the trading of repos. The development of a market \nfacilitator  through  a  liquidity  facility  will  be  examined  to  reduce  the  liquidity \npremium that hinders secondary trading. The TA will review the primary dealer \nsystem  and  focus  on  developing  competitive  pricing  of  primary  issuances, \nincluding  promoting  the  role  of  credit  rating  agencies  and  the  use  of  credit \nenhancement products or risk mitigation instruments. The TA will also review the \nestablishment of a bond clearing house for transactions in government securities, \nwhich could be extended to other instruments such as corporate debt securities, \nknown as debt exchanges. An assessment of the merits of integrated versus \nseparate  e-trading  platforms  for  government  and  corporate  bonds  will  be \nundertaken. On the demand side, initiatives to increase the demand for corporate \nsecurities will be assessed, e.g., through contractual savings institutions (such as \npromoting  the  establishment  of  pension  and  provident  fund  management \ncompanies and enhancing their participation in capital markets). On the supply \nside, initiatives to increase the supply for corporate securities will be assessed \n(e.g., waiver of any double-taxation measures or nuisance taxes). The output will \nalso examine nontraditional bond markets (e.g., Thai baht, Indian rupee, Chinese \nyuan) and sukuks for sovereign bond issuance purposes. Regional experiences \nin developing resilient, liquid bond markets will be considered while formulating \nthe strategy. The role of mutual funds (including unit trusts) in promoting capital \nmarket  development  and  bond  market  development  will  be  explored.  The \nintroduction  of real  estate  investment trusts  (REITs),  securitization  structures \n(which  include  support  for  drafting  the  securitization  act),  covered  bonds, \nmunicipal bonds, and infrastructure bonds will also be assessed. \n \n(iii)  Development of financial-instrument tax policies. The third output will focus \non a systematic analysis of the tax structure for financial instruments. It will \nrecommend measures that are compatible with financial market development\u2014\nand  that  also  do  not  violate  tax  principles\u2014to  remove  distortions  between \ndifferent types of financial assets, such as elimination of the share transaction \nlevy. Tax incentives to attract foreign companies to be listed on the CSE will also \nbe examined. The potential impacts of a tax-neutral structure will be assessed, \nand the likely benefits of such a structure will be weighed against the likely costs. \nThis will be substantiated by an analysis of successful financial-instrument tax \npolicies elsewhere in the region. A sequenced action plan will be developed that \nis compatible with financial market development.  \n \n(iv)  Enabling environment for derivatives (including commodities). The fourth \noutput will focus on establishing a commodities exchange (i.e., a feasibility study \nto  assess  and  guide  its  establishment,  including  implementation,  rules  and \nregulations,  and  legislation  needed)  as  well  as  developing  a  regulatory \nframework  for  trading  in  derivatives.  In  addition  to  building  critical  market \ninfrastructure, the output will also focus on developing bond futures, interest rate \nderivatives, exchange rate derivatives, and equity derivatives. \n \n(v)  Development of insurance and pension industries. The fifth output will focus \non measures to strengthen the insurance and pension industries. These will be \nsequenced with actions to ensure active investment and participation of these \nindustries in the capital market.  \n \n \n ", " \n3.
