INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2007  Country  Programming  Midterm  Review  Mission  to  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), the Government confirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) \nfor  the  preparation  of  the  Western  Yunnan  Roads  Development  II  Project. 1  An  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission in June 2007 visited the PRC; traveled to the \nproject  area;  carried  out  an  initial  poverty  and  social  assessment  (IPSA)  and  a  rapid \nenvironmental assessment (REA), and held consultation meetings; and discussed economic and \nsocial development, and project-specific issues with government officials and other stakeholders. \nThis report is based on the agreement reached with the Government during the mission, on the \nobjective, scope, costs, financing, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the \nTA, and the mission\u2019s observations in the field. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The PRC\u2019s rapid economic growth since the 1980s has substantially increased the \ndemand for transport services. As the economy has changed in structure and become more \ndiversified, the pattern of transport demand has changed. Demand for road transport, a mode of \ntransport that is more flexible and responsive to the needs of a market economy, has outpaced \nthat for other modes. The shift in transport demand also reflects the loosening of anticompetitive \nrestrictions in the road transport industry itself. From 1990 to 2005, passenger traffic by road \ngrew by 8.8% yearly, to 929.9 billion passenger-kilometers (km), and freight traffic by road grew \nby 6.4% yearly, to 857.4 billion ton-km. In Yunnan, road traffic during the same period grew by \n8.8% a year for passenger traffic, to 23.3 billion passenger-km, and by 5.7% a year for freight, \nto 38.2 billion ton-km. In 2005, road traffic accounted for 53.0% of the country\u2019s total passenger \ntraffic and 11.0% of the total freight traffic. The vehicle fleet will continue to expand with the \ncountry\u2019s rapid economic growth, low vehicle ownership rates, increasing access to loans to \nfinance automobile purchases, and large investment in automotive manufacturing. By 2005, \ntotal vehicle ownership in the PRC was 43.3 million (20.6% higher than in 2004); of this total, \n23.7 million vehicles were privately owned (22.0% more than a year earlier). Total vehicle \nownership in Yunnan increased by 75.3% from 2000 to 2005, from 586,700 to 1,036,100. \n \n3.  To meet the growing demand for improved transport infrastructure and services, the \nGovernment spent more than CNY1,900 billion on new roads during the 10th Five-Year Plan \nperiod (2001\u20132005). By the end of 2005, the PRC had 1.92 million km of roads, about 17% of \nthese are class II roads or better. Road network density, however, was still low, at 20.0 km per \n100 square kilometers\u2014only one third of Brazil\u2019s and a quarter of India\u2019s. The Government\u2019s \npolicy for the road sector, as reflected in its 11th Five-Year Plan (2006\u20132010), calls for (i) the \nconstruction of 380,000 km of roads to increase the total road network to 2.3 million km, \nincluding 25,000 km of expressways;2 (ii) the completion of the national trunk highway system \nby 2007; (iii) the completion of the interprovincial western development corridors by 2010; and \n(iv) the completion of 65\u201370% of the national expressway network, for a total length of 55,000\u2013\n60,000 km, by 2010. \n \n4.  While the national trunk highway system is being developed, most of rural PRC is hard \nto reach. Many townships and villages still depend on earth tracks that are almost impassable to \nmotorized traffic, particularly during the rainy season. Even where all-weather roads have been \nbuilt, rural roads are of low standard and poorly maintained, and many are in serious need of \nrepair. Each year since 2003, the Government has invested about CNY20 billion in rural road \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 April 2007. \n2  The PRC had 45,400 km of expressways in 2006, second only to the United States. \n ", "2   \ndevelopment, building about 50,000 km and upgrading 150,000 km. By the end of 2005, the \nGovernment had built 494,276 km of county roads and 981,430 km of township roads. About \n99.8%  townships  and 94.3%  villages  were  connected  by  all-weather  roads, and  81.1% of \ntownships and 55.5% of villages by paved roads. According to the Rural Road Development \nPlan, the Government will invest CNY800 billion in rural roads during the 11th Five-Year Plan \nperiod (2006\u20132010). As planned, all townships and villages in the PRC will be connected by \nall-weather roads, and 90% of townships and 80% of villages by paved roads. Paved roads will \nlink all townships and villages in the eastern region, all townships and 88% of villages in the \ncentral region, and 90% of townships and 50% of villages in the western region. \n \n5.  During the 10th Five-Year Plan period (2001\u20132005), road investments totaled CNY1,978 \nbillion, or CNY396 billion per year, and grew by about 20 times annually\u2014more than double the \nrate in the previous 5 years. The Yunnan Provincial Communications Department (YPCD) \ninvested about CNY15.1 billion in the road sector of the province in 2005, CNY12.1 billion of this \nin construction and CNY1.5 billion in maintenance. During the 10th Five-Year Plan period, the \nYPCD invested about CNY71 billion. An increase to CNY78 billion is planned for 2006\u20132010. \nGiven the limited public financing, YPCD needs to explore alternative financing from private \nsources (e.g., asset-backed securitization) to meet the investment requirements. \n \n6.  Yunnan is a landlocked province, with no direct access to ocean ports or international \ntrade routes except by long routes through other provinces or countries. The western part of the \nprovince is particularly disadvantaged by its distance from the provincial capital of Kunming. It is \nin the southwest of the PRC, and is bordered on the east by Guizhou Province and Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region and on the north by Sichuan Province. Yunnan is also part of the \nGreater Mekong Subregion (GMS), but is not connected with the other GMS countries by an \nexpressway link. Although relatively underdeveloped compared with eastern PRC, Yunnan has \ndeveloped faster than many of the other western provinces. In 1995\u20132000, gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew at 8.4% while per capita GDP grew at 7.1%. These rates slowed to 7.8% \nand 6.1%, respectively, in 2000\u20132003 but increased in 2004 and 2005 to more than 10% on the \naverage. However, per capita GDP, as well as average rural income, is still only about two \nthirds of the national average. Yunnan Province has a population of 44.2 million, with 26 \nminorities making up a third of the total. \n \n7.  The impact of road investments on poverty reduction is well documented in studies and \nevaluations of completed road projects financed by ADB3 and the World Bank.4 Integrated road \ndevelopment helps ensure that the transport cost and time savings, along with the increased \nincomes, are passed on through the transport chain to townships and villages and eventually \nreach the poor. These results affirm the relevance of ADB\u2019s strategy in the PRC road sector. A \ncase  study  in  Shaanxi  Province  found  that  improved  roads  were  correlated  with  poverty \nreduction, and that (i) for every CNY10,000 invested in roads, 3.2 poor people are lifted out of \npoverty; and (ii) for every 1% increase in kilometers of road per capita, household consumption \nincreases by 0.08%.5 Rural poor areas benefit from lower transport costs; lower cost of inputs; \nexpanded agricultural support services; improved farming practices; greater access to urban \njobs; and better access to health, education, and social services.6 \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2002.

Yunnan Province is strategically located on the PRC\u2019s southern border with the other GMS \ncountries to support regional cooperation and integration. The proposed project is part of the GMS \nNorthern Corridor connecting Fangcheng port in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Kunming, \nRuili (on the border with Myanmar), and Tamu (on the border between Myanmar and India), as \nprovided in ADB\u2019s GMS Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2007\u20132009) and \nthe GMS Transport Sector Strategy Study.7 To facilitate trade with the other GMS countries, an \nexpressway link is being developed between Kunming and Ruili, one of the three major inland \nports that serve as outlets for trade with the rest of the GMS. The Kunming\u2013Baoshan section is \nopen to traffic, while the Baoshan\u2013Longling section is being implemented under ADB financing. \nThe proposed project completes the missing link between Longling and Ruili, thus providing an \nimportant trade link with the other GMS countries. Ruili is a national land port, with a trade volume \nof  470,000  tons  in  2006,  valued  at  CNY3.2  billion,  and  the  potential  to  grow  in  the \nnot-too-distant future. To reduce nonphysical barriers to trade, ADB has been supporting the \nimplementation of the GMS Cross-Border Transport Agreement, which facilitates the movement \nof goods and people among the six GMS countries. The agreement was ratified by all six GMS \ngovernments by 2005, and is expected to be fully implemented by 2008. \n \n9.  The proposed project (see map) is the fifth road project in Yunnan to be financed by \nADB. The first two projects8 have been successfully completed, the third9 is being implemented \nsatisfactorily, and the fourth project is under preparation. The proposed project expressway, \nconnecting Longling and Ruili, is a 158 km access-controlled four-lane expressway with a \ndesigned speed of 80 km per hour. The expressway will be supported by associated local road \nupgrading and other complementary components. Class 2 and class 4 roads in the project area \nstretch 175 km and in 2005 carried a traffic volume of 4,295 passenger cars per day. Traffic on \nthis road is likely to reach capacity by 2010. Eastward, this project will link the western part of \nYunnan province with Kunming and then Shanghai (2,500 km in total) as one of the east\u2013west \nroutes of the national trunk highway system. Toward the west, the project will link with other \nGMS countries as the GMS Northern Corridor and eventually reach India. \n \n10.  The project area includes Longling County in Baoshan Prefecture and Dehong Dai and \nJingpo  Autonomous  Prefecture  in  the  western  part  of  Yunnan  Province.  The  area  has  a \npopulation of 1,443,000, of which 603,800 (41.8%) are rural poor and 596,500 (41.3%) are \nethnic minorities. The main ethnic minorities in the area are Dai, Jingpo, Lishu, De\u2019an, and \nA\u2019chang. Per capita GDP in 2006 varied between counties from CNY5,091 to CNY10,000, \n(CNY15,973 for the PRC and CNY8,961 for Yunnan Province), and average annual net rural \nincome per capita ranged from CNY1,800 to CNY2,240 (CNY3,587  for the PRC and CNY2,250 \nfor Yunnan Province). The project area is predominantly rural; the main agricultural produce are \nrice, tobacco, sugarcane, coffee, vegetables, and fruits. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy10 in the road sector supports (i) the construction of roads that \nconnect major growth centers and link the hinterland economies; (ii) the integration of the \nnetwork so that the national trunk highway system is supported by a system of local roads, \nparticularly those that provide access to poor areas; (iii) the promotion of road safety and \nreduction  of  vehicle  emissions;  (iv) institutional  strengthening  to  increase  the  commercial \norientation and efficiency of expressway organizations; (v) the improvement of highway planning \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2006.

ADB road sector assistance targets the less-developed \ncentral  and  western  provinces,  where  most  of  the  poor  live.  It  also  promotes  regional \ncooperation and integration. Since 1991, ADB has provided 34 loans, totaling nearly $6.9 billion, \nto finance 4,589 km of expressways, together with 9,321 km of associated local road networks. \nThe proposed project is consistent with the PRC\u2019s development priorities and ADB\u2019s strategy. \nRecently completed reviews of the transport sector assistance program11 concluded that ADB\u2019s \nsupport for the PRC road sector in 1997\u20132005 was a success, and suggested giving more \nattention to addressing the question of value addition in ADB-financed road projects. That \nrecommendation will be taken into account in the preparation of the Project. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA will help develop efficient, safe, and clean road transport in the project area. It \nwill help improve the project design, feasibility study, and other related project documents to a \nlevel suitable for ADB financing. A design and monitoring framework, outlining the project\u2019s \nimpact, outcome, outputs, and activities, is in Appendix 1. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The IPSA and REA (Appendix 2) carried out during the fact-finding mission helped identify \nthe social and environmental issues that would need to be addressed during project preparation. \nThe IPSA examined poverty conditions, minority issues, resettlement effects, gender issues, and \nvulnerable groups, and concluded that project preparation should deal with these key issues: \npoverty impact, resettlement effects, HIV/AIDS12 and drug use, and related impacts on ethnic \nminorities. The Project, according to the IPSA, is in involuntary resettlement category A and \nindigenous peoples category A, and requires an RP and an EMDP. According to the REA, it is \nalso in environmental category A, and thus requires a full EIA. The TA will examine the project \ndocuments, and prepare a project that is technically, economically, and financially feasible and \ncomplies  with  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  policies  on  the  environment,  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples. The TA will help develop a results-based monitoring system with adequate baseline \nand target values identified. Key activities will include field surveys, document review, data \nanalysis, and discussion with stakeholders, including government officials, project beneficiaries, \nand project-affected people. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $400,000 of this amount (Appendix 3). The funds will be provided on a grant basis \nfrom ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 through \nin-kind  contributions\u2014counterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  and  other  support  services.  The \nGovernment has been informed that TA approval does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing \nproject. \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2007.

The TA will require 28.5 person-months of consulting services (8.5 international and 20 \ndomestic), spread over 4 months, to carry out the work defined in the terms of reference \n(Appendix 4). ADB will hire a consulting firm through simplified technical proposal procedures \nand quality- and cost-based selection based on an 80:20 quality-to-cost ratio, according to \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time) and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  hiring  of  national  consultants.  The  international \nconsultants will have expertise in (i) highway engineering, (ii) transport economics, (iii) financial \nanalysis and expressway operations, and (iv) social analysis. Expertise required of the national \nconsultants will be in (i) highway engineering; (ii) transport economics; (iii) financial analysis and \nexpressway operations; (iv) transport service and trade facilitation; (v) environmental analysis; \n(vi)  resettlement  planning;  (vii)  poverty,  social,  and  gender  analysis;  (viii)  ethnic  minority \ndevelopment; and (ix) health impact analysis. Equipment will be provided for consultants to \ncarry out the service and will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2006, as amended from time to time). \n \n16.  YPCD will be the Executing Agency and will appoint counterpart staff to coordinate and \nsupervise  the  TA  activities,  including  (i)  monitoring  progress,  (ii)  resolving  issues  during \nimplementation, (iii) assisting in arranging meetings, and (iv) coordinating with government \nagencies  and  organizations.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  ensure  coordination  among  the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Ministry  of  Communications,  State \nEnvironmental Protection Administration, Ministry of Land and Resources, YPCD, and other \ngovernment agencies relevant to the TA. Workshops involving the Government, ADB, and the \nconsultants will be held in the PRC to review the consultants\u2019 reports. Their final report will be \nposted on ADB\u2019s website upon TA completion. The TA will be implemented for about 4 months \nstarting from March 2008 and ending in July 2008.13 \nIV.

Yes  country poverty partnership agreement?  Yes \n \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reducing poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: The \ntransport sector contributes directly to poverty reduction by improving access to markets, employment \nopportunities, and social services, and indirectly by facilitating economic development. The project area is in \na remote part of Yunnan, but connects with an ongoing ADB-financed expressway. The proposed project \nbetween Longlin and Ruili counties will complete the expressway system from Kunming to the Myanmar \nborder. It will reduce travel time and cost, thereby helping to speed up economic development, job creation, \nand improved access to larger markets and higher-quality social services. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe Project will contribute directly to poverty reduction in the project area by generating construction \nemployment opportunities in the short term and improving access to markets for specialty cash crops, such \nas sugarcane and fruits. The Project will substantially improve transport infrastructure and services and will \nfacilitate economic development, thus providing more employment and income generation opportunities for \nlocal people. The Project will also improve access to social services in the county centers and towns. In the \nproject area of Dehong Prefecture and Longling county, 603,800, or 41.8%, of people in the countryside are \nbelow the poverty line. There are two poverty townships and 76 poverty villages. Nearly all the poor belong to \nthe Dai ethnic minority. \n \nA  detailed  poverty  analysis  will  be  carried  out  to  assess  poverty  incidence  in  the  project  area  and \ndemonstrate how the Project will help reduce poverty by incorporating specific measures in the project scope. \nThe analysis will be based on the Handbook on Poverty Analysis, Handbook on Social Analysis, and \nHandbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.

Assess  and  confirm  the  following:  (i)  the  compensation  standards  are  based  on \nreplacement value; (ii) the overall resettlement budget is sufficient to implement the resettlement \nplan, given the proposed entitlements and rehabilitation plans; (iii) adequate land is available for \nreallocation (if there is to be land redistribution) without adversely affecting the host population; \nand (iv) affected people are consulted on the selection of relocation sites (if such sites are to be \ndeveloped), and local government has adequate plans and budget for the provision of new \nvillage  infrastructure.  For  any  seriously  affected  villages,  time-bound  economic  rehabilitation \nplans will be prepared. Identify compensation and rehabilitation options, and develop livelihood \nrehabilitation and improvement programs in consultation with the affected people. Assess and \nconfirm  the  sufficiency  of  the  overall  resettlement  budget  for  land  acquisition  and  RP \nimplementation. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20070928161654+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Keywords": "western yunnan roads development projects, chinese road transport development programs, chinese road project technical assistance reports, chinese transport service, chinese road infrastructure projects, tar: prc 40626", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20071005160956+08'00'", "Title": "Preparing the Western Yunnan Roads Development II Project"}}
