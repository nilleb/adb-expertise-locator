INTRODUCTION \n1.  Establishing the Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region1 will be a flagship \ncorporate technical assistance (TA)2 to enhance operational knowledge and long-term sector \nengagement,  areas  identified  under  the  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB),3 for implementing ADB\u2019s urban sector strategic priorities. The TA will \nfacilitate  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  with  selected  cities  across  Asia  and  the  Pacific, \nproviding integrated planning and support, and assisting them to better manage rapid urban \ngrowth to become more livable. 4 The TA will harmonize ADB investments and assistance and \nfacilitate the convergence of other cross-sector TA projects to support a \u201cOne ADB\u201d5 approach \nto integrated urban development, in partnership with each selected city and government. The \nTA will engage centers of excellence (COEs) to provide best practice knowledge, which will \nguide development of investment programs linked with ADB operations and private sector \npartners. \n \n2.  The TA  is  aligned  with  Strategy  2020,  which  promotes  environmentally  sustainable \ndevelopment, particularly facilitating livable cities, and with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020,  which  emphasizes  ADB\u2019s  actions  need  to  be  innovative,  inclusive,  integrated,  and \noperationally relevant.6 The TA will focus on knowledge solutions consistent with ADB\u2019s Urban \nOperational Plan, 2012\u20132020 by promoting livable cities that are competitive, socially inclusive, \nenvironmentally sustainable, and fiscally sound.7 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  From 1990 to 2010, Asia and the Pacific\u2019s urban population grew by 29%, faster than \nany other region. Between 2010 and 2050, Asia\u2019s cities are expected to rise from 40% to about \n65% of its total population, which is expected to almost double from 1.9 billion to 3.3 billion \npeople. While this presents opportunities for higher productivity and better living standards, \nthere are several risks. An estimated 523 million people across the region live in squalid urban \n                                                \n1  Formerly known as Flagship Study on Future Cities (2050) in Asia and the Pacific, the concept was cleared on 11 \nMay 2015. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwebsite on 29 October 2015. The TA seeks to establish a model for ADB engaging with cities in an integrated \nurban development program. \n2  An ADB-wide, high-level committee, chaired by the vice-president for Knowledge Management and Sustainable \nDevelopment, was established to implement action 3.11 of the Strategy 2020 Midterm Review Action Plan. A \nmeeting on 17 September 2014 discussed flagship knowledge criteria, areas of focus, and implementation \narrangements. \n3  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  The initial cities were selected in close coordination with developing member countries (DMCs) and ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments. Each selected city has current and planned ADB urban projects, strong municipal partnerships, and \nan ability to use financial support to build economic, equitable, and environmentally sustainable cities. The initial \nset of cities includes Tbilisi (Georgia), Colombo Megalopolis (Sri Lanka), Mandalay (Myanmar), Ho Chi Minh City \n(Viet Nam), Greater Suva Area (Suva City and Lami, Nasinu, and Nausori towns) (Fiji), Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), \nand Bandung (Indonesia). Cities in the People\u2019s Republic of China and India were not considered, as ADB is \nalready developing similar programs in those countries, including State-Level Support for National Flagship Urban \nPrograms  (India)  funded  by  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund  (UCCRTF),  and  Strengthening \nProvincial Planning and Implementation for the Yangtze River Economic Belt (People\u2019s Republic of China). \n5  Adapted from ADB Development Effectiveness Review Report (2012). \u201cOne ADB\u201d is the bank's approach to \npromote effective teamwork and clearer accountabilities which involve sector focal points reporting to sector and \ncountry directors and providing links to client sector agencies at the countries for the implementation of the sector \nportfolio, in this case the urban sector. \n6  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n7  ADB. 2013. Urban Operational Plan, 2012\u20132020. Manila. \n ", "2 \nslums with poor services; severe living condition disparities in many cities affect social cohesion; \nand  urban  buildings  and  transport  account  for  significant  energy  consumption  and  carbon \nemissions.  Integrated  urban  planning  is  needed,  focusing  on  managing  urban  sprawl  and \nproviding sustainable and affordable infrastructure and basic services. \n \n4.  The  Asia  and  Pacific  region  is  fast  becoming  a  major  driver  of  greenhouse  gas \nemissions worldwide, and at the same time is increasingly exposed to the risks of climate-\nrelated  hazards,  such  as  floods  and  storm  surges.  In  many  urban  areas,  vulnerability  is \nincreased  because  of  informal  settlements,  lack  of  adequate  infrastructure,  and  limited \ninstitutional  capacity.  High  vulnerability  levels  require  adaptation  strategies  that  focus  on \nresilience to acute as well as chronic climate impacts. The region\u2019s cities must develop strategic \napproaches to climate-resilient urban infrastructure investment. \n \n5.  With about 75% of Asia\u2019s gross domestic product generated in urban areas, the quality \nand efficiency of its cities will determine the region\u2019s long-term productivity and stability.8 Asian \ncities  are  integrated  into  trade  corridors  through  which  they  are  as  connected  to  global \neconomic networks as to their own economy. They are magnets for people seeking a better \nquality  of  life  and  economic  opportunities,  and  loci  of  regional  cooperation  (footnote  7). \nConversely, inefficient and uncompetitive cities inhibit economic growth and impede inclusive \ndevelopment (footnote 8). Asian municipal infrastructure financing is at only 40% of its $100 \nbillion annual maintenance requirement.9 \n \n6.  Stemming the decline or failure of Asian and Pacific cities, while facilitating their rapid \ngrowth, is essential for the region. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 is \nclear: \u201cmake cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.\u201d ADB\u2019s \nUrban  Operational  Plan  also  supports  this  goal  through  an  integrated  urban  investment \napproach  across  the  region,  emphasizing  engagement  with  a  range  of  public  and  private \npartners, and use of ADB resources to leverage increased and diversified funds. \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  Midterm  Review  of  Strategy  2020  also  addresses  the  urban  development \nchallenge,  particularly  in  rapid  urbanization,  significant  infrastructure  constraints,  weak \ngovernance, lack of institutional capacity, and financial instability. It encourages cross-sector \ninitiatives that support clean energy, sustainable transport, climate adaptation, and strengthened \ndisaster risk management, and that apply better integrated planning, governance, and finance \nmodels to sustain urban basic services. The strategy emphasizes long-term engagement and \ntechnical  expertise  to  optimize  sector  resources,  and to  advance  understanding  of  sector-\nspecific challenges to find lasting solutions. There is a need to mobilize interdepartmental and \ninterdisciplinary teams to provide timely and effective multisector solutions to client developing \nmember countries (DMCs) under the One ADB approach. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The TA will focus on long-term engagement with selected cities, supporting integrated \nplanning activities and addressing the urban challenge by bridging quality urban research and \npractice  with  operationally  focused  funding  and  projects.  Acting  as  an  umbrella  and \nconvergence for other urban and cross-sector initiatives, it will embody the One ADB approach. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2011.

World Economic Forum: Geneva. \n ", "  3 \nThe  TA  has  been  developed  in  cooperation  with,  and  with  support  from,  ADB\u2019s  regional \ndepartments, particularly their urban development operations divisions. The selected cities have \nagreed to the proposed partnerships (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n9.  Working with the selected cities, the TA will draw upon regional and country studies, and \nlessons and practices from other leading urban sector institutions. 10 International COEs will \nengage  with  cities  and  catalyze  municipal  stakeholders\u2014contributing  valuable  and  action-\nfocused research and support, and aligning knowledge, funding, and practice. The TA will \nharmonize initiatives from several current and planned regional TA projects, encouraging cross-\nsector practice and identifying public\u2013private partnerships or opportunities to leverage funds\u2014\nfrom ADB\u2019s Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF), the Cities Development \nInitiative for Asia, and other donors\u2014to prepare feasibility and investment projects. 11 \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact will be improved planning for integrated urban development for future cities in \nAsia and the Pacific, which aligns with ADB's Urban Operational Plan, Strategy 2020, and \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020. The outcome will be that selected cities are engaged in an \nintegrated approach towards becoming more livable. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will identify and conduct prefeasibility on new projects for each selected city \nbased  on  an  integrated  growth  management  approach.  Municipalities  will  be  engaged  in \nunderstanding, identifying, and sharing best practice pathways towards future livable cities, and \nwill be supported by COEs, additional cross-sector TA support, and partnerships with other \ncities. Identified projects will be integrated with ADB\u2019s pipeline and city growth management \napproaches and be matched with appropriate project funding modalities for further planning and \nimplementation. Action learning and practice will inform the development of knowledge products \nthat can be shared between future cities and used for engagement with additional cities. \n \n12.  Preparation (by June 2016). As each selected city is at a different growth stage and \nrequires  different  technical  approaches,  ADB  will  begin  by  preparing  integrated  urban \nassessments.12 Using expertise from COEs, urban diagnostics will be undertaken with each city \nto assess long-term development perspectives and connections and commonalities between \nongoing and proposed work, and to establish a platform for further discussion of proposed \nissues, themes, and interventions. The TA will prepare an inventory of existing projects and \nidentify areas for harmonization. The TA will also identify linkages between COEs and the cities \nand preliminary research work. Current and planned cross-sector TA projects that can add \nvalue to each city\u2019s planning program will be ascertained and aligned with the COE program. \nPartner cities, local and international universities, and private organizations for development \ncooperation between cities will be identified and explored for mutual support, complementing TA \nprojects already twinning selected cities for research and mentoring on urban management \n                                                \n10 For example: ADB. 2014. State of the Pacific Cities and Towns. Manila.   \n11 TA projects that will be converged by the Future City Program are outlined in Supplementary Appendix A. \n12 Initial assessments of each city\u2019s specific needs and context and ongoing initiatives are in Supplementary \nAppendix B. Methodology and activities will be tailored to the needs of each of the selected cities. \n ", "4 \nissues.13 City mayors will meet to discuss harmonization and mutual learning opportunities \nsupported by preliminary TA research results. Detailed work plans will be prepared for each city, \nidentifying outputs, responsibilities, budgets, and timing in consultation with central government \nagencies. These will then be shared project-wide. This phase will inform the TA\u2019s work and \nstudy program with each city. \n \n13.  Pathways towards future livable cities (by December 2016). Following preparation, \nselected cities will be supported to explore and identify urban growth pathways towards a future \nlivable city.14 COEs and other identified partners will work with each city and undertake directed \nresearch. This will be reinforced through research from other cross-sector TA projects and city \ntwinning arrangements. Each city will identify best practice urban growth models, financing \nmechanisms,  and  development  approaches,  and  will  assess  their  municipal  planning, \nmanagement,  and  financial  policies  and  practices.  Urban  management  pathways  towards \nlivable cities will be identified through consensus-building symposia, bringing together research, \nvisioning,  and  urban  practitioners,  and  identifying  integrated  infrastructure  investments  and \nfunding options. These approaches and proposed programs will be shared with other selected \ncities, twinning, and private sector partners through a future cities forum. \n \n14.  Project identification (by June 2017). Through this cross-sector, consensus-building \nplanning approach, an integrated series of future livable cities-focused projects will be identified \nfor  financing.  A  few  investment  projects  will  be  developed  to  prefeasibility  stage,  so  their \nconcept can be easily developed into full projects. Funding modalities and partners for further \nplanning and implementation will be identified and discussed, and projects will be matched with \nmechanisms such as ADB grants (e.g., UCCRTF), sovereign and nonsovereign loans, TA, and \npublic\u2013private partnerships. Executing agencies, resident missions, and regional departments \nwill be engaged throughout the process so projects are supported and incorporated into country \noperational business plans. Projects identified will include strengthening municipal planning \napproaches and institutions so they can further integrate research and partner knowledge, \nsustaining the future cities approach.  \n \n15.  Knowledge management. Throughout the TA, knowledge management will be at the \nforefront. Research and practice will be published for exchange with and use by other future \ncities, and will be accessible by their citizens. Using planned information and communication \ntechnology-related TA projects, such as the Promoting Smart City Development, cities will be \nable to share data and learning with their populace, and encourage citizen engagement in \nplanning.  It  is  expected  that  urban  management  practices  and  approaches  discerned  and \nrecorded by each city will inform preparatory activities for additional cities in subsequent TA \nproposals. A program to disseminate the TA results will be developed and disseminated through \nan international symposium (with possible initial discussion of results at ADB\u2019s 2017 Annual \nMeeting in Yokohama). \n \n16.  The TA assumes continued support for the selected cities\u2019 development and growth by \ncentral and local governments, continued interest by DMC policy makers and stakeholders to \nimprove urban planning and management, adequate funding and institutional capacity in the \nselected cities, and stakeholder ability to reach consensus on priorities and attract project \nimplementation funding. The risk is that urban stakeholders will ignore best practice approaches, \n                                                \n13 TA projects include, for example, the planned Technical Assistance for Promoting Smart City Development, to be \nfunded by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and is expected to be approved in 2016. \n14 Integrated framework approaches such as ADB\u2019s GrEEEn City Action Plan will be reviewed for lessons. \n ", "  5 \nor  not  wish  to  harmonize  their  activities  or  share  information  and  data.  Policy  dialogues, \nknowledge  sharing  and  peer-to-peer  learning,  in  close  consultation  with  the  regional \ndepartments, will be conducted during the TA implementation.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). In-kind contributions from the government include \ntechnical personnel and support services, and from centers of excellence research support and \nworkshops. The cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency and will implement through the Urban Sector Group \nSecretariat in the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The Secretariat \nwill work regional departments, Private Sector Operations Department and with other sector and \nthematic groups to facilitate cross-sector approaches in the selected cities. Representatives \nidentified from ADB\u2019s regional departments will play an important role in TA management and \nimplementation. International and national consultants, as well as researchers from COEs and \nother  institutions,  will  support the  implementation  team. The TA  will  be  implemented from \nJanuary 2016 to December 2017.  \n \n19.  The TA will build on ADB urban development TA, projects, and programs, in addition to \nnational urban assessments being undertaken to meet the urban operational plan outputs. \nSupplementary Appendix A outlines current and planned cross-sector TA projects that will be \napplied in some or all of the selected cities. The planning approach will coordinate with the \nCities Development Initiative for Asia and UCCRTF on project preparation and will provide \ndetailed planning and implementation support.  \n \n20.  The TA will require 14 person-months of international and 62 person-months of national \nindividual consultant inputs. Consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). COEs that are partnered with ADB \nthrough  a knowledge partnership  agreement  and  have  delivered  high-quality  research  and \nurban diagnostics will provide resources, research, and international best practice knowledge \nfor  the  city  planning  process,  centered  on  a  work  plan  to  be  identified  with  cities  during \npreparation. 15 TA  disbursements  will  be  made  following  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).16 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Establishing the Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n                                                \n15 COEs will be engaged under their existing Knowledge Partnership Agreements based on the memo for Head of \nDepartments  on  Clarification  on  Cooperation  Arrangements  for  Development  Partnerships,  7  August  2014 \n(internal). \n16 Appendix 3 provides the outline terms of reference for the consultants. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nImpact the Technical Assistance is Aligned with \nImproved planning for integrated urban development for future cities in Asia and the Pacific.

General \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will administer a corporate technical assistance (TA) \nto support selected cities in the Asia and Pacific region. The TA will act as a sector umbrella, \ncoordinating and converging other technical assistances, consultants, centers of excellence \n(COEs), and private sector partners to engage with the cities. ADB, through its Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department (SDCC), will be the executing agency. SDCC \nwill lead overall implementation in collaboration with ADB\u2019s regional departments and Private \nSector Operations Department. \n \n2.  ADB\u2019s regional departments identified the future cities with support by the city mayors. In \nprinciple, authorities of each relevant developing member country and other stakeholders have \nconsented with the TA project. The initial cities selected include Tbilisi (Georgia), Colombo \nMegalopolis (Sri Lanka), Mandalay (Myanmar), Ho Chi Minh City (Viet Nam), Greater Suva Area \n(Suva City and Lami, Nasinu, and Nausori towns) (Fiji), Ulaanbaatar (Mongolia), and Bandung \n(Indonesia). \n \n3.  COEs will provide the core research and practices underpinning the future city planning \nprocess. ADB already has partnership agreements with some COEs and has engaged them in \nearly knowledge work through ADB\u2019s Knowledge Sharing and Services Center. The COEs will \nbe engaged under their existing ADB partnership agreements. They will deliver analytical and \noperationally relevant inputs based on partner cities\u2019 work plans, formulated during preparation, \nand later as needed. \n \n4.  The TA will require 14 person-months of international and 62 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs to coordinate and manage the planning processes for the selected cities. The \nexperts, who will play a critical facilitation role, should have strong technical planning knowledge \nand skills to adequately use resources and engage with partner agencies.
