During  the  Country  Programming  Mission  in  2001,  the  Government  of  Sri  Lanka \nconfirmed its request for technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprepare the Greater Colombo Wastewater Project. After further discussions, the Government \nand ADB agreed that a TA1 would be provided in 2004, and the proposed loan in 2006 subject \nto approval by ADB's Board of Directors. A Fact-Finding Mission was conducted in Colombo, Sri \nLanka, from 27 September to 4 October 2004 to prepare the TA. The Mission held discussions \nwith the External Resources Department (ERD), Ministry of Urban Development and Water \nSupply (MUDWS), National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB), Colombo Municipal \nCouncil (CMC), and  Central Environmental Authority (CEA) to reach an understanding on the \nTA objectives, scope, costs, and implementation arrangements. The Mission also consulted the \nCoast Conservation Department, Marine Pollution Prevention Authority, and National Aquatic \nResources  Agency  on  issues  relating  to  the  coastal  environment.  The  preliminary  project \nframework is attached as Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The sewerage network is limited to a small area serving approximately 25% of Greater \nColombo, and a large section of it is old and in urgent need of rehabilitation. Effective sewage \ndisposal is a necessary condition, not only for growth but to protect the environment from \nincreasing levels of pollution resulting from various development activities. \n \n3.  During  the  Fact-Finding  Mission,  the  Government  confirmed  as  a  priority  area  the \nrehabilitation and expansion of the Greater Colombo2 sewerage system. The Government \nacknowledges that due to lack of finances and institutional capacity, investment to rehabilitate \nand to expand the sewerage network will be done through concessionary foreign financing, \nwhile possibly outsourcing some functions  in the operation and maintenance (O&M) of the \nsewage disposal systems.  \n \n4.  Built between 1906 and 1920, and substantially rebuilt and extended with financing from \nthe World Bank and Saudi Fund in the 1980s, some parts of the system need urgent repair. \nThere are two long outfalls, one located in the northern part of Colombo at Mutwal and another \nin the southern part of Colombo at Wellawatta. The outfall at Mutwal is damaged. The sewer \npipes,  approximately  300  kilometers  long,  are  partly  suffering  from acid attack. Eighteen \npumping stations are not operating efficiently, suffering from breakdowns. Out of 67 pumps, 25-\n30% are not working, with the pump water seal and priming systems either broken or in very \npoor condition. Due to its poor condition and a low rate of connection, the system cannot \nperform to full capacity. \n \n5.  Improvement of system performance, complemented by a higher rate of connection, will \nhelp achieve sustainability in O&M. Consumers need to be encouraged to connect where \nfeasible, instead of relying on on-site sanitation. In addition, there is a need to address illegal \nconnections that have diverted wastewater into the canals. The system is also experiencing \nfrequent overflows, resulting in further diversion of wastewater to canals and lakes in Colombo. \n \n6.  NWSDB is aware of these problems and realizes the potential of improving the O&M of \nthe sewerage system. The system, which was transferred to NWSDB in 1996, was traditionally \noperated and maintained by CMC. Although NWSDB is the owner of the sewerage system, \nO&M has been undertaken primarily by CMC. With no contractual agreement between NWSDB \n                                                 \n1  The TA first  appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 1 September 2004. \n2  Greater Colombo, as defined in this study, comprises (i) the Colombo Municipal Council area, (ii) sewered   \n   areas of Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council, and (iii) Kollonawa Urban Council area. \n ", "2  \nand CMC that specifies performance standards and penalties for nonperformance, there are no \nclear institutional arrangements for maintaining and operating the system. With no sewerage \ntariff being charged to water users connected to the system, CMC relies heavily on property \ntaxes to help pay for O&M of the system. \n \n7.  Both parties have recognized the efficiencies that could be gained through performance-\nbased  O&M  contracts.  However,  lack  of  experience  in  this  area  and  unclear  institutional \narrangements have prevented both parties from working toward a cost-efficient  arrangement for \nO&M. \n \n8.  The  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  introduce  cost-recovery  through  tariffs  to \nensure sustainability in the O&M of the sewerage system. The Government has moved to \ninitiate plans for the introduction of a sewerage tariff.  Cabinet approval for the introduction of \nthe sewerage charge was obtained in September 2002. NWSDB Board approval has also been \nobtained and gazette notification has been prepared and forwarded to the Attorney General\u2019s \nDepartment for opinion. However, a tariff is yet to be instituted. MUDWS in the meantime \ncontinues its work on reviewing the proposed sewerage charges.  \n \n9.  The needs of low-income households, particularly the urban poor, which comprise half of \nthe population of Colombo, have yet to be addressed (Appendix 2 gives the summary initial \npoverty and social analysis). The absence of sewerage connections in most areas occupied by \nthe urban poor calls for other solutions. Where it will not be feasible for them to connect, on-site \nsanitation will meet their wastewater management needs. The poor have suffered from lack of \naccess, as well as a lack of awareness of the negative environmental impacts of illegally \ndumping wastewater onto canals and lakes. Addressing the sanitation needs of low-income \nhouseholds,  including  those  of  the  urban  poor,  will  form  part  of  improving  wastewater \nmanagement in Greater Colombo. As part of its Poverty Reduction Program, CMC has initiated \nprograms to build sanitation systems in selected areas of low-income communities. These steps \nwill need to be further augmented to ensure access  of low-income households to sanitation. \n \n10.  As the Government faces the challenging task of managing wastewater through the \nsewerage system and on-site sanitation, it will have to seek cost-efficient ways of delivering the \nservice, involving private sector where appropriate. The private sector can be encouraged to \nparticipate in the service of emptying and treating sewage in the Greater Colombo area, helping \nthe Government achieve its goal of effectively managing wastewater. The private sector can \nalso be called upon to operate and maintain parts of the system, and help improve system \nperformance.   \n \n11.  The Government has already drafted the Water Services Reform Bill for the water \nsector.  The  bill  introduces  specificity  in  licensing  service  providers,  setting  tariffs,  service \nstandards,  efficiency  indicators,  consumer  rights  and  obligations,  and  dispute  resolution. \nAlthough the bill was contested by local authorities (LAs), a redrafted bill has been completed \nand is to be submitted to Parliament. Pending the passage of the redrafted bill, the Government \nis now contemplating how private sector participation can best be encouraged and regulated \nwithin the existing laws. \n \n12.  Within the given framework, the TA will prepare a project to rehabilitate the Greater \nColombo sewerage system, support further reforms in institutional arrangements, and seek \nfurther progress in sector reforms that will make O&M of Greater Colombo sewerage system \nsustainable in the long run. The TA will also focus on improving sanitation in the Greater \nColombo area. \n \n ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n13.  The objective of the consultancy is to prepare a project that is suitable for ADB financing. \nThe  proposed  investments  will primarily include rehabilitation and upgrading of the sewer \nnetwork and pumping stations, and repairs to the sewer outfalls.  In addition, institutional and \ncapacity-building  components  will  be  formulated  to  improve  asset  management,  financial \nmanagement,  and  O&M  of  the  sewerage  system.  For  on-site  sanitation,  the  proposed \ninvestment project will focus on the implementation of improved design and installation, and \npossible institutional and technological options for emptying, treating, and disposing of septage. \nSanitation solutions for the low-income groups and poor communities will be addressed. The \nconsultancy will also develop procurement documents for components identified as priorities \nand for which designs are available.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  (i)  increase  the  capacity  of  Greater  Colombo  institutions  to  manage \nwastewater, (ii) provide all necessary information to prepare a project to undertake the physical \nrehabilitation and upgrade of the Greater Colombo sewerage system and improvement of on-\nsite sanitation, and (iii) implement the necessary institutional and policy reforms to ensure \nfinancially and institutionally sustainable solutions for the Greater Colombo sewerage system. \nThe TA will prepare a project to support and advance current policy reforms in the sector. The \nTA will also design a public consultation strategy to be followed during the TA and updated \nduring  project processing by ADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  Greater Colombo, as defined in this study, comprises (i) the  CMC area, (ii) sewered \nareas of Dehiwala-Mt. Lavinia Municipal Council, and (iii) Kollonawa Urban Council area. For \non-site sanitation, the project area will be Greater Colombo as defined above and five adjacent \nLAs within Western Province for the purpose of developing a pilot program. Four LAs will be \nconfirmed at the inception. The possible five areas will be (i) Avissawella, (ii) Bandaragama, (iii) \nKaluthara, (iv) Moratuwa, and (v) Panadura. The TA activities will be in three areas:     \n \n(i)  On-site  facilities  (outside  sewered  areas).  The  scope  will  include  (a) \nimplementation of improved design and installation, and (b) possible institutional \nand technological options for emptying, treating and disposing of septage.  \n \n(ii)  Main sewered areas. The scope will include (a) further institutional change; (b) \ninstitutional  development  in  asset  management  planning  and  environmental \nmonitoring; (c) performance-based contracting for efficient O&M; (d) strategy to \ninclude low-income and underserved settlements; (e) capital works programs for \ncollection, treatment, and disposal; (f) a financial management strategy, including \na  review  of  policies  related  to  connection  charges;  and  (g)  associated \nprocurement  packages  for  capital  works  that  are  part  of  the  project  to  be \ndesigned.  \n \n(iii)  Commercial  and  institutional  wastewater. The focus will be on designing \npretreatment  standards  for  wastewater  generated  by  small-scale  industries \ndischarging within the sewer network (e.g., gas service stations, hotels, and \nhospitals  that  discharge  wastewater  into  the  sewer/drainage  system).  The \nconsultants  will  also  design  standard  pretreatment  facilities  for  small-scale \nindustries (e.g., service stations, hotels, and restaurants) to meet the proposed \ndischarge standards. \n ", "4  \n \n16.  For both on-site facilities and main sewered areas, the focus will be on solutions for the \nurban poor. Possible technical solutions may include (i) constructing permanent connections to \nthe sewers with chambers to allow the easy emptying of the contents of on-site facilities; (ii) \nproviding individual portable chemical toilets for use in association with such chambers; (iii) on-\nsite facilities already commonly used; (iv) constructing shallow sewer systems, but taking \naccount of the fact that many households do  not have internal plumbing to use water as a \ncarrier; (v) coordinating other aid-assisted projects that work in these areas; (vi) giving low-\nincome groups access to the main sewerage system; and (vii) constructing small bore systems \nto take liquid wastes to the sewers. \n \n17.  The TA will also prepare (i) a strategy for implementing tariff and cost recovery in the \nwastewater sector; (ii) an investment project suitable for financing by ADB and following ADB\u2019s \npolicies; and (iii) economic and financial feasibility studies, as well as environmental and social \nimpact assessments of proposed capital works. The TA will provide all information necessary for \nthe preparation of a loan project following ADB's operational guidelines. \n \n18.  Additional activities to be undertaken during the TA include (i) conducting stakeholder \nconsultations and workshops, (ii) making required studies and surveys, and (iii) preparing \nrequired reports. The project team will also carry out policy dialogue to ensure participation and \ncommitment of the Government in required policy and institutional changes.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,150,000 equivalent, comprising $500,000 in \nforeign exchange and  $650,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The entire foreign exchange \ncost of $500,000 and $350,000 equivalent in local currency will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government of Sri Lanka will \ncontribute the remaining local currency cost of $300,000 for office accommodation, counterpart \nstaff support, and other administrative expenses and will provide all information required for the \nTA activities. The Government of Sri Lanka has been informed that approval of the TA does not \ncommit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MUDWS will be the Executing Agency of the TA and will be responsible for overall \ncoordination  with  ADB.  NWSDB  is  a  key  implementing  agency  and  CMC  will  be  a  co-\nimplementing agency for activities related to the sewered area of Colombo. NWSDB will provide \nfull administrative and technical support to the consultants and will coordinate all activities under \nthe TA with other Government agencies. NWSDB will provide the consultants with adequate \noffice space and sufficient means of communication. NWSDB will appoint a full-time project \ndirector by 31 January 2004. \n \n21.  Before the consultants begin fieldwork, MUDWS will establish a TA steering committee, \nchaired by the secretary of MUDWS, and consisting of senior officials of NWSDB and CMC; \nrepresentatives of the main LAs (except CMC), Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Provincial \nCouncils and Local Government, Western Provincial Council, Urban Development Authority \n(UDA),  CEA,  Coast  Conservation  Department,  Marine  Pollution  Prevention  Authority,  aid-\nagencies and ADB. The steering committee will meet at least once every 2 months during \nproject implementation to discuss the reports of the consultants after the inception, midterm, \nand final workshops, or upon achievement of key milestones by the consultants.  \n \n22.  A project-level working group will be established, chaired by the Project Management \nUnit of NWSDB and with members from CMC, main LAs, UDA, CEA, and civil society advocacy ", "  5\ngroups to coordinate project-level activities. The working group will meet at least once a month \nduring TA implementation. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 7 months from April 2005 to October 2005. Consulting \nservices for the TA will total 67 person-months (14 international and 46 domestic), excluding \ninputs of local institutions that will conduct a survey of baseline socioeconomic conditions, \nwillingness to pay, attitude toward grey water, supply of software and sewer system modeling, \nand outfall modeling in the coastal areas. Inputs of a legal firm to draft model performance \ncontracts (Appendix 4, para 8) are also excluded. An international firm will be engaged to \norganize the TA activities and produce the intermediate and final outputs for review and \napproval by MUDWS and ADB. The experts to be provided by the firm will include wastewater \nengineers, structural engineer, hydraulic engineer, mechanical and electrical engineer, quantity \nsurveyor, procurement specialist, environmental specialist, project economist, social/gender \ndevelopment  specialist,  institutional  development  specialist,  public  utility  finance  specialist, \nfinancial analyst, resettlement specialist, information technology and network specialist, and \npublic awareness consultant. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. \n \n24.  The TA will provide equipment such as computers and other office equipment that the \nconsultant will purchase in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The equipment \nwill be handed over to NWSDB upon completion of the TA. The TA will also provide funds for \nworkshops, surveys, and studies to be conducted by the consultants under arrangements \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n25.  The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants,  and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants. A full technical proposal with the quality- and cost-based selection method will be \nused to select the consulting firm. The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report, due within \n1  month  of  TA  commencement;  (ii)  an  interim  report,  due  within  4  months  of  TA \ncommencement; (iii) a draft final report, due within 6 months of TA commencement; and (iv) a \nfinal report, upon completion of the TA study. During implementation, the consultants will \norganize three workshops in Colombo to discuss the inception, interim, and draft final reports. \nTripartite meetings will be held immediately after the workshops for the inception, interim, and \ndraft final reports. The  consultants will also organize participatory meetings throughout TA \nimplementation, to disseminate information on the project and incorporate feedback from local \nstakeholders in the project design.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Sri Lanka for  preparing the Greater Colombo Wastewater Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators and    and Risks \nTargets   \nGoal       \nImproved wastewater  Reduced pollution  Periodic monitoring by   \nmanagement in Greater  loads to canals and  National Water Supply and   \nColombo    other water bodies in  Drainage Board (NWSDB)   \n  Greater Colombo     \n    Colombo Municipal \n    Council (CMC) Public \nHealth Department \nstatistical reports \nPurpose      Assumptions \nImprove asset and  Development and  Asset condition surveys by  Willingness to connect to the \nmanagement of the  implementation of  NWSDB  sewerage system and pay \nGreater Colombo  performance-based    associated tariffs \nsewerage system   indicators for asset     \n  management in the     \n  sewered areas      \n  .     \nDevelop institutional  Implementation of a  Number of contract  Readiness of both parties to \ncapacity to improve  performance-based  condition violations and  implement performance-\nfinancial and asset  contract between the  public reports and  based contracts  \nmanagement in the  asset owner and asset  complaints    \nsector  operators      \n       \nImplement cost  Implementation of the  Annual financial  Timely institution of tariffs to \nrecovery in the  sewerage charge   statements of NWSDB  achieve cost recovery \nsewerage sector       \n      Risks \nImprove access to  Increased number of  Connection reports  Delays in project \nappropriate sanitation  sewerage connections  Customer billing database  implementation \nby underserved areas  (domestic, institutional,  local authority permits   \nwithin the sewered area  and industrial) in the  Political will for \nand areas outside the  sewered areas  implementation of \nsewered areas    contractual obligations \n  Increased number of   \n  on-site sanitation \nfacilities \nOutputs1       \nActivities1       \nInputs1       \n1 \nTo be developed during technical assistance implementation. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.

These are the same areas where grey water is disposed of haphazardly on \nsurface soil and to the canals, and where pollution could be a contributor to higher incidence of certain diseases, such \nas cholera and dengue. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nA large population live scattered in varying sizes of settlements throughout the municipal areas of Colombo, Dehiwala-\nMt. Lavinia. A 1998 survey covering the municipal area of Colombo recorded 54,511 units, distributed in 1,704 \nsettlements. The settlements have a population of 350,000, representing 43% of the city population. A more recent \nstudy revealed that 56% of poor families in the city do not have access to adequate and reliable drinking water, only \n33% of the households have individual toilet facilities, 65% use shared toilet facilities and 2% have no toilet facilities at \nall.  \n \nA poverty impact analysis for components of the project will need to be undertaken during the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA). \n \nC.

Most were consulted extensively \nduring the small-scale TA1 The proposed TA will conduct baseline socioeconomic surveys including willingness to pay \nand attitude toward grey water. \n \nCMC has periodically sought the participation of nongovernment organizations (NGOs) in its projects. During the TA, \nkey stakeholders including NGOs and community-based organizations (CBOs) will be encouraged to participate in \nworkshops to give their views on the proposed project.   \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nSince women are mainly engaged in domestic activities and perform the key roles of wife, mother, and social \ncollaborator, their roles make them the main spokespersons of their families. Their participation in activities generated \nby the interplay of community-based agents such as CBOs and NGOs is considered significant.  \nWomen\u2019s visibility in the sector depends on what benefits accrue to them from the sector. In a shanty and slum \nsettlement where health and sanitation are critical issues, women have to use common toilets; and where the natural \ninstinct for privacy usually inherent in women is not respected, there is a strong willingness among them to participate \nin order to address their fears. \nContinued on next page\n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nin order to address their fears. \n \nIn summary, the strategy to enlist women in participation should incorporate aspects such as project benefits to be \ndisseminated through CBOs and NGOs. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

The consultant \nwill become familiar with existing manuals, guidelines, new regulations, and existing practices to \ndevelop suitable designs for domestic wastewater treatment for different soil permeabilities \n(e.g., high groundwater areas and coastal areas). The consultant, in consultation with the LAs, \nwill also determine training needs and develop a training program for efficient implementation of \nthe  proposed  options.    On  the  basis  of  the  results,  the  consultant  will  develop  a  public \nawareness campaign for effective dissemination. \n \n3.  The consultant will study and develop an environment-friendly and economical method \nto treat wastewater from gully emptying tanks, and thereafter develop the bidding documents to \nevaluate, negotiate, and contract for a pilot project.   \n \n2.  Main Sewered Areas \n \n4.  Customer Enumeration Survey. The consultant will begin by using and analyzing \nexisting data to determine more accurate figures of the actual number of connections, including \nillegal connections. The information will be used to establish key performance indicators (KPI) in \nthe service contracts (e.g., number of connections to be made per month) and connection \npolicies. The consultant will design a survey and recommend any necessary hardware and \nsoftware\u2013both to be carried out during project implementation\u2013to construct a database that \nindicates water sources and presence of sewer connections. The database will be linked to the \nexisting National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) customer roll. The consultant \ntherefore must also investigate the necessary administrative changes including appropriate \ncost-sharing arrangements. The consultant will then identify an investment and training program \nto implement the recommendations. \n \n5.  Financial Strategy. The consultant will update any previous studies on sewerage tariff \nconducted  by  NWSDB,  Colombo  Municipal  Council  (CMC),  and  LAs  (e.g.,  Associated \nManagement Services produced a report on a sewerage tariff in 2000). On the basis of the \nresults, the consultant will provide a tariff model to meet efficient operation and maintenance \n(O&M) (O&M includes annual infrastructure renewals cost) of the system. This should be done \nin  consultation  with  Government  people  involved  in  tariff  regulating  mechanisms,  reform \nprograms, and policies (this section may not be needed and may be dropped if the proposed \nsewerage changes are implemented). The consultant will update a willingness-to-pay survey \nand develop a strategy for implementing a cost-recovery tariff in the medium term. This strategy \n                                                 \n1 The consultants will perform their work based on existing comprehensive studies, which may require revision and \nupdating as necessary. One such study is the Greater Colombo Wastewater Management Review, completed in \nAugust 2004 and funded through a small-scale technical assistance by the Asian Development Bank. \n ", "  Appendix 4  11 \nshould also include the mechanism to educate the public on the expected benefits to the \ncustomer and the environment.   \n \n6.  Institutional  Development  in  Asset  Management  Planning.    The consultant  will \nprovide a most appropriate sewer system modeling software to use and to be developed to best \npractice asset management standards. The consultant will also undertake limited manhole and \nflow surveys to build and verify the model (for those sections where the asset details are \navailable)  and  develop  an  asset  management  plan.  The  consultant  will  further  develop  a \nmanagement information systems (MIS) to put NWSDB in a competitive position to bid for \nservice contracts on an open transparent basis in the future. Such MIS will include (i) asset \nmanagement software, (ii) financial information and cost analysis for operational activities, (iii) \ncompliance sampling and monitoring, and (iv) quality assurance systems. The consultant will \nalso  identify  institutional  requirements  for  monitoring  (e.g.,  environmental  monitoring),  and \ndevelop  a  program  and  investment  plan  to  institutionalize  performance  monitoring  of  the \nsewerage system. \n \n7.  Training and Public Disclosure.  For this activity, the consultant will develop (i) a \ntraining plan for managing  the MIS; (ii) a manual of best practices for asset management, which \nwill include sewer connection, O&M, etc.; and (iii) a model for public response and disclosure \nprogram for the sector. All these will be implemented as part of the project. \n \n8.  Furthering Institutional Change. The consultant will review the adequacy of the draft \nWater Services Reform Bill and the proposed alternatives pending its passage. Taking this into \nconsideration, the consultant will draft model performance2 (based on KPI developed, para. 4) \ncontracts between the asset owner and the asset operator (may be a separate institute or even \na department within the same institute) based on the institutional arrangements suggested and \nagreed upon during the small-scale technical assistance (SSTA). The consultant will develop \ncost models for the individual contracts to assist in determining the initial contract values based \non best practice asset management standards developed above. The contractual agreement \nshould include a provision for outsourcing services by the asset owner and the asset operator. \nThe  consultant  will  identify  possible  areas  for  outsourcing  under  the  overall  institutional \narrangements.  \n  \n9.  Asset Management Plan and Initial Capital Works  Program. The consultant will \nassess, prioritize, and define in detail the capital works program for the main sewered areas. \nThis activity will primarily consist of rehabilitation works based on the recommendations in the \nDepartment for International Development (DFID)-funded study of 1999,3 and updated by the \nSSTA as well as any available updates to the structural development plans.  It should also \ninclude any other updates and other works proposed or undertaken by NWSDB and CMC. Any \nproposed option must have technical, financial, economical, and environmental viability, and \nmay need to include a phased program for treatment and disposal. Having developed a capital \nworks program in consultation with NWSDB, CMC, and ADB, the consultant will develop draft \nprocurement  documents  for  packages  identified  as  priorities  and  for  which  designs  are \navailable.  For other packages, the consultant will develop conceptual designs and identify \nfurther works to be included in the investment phase or as turnkey contracts. The consultant will \ndevelop a sample terms of reference for a design, management, and supervision consultancy \nfor use during implementation of the Project. \n \n                                                 \n2   Inputs from a legal firm will be required. \n3  Department for International Development. 1999.
