During the Country Programming Mission in April 2004, the Government requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide small-scale technical assistance (TA) to implement \nthe newly developed regulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance.  An ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission visited Viet Nam on 16\u201320 May 2005 and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment  on  the  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.1 The TA is included in the Country Strategy \nand Program Update for 2004\u20132006.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Some 80% of Viet Nam\u2019s poor live in rural areas, and 45% of rural households are poor. \nViet Nam\u2019s poor depend largely on farming and are characterized by relatively low agricultural \nproductivity resulting partly from low access to capital and land. About 8% of rural households \nare landless. The poor are also vulnerable to shocks from illness and death in the household, \ncommodity price fluctuations, and natural disasters. Development of sustainable rural finance \ncan  therefore  have  a  significant  impact  on  economic  growth,  poverty  reduction,  and  risk \nmanagement. \n \n3.  Efforts  to  increase  access  to  rural  financial  services  in  Viet  Nam  coincided  with \nagricultural reforms in the early 1990s, particularly the formation of private farms. The reforms \ncreated a demand for capital by the 12 million rural households, of which about 10 million \nconstitute decollectivized farms. National strategies to expand rural finance have been pursued \nmainly through the state sector using specialized banks and credit unions. For example, the Viet \nNam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (VBARD) has about 4 million clients, the \nSocial Policy Bank (SPB, formerly the Viet Nam Bank for the Poor) has about 2.5 million clients, \nand the credit union network of the Central Credit Fund and its affiliated People\u2019s Credit Funds \nhave almost 1 million clients. The expansion of the banking network made financial services \naccessible to about 7 million rural households, including about 3 million poor households. While \nexpansion of outreach has been impressive, nearly half of rural poor households, mostly in \nmore remote regions of the country where poverty is most concentrated, still do not have access \nto financial services from institutional sources.  Policy makers have recognized that, in addition \nto the state-owned institutions, the approaches and methods of microfinance institutions (MFIs) \ncan make an important contribution to poverty reduction in Viet Nam, particularly with their \noutreach to the remoter areas. \n \n4.  The  \u201csemiformal  sector\u201d  (as  it  is  termed  in  Viet  Nam)  consists  of  (i)  government \nministries  providing  microfinance  services;  (ii)  mass  organizations  including  the  Viet  Nam \nWomen\u2019s Union (VWU), the Viet Nam Farmer\u2019s Union, and the Viet Nam Youth Union, which \nprovide small loans on their own account, implement programs for international nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), and facilitate the formation of credit groups for VBARD; and (iii) some 58 \ninternational NGOs that support microfinance programs, for the most part channeled through \nthe mass organizations, especially VWU, which is authorized by Prime Minister\u2019s Letters to \ncarry on credit and savings activities. The semiformal sector is small and accounts for only \nabout 5% of the rural finance market. Following the lead of VBARD and SPB, virtually all \nsemiformal programs deliver services at interest rates below levels required for sustainability, \nconstraining their ability to expand outreach. \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 30 June 2005. \n2 ADB.  2003.  Country Strategy and Program Update for 2004\u20132006.  Viet Nam.   ", "2     \n \n \n5.  Until recently, there was no comprehensive legal framework for microfinance services \nbecause they effectively fall outside the Law on Credit Institutions. As a result, the legal status \nof  activities  carried  out  under  microfinance  projects  supported  by  ministries,  mass \norganizations, and international development agencies was ambiguous. This lack of clarity in \nthe  legal  and  regulatory  environment,  along  with  crowding  out  by  VBARD\u2019s  and  SPB\u2019s \nsubsidized lending, has been a major reason for the reluctance of international development \nagencies and potential investors to expand existing microfinance programs or start new ones. \nThe absence of an effective legal form for MFIs has meant that the transition from mass \norganization or NGO activities to formalized MFI has not been possible. \n \n6.  The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) Banking Inspectorate Department (BID) is responsible \nfor inspecting all credit institutions (as defined by the Law on Credit Institutions) onsite at least \nonce a year. Rural credit institutions are inspected the same way as other financial institutions. \nOffsite inspection is done monthly based on financial institution reporting to BID. However, \nbecause  microfinance  services  fall  outside  the  Law  on  Credit  Institutions,  there  is  no \ninspectorate system for them.  \n \n7.  To  improve  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  framework  and  thus  enable  the \nestablishment  and  expansion  of  formal  microfinance  initiatives,  ADB  provided  assistance \nthrough TA 3741-VIE: Preparing the Framework for Microfinance Development.3 Among other \nactivities, that TA assisted (i) prepare a microfinance framework for developing the sector, (ii) \nprepare  a  Prime  Minister\u2019s  Decree  on  the  legal  framework  for  microfinance,  (iii)  specify \nsupervisory and regulatory procedures and accounting and financial reporting requirements, (iv) \nprepare manuals for onsite and offsite supervision and reporting formats, (v) prepare reporting \nand  disclosure  requirements  for  MFIs  whose  scale  of  operations  is  too  small  for  formal \nregulation, and (vi) train SBV staff. \n \n8.  The Prime Minister\u2019s Decree No. 28/2005/ND-CP (Decree No. 28) on the Organization \nand Operation of Microfinance Institutions in Viet Nam, issued on 9 March 2005, authorizes \nSBV to issue a variety of legal documents (e.g., guidelines, regulations, circulars, etc.) to \nimplement  the  decree.  For  example,  SBV  must  issue  (i)  guidelines  on  MFI  branch \nestablishment; (ii) regulations regarding sound operations of MFIs wishing to mobilize deposits; \n(iii) guidelines for consolidation, merger, splitting, dissolution, bankruptcy, and liquidation of \nMFIs; (iv) guidelines on the qualifications, election, appointment, and dismissal of an MFI\u2019s \nboard  of  management,  control  committee,  and  general  director;  (v)  regulations  on  entitled \nmicrofinance operations; (vi) guidelines on the maximum size of loans made, and deposits \naccepted, by MFIs; (vii) guidelines on MFI accounts and ledgers; (viii) guidelines on reporting \nand statistical obligations (in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance [MOF]); and (ix) provisions \non the rights and duties of inspected MFIs. \n \n9.  Moreover, MOF is to issue (i) instructions on licensing fees of MFIs; and (ii) a circular \ncovering  guidelines  on  finance  in  (receipt)  and  out  (payment)  of  MFIs;  regulations  on  the \ndevelopment, maintenance, and use of funds in MFIs; and guidelines on reporting and statistical \nobligations (in conjunction with SBV). \n \n10.  In addition, SBV must establish systems and procedures for licensing MFIs and opening \naccounts at SBV for MFI legal capital and deposits. Furthermore, the following were prepared \n                                                 \n3  ADB.  2001.

While the new legal framework embodied in Decree No. 28 marks an improvement in the \nenabling environment, the Government recognizes the need to monitor the development of the \nsector resulting from the new framework and the possibility that future revisions to the decree \nmay be beneficial to promote microfinance development. There is, therefore, a need to develop \na framework for monitoring the impact of the new legal framework on sector development. \nCollectively, these tasks will require considerable technical inputs, systems development, and \nconsensus building to be accomplished within the time frame demanded by the decree. With the \nconstraints and difficulties faced by SBV, the Government, and microfinance practitioners to \ncarry out their respective obligations, technical assistance is required. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  TA  will  help  develop  a  sound  regulatory  and  supervisory  environment  for  the \nmicrofinance sector that encourages market-oriented, financially self-sustainable MFIs that can \ncontribute to poverty reduction and the country\u2019s economic growth and prosperity. The TA will \nassist  the  Government  to  implement,  monitor,  and  review  the  regulatory  and  supervisory \nframework embodied in Decree No. 28. Key outputs will include (i) the various legal documents \n(e.g.,  guidelines,  regulations,  circulars,  etc.)  to  be  issued  per  the  decree;  (ii)  revised,  as \nappropriate,  supervisory  manuals  and  procedures  that  are  consistent  with  the  decree;  (iii) \nimproved capacity of SBV staff to carry out their duties and responsibilities to regulate and \nsupervise microfinance; (iv) improved knowledge of microfinance practitioners regarding their \nresponsibilities under the new decree and the various legal documents to be issued; and (v) a \nframework for monitoring the development of the sector. The design and monitoring framework \nis presented in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  Building on work completed in TA 3741-VIE (footnote 3), the TA will (i) assist SBV and \nMOF  to  prepare  the  various  legal  documents  (e.g.,  guidelines,  regulations,  circulars,  etc.) \nrequired by Decree No. 28 (see paras. 8-9 for examples) and to revise supervisory manuals and \nprocedures to be consistent with the decree; (ii) conduct participatory workshops with key \nstakeholders, including mass organizations and international development agencies, to seek \ntheir views on TA activities and draft outputs and to disseminate knowledge on final outputs; (iii) \norganize smaller roundtable discussions with key stakeholders as needed; (iv) sponsor for SBV \nbranch staff and other local officials two study tours to two developing member countries where \nmicrofinance legal and supervisory systems are in place (Appendix 2 gives study tour details); \n(v) train SBV staff to implement the new framework, including regulations, guidelines, and \ninstructions issued; and (vi) prepare a framework for monitoring sector development with a view \nto future improvements to the policy and legal framework that will promote further development \n                                                 \n4  It is not expected that significant revisions will be needed, but there remains a need to review these procedures, \nmanuals, etc., to ensure consistency with the new framework. ", "4     \n \nof microfinance. SBV will also undertake to launch the microfinance website developed under \nTA  3741-VIE  (footnote  3)  so  it  can  be  used  to  disseminate  information  on  the  decree, \nregulations, and microfinance best practice.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  $315,000  equivalent,  comprising  $172,000  in  foreign \nexchange and $143,000 in local currency. ADB will finance $250,000 equivalent including all \nforeign exchange costs and $78,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment will provide the balance of the local currency costs of $65,000 equivalent by \nproviding counterpart services including (i) staff; (ii) office space for consultants during the TA; \n(iii) secretarial and coordinating services; (iv) translation and interpretation services other than \nfor workshops, seminars, reports, and training materials; and (v) part of the training costs, \nincluding transportation and accommodation for government officials. Detailed cost estimates \nand the proposed financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  SBV will be the Executing Agency. SBV will form a TA steering committee headed by the \ndeputy governor and comprising representatives from concerned departments of SBV. The \ncommittee  will  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  between  consultants  and  relevant \nagencies and for ensuring logistic support. SBV will cooperate with MOF, Ministry of Planning \nand Investment, Ministry of Labor Invalids and Social Affairs, and other ministries according to \ntheir respective functions and duties in preparing the various legal documents (e.g., guidelines, \nregulations, circulars, etc.) to implement Decree No. 28. SBV has also created a working group \nto undertake all work related to implementing Decree No. 28.  The consultants will work closely \nwith the working group. SBV will assign at least two counterpart staff for the TA. After the \ncompletion of the TA, follow-up duties will be assigned to SBV departments in accordance with \ntheir functions. Equipment from TA 3741-VIE and/or TA 3568-VIE: Rural Business Support 5 will \nbe allocated for use in this TA. \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 1 year beginning in September 2005 and ending in \nSeptember 2006. SBV will organize three tripartite review meetings involving the Government, \nthe TA consultant, and ADB during the TA period in conjunction with ADB missions to review \nthe progress of implementation and to resolve any outstanding issues. The meetings will be \nchaired  by  the  deputy  governor  of  SBV  or  a  person  designated  by  the  deputy  governor. \nMembers of the steering committee and working group and representatives of other agencies as \ndecided by SBV will attend the meetings. A counterpart staff will act as member secretary at \nmeetings. \n \n17.  The TA will require 7.5 person-months of consulting services:  4.0 international and 3.5 \ndomestic.  International  consultants  (person-months  are  in  parentheses)  will  include  a \nmicrofinance specialist who will also act as team leader (1.5), a microfinance legal specialist \n(1.0) and a microfinance supervision specialist (1.5). The domestic consultants will include a \nmicrofinance specialist and deputy team leader (2.0), and an accounting specialist (1.5). The \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.  \n \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2000.

Under the technical assistance (TA), two study tours, each with about 10 persons, will be \norganized to two developing member countries in the region where microfinance legal and \nsupervisory  systems  are  in  place.  Likely  destinations  will  be  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  and/or \nPhilippines, all of which have strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks and well-developed \nmicrofinance sectors. \n \n2.  The study tour participants will be chosen among (i) staff in local branches of State Bank \nof Vietnam (SBV) that will conduct microfinance supervision at the local level, and (ii) other local \nofficials (e.g., members of the local People's Committees) responsible for carrying out duties \nunder the new microfinance legal, regulatory, and supervisory regimes. Similar study tours were \nprovided under TA 3741-VIE1 to officials from the central Government and SBV\u2019s head office in \nHanoi, resulting in increased understanding of microfinance best practice at that level. However, \nsuch understanding at the local level is limited.  Under the new legal regime for microfinance, \nstaff in local SBV branches will be responsible both for licensing microfinance institutions (MFIs) \nand for supervising MFIs that fall under the prudential supervision regime. Moreover, per Prime \nMinister\u2019s Decree No. 28/2005/ND-CP (Decree No. 28) on the Organization and Operation of \nMicrofinance Institutions in Viet Nam, receiving an opinion from the local People's Committee in \nregard to the necessity of MFI establishment in the area is a condition for issuing an operations \nlicense to an MFI. Decree No. 28 also gives local People\u2019s Committees the responsibility for \nissuing  establishment  licenses  to  MFIs.  It  is  therefore  important  that  local  SBV  staff  and \nmembers  of  local  People\u2019s Committees have increased exposure to and understanding of \nmicrofinance principles and best practice. Such understanding is also expected to increase \nsupport for market-oriented microfinance at the local level. \n \n3.  The TA consultants will prepare and organize the study tours, giving detailed objectives, \nprograms, and budget for each study tour. Proposals for study tours will be submitted to the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) at least 6 weeks in advance for review and approval. Study \ntour participants will be nominated by SBV at least 1 month before the study tour is scheduled to \nbegin, and all nominations will be subject to ADB approval. Within 1 month of the end of the \nstudy tour, each participant will be required individually to (i) submit to their local organizations \nand to SBV\u2019s head office a study tour report including, but not necessarily limited to, the topics \ncovered, the key issues raised and their relevance to Viet Nam, and main lessons learned; and \n(ii)  give  an  oral  presentation  of  their  report  to  their  colleagues  in  their  respective  local \norganizations. SBV will provide ADB with copies of all such reports. \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.
