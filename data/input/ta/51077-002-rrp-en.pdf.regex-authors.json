THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto  the  Republic  of  Maldives  for  the  Greater  Mal\u00e9  Environmental  Improvement  and  Waste \nManagement Project.1 The report also describes (i) a proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nStrengthening Capacity for Sustainable Solid Waste Management in the Greater Mal\u00e9 Region \nand (ii) the proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction (JFPR), and if the Board approves the proposed grant, I, acting under the authority \ndelegated to me by the Board, approve the TA and the administration of the JFPR grant. \n \n2.  The project will establish a sustainable solid waste management (SWM) system in the \nGreater Mal\u00e9 capital region and its inhabited outer islands by (i) establishing a modern waste \ncollection, transfer, and disposal system; (ii) improving community-based outer island waste \nmanagement systems; (iii) building institutional capacity for sustainable services delivery; and \n(iv) raising  public  awareness  on  reduce,  reuse,  and  recycle  (3R)  behaviors. Physical  and \nnonphysical investments are designed to curb climate change and disaster impacts while creating \na cleaner environment in Maldives, one of the world\u2019s lowest-lying nations.2 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Greater Mal\u00e9 capital region and its outer islands suffer from severe environmental \npollution and deteriorating livability because of the inadequate collection and haphazard disposal \nof solid waste. The project area encompasses the 35 inhabited islands of the Alifu Alifu Atolli, Alifu \nDhaalu Atoll, Kaafu Atoll, and Vaavu Atoll, including the capital city of Mal\u00e9, with a total population \nof 216,000 (51% of Maldives). Open dumping and burning of garbage at the 30-year-old, 10-\nhectare dumpsite on Thilafushi Island (6 kilometers from Mal\u00e9) creates an environmental and \npublic  health  hazard.  Plumes  of  smoke  visible  from  Mal\u00e9,  the  international  airport,  and \nsurrounding resorts compromise air quality and pose a daily nuisance to residents and tourists, \nwhile toxic leachate contaminates soil and groundwater. Greater Mal\u00e9 and its inhabited outer \nislands lack an organized and sustainable waste management system for the 774 tons per day \n(tpd) of mixed solid waste they generate.3 Because of rapid urbanization and tourism development \nin the region, waste generation is expected to grow to 924 tpd by 2022 (footnote 3). The increasing \npressure on an already stressed waste management system poses a significant threat to tourism \nand  fisheries,  both  of  which  rely  heavily  on  the  country\u2019s  pristine  environment  and  are \ncornerstones  to  Maldives\u2019  economy.4  Poor  communities  on  the  outer  islands  suffer  from \naccumulated garbage as they have limited awareness and capacity to manage solid waste \neffectively.  \n \n4.  Existing waste collection, transfer, and disposal system. High population density and \nnarrow streets present unique challenges for waste collection in Mal\u00e9. Created in 2015, Waste \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Maldives, 2018\u20132020. Manila.  \n2  ADB. 2017.

Appendix 3 (Project Preparatory Technical \nAssistance). Manila. \n3  Sector Assessment (Summary): Water Supply and Other Municipal Infrastructure Services (accessible from the list \nof linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n4  A quarter of the country\u2019s employment is in tourism and fisheries. Tourism accounts for 30% of gross domestic \nproduct and is expected to expand in the project area.

Mal\u00e9. \n ", "2 \nManagement Corporation Limited (WAMCO) is the state-owned operator charged with collecting \nand transporting waste, as well as managing the regional waste management facilities throughout \nthe country. Waste collection in the outer islands is the responsibility of island councils not \nWAMCO. WAMCO has limited professional experience in modern and efficient waste collection \nsystems, and this lack of technical and managerial skills undermines their performance (footnote \n3). While WAMCO is trying to improve collection, the company receives nearly 150 complaints \nper day (as of September 2017) for non-collection of waste. Its collection equipment includes a \nfleet of aging vehicles unable to access narrow streets. WAMCO does not have uniform refuse \nbins  or  formal  transfer  stations.  Waste  is  transported  to  Thilafushi  Island  in  open,  non-\ncontainerized vessels, resulting in significant spillage into the ocean.5 Since 2008, fires have been \ndeliberately set at the dumpsite to reduce growing mounds. The equipment and logistics at the \nsite are inadequate to manage incoming waste efficiently and maximize the use of limited space. \nConstruction  and  demolition  waste  and  end-of-life  vehicles  (ELVs)  are  not  collected  and \nprocessed  separately.  Household  surveys  in  the  project  area  show  high  demand  for  3R \nawareness and education programs. About half of household respondents to a socioeconomic \nsurvey, conducted as part of the project preparatory TA, highlighted the need for more 3R \nawareness and the importance of education. \n \n5.  Climate change and disaster risks. At 1.5 meters above mean sea level, Maldives is \nvulnerable to sea level rise. Natural hazards such as extreme rainfall and severe storms are \nprojected to increase because of climate change, posing a risk to infrastructure and operations. \nThe Indian Ocean tsunami in December 2004 dispersed about 290,000 cubic meters of waste \nfrom open dumpsites on land, including municipal and hazardous waste such as asbestos, \nmedical waste, and oil.6 Therefore, the project design needs to include measures to protect \nsystems from natural hazards and climate change.7 \n \n6.  Policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  for  waste  management.  The \nPresident\u2019s 2013 manifesto calls for improvement in waste management in the Greater Mal\u00e9 \narea.8  The  National  Solid  Waste  Management  Policy  outlines  the  principles  to  improve \nenvironmental  quality.  A  proposed  solid  waste  management  act  would  set  the  legal  and \ninstitutional framework for the industry. The project is fully aligned with the national policy and \nregulations.  The  Waste  Management  and  Pollution  Control  Department  in  the  Ministry  of \nEnvironment and Energy (MEE) is mandated to ensure safe waste disposal on all inhabited \nislands.  The  MEE  works  closely  with  development  partners  to  develop  its  regional  waste \nmanagement systems,9 and selected the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to cover the project \narea because of the bank\u2019s industry experience and the project\u2019s link to ADB\u2019s TA for formulating \na development strategy for Greater Mal\u00e9.10 \n \n                                                \n5  Government of Maldives, Ministry of Environment and Energy. 2016.

Greater Mal\u00e9 development strategy. As part of its national strategy to achieve efficient \npublic spending on economic and social services, the government aims for 70% of its total \npopulation to live in Greater Mal\u00e9.11 The plan seeks to create spatial agglomeration and economic \nopportunities for faster growth and poverty reduction. Most of the population increase is expected \nto be absorbed in the newly developed island of Hulhumal\u00e9. Waste management systems are not \ncurrently equipped to handle this projected growth. \n \n8.  Value added by ADB assistance. The following lessons and value additions were \nincorporated in the project design:12 (i) use a phased approach to match implementation capacity \n\u2014a follow-on ADB project to develop a waste-to-energy plant as a long-term treatment solution \nconsistent with the comprehensive waste management strategy13 for the project area is planned \nfor approval in 2019 or 2020;14 (ii) develop high project readiness; (iii) include technical capacity \nbuilding for procurement, contract management, safeguards, and operation and maintenance \n(O&M); (iv) ensure strong community consultation and capacity building targeting women;15 and \n(v) incorporate disaster risk reduction and climate change-resilient measures in project designs.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The project is aligned with the following impact: a healthy living environment created in \nthe Greater Mal\u00e9 capital region and its outer islands (footnote 8). The project will have the \nfollowing outcome: climate- and disaster-resilient SWM services improved.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project will have three outputs. \n \n11.  Output 1: Waste collection, transfer, and disposal systems improved and made \nclimate and disaster resilient. This output will include (i) an efficient waste collection strategy \ndesigned and applied in Mal\u00e9 and Hulhumal\u00e9, in consultation with local communities, targeting \nwomen; (ii) waste collection and transport equipment, such as trucks, bins, and containers, \nprovided  for  Mal\u00e9,  Hulhumal\u00e9,  and  Villimal\u00e9;  (iii)  transfer  stations  in  Mal\u00e9  and  Villimal\u00e9 \nconstructed,  and  transfer  station  in  Hulhumal\u00e9  designed  as  land  is  not  yet  confirmed; \n(iv) construction  and  demolition  waste  processing  plant  and  ELV  dismantling  workshop \nconstructed; (v) waste vessel harbor at Thilafushi rehabilitated; (vi) three vessels for waste \ntransport from the outer islands to Thilafushi provided; (vii) heavy equipment, such as bulldozers, \nexcavators, and roll trucks, provided for controlled dumpsite management at Thilafushi; and \n(viii) two administrative buildings for WAMCO at the Mal\u00e9 transfer station and the Thilafushi waste \nvessel harbor constructed. All facilities will adopt climate-change and disaster-resilient design \nfeatures including enhanced engineering designs such as strengthened seawalls, raised floor \nelevations,  and  enhanced  drainage  systems;  and  soft  interventions,  such  as  disaster  and \nemergency planning and awareness building.  \n                                                \n11 The government did not specify a period for achieving this target but estimated it would take 15\u201320 years.  \n12 Independent Evaluation Department. 2011.

This output will provide comprehensive support to strengthen \nsustainable SWM in the 32 poor outer island communities of the project area. It will include (i) at \nleast 22 island waste management centers (IWMCs), of which 11 will be supported by JFPR grant, \ndeveloped or upgraded with processing equipment (balers, glass crushers, metal presses) in \nconsultation with the community, targeting women and incorporating climate and disaster-risk \nmeasures;17 (ii) collection equipment for the 32 outer islands (bins, refuse collection vehicles, \ndump trucks) provided; (iii) capacity building of eligible island councils targeting women in waste \ncollection,  segregation,  composting,  recycling,  and  O&M  undertaken;  and  (iv)  community \nawareness and behavior change campaigns in 3R targeting women in all outer islands delivered. \nAs subprojects under output 2 will be prepared after Board approval, each island is required to \nmeet minimum eligibility and selection criteria, including safeguards, to receive IWMC support \nunder the project. The criteria, which are intended to ensure sustainability, are outlined in the \nproject  administration  manual  (PAM).18  Subprojects  with  resettlement  impacts  will  not  be \nincluded.  Output 2 will be partially funded by a JFPR grant, which will support (i) the construction \nof IWMCs on at least 11 eligible islands, (ii) the provision of skills and capacity building to women \non eligible islands, and (iii) the delivery of 3R awareness campaigns on all the 32 outer islands. \nThe PAM outlines additional selection criteria for JFPR supported islands. \n \n13.  Output  3:  Institutional  capacity  and  public  awareness  in  sustainable  waste \nmanagement strengthened. This will include (i) capacity building support in sustainable SWM \nservice delivery and disaster risk management provided to eligible WAMCO staff (at least 70% \neligible women staff); (ii) public awareness and behavior change campaigns in 3R delivered, \ntargeting the poor and women in Greater Mal\u00e9; and (iii) project management, design, and \nsupervision consultant support provided. Capacity building activities in disaster risk management \nwill include the preparation of an SWM disaster action plan outlining prevention, preparedness, \nresponse, and recovery tasks. Disaster risk management awareness activities will involve first \nresponders, such as police and firefighters, in Thilafushi. A public awareness and community \ncapacity building consultant recruited by the PMU will implement public awareness and behavior \nchange activities in outer islands (under outputs 2) and Greater Mal\u00e9 (under output 3). \n \nD.

The economic rationale for government intervention is sound as the \nproject aims to provide sustainable SWM services in the Greater Mal\u00e9 capital region and its outer \ninhabited islands. The project\u2019s estimated economic internal rate of return is 17.5%, higher than \nthe economic opportunity cost of capital estimated at 9.0%, indicating significant economic \nreturns. The sensitivity analysis also revealed satisfactory results, except under the scenario of \nall downside risks occurring together, i.e., (i) a 20% capital cost overrun, (ii) a 20% overrun in \nO&M costs, (iii) a 20% decline in estimated benefits, and (iv) a 1-year delay in implementation.20 \n \n22.  Financial analysis. The transaction TA (footnote 2) conducted a financial analysis for the \nproject to determine whether it is sustainable and the extent to which it will generate revenues to \ncover O&M costs. The results showed the project would generate sufficient revenues to cover full \nO&M costs provided WAMCO implements regular tariff revisions. The financial performance of \nWAMCO  shows  it  has  substantially  depended  on  government  grants.  Thus,  the  financial \nprojections of WAMCO and the island councils demonstrate the revenue account will remain in \nsurplus  by  (i)  rationalizing  tariffs,  (ii)  improving  collection  efficiency,  and  (iii)  continuing \ngovernment support. \n \nC.  Governance \n23.  Financial management. The financial management assessment concludes the MEE can \nconduct adequate financial management of the project. The MEE has experience in handling \nlarge  projects  funded  internally  and  externally  (footnote  3).  In  addition,  the  MEE  has  an \nestablished legal, institutional, and monitoring framework available for budgeting, accounting, and \nauditing. Thus, the overall financial management risk for the project is moderate. The project \ndesign includes the following risk mitigation measures: (i) commitment of the MOFT and the MEE \nto ensure the timely setup of the PMU with qualified staff, and (ii) commitment from the MOFT \nand the MEE for timely allocation and disbursement of the government\u2019s counterpart funds. The \nprogram will provide further support to improve the financial management capacity of the MEE \nand the PMU. \n \n24.  Procurement. Procurement of civil works and goods will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2015, as amended from time to time). The recruitment of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). A procurement \ncapacity assessment concluded the overall procurement risk for the project is moderate. The MEE \nhas extensive experience in development partner-supported procurement of goods and works. A \nprocurement  expert recruited  under  the  attached TA  will  provide  additional  implementation \nsupport for the MEE. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nand  discussed  with  the  government  and  the  MOFT.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote18). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n25.  Overall poverty in Maldives is estimated at 15% (2010), but poverty levels in Mal\u00e9 \nincreased from 4% in 2003 to 12% in 2010 due to migration of unskilled workers from the outer \natolls.21 The project includes improved waste management for poor outer island communities, \nincluding skills training and awareness and behaviour change campaigns. The project will result \nin a cleaner environment that will have a positive impact on fishing and tourism-based livelihoods, \nwhich many of the poor depend on. \n \n26.  Gender. The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming. The gender benefits of \nthe project include (i) participation of women in community-based waste management activities \nin poor outer island communities, (ii) capacity building on gender for project stakeholders, \n(iii) promotion of equitable access to project-related jobs, and (iv) equal opportunity employment \nacross positions in WAMCO. The MEE endorsed a gender action plan with clear targets, \nresponsibilities,  and  resource  allocations  for  the  participation  of  women.22  The  PMU  will \nimplement the gender action plan with support from public awareness and community capacity \nbuilding consultants recruited under the project, and the JFPR grant coordinator. The information, \neducation, and communication specialist in the PMU will serve as the gender focal point to support \ntimely and effective implementation of the gender action plan (footnote 22). \n \nE.  Safeguards \n27.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.23 \n \n28.  Environment  (category  B).  The  MEE  prepared  three  draft  initial  environmental \nexaminations24 with environmental management plans for subprojects requiring civil works: (i) \ntransfer stations in Mal\u00e9 and Villimal\u00e9; (ii) construction and demolition waste processing plant, \nELV dismantling workshop, and waste vessel harbor rehabilitation; and (iii) a sample IWMC. All \nproject locations are outside sensitive areas and impacts will be avoided or mitigated through \nmeasures  identified  in  the  environmental  management  plans.  The  MEE  conducted  public \nconsultations that will continue throughout implementation. The MEE prepared an environmental \nassessment and review framework for output 2, including site selection and design criteria. No \ncategory A projects are allowed.25 The environmental assessment and review framework and the \ninitial environmental examinations were disclosed on the websites of ADB and the MEE and will \nbe available in the local language. The PMU will handle safeguards-related grievances following \nthe project-specific grievance redress mechanism for the project. While the MEE developed \nsafeguards capacity from other development partner-supported projects, the PMU will receive \n                                                \n21 Government of Maldives, Ministry of Finance and Treasury, Department of National Planning. 2010.

The MEE prepared a due diligence report, which \nfound no permanent or temporary resettlement impacts occurring from the project as all works \nare proposed within available government lands. For output 2, the selection criteria outlined in the \nPAM (footnote 18) require no resettlement impacts as an eligibility criterion for project support; a \nresettlement framework has been prepared to guide appraisal and implementation.26 The MEE \nhas  sufficient  capacity  to  monitor  safeguards  compliance  from  its  experience  in  similar \ndevelopment partner-funded projects. Dedicated PMU safeguards staff and consultants will \nsupport the MEE. \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category C). There are no indigenous people communities present \nat or around the subproject sites. \n \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n31.
