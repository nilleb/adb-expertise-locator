INTRODUCTION \n1.   In response to the request from the Government of Cambodia, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) included a technical assistance (TA) project in its country operations business plan, \n2017\u20132019.1 The  TA  will  strengthen  government  capacity  for  improved  implementation  of \nexternally funded projects and improve the effectiveness and results of development interventions \nin Cambodia2. Improved management of development projects will support the government\u2019s \nongoing reform efforts in public financial management and enhance good governance in the \npublic sector. During the TA fact-finding mission, conducted in February 2017, the government \nconcurred  with  the  impact,  outcomes,  implementing  arrangements,  costs  and  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.    The demand for public investments in Cambodia has increased in line with Cambodia\u2019s \nrapid economic growth, which averaged 7% per year from 2000 to 2015. External financing \nthrough official development assistance has played a large role in filling this gap, providing about \ntwo-thirds of the government\u2019s annual development budget.4 With the expansion of development \nassistance, government is under pressure to deliver quality results quickly. This, in turn, requires \na  sound  and  sustainable  operational  system  that  reinforces  good  governance  in  project \nmanagement.  Since  2004,  development  partners  provided  assistance  and  support  to  the \ngovernment to address financial and human capacity constraints to achieving its development \nobjectives.  However,  these  efforts  have  mostly  been  fragmented  and  project-based  and, \ntherefore, their impacts on the overall implementation of externally funded projects have been \nlimited.5   \n \n3.  Despite risk mitigation measures built in externally funded projects, project implementation \nrisk remains high due to weak operational and management capacity, which is reflected in the \noverall portfolio performance (e.g., disbursement ratios, project start-up compliance, and loan \nextensions). Implementation is constrained by poor construction industry standards and a limited \nnumber of qualified service providers (e.g., consultants, contractors, and suppliers in the market). \nUnderlying  these  constraints  are  systemic  issues  such  as  the  limited  ownership  and \nunsatisfactory  supervision  of  projects,  limited  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies, and lengthy procedures in the approval of project documents.    \n \n4.  With  assistance  from  the  World  Bank,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners,  the \ngovernment adopted the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for externally funded projects to \nalign  project  management,  procurement,  and  financial  management  with  international \npractices\u2014a milestone achieved in 2012.6 While the framework for project implementation has \nbeen established, the quality of investments throughout the project cycle needs improvement.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2016.

The TA will build on past efforts to improve project implementation and build the capacity \nof the executing and implementing agencies in the areas of project management, procurement, \nfinancial management, governance, and gender mainstreaming. In addressing the issue of the \ncapacity of the executing and implementing agencies and other systemic issues, the TA will carry \nout  an  assessment  of  binding  constraints  to  effective  implementation  to  identify  long-term \nsolutions. This will require (i) improved mechanisms to ensure project preparation, readiness, and \nimplementation through effective project readiness filters and advance actions; (ii) strengthened \nand sustainable implementation capacity of the executing and implementing agencies, including \nthe  possibility  of  partnering  with  national training  institutions for  long-term  and  sustainable \ncapacity building; and (iii) strategic, coordinated, and effective knowledge management, which \nincludes, but is not limited to, diagnostic studies that address systemic issues underpinning \nportfolio performance as well as thematic issues that affect project quality (e.g., governance and \ngender mainstreaming). The knowledge base derived from these activities will be used as a basis \nfor further policy dialogue with the government.  \n  \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n6.  The government\u2019s National Strategic Development Plan, 2014\u20132018 focuses on the \npromotion  of  agriculture,  physical  infrastructure,  private  sector  development,  and  human \nresources underpinned by a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework.7 In ensuring \neffective and sustained public investments, the government since 2015 has been developing its \npublic investment management strategy, which will be supported by three subdecrees\u2013one of \nwhich will cover guidelines and procedures for externally funded projects.8  \n \n7.  The country partnership and strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Cambodia emphasizes two strategic \npillars: strengthening of rural\u2013urban\u2013regional linkages and human resource development, and \nstrengthening public sector management.9 To achieve these, it is imperative that investments are \nresults-based and that projects deliver their intended outcomes. The TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020 Midterm Review Action Plan in terms of improving operational efficiencies, preparing \nprojects better, improving project readiness, and facilitating organizational change to meet new \nchallenges,  particularly  in  light  of  greater  empowerment  to  resident  missions  in  portfolio \nmanagement and project implementation.10  \n \n8.  Previous TA projects on enhancing project implementation and strengthening country \nsystems have led to some capacity improvements of the executing and implementing agencies in \nthe  areas  of  project  administration,  procurement,  and  financial  management,  following  the \ngovernment\u2019s promulgation of the SOPs. The TA projects provided support in operationalizing the \nsubdecree, conducted training programs, and produced a cadre of trainers in procurement and \nfinancial management. However, the outreach of these capacity building programs has been \nrather limited and the effectiveness of these programs has been uneven; as well, the utilization of \ngood  implementation  practices  has  been  limited  and  will  need  greater  attention.  The  TA, \ntherefore, builds on results from the previous related interventions, utilizes the trainers trained \n                                                \nSOP). Upon the promulgation of the SOPs in 2012, ADB and the World Bank acknowledged the SOPs are consistent \nwith their guidelines. \n7  Government of Cambodia. 2012.

The expected impact will be the promotion of an effective and sustainable development \nusing  external  resources,  which  is  aligned  with  Cambodia\u2019s  Development  Cooperation  & \nPartnerships Strategy, 2014\u20132018.11 The expected outcome will be improved implementation of \nexternally funded projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA outputs are the following: \n \n(i)  Mechanisms  for  project  preparation,  readiness,  and  implementation \nimproved. This output will address systemic weaknesses in project preparation, \nstart-up, and implementation. As new international practices have evolved, the \ngovernment will review and update the contents of the SOPs for externally funded \nprojects, taking into account the institutional and human capacity of the executing \nand implementing agencies. The project team will revisit project readiness filters \nand advance actions to accelerate project start-up time and take into account \nexisting  government  regulations  for  the  detailed  step-by-step  implementing \nguidelines.  Government  chart  of  accounts  will  be  mainstreamed  in  project \naccounts of externally funded projects. The project team will acquire and configure \nneeded  accounting  software  and  provide  training  for  the  executing  and \nimplementing agencies. The project team will also review current institutional \nmechanisms for project implementation (e.g., project management unit structure, \nreporting lines, and roles and responsibilities of various government stakeholders \ninvolved  at  various  stages  of  the  project  cycle)  along  with  implementation \nprocesses and procedures, and provide recommendations for improvement.  \n \n(ii)   Implementation  capacity  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies \nstrengthened and sustained. This output will address long-term capacity needs \nof the government in managing externally funded projects. The project team will \nconduct a capacity needs assessment at the national and subnational levels and \ndevelop training programs to build the capacity of the executing and implementing \nagencies. The training programs will focus on procurement, financial management, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  inclusive  development/gender  mainstreaming,  and \nother aspects relating to project management, incorporating the requirements of \nthe SOPs and ADB financial management guidelines. The project team will further \nexplore the possibility of partnering with national training institutions for long-term \nsustainability of capacity building efforts. About 400 executing and implementing \nagency staff at both the national and subnational levels will be trained. Through \nthe TA, the project team will develop a training of trainers program to create a pool \nof 20 qualified trainers, link TA activities with the government and development \npartner programs, and institutionalize results with the national training institution. \n                                                \n11 Government of Cambodia, Cambodian Rehabilitation and Development Board Council for the Development of \nCambodia. 2013. Development Cooperation & Partnerships Strategy, 2014\u20132018. Phnom Penh.  \n \n ", "4 \n \n(iii)  Strategic and effective knowledge management improved. The project team \nwill  (a)  conduct  an  in-depth,  evidence-based  diagnostic  study  to  address \nconstraints to portfolio performance (e.g., project ownership by the government \nstaff  and  beneficiaries,  transparency  and  accountability,  monitoring, \nmainstreaming of cross-cutting aspects in project design, and performance of the \nlocal supply market); (b) address key issues in project implementation; and (c) \nprovide  recommendations  to  improve  portfolio  performance  and  project \nimplementation. The TA will support strategic, coordinated, and more focused and \neffective knowledge management through (a) identification, documentation, and \ndissemination  of  good  project  implementation  practices  for  improved  project \nmanagement  and  investment  programming;  (b)  generation  of  strategic  and \ndemand-driven  knowledge  products  and  solutions  to  enhance  development \neffectiveness;  (c)  support  for  knowledge  partnerships  with  the  government, \nresearch institutes, development partners, and civil society organizations; and (d) \nconduct of periodical portfolio reviews in collaboration with the government and \ndevelopment partners. \n \n11.  The TA may encounter risks\u2013lack of commitment to mainstream TA recommendations \nand difficulties in interagency coordination. To mitigate these risks, the project team will ensure \nthorough consultation with key stakeholders and disseminate its findings and recommendations \nwidely. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which $1,400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of office space and travel of the counterpart staff. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Ministry of Economy and Finance will be the executing agency. The ministry will (i) \nwork closely with relevant line ministries to assess underlying issues regarding project readiness, \npreparation, and implementation; (ii) assess capacity building needs and develop the necessary \ntraining programs; (iii) work with a consulting firm, individual consultants and national training \ninstitutions  to  improve  project  implementation  and  portfolio  performance;  and  (iv)  ensure \nconsistency  with  government  training  programs.  ADB\u2019s  Cambodia  Resident  Mission  will \nadminister the TA. The TA is scheduled to be implemented over 24 months, from 1 May 2017 to \n30 April 2019.  \n \n14.  The TA project is estimated to require 25 person-months of international consultants and \n80 person-months of national consultant inputs. The TA will engage a consulting firm and \nindividual consultants. ADB will recruit the international consulting firm using the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. Individual consultants will be \nselected through the individual consultant selection method.12 Consultant selection will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).13 The TA will engage national training institutes through knowledge partnerships.

Overview \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will engage one consulting firm, individual consultants, and \nnational training institutions. Upon mobilization of the individual consultants, an international \nconsulting firm will be recruited using the quality- and cost-based selection method with a quality\u2013\ncost ratio of 90:10. It will be responsible for conducting a capacity needs assessment of executing \nand implementing agencies and developing a long-term capacity building program, which includes \nthe appropriate methodology, estimation of the number of participants, and a timetable and work \nplan for the capacity building program. The consulting firm will work closely with individual \nconsultants for their inputs and, later on, with the selected national training institutes that will \ndeliver the training programs.  \n \n2.
