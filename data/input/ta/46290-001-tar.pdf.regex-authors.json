INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government  of  Bangladesh requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to support the development of a strong base of skilled labor force to \nmatch rapid economic growth. 1 Success in implementing reforms in large systems such as the \nBangladesh  education  and  skills  sectors  depends  on  government  agencies\u2019  management \ncapacity. Good governance is essential for effective program delivery to beneficiaries. The \nprimary aim of the TA is to help improve the central and local governments\u2019 fiduciary risk \nmanagement and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity in the education and skills sectors. \nGreater institutional capacity will lead to more efficient use of funds, and will lead to better \nperformance  in  these  sectors.  Consultation  and fact-finding missions were fielded  and  the \ngovernment and ADB reached an agreement on the design and implementation arrangements \nof the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Bangladesh  articulates  its  vision  to  achieve  middle-income  status  by  2021  in  the \nNational Perspective Plan.3 Development of human capital has become an urgent task for the \ngovernment  to  further  accelerate  economic  growth  and  reduce  poverty.  The  government \ncurrently  implements  its  own  sector  programs  through  the  Secondary  Education  Sector \nInvestment Program (SESIP)4 and Skills for Employment Investment Program (SEIP).5 These \nnational sector investment programs are also supported by development partners, including \nADB. With the vision to develop a sound education and skills sector system in the middle-\nincome country by 2021, the government uses the national system of financial management \nboth  under  SESIP  and  SEIP. 6 The  government  has  also  made  strong  commitment  in \nstrengthening the procurement system.  \n \n3.  Procurement. Education and skills sector programs require large numbers and several \ntypes of procurement. This includes different types of civil works (e.g., academic buildings, \nadministrative  buildings,  and  skills  training  workshops)  and  procurement  of  furniture  and \nequipment to be used for teaching and learning. Weak capacity leads to delays in delivery of \nprocured items to schools and training centers. The procurement capacity assessment for \nSESIP and SEIP showed that the extensive procurement reform under way since 2003 has \nimproved Bangladesh\u2019s procurement laws and procedures. One of the key developments is that \nthe  government\u2019s  e-procurement  initiative  has  been  successfully  introduced  in  SESIP \nimplementation. About 340 staff in the Ministry of Education (MOE), Directorate of Secondary \nand Higher Education, and co-implementing agencies have been trained. Operationalization of \ne-procurement is planned in 2015\u20132017 along with the Procurement Capacity Development \nPlan under MOE institutions. To improve the large system in education and skills sectors, the \ngovernment needs to further improve procurement practices and strengthen oversight to ensure \ncompliance with rules and procedures. \n                                                \n1  The proposed TA was included in Bangladesh\u2019s country operations business plan, 2013\u20132015. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 July 2015.  \n3  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Planning. 2012. National Perspective Plan (2010\u20132021). Dhaka. \n4  ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Secondary Education Sector Investment Program. \nManila. \n5  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Skills for Employment Investment Program. \nManila.  \n6  This is in contrast to other programs where government uses the development partners\u2019 financial management and \nprocedures and procurement guidelines.  \n ", "2   \n4.  Financial management. Financial management in education and skills sectors requires \nefficiency and effectiveness at field and central levels. Constraints are related to capacity to plan, \nmanage, implement, and monitor sector reform. The assessment presents that these are due to \nthe large scale of national education and skills sectors, their centralized management systems, \nand  weak  accountability.  The  assessment  also  showed  that  Bangladesh\u2019s  financial \nmanagement systems have been strengthened in recent years. The government\u2019s Integrated \nBudgeting and Accounting System (IBAS) has the capacity to generate financial reports. IBAS \nand its quality of reports are gradually gaining the trust of line ministries and development \npartners, and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) plans to strengthen IBAS in 2015. Measures have \nbeen identified to further mainstream good practices in financial management through improved \nbudget  execution  and  quality  of  financial  reporting,  and  capacity  development  of  the \ngovernment\u2019s internal audit function.  \n \n5.  The following are practical challenges in procurement and financial management (PFM) \nin  the  education  and  skills  sectors:  (i)  weak  capacity  in  preparing  budget  and  separate \ndevelopment and non-development budgets, (ii) large off-budget fiscal activities, (iii) little effort \nto mobilize revenues, (iv) limited performance reporting, (v) weak capacity in internal audit, (vi) \nneed  for  government  accounting  and  auditing  to  meet  international  standards,  and  (vii) \ninconsistent application of rules and the lack of standards in procurement practices (e.g., post-\nprocurement  review  is  set  in  the  government  regulations  but  not  conducted  regularly  and \nsystematically).7 The proposed TA to improve system capacity is therefore, critical. \n \n6.  Monitoring  and  evaluation.  The  government  has  moved  to  results-based  sector \nmanagement  and  planning.  However,  present  budget  formulation  and  preparation  of  the \nmedium-term budget framework forecasts are calculated as increments to the previous year\u2019s \nbudget allocation rather than on the basis of the resources required for achieving sector targets. \nThis results in imbalances in resource allocations between recurrent costs and investment costs. \nTo improve sector management, it is critical for central and local government officials to improve \ntheir capacity in M&E. The TA outputs such as data and analysis developed from the M&E \nsystem will improve sector planning and management. This will ensure effective use of funds for \nsector  development.  M&E  will  need  to  include  quantitative  aspects,  including  academic \nsupervision and study on quality and use of end-products (e.g., quality of science laboratory, \nstatus of use of science laboratory by students and teachers). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The impact will be more efficient and market-relevant secondary education and skills \ndevelopment systems. The outcome will be improved capacity in fiduciary management in PFM \nand M&E of the secondary education and skills subsectors.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The proposed TA will build on the outputs of the ongoing TA funded from Supporting \nEducation and Skills Development Investment Programs.8 These support similar activities of \nFY2013\u20132014 and FY2014\u20132015 of SESIP and SEIP. The proposed TA will support FY2015\u2013\n                                                \n7  Some of the challenges are common in other sectors.  \n8  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh: Supporting Education and Skills \nDevelopment Investment Programs. Manila. \n ", "  3 \n2016 and FY2016\u20132017. Incremental results from the ongoing and proposed TA will help the \ngovernment improve the large systems on PFM and M&E in the two sectors. Moreover, same \nefforts are being made in Bangladesh\u2019s primary education subsector through the Third Primary \nEducation Project\u2014its experiences will be used in the TA implementation. 9 \n \n9.  The following are the lessons from the past and ongoing interventions that are applied to \nthe TA design to produce the intended outcome: \n \n(i)  There is a strong need for a systematic approach to develop the capacity to plan, \nmanage,  implement,  and  monitor  sector  reforms.  The  scale  of  centralized \nmanagement and existing fragmentation complicate the accountability inherent \nunder the current sector management regime. \n \n(ii)  A system is being developed well with the measures provided in the PFM Action \nPlan, supported by targeted areas of actions to improve government capacity.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Fiduciary risk management initiatives implemented. Fiduciary reviews will \nidentify key areas of needs for capacity development in fiduciary risk management and practices \nin PFM. Recommendations of the fiduciary reviews will focus on short-term and medium-term \naction  plans  to  develop  institutional  capacity.  These  include  a  national  workshop  in  risk \nmanagement  in  sector-specific  areas  for  secondary  and  skills  development  agencies,  and \ntraining  workshops  for  stakeholders  in  zones  and  districts  that  have  weak  internal  control \ncapacity or have a large volume of transactions.  \n \n11.  Output 2:  Monitoring and evaluation initiatives, including results-based reporting, \nimplemented.  The  TA  will  build  the  capacity  of  M&E  of  secondary  education  and  skills \nsubsectors. Results-based management in education planning requires modern methodologies \nof monitoring and proper reporting. Quantitative and qualitative methods will be applied. This \noutput will build capacity of central, zone, district, and upazila (subdistrict) officials with support \nof consultants and training activities. \n \n12.  Output 3: Policy dialogue on system capacity development in procurement and \nfinancial management enhanced. Key areas of policy reforms will be identified during the joint \nsector review (JSR). The TA will support (i) workshops, seminars, and studies for knowledge \nsharing, policy reviews, and planning for institutional capacity development in PFM; (ii) results-\nbased planning, financing, and reporting; and (iii) other key areas that may be identified. \n \n13.  The TA will develop the government\u2019s institutional capacity and ownership, which will \nlead to enhanced sustainability. Long-term support, such as the multitranche financing facility \nmodality  for  the  two  programs  such  as  SESIP  and  SEIP,  also  allows  enhancing \ninstitutionalization  of  key  areas  such  as  internal  control  of  financial  management  and \nprocurement.  Agreed  actions  based  on  recommendations  of  the  fiduciary  reviews  will  be \nrecorded in the PFM action plan of the respective programs. Implementation of the PFM action \nplan is a key part of the program implementation of SESIP and SEIP. The activities of the \nSESIP and SEIP, together with the capacity development support provided by the TA, will lead \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2011.

Manila.  \n ", "4   \nto the whole system development to ensure soundness of the secondary education and skills \nsubsectors. \n \n14.  High turnover of staff and lack of political environment to improve system capacity are \nrisks that may undermine institutional capacity development. Close oversight by ADB and other \ndevelopment partners, through JSRs and extensive policy dialogue, would help to overcome \nsuch risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,575,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MOE is the executing agency for the secondary education subsector and MOF is the \nexecuting agency for the skills subsector. They will work closely with the Finance Division of \nMOF, which is responsible for national budget allocation and accounting, comptroller general of \naccounts, and comptroller and auditor general.  \n \n17.  The outline of the terms of reference (TOR) for consultants is in Appendix 3. Consultants \nwill be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). A firm will be engaged through quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod (80:20) with use of simplified technical proposal. The firm will provide 10 months of \ninternational and 40 months of national consulting inputs for financial audit and procurement \naudit. The consultants will undertake quarterly and annual fiduciary reviews (QFRs/AFRs) of \nSESIP  and  SEIP,  in  accordance  with  the TOR,  which  will  be  finalized  every  year  by  the \ngovernment and ADB.10 The AFR will review annual financial statements and conduct in-depth \nreview of specific fiduciary risk areas that are identified. The AFR includes a post-procurement \nreview.  The  consultants  will  prepare  recommendations  with  identified  areas  for  capacity \ndevelopment  which  will  be  discussed  and  agreed  by  the  government  and  ADB  for \nimplementation. In addition, ADB will engage individual international consultants for 8 person-\nmonths  and  national  consultants  for  15  person-months  to  support  capacity  building  of \ngovernment officials in M&E, and verification of quantitative and qualitative results of (i) science \neducation, (ii) information and communication technology in education, (iii) decentralization, and \n(iv) other technical areas in skills development areas as required. The TA will be implemented in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented from October 2015 to September 2017. It will be monitored \nperiodically  through  ADB\u2019s  review  missions,  a  review  of  consultants\u2019  reports,  and  the \nGovernment\u2013Development Partners\u2019 JSR. TA effectiveness will be evaluated by ADB, and \nadjustments  including  needs  of  consultancy  services  will  be  made  as  required,  in  close \nconsultations with the government. \n \n19.  The TA team will work closely with the Education Local Consultative Group and the \nThird Primary Education Development Project team.11 The Japan International Cooperation \n                                                \n10  Generic TORs of QFRs and AFRs are accessible in the SESIP and SEIP Facility Administration Manual. \n11  Procurement and Finance Working Group of the Third Primary Education Development Project. \n ", "  5 \nAgency  officials,  in  its  Bangladesh  office,  will  be  invited  as  resource  persons  to  the \ndissemination workshops of AFRs. Lessons and best practices will be disseminated through the \naide memoires of the JSR and the uploading of selected reports on the government\u2019s program \nwebsites. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Bangladesh to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Capacity Building of Management in Education and Skills Programs, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Project is Aligned with: \n \nMore  efficient  and  market-relevant  secondary  education  and  skills  development  systems  (Secondary \nEducation Sector Road Map and Skills Sector Road Map)a \n \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and   \n  with Targets and  Reporting   \nResults Chain  Baselines  Risks \nOutcome       \nCapacity in fiduciary  a.
