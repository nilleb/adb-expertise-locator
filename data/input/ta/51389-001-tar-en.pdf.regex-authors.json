The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the development of a \npolicy framework for a sustainable elderly care system in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nthrough analysis of international good practices on elderly care policies, analysis of domestic \nimplementation practices, and capacity building of central and local governments.  \n \n2.  The  TA 1  is  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan  for  the  PRC,  \n2018\u20132020.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC has the largest elderly population and is one of the most rapidly aging countries \nin the world. The population aged 65 years and above was 150 million in 2016.3 Further, the \nproportion of the population aged 65 years and above is estimated to increase more than 14% by \n20254 and will soon enter an \u201caged society.\u201d5 To address the rising needs of the elderly, the \ngovernment has taken actions to strengthen their social protection. The Twelfth Five-Year Plan, \n2011\u20132015 indicated the need to develop a three-tiered system of elderly care services,6 which \nhas further been supported under the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.7 \n \n4.  However, responses to the care needs are still limited. Available services are inadequate \nto meet the care needs of the elderly. Home-based delivery care and community-based day care \nare underdeveloped.8 The limited availability of home- and community-based care leads to an \noverreliance on residential care.9 Even for residential care, the availability of quality care is still \nlimited. Because of the lack of a standardized care needs assessment, elderly people who are \naccessing services might not necessarily need care, but just prefer having the care. Also, because \nof the lack of a standardized practical monitoring system, it is difficult to ensure the quality of \nservices. \n \n5.  Further, providing affordable elderly care services is a challenge. A critical bottleneck in \nproviding needed and affordable services is the shortage of skilled caregivers and care managers. \nOnly a limited number of training and educational institutions have integrated elderly-related \ncourses into their programs. In addition, a career development path remains unclear for workers \nin this sector, which makes it difficult to attract potential workers. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on \n2 August 2018. \n2  ADB. 2018.

New York. \n5  An aged society is defined as a country in which the ratio of the population aged 65 years and above to the total \npopulation is more than 14%.  \n6  These three tiers are home-based delivery care, community-based day care, and residential care. \n7  Government  of  the  PRC,  State  Council.  2010.

Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for \nNational Economic and Social Development, 2016\u20132020. Beijing. \n8 Home-based care delivers care services for the elderly at home. Community-based day care provides care services \nfor elderly individuals who come to a community elderly care center during the daytime. These home- and community-\nbased services enable family members to return to the labor market and/or enable elderly people without family \nmembers to receive needed care services at home or community elderly care centers. \n9  Residential care provides institutional care for elderly people who need care for daily living activities such as bathing \nand eating. If a residential institution has appropriate facilities and capacities, it could also provide rehabilitation and \nbasic health care services. \n ", "2 \n \n6.  Another challenge to providing affordable elderly care is limited financial sources. The    \nlevel of relevant subsidies is limited. In addition, the subsidies are mostly provided based on inputs \nsuch as the number of beds, while those provided on the basis of service and/or performance are \nseverely limited. Also, a model of long-term care insurance to be replicated across provinces and \ncities is yet to be established, although pilots of long-term care insurance have been implemented \nsince 2016.10 Considering the current average pension level in the PRC, it would not be realistic \nto fully rely on user charges to provide quality elderly care services.11  \n \n7.  A clear financial framework is yet to be established for the elderly care sector because of \ninsufficient financial sources and inadequate subsidies. Also, roles and responsibilities have not \nbeen clearly aligned between the public and the private sectors. Without a clear financial \nframework and responsibility alignment in the elderly care sector, it is difficult to design a \nsustainable business model. The private sector could potentially take a greater role in service \nprovision for the elderly care sector; however, this potential market has not been explored yet. \n \n8.  Adapting to a rapidly aging population will be a key for the PRC to attain inclusive growth. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported local governments in the PRC to develop \ntheir elderly care services since 2013.12 To further develop a standardized elderly care system in \nthe PRC, it is necessary to establish a policy framework of an overall elderly care system. Building \non the experiences of ADB support for PRC elderly care development, the TA will further help the \nGovernment of the PRC set up a policy framework of an elderly care system to adapt to the aging \npopulation. A focal area of ADB support is to help address development challenges in adapting \nto the aging population. The TA is also aligned with ADB\u2018s country partnership strategy for the \nPRC, 2016\u20132020 (the strategic pillar on inclusive economic growth); the Strategy 2030; and the \nOperational Plan for Health, 2015\u20132020, which includes elderly care as a focus area.13 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA  is  aligned  with  the following  impact: a  comprehensive  elderly  care  system \nresponding to care needs of the elderly in the PRC established.14 The TA will have the following \noutcome:  policy  framework  for  adequate  and  affordable  elderly  care  service  provision \ndeveloped.15 \n \n                                                \n10 Pilots of long-term care insurance have been conducted in 15 cities across different provinces in the PRC. \nGovernment of the PRC, Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. 2016. Guiding Opinion on the \nImplementation of the Long-Term Care Insurance. Beijing. \n11  The level of pension income varies across localities in the PRC. Based on the available data as of July 2018, for \nexample, the monthly average pension income was about CNY2,500 in Dalian City in 2016 and about CNY2,200 in \nNanning City of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in 2017. \n12 ADB. 2013.

Output 1 will \nfocus on four key issues to design a system and ensure the provision of adequate elderly care \nservices for those in need: (i) developing a three-tiered system of elderly care service provision, \ncovering the analysis of developing such systems in urban and rural areas; (ii) developing a care \nneeds assessment scheme to determine care needs and eligibility; (iii) setting practical service \nstandards and quality monitoring of the services; and (iv) integrating elderly care and medical \ncare.  \n \n11.  Output 2: Policy framework for affordable elderly care service provision identified. \nOutput 2 will focus on two key resources to deliver affordable elderly care services\u2014financial \nsources and human resources\u2014targeting the regular pensioners.16 Policy recommendations will \nbe made on (i) establishing a multi-pillar elderly care financial system through analyzing the \ndesign and level of appropriate subsidies, as well as the analysis of developing such systems in \nurban and rural areas; (ii) designing a possible long-term care insurance program for the PRC; \n(iii) exploring other potential funding sources for elderly care; (iv) preparing a strategy on human \nresource development for the next 10\u201320 years through analyzing the types and scale of human \nresources needed in the elderly care sector, as well as examining means to leverage experts and \nresources available in the private sector to fill the supply gap; (v) identifying education and training \nsystems for needed human resources; and (vi) developing a career development strategy in the \nsector.17 \n \n12.  Output 3: A model of elderly care industry development improved. Output 3 will \nsupport the development of a market to enhance the involvement of private sector, including civil \nsociety organizations and nonprofit organizations. Based on a review of international good \npractices and domestic practices in the PRC, an analysis will be conducted on the (i) adequate \nresponsibility alignment between governments and the private sector, (ii) possible options for \npublic and private cooperation, (iii) incentives to attract the private sector, and (iv) possible \nbusiness models providing affordable services for regular pensioners. The analysis will also \nexamine  the  use  of  new  equipment,  information  and  communication  technology,  and  high \ntechnology for the efficient provision of elderly care services; and analyze international good \npractices on developing a management information system for elderly care\u2013health care services. \n \n13.  Output 4: Capacity of central and local governments to develop elderly care policies \nstrengthened.  Output  4  will  provide  opportunities  for  the  central  government  and  local \ngovernments, such as provincial and municipal governments, to strengthen and share their \nknowledge on elderly care systems through trainings, seminars, and workshops. The output will \nalso include field visits to (i) an advanced country to study elderly care system development and \nto learn international good practices, and (ii) PRC provinces to learn from advanced domestic \nexperiences and to enhance understanding of local practices.18 \n \n                                                \n16 Regular pensioners are elderly people who receive pension benefits from old-age pension insurance for enterprise \nworkers. \n17 Outputs 1 and 2 will be strengthened through learning from the relevant regional experiences provided by the \nfollowing TA project: ADB. 2015.
