INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 underscored the need in the current challenging \nglobal economic context for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to complement its investments \nin  cross-border  connectivity  infrastructure  by  supporting  other  drivers of  second-generation \nregional  cooperation  and  integration  (RCI).1 The  strategic  framework  for  the  Central  Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program, 2011\u20132020 (CAREC 2020) states that the \ndevelopment of economic corridors can help diversify the region\u2019s industries. 2 This is expected \nto make the CAREC developing member countries (DMCs) more competitive by strengthening \ntechnology,  logistics,  and  other  business  support  services.  In  line  with  Strategy  2020\u2019s \ndesignation of RCI as one of ADB\u2019s core areas of operations, ADB\u2019s current country partnership \nstrategies  for  these  DMCs  make  support  for  the  CAREC  program  and  regional  economic \ncorridor development a priority.  \n \n2.  The  CAREC  Transport  and  Trade  Facilitation  Strategy  2020  sets  three  operational \npriorities:  developing  multimodal  corridor  networks,  improving  trade  and  border  crossing \nservices, and improving operational and institutional effectiveness. 3 Under the strategy, CAREC \naims to establish and operationalize five regional multimodal logistics centers by 2020. Industrial \npark development will bolster this goal and help develop the CAREC corridors by building \nindustrial demand. \n \n3.  This technical assistance (TA)4 is intended to improve the policy framework for planning, \ndeveloping,  and  upgrading  industrial  parks  in  CAREC  countries  and  thereby  increase  the \nregion\u2019s  industrial  productivity  and  competitiveness.  It  will  focus  on  two  pilot \ncountries\u2500Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  that  best  represent  the  different  levels  of \nprogress among the CAREC DMCs in developing industrial parks. The 13th CAREC Ministerial \nConference held on 5\u20136 November 2014 in the Kyrgyz Republic endorsed a framework for \ncorridor development and the operationalization of this framework through a memorandum of \nunderstanding  on  the  Almaty\u2013Bishkek  Corridor  Initiative,  the  first  of  city  level  regional \ncooperation between Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. 5 Pilot work in these two countries \nwill  provide  useful  lessons  and  experience  for  other  CAREC  countries.6 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES   \n4.  The industrial structures of most countries in Central Asia are less diversified and in \nsome cases dominated by their natural resource sectors. Heavy dependency on the export of \nmineral and energy resources has made these DMCs highly vulnerable to shocks and price \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n2  The CAREC member countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz \nRepublic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. ADB is CAREC Secretariat. The CAREC \nstrategy  provides  a  strategic  direction,  vision,  and  mission  for  2011\u20132020.  It  aims  to  turn  the  landlocked  \nCAREC  nations  into  land-linked  economies  by  expanding  trade  and  improving  competitiveness.  \nADB. 2012.

Many were severely affected by the worldwide economic \ncrisis of 2008. At the same time, traditional extraction and production processes of minerals and \nenergy are unsustainable, causing natural resource depletion and environmental degradation in \nthe  region.  Central  Asian  countries  face  common  development  issues,  such  as  weak \ninfrastructure, high transaction costs, constrained access to finance and low levels of human \ncapital. These challenges hinder deeper economic integration within the region, undermine \nindustrial sector upgrading in terms of productivity and competitiveness, and discourage foreign \ndirect investment.  \n \n5.  The  Midterm  Review  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2020  identified  the  most  critical  drivers  of \nsecond-generation RCI as higher productivity and competitiveness of economies, combined \nwith  efforts  to  mitigate  vulnerabilities  and  reduce  inequalities  (footnote  1).  New  types  of \ninterventions will be needed to achieve results in these areas in Central Asia\u2019s DMCs, as well as \nto meet the other needs inherent in the growth process. Productivity plays a central role, since \nincreasing it is one of the main ways to improve competitiveness. The development of a CAREC \nproduction and supply chain network will lead to greater specialization and productivity in the \nregion. The RCI community of practice in ADB is expanding its examination of the contribution \nRCI  can  make  to  better  productivity,  particularly  through  the  use  of  economic  zones  and \nindustrial parks. \n \n6.   To  stimulate  economic cooperation,  the  CAREC  countries  have  undertaken  various \nsteps toward developing the New Silk Road (NSR). Before political instability and the advent of \nfaster and safer sea transport routes led to its decline and disappearance, the original Silk Road \nwas a series of routes between Asia and Europe along which intercontinental and interregional \ncultural and trade flows had grown for many centuries. In recent decades, the NSR has started \nto emerge due to globalization and regional integration. \n \n7.   The CAREC economic corridor development initiative aligns well with the NSR initiative \nof  the  CAREC  DMCs.  Both  promote  economic  diversification  and  urban  and  industrial \nagglomeration through improved physical connectivity. The six designated CAREC corridors \noverlap geographically with key portions of the NSR. Economic corridor development has been \nidentified as one of the core priorities in the CAREC 2020, and the governments of the CAREC \nDMCs share the understanding that this involves expanding and using physical infrastructure to \ncatalyze and organize economic activities spatially to generate productivity and growth.  \n \n8.  Sound  economic  policy  that  helps  expand  and  improve  transport  and  business \ninfrastructure  can  boost  trade,  promote  economic  diversification  and  competitiveness,  and \npromote productivity. Providing the effective business infrastructure crucial to the development \nof industrial and economic corridors\u2014and through them, better regional integration, economic \ngrowth, and living standards\u2014can require the building of industrial parks, often at transport \nnodes.  Industrial  parks  incubate  new  enterprises,  support  start-ups,  and  encourage \ndevelopment of knowledge-based businesses. They not only serve to  expand exports and \nattract foreign direct investment, but also act as laboratories for economic and industrial policy \nexperiments. \n \n9.  Many of the CAREC countries lack strategic planning in developing industrial parks and \nbusiness incubators for promoting the optimization of industrial structures. Such planning is \nneeded to avoid chaotic competition in industrial development between neighboring countries \nand  to  pursue  industrial  development  that  is  inclusive  and  sustainable.  The  appropriate \nregulatory frameworks that are vital for gaining the confidence of investors are also missing.  \n ", "  3 \n10.   Business infrastructure development is at different stages in the different CAREC DMCs. \nWhile Kazakhstan is relatively advanced in this respect, the Kyrgyz Republic is only beginning \nto plan and develop its industrial parks. Although Kazakhstan has established several industrial \nparks, it is still formulating the legislation it needs to regulate the establishment of these parks \nand  their  activities  strategically.  Its  existing  laws  and  regulations  are  inadequate,  and \nKazakhstan  can  do  better  in  managing  the  creation  and  operations  of  its  industrial  parks \ncohesively at either the national or the local level.7 The Kyrgyz Republic has undertaken some \nstrategic planning in promoting the development of industrial zones, industrial parks, business \nincubators, and business clusters. It currently has four free economic zones but no operating \nindustrial parks.  \n \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be more inclusive and sustainable industrial development in \nthe CAREC region. The outcome will be improved policy for industrial park development in \nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. \n \n12.  The impact and outcome of the TA will be achieved through the delivery of the following \noutputs: \n(i)  Background studies on industrial park development in Kazakhstan and the \nKyrgyz Republic prepared. To get a clearer overview and build on existing \nfindings, background studies will be conducted to identify outstanding issues in \nindustrial park development in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The studies \nmay cover but will not be limited to the following aspects: (i) global trends in and \nthe regional context of industrial park development; (ii) the status quo of the \nexisting and planned industrial parks in the two pilot countries; (iii) the challenges \nand  opportunities  related  to  hard  infrastructure,  the  development  of  related \nservices,  and  institutional  and  legal frameworks;  (iv)  analyses  to  clarify  how \nrelevant  cities  and  industrial  parks  benefit  from  the  industrial  corridor;  (v) \nidentification of adaptable models of industrial park development for these two \ncountries that will lead to their integration into the regional value chain; (vi) the \nmapping  of  participation  in  regional  and  global  value  chains;  and  (vii) \nrecommendations, with the formulation of a list of possible TA and/or project \nproposals in selected industrial parks. \n(ii)  Strategic frameworks for industrial park development in Kazakhstan and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic developed.  Integrating industrial park development into \nthe regional value chain in a coordinated manner with neighboring countries \nrequires strategic planning, scientific site selection, rational functional orientation, \na sustainable development pattern, close interaction between key stakeholders, \na unified layout of industrial parks within each country, and healthy competition \nand  complementarity  with  neighboring  DMCs.  The  development  of  strategic \nframeworks  for  industrial  park  development  in  Kazakhstan  and  the  Kyrgyz \nRepublic  under  the  TA  will  provide  a  decision-making  tool  for  better \ncommunication,  interaction,  and  cooperation  between  different  actors  that \nconcentrates on the best use of resources and structures. These actors include \n                                                \n7  UNIDO. 2014. Conference Report, Second regional conference on a new generation of industrial parks.

The \nstrategic frameworks will identify the main barriers to successful industrial park \ndevelopment in each country and provide guidelines on how to overcome these \nobstacles through strategies, policies, and programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The following activities will be undertaken under the TA: \n(i)  Background studies. The TA will conduct country consultations in Kazakhstan \nand the Kyrgyz Republic to exchange views with relevant stakeholders about the \nobjectives  and  scope  of  activities  and  clarify  necessary  governmental \ninvolvement in TA implementation. The TA will review reports and studies that \nrelate directly or indirectly to industrial park development in the two countries, \nconduct  interviews  with  key  government  officials  and  stakeholders  to  collect \nnecessary information and data, submit and present the draft study reports to the \ntwo governments, and present and disseminate the final background study report \nto key stakeholders in these two countries.  \n(ii)  Strategic  frameworks.  The  TA  will  conduct  a  roundtable  on  the  strategic \nframeworks  for  industrial  park  development  and  identify  potential  areas  of \ntechnical  cooperation  to  be  formulated  and  included  in  future  strategic \nframeworks; design and formulate the strategic frameworks for Kazakhstan and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic; develop a list of TA and/or project proposals in selected \nindustrial  parks;  and  organize  a  dissemination  workshop  on  the  strategic \nframeworks, which will include concrete technical cooperation project concept \nproposals on industrial parks and cities.  \n \n14.   The project assumptions and risks are the following:  \n(i)  Assumptions.  It  has  been  assumed  that  (i)  improved  policies  for  industrial \ndevelopment will be enacted and implemented; (ii) other CAREC countries will \nimprove their respective policy frameworks for industrial park development by \nreplicating or learning from the strategic frameworks the TA will help develop; (iii) \na  sound  investment  environment  for  attracting  capital  flows  for  industrial \ndevelopment;  (iv)  the  governments\u2019  commitments  to  inclusive,  sustainable \nindustrial development will continue; (v) business community representatives will \nparticipate actively in all project consultation meetings; and (vi) the project will \nhave timely access to data and relevant personnel in place in Kazakhstan and \nthe Kyrgyz Republic.  \n(ii)  Risks. Potential obstacles to the TA project\u2019s success include the risks that (i) \nweak institutional capacity resulting in ineffective operationalization of industrial \npolicy frameworks, (ii) insufficient financial and human resources for developing \nand transforming industrial parks, (iii) weak government capacity of engaging key \nstakeholders and obtaining the critical private sector response, (iv) changes in \nstaff within key agencies leading to a loss of support for the TA objectives within \nthese agencies, and (v) political interference delaying submission of the policies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). About 5% of the budget for trainings, workshops, \nseminars, and conferences is allocated for representation costs that are confirmed as direct and \n ", "  5 \nidentifiable costs to the TA and the resource persons engaged in these activities may be ADB \nstaff. The governments of Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic will provide counterpart support \nin the form of hosting meetings and workshops, funding their in-country participation in the \nmeetings, capacity-building activities, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  and West  Asia  Department  will  be  responsible for \nadministering  and  supervising  the  TA.  ADB  will  (i)  create,  consolidate,  and  disseminate \nknowledge and information to support industrial park development in the two pilot countries; (ii) \nhelp concerned national agencies build their institutional capacity to manage industrial park \ndevelopment more effectively; and (iii) act as the facilitator, catalyst, and coordinator of the \ndevelopment of the planned strategic frameworks for industrial park development in the two \nDMCs.  Implementation  will  be  conducted  in  close  consultation  with  the  two  ADB  resident \nmissions and the relevant national authorities in Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic.  \n \n17.  The TA will finance about 41 person-months of consultant services\u201417 person-months \nof international services and 24 person-months of national consultant inputs. One international \nconsultant will be engaged as the leader of the team that will develop the strategic frameworks \nfor industrial park development in the two countries. A second international consultant will be \nengaged to conduct the background studies and help develop the strategic frameworks. Two \ncountry-based national consultants will be hired to assist in the background studies, develop the \nnational strategic frameworks, and organize meetings in the field. Consultants will be hired as \nindividuals to ensure that varied perspectives are available from key experts whose skills, \nqualifications, knowledge, and experience are mutually reinforced and supplemented. Resource \npersons may be engaged to help develop and carry out knowledge-sharing activities. The \nresource  persons  will  work  closely  with  ADB  staff  in  preparing  the  specific  material  and \npresenting it at workshops and other capacity-building events. These resource persons may \nalso be ADB staff. The consultants will be engaged according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  Lump  sum  payments  and  output-based  contracts  will  be \nconsidered for consulting services under the TA. Disbursement under the TA will be done in \naccordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The TA will be implemented over 33 months from January 2015 to September \n2017.  \n \n18.  The United Nations Industrial Development Organization will work closely with ADB to \npromote industrial park development in the CAREC region and provide necessary technical \nsupport to this TA during its implementation.  \n \n \nIV.
