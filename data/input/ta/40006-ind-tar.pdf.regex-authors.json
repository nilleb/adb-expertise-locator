The Government of India (the Government) has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare  a  strategy  for  effective  and  efficient \nGovernment investment in the urban transport sector.1 The ADB Mission, which visited India \nfrom 26 June to 5 July 2006 to prepare the TA, reached an understanding with the Government \non the goal, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference. The TA is \nincluded in the country strategy and program update, 2006\u20132008.2 The project design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Economic activities in the industrial and service sectors primarily take place in urban \nareas. As such, the state of India\u2019s towns and cities is crucial to economy\u2019s future growth. The \nurban sector contributes an estimated 50\u201352% of the country\u2019s net domestic product. More than \n285 million people, or 28% of the population, live in urban areas, according to India\u2019s 2001 \ncensus. Based on the current trends in population growth and migration, the United Nations \nestimates that India\u2019s urban population will reach 575 million by 2030.3 Hence, cities must meet \nthe mobility needs of the current population, as well as provide for the needs of those who will \njoin the urban population in the near future. \n \n3.  The easy and sustainable flow of goods and people in India\u2019s urban areas is facing \nseveral  problems.  The  explosive  growth  in  the  number  of  motor  vehicles,  coupled  with \nlimitations  on  the  amount  of  road  space  available,  has  made  accessing  jobs,  education, \nrecreation, and similar activities increasingly time-consuming, expensive, and dangerous. The \ncost of travel, especially for the poor, has increased considerably as the use of cheaper non-\nmotorized modes that share the same right of way with motorized modes has become extremely \nrisky.  Sprawling  cities  have  increased  travel  distances,  making  non-motorized  modes \nimpossible to use. As a result, access to livelihoods, particularly for the poor, has become far \nmore difficult. Travel in the cities also has become more dangerous, as demonstrated by the \nincrease in accidents from 160,000 in 1981 to more than 390,000 in 2001. The number of \npersons killed in road accidents nearly tripled from 28,400 to more than 80,000 during the same \nperiod. Again, this has tended to impact the poor more severely, as many of those killed or \ninjured are cyclists, pedestrians, or pavement dwellers. Increased use of personal vehicles also \nhas increased air pollution. \n \n4.  The National Urban Transport Policy (NUTP) was established in May 2005 to address \nthese rapidly growing problems, and to offer a clear direction and framework for future actions. \nMajor policy approaches in the NUTP are (i) integration of transport planning with land use; (ii) \nequitable  allocation  of  road  space;  (iii)  greater  use  of  public  transport  and  non-motorized \ntransport; (iv) quality-focused, multimodal public transport systems; (v) effective regulatory and \nenforcement mechanisms for competition among transport operators, and enhanced safety for \nthe users; (vi) enhanced coordination in the planning and management of transport systems; \n(vii) intelligent transport systems for traffic management; (viii) improved road safety; (ix) lower \npollution levels through changes in traveling practices, better enforcement, cleaner technologies, \netc.; (x) capacity building in urban transport planning and management; (xi) innovative financing \nmechanisms; and (xii) private sector participation. \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 July 2006. \n2  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20142008): India. Manila. \n3  United Nations. 2002. World Urbanization Prospects: The 2001 Revision. New York. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  State  governments  are  responsible  for  the  management  of  urban  areas,  and  by \nextension  urban  transport.  The  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  (MOUD)  guides  state \ngovernments on action plans within the NUTP framework. MOUD is also the executing agency \nfor  the  infrastructure  and  governance  component  of  the  National  Urban  Renewal  Mission \n(NURM),  which  seeks,  among  other  things,  comprehensive  improvements  in  urban \ninfrastructure. NURM commits substantial funds for this purpose, and requires a series of \nreforms to make the investments sustainable.4 The urban transport sector is eligible for NURM \nassistance. MOUD also assists state governments by providing grants covering 40% of the cost \nof preparing comprehensive traffic system management plans, feasibility studies, and detailed \nproject reports for urban transportation projects. The NURM has provided significant financial \nsupport from the central Government for investments in urban transport infrastructure, and has \ncoordinated  planning  work  in  urban  transport.  MOUD  promotes  these  specific  initiatives, \nespecially with responsibility for critically evaluating city-specific projects and demands from a \nstrategic perspective under the NUTP. \n \n6.  The investment required to address urban transport problems, such as congestion, air \npollution, accidents, and so on, is massive. State governments have prepared many urban \ntransport project proposals. Policy measures including mass rapid transport system in a city \nneed to take into account the city form, travel demand and so on. To invest a limited budget \neffectively and efficiently, an urban transport strategy is required to achieve the objectives under \nthe NUTP. This strategy will provide consistent and objective criteria for the central Government, \nstate governments, and local authorities to appraise urban transport projects.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The purpose of the TA is to ensure safe, affordable, quick, comfortable, reliable, and \nsustainable access for the growing number of city residents to jobs, education, recreation, and \nother needs within India\u2019s cities in accordance with the NUTP. The urban transport strategy will \nguide  the  central  Government,  state  governments,  and  local  authorities  in  determining \nalternative policy measures to achieve the NUTP objective. It will focus on India\u2019s medium-sized \nmetropolitan areas with populations of 1 million\u20134 million. \n \n8.  The TA will have two components: (i) the integral urban transport strategy component, \nwhich will prepare criteria and guidelines for appraising packages of urban transport measures; \nand (ii) the subsector measures component, which will prepare guidelines and requirements to \nimplement subsector-specific transport measures, including (a) road traffic management, and (b) \nurban rail and bus safety certificate and requirements. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Integral Urban Transport Strategy Component. The component will be prepared in \nthree phases: \n \n \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Support for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission \nProject. Manila. (TA-4775, approved in February). ADB provides this TA to implement the NURM. \n ", "  3\n1.  Phase I: Initial Appraisal Criteria (within 2.5 months) \n \n10.  Through a review of literature and case studies, the TA will identify the physical and non-\nphysical measures of urban transport available to achieve the policy objective. At the same time, \ncritical  factors  that  determine  appropriate  alternative  measures  of  urban  transport  will  be \nidentified, also through literature and case studies. Based on these findings, the relationship \nbetween quantified critical factors and appropriate urban transport measures will be established. \nThis relationship will provide the criteria for appraising what measures are appropriate, given \ncertain trip and city characteristics. Brainstorming among urban transport experts will be used to \ncalibrate the relationship and/or criteria in the context of India\u2019s metropolitan areas. \n \n2.  Phase II: Final Appraisal Criteria With Guidelines and Toolkits (within 4 \nmonths) \n \n11.  The relationship and/or criteria will be verified and calibrated further by applying them to \ndefined  zones  in  selected  metropolitan  areas  where  urban  transport  measures  have  been \nimplemented. Data before and after implementation of the urban transport measures will be \ncollected or estimated for this verification and calibration exercise. Urban transport project \nproposals submitted by states and/or local governments may be used for this assessment, as \nthe proposals include data. The validity of the data will be checked, and/or a supplementary \nsurvey  will  be  conducted.  Limits  to  the  use of  the  relationship  and/or  criteria  also  will  be \nidentified. A guideline and toolkit will be prepared for central Government, state governments, \nand local authorities on how to use the relationship and/or criteria for appraising urban transport \ndevelopment  measures.  The  output  of  the  subsector-specific  measures  component  will  be \nincorporated into this Phase II output. \n \n3.  Phase III: Alternative Packages of Urban Transport Measures for Selected \nMetropolitan Areas (within 6 months) \n \n12.  The TA will prepare alternative packages of urban transport measures for selected \nmetropolitan areas by applying the strategy and criteria developed in Phases I and II. For \nspecific metropolitan areas, the performance indicators will be set to represent policy objectives. \nAlternative policy packages then will be prepared with short-term and long-term projects to \nrealize  the  target  indicators  effectively  and  efficiently.  The  optimal  policy  package  will  be \nidentified from among alternatives based on the overall evaluation. A brief implementation \narrangement will be discussed, taking into account milestones and stakeholders. \n \n13.  Subsector Measures Component. Road traffic management guidelines and manuals \nfor  India\u2019s  metropolitan  areas  will  be  prepared  with  reference  to  guidelines  and  manuals \nadopted in other countries. Training on the use of the proposed guidelines and manuals will be \nprovided to state and local governments, using selected metropolitan areas as case studies. In \naddition, safety requirements of urban rail systems, such as mass rapid transit (MRT) and light \nrail transit (LRT), and rapid bus systems will be prepared with reference to those adopted in \nother countries. A guideline and manual for inspecting urban rail and rapid bus systems, and for \nissuing safety certificates, will be prepared with reference to guidelines and manuals in other \ncountries.  Appropriate  institutions  and  mechanisms  will  be  proposed  for  safety  certificate \nissuance by state governments in the context of India\u2019s government systems. Training on safety \ninspection and  certificate  issuance  will  be  provided  to  state  and  local  governments,  using \nselected urban rail and rapid bus systems. The output will be incorporated into the Phase II \noutput of the integral urban transport component (para. 11). \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  the  equivalent  of  $1.25  million.  ADB  will  provide  \na grant for the equivalent of $1.0 million from its TA funding program. The Government will \nfinance the remaining cost, the equivalent of $250,000, through in-kind contributions of the \nExecuting Agency. The cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOUD will be the Executing Agency of the TA. As such, MOUD will nominate a core \ngroup of counterpart staff, headed by a TA director, to work closely with the consultants on day-\nto-day implementation and reporting of the TA\u2019s progress to ADB. The consultants, who will be \nstationed in the project office of MOUD, will work as a team with the core group of counterpart \nstaff. Workshops will be held to discuss and disseminate the progress and outputs of the TA to \nthe relevant government agencies, such as the Department of Economic Affairs. \n \n16.  The TA will engage three individual consultants and one consultant team. Under the \nintegral urban transport strategy component, the individual consultants will comprise an urban \ntransport planner, an urban transport policy and regulation specialist, and an urban transport \nengineer-cum-traffic  modeler.  The  three  specialists  will  provide  15  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  inputs  during  the  6-month  TA  implementation  period.  Under  the \nsubsector measures component, a consultant team will be engaged to provide about 12 person-\nmonths of international consulting services over 4 months. The experts on the consultant team \nfor this component will include an urban transport engineer as team leader, an urban rail safety \nengineer,  and  a  rapid  bus  safety  engineer,  who  will  be  supported  by  technical  inputs  of \nstructural engineering, signal engineering, and operation engineering, as required. \n \n17.  Individual consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use \nof  Consultants.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  a  team  of  consultants  from  an  international \nconsulting firm using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection procedures, and in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (using the biodata technical proposal procedure). \nEquipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n18.  For the integral urban transport component, the consultants will submit (i) an inception \nreport within 3 weeks of the start of consulting services, (ii) an interim report within 2.5 months, \n(iii) a draft final report within 4 months, and (iv) a final report within 6 months. The inception \nreport  will  include  the  detailed  methodology  and  methods  to  be  used  to  establish  the \nrelationship and/or criteria for appraising urban transport projects. The interim report will include \nthe initial relationship between quantified critical factors and appropriate measures, and hence \nthe criteria for appraising what urban transport measures are appropriate under given conditions. \nThe draft final report will include the final criteria for appraising urban transport projects, in the \nform of a guideline and toolkit, after further verification and application. The final report will \npresent  a  complete  urban  transport  strategy  in  selected  metropolitan  areas,  applying  the \nguideline and toolkit. Four major meetings and/or workshops are envisaged: the first to discuss \nthe inception report, the second to discuss the interim report, the third to consider the draft final \nreport, and the fourth to demonstrate the final outputs. In addition to these major meetings, the \nconsultants will meet with relevant ministries, development partners, and financiers to brief and \nupdate  them  on  the  progress  to  develop  government's  ownership  of  the  strategy.  The \nconsultants will conduct intensive discussions with stakeholders, including relevant ministries, \ndevelopment partners, nongovernment organizations, and private sector entities. \n ", "  5\n \n19.  For the subsector measures component, the consultants will submit (i) an inception \nreport within 3 weeks of the start of the consulting services, (ii) a draft final report within 2.5 \nmonths, and (iii) a final report within 4 months. The inception report will include draft structure of \nguidelines and manuals for each subsector measure. The draft final report will include draft \nguidelines and manuals for each subsector measure, as well as the proposed institution and \nmechanisms for safety certificate issuance by states. The final report will present the guideline \nand manuals, and the institution and mechanisms, to implement these measures, endorsed by \nthe Government. Training will be conducted, as appropriate, to enable government officials to \nuse the guidelines and manuals effectively. The consultants will meet with relevant ministries to \nconfirm the appropriate institution and mechanism for implementing these subsector-specific \nmeasures (e.g., safety certificates). \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, starting in September 2006 and ending in \nMarch 2007. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.

Scope \n1.  The consultants will help the Government of India implement the technical assistance (TA) \nwith two components: (i) the integral urban transport strategy component, which will prepare \ncriteria and guidelines for appraising packages of urban transport measures; and (ii) the subsector \nmeasures component, which will prepare guidelines and requirements to implement subsector-\nspecific transport measures, including (a) road traffic management, and (b) urban rail and bus \nsafety certificate and requirements. It will focus on India\u2019s medium-sized metropolitan areas with \npopulations of 1 million\u20134 million. The integral urban transport strategy and subsector-specific \nmeasures  will  take  into  account  environmental,  social  and  resettlement  aspects  in  preparing \nguidelines. \n \n1.  Integral Urban Transport Strategy (15 person-months international consultants for \n6 months) \n \n2.  The integral urban transport strategy will guide the central Government, state governments, \nand  local  authorities  in  determining  the  most  appropriate  package  of  transport  measures  in \nmetropolitan areas under a multimodal transport framework. The criteria for appraising urban \ntransport measures or projects will be prepared, which will be tantamount to the integral urban \ntransport  strategy.  Proper  considerations  will  be  given  to  traffic  density,  as  well  as  the \ncharacteristics of the trip and metropolitan area. \n \n3.  In a phased manner, the consultant will \n \n  a.  Phase I: Initial Appraisal Criteria \n \n(i)  Identify the physical urban transport measures available to achieve the National \nUrban Transport Policy (NUTP) objective, such as mass rapid transit (MRT); light \nrail transit (LRT); rapid bus; and road traffic management, including pedestrian \npaths; exclusive lanes for two-wheelers, buses, and paratransit and non-motorized \ntransport (NMT); and other means to achieve smooth car movement. These other \nmeans  could  include  appropriate  road  design,  intelligent  transportation  systems \n(ITS),  and  transport-related  facilities,  such  as  terminals  for  trucks  and  buses, \nparking, etc. Actual application of these physical measures in the world will be \npresented. \n \n(ii)  Identify  non-physical  urban  transport  measures  available  to  achieve  the  NUTP \nobjective, such as legal and financial setups (e.g., fare regulation), traffic rules, \nsafety  measures,  level  of  service,  etc.  Actual  application  of  these  non-physical \nmeasures in the world will be presented. \n \n(iii)  Identify critical factors that determine appropriate alternative measures of urban \ntransport. Such quantifiable critical factors might include traffic density, trip length, \ncombination of these, etc. \n \n(iv)  Establish  the  relationship  between  quantified  critical  factors  and  appropriate \nmeasures. For example, the MRT could be appropriate when a trip is long and traffic \ndensity is medium, or when the trip not long but the traffic density is very high. The \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \nrelationship will provide the criteria for appraising what measures are appropriate, \ngiven certain trip and city characteristics. \n \n(v)  Calibrate the relationship and/or criteria in the context of India\u2019s metropolitan areas. \nBrainstorming among urban transport experts might help the initial calibration. \n \nb.  Phase II: Final Appraisal Criteria with Guidelines and Toolkits \n \n(i)  Verify the relationship and/or criteria, calibrate further the relationship and/or criteria \nas required, and identify the limits to the use of the relationship and/or criteria by \napplying the relationship and/or criteria to defined zones in selected metropolitan \nareas  where  urban  transport  measures  have  been  implemented.  Data  will  be \ncollected  before  and  after  implementation  or  estimated  for  this  verification  and \ncalibration exercise. Urban transport project proposals submitted by states and local \ngovernments may be used for this assessment, as the proposals include data. The \nvalidity  of  the  data  will  be  checked,  and/or  a  supplementary  survey  will  be \nconducted. \n \n(ii)  Prepare a guideline and toolkit for the central Government, state governments, and \nlocal  authorities  on  how  to  use  the  relationship  and/or  criteria  for  appraising \nmeasures of urban transport development. This will incorporate the outputs of the \nsubsector measure component. \n \nc.  Phase  III:  Alternative  Packages  of  Urban  Transport  Measures  for \nSelected Metropolitan Areas \n \n(i)  Prepare alternative packages of urban transport measures for selected metropolitan \nareas by applying the strategy and criteria developed in Phases I and II. The focus \nwill be on India\u2019s medium-sized metropolitan areas with populations of 1 million\u20134 \nmillion. This also will demonstrate how the relationship and/or criteria can be applied \nto appraise actual cases and provide alternative measures. \n \n(ii)  Identify metropolitan areas in workshops based on a certain selection criteria, e.g., \nthe reform commitment of the National Urban Renewal Mission (NURM), the high \ncommitment of implementation, etc. \n \n(iii)  Set performance indicators that represent policy objectives. \n \n(iv)  Prepare alternative policy packages with short-term and long-term projects to realize \nthe target indicators effectively and efficiently. \n \n(v)  Identify  the  optimal  policy  package  among  alternatives  based  on  an  overall \nevaluation. \n \n(vi)  Discuss a brief implementation arrangement, taking into account milestones and \nstakeholders. \n \n4.  Individual consultants with expertise in urban transport planning, urban transport policy and \nregulation, and urban transport engineering will be engaged to complete all the tasks. Specific \ntasks of each expert will be as follows:  \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n  i.  Urban Transport Planner (6 person-months) \n \n5.  The specialist will conduct and finalize all the tasks in Phases I, II and III by utilizing inputs \nof the urban transport policy and regulation specialist and the urban transport engineer-cum-traffic \nmodeler as required in specific areas.
