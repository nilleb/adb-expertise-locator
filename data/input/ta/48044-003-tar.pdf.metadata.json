At the request of the Government of Georgia, the technical assistance (TA) was included \nin the country operations business plan,1 2014\u20132016 for Georgia of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to assist in strengthening domestic resource mobilization (DRM) and improving \npublic sector efficiency.2 The TA scope and objectives were discussed during the processing of \nthe proposed programmatic policy-based loan on improving DRM for inclusive growth program.3 \nTwo missions were undertaken to Georgia\u2014a consultation mission (27\u201331 January 2014) and a \nreconnaissance  mission  (17\u201326  March  2014)\u2014to  define  the  TA  scope.  A  TA  fact-finding \nmission, undertaken via videoconference during 16\u201325 June 2014, discussed and agreed on \nthe impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, financing, and terms of reference \nof the proposed TA. Government counterparts consulted included the Ministry of Finance (MOF), \nthe Ministry of Economy and Sustainable Development (MOESD), and the National Bank of \nGeorgia.4 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The double shocks from the August 2008 conflict with the Russian Federation and the \nsubsequent global economic crisis led to a sharp downturn in economic growth in Georgia. \nEconomic recovery took hold in the following years, with real gross domestic product (GDP) \nrebounding to 7.2% in 2011 and 6.2% in 2012. GDP growth slowed to an estimated 3.2% in \n2013\u2013\u2013half  of  its  2012  level.  Weak  investor  confidence  is  contributing  to  the  slowdown, \nreflecting  political  and  policy  uncertainty  and  contraction  in  government  spending.  Total \ninvestments as a share of GDP declined from 29.4% in 2004 to 25.5% in 2013, whereas \ngovernment estimates that the economy needs to invest 30% of GDP every year.5 National \nsavings, one of the lowest in the region, are insufficient to finance necessary investments (16% \nof GDP in 2013) resulting in increasing reliance on foreign inflows. Foreign direct investment as \na share of GDP has declined from 7.3% in 2011 to 5.8% in 2013, and is projected at 5.8% in \n2014. Gross external debt remains high at 62.8% of GDP in 2013. \n \n3.  With the change in government in 2012, public finances have come under pressure as a \nresult of a large increase in social expenditures and limited scope to raise revenues. The current \nfiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP is likely to increase to 3.8% in 2014 because of higher expenditure \ncommitments on universal pension, health, and targeted social programs combined with lower \nrevenues. The International Monetary Fund Article IV Consultation Country Report of 2013 \nnotes the reliance of the national budget on external funding, suggesting that fiscal sustainability \nneeds careful attention.6 To fulfill the increasing demands to finance pensions, infrastructure, \nand other social services commitments, the government needs to become more efficient in \nmanaging public finances by stimulating revenue generation, instituting effective debt and fiscal \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: Georgia, 2014\u20132016. Manila.  \n2  DRM refers to the generation of savings from domestic resources and their allocation to socially productive \ninvestments. Both the public and the private sectors have important roles. The public sector mobilizes domestic \nresources through taxation and public revenue generation for investment in social services and infrastructure. The \nprivate sector mobilizes the savings of households and firms through financial intermediaries, which allocate these \nresources to investment in productive activities. A stable macroeconomic environment is a prerequisite for effective \nDRM. \n3  The TA will contribute to the achievement of policy actions under subprograms 2 and 3 of the Improving Domestic \nResource Mobilization for Inclusive Growth Program, which is being proposed for ADB financing. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2014. \n5  Government of Georgia. 2013. Socio-economic Development Strategy of Georgia, 2020. Tbilisi. \n6  International  Monetary  Fund.  2013.  Georgia:  2013  Article  IV  Consultation.  IMF  Country  Report  13/264. \nWashington, DC. http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2013/cr13264.pdf \n ", "2   \nrisk management practices, and encouraging formal savings. At the same time, a strengthened \ninstitutional and regulatory framework is required to channelize savings and expand private \nsector investment options in secondary debt markets and public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). \n \n4.  Despite  the  characterization  of  Georgia\u2019s  financial  system  as  profitable,  adequately \ncapitalized, and liquid, Georgia\u2019s financial market development indicators are low, with a ranking \nof 93 out of 144 countries.7 Based on the global competitiveness index, Georgia is especially \nuncompetitive in financing through the local equity market (126) and regulation of securities \nexchanges (119), underscoring the limited role of the capital markets in supporting growth in the \nreal economy. The banking sector in Georgia ranks low on ease of access to loans compared \nwith other countries in the region (93 compared with Armenia [69] and Azerbaijan [54]). Georgia \nalso ranked low on availability of financial services (100). \n \n5.  Georgia\u2019s stock market is small and the corporate bond market virtually nonexistent. The \nlegal and regulatory framework to develop capital markets is inadequate. Provisions relating to \nthe protection of minority shareholders, specifying requirements for public offers with clear \ndifferentiation between equity and bond issues, private placement issues, and investor recourse \nin case of dispute, are lacking. These areas, if reformed, will underpin growth of the equity \nmarket and contribute to growth of the corporate debt market. \n \n6.  All Georgian citizens receive pension benefits after the age of 60 for women and 65 for \nmen. Pensions constitute the largest social spending item in the state budget, accounting for \nabout 18% of public expenditure in 2013 and about 4% of GDP. The existing universal pension \nsystem  is  an  important  instrument  of  poverty  reduction  and  old  age  security.  The  current \nstructure of publicly funded pensions imposes a financial burden on the government, raising the \nquestion  of  long-term  fiscal  sustainability.  This  has  prompted  the  government  to  initiate  a \npension reform program that will include a mandatory-funded pension system. A pension reform \nunit has been established and staffed in MOESD to design the new system. The new system \nwill have to address several important reform dimensions\u2013\u2013whether the system will be defined-\nbenefit  or  defined-contribution,  how  mandatory  contributions  will  be  collected,  the  role  of \nvoluntary contributions, whether there be one state fund or several private pension funds to \nchoose from, and how the government will guarantee the security of pension savings. \n \n7.  The existing level and range of pension benefits will have to be assessed to develop a \nreformed system that encourages occupational savings, is more cost-effective, and can provide \ndomestic capital for the development of the economy.8 Growth of pension and other savings will \ncreate an important additional source of investment, and strengthen the country\u2019s social safety \nnet. These long-term funds could be invested\u2014stimulating the development of capital markets, \nespecially interbank money markets and secondary debt markets, which is critical for DRM. \nDeeper capital markets will be necessary to absorb pension contribution inflows and generate \nreasonable returns. In the design of a new system, it is also important to take gender impact into \naccount. Women are, for example, more often less likely to work in formal sectors and generally \nearn lower wages. Women are also more likely to outlive their husbands, who often provide the \nfamily income. The longer life expectancy of women makes survivors\u2019 pensions of significant \nimportance to them. \n \n8.  Lack  of  capital  constrains  infrastructure  development,  which,  coupled  with  a  weak \noperational framework for managing fiscal risks from PPP projects, acts as a barrier in meeting \n                                                \n7  World Economic Forum. 2013. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2012\u20132013. Geneva. \n8  A pension reform unit housed in MOESD has been set up to design a new pension plan. \n ", "  3 \ninfrastructure needs. The government is exploring measures to mobilize additional resources, \nand considering a greater role for PPPs as a way to finance infrastructure services. Private \nsector investment has the potential both to improve funds access to speed up infrastructure \ndevelopment, and to increase the operating efficiency of public services, which will create fiscal \nspace for initiatives in the social sectors. PPPs can also tap into international resources without \nbeing dependent on the availability of public sector finance, which necessitates a robust fiscal \nrisk management framework. \n \n9.  The  government  is  exposed  to  different  types  of  aggregate  fiscal  risks,  including \ncontingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises resulting from the external borrowings of \nthese enterprises. The government\u2019s capacity to carry out debt sustainability analysis is limited. \nA debt strategy has yet to be formulated and the legal framework for debt management needs \nto be updated. Establishing a medium-term debt management strategy to monitor and assess \nfiscal risks  arising  out of  direct  and contingent  liabilities  will  be  a  critical  step.  Contingent \nliabilities are not only important from an institutional angle (to measure exposure, manage risks, \nand do consistent claims analysis), but also are significant for budget transparency and fiscal \ndiscipline. This assumes added significance in the context of developing PPP projects. When \ncreating various special purpose funds, for example, assurances that they will not be used as \nfiscal vehicles need to be integrated in the budget framework as preemptive ex ante provisions, \nin addition to dealing with contingent liabilities after they arise. \n \n10.  Key development issues to be addressed by the TA include enhancing generation of \ndomestic savings, providing investment opportunities by developing money and debt markets, \nand  managing  public  debt  and  fiscal  risks  better.  A  well-functioning  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment in these areas is an essential facilitator in spurring economic growth and creating \nfiscal space. The government is taking steps to ensure that the financial sector is supportive of \ndevelopment in the real sector and is focusing on macroeconomic stability, effective public \nadministration, and private sector competitiveness to boost economic growth and share its \nbenefits. \n  \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be increased availability of domestic resources for effective public and \nprivate investment, as measured by the reduction of fiscal deficit to 1.5% by 2020 from 2.7% in \n2013. The outcome will be a strengthened institutional and regulatory framework for domestic \nresource mobilization, as measured by fiscal risk assessments, amendments to public debt \nlegislation, amendments to the basic law on pensions, and amendments to the law on the \nsecurities market. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have four major outputs: \n \n(i)  Capital  market  master  plan  finalized.  Output  1  will  help  the  government \ndevelop  a  capital  market  master  plan  with  a  time-bound  action  plan on  the \nconcept and direction of capital market reforms including corporate securities, \nsovereign  debt  management,  bond  market  development,  and  money  market \ninstruments. Implementation recommendations will be made through a medium-\nterm action plan (2\u20133 years) and a long-term action plan (3\u20135 years). The TA will \n ", "4   \n(a) assess impediments to capital market development arising from gaps in laws \nand  regulations,  institutional  arrangements,  and  supporting  infrastructure \nincluding  the  accounting  and  auditing  framework  and  technical  capacity; \n(b) prepare  a  diagnostic  report  with  recommendations  and  an  action plan  to \nimprove the legal and regulatory framework, institutional arrangements, market \ninfrastructure,  investment,  governance,  risk  management,  and  fund \nmanagement;  and  (c)  raise  awareness  and  build  consensus  with  relevant \ngovernment ministries, the private sector, investor interest groups, and other \nstakeholders on the benefits of the capital market reform plan including investor \nprotection,  financial  instruments  for  investment,  long-term  savings,  gender \naspects, and close links with pension reforms. \n(ii)  Pension reform strategy developed. Output 2 will develop a pension reform \nstrategy working closely with the government. The TA will (a) develop the present \nand future cost of the existing universal pension system and review the gender \ndifferences in pension eligibility; (b) prepare a diagnostic report on a sustainable \nprivate pension savings system factoring in issues like membership contribution, \ntax considerations, benefits, gender, relationship with universal pension system, \nand legal and regulatory gaps; (c) conduct a survey to gauge public opinion, \ntargeting interest groups such as teachers and business organizations; and (d) \nformulate  a  communications  strategy  for  raising  public  awareness,  including \ngender aspects, and build consensus with all relevant stakeholders. \n(iii)  Legal  and  institutional  framework  for  public\u2013private  partnership \nstrengthened. Output 3 will strengthen the institutional and legal framework for \nPPPs. The TA will (a) review the legal framework governing PPPs in the country \nto identify any gaps to facilitate effective private sector participation in priority \nsectors with a diagnostic and road map of future reforms; (b) set up a risk \nmanagement unit in MOF to identify and assess government investment from the \npoint of view of fiscal risks of direct government support and contingent liabilities; \n(c) develop a risk register with a risk allocation matrix capturing risk categories, \nrisk description with the potential loss if the risk event occurs, risk probability, \npotential  consequence,  allocation  of  risk,  and  mitigation  measures;  and  (d) \nformulate a medium-term capacity building plan to train risk management unit \nstaff. \n(iv)  Public  debt  management  improved.  Output  4  will  strengthen  public  debt \nmanagement and will (a) review the legal framework to identify any gaps related \nto,  for  example,  external  and  domestic  borrowing  and  contingent  liabilities; \n(b) design a medium-term debt management strategy with recommendations and \na  capacity  building  plan  for  debt  monitoring  (including  forecasting  debt \nrepayments and cash management), sensitivity analysis for closer coordination \nwith macroeconomic policies, improving analytical capacity in both external and \ndomestic borrowing, and credit risk assessment for onlending; and (c) make \nrecommendations  to refine  and  improve  the  debt  management financial  and \nanalysis system, structure, its integration with e-treasury and e-budget systems, \nand  provide  hands-on  training  on  debt  management  financial  and  analysis \nsystem operation for government officials. \n \n13.  Key  assumptions for  the TA  include (i)  the government\u2019s continued commitment  to \nreform public sector management, (ii) effective development partner coordination for a joint \nstand on reforms, and (iii) government\u2019s continued high priority to financial sector development \nconsistent  with  TA  recommendations.  Risks  of  the  TA  include  (i)  weak  economic  growth \nimpacting  fiscal  consolidation,  and  (ii)  personnel  changes  leading  to  inability  of  MOF  and \n ", "  5 \nMOESD to coordinate effectively with all agencies involved. The risks will be managed through \ncontinuous dialogue during TA implementation, and effective use of ADB\u2019s Central and West \nAsia Department\u2019s joint venture arrangements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $570,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  administrative \nsupport for meetings, coordination and logistics, translation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented from October 2014 through September 2016. MOF will be \nthe executing agency, and MOESD will be the implementing agency. ADB\u2019s Public Management, \nFinancial Sector, and Trade Division of the Central and West Asia Department will administer \nthe TA. ADB will recruit consulting services, and organize workshops and training programs. \nADB has experience in cooperating with the proposed executing and implementing agencies. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  require  26  person-months  of  consulting  services\u2014five  international \nconsultants for a total of 12 person-months, and three national consultants for 14 person-\nmonths  on  capital  markets,  pension  reforms,  government  debt  management,  and  PPPs. \nConsultants will be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Advance action procedures will be \nused to recruit the TA consultants. Individual recruitment is justified by (i) the small number of \nconsultants  involved,  with  narrowly  focused  expertise;  (ii)  individual  experience  and \nqualifications  in  particular  areas  being  the  main  requirements;  and  (iii)  a  national  project \ncoordinator  will  be  engaged  on  a  part-time  basis  to  oversee  administrative,  training,  and \nlogistics issues as well as to coordinate TA inputs. Resource persons will be used for training, \nworkshops,  seminars,  and  conferences,  notably  on  structural  and  governance  matters  of \npillars II and III pension plans, their regulatory environment, and operational matters such as \ncontribution  and  investment  compliance,  member  communication,  recordkeeping  and \nadministration, fund accounting, benefit payments, and risk management. Training will be held \nin the Academy of the Ministry of Finance. A study tour for two to three MOESD officials will be \narranged to an Asian country that has undergone similar reforms to discuss relevant issues with \npension regulators and fund managers. The terms of reference for consultants are outlined in \nAppendix  3.  Disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Georgia for Strengthening Domestic Resource Mobilization, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nIncreased availability  By 2020, the fiscal deficit  MOF public notification  The government \nof domestic resources  is reduced to 1.5% of  remains committed to \nfor effective public and  gross domestic product  reform public sector \nprivate investment  (2013 baseline: 2.7%)  management \n \nEffective development \npartner coordination \nfor a joint stand on \nreforms \n \nRisk \nWeak economic \ngrowth impacts fiscal \nconsolidation \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrengthened  By August 2016, fiscal risk  Semiannual consultant  Government will \ninstitutional and  assessments conducted  reports  continue to give high \nregulatory framework  for at least two PPP    priority to financial \nfor domestic resource  projects to measure    sector development, \nmobilization  contingent liabilities    consistent with \n    technical assistance \nBy August 2016,  Government decree  recommendations \namendments to key   \nlegislation on public debt,  Risk \npensions, and securities  Personnel changes, \nmarkets submitted to  leading to inability of \nParliament for approval  MOF and MOESD to \ncoordinate effectively \nwith all agencies \ninvolved \nOutputs       \n1.
