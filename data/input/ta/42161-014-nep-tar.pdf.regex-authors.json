INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following the request from the Government of Nepal for capacity development technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  strengthen  the  capacities  of \nmunicipalities, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132012 made a provision for TA for \nStrengthening Municipalities for Urban Service Delivery.1 The country operations business plan, \n2012\u20132014 reconfirmed the processing of this TA. \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission visited Nepal from 24 August to 2 September 2011. This \nreport  is  based  on  the  understandings  reached  with  the  government  during  the  mission \nregarding  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost,  financing \narrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Urban  development  in  Nepal.  In  the  past,  urban  development  often  assumed  a \nsecondary importance to rural development. Consequently, municipalities are characterized by \ninadequate drinking-water supply, sanitation, drainage, solid waste management, and transport \ninfrastructure  and  facilities.  Serious  environmental  issues,  including  an  increased  level  of \nvehicular pollution, haphazard disposal of solid waste and wastewater, and illegal dumping of \nindustrial waste into rivers and streams, are emerging because of uncontrolled and haphazard \nurban development. Insufficient financial resources and qualified human resources, and a low \nlevel of institutional capacity leave urban authorities unable to cope with the growing demand for \nservices by providing commensurate infrastructural facilities. Issues and challenges that the TA \nwill address are detailed in the subsequent paragraphs. \n \n4.  Financial  management  including  revenue  enhancement.  Mobilization  of financial \nresources by municipalities is hampered by the lack of a sound financial management system \nand  innovative  approaches  to  developing  institutional  capacity  to  manage  financial  affairs. \nMunicipalities  are  largely  dependent  on  the  central  government,  whose  grants  and  loans \naccount for a significant portion of their total revenue. There is an urgent need to increase \ninternal revenue by assessing potential sources, such as broadening the tax base, updating \nproperty  tax  valuations,  and  increasing  collection  efficiency.3 Under  the  previous  capacity \ndevelopment TA, a review of the current financial management system was carried out for \nDharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar, the four municipalities participating in the \ncurrent TA.4 That review covered revenue administration management, types of taxes and non-\ntaxes, the status of application of the integrated property tax, the collection level and efficiency \nof taxes and non-taxes over the years, assessment methods of tax valuation, staff capacity, and \nthe potential for revenue enhancement. The review also covered the current accounting and \naudit systems, practices, and recording status, including the level of computerization of the \naccounting  system,  a  plan  to  reduce  backlogs  in  financial  data  entry,  adoption  of  annual \nfinancial statements, and internal and external audits of annual financial statements. Based on \nthe review, a comprehensive financial management improvement plan (CFMIP) was prepared \nfor each participating municipality. The plan, which covers 5 years, needs to be implemented. \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 November 2011. \n3  Internal revenue includes integrated property tax (or house and land tax), business and professional tax, vehicle \ntax, building permit fee, recommendation fee, rent, and fines. \n4  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Institutional Strengthening of Municipalities. Manila. \n ", "2   \n5.  Most internal audit units are not in place, and internal audits are essentially irregular in \nfrequency  and  not  effective.  Backlog  of  internal  audits  is  quite  common  in  municipalities. \nAccumulated advances are high and generally not settled in time. The practice of periodic \nreconciliations  varies  from  municipality  to  municipality  with  reconciliations  done  monthly, \nquarterly, semiannually or annually when they should be carried out monthly. Efforts need to be \nmade  to  improve  the  accounting  system,  quality  of  audit  reports,  when  such  reports  are \nproduced, as well as the time taken for reconciliations. \n \n6.  Urban planning. Municipalities and emerging towns have developed haphazardly in the \nabsence of stringent policy regulating and managing growth. Unplanned growth has created a \nnumber of problems: deficiencies in basic urban services, lack of sanitation and solid waste \nmanagement systems, environmental degradation, and encroachment of settlements on public \nlands,  forests,  and  rivers.  Legislative  support,  institutional  strengthening,  and  community \nempowerment are needed to enable municipalities to implement municipal building bylaws and \nnational building codes. \n \n7.  Geographic information system\u2013based urban mapping. Many municipalities still lack \nproper base maps. Although the participating municipalities have or are developing basic digital \nbase maps, they have no software to run the geographic information system (GIS), and only \nvery limited information and data are available in the GIS. The existing maps do not support the \nfunctions that municipalities need to perform. With rapid urbanization, there is a strong need to \ndevelop and update large-scale, GIS-based urban maps using an adequate socioeconomic \ndatabase.  Updated maps  will  bring multiple  benefits  because  they  can  be  used for many \npurposes:  better  urban  and  project  planning,  a  better  tax  information  base,  and  better \nengineering of public works. \n \n8.  Participating  municipalities.  The  TA  will  primarily  target  four  municipalities  where \ninvestment projects are planned with ADB funding under the Integrated Urban Development \nProject: Dharan, Janakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar.5 These municipalities, which are \nimportant urban centers in their regions, have high economic growth potential but suffer from \nserious deficits of urban infrastructure. The TA complements the urban development project by \ndeveloping institutional capacity to ensure effective, efficient implementation as well as financial \nand technical sustainability of the improvements in service delivery. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  expected  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  stronger  institutional  capacity  in  Dharan, \nJanakpur, Nepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar for urban service delivery. Stronger capacity will be \nmeasured by improvements in service levels of urban infrastructure and in services provided. \nThe  outcomes  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  financial  management  and  strengthened  urban \n                                                \n5  The project is in the 2012 investment pipeline. ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Nepal, 2012\u20132014. \nManila. Although the focus of support will be on the four municipalities, follow-up support will also be provided to \nBiratnagar,  Birgunj,  and  Butwal  municipalities,  where  a  CFMIP  was  prepared  and  GIS-based  urban  maps \ndeveloped under the previous TA. The previous TA activities were completed in October 2011, but additional \nsupport is required to implement the CFMIP and make the GIS fully functional. Being the implementing agencies of \nthe ongoing Secondary Towns Integrated Urban Environmental Improvement Project, the follow-up support is \ncritical for the successful implementation of the project approved by ADB in 2010.

These two outcomes will be \nmeasured by (i) an increase in the internal revenue of municipalities, (ii) public disclosure of \namended  building  bylaws,  and  (iii)  new  buildings  constructed  in  compliance  with  building \npermits issued by participating municipalities under the amended building bylaws and national \nbuilding codes. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have six outputs. The major activities of each output are as follows:  \n \n11.  Output 1: Tax net extended for property tax. To improve the internal revenues of the \nmunicipalities, the cadastre for properties owned by individuals and businesses needs to be \nexpanded. The current tax net coverage is estimated at about 60%, with only partial registration \nof identified taxpayers in the database. This output is intended to provide support to register all \nproperties  and  owners  (i.e.,  taxpayers)  in  the  cadastral  database.  The  scope  of  services \nconsists of assisting the municipalities in (i) preparing awareness campaigns to present the \nservices provided by the municipalities and motivate taxpayers to register, and (ii) entering data \nin the database during the campaigns. \n \n12.  Output 2: Internal audit carried out regularly and as per standard. The scope of \nservices consists of assisting the municipalities in implementing the CFMIP by audit unit and \nsupporting the preparation of internal audit reports. Issues addressed under this output will \ninclude (i) insufficient accounting and auditing systems, and (ii) irregularities reported in the \naudit report. \n \n13.  Output 3: Staff skills enhanced in accounting, budgeting, and internal auditing. \nThe  scope  of  services  consists  of  assisting  the  municipalities  in  implementing  the  CFMIP \nthrough disseminating the plan and consulting stakeholders, preparing internal guidelines and \nmanuals, conducting training programs, and monitoring action plans so that the municipalities \ncan sustain implementation after the consultancy services are completed. \n \n14.  Output 4: Amended building bylaws approved. This output is intended to strengthen \nurban planning by assisting the municipalities in (i) reviewing and revising building bylaws \ndelineating urban functions in municipalities, and (ii) implementing building bylaws and national \nbuilding codes. The amended building bylaws will be approved by the municipal councils. \n \n15.  Output 5: GIS-based urban maps used for taxation and urban service delivery. \nThis  output  is  intended  to  strengthen  urban  planning  by  assisting  the  municipalities  in \ndeveloping a complete and effective GIS-based municipal information system. Information in the \nmaps will include administrative boundaries, topographic features such as contour lines and \nland  use,  transportation  infrastructure,  utilities  infrastructure,  buildings,  cadastral  data,  and \nsocioeconomic  data.  The  maps  will  be  used  to  establish  an  effective  house  and  street \naddressing system. The system will also link the GIS with the property and business taxation \nsystem of the municipality and be the basis for updating the municipalities\u2019 cadastres. \n \n16.  Output  6:  Staff  skills  enhanced  for  GIS-based  urban  mapping.  Capacity \ndevelopment programs will be undertaken for municipal staff to institutionalize the use of the \nGIS-based  municipal  information  system  and  optimize  it  for  municipal  decision  making, \nincluding tax mapping, infrastructure planning, and public works engineering. \n \n ", "4   \n17.  Risks.  The  municipalities  have  lacked  elected  mayors  and  municipal  council \nrepresentatives  since  2002.  Considering  the  current  political  conditions,  this  situation  may \ncontinue. It causes a lack of accountability and leadership in improving the performance of \nmunicipal functions. Furthermore, executive officers acting as mayors of municipalities, deputed \nfrom the Ministry of Local Development (MLD), are often transferred within a short time, which \nimpedes the continued strong commitment of municipality leaders. This risk will be minimized \nthrough close consultations with political parties at the municipal level. The TA\u2019s links with the \nforthcoming  investment  project  will  help  create  strong  municipal  and  public  support  for \nimproving the capacity and performance of municipalities. The selection criteria and process for \nidentifying municipalities with relatively higher capacities both help improve the chances of \nsuccess of the TA and mitigate risks. One risk is that the new constitution that the government is \nformulating could affect the local governance system. However, the TA is in line with the general \ndirection of the government toward strengthening devolution, and the functions of municipalities \nare largely expected to remain as they are. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The government has asked ADB to finance the equivalent of $1 million. The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others). The \ngovernment  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  space,  remuneration  for \ncounterpart  staff  (including  their  field  per  diem  and  transportation),  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  MLD  and  the  Ministry  of  Physical  Planning  and  Works  (MPPW),  through  the \nDepartment of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC), will be the executing \nagency. The MLD will assign the chief of the municipal planning section (undersecretary) as a \nTA coordinator to coordinate and supervise the work for outputs 1\u20133, while the DUDBC will \nassign the chief of the urban development division (deputy director general) as a TA coordinator \nfor outputs 4\u20136. The two TA coordinators will collaborate closely and be jointly responsible for \nsupervising the TA. At the central level, a steering committee will be established to monitor TA \nimplementation. The steering committee, which will be co-chaired by the secretaries of the \nMPPW and the  MLD,  will  consist  of  high-level  representatives from  the  National  Planning \nCommission, the Ministry of Finance, the MLD, the MPPW, the Secretariat of the Local Body \nFiscal Commission, the Municipal Association of Nepal, participating municipalities, the Town \nDevelopment Fund, and the DUDBC. The TA coordinators will work as members and conveners \nof the steering committee. Technical departments and institutions (such as the Department of \nWater Supply and Sewerage, the Department of Roads, and the Solid Waste Management \nTechnical Support Center) will be invited whenever relevant issues are on the agenda. The \nsteering committee will meet at least quarterly to discuss overall progress and provide policy \nguidance  to  the  TA.  At  each  participating  municipality,  a  focal  person  for  the  TA  will  be \nappointed and a working committee established to work closely with the TA consultants. The \nworking committee will comprise representatives from town development committees, as well as \nsections  or  subsections  on  revenue,  accounting,  audit,  urban  planning,  GIS,  water  and \nsanitation, transport, solid waste management, and any other relevant fields. Local offices of \ntechnical departments and institutions will be closely involved with outputs 4\u20136. \n \n20.  The government will provide (i) all relevant documents, data, statistics, information, and \nmaps that are at its disposal; (ii) appropriate and qualified counterpart staff, including their field \nper diem and field transportation; (iii) TA coordinators from the MLD and the DUDBC, to be \n ", "  5 \nassigned before the consultants\u2019 mobilization; (iv) TA focal persons and counterpart staff from \neach participating municipality, to be assigned before the consultants\u2019 mobilization; (v) office \naccommodation and office equipment, including desks and chairs, and local communication for \noutputs 1\u20133 in the MLD and outputs 4\u20136 in DUDBC; (vi) logistical assistance for the workshops \nand seminars, including providing the venue, and identifying and inviting the participants; and \n(vii) utility costs, covering electricity and water. \n \n21.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from July 2012 to June 2014. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. International expertise (9 person-months) \nwill be obtained in urban planning and management information systems. National consultants \n(80 person-months) will have expertise in urban planning, financial management, information \nsystems, and GIS. In addition, individual consultants may be engaged to address specific needs \nof the participating municipalities. \n \n22.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). A team of consultants will be recruited under \none package using the quality- and cost-based method of selection, with a standard quality\u2013cost \nratio of 80:20. A simplified technical proposal will be used for the selection of the consultant firm. \nThe consultants will assist the government in organizing the workshops at the beginning of the \nTA and toward its completion. The overall framework and approach, objectives, and targets of \nthe TA will be shared at the first workshop with relevant government agencies and municipalities. \nThe final workshop will be held to disseminate good practices and lessons from the TA for \nreplication and scaling up. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n23.  Some equipment (such as computers, printers, and GIS software) will be procured under \nthe TA using the shopping method, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas amended from time to time). The government will ensure proper storage and appropriate use \nof the equipment and software placed in participating municipalities during TA implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of TA not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to the Government \nof Nepal for Strengthening Municipalities for Urban Service Delivery, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nStronger institutional  Flooding duration in heavy  Project progress and  Policy on \ncapacity of Dharan,  rains decreased in 95% of  completion reports  decentralization and \nJanakpur, Nepalgunj,  the town from (i) 5 hours to  prepared by the  devolution remains in \nand Siddharthanagar  less than an hour in  executing agency of the  place \nmunicipalities for  Janakpur, (ii) 8 days to 3  proposed Integrated \nurban service delivery  hours in Nepalgunj, and  Urban Development \n(iii) 5 hours to less than an  Project \nhour in Siddharthanagar \nWater supply service \ncoverage increased from \n83% to 95% in Dharan \n(target in 2017 and \nbaseline in 2011) \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved financial  Internal revenue of  Annual report of  Staff trained remain in \nmanagement and  municipalities increased by  municipalities  respective posts \nurban planning for  40% by 2014 compared to   \nDharan, Janakpur,  2011  Risk \nNepalgunj, and  Amended building bylaws  Annual report of  Absence of elected \nSiddharthanagar  disclosed to public by  municipalities  mayor and \nmunicipalities  December 2013  representatives \nNew buildings constructed  Annual report of  resulting in lack of top-\nin compliance with building  municipalities  level commitment in \npermits issued by  improvement \nparticipating municipalities \nunder the amended \nbuilding bylaws and \nnational building codes by \n2014 \nOutputs       \n1.

Objective \n1.  The  objective  of  the  assignment  is  to  strengthen  capacity  of  Dharan,  Janakpur, \nNepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar municipalities for improved urban service delivery. \n \n2.  The  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  be  closely  linked  to  the \nproposed Integrated Urban Development Project. One of the outputs of the Integrated Urban \nDevelopment Project is to develop municipal infrastructure. The purpose of the TA is to support \nthe sustainability of the infrastructure through stronger institutional capacity in Dharan, Janakpur, \nNepalgunj, and Siddharthanagar municipalities. The TA will have six outputs grouped under two \ncomponents: (i) improving the financial management system, including revenue enhancement; \nand (ii) strengthening urban planning by developing and implementing building bylaws and \nbuilding codes supported by geographic information system (GIS)\u2013based municipal information \nsystem. \n \nB.
