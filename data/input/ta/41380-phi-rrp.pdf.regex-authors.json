Subprogram  1  is  proposed  to  be \nsupported by a loan of $300 million to be released in two tranches.  \n     \n \nClassification    Target Classification: General intervention \nSector Classification: Law, economic management, and public \npolicy \nSubsectors: National government administration, law and judiciary, \npublic finance and expenditure management \n    Themes: Governance, capacity development \n    Subtheme: Public governance, anticorruption, institutional   \n    development  \n \nEnvironmental    Category C \nAssessment \n \nSocial Sector    Involuntary resettlement \u2013 Category C \nAssessment    Impact on indigenous people \u2013 Category C \n \nProgram Rationale.  The  Philippines  suffers  from  poor \nperceptions of governance as captured in social weather surveys, \ninvestment climate surveys, and international comparisons. While \nprogress is being made in macroeconomic management and fiscal \nstability, other performance indicators have deteriorated, including \nthose of corruption. Recognizing these challenges, the Medium-\nTerm Philippine Development Plan 2004\u20132010 (MTPDP) lays out \nthe  agenda  to  improve  institutions  and  governance  outcomes \nthrough actions that will enhance both the supply and demand for \ngood governance. MTPDP includes an extensive discussion on the \nrule  of  law  and  needed  governance  reforms  in  justice  sector \ninstitutions.  On  the  supply  side  of  the  reform  dynamics,  the \nGovernment, as the provider of public goods and service delivery, \nis undertaking a multi-year reform program to strengthen the state\u2019s \nadministrative  capability\u2014skills,  incentives  and  salaries,  human \nresources, and financial management systems\u2014to deliver public \ngoods and services at both the national and local government level. \nThe  Government  recognizes  that  supply-side  factors  are \nnecessary, but not sufficient to improve public services and reduce \ncorruption. Demand-led \u201cvoice\u201d and empowerment elements are \nalso needed to strengthen accountability arrangements. A vibrant \ncivil society, coupled with measures in support of transparency and \naccountability,  provides  an  incentive  to  change  behavior  and \nimprove the public service performance of government institutions. \n ", "  ii\nCivil society and nongovernmental organization stakeholders play \nan important role in sustaining policy dialogue on justice sector \nreforms.  These  groups  hold  strong  interests  that  protect  the \nreforms  from  state  capture,  and  their  advocacy  during  policy \ndialogue makes the justice sector and government actions more \nresponsive to the needs of its users. \n \nThe MTPDP envisions a judiciary that is independent, effective, \nand efficient, resulting from a holistic and integrated reform effort in \nthe  justice  system.  In  addition,  it  recognizes  the  important  link \nbetween  the  rule  of  law  and  institutional  reforms  in  the  justice \nsector,  and  a  strategy  to  fight  poverty  and  promote  inclusive \ngrowth.   \n  \nThe justice sector is an interlocking set of agencies that includes \nthe judiciary, which is an independent branch of government, and \nagencies  from  the  executive  branch,  including  the  institutions \nresponsible for prosecutions, enforcement, corrections, penology, \nand public legal assistance. Improving the public service delivery of \njustice sector agencies requires a number of interlinked reforms, \nincluding  strengthened  incentives  to  deliver  public  services, \nenhanced  expenditure  and  budget  management  capabilities, \naccountability for the use of resources, more efficient delivery of \njustice,  greater  citizen  voice  and  participation,  and  increased \naccess to justice.    \n \nA key factor in the weakness of justice sector institutions has been \npoor  incentives  and  a  lack  of  financial  resources  that  have \nconstrained expenditures and capacities, and ultimately resulted in \npoor public service delivery. The impact of budgetary constraints \nhas  led  justice  sector  agencies  to  prioritize  recurrent  expenses \n(primarily personnel). Budgetary compression has also resulted in \nlow  salaries  that  when  coupled  with  antiquated  equipment  and \ninfrastructure create vacancies in staff positions and disincentives \nfor efficient performance. Resource constraints also make justice \nsector agencies\u2014particularly the judiciary, prosecution service, and \nlaw  enforcement\u2014susceptible  to  external  influence,  which \nundermines the independence of courts and the integrity of other \njustice  sector  agencies.  Justice  sector  fiscal  management \ncapabilities,  particularly  in  budget  planning  that  can  play  an \nimportant  role  in  strengthening  fiscal  autonomy  in  spite  of \ngovernment budget constraints, is currently weak. This prevents \njustice sector agencies from defending their budget requests and \nobtaining the resources that they need. The absence of resources \nin justice sector agencies to exercise stronger oversight functions \nconcerning  their  field  offices  and  the  dearth  of  transparent \nprocedures and accountability mechanisms with respect to the use \nof public funds contribute to the perception that the agencies are \nsusceptible to corruption.  \n \n ", "iii   \nADB\u2019s focus on governance, macroeconomic management, public \nexpenditure management, and anticorruption in the Philippines is \nanchored in ADB\u2019s Development Policy Support Program for the \nPhilippines, which complements and reinforces ADB\u2019s sector loan \nprograms  and  projects  that  are  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s \nstrategies.  The  Development  Policy  Support  Program  sets  out \nbroad  policy  outcomes  for  improving  public  expenditure \nmanagement, but leaves the rollout to sector programs such as the \nLocal Government Finance and Budget Reform Program and the \nproposed Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program (GJSRP). \nThe proposed GJSRP will support increased budget resources to \nthe justice sector and improved expenditure management through \nthe rollout of the medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF), the \noperational performance indicators framework (OPIF), and internal \ncontrols  for  better  justice  service  delivery,  all  of  which  are  key \noutcomes and outputs of the Government\u2019s national priorities that \nare incorporated in the Development Policy Support Program.   \n \nADB has provided longstanding support to the Philippine judiciary \nand recently expanded the scope of such support to other justice \nsector  agencies  in  recognition  that  the  impact  of  governance \nreforms in the judiciary would be undermined without reforms in \nother justice sector agencies. The Philippine country strategy and \nprogram identifies governance and support for judicial reforms as \nkey  pillars  of  ADB\u2019s  development  assistance.  The  proposed \nGJSRP  reflects  the  Government\u2019s  priority  of  promoting  good \ngovernance  in  the  justice  sector  and  builds  upon  related  ADB \nsupport to this sector.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The proposed GJSRP will support the Government in its efforts to \nenhance the rule of law in the Philippines. GJSRP implementation \nwill result in improved governance and efficiency of justice sector \nagencies while expanding access to justice by (i) strengthening \njudicial  fiscal  autonomy  and  justice  sector  accountability,  and \nimproving public access to the resources of justice sector agencies; \n(ii)  enhancing  the  integrity  of  justice  sector  personnel;  (iii) \nsupporting  the  governance  and  efficiency  of  justice  sector \nagencies;  (iv)  expanding  access  to  justice  by  the  poor  and \nvulnerable groups, with specific focus on addressing gender-based \ndiscriminatory practices and gender gaps; and (v) expanding the \ndelivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution. GJSRP is \nexpected  to  result  in  a  more  efficient  processing  of  cases  and \nenhanced and prompt access to court decisions. With improved \naccess by the poor and vulnerable groups to the justice system, the \nProgram also expects to see a decline in the time that legal aid \nclients spend in pretrial detention. There will also be increased use \nof alternative dispute resolutions, such as arbitration and court-\nannexed mediation, more certainty in the court decisions, and an \nincreased recognition of international arbitration awards, which has \nbeen a difficult issue for foreign investors.  \n \n ", "  iv\n \nFinancing Plan  A  proposed  loan  of  $300  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources will be provided under the London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility for subprogram 1. The loan will have \na 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate \nto be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \n \nProgram Period  The  program  cluster  period  is  from  January  2006  until  August \n2010, with a loan of $300 million to be disbursed in two tranches \nunder subprogram 1, when the Government has met the conditions \nfor release of the first and second tranche. Subprogram 2 will be \nsubmitted for Board consideration approximately 30 months after \nthe  effectiveness  of  subprogram  1  (i.e.,  by  2011),  subject  to \nadequate progress of reforms and the Government\u2019s readiness to \ncontinue with its reform agenda. \n \nCounterpart Funds  Counterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the subprogram \n1  loan  will  be  used  for  budget  support  in  meeting  government \nexpenditures  for  social  and  infrastructure  programs,  and  the \nassociated fiscal costs of the governance in justice sector reforms.  \n \nExecuting Agencies  Two  executing  agencies  are  proposed  for  the  GJSRP:  the \nSupreme  Court  and  the  Department  of  Finance  (DOF).  The \nSupreme Court will be the executing agency for program activities \nfocused  on  reforms  in  the  judiciary,  while  the  DOF  will  be  the \nexecuting  agency  for  all  other  program  activities  within  the \nexecutive branch of government. Given the independence of the \njudiciary  from  the  executive  branch  of  government  under  the \nPhilippine Constitution, it is deemed necessary to establish two \nexecutive agencies to account for the differing responsibilities of \nattaining outcomes in both branches of government.  \n \nImplementation  Implementing  agencies  will  include  the  Department  of  Justice \nArrangements  (DOJ),  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government \n(DILG), the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) and \nthe Office of Solicitor General (OSG). The Supreme Court and \nDOF  will  jointly  set  up  a  program  coordination  committee \ncomprising representatives from each of the executing agencies, \nand  DOJ,  DILG,  DBM,  and  OSG.  The  program  coordination \ncommittee will be responsible for implementation of the reform \nprogram and will monitor progress and support the implementation \nof the cluster and provide guidance to the implementing agencies. \n \nProcurement and                 The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and \nprocured in ADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and \nimports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The \nGovernment will certify its compliance with this formula with each \nwithdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under \n ", "v   \nexisting procedures will be required. ADB reserves the right to audit \nthe  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. The loan proceeds will be disbursed to \nthe  Borrower  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nSimplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n \nProgram Benefits                 The program\u2019s principal benefits are improved incentives increased \nand Beneficiaries  increased resources, and greater accountability leading to a higher \nquality of public services in the justice sector. Primary beneficiaries \nwill be justice sector agencies and staff, who will benefit from a \nbetter-resourced justice sector. While most benefits are expected \nto  emerge  over  the  long  term,  in  the  short  to  medium  term, \ncompetitive salaries and higher budgets are expected to reduce \nvacancies among judges and prosecutors, improve information and \ncase  management  systems,  and  provide  the  basis  for  a \nprogressive  reduction  in  delays  in  the  justice  system. \nConsequently, the Program will also benefit users of the justice \nsystem,  who  will  enjoy  more  efficient  and  effective  delivery  of \njustice.  Faster  court  decisions,  and  wider  dissemination  of \ninformation about justice sector functions and services will improve \nthe  public\u2019s  understanding  and  confidence  in  the  formal  court \nsystem, mediation, arbitration, and informal mechanisms of dispute \nsettlement. The Program also has a special focus on the poor and \ndisadvantaged  groups, and  a  commitment  to  promote  capacity-\nbuilding initiatives aimed at addressing gender-based violence. \n \nRisks, Assumptions  While some of the risks of the GJSRP are political and outside of \nand Mitigation Measures   the scope of the Program to directly mitigate, the Program and \nadvisory TA will contribute toward mitigating other risks through \ngreater  transparency  and  accountability  mechanisms,  by \nstrengthening the capacity of justice sector agency officials and \nstaff, and enabling active monitoring by civil society groups. The \npotential risks and mitigation measures  include:   \n  (i)      The Philippine economy in 2008 has been affected by three \nadverse developments in the external environment: (a) the \nknock-on  effects  from  the  financial  crisis  in  the  United \nStates, (b) United States and global economic slowdown, \nand (c) commodity and fuel price increases. In recognition \nof  the  impact  of  these  exogenous  shocks  to  the  fiscal \nposition, the Government has adjusted its fiscal balance \ntarget from 2008 to 2010. The easing of the fiscal target will \nprovide more headroom for expenditures, including needed \nincreases  in  budgetary  resources  for  justice  sector \nagencies. The Government has remained steadfast in its \ndevelopment program\u2014increased infrastructure spending, \nsupport for critical sectors (e.g., mining, business process \noutsourcing,  and  tourism,  among  others)\u2014in  support  of \neconomic  growth,  while  sustaining  revenue  mobilization \nefforts. Nevertheless, it is expected that there will be a net \neconomic  slowdown  that  will  adversely  affect  the \n ", "  vi\nGovernment\u2019s ability to increase fiscal resources allocated \nto the justice sector. \n  (ii)  While  the  Constitution  protects  the  fiscal  autonomy  and \nindependence of the judiciary, budgetary constraints and \nweaknesses  in  administration  hamper  the  judiciary\u2019s \nexercise of fiscal autonomy and independence in practice. \nRectifying  this  requires  continued  commitment  to  good \ngovernance  from  the  judiciary  and  other  branches  of \ngovernment,  including  LGUs.  It  will  also  depend  on  the \nspeed and commitment of the judiciary and its personnel to \nestablish effective administrative and financial mechanisms \nthat  are  transparent,  participatory,  and  provide  a  strong \nsense  of  accountability  for  the  use  of  public  resources. \nUnder the attached TA, ADB will continue to support the \njudiciary in its fiscal and administrative reforms, including \nsupport for change management to help mitigate this risk. \n  (iii)  Weak absorptive capacity of the justice sector agencies due \nto inadequate resources (financial and human) will continue \nto  undermine  the  impact  of  reforms.  However,  close \nperformance monitoring and targeted technical assistance \nto the implementing agencies will help reduce the adverse \neffects  of  implementation  delays  due  to  capacity \nconstraints.  \n  (iv)   The slow pace of civil service reform limits the ability of \njustice  sector  agencies  to  rationalize  their  staff  and \ntransform those savings into more attractive remuneration \nfor  recruiting  and  retaining  qualified  personnel,  and \nundermines  ongoing  initiatives  to  improve  capacity.  To \naddress this risk in the judiciary, the TA includes support for \nthe  judiciary  to  prepare  a  staff  rationalization  plan  for \nsubmission to DBM and the Civil Service Commission.  \n  (v)  There is a risk that current reforms may be reversed by \nfuture governments. This risk may be mitigated by ongoing \npolicy  dialogue  with  the  Government  as  well  as  other \nstakeholders including the judiciary, legislative branch, civil \nsociety, business associations, academia, and development \npartners. The Program targets reforms that are in the public \ninterest  so  that  the  reversal  of  reforms  by  future \ngovernments  may  be  less  likely.  Support  under  the \naccompanying TA for the establishment of a Justice Sector \nCoordination Council (JSCC) will facilitate policy dialogue \nand help build greater public awareness and a stronger \nconstituency for the ongoing reform agenda. \n \nTechnical Assistance  The Government has requested ADB to provide an advisory TA \ngrant  to  assist  justice  sector  agencies  in  preparing  and \nimplementing  the  governance  and  policy  reforms  under \nsubprogram 2.  \n \nThe total amount of the TA is $2.2 million, of which $1.5 million will \nbe sourced from the ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund and \n ", "vii   \n$500,000  will  be  provided  from  the  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund on a grant basis and administered by ADB. The \nGovernment  will  provide  the  remaining  $200,000  equivalent \nthrough in-kind contributions.  \n \nThe executing agencies will be the Supreme Court and DOF, and \nimplementing agencies will include DOJ, DBM, and DILG. The TA \nwill support the judiciary, and justice sector and oversight agencies \nto  implement  and  monitor  key  governance  reforms,  including \nreforms  relating  to  financial  management,  development  of  a \nmedium-term expenditure program for the justice sector, change \nmanagement and advocacy, strengthening programs for access to \njustice by the poor and vulnerable groups, and enabling greater \nand more effective use of alternative dispute resolution. To pursue \nthe objective of gender and development in the justice sector, a \ngrant-financed  component  under  the  TA  is  proposed.  This \ncomponent  will  be  implemented  by  a  national  organization \n(nongovernmental  organization  or  academic  institution)  in \nconsultation with the Committee on Gender Responsiveness in the \nJudiciary  and  will  provide  support  to  the  Supreme  Court, \nCommittee  on  Gender  and  Development  of  the  DOJ,  and  the \nHuman Rights Office of the Philippine National Police.  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL  \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendations on (i) a proposed \nprogram cluster for the Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program (GJSRP), and (ii) a \nproposed loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram1 of the GJSRP. The report also \ndescribes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Supporting Governance in Justice Sector \nReform in the Philippines, and if the Board approves the program cluster and loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA and administration of a \ngrant to be provided from the Gender and Development Cooperation Fund.1 The program \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n         \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT  \n \nA.  Review of the Economy and Investment \n2.  The Philippines Recorded Robust Economic Performance in 2007 (Table 1). Real \ngross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.2% in 2007, the highest growth rate in three decades. \nThe economic expansion has been notable in recent years, with the last recorded contraction \noccurring  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis  in  1998.  The  expansion  reflects  improving \nmacroeconomic  fundamentals;  economic  management  associated  with  low  inflation;  and  a \ncredible independent central bank that has been increasingly supported by fiscal consolidation, \ndeclining public debt, and 4 consecutive years of a current account surplus based on record \nhigh remittances from Filipinos working abroad.  \n \nTable 1: Aggregate Economic Performance \n \nIndicator  2006  2007 \nGross national product, growth rate (%)  6.1  8.0 \nGross domestic product (GDP), growth rate (%)  5.4  7.2 \nInvestment/nominal GDP (%)  14.5  15.3 \nInflation rate (%)  6.3  2.8 \n91-day T-bill rate (%)  5.4  3.4 \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (1.1)  (0.2) \nExports of goods, growth rate (%)  14.9  6.1 \nImports of goods, growth rate (%)  9.2  6.8 \nCurrent account balance (% of GDP)  4.5  4.4 \nPoverty incidence (% of families)  26.9   \nUnemployment rate (%)   7.9  7.3 \nDubai oil prices, average (US$/bbl)  61.5  68.3 \nP/$ exchange Rate  51.3  46.1 \n(=)negative; GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: National Statistical Coordination Board, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Department of Finance \n \n \n3.  Investment Showed Signs of Recovery in 2007. After rapidly expanding in the first \nhalf of the 1990s, investment growth in the Philippines slumped following the Asian financial \ncrisis and has been slow to recover, which has been a common characteristic of all the other \ncrisis-hit countries in the region since 1998. The Philippines\u2019 gross investment, both public and \n                                                 \n1 Contributors: the governments of Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n \n ", "2   \nprivate, was the equivalent of 23% of its GDP before the crisis, but this had declined to 14.5% in \n2006. Lost investments have translated into lost growth, and in turn to the slow creation of jobs \nand missed opportunities for poverty reduction. The decline in investment covered both private \nand public investments. However, investment spending increased in 2007 for the first time in 10 \nyears, growing by 11.8% over the previous year, which was well above the average annual \ngrowth rate of 0.8% from 1997 to 2006. Overall, the gross investment to GDP ratio improved \nfrom 14.5% in 2006 to 15.3% in 2007. ADB staff estimates suggest that the Philippines is under-\ninvesting in physical capital by as much as five percentage points of GDP when compared with \nits long run equilibrium rate.  \n \n4.  Economic Challenges in 2008. The Philippines economy in 2008 has been affected by \nthree  adverse  developments  in  the  external  environment:  (i)  commodity  and  fuel  price \nincreases, (ii) the financial sector knock-on effects from the United States (US), and (iii) the \nunfolding US and global economic slowdown. In recent months, economic data out of the US, \nEurope, and Japan confirms that the crisis has moved from the financial sector and into the real \neconomy. The external shocks from the global financial crisis and economic slowdown have yet \nto fully impact economic conditions in the Philippines.   \n \n5.  In the first half of 2008, the surge in international food and energy prices has contributed \nto higher domestic inflation. Inflation in the Philippines hit a 17-year high of 12.5% in August \n2008 on a year-on-year basis, with rice prices increasing by 45%. Although global commodity \nprices have started to ease, including rising prospects for a benign oil price environment, current \nlevels remain historically high. Food supply and price levels, particularly those of rice, continue \nto  be  a  priority  concern  for  the  Philippines  given  its  immediate  impact  on  the  poor.  The \neconomic growth rate of 4.6% in the first half of 2008 (from 7.6% in the first half of 2007) \nsuggests that these adverse effects are beginning to affect the real economy. In addition, the \nextent of the global financial crisis and its impact on the real sector remains to be seen. The \nlatest Asian Development Outlook estimates GDP growth in the Philippines at 4.5% in 2008 and \n4.7% in 2009.2 \n \nB.  Development Strategies and the Government\u2019s Justice Sector Reform Program \n6.  The  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan  (MTPDP)  2004\u20132010  sets  out  the \ncountry\u2019s development priorities, policy agenda, and programs. The plan includes an extensive \ndiscussion on the rule of law and the needed governance reforms in justice sector institutions. \nThe MTPDP envisions a judiciary that is independent, effective, and efficient. It also envisions \ncollaborative governance reforms among the five pillars of the criminal justice system, namely, \nthe courts, prosecution, law enforcement, rehabilitation and correction, and the community; with \nthe community pillar providing overall monitoring. Supporting key reforms of the MTPDP is the \nPhilippines Development Forum, the primary  mechanism of the Government for facilitating \nsubstantive policy dialogue among stakeholders. The Philippines Development Forum created a \nworking group on good governance and anti-corruption,3 where consensus on and commitments \nto the rule of law continue to be discussed and monitored. \n \n7.  Justice Sector Reform Strategies. There have been four phases of justice sector \nreform since 1986 (A detailed description of justice reforms appears in Appendix 4: Sector \nAnalysis).  The  first  phase  of  reform  measures  followed  the  1986  EDSA  revolution,  which \ncreated  a  sound  constitutional  basis  for  an  effective  justice  system,  helped  restore  the \nindependence of the judiciary, and initiated a continuing justice reform effort. A second phase of \nreform during the 1990s concentrated on strengthening the human and institutional capabilities \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 2008. Asian Development Outlook Update. Manila. \n3 This working group is currently chaired by the Philippines\u2019 Office of the Ombudsman and co-chaired by ADB. \n ", "  3\nthat were required to respond to the increased workload and growing number of reforms in the \njudiciary and other justice sector agencies. A third phase began with the Supreme Court\u2019s \nimplementation of its Action Program for Judicial Reform (APJR), a multi-year plan (2000\u20132006) \nthat identified, prioritized, and implemented judicial reforms. The APJR was regarded as a \nconcrete step in establishing a strong foundation for the long-term development of the judiciary. \nIt aimed at strengthening the judiciary\u2019s accountability, fiscal autonomy, and independence from \nexternal interference; and supported the delivery of fair and speedy justice. The APJR also \nreceived strong support from the executive branch. By the end of the APJR, the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s credibility had increased. Respondents to a survey of businesses who considered the \nSupreme Court sincere in fighting corruption increased from a net of 40% in 2006 to a net of \n46% in 2007.4 Equally important is APJR\u2019s production of a series of diagnostic studies that \nprovided the basis for policy reforms in the Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of the \nOmbudsman, the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, and the Philippine corrections system. The diagnostic \nstudies provided the opportunity for these nonjudicial justice sector agencies to build their own \nreform road maps. As a result, DOJ created a Management Systems Office to coordinate its \nreform  program,  the  Office  of  the  Ombudsman  adopted  a  Medium-Term  Anticorruption \nProgram, and the Philippine National Police (PNP) launched its own reform program.   \n \n8.  A fourth phase of reforms was initiated upon the current chief justice\u2019s assumption of the \noffice in 2006. The chief justice announced three broad priority areas for the judiciary: (i) \nseeking the speedy and efficient resolution of court cases, (ii) improving the court\u2019s integrity, \nand (iii) increasing access to justice. The chief justice also continues to focus on APJR reforms \nthat are expected to achieve results in these areas, by piloting a decentralized regional court \nadministration structure; designating 22 small claims courts using judicial dispute resolution; and \ndeploying mobile court units under the Justice on Wheels Program. The chief justice has not \nabandoned interest in coordinating justice reforms. Since his appointment, he has hosted two \nmultisectoral summits, both of which were lauded for demonstrating justice sector leadership. \nImproved coordination is expected to continue, particularly after the signing of a memorandum \nof agreement among the executive, legislative, and the judicative branches to establish the \nJudiciary, Executive, and Legislative Advisory and Consultative Council on 13 May 2008. The \ncouncil aims to develop a cooperative approach to resolving issues relating primarily to the \nbudget of the judiciary in a manner that respects judicial independence. Other justice sector \nagencies\u2014notably, DOJ and PNP\u2014continue to implement components of their own reform \nprograms, focusing on the efficient and effective delivery of services and agency integrity. \n \nC.  The Government and Its ADB Partnership \n9.  Country Strategy and Program. Justice sector and rule of law are themes of the \ninvestment climate component of the country strategy and program for 2005\u20132007,5 which \nemphasizes that ADB will help the Government to improve the investment climate through a \ncombination of technical and program support for policy, institutional, and regulatory reform in \nkey  sectors.  The  ADB\u2019s  focus  on  governance,  macroeconomic  and  public  expenditure \nmanagement,  and  anticorruption  in  the  Philippines  is  anchored  in  the  Development  Policy \nSupport Program, which both complements and reinforces the GJSRP and ADB\u2019s other sector \nloan programs and projects that are aligned with government strategies. The Development \nPolicy  Support  Program  sets  out  broad  policy  outcomes  for  improving  public  expenditure \nmanagement, but leaves its introduction to sector programs such as the Local Government \nFinance and Budget Reform Program and the proposed GJSRP. The proposed GJSRP will \nsupport  increased  budget  resources  to  the  justice  sector  and  improved  expenditure \n                                                 \n4 Social Weather Station Survey of Enterprises on Corruption 2006-2007, July 2007. \n5 These themes continue to be relevant in the country operations business plan for the Philippines (ADB. 2008. \nCountry Operations Business Plan (2008-2010). Manila. \n ", "4   \nmanagement  through  the  introduction  of  the  operational  performance  indicators  framework \n(OPIF), MTEP, and internal controls for better justice service delivery, all of which are key \noutcomes and outputs of the Government\u2019s national priorities. \n \n10.  Policy Dialogue. ADB\u2019s engagement with the Government on governance reforms, and \nthe justice sector in particular, began in the late 1980s as the Philippines embarked on its \ndemocratization  effort  and  constitutional  reforms.  ADB  assistance  included  support  for \nregulatory oversight bodies, macroeconomic and fiscal stability, public financial management \nreform, local government fiscal and budget reform, and strengthening the judiciary and justice \nsector. ADB\u2019s partnership in the justice sector started with the judiciary led by the Supreme \nCourt, which adopted the APJR in 2001 following a series of diagnostic studies that identified \nmajor challenges to the judiciary\u2019s integrity, competence, and efficiency. Policy dialogue and \npreparations for the GJSRP formally commenced in 2006.  \n \n11.  In 2001, ADB provided a technical assistance grant (TA 3693-PHI) to the judiciary to \nassist in developing frameworks and systems to strengthen the judiciary\u2019s independence and \naccountability; improve the judicial appointments system; and promote judicial training. Among \nthe  key  outcomes  of  this  engagement  have  been  the  design  of  a  decentralized  court \nadministration system, which is currently being piloted by the Supreme Court in Region 7;6 and \nthe creation of a financial management and administration office, and research positions in the \nJudicial and Bar Council (JBC), all of which were recommended by the TA and intended to \nimprove JBC capability to independently select qualified judicial candidates. In 2006, ADB \napproved TA 4832-PHI to support the Supreme Court\u2019s implementation of the recommendations \nfrom ADB TA 3693-PHI regarding decentralization of administrative and financial management \nfunctions in the judiciary. The TA is currently supporting the pilot testing of a regional court \nadministration office in Region 7 that was launched by the current chief justice in May 2008, and \nengaged in full operations for all courts in the region beginning in July 2008. The TA also \nsupported reforms in nonjudicial justice sector agencies that had been identified by Supreme \nCourt diagnostic studies as agencies whose performance had an impact on judicial efficiency. A \nsustainable capacity-building program for members of the National Prosecution Service (NPS) \nof the DOJ has been designed and implemented. Inputs for a design of a prosecution case \nmanagement system were also developed and are currently used in the DOJ\u2019s design of such a \nsystem.7    \n \n12.  Recognizing the Philippines\u2019 improved macroeconomic performance since 2005, ADB \nhas moved to a high-case lending scenario. Aligned with government priorities and directions, \nthe 2008 program reflects a mix of policy-based and project loans that broaden support from \nfiscal consolidation to other key development constraints relating to the investment climate, \ngovernance and social sectors; and provides direct support for accelerated achievements of the \nMillennium Development Goals. \n \n13.  The proposed GJSRP is one of three pillars of policy-based operations for institutional \nstrengthening  that  anchors  ADB\u2019s  policy  operations  in  the  Philippines.  The  other  two  are \nfocused  on  fiscal  and  public  expenditure  management:  the  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram and the Local Government Finance and Budget Reform Program.8 Figure 1 illustrates  \n                                                 \n6 Region 7, the Central Visayas region of the Philippines, comprise the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental \nand Siquijor. \n7 ADB. 2001.

The Medium-Term Program Approach. The proposed GJSRP will support the broad \npriorities of the Government\u2019s justice sector reform measures, including institutional capacity \nbuilding, as highlighted in the development policy letter addressed to the President of ADB \n(Appendix  2).  These broad  areas  include  (i)  strengthening  judicial  fiscal  autonomy,  justice \nsector  accountability,  and  improved  access  to  resources  of  justice  sector  agencies;  (ii) \nenhancing the integrity of justice sector personnel; (iii) supporting the governance and efficiency \nof justice sector agencies; (iv) expanding access to justice by the poor and vulnerable groups, \nwith a specific focus on addressing gender-based discriminatory practices and gender gaps; \nand (v) expanding the delivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution. In addition, it \nprovides (i) a coherent reform strategy with two discrete, but linked, subprograms within a \n ", "6   \nmedium-term framework for the justice sector; (ii) a strong emphasis on performance, as the \ndecision on whether to proceed with the next subprogram depends on satisfactory achievement \nof defined triggers; and (iii) flexibility in the reform measures, with provisions for incorporating \nlessons learned and responding to changes in the external environment, and new priorities in \nthe design of the subsequent subprogram. The GJSRP has the following two phases:  \n \n(i)  Subprogram 1 of the program cluster focuses on increasing resources to the \njustice  sector  and  supporting  the  efficient  delivery  of  justice  services.  It  is \ndesigned as a two-tranche operation with equal amounts of $150 million in 2008 \nand 2009. The tranche structure for subprogram 1 serves as a commitment \ndevice  and  platform  for  the  judicial  and  the  executive  branches  to  reach  a \nconsensus on key issues regarding (i) a coordinated approach to reforms in the \njustice sector spanning all relevant agencies, while respecting their constitutional \nmandates and autonomy; and (ii) increased funding for the judiciary. \n \n(ii)  Subprogram  2  will  focus  on  institutional  capacity  building  to  deliver  justice \nservices to the community, and implementing measures to address key priorities \nof the justice sector, including decentralizing the court\u2019s financial management \nand administrative functions to regional court administration offices, improving \nthe integrity of the court and other justice sector agencies, and improving access \nto justice.  \n \n15.  Subprogram 2 will address the key risks identified in subprogram 1\u2014particularly in \nrelation to sustaining support for increasing the share of the justice sector in the Government\u2019s \nbudget\u2014and  make  progress  in  other  areas  that  might  emerge  from  policy  dialogue  and \nengagement with the Government from 2009 to 2011. The expected time frame for processing \nsubprogram 2 is approximately 30 months after subprogram 1 becomes effective (i.e., 2011). \nSubprogram 2 contains eight policy triggers to provide the flexibility needed to respond to \nunanticipated changes in the external environment by framing an appropriate policy response. \nThis approach will ensure the program cluster is synchronized with the Government\u2019s policy \nagenda and the crafting of the new medium-term plan in 2011.  \n \n16.  Government  and  Development  Partner  Coordination.  Philippine  justice  sector \nreforms have been supported by development partners other than ADB. The United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) played a key role in the background technical work and \nbaselines of the APJR. The World Bank\u2019s Judicial Reform Support Program supported judiciary-\nfocused reforms, including information technology and infrastructure needs, as well as integrity-\nfocused  initiatives.  The  World  Bank,  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID),  and  Canadian  International  Development  Agency  (CIDA)  have  all  supported  the \ndevelopment of caseflow management and/or case management information systems in the \njudiciary. CIDA and The Asia Foundation, with funding from USAID, have also focused on \nalternative dispute resolution (court-annexed mediation), access to justice, and prison reforms. \nThe European Commission focused on access to justice reforms, while the Australian Agency \nfor  International  Development  (AusAID)  provided  human  resource  training  support.  The \nJapanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided training for various justice sector \nagencies and assisted in the operation of an automated fingerprint identification system at the \nPNP. (Appendix 3: Development Partners\u2019 Coordination Matrix gives a detailed description of \ndevelopment partners\u2019 support to the Philippine justice sector).   \n \n ", "  7\nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Governance in the Philippines \n17.  In the Philippines, the key binding constraints to ensuring sustained growth and poverty \nreduction were identified in an ADB study9\u2014and earlier in the country strategy and program\u2014as \nrelating  to  macroeconomic  stability,  high  transaction  costs  of  doing  business,  inadequate \ninfrastructure, and weak investor confidence. These constraints have been partly shaped by \ngovernance and corruption concerns. The judiciary and justice sector agencies are engaged in \nthe delivery of justice. As such, they perform a critical governance and oversight function by \nidentifying and reviewing public and private sector actions that violate the law. Figure 2 outlines \nthe entry points for governance reform supported by ADB. In the dynamics of the reform \nprocess, the supply and demand for good governance are considered important features in \nbuilding  strong  institutions  that  provide  quality  public  service  delivery.  To  illustrate,  ADB\u2019s \noperation in the Philippines include: a focus on supply side factors by strengthening human and \nfinancial resources and public financial management needed to deliver public services; and \ndemand-led \u201cvoice\u201d and empowerment elements to strengthen accountability arrangements.  A \nvibrant  civil  society  coupled  with  measures  in  support  of  transparency  and  accountability \nprovides  an  incentive  to  change  behavior  and  improve  public  service  performance  of \ngovernment institutions. Civil society and NGO stakeholders play an important role in sustaining \npolicy dialogue on justice sector reforms. These groups hold strong interests that protect the \nreforms from state capture. These groups\u2019 advocacy during policy dialogue makes the justice \nsector and state actions more responsive to the needs of its users. \n \n18.  Good Governance Performance. The Philippines suffers from the perception of poor \ngovernance  as  captured  in  investment  climate  and  governance  surveys,  and  international \ncomparisons. Progress is being made in macroeconomic management and fiscal stability but \nother indicators, including those of corruption, have deteriorated. In its report, Governance \nMatters  1996\u20132007:  Worldwide  Governance  Indicators,  the  World  Bank  has  noted  three \nfeatures of governance and corruption in the Philippines based upon an assessment of various \npublished indicators.10 First, the Philippines has experienced deterioration in most governance \nand corruption indicators since 1998; bottoming out in 2004, and improving since 2005, with the \nexception of indicators for corruption and political stability, which continue to decline (Table 2). \nSecond,  while  the  Philippines  scores  well  on  indicators  of  the  quality  of  legislative  and \nregulatory governance frameworks, it scores less well on the implementation of such laws and \npublic service delivery. Finally, the Philippines fares well in regional comparisons for most \nindicators, except for corruption and political stability indicators (Table 3). \n \n19.  Impact of Governance on Economic Growth. Weak institutions contributed to the \nPhilippines\u2019 lower-than-average economic growth performance. A study on Philippine economic \ngrowth over the last 35 years suggested that while Philippines growth performance has been \naverage compared to all other developing economies, it has performed below average in the \nSoutheast Asia region, which was attributed to weak institutions.11 The 2003 ADB and World \nBank Investment Climate Survey identified corruption as the second most severe constraint to \ninvestment, behind macroeconomic stability.12 The analysis of cross-country data in this survey \nshowed that if a country raises its governance ratings to international averages for political \nstability, corruption, and the rule of law, this would be a sufficient step to change investor \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2007.

Governance Matters 1996\u20132007: Worldwide Governance Indicators, Washington, DC. \n \nB.  Sector Description and Performance  \n20.  The Philippine justice system consists of a network of institutions, including the judiciary \nand the several justice sector agencies under the executive branch of the Government. The \nexecutive branch agencies implement the laws, investigate violations, prosecute crimes, and \nenforce penalties; and the judiciary interprets the law, hears cases, resolves disputes, and \nreviews government actions. The executive and judicial branches are co-equal and separate, \nand together with the legislative branch, they each exercise powers that check and balance the \npowers of the other two. Under the executive branch and judiciary, the agencies constituting the \njustice system include the following: law enforcers and investigators, public defenders, solicitors, \nprosecutors, various levels of courts, and penal institutions. Although the core of the justice \nsystem is the judiciary\u2014as the branch of government ultimately responsible for interpreting the \nlaw\u2014a  well-functioning  justice  system  also  relies  on  the  capacities,  performance,  and \ncoordination  of  the  justice  sector  institutions  in  the  executive  branch  (Appendix  4,  Sector \nAnalysis). \n \nTable 3: Regional Comparison of Governance Indicators in 2007 \nCountry  Voice and  Political  Government  Regulatory  Rule of  Control of \n  Accountability  Stability  Effectiveness  Quality  Law  Corruption \n Philippines  43.3  10.1  56.4  50.5  33.8  22.2 \n Indonesia   42.8  14.9  41.7  43.7  27.1  27.1 \n Malaysia   31.3  52.4  82.9  67.0  65.2  62.3 \nThailand   29.8  16.8  61.6  56.3  52.9  44.0 \nViet Nam   6.7  56.3  41.2  35.9  38.6  28.0 \nCambodia  24.0  28.8  20.9  30.6  13.8  8.2 \nLao PDR  6.3  42.8  21.3  15.0  17.1  13.0 \nLao PDR = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. \nSource: World Bank 2008.

A common perception in the Philippines is that \nthe quality of the rule of law leaves much to be desired. The justice system is often cited as a \ncontributing factor to the low comparative rankings of the Philippines on a number of widely-\nknown indices of economic competitiveness. In addition, the American Bar Association has also \nexpressed concerns over inefficiency in the justice system. While reforms have helped improve \nthe credibility of justice sector institutions\u2014particularly the Supreme Court, and more recently, \nPNP\u2014cross-cutting issues persist.

Manila  \n \n \n22.  The Vicious Cycle of Poor Governance. Informed observers attribute the persistence \nof underperformance in the justice sector to several factors. The immediate cause is inadequate \nresources and support facilities, and low remuneration, which inhibit the hiring and retention of \nqualified staff while concurrently providing strong incentives for corruption. This situation breeds \na vicious cycle of (i) limited implementation capacities in justice sector agencies, including the \nlimited capacity to manage change and to manage for results; (ii) inadequate investment in \nincreasing  capacities;  and  (iii)  weak  accountability,  both  in  the  sense  of  accountability  for \nmeeting performance targets and accountability for the use of resources, which have both \nimpeded implementation of corrective actions in a timely manner. The absence of sufficient \npolitical consensus that the benefits of improved performance in the justice system would \noutweigh the costs and risks has also contributed to this difficult environment.  \n \n23.  Application of Governance Principles. The application of governance principles for \npublic sector service delivery provides the entry point to turn the vicious cycle described in para. \n22 into a virtuous circle. These principles include (i) incentives to provide high-quality service \ndelivery  through  competitive  salaries  and  sufficient  budgets  for  investments  in  training, \ninformation systems, and related facilities, (ii) enhanced accountability for performance against \nclear benchmarks, (iii)  improved accountability and transparency mechanisms for the use of \nresources through strong public financial management systems, and (iv) effective and wide-\nranging civic participation to provide feedback and monitor the reform process.  \n \n ", "  11\n \n \n24.  The fundamental change required in a complex environment such as the justice sector \ninvolves a slow and arduous process. It is important to focus on key areas and build sufficient \ncapacity and consensus necessary for reforms. At the same time, a comprehensive approach is \nneeded to address the issues, problems, constraints, and complex relationships of supervision \nand control across the network of justice sector institutions. The proposed GJSRP offers a road \nmap of critical short-term actions and medium-term policy reforms that will require concerted \neffort from all of the concerned stakeholders.  \n \nC.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.  Judicial Fiscal Autonomy, Justice Sector Accountability and Access to \nResources \n25.  Judicial  Independence  and  Fiscal  Autonomy.  An  independent  judiciary  is  a  key \nfeature of an efficient justice sector. Judicial independence refers to a judiciary deciding \nmatters impartially \u201cwithout improper influences, direct or indirect, from any source.\u201d14 One \nof the key features to ensure judicial independence is the provision of adequate resources \nto the judiciary and to allow the judiciary to manage the resources. In the Philippines, courts \nobtain financing from three major sources: the national government budget, contributions from \nlocal government units (LGUs), and revenues from judicial fees and charges. However, the \ncourts\u2019 principal source of financing is the national government budget. To protect the judiciary \nfrom being unduly influenced by the executive branch, which proposes the budget, or legislative \nbranch,  which  approves  the  budget,  the  Constitution  grants  the  judiciary  fiscal  autonomy \nthrough  the  automatic  and  regular  release  of  its  budget  once  it  has  been  approved  by \nCongress.15 In addition, the Constitution states that the judiciary\u2019s budget may not be reduced by \nCongress below the amount appropriated for the previous year.16  However the fiscal austerity \nmeasures  of  the  national  government  from  2003  to  2006,  weak  public  expenditure \nmanagement, and reliance on funding from LGUs have combined to undermine fiscal autonomy \nof the judiciary. \n26.  Excessive Controls and Issues on Cash Release. The national government budget \nallocation process starts when the President, through the Department of Budget Management \n(DBM), prepares and submits to Congress an annual National Expenditure Program on the \nbasis  of  which  a  national  budget  is  appropriated.  In  the  course  of  preparing  the  National \nExpenditure  Program,  DBM  reviews  the  budget  proposals  of  all  government  agencies\u2014\nincluding  the  judiciary,  legislature,  the  executive  (Office  of  the  President),  and  fiscally-\nautonomous constitutional commissions\u2014on a line-item basis and decides which items may or \nmay not be included in the National Expenditure Program.17 The House of Representatives files \na General Appropriations Bill that cannot increase the appropriations recommended by the \nexecutive. Once the General Appropriations Bill passes into law, DBM allots the judiciary\u2019s \nbudget in one lump sum. Ideally, DBM would disburse the judiciary\u2019s budget automatically, \nwithout conditions and on a regular basis, as required under the Constitution. However, as with \nexecutive departments under the supervision and control of the President, the judiciary has \nbeen subjected to cash availability timing issues and the fiscal position of the Government. The \nfailure to automatically and regularly release cash to the judiciary is one of the main factors that \n                                                 \n14 The Beijing Statement of Principles of the Independence of the Judiciary in the LawAsia Region. This is an \ninternational document signed by 32 chief justices from throughout the Asia Pacific region including the Philippines. \n15  Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution; Supreme Court v. DBM, G.R. No. 158791, 10 February 2006. \n16 Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution.  \n17 It will be noted that both the president and the chief justice have the statutory authority to realign resources and   \naugment items within the budget of their government branch, but only if the budget items exist in the first place. \n ", "12   \nrenders  the  judiciary  unable  to  reasonably  manage  its  own  resources  and  have  enough \nflexibility to adequately manage day-to-day operations. Failing to receive the resources that it \nneeds in a timely manner, leaves the judiciary vulnerable to negotiating budget items with the \nexecutive  branch  on  a  transaction-by-transaction  basis,  thereby  posing  risks  to  its \nindependence and integrity.  \n27.  The Government\u2019s fiscal management capabilities\u2014particularly in budget planning\u2014can \nplay an important role in strengthening fiscal autonomy, notwithstanding government budget \nconstraints. Ideally, a well planned operational cash program would allow DBM to plan for the \ndisbursement of cash to fiscally-autonomous priority agencies, such as the judiciary, without \nreferring  to  the  Government\u2019s  fiscal  position or  reviewing  the  agencies\u2019  expenditures  as a \nprecondition to releasing cash allocations. However, weak fiscal management capabilities and \nhuman  resource  constraints  in  the  Supreme  Court  have  resulted  in  the  preparation  of \noperational cash programs that do not reflect the actual cash requirements of the Supreme \nCourt each quarter. This makes it difficult for DBM to program a realistic schedule of cash \ndisbursements for the judiciary and other fiscally-autonomous agencies, especially when the \nGovernment\u2019s fiscal position is weak.  \n28.  Real Decline in Resources. While the nominal level of the judiciary\u2019s budget can be \nprotected by the Constitution, the increases have not always been sufficient to protect against \ninflation. Figure 4 illustrates that while there have been annual increases in the judiciary\u2019s \nobligated  budget  in  recent  years,  its  value  in  real  terms  and  its  share  of  the  National \nExpenditure Program has decreased. While there was a slight recovery in the budget allocation \nin  real  terms  in  2007,  it  was  not  enough  to  meet  the  increasing  demands  of  the  courts\u2019 \nincreasing workload. In fact, the budget allocation for the judiciary in 2007 was able to buy 5% \nless goods and services when compared with the judiciary\u2019s budget in 2000. With national \ngovernment budgetary resources inadequate, the courts must turn to other sources to finance \ntheir operations.  \n    \n  Figure 4\n        Suppressed Spending for the Judiciary\n            (budget adjusted for inflation and indexed to 100 in 2000)\n  105  1.2  %\n  100  1   of G\n  B o\n    udget Index 899505    000...468    vernment Bu\n  d\ng\ne\n  80  0.2  t\n  2000  2001  2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n \n  Spending adjusted for inflation Share of Government budget \n \n \n29.  Judiciary  Development  Fund.  In  1984,  Presidential  Decree  No.  1949  created  the \nJudiciary Development Fund (JDF) in recognition of the need to provide the judiciary with some \nform of fiscal independence. The JDF is funded by court fees and other revenue collected by \n ", "  13\nthe courts.18 By statute, at least 80% of the JDF is allocated to finance cost-of-living allowances \nfor court personnel and not more than 20% may be used for office equipment and other court \nfacilities. Although the Supreme Court sets the rates for court fees and has sole responsibility \nfor collection, the JDF cannot serve as a major source of funds and revenue, as issues such as \naccess to justice and equal treatment under the law need to be given due consideration in the \nsetting and collection of fees. At best, the JDF merely augments the judiciary\u2019s resources. The \nbulk of the judiciary\u2019s resources must still come from the Government\u2019s budget.  \n \n30.  Local Government and the Judiciary. Many LGUs contribute resources to the lower \ncourts located in their respective area of responsibility.19 These contributions are not recorded in \nthe financial accounting records of the judiciary. LGUs vary considerably in their policies about \ncontributions  to  local  courts  as  well  as  in  the  amounts  provided.  Some  LGUs  include \ncontributions to local courts in their annual budgets, but most do not. These schemes run the \nrisk of undermining the integrity of the courts, a risk that is further heightened by the absence of \nmodern financial and expenditure management systems and capabilities within the judiciary. \n \n31.  Weakness  in  Judicial  Administration.  With  inadequate  budgetary  resources,  the \nquality  of  judicial  administration  suffers.  The  severe  lack  of  administrative  and  financial \nmanagement,  and  technical  infrastructure  hampers  the  efficiency  of  the  reporting  and \naccounting process. This has contributed to the perception that the judiciary is not forthcoming \nabout its use of their resources, including the JDF, even as past audits by the Commission on \nAudit have confirmed the proper accounting and transparency of the JDF. International best \npractices  and  principles  of  financial  management  may  be  useful  in  preventing  a  negative \nperception of the courts, as well as in ensuring the judiciary\u2019s accountability to the public for its \nperformance and use of resources.20 \n \n32.  Resource Constraints in Nonjudicial Agencies. Nonjudicial agencies suffer the same \nbudgetary constraints as the judiciary. In general, while annual budgetary allocations increase in \nnominal terms, the real value of the budgetary allocation has decreased. Between 2000 and \n2007, the total budget in real terms for nonjudicial agencies dropped by about 5%, with DOJ \nexperiencing the largest decline of about 15%.  \n \n33.  In addition to its effect on the judiciary, budgetary constraints have also had a significant \nimpact on the quality of public service provided by other justice sector agencies, as follows: \n \n(i)  There  are  insufficient  resources  for  PNP  field  offices.  At  present,  PNP  field \noffices receive less than one-fourth of the programmed amounts required to \nsupport police operations in the field. Police officers responding to crimes do not \nhave the basic equipment and materials necessary to cordon off the crime scene. \nThey have to wait for specialized teams who perform crime scene investigation. \nDue to budget constraints, there are very few such teams that are authorized to \n                                                 \n18 In addition to regular court fees, the other legal fees comprising the JDF include bar examination fees, interest on \ndeposits of the judiciary\u2019s funds, confiscated bail bonds, income from the publications of the Supreme Court    \nprinting press, and rental fees for the use of judiciary facilities. \n19 Under the provisions of the local government code, LGUs are allowed to support the judiciary on a discretionary \nbasis. LGU contributions vary considerably and include office equipment, supplies and materials, augmentation of \njudicial allowances, additional personnel, office repairs, travel and training allowances, and advances on utility \nfees. In low-income LGUs, the contributions ranged from P1, 000 to P9, 546 per month. In first class provinces, it \nranged from 0.02% to 0.95% of the LGU\u2019s revenues. In large cities, it ranged from 0.05% to 1.35% of the LGU\u2019s \nrevenues. Contributions to the prosecution service and the PNP have also been reported. \n20 ADB is in close coordination with the World Bank in relation to World Bank\u2019s recent report on procurement capacity \nassessment and the ACPI Evaluation Report for the Judiciary (unpublished as of July 2008). \n ", "14   \nprocess crime scenes. As a result, the quality of collecting evidence in crime \nscenes suffers. \n(ii)  There has been a considerable increase in the jail population in recent years, \nand there are insufficient resources available to provide prisoners reasonable \nliving standards and adequate correction and rehabilitation services. It is striking \nthat more than 95% of the jail population has not been sentenced, which means \nthat less than 5% of detainees are serving sentences following conviction in \ncourt. From about 35,000 in 2000, the number of detainees in Bureau of Jail \nManagement and Penology (BJMP) jails grew to more than 62,000 in 2006. \nAbout 10% of detainees are women, and 2% are minors. Metro Manila jails \nreportedly  hold  400  times  more  prisoners  than  their  official  capacity.  A \nrehabilitation center in the province of Cebu that was built for 400 detainees was \nuntil recently crammed with 2,600 (Appendix 4, Sector Analysis).  \n(iii)  NPS has insufficient resources to fund and sustain an orientation program that \nwould increase the competence and efficiency of new hires. A training facility has \nbeen made available to the NPS, but remains unutilized because there are no \nresources to finance the program plus staff, furniture, and equipment. NPS and \nthe Public Attorney\u2019s Office can offer only occasional training courses, which are \noften dependent upon international financial support.  \n \n34.  Squeezed  Discretionary  Spending  on  the  Justice  Sector.  Inadequate  budgetary \nresources have led justice sector agencies to prioritize recurrent expenses (primarily personnel) \nand fund all other expenses with whatever resources remain. Consequently, more than 80% of \njustice sector agencies\u2019 budgets go to salaries, leaving less than 15% for maintenance and \nother operating expenses, and less than 3% for capital investment. This deviates from the \nprofile  of  the  national  government  budget,  which  devotes  32%  to  expenses  for  personnel \nservices and around 58% to maintenance and other operating expenses (Figure 5).  \n \n \nFigure 5: Comparison of National Budget Appropriations between Justice Sector and the \n \nRest of Government \n \n \n \n    Government  Justice Sector \nCapital Outlays \n   \n                 10%              MOE   Capital Outlays 3% \n    Salaries               15% \n32% \n   \n                 MOE  Salaries \n                 58%  82% \n   \n   \n   \nMOE = maintenance and other operational expenses. \n \n   Note:  Entries include expenditures related to administration of justice that are identifiable in the GAA. \n  Source: General Appropriations Act (GAA), 2007. \n \n \n35.  Personnel  Vacancies.  Notwithstanding  the  fact  that  the  budget  of  justice  sector \ninstitutions are mostly devoted to staff salaries and allowances, justice sector compensation \nrates are not comparable to those received by private sector counterparts. For example, lawyers \nemployed in justice sector agencies receive salaries that are generally about one-fifth of private \nsector lawyers\u2019 salaries. New law graduates, who are unqualified to become judges, can obtain \nstarting salaries in private sector firms that are above those provided to judges. As a result, high \nvacancy rates persist in the courts, which contributes to increasing justice sector workloads. In \naddition, the employed staff working in the courts for comparatively-low compensation have \n ", "  15\nweak incentives to provide efficient and effective service. While there have been efforts to \nreduce judicial vacancies in the past 3 years, a further reduction in vacancies merits support. \n \n36.  In 2003, legislation authorized the payment of additional compensation (allowances) for \njudges, increasing basic salaries by 100% over 4 years.21 As a result, judicial vacancies have \ndecreased from one-in-every-three judicial positions to the current ratio of one-in-every-five \njudicial positions (Figure 6).  Together with a number of reforms targeted at improving court \nefficiencies (para. 41), this has led to a decrease in judicial caseloads (Figure 7). While this has \nbeen a favorable development for court personnel, it has caused wage imbalances across the \njustice sector. The MTPDP has observed that many prosecutors and Public Attorney\u2019s Office \nlawyers have left their positions to join the judiciary, while referring to resource and salary \ndifferentials as possible reasons for the transfer. This highlights the need to develop a sector-\nwide strategy that diminishes the risk of creating vacancies in one agency as a result of filling \nvacancies in another.   \n \n37.  Additional  judicial  allowances  are  funded  mainly  from  court  fees,  and  not  from  the \njudiciary\u2019s personnel services budget. Therefore, the amount of additional compensation is \ncontingent on the amount of court fees collected. It should be noted that in order to fund the \nadditional compensation the Supreme Court raised court fee levels. Similarly, extra allowances \nhave been legislated for lawyers in justice sector agencies (e.g., the NPS, Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral, and the Public Attorney\u2019s Office). In the instances of the NPS and Office of the Solicitor \nGeneral,  authorized  funding  for  these  allowances  comes  from  the  agencies\u2019  own  source \nrevenues,22 which decreases the likelihood that staff can receive the authorized allowances. The \nadditional allowances mandated under the law for Public Attorney\u2019s Office lawyers have yet to \nbe funded.  \n \n2.  Justice Sector Integrity and Higher Standards of Conduct \n38.  Enhancing  the  public\u2019s  perception  of  integrity  in  the  justice  system  is  a  serious \nchallenge. A recent business survey showed a high level of doubt about the sincerity of a \nnumber of justice sector agencies in fighting corruption.23 Most of the justice sector agencies \nappear to have satisfactory codes of ethical conduct in place or in development (e.g., the \njudiciary, PNP, and the NPS). However, knowledge of those codes among the relevant staff and \ngeneral public appears to be uneven.  The number of disciplinary cases seems small, given the \nlarge number of individuals involved in the administration of justice and the continued perception \nof widespread corruption. The American Bar Association, in its latest judicial reform survey for \nthe Philippines, pointed out that the \u201cdisciplinary process has adequate written criteria, specific \ndescriptions  of  misconduct,  and  a  fair  process.  However,  in  practice,  it  is  not  working \neffectively.\u201d 24 \n \n39.  Performance Monitoring. The problem points to a need for stronger measures for \nperformance monitoring and evaluation of the rules of conduct. The Supreme Court\u2019s annual \nreport for 2007 enumerated an increasing number of disciplinary actions imposed on judges and \ncourt personnel. In June 2008, the Supreme Court reprimanded and heavily fined a Pasig City \n                                                 \n21  Republic Act 9227, approved 23 October 2003. \n22 The Department of Justice will source its funds to implement the additional compensation from the fees it is \nauthorized to collect. Aside from the fees it is authorized to collect, the Office of the Solicitor General will source its \nfunds from 5% of the monetary awards given by the courts to its client government agencies \n23 2006\u20132007 Social Weather Station Surveys of Enterprises on Corruption, July 2007. Only the Supreme Court was \nidentified as having \u201cgood\u201d sincerity.

In 2008, the Supreme Court embarked on an integrity assessment tool: the review and \nenhancement of performance and integrity program. The review program is designed as a \npreventive  measure  to  reduce  opportunities  for  negative  organizational  behavior  by \nstrengthening institutional regulations, structures, systems, and procedures.25 Using a balanced \nscorecard and a tool to assess and strengthen performance and integrity, the review program \nfocused on policies, procedures, and practices related to performance management, human \nresource management, financial management, corruption risk management, internal reporting, \nand investigation of undesirable behavior. The review program recommended actions relating to \nprocurement  and  implementation  of  a  code  of  conduct  for  judiciary  employees,  a  formal \ngrievance and complaints system, and performance monitoring.26 In addition, a committee has \nbeen formed to revise the performance review, and evaluation and monitoring standards of the \nSupreme Court. With respect to other justice sector agencies, PNP has undergone a similar \nprocess through an integrity development review under the leadership of the Office of the \nOmbudsman.  \n \n41.  Civil  Society  Feedback  Mechanisms.  Nongovernment  organizations,  such  as  the \nSupreme Court Appointments Watch, aim to ensure that the selection of judges and justices is \nfair and transparent, and free from undue political influence. Nongovernment organizations can \nassist  in  holding  justice  sector  institutions  accountable  for  their  actions  and  raise  public \nconfidence in justice sector institutions and the rule of law.  \n                                                 \n25  Review  and  Enhancement  of  Performance  and  Integrity  has  identified  \u201chotspots\u201d  for  monitoring  among  \ndepartments of the judiciary, including departments responsible for procurement, disbursement, and recruitment, \namong others. This approach is similar to the Integrity Development Review program implemented by the Office of \nthe Ombudsman for all government agencies. Thus far, 18 agencies have undergone the Integrity Development \nReview.  Both the Review and Enhancement of Performance and Integrity and Integrity Development Review \nprograms are supported primarily by USAID, with strong support from development partners.

A major challenge to the justice system is the persistent perception of \ndelay in the delivery of justice. The courts handle a caseload of about 1,100,000 cases per year \nyet are able to dispose of only about 450,000 cases per year, resulting in an additional 650,000 \npending cases each year. Despite the decrease in the total caseloads in recent years (Figure 7), \nthe decline of case backlog has not been significant. In fact, the clearance rate (volume of cases \ndisposed of as a percentage of total caseload) remained low (about 39%) in the past 3 years, \nindicating that case backlog remains high. However, the disposition rate (number of cases \ndisposed of as a percentage of case inflow) has been increasing, indicating that the courts have \nshown gains in efficiency (Appendix 4, sector analysis). \n \n43.  Improvements in the disposition rate correlate with a number of reforms initiated under \nthe  APJR  to  increase  court  efficiency,  including  the  pilot  use  of  an  electronic  caseflow \nmanagement system in Pasay City courts, court-annexed mediation (discussed in para. 50), \nand  judicial  dispute  resolution  at  any  stage  of  litigation.  In  addition,  improvements  in  the \ndisposition rate also correlate with a decreasing vacancy in judicial positions, which was a \ndevelopment brought about by increasing judges total compensation by about 100% (discussed \nin para. 36). Additional reforms to increase judicial efficiency include the establishment of case \nmanagement information systems in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan (the \ncourt that adjudicates graft and corruption charges against high-level government officials), and \nCourt of Tax Appeals. \n \n44.  One reason that the backlog in the disposition of criminal cases remains high, even in \nthe midst of ongoing justice sector reforms, is that judicial performance is also affected by the \nperformance  of  other  justice  sector  agencies.  Delays  in  criminal  court  proceedings  have \nreportedly been caused in part by the nonappearance of witnesses, absence of prosecutors and \npublic defenders, and delays by law enforcement officers\u2019 in turning over evidence to the courts.  \n \n45.  With  regard  to  noncriminal  cases,  the  judiciary  has  recognized  alternative  dispute \nresolution as a means of encouraging speedy justice and reducing case backlog. The judiciary \nhas established the Philippine Mediation Center, which conducts court-annexed mediation, and \nprovided rules for the referral of a wide scope of cases that may be referred to court-annexed \nmediation  at  any  time  during  litigation.  A  more  effective  alternative  dispute  resolution  and \nmediation process at the barangay (village) level, the barangay justice system, has also proven \nto contribute to reducing case backlog. The barangay justice system settled more than 4 million \ncases between 1980 and 2005, with an average of about 150,000 cases per year. This number \nhas grown to about 300,000 cases per year recently and the percentage of mediated cases that \nwere settled has remained consistently high.27  \n \n46.  In spite of these initiatives, the perception that the delivery of justice is regularly delayed \nstill prevails. The interrelated nature of justice sector agencies\u2019 operations requires that delays \nbe  prevented  or  reduced  at  all  stages\u2014investigation,  dispute  resolution,  and  enforcement. \nAlthough the Constitution and laws impose time limits on the judiciary with respect to deciding \ncases, there are generally no similar provisions for other justice sector agencies involved, \nparticularly  when  the  likelihood  of  a  delay  occurring  is  high,  such  as  the  enforcement  of \njudgments. As a result, even if it were assumed that the courts were keeping within the time \nlimits imposed by the Constitution and the law, the perception of delays in the delivery of justice \nwould continue to exist if accused individuals were detained for long periods in police facilities or \n                                                 \n27  DILG summary of cases filed, actions taken, on Katarungang Pambarangay Implementation (from January 1980 to \nDecember 2005). \n ", "18   \nin district prisons while waiting for a complaint to be filed in court. For criminal cases, other \njustice sector agencies play a prominent role in bringing cases to the courts: DOF and BIR in \nthe investigation of criminal tax evasion cases, PNP in the processing of crime scenes, and DOJ \nin case preparation and prosecution. Consequently, the effective delivery of services by these \ninstitutions will ultimately contribute to the quality of the cases entering the court and help in the \nspeedy disposition and resolution of court cases.  \n \n47.  Financial Management, Planning, and Budgeting Capacities. There is a need to \nbuild  a  stronger  capacity  for  strategic  planning,  financial  management,  human  resource \ndevelopment, information management; and promote a culture of results-based performance \nmanagement within justice sector agencies. Successful implementation of justice sector reforms \ndemand  that  participating  agencies  are  able  to  live  up  to  their  responsibilities  by  relating \nbudgets  to  strategy,  meeting  objectives,  adapting  to  changing  circumstances,  monitoring \nperformance, and reporting on results.28 Weak budget planning and monitoring capabilities afflict \nall justice sector agencies. In addition, as budget planning is conducted at the central office of \njustice sector agencies, field offices and court stations have even weaker financial management \ncapabilities.  These  inherent  weaknesses,  the  absence  of  resources  to  exercise  stronger \noversight functions, and the dearth of transparent procedures and accountability mechanisms all \ncontribute to the perception that the agencies are susceptible to corruption. It also contributes to \nthe reluctance of the oversight agency, DBM, to provide greater flexibility and control over its \nresources.   \n \n48.  A key public expenditure management reform being implemented by the Government is \nthe OPIF, which is an approach to expenditure management that directs resources towards \nnational and departmental priorities and results in accordance with the Government\u2019s strategic \nplan. If effectively implemented, the OPIF clarifies roles, functions, and accountabilities between \nand among agencies, and accounts for their performance. With better internal governance \narrangements  and  systems  to  capture  performance  data,  agencies  are  provided  greater \nflexibility and control over their internal resource deployment.29 Although justice sector agencies \nunder the executive branch have adopted the OPIF and the Supreme Court has signified its \ncommitment, the widespread adoption and implementation of the OPIF will be a lengthy process \nthat  requires  significant  strengthening  of  justice  sector  agencies\u2019  financial  management \nsystems. Agencies in the justice sector will need to establish their own performance indicators \nand  strategize  the  best  way  of  reaching  their  respective  indicators.  The  development  of \nbenchmarks and reasonable indicators will be a challenge for many agencies that have never \nbefore engaged before in similar exercises. Some agencies, such as DOJ, that have adopted \nperformance indicators realize that they do not have the capability to monitor and collect data \nfrom their field offices (in DOJ\u2019s case, data from field prosecutors\u2019 offices) to determine whether \nor not they have reached their targets. In addition, measuring the efficient and effective delivery \nof justice requires both qualitative and quantitative measures.  \n \n49.  Overly-Centralized  Decision  Making.  Highlycentralized  administration  continues  to \ncharacterize the operation of justice sector agencies. The inefficiencies and delays inherent in \nthis system of centralized decision making and resource allocation have been associated with \nmany of the problems of poor infrastructure and inadequate operating systems. Within the \njudiciary, for example, all applications for a leave of absence need to be submitted to and \nprocessed  by  the  judiciary\u2019s  central  offices  in  Manila  regardless  of  where  the  request \n                                                 \n28  The findings draw from analytical work of ADB TA 3693 (ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the \nPhilippines for Strengthening the Independence and Defining the Accountability of the Judiciary. Manila) and ADB \nTA 4832 (ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Enhancing the Autonomy, \nAccountability, and Efficiency of the Judiciary, and Improving the Administration of Justice. Manila). \n29  See Organizational Performance Indicator Framework FY2007, DBM (August 2006). \n ", "  19\noriginated.30 In addition, centralization results in an inability to prepare for and respond to the \nmaintenance and other operating expenses and capital expenditure needs of field offices and \ncourt stations. Another example is PNP, where more than 95% of its appropriations from the \nnational budget are centrally managed, including salaries for police in the field, and less than \none  fourth  of  the  amount  supporting  police  operations  in  the  field  (e.g.,  investigation, \nintelligence, and police relations) are allocated to the field offices.   \n \n50.  A centralized administrative system hinders the efficient feedback of information from the \nfield offices to the central offices. For example, the judiciary\u2019s central offices require the trial \ncourts to submit reports that include a large number of tracking indicators. Because of the sheer \nvolume of these reports, the central offices are unable to monitor the performance of all the trial \ncourts. As a result, the Supreme Court is unable to use the reports to inform its decisions \nregarding  performance  improvement.  It  also  deprives  the  trial  courts  of  an  opportunity  to \ncompare their performance against that of their peers, and track their own improvement.  \n \n51.  On 14 November 2006, the Supreme Court issued an order to implement reforms to \nstrengthen  the  independence  and  fiscal  autonomy  of  the  judiciary  by  decentralizing  its \nadministrative and financial management functions through a pilot regional court administration \noffice, which was launched by the current chief justice in Region 7 in May 2008.31 A key feature \nof  the  decentralization  effort  was  the  creation  of  the  Judiciary  Autonomy  Fund,  which  is \nmanaged  and  controlled  by  the  chief  justice,  currently  through  the  Office  of  the  Court \nAdministrator. The fund is the source of all disbursements to support expenditures of the pilot \nregional court administration office and courts in the Seventh Judicial Region. The Supreme \nCourt resolved that all funds attributable to the pilot regional court office in Region 7 and for all \ncourts in the Seventh Judicial Region shall be deposited in the Judiciary Autonomy Fund. All \nfunds  accruing  to  the  Seventh  Judicial  Region  for  its  use  and  operation  by  virtue  of  any \nlegislation  or  contractual  agreement  (e.g.,  budgetary  appropriation  from  the  national \nGovernment, LGU contributions, fees collected by courts, and revenues from the use or rental \nof court assets) shall be deposited to the Judiciary Autonomy Fund. \n \n4.  Access to Justice by the Poor and Vulnerable Groups \n52.  The poor often lack awareness of their rights and are deterred by inconvenient and \nunaffordable access to formal justice sector institutions. An ADB study has shown that there is a \nstrong correlation between access to justice\u2014particularly legal empowerment activities\u2014and \npoverty reduction. A survey taken in agrarian reform communities in the Philippines showed that \nareas that have received legal empowerment training and paralegal assistance benefited from \nhigher levels of productivity, income, and farm investment.32  \n \n53.  The Constitution of the Philippines makes it the Government\u2019s duty to assure citizens \nfree access to the courts and adequate legal assistance that \u201cshall not be denied to any person \nby reason of poverty.\u201d33 The Supreme Court has tried to operationalize this by providing relevant \nprotections to the rights of the accused and providing free legal counsel to the poor in the Rules \nof  Court.34  The  Supreme  Court  has  also  adopted,  as  part  of  the  Code  of  Professional \n                                                 \n30  A pilot regional court administration office for the pilot in Region 7 has been set up to handle these requests in lieu \nof the central office in Manila. It began regular operations in July 2008.  \n31  Region 7, the Central Visayas region of the Philippines, comprise the provinces of Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental  \nand Siquijor. \n32  ADB. 2001. Law and Policy Reform at the Asian Development Bank: Legal Empowerment: Advancing Good \nGovernance and Poverty Reduction. Available:  \n     http://www.adb.org/Documents/Others/Law_ADB/lpr_2001.asp?p=lawdevt#contents \n33   Const. art. III, sec. 14. \n34   Rules of Court Rules 112\u2013127. \n ", "20   \nResponsibility  of  Lawyers,  rules  that  prohibit  lawyers  from  (i)  rejecting  the  case  of  the \ndefenseless or the oppressed, (ii) refusing to serve the needy, and (iii) declining an appointment \nas counsel de officio or a request from the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) to render free \nlegal aid.35 Under the APJR, the Supreme Court issued a rule that exempts the poor from paying \ndocket and other fees, including fees for the transcript of court proceedings kept by the court \nstenographer. In addition to the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, the IBP and a number of law schools \nand legal clinics provide free legal service to the poor and disadvantaged.36 \n \n54.  Gender Responsiveness. The Supreme Court and some justice sector agencies are \ncharacterized  by  maintaining  functioning  gender  and  development  committees  (e.g.,  the \nCommittee on Gender Responsiveness in the Judiciary at the Supreme Court, the Committee \non Gender and Development at DOJ, and the Human Rights Office at PNP) and related budgets \nand actions plans. The Supreme Court has a gender mainstreaming strategy that was finalized \nin 2007 after a gender assessment was carried out under the APJR. The assessment identified \nthe following key gender issues: (i) court processes, as well as processes of other justice sector \nagencies,  are  not  sensitive  to  the  conditions  and  circumstances  of  women  and  other \ndisadvantaged groups; (ii) although there have been a number of gender-sensitivity trainings for \njudges and other members of the court and the PNP, the justice sector staff has low awareness \nand  appreciation  of  gender  issues;  (iii)  women  currently  lack  economic  resources  and \nindependence, and the justice system is generally insensitive to the concerns of women and \ngirls; (iv) the lack of courts and/or judges, prosecutors, Public Attorney\u2019s Office lawyers, and \nmediators, results in delays in the administration of justice; (v) women and disadvantaged \ngroups have limited knowledge of their rights; (vii)  information on the nature and workings of \nthe justice system is not readily available; and (viii) women living in poverty pose multi-layered \ngender issues for the justice sector (e.g., women indigenous persons, women in the informal \nsector, women in agriculture). The gender mainstreaming strategy of the Supreme Court is \ncurrently being revised. While the judiciary and the other justice sector agencies have a gender \nand development plan, implementation and monitoring capacities remain inadequate.  \n \n55.  Jail Decongestion. Access to justice by detained prisoners is currently a major problem \nin the Philippines. Over 95% of persons in BJMP-managed jails are detainees whose cases are \nstill being tried and have not yet been sentenced. It is common for detainees to serve additional \ntime awaiting their trial date in court because their case was not promptly processed following \narrest. An inmate record system has been set up in pilot jails managed by BJMP to more \neffectively monitor the inflow and outflow of detainees awaiting trial. The judiciary is deploying \nthree buses to jails and detention centers, as part of a Justice on Wheels program, to expedite \nthe  release  of  detainees  when  warranted.  The  Bureau  of  Corrections  (BuCor),  which \nadministers  prisons  for  convicts  with  sentences  of  3  years  and  longer,  has  launched  a \nreengineering program that aims to make its operations, including processing the release of \nprisoners when warranted, more efficient. Because the correctional and rehabilitation facilities in \nthe  Philippines  are  administered  by  several  agencies  (Appendix  4:  Sector  Analysis),  jail \ndecongestion  is  a  complex  process  that  entails  multi-agency  actions,  coordination,  and \nexchange of information\u2014all of which require careful assessment and strategic planning. \n                                                 \n35  Code of Professional Responsibility Canon 2, rule 2.01 and Canon 14.  \n36 Outstanding examples of access to justice programs include the European Union-supported Supreme Court \nprogram on \u201cAccess to Justice by the Poor through Information, Education and Communication,\u201d and the Barangay \nJustice Services System and Barangay Justice Advocates training program supported by USAID. Another is the \nWorld Bank\u2019s mobile courts program, Justice on Wheels, where three court buses have been acquired and \ndeployed to strategic areas to serve as venues for court annexed mediation and hearings of detainees, particularly \nchildren in conflict with the law. \n ", "  21\n \n \n5.  Delivery of Justice through Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms \n56.   Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, particularly recourse to the barangay justice \nsystem and mediation, have increased access to justice. Evidence suggests that settlements \narrived at through these mechanisms have reduced the volume of complaints flowing into the \ncourt system.  \n \n57.  Barangay Justice System. USAID is supporting the Barangay Justice Service System \n(BJSS) in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The BJSS involves training \nand mobilization of barangay justice advocates, who are citizen-volunteers  trained in barangay \njustice law; a paralegal course; basic counseling and mediation, alternative dispute resolution, \nand Shari\u2019a (customary Muslim) law. The barangay justice advocates perform the following \nfunctions: (i) facilitate resolution of conflicts in their respective communities, (ii) assist parties to \nlook for options within the rule of law, and (iii) assist in enhancing community awareness and \nencourage appropriate use of the justice system.  \n \n58.  In  2006,  a  USAID-funded  review  of  BJSS  concluded  that  when  compared  with \ncommunities that do not participate in the program, BJSS barangays (i) had a significantly \nhigher  number  of  disputes  resolved;  (ii)  awareness  of  the  barangay  justice  system  was \nsignificantly higher; (iii) awareness of individual rights and responsibilities in the justice system \nwas significantly higher; (iv) the role of women in settling disputes, the number of women trained \nto settle disputes, and the number of disputes settled by women were higher; and (v) community \ncooperative activities were higher. Barangays under the BJSS also had significantly higher \nlevels of participation in civic organizations, relative to barangays who are not covered by the \nBJSS program.   \n \n59.  Court-Annexed  Mediation.  Court-annexed  mediation,  which  the  Supreme  Court \ninstituted in 2001, is a system of referring certain cases to mediators.37 There is evidence that \ncourt-annexed  mediation  can  assist  in  de-congesting  court  dockets.  The  Supreme  Court \nestablished  the  Philippine  Mediation  Center  within  its  training  arm,  the  Philippine  Judicial \nAcademy,  to  set  up  mediation  centers  in  court  houses  and  other  convenient  locations \nthroughout the country and to run the mediation system. Currently, there are 113 units in 11 of \nthe country\u2019s 13 judicial regions. More than 75% of all cases that underwent mediation during \nthe pilot court-annexed mediation project were settled. To date, more than 500 mediators have \nbeen trained, 300 of whom are currently accredited by the Supreme Court.   \n \n60.  In spite of these successes, there is a need to encourage stakeholders to make full use \nof these alternative mechanisms. As an example of a high success rate for settling cases, the \nuse of court-annexed mediation has not been maximized, as only a small percentage of eligible \ncases are being submitted to mediation. Judges have reportedly been reluctant to refer cases \nwithin  the scope  of  court-annexed  mediation.  With  the passage  of  the  Alternative  Dispute \nResolution  Act,  Congress  has  recognized  the  important  role  that  arbitration,  mediation, \nconciliation, and other similar private mechanisms can play in resolving disputes. However, the \nlaw has not yet been implemented, as Congress has yet to approve the draft implementing rules \nprepared by DOJ. Notwithstanding the fact that private dispute resolution is regularly provided \nfor  in  international  commercial  business  contracts,  there  appears  to  be  low  demand  for \narbitration and similar mechanisms in the Philippines. Local lawyers and representatives of \nforeign investment groups have suggested that the public is uncertain about how arbitration \n                                                 \n37  Supreme Court Administrative Matter No. 01-10-5-Supreme Court PHILJA, 16 October 2001. \n ", "22   \nproceedings and awards would be treated by the courts. They have also expressed doubts \nregarding the Government\u2019s capacity to enforce arbitration awards.  \n \nD.  Lesson  \n61.  Separation of Powers and Judicial Independence. A key lesson from the Access to \nJustice Program in Pakistan, ADB\u2019s first justice sector reform program,38 is that one cannot \ndivorce the issue of separation of powers, or judicial independence, from a justice sector reform \nprogram,  even  when  it  is  focused  on  technical  and  management  reforms.  This  lesson  is \nparticularly critical in the Philippines, which has a strong legal tradition recognizing judicial \nindependence and where justice sector agencies deal with each other in a cautious fashion. \nJustice sector reform requires engagement with several justice sector reform champions. Even \nin Pakistan where the Access to Justice Program was developed in an environment where \npolitical consensus was facilitated by a strong executive, a key lesson learned was that the \nMinistry of Law and Justice, as the executing agency, could not realistically be assumed to take \non a leadership role for an entire justice sector that comprised a number of diverse agencies. In \nthis  instance,  the  executing  agency  that  was  responsible  for  program  leadership  and \nimplementation had limited formal relations with the judiciary, which was a major implementing \nagency. There were issues related to the speed in which project funds allotted to the judiciary \nwere  being  disbursed.  In  addition,  the  Ministry  of  Law  and  Justice  did  not  have  direct \nsupervision of the police, which came under the Ministry of Interior\u2019s control. As a result, the \npolice reform component of the Access to Justice Program in Pakistan enjoyed limited success \nwhen compared to that enjoyed by the judicial reform efforts.  \n \n62.  To support several justice sector reform champions and build support for justice sector-\nwide reform in the context of the principle of separation of powers inherent in the justice sector, \nstrong and sustained policy dialogue is required. The importance of policy dialogue in sustaining \njustice sector reform was an important lesson in the example of Pakistan. The policy dialogue \nmust be supported by research and baseline studies, and informed by the participation of civil \nsociety. In the Philippines, it appears it would be useful to achieve consensus by focusing on \nissues that all justice sector agencies deem as important and develop a process of dialogue, \nwhich is equally important to the consensus that results. Once dialogue among justice sector \nchampions  has  been  established,  it  should  be  widened  to  include  other  justice  sector \nstakeholders and civil society.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objective and Scope \n63.  The GJSRP aims to support the justice sector in the Republic of the Philippines by (i) \nincreasing resources available to the justice sector to levels that would reasonably enable the \nefficient delivery of justice services, (ii) supporting government efforts to strengthen the rule of \nlaw in the Philippines by enhancing the efficiency and integrity of justice sector agencies, (iii) \nimproving access to justice by the poor and vulnerable groups with a specific focus on gender-\nbased discriminatory practices and gaps, and (iv) improving investor confidence and public trust \nin justice sector agencies. The proposed GJSRP consists of two subprograms. Subprogram 1 \nwill focus on increasing resources to the justice sector and supporting the efficient delivery of \n                                                 \n38 The GJSRP is ADB\u2019s second justice sector reform program. The first, Access to Justice Program in Pakistan, \nwhich addressed reforms relating to judicial processes and institutions, police and public safety, prosecution, \nadministrative justice and alternative dispute resolution, was approved on 20 December 2001 as a $350 million \nprogram loan (including a $20 million TA loan and a $1.3 million TA). \n ", "  23\njustice  service.  Subprogram  2  will  focus  on  institutional capacity  building  to  deliver  justice \nservices to communities and implement measures to address key justice sector priorities. \n \n64.  The GJSRP includes a series of policy reforms and capacity-building activities that \nunderpin the priorities of the MTPDP and related sector strategies. These reforms are designed \nto accomplish the following:  \n(i)  Strengthen  judicial  fiscal  autonomy,  and  improve  justice  sector \naccountability  and  access  to  resources  by  enhancing  public  financial \nmanagement systems, supporting decentralization of financial management and \nadministrative capabilities, and making remuneration in the justice sector more \ncompetitive: \n(ii)  Enhance justice sector integrity through the development and  enforcement of \ncodes of conduct and the participation of civil society in monitoring justice sector \nperformance  and  integrity;  conduct  of  an  integrity  development  review; \ntransparency in the judicial selection and appointment process; and the wide and \ntimely dissemination of judicial decisions: \n(iii)  Improve justice sector efficiency through the development of efficient case flow \nmanagement;  streamlined  investigation,  prosecution,  and  court  processes; \nsustainable capacity-building programs for justice sector staff, and the promotion of \na sector-wide approach to justice reform: \n(iv)  Improve access to justice by the poor and vulnerable groups through the \ndesignation  of  selected  courts  to  expeditiously  handle  small  claims;  capacity \nbuilding of selected justice sector agencies to support gender and development-\nrelated reforms and activities; and a comprehensive multisectoral jail decongestion \nstrategy:  \n(v)   Expand delivery of justice through supporting the implementation of efficient and \neffective alternative dispute resolution mechanisms nationwide. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions under Subprogram 1 \n65.  All policy measures required for the first tranche of subprogram 1 were completed by the \nend of July 2008.  \n \n1.  Strengthened Judicial Fiscal Autonomy, and Improved Justice Sector \nAccountability and Access to Resources \n66.  Justice  Sector  Administration  and  Results-Based  Management.  Justice  sector \nagencies under the executive branch have adopted the OPIF, and the Supreme Court has also \nsignified its commitment. The leadership of the judiciary issued a statement early in 2008 on the \njudiciary\u2019s commitment to use OPIF in budget preparation, fiscal management, and planning.39 \nTo demonstrate the judiciary\u2019s commitment to the OPIF, the pilot court administration office in \nRegion 7 has prepared its proposed 2009 budget following the OPIF template and principles. \nThe judiciary\u2019s adoption of the OPIF strengthens its capacity to plan and manage its own \nresources, and  improve  its  capability  to  exercise  fiscal autonomy.  However,  the  judiciary\u2019s \nadoption of the OPIF in practice will require significant strengthening of the judiciary\u2019s financial \nmanagement  systems  and  a  change  management  process.  Under  subprogram  1,  second \ntranche, it is expected that the field offices of justice sector agencies will be able to implement \nthe OPIF for budget preparation and performance monitoring by August 2009, and the Supreme \nCourt is expected to submit an OPIF-compliant budget for 2010. \n \n                                                 \n39 In 2007, the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA), Sandiganbayan, and CA began work on their OPIF-compliant budgets, \nwhich includes the submission of a logical framework in their budget submissions.  \n ", "24   \n \n \n67.  Apart from adoption of the OPIF, other financial management reforms that increase \njustice sector agencies\u2019 accountability in the use of public funds that have been completed by \nJuly 2008 include: the judiciary\u2019s preparation and adoption of the MTEP 2008\u20132010 and a new \ngovernment accounting system, and the formation of bids and awards committees in justice \nsector agencies. Under subprogram 1, second tranche, it is expected that the judiciary will have \nprepared and adopted a rolling MTEP for 2009\u20132011 that will reflect information on the use of \nthe Judicial Autonomy Fund established in connection with the pilot regional court administration \noffice.  \n \n68.  Decentralization of Financial Management and Administrative Functions of the \nJudiciary. To further strengthen its capacity to exercise fiscal autonomy, the Supreme Court en \nbanc  approved  an  assessment  report  on  existing  financial  management  practices  in  the \njudiciary.  The  report  recommended  financial  management  reforms  and  a  decentralized \nadministrative structure to correct deficiencies. Thereafter, the Supreme Court approved the \nrecommended reforms under a decentralized administrative structure. As discussed above, a \npilot regional court administration office was established in Region 7 (RCAO 7) to address \neasily-identifiable  redundancies  and  inefficiencies.  New  management  tools  are  being \nimplemented in RCAO 7, including gradual implementation of the OPIF. Other reforms in RCAO \n7 include budget submissions that fully reflect and account for the use of fines and duties \ncollected by the courts, LGU contributions, and funds reallocated from unfilled positions in the \njudiciary\u2019s budget. Guidelines promoting transparency in the use of all resources available to the \ncourts, including contributions from LGUs, have been issued by the RCAO 7 administrator, \nunder authority of the Supreme Court. RCAO 7 will support enhanced financial systems that \nwill track all receipts and expenditures irrespective of their origin. Under subprogram 2, it is \nexpected that RCAO 7 will be replicated in at least two additional regions of the Philippines. \n \n69.  Increased  and  Improved  Access  to  Resources.  The  continued  and  successful \nimplementation of these reforms in the judiciary and in other justice sector agencies depends on \nincreased  allocations  of  budgetary  resources.  As  of  July  2008,  the  Government  had \ndemonstrated an increased budgetary commitment through the following measures: (i) the \nNational Expenditure Program for 2009 reflects an increase in the judiciary\u2019s budget of at least \n18.8%, and (ii) DOJ has increased the levels of capital outlay in 2008 by 140% from 2006 \nlevels. In addition, the National Expenditure Program for 2009 reflects proposed allotments to \npartially  fund  two  new  laws  strengthening  the  Office  of  the  Solicitor  General  and  Public \nAttorney\u2019s Office. A key requirement for release of the second tranche is that the National \nExpenditure  Program  for  2010  reflects  a  proposal  to  fully  fund  these  two  new  laws. \nDemonstrating its commitment to implement improved financial management capability, the \nSupreme Court has submitted an OPIF-compliant proposed budget to support implementation \nof the pilot RCAO 7 beginning in 2009.40  \n \n70.  Under Subprogram 1, second tranche, the National Expenditure Program for 2010 will \npropose to provide the judiciary with a national Government-sourced budget that is equivalent to \nat least 1% of the Government\u2019s total expenditure. In addition, under subprogram 1, second \ntranche, DBM will start the release of scheduled allocations to the judiciary in line with the \napproved budget and agreed-upon operational cash program of the Supreme Court, in full each \nquarter and without conditions.  \n \n71.  Likewise under subprogam, 1 second tranche, the National Expenditure Program for \n2010 will propose that other justice sector agencies compliant with the OPIF will be provided \n                                                 \n40 The pilot RCAO 7 operations, which started in July 2008, are funded by savings in the 2008 budget of the judiciary. \n ", "  25\nreal increases in budgetary resources, taking into consideration inflation and their approved \nMTEPs, and based on performance, absorptive capacity, and the prevailing macroeconomic \nsituation of the country. \n \n72.  Making Remuneration in the Justice Sector More Competitive. Unless justice sector \nsalaries  and  facilities are  gradually  brought  closer  to  competitive  levels,  the  incentives  for \ncorruption will slow progress in implementing other aspects of the GJSRP, such as enhancing \nintegrity. While salary comparisons are different, the salaries of lawyers in public service are \nindicative of the disparity between public and private rates. Entry level salaries of lawyers in \njustice sector agencies are about one-fifth of market levels in the private sector.41  New law \nschool graduates can often obtain starting salaries in the private sector above those provided to \njudges. As regards members of the judiciary, the first major step has already been taken. A \n100% increase in judicial compensation was phased in over a 4-year period (2003\u20132006). The \nincrease was implemented by providing judicial allowances equal to base level salaries. A \nfurther program along this line needs to be developed by other justice sector agencies in \ncooperation with DBM to help finance further effective salary increases. Such a program is to be \nagreed upon with DBM as a key trigger under subprogram 2.  \n \n73.  The doubling of judicial compensation over the 2003\u20132006 period through the provision \nof allowances has already shown positive results. In particular, a correlation has been noted \nbetween the decreasing number of judicial vacancies and increasing court efficiency levels. \nWhile these improvements are meaningful, judicial salaries remain far below competitive levels. \nAs such, an equivalent program to further raise judicial salaries funded from the national budget \n(as distinguished from raising judicial compensation, where additional compensation is sourced \nfrom court fees) is envisaged to be reflected in a phased salary adjustment plan indicated as a \ntrigger under subprogram 2. \n \n74.  The issue of understaffing is even more severe in justice sector agencies under the \nexecutive branch. Even as extra allowances have been legislated to address high vacancy rates \nin NPS and the Office of the Solicitor General and Public Attorney\u2019s Office, authorized funding \nfor allowances at the NPS and Office of the Solicitor General comes from the agencies\u2019 own \nsource revenues, and Public Attorney\u2019s Office allowances remain unfunded. Under Subprogram \n1, second tranche, DBM will include a special provision in the National Expenditure Program for \n2010 to fund the benefits and allowances provided by law to the Public Attorney\u2019s Office and \nOffice of the Solicitor General, where vacancies have been a major problem in the past. As the \njustice sector is hamstrung by these vacancies and the low quality of existing staff, there is \npressing need to raise justice sector salaries closer to market levels under subprogram 2. \n \n2.  Enhanced Justice Sector Integrity \n75.  The Program will support implementation of recommendations under the review and \nenhancement of performance and integrity program for the judiciary, and the conduct of integrity \ndevelopment reviews for the other justice sector agencies. It will support the completion of \ncodes  of  conduct  in  the  justice  sector  agencies,  where  none  currently  exist,  and  the \nestablishment of systems to monitor and enforce compliance, and sanction violations. \n \n                                                 \n41 For example, for new legal graduates the base salary in the NPS is P12,548 per month. In certain circumstances, it \nis possible to almost double this base pay with allowances if the funding for such allowances is available (such \nallowances are generally only partially funded and are  not available at other justice sector agencies such as the \nPublic Attorney\u2019s Office and Office of the Ombudsman). By comparison, market related salaries for new graduates, \nas benchmarked at Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, are P31,952 per month and including benefits, about P56,000 per \nmonth, which is almost 4.5 times the base salaries at the NPS. At business process outsourcing centers, new law \ngraduates command starting salaries of P80,000 per month or almost 6.4 times the base salary at the NPS.   \n ", "26   \n76.  Civic Participation to Enhance Enforcement and Performance Management. This \nprogram supports the Government\u2019s initiatives to garner strong civic participation in order to \nintroduce greater accountability of judges and other justice sector agencies\u2019 personnel to the \npublic. The Judicial and Bar Council (JBC) that nominates candidates for judicial appointments \nhas undergone a major transformation to ensure the appointment of well-qualified judges. Clear \nand  objective  criteria  (e.g.,  measures  of  integrity,  probity,  and  independence)  are  now \nannounced for short-listed candidates and the ratings of all nominees are provided to the public \non the JBC\u2019s website to ensure full transparency. The JBC has opened interviews of judicial \nnominees of certain courts to the public, including civil society organizations such as Supreme \nCourt Appointment Watch. \n \n77.  Transparency  in  Judicial  Decisions.  Steps  have  been  taken  to  increase  the \ntransparency of judicial decisions, initially by ensuring that all Supreme Court decisions are \navailable on their website within 48 hours of promulgation. The Appellate Courts will follow suit \nunder subprogram 2, while RCAO 7 will implement this reform as soon as it is fully operational.  \n \n3.  Supporting Efficiency in the Justice Sector  \n78.  Case Flow Management. Major steps have been taken to develop case tracking and \ncaseflow management systems to ensure the timely administration of justice. Automated case \nmanagement information systems have been installed in the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, \nCourt of Tax Appeals, and the Sandiganbayan. A caseflow management system has been \nestablished at the Office of Court Administrator, and the system has been piloted to track and \nmanage the caseloads of lower courts in Pasay City. As a result of the pilot experience, the \nsystem has been enhanced by the experience and best practices of judges around the country. \nThese measures, together with the decrease in judicial vacancies, have resulted in a higher \ncase disposition rate.  \n \n79.  To speed up the processing of probable cause (preliminary investigation) cases that \nprecede the filing of a criminal complaint with the court, the NPS has reviewed the flow of such \ncases in the prosecution service, streamlined business processes relating to such cases, and \ncompleted an administrative manual and revised prosecutors\u2019 operations manual reflecting the \nstreamlined processes. These processes are the basis for the development of an automated \nprosecutors\u2019  case  management  information  system,  which  is  expected  to  speed  the \nprosecutors\u2019 disposition of probable cause cases. With respect to criminal tax evasion cases, a \nparallel program has been initiated to adopt consistent guidelines on evidentiary requirements in \nconnection with tax evasion cases to be filed by BIR with DOJ. These common guidelines aim \nto ensure that the cases filed by BIR are soundly developed and successfully prosecuted. An \ninternal management unit has been established in the NPS to implement and monitor these \nreform priorities at DOJ. \n \n80.  Strengthening  Investigation,  Prosecution,  and  Adjudication  Functions  in  the \nJustice Sector. To strengthen investigation and prosecution capabilities in the NPS, the DOJ is \ntaking the lead in developing badly-needed training programs and operational manuals for the \ngrossly-understaffed  NPS  office.  Understaffing  arises  from  salaries  that  are  about  20%  of \nmarket rates and generally appeal only to a segment of the inexperienced new law graduates \nfor a limited period of time. Prosecution effectiveness can only be achieved as salaries are \nmoved closer to competitive levels and additional training and guidance are provided. Similarly, \nthe Office of the Solicitor General has developed a comprehensive training strategy for its \nsolicitors. Other notable capacity-building reforms in the justice sector that were accomplished \nby July 2008 include the judiciary\u2019s development of a distance learning program for judges and \nof a human resource development program for nonjudicial employees. \n ", "  27\n \n81.  Streamlining Court Processes and Creation of New Courts. To promote efficiency \nthrough amended rules, the Supreme Court has amended the rules of court to clarify when a \npetition of certiorari may be entertained,42 which would allow for the case to be brought directly \nto the Supreme Court. The amended rules seek to address past misuse and over-use of such \npetitions.  The  Sandiganbayan  has  implemented  continuous  trials  on  a  pilot  basis. \nComplementary to efforts to streamline court processes to improve efficiency, legislation was \npassed establishing a third division in the Court of Tax Appeals that is expected to hear an \nincreased number of criminal tax evasion cases, given the Government\u2019s focus on such cases; \nand the Court of Tax Appeals\u2019 jurisdiction was expanded to hear criminal tax evasion cases \ninvolving P1 million and above.  \n \n82.  Supporting  Justice  Sector  Coordination.  To  achieve  maximum  efficiency  in  the \ndelivery of justice, justice sector agencies need to coordinate reform efforts. A first step in this \ndirection was the signing of a memorandum of agreement for the creation of the Judiciary \nExecutive and Legislative Advisory and Consultative Council. Although the council is mainly \nintended to discuss issues relating to the budget of the judiciary, it signifies that all three \nbranches of government recognize the need for dialogue on issues of common interest relating \nto  justice  sector  performance.  Under  subprogram  1,  second  tranche,  a  justice  sector \ncoordination council will be formed to act as a forum for dialogue and preparation of a justice \nsector  reform  program  comprising  the  Supreme  Court,  National  Economic  Development \nAuthority (NEDA), Office of the Solicitor General, Office of the Ombudsman, DBM, DILG, DOF, \nand DOJ.  \n \n4.  Access to Justice by the Poor and Vulnerable Groups \n83.  In June 2008, the Supreme Court simultaneously held several nationwide summits on \nincreasing access to justice by the poor. The summit\u2019s objective was to hear directly from \nvarious  stakeholders  in  the  justice  system  about  their  concerns  over  access  to  justice, \nparticularly through the judicial system, and recommendations on how the Supreme Court could \naddress these concerns. The feedback from the summits\u2019 has enabled the Supreme Court to \nbetter protect and enforce constitutional rights and ensure that legal assistance is provided to \nthe underprivileged.  \n \n84.  The  judiciary  has  also  increased  access  to  justice  through  the  development  of  a \nframework  for  expediting  the  litigation  of  small  claims.  The  judiciary  has  adopted  rules  of \nprocedure to provide a framework for the expedited handling of small claims, and 22 pilot courts \nhave  been  designated to  handle  small  claims.  The  newly-adopted  procedures  use  judicial \ndispute resolution, which was piloted during the APJR, to speed up the litigation of small claims. \nThe judiciary has also deployed three Justice on Wheels mobile courts to detention centers and \nareas without courts or judges to hear cases in these areas.  \n \n85.  Gender Responsiveness. To increase responsiveness to the needs of women, the \njudiciary, DOJ, and PNP have each adopted a gender action plan and will actively monitor and \nevaluate  its  implementation.  In  particular,  PNP  is  further  expanding  the  establishment  of \nwomen\u2019s and children\u2019s desks in all police stations with the mandate to administer and handle \ncases involving women and children victims of gender-based crimes. \n \n \n                                                 \n42 A petition to the Supreme Court to review the acts of a government agency on the ground that the agency acted \nwithout or in excess of its jurisdiction, or acted in grave abuse of discretion, amounting to a lack or excess of \njurisdiction. \n ", "28   \n \n86.  Jail Decongestion. Jail decongestion is a complex process that requires multi-agency \nactions, coordination, and exchanges of information, given that correctional and rehabilitation \nfacilities in the Philippines are administered by several agencies. It is expected that the problem \nof detainees and overstaying prisoners can be reduced over the medium term through a set of \nfocused actions coordinated among BuCor, BJMP, DOJ, DILG, the Supreme Court, and non-\ngovernment organizations and development partners. The actions will include enhancement of \nBJMP\u2019s pilot inmate record systems and the development of a rollout plan to implement the \nprogram nationwide. Detainees who have stayed beyond the incarceration period that would \nhave been meted had they been convicted of the crime would be set free, thereby decongesting \novercrowded city and municipal jails. With the support of civil society and legal aid groups, such \nactions can be implemented and monitored.  Coordinating these actions with the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s Justice on Wheels program\u2014where mobile court units are fielded to jails and detention \ncenters to set overstaying detainees free\u2014will put in place a comprehensive jail decongestion \nprogram.  \n \n5.  Expanding Delivery of Justice through Alternative Dispute Resolution  \n \n87.  The Supreme Court has adopted a business strategy to rollout court-annexed mediation \nto quickly resolve disputes at reduced costs through mediation to reduce pressure on the courts. \nCourt-annexed mediation will be fully introduced nationwide under subprogram 2. Mechanisms \nstrengthening the barangay justice system, which has demonstrated evidence of effectively \nresolving conflicts outside of the court system at the community level, will be introduced during \nGJSRP implementation.  \n \n88.  The GJSRP will also support strategies to improve the enforcement of international \narbitration awards. A key finding of a process map on the resolution of commercial disputes that \nsurveyed foreign business chambers regarding the use of arbitration was that it is difficult to \nenforce foreign arbitration awards in the Philippines. The perception remains that enforcement \nof an arbitration award can be blocked by further litigation in the courts on the grounds of fraud \nor bad faith as claimed by a disgruntled party. To address the impediments to enforcement and \npromote  efficiency  of  the  dispute  resolution mechanisms  that  are  crucial  for  foreign  direct \ninvestors,  the  Supreme  Court  has  undertaken  a  study  of  the  issues  to  ensure  prompt \nenforcement of foreign arbitration awards.  \n \n89.  While all policy actions for tranche 1 of subprogram 1 have been accomplished, there \nare 8 policy triggers for tranche 2 that the Government and development partners will focus on, \nas follows: \n \nPolicy Triggers for Subprogram 1, Second Tranche \n \n1.  Supreme Court to submit OPIF-compliant budget for 2010 \n2.  Supreme Court to prepare and adopt a rolling MTEP 2009\u20132011 that \nincludes information on the use of the Judiciary Autonomy Fund \n3.  DBM to submit a National Expenditure Program for 2010, which shows \nthat benefits and allowances provided to justice sector agencies (e.g., \nPublic Attorney\u2019s Office and Office of the Solicitor General) under \nexisting laws are fully funded \n4.  National Expenditure Program for the 2010 budget includes a DBM \nproposal to provide (i) the judiciary with a budget sourced from the \nnational Government equivalent to at least 1% of total government \nexpenditure,  and (ii) other justice sector agencies that are compliant \nwith the OPIF real increases in budgetary resources  \n5.  DBM will have fully and unconditionally release the scheduled cash \n ", "  29\nallocations to the judiciary in line with the approved budget and agreed \nupon operational cash program of the Supreme Court. \n6.  Supreme Court en banc to approve replication of RCAO 7 in at least \ntwo selected regions other than Region 7 \n7.  Supreme Court work and financial plan to reflect that the proposed \ncapital expense, MOOE, and related expenses for RCAO 7 in its 2009 \nbudget are allocated to fund the full implementation of additional \nRCAOs in 2009 \n8.  DBM shall submit a National Expenditure Program for 2010 to \nCongress, which shall reflect a line item budget provision for OSG\u2019s \nreorganization and physical expansion, in accordance with existing \nlaw. \n \nDBM  =  Department  of  Budget  and  Management,  MTEP  =  Medium  Term \nExpenditure Program, MOOE = maintenance and other operating expenses, OPIF \n=  organizational  performance  indicator  framework,  OSG  =  Office  of  Solicitor \nGeneral, RCAO 7 = Regional Court Administration Office in Region 7. \n \nC.  Policy Triggers for Subprogram 2 \n90.  The development policy letter sets out the Government\u2019s reform agenda for the next  \n3  years,  building  on  the  reform  momentum  of  subprogram  1.  There  are  8  triggers  for \nsubprogram 2 described in Appendix 2. The milestones that will be monitored for subprogram 2 \nare also described in Appendix 2.   \n \n91.  Impact and Outcome of the Program Cluster. The proposed GJSRP will support the \nGovernment in its efforts to enhance the rule of law in the Philippines. GJSRP implementation \nwill result in improved governance and efficiency of justice sector agencies while expanding \naccess to justice by (i) strengthening judicial fiscal autonomy, justice sector accountability, and \nimproving access of justice sector agencies to resources; (ii) enhancing the integrity of justice \nsector personnel; (iii) supporting the governance and efficiency of justice sector agencies; (iv) \nexpanding  access  to  justice  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  groups,  with  specific  focus  on \naddressing gender-based discriminatory practices and gender gaps; and (v) expanding the \ndelivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution. The Program is expected to result in a \nmore rapid and efficient processing of cases, while the timeliness and accessibility of court \ndecisions will be enhanced. Reflecting better access of the poor and vulnerable groups to the \njustice system, there will be an expected decline in the time legal aid clients spend in pretrial \ndetention. There will also be increased use of arbitration and court-annexed mediation, more \ncertainty in court decisions, and the increased recognition of international arbitration awards, \nwhich has been a contentious issue for foreign investors.  \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n92.  The Government has requested a loan of $300,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources in support of subprogram 1 of the GJSRP. The loan will be disbursed in two tranches: \n$150,000,000 upon loan effectiveness and $150,000,000 when the second tranche conditions \nhave been fully complied, which is anticipated by August 2009. The loan will have a 15-year \nterm, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, and a commitment charge of \n0.15% per annum. The Government has made its own independent decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and has confirmed that this choice was not made on the \nbasis of any advice from ADB. \n \n \n ", "30   \n93.  The  Government  envisages  that  a  loan  of  $300,000,000 will  be  needed  to  finance \nsubprogram 2, the loan amount to be confirmed at the time of loan processing in 2010. Prior to \nthe processing of subprogram 2, the Government will have demonstrated satisfactory progress \nwith  program  implementation  of  subprogram  2  policy  triggers.  The  proposed  triggers  for \nSubprogram 2 are as set out in the policy matrix in Appendix 2. \n \n94.  The program loan reflects the development financing needs of the Government (Table \n6). The Government aims to increase development and social spending in 2008 and, given the \nneed for additional funding to mitigate the effects on the poor of the slowdown in the US \neconomy and the surge in rice prices, the Government envisages a targeted Government deficit \nof no more than 1% of GDP in 2008, 0.5% of GDP in 2009, and a balanced budget in 2010. \nGross and net financing needs are larger than the planned government budget deficit, because \nof the amortization of external and domestic debt. Finally, there are substantial budgetary costs \nto the Government arising from the Program. The release of the second tranche will set the \nstage for a permanent increase in the 2009 budget of about 19% for the judiciary alone, \namounting  to  about  P2.02  billion  (excluding  pension  lump  sum  obligations).43  The  present \ndiscounted value of the increase in the Judiciary\u2019s budget, which is in perpetuity, is estimated to \nbe several times the ADB financing. Other direct costs of the Program include implementing \nsystems to reduce caseload backlog in the court system and congestion in jails, and a program \nof the Supreme Court to increase access to justice for the poor. \n \nTriggers for Subprogram 2 \n \n1.  SC to implement OPIF judiciary-wide  \n2.    The  judiciary  to  prepare  and  submit  to  en  banc  for  its  consideration  and  approval  the \nrationalization program including a phased salary adjustment plan in accordance with the proposed \nSalary Standardization Law III. \n3.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n95.  Program Management.  The Supreme Court and DOF will be the executing agencies. \nThe Supreme Court will be responsible for program activities focused upon judicial reforms and \nthe DOF will be responsible for other program activities. Given the independence of the judiciary \nfrom  the  executive  branch  of  government  under  the  Philippine  Constitution,  it  is  deemed \nnecessary to establish two executing agencies so that the responsibility for attaining outcomes \nspecific to one of the two branches of government is accounted for separately.  \n \n96.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  DOJ,  DILG,  DBM  and  OSG.  Each  of  the \nimplementing agencies will be responsible for meeting the policy actions or program activities \nunder their respective agencies. The Supreme Court and DOF will jointly set up a program \ncoordination  committee  comprising  representatives  from  DBM,  DOJ,  DILG  and  OSG.  The \nprogram coordination committee will be co-chaired by the Head of the International Finance \nGroup of DOF and the SC\u2019s Court Administrator, and will be responsible for implementing and \nsustaining program components. The committee will meet quarterly to coordinate and ensure \neffective implementation of the proposed reforms. ADB may be invited to participate in the \nmeetings  as  an  observer.  The  Supreme  Court  and  DOF  will  be  responsible  for  program \nimplementation activities within their respective scope, report implementation progress, and \nprovide guidance and direction to the implementing agencies. \n \n97.  Implementation Period. The first tranche of subprogram 1 covered the period from \nJanuary 2006 to July 2008. All actions included in the policy matrix under the first tranche have \nbeen implemented within this period. The second tranche of subprogram 1 covers the period \nfrom July 2008 to August 2009. Subprogram 2 extends from September 2009 through August \n2010. The Government and ADB will prepare a program completion report by June 2011. \n \n98.  Procurement and Disbursement. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange cost (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items,44 and imports financed by other bilateral and \nmultilateral sources. In accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s Simplification of Disbursement \nProcedures  and  Related  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,45  no  supporting  import \ndocumentation will be required if during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be \ndisbursed the value of the Philippines\u2019 total imports minus imports from nonmember countries, \nineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development assistance is equal to \nor  greater  than  the  amount  of  the  loan  expected  to  be  disbursed  during  such  year.  The \nGovernment  will  certify  its  compliance  with  this  formula  with  each  withdrawal  request. \nOtherwise, import documentation under existing procedures will be required. ADB reserves the \nright  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s \ncertification.  \n \n99.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and the Policy \non Combating Money Laundering (2003) were explained to the Government. All relevant  \nADB guidelines, including the Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time), \nGuidelines  on  Use  of  Consultants  (2006,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  the  Loan \nRegulations, were specifically brought to the attention and notice of the Government. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require the \n                                                 \n44  For a list of ineligible items, see Appendix 8. \n45  ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n ", "32   \nGovernment to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures and controls following \ninternational best practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption, money laundering \nactivities, or the financing of terrorism; and covenants with ADB that prohibit engaging in such \nactivities.  \n \n100.  As regards to the specific governance and anticorruption measures, the GJSRP\u2019s design \nis to addresses governance and anticorruption issues by strengthening integrity mechanisms in \nthe judiciary and justice sector agencies in the executive branch of government. \n \n101.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds  and  to  verify  the  accuracy  of  the  Government\u2019s  certification  for  the  withdrawal \napplications. Prior to withdrawal, the Government will open a deposit account with the Bangko \nSentral ng Pilipinas (Philippine Central Bank) to receive the loan proceeds. The account will be \nmanaged, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms satisfactory to ADB. DOF will be \nrequired  to  submit  semiannual  progress  reports  and  a  final  report  on  the  progress  of \nsubprogram 1 implementation.  \n \n102.  Counterpart Funds. Counterpart funds generated by the GJSRP will be used by the \nGovernment under the arrangements satisfactory to ADB to support sector reform and meet the \nadjustment  costs  associated  with  the  GJSRP,  as  agreed  upon  by  the  Government.  The \ncounterpart funds generated from the loan proceeds will be transferred from the Treasury to \nDOF and the Supreme Court to meet the costs and counterpart funding requirements for \nimplementing sector reform. \n \n103.  Monitoring and Review. In coordination with the committee (para. 81), ADB will carry \nout periodic reviews of progress implementation and assess the impact of the GJSRP. The \nGovernment will keep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral \nand bilateral agencies that have implications for GJSRP implementation and will provide ADB \nwith the opportunity to comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with \nthe  committee,  will  undertake  a  review  of  program  performance  12  months  after  loan \neffectiveness to review the outcomes of subprogram 1.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n104.  The  TA  will  focus  on  strengthening  capacity  to  deliver  targets  envisioned  under \nsubprogram 2. The total cost of the proposed TA will be in the amount of $2,200,000, of which \nADB will finance $1,500,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program \nand  $500,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  ADB-administered  Gender  and  Development \nCooperation Fund. The Government will provide the additional $200,000 in-kind, in the form of \nadministrative and support costs, including salaries of counterpart staff, secretarial support, \nsupplies, office accommodation, local transportation, miscellaneous costs for training courses, \nand per diem associated with attendance at appropriate events not covered under this TA. The \nSupreme Court and DOF will be the joint executing agencies. DOJ, DBM, and DILG will be the \nimplementing agencies for the TA. The TA components are as follows: \n   \n105.  Strengthening  Judicial  Fiscal  Autonomy,  Justice  Sector  Accountability,  and \nImproved Access to Resources. The TA will assist the justice sector in cascading financial \nmanagement reforms such as the OPIF to field offices. In the judiciary, this subcomponent will \nadapt financial management reforms that are being piloted in the RCAO 7 for rollout in not less \nthan  three  other  selected  regions.  This  is  expected  to  increase  the  judiciary\u2019s  capacity  to \noversee lower courts and provide transparent financial recording and accounting of the Judiciary \nAutonomy Fund, budgets corresponding to unfilled positions, and LGU contributions through the \n ", "  33\nregional court administration offices. It is also expected to increase the lower courts\u2019 capacity to \nplan,  manage,  and  demand  the  resources  required  for  smooth  operations  in  support  of \nproposals to increase the lower courts\u2019 share of maintenance and other operational expenses, \nand the capital outlay budget of the judiciary. It will also support a study to streamline justice \nsector agencies. For the judiciary, this study should include a proposed strategy to shift the \nfunding of allowances, which are equivalent to 100% of judges\u2019 salaries and currently sourced \nmainly by court fees, to the national budget.   \n \n106.  Improving Integrity and Individual Accountability in the Sector. The TA will support \nimplementation  of  recommendations  in  the  review  and  enhancement  of  performance  and \nintegrity (para. 39) concluded in the judiciary, the setting up of an integrity unit at the Supreme \nCourt, and customization of internal controls manuals for justice sector agencies. Reforms that \naim to improve the performance, management, and evaluation of the judiciary will also be \nsupported. The development of codes of conduct and similar documents in agencies that do not \nyet have such codes will be supported. Measures that improve transparency and increase the \nrole  of  civil  society  in  monitoring  justice  sector  performance  and  the  implementation  of \nappointments and disciplinary procedures will also receive support. \n \n107.  Supporting  Efficiency  in  the  Justice  Sector.  The  TA  will  support  the  continuing \ndevelopment of the case management information systems in the judiciary and the NPS, and \nrelated  change  management  programs.  The  establishment  of  a  forum  (the  Justice  Sector \nCoordination Council) to discuss and coordinate justice sector reforms will be supported. As the \nGJSRP\u2019s  performance  depends  on  the  Government\u2019s  actions,  the  TA  will  support  the \ndevelopment and implementation of a monitoring and evaluation system for the Program.  \n \n108.  Access to Justice by the Poor and Vulnerable Groups. The fourth area of support \nconcerns the implementation of the judiciary\u2019s program to increase access to justice by the \npoor, including the implementation of a comprehensive jail decongestion program through the \nrollout of a simplified inmate record system. The TA will support civil society participation in \npolicy  dialogue  and  reform  implementation.  Under  this component,  the  TA  will  pursue  the \nobjective  of  gender-based  development  in  the  justice  sector  by  building  the  gender-based \ncapacities of selected justice sector agencies. This output will strengthen the PNP\u2019s women and \nchildren\u2019s desk officers program and pilot test a stress management program for these officers. \nIn the NPS, the TA will support gender-sensitivity trainings and related benchmarking activities \nto  track  performance.  In  the  judiciary,  the  TA  will  develop  benchmark  indicators  and \nperformance standards for family courts, develop related amendments to the rules of court and \nadministrative  procedures  on  gender-based  violence,  and  support  training  on  the  gender-\nsensitive handling of cases in family courts. The activities will be implemented in municipalities \nand  cities  within  selected  provinces.  These  efforts  will  be  piloted\u2014under  the  Gender  and \nDevelopment Cooperation Fund\u2014in Region 7, which includes the provinces of Cebu, Bohol, \nNegros  Oriental,  and  Siquijor.  Based  on  the  implementation  of  pilot-tested  activities,  the \nGovernment is expected to extend the proposed activities to the national level. \n \n109.  Support for Alternative Dispute Resolution. The fifth area of support relates to the \nuse of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, particularly the barangay justice system. This \nwill include training and support for barangay justice advocates, community mediators, and \nparalegals to enable them to assist community members, particularly members of the poor and \nvulnerable groups, in dealing with disputes. The individual components of the proposed TA are \noutlined in a Supplementary Appendix on Technical Assistance Support for Governance in \nJustice Sector Reform. \n ", "34   \n \nVI.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n110.  Benefits.  The  Program\u2019s  principal  benefits  are  improved  incentives,  increased \nresources, and greater accountability all leading to a higher quality of public services in the \njustice sector. Primary beneficiaries will be justice sector agencies and staff, who will benefit \nfrom a better-resourced justice sector. While most benefits are expected to emerge over the \nlong term, in the short to medium term, competitive salaries and higher budgets will reduce \nvacancies among judges and prosecutors, improve information and case management systems, \nand provide the basis for a progressive reduction in delays in the justice system. Consequently, \nthe Program will also benefit users of the justice system, who will enjoy the more efficient and \neffective delivery of justice. Faster court decisions and wider dissemination of information about \nthese decisions will improve understanding among individuals and businesses about the costs \nand  benefits  of  seeking  contract  enforcement  through  the  formal  court  system,  mediation, \narbitration, and/or informal mechanisms of dispute settlement. The Program also has a special \nfocus on the poor and disadvantaged groups, especially women and children. \n \n111.  A key benefit is the deepening of a results-based performance management framework \nby which individuals, agencies, and departments can be held accountable through the OPIF and \nperformance-based budgets.  When fully in place, this framework will draw all justice sector \nagencies  into  the  national  MTEF  exercise  in  which  each  agency  aligns  its  priorities  and \nperformance targets with national targets under the MTPDP for executive agencies, and the \nSupreme Court for the judiciary. Strengthened accountability over the use of public resources \nwithin the justice sector is a major benefit to be achieved through a modern performance \nmanagement framework. Deepening and widening public participation and feedback in the \njustice sector will further strengthen accountability mechanisms and provide a set of incentives \nto improve service delivery across justice sector agencies.  \n \n112.  Social and Environment Safeguards. The GJSRP will not involve any involuntary \nresettlement  nor  have  a  negative  impact  on  indigenous  people  or  the  environment.  It  is \nclassified as category C with respect to involuntary resettlement, and impact on indigenous \npeople  and  the  environment.46  The  GJSRP  is  a  general  intervention  aimed  at  supporting \ngovernance reforms in the justice sector and in that respect it is expected to have an indirect \npositive effect on poverty reduction by improving access to justice by the poor and vulnerable \ngroups,  and  by  creating  a  governance  environment  that  promotes  investment  and  more \nsustainable economic growth (Appendix 7).  \n \n113.  Assumptions and Risks. The GJSRP assumes political stability in the Philippines and \nsustained implementation of sound macroeconomic policies by the Government. Given the \nPhilippines\u2019 encouraging results in establishing a resilient macroeconomic framework since the \nAsian financial crisis, both of these assumptions appear to be valid and defensible. However, \nimplementation of the GJSRP could face a number of risks for which mitigation measures have \nbeen designed: \n(i)  Exogenous shocks. The Philippines economy in 2008 has been affected by \nthree adverse developments in the external environment: (a) the financial sector \nknock-on effects from the US financial crisis, (b) the US and global economic \nslowdown, and (c) commodity and fuel price increases. In recognition of the \nimpact of these exogenous shocks to its fiscal position, the Government has \n                                                 \n46  The GJSRP is classified as Category C since it is unlikely to have environmental impacts; no involuntary \nresettlement effects foreseen, the program neither require a resettlement plan nor a resettlement framework; and \nhave no impact on indigenous people and therefore do not require special provisions for them. \n \n ", "  35\nadjusted its fiscal balance targets from 2008 to 2010. The easing of the fiscal \ntarget  will  provide  more  headroom  for  expenditures,  including  the  needed \nincreases in budgetary resources for justice sector agencies. The Government \nhas remained steadfast in its development program\u2014increased infrastructure \nspending, support for critical sectors (e.g., mining, business process outsourcing, \nand tourism)\u2014in support of economic growth, while also sustaining its revenue \nmobilization efforts. Nevertheless, it is expected that there will be a net economic \nslowdown that will adversely affect the Government\u2019s ability to increase fiscal \nresources allocated to the justice sector.  \n(ii)  Judicial  fiscal  autonomy  and  administrative  independence.  While  the \nConstitution protects fiscal autonomy and the independence of the judiciary, in \npractice budgetary constraints and weaknesses in administration hamper the \nexercise  of  fiscal  autonomy  and  independence.  Rectifying  the  situation  will \nrequire strong commitment to good governance from the judiciary and other \ngovernment  entities,  including  LGUs.  It  will  also  depend  on  the  speed  and \ncommitment  in  which  the  judiciary  and  its  personnel  establish  strong \nadministrative and financial mechanisms that are transparent, participatory, and \nprovide a strong sense of accountability for the use of public resources. Under \nthe attached TA, ADB will continue to support the judiciary in its fiscal and \nadministrative  reforms,  including  support  for  change  management  to  help \nmitigate this risk. \n(iii)  Resistance to governance reforms. There will be resistance to the reforms \nfrom affected personnel, in particular from middle- to high-level staff that have a \nvested  interest  in  the  existing  power  structure  and  illegal  rents.  This  risk \nreinforces the need for change management to be supported by an effective \nadvocacy  program  targeted  at  internal  and  external  shareholders.  For  this \nreason,  a  change  management  and  advocacy  component  is  included  in  the \naccompanying TA. The risk will also be mitigated by continued policy dialogue \nwith the Government and other stakeholders. \n(iv)  Weak absorptive capacity. Weak absorptive capacity of implementing justice \nsector agencies due to inadequate resources (financial and human) will continue \nto undermine the impact of reforms. However, close performance monitoring and \ntargeted  technical  assistance  to  implementing  agencies  will  help  reduce  the \nadverse effects of implementation delays due to capacity constraints.  \n(v)  Slow pace of civil service reforms. The slow pace of civil service reforms that \nlimits the ability of justice sector agencies to rationalize their staff and transform \nthose  savings  into  higher  levels  of  remuneration  for  attracting  and  retaining \nqualified  personnel  undermines  ongoing  initiatives  to  improve  capacity.  To \naddress this risk in the judiciary, the TA includes support for the judiciary to \nprepare a staff rationalization plan for submission to DBM and the Civil Service \nCommission. In addition, change management support is required to give justice \nsector staff time to understand, internalize, and put into practice the reforms. \n(vi)  Governance reversals. There is a risk that current governance reforms may be \nreversed by future governments. This risk may be mitigated by ongoing policy \ndialogue  with  the  Government  as  well  as  other  stakeholders,  including  the \njudiciary, the legislative branch, civil society, and development partners. The \nprogram cluster targets reforms that are in the public interest so that the reversal \nof reforms by future governments may become less likely. Support under the \naccompanying TA to the new Justice Sector Coordination Council will facilitate \npolicy  dialogue,  enhance  related  capacity,  and  help  build  greater  public \nawareness of the ongoing reform agenda.  \n \n ", "36   \nVII.  SPECIFIC ASSURANCES \n114.  In addition to the continued compliance and implementation of the actions specified in \nthe Program\u2019s policy matrix and standard assurances, the Government has given the following \nspecific assurances: \n \n(i)  Policy matrix. The Government will ensure the satisfactory implementation of \nthe Program and will accomplish the actions set out in the policy matrix, in \nparticular,  actions  that  are  conditions  for  the  release  of  Tranche  2.  The \nGovernment will submit documents, in a form satisfactory to ADB, as evidence to \ndemonstrate compliance. The Government will carry out the policies and actions \nin accordance with the schedule of policy reforms contained in the policy matrix \nand ensure that the reforms in the justice sector are sustained. \n (ii)  Policy dialogue.    \n(a)  The Government will keep ADB informed of, and will from time to time \nexchange views on, the progress made in carrying out subprogram 1. In \naddition,  the  Government  will  continue  policy  dialogue  with  ADB  on \nproblems  and  constraints  encountered  during  implementation  of \nsubprogram 1 and on appropriate measures to overcome or mitigate \nsuch problems and constraints. \n(b)   The Government will keep ADB informed of policy discussions with other \nmultilateral  and  bilateral  agencies  that  have  implications  for \nimplementation  of  subprogram  1,  and  will  provide  ADB  with  an \nopportunity  to  comment  on  any  resulting  policy  proposals.  The \nGovernment will take ADB\u2019s views into consideration before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \n(iii)  Counterpart funds.  The Government will ensure that the counterpart funds will \nbe used to finance the local currency costs relating to the implementation of the \nProgram and other activities consistent with the objectives of the Program and \nwill provide necessary budget appropriations to finance the structural adjustment \ncost relating to the implementation of reforms under the Program.  \n (iv)  Subprogram 1 review and evaluation \n(a)  Information.  DOF  and  the  Supreme  Court  will  provide  ADB  with  all \nrelevant data and information in such detail as ADB may reasonably \nrequest to facilitate review by ADB of the progress in the implementation \nof subprogram 1. \n(b)  Reports. DOF and the Supreme Court will prepare the quarterly progress \nreports as well as closing report on subprogram 1.  \n(c)  Subprogram  1  review.  At  the  end  of  subprogram  1,  DOF  and  the \nSupreme Court will ensure that a review is undertaken for subprogram 1. \nThe review will identify the lessons learned, to be used for input in the \ndesign of the proposed subprogram 2 of the Program Cluster. \n(d)  Subprogram 1 review report. A subprogram 1 review report will be \nsubmitted to ADB that (a) assesses compliance with the policy actions \nunder subprogram 1, including tranches 1 and 2; (b) assesses progress \nwith implementation of complementary activities under the overall reform \nprogram; (c) reviews fiscal performance and updated fiscal estimates; \nand  (d)  defines  requirements  for  adjustments  to  activities  under  the \nproposed Subprogram 2. \n ", "  37\n \n115.  The following is the condition for program loan effectiveness:  \n \nThe Government will have established the program coordination committee, which will \nbe co-chaired by DOF and the Supreme Court, and comprise representatives from DOJ, \nDILG, DBM, and the OSG. \n \nVIII.

The Philippines Medium Term Development \nPlan 2004 - 2010 highlights the importance of strengthening the rule of law and the public \nservice  delivery  of  the  Justice  Sector  as  a  basic  need.  It  envisions  a  judiciary  that  is \nindependent, effective and efficient. It also envisions a holistic and integrated reform effort in \nthe justice system. \n \nThe Justice sector is an interlocking set of agencies that includes the judiciary and agencies \nfrom  the  executive  branch,  including  prosecutions,  enforcement,  corrections,  penology  and \ninstitutions for public legal assistance. Improving the public service delivery of justice sector \ninstitutions require a number of interlinked reforms including strengthened incentives to deliver \npublic services, enhanced expenditure and budget management capabilities and accountability \nfor use of resources, more efficient delivery of justice, greater citizen voice and participation \nand access to justice. \n \nGovernment is committed to this program, which focuses on resolving the budgetary restraints \non  the  Judiciary  and  is  reflective  of  the  importance  given  in  the  Philippines  to  improving \ngovernance  of  the  entire  Justice  Sector.  These  efforts  are  intended  to  create  a  just  and \nequitable society through enhancing the rule of law in the Philippines. The economic impacts \nwill follow from greater investor confidence and an improved investment climate, resulting in \nhigher  growth  and  renewed  poverty  reduction.  These  objectives  will  be  achieved  through \nimproved governance and public service delivery by the Justice Sector. \n \nThe  Judiciary  has  been  independently  developing  its  reform  program  since  2000  under \ntechnical  assistance  importantly  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  but  also  from  other \ndevelopment  partners.  The  current  program  shown  in  the  attached  matrix  is  now  being \nimplemented under the Judiciary's prerogative 'as an independent branch of the Government. \n \nThe key outputs of strengthened judicial fiscal autonomy, justice sector accountability, \nand  improved  access  to  resources  are  to  be  achieved  through  application  of  a  series  of \nfinancial management reforms including performance based budgeting. The Judiciary will be \nshowcasing through the pilot Regional Court Administrator's Office (RCAO) in Region 7, the \napplication of performance-based budgeting that is both transparent as well as comprehensive \nin terms of incorporating all sources of revenues and all uses of funds. \n \nSteps have been taken to enhance justice sector integrity by setting higher standards of \nconduct  and  their  enforcement  and  conducting  integrity  development  reviews  of  agencies \n ", "   \n42      Appendix 2 \nwithin the justice sector. To improve access to justice by the poor and vulnerable groups, \nthe  Judiciary  has  supported  an  expanded  Justice  on  Wheels  program,  with  a  focus  on \nassisting in the decongestion of jails; the designation of small claims courts to expedite the \nhandling of small claims, and the implementation of a gender and development action plan. To \nexpand delivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution, the Supreme Court has \nadopted a business strategy to rollout and expand their Court Annexed Mediation to resolve \ndisputes speedily at reduced costs through mediation while reducing the pressure on the \nCourts. \n \nAs regards improvements in justice sector efficiency, major steps have been. taken by \ndeveloping case tracking and case management systems at the Supreme Court, Court of \nAppeals, Sandiganbayan, Court of Tax Appeals and the Office of the Court Administrator, as \nwell as in the National Prosecution Service (NPS), an integral office in Department of Justice \n(DOJ). DOJ has also developed training programs and operational manuals for NPS to improve \nprosecutor capability to handle cases assigned to them. \n \nBudgetary Resource Requirements. The continued implementation of these reforms will be \ndependent on increased levels of real budgetary resources.

Key Agencies \n \n1.  The  Philippine  justice  system,  which  enforces  laws  established  by  the  Legislature, \nconsists of a network of institutions involving the other two branches of Philippine Government, \nnamely  the  judiciary  and  the  executive.  The  judiciary,  the  core  justice  sector  institution \n(discussed extensively in para. 4), interprets laws and determines their application in actual \ndisputes.1 The executive branch is in charge of implementing the existing body of laws and \nplays a variety of roles in justice sector operations. It supervises certain offices that have been \ngranted investigatory, prosecutorial, or dispute resolution powers. It has the prerogative to \nchoose whom to prosecute for criminal violations and the power to apprehend and punish law \nbreakers. It also has the power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons; and remit fines \nand forfeitures after a final judgment of conviction had been issued by a court.2 In addition, laws \nhave granted certain agencies under the executive quasi-judicial powers the authority to resolve \ncertain  disputes  within  these  agencies\u2019  specific  jurisdiction  as  set  forth  by  the  law,  which \ngenerally may be appealed to the judiciary on questions of law (as opposed to questions of \nfact). An overview of justice sector agencies is provided below. \n \n2.  The judiciary, led by the Supreme Court, is an independent branch of government co-\nequal to the executive and legislative branches. The judiciary comprises the Supreme Court, \nCourt of Appeals, Court of Tax Appeals, the Sandiganbayan (a special anticorruption court), and \nlower courts. There are some 2,166 lower courts throughout the country, including 56 Shari\u2019a \ncourts in the Autonomous Regions of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Under the 1987 Constitution, \njudicial power expressly includes not only the settlement of controversies involving legally-\nenforceable rights, but also it is the duty of the courts to review acts of government for possible \ngrave  abuses  of  discretion.  The  Constitution  also  strengthened  judicial  independence.  Its \npowers to appoint, discipline, and remove officials and employees of the judiciary for cause, and \nto adopt its own rules of procedure were recognized. It granted the judiciary fiscal autonomy and \nprohibited the reduction of appropriations for the judiciary below the previous year\u2019s level.3  All \ncourts and court personnel are under the administration and supervision of the Supreme Court. \n(A discussion on judicial independence appears in the section on Sector Issues below.) \n \n3.  In the executive branch, a key justice sector agency is the Department of Justice (DOJ). \nThe Secretary of Justice is tasked with the protection of the Government\u2019s and people\u2019s legal \ninterests. Assisted by the DOJ\u2019s legal staff, the Secretary provides legal advice and a variety of \nlegal  services  to  the  Government,  its  functionaries,  government-owned  and  -controlled \ncorporations and their subsidiaries. An attached, though autonomous, agency is the Office of \n                                                 \n1  Although private individuals may choose to resolve disputes among themselves, and even as dispute resolution \nmay take place in other government branches\u2013for example, certain disputes are resolved by an administrative \nbody exercising quasi-judicial power under the executive branch\u2013the judiciary is the only agency that has the \npower to interpret the law when the law is unclear or susceptible to different interpretations, and protect rights and \nresolve disputes in accordance with their definitive interpretation of the law. Moreover, the judiciary exercises the \npower to review the decisions and actions of any government agency to determine if they have been performed \n\u201cwith grave abuse and discretion\u201d or \u201cwith lack or in excess of jurisdiction.\u201d \n2  See for example art. vii sec. 19 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution, which explicitly gives his power to the    \nPresident, subject to the following limitations: (i) it cannot be exercised in impeachment cases, (ii) it can be \nexercised only after conviction by final judgment, and (iii) the president may grant amnesty (granted to classes of \npersons guilty if political offenses) only with the concurrence of all Members of Congress. \n3  Other measures to protect judicial independence include (i) The Constitution prohibits Legislature from depriving \nthe Supreme Court of jurisdiction vested by the Constitution or reorganizing the judiciary so as to determine the \nsecurity if judicial tenure. (ii) Justices and judges hold office in good behavior until age 70 and their salaries may \nnot be decreased. \n ", "58      Appendix 4     \nthe Solicitor General, which represents the Government in civil cases, and in criminal cases on \nappeal.  Being autonomous, it is not subject to the direction of the Secretary of Justice. \n \n4.  The National Prosecution Service (NPS), which is in charge of making a preliminary \ninvestigation of criminal complaints and the prosecution of alleged offenders, is an integral part \nof DOJ and is subject to the direction of the Secretary of DOJ.  It is headed by a chief state \nprosecutor who is appointed by the president. Its authorized workforce of more than 4,000 \npersonnel is divided almost equally between prosecutors and support personnel. Unfortunately, \nthere are a very large number of vacant positions in the civil service and salaries are too low to \nattract applicants. The prosecution of corruption cases in the Sandiganbayan\u2014that is, those \ncases brought against senior public officials--is managed by the Office of the Ombudsman, \nwhich is an office provided for in the Constitution. The Office of the Ombudsman, through its \nOffice of the Special Prosecutor, has exclusive responsibility for prosecuting corruption cases in \nthe Sandiganbayan. The Office of Ombudsman shares with the NPS the function of prosecuting \nlower  ranking  officials  before  the  regular  courts.  The  office  also  handles  administrative \ncomplaints against public officials. \n \n5.  The principal law enforcement agency is the Philippine National Police (PNP), a force of \nsome 125,000. The National Police Commission provides oversight for the PNP. However, the \nagency also needs to be responsive to local governments that have roles in police recruitment \nand discipline, and provide supplemental resources. Also, the PNP is often called on to carry \nout functions for other law enforcement agencies that have less of a national presence, such as \nthe  Philippine  Drug  Enforcement  Administration.  Administratively,  the  PNP  is  under  the \njurisdiction  of  the  Department  of  the  Interior  and  Local  Government  (DILG).  The  National \nBureau of Investigation (NBI) is the premier investigative law enforcement body, with about \n1,700 plainclothes investigators and related staff. The NBI is attached to DOJ. About 30 other \nnational  agencies  exercise  some  law  enforcement  function.  Coordination  among  law \nenforcement  agencies  is  carried  out  through  the  National  Law  Enforcement  Coordinating \nCouncil. \n \n6.  The Constitution provides that the Government has a duty not only to prosecute alleged \noffenders, but also to defend indigent persons who are accused of committing crimes.4 The \nPublic Attorney\u2019s Office is the principal organization responsible for fulfilling this constitutional \nduty. In 2006 alone, the Public Attorney\u2019s Office provided assistance to about 4.6 million poor \nclients in a range of criminal, civil, and administrative cases. The Public Attorney\u2019s Office is an \nattached agency to the DOJ for purposes of policy and program coordination, and, unlike NPS, \nis autonomous from DOJ. Autonomy was granted in 2007 in recognition of the Public Attorney\u2019s \nOffice\u2019s responsibility to act in criminal proceedings as the adversary of the NPS, which is under \nthe control of the DOJ Secretary. \n \n7.   The criminal justice system includes the common practices of incarceration of individuals \ncharged  with  serious  offenses,  imprisonment  of  those  convicted,  and  programs  for  the \nrehabilitation of offenders and their reintegration into society.  Administration of correctional and \nrehabilitation facilities is fragmented, and is performed by several agencies. The Bureau of Jail \nManagement  and  Penology  (BJMP)  of  the  DILG  is  responsible  for  the  management  and \noperation of about 1,100 district, city, and municipal jails. These are facilities for the detention of \nthose against whom criminal charges are pending as well as those serving sentences of three \nyears or less. BJMP\u2019s 2007 authorized staffing pattern consists of almost 7,000 positions, more \nthan 98% of which are for uniformed personnel, and includes a prisoner-to-guard ratio of nine \n                                                 \n4  The Constitution guarantees to every person under investigation for the commission of an offense the right to \n\u201ccompetent and independent counsel.\u201d This includes the right of a person who cannot afford counsel to be \nprovided with one.  \n ", "         Appendix 4     59\nprisoners to one guard. Prior to the BJMP\u2019s creation in 1991, the management of these facilities \nwas under the jurisdiction of the PNP. However, stagnant budgets and a growing jail population \nhave impeded the transfer of functions to BJMP. Therefore, about 750 municipal jails remain \nunder PNP control. The Local Government Code also authorizes provincial governments to \noperate jails for detainees awaiting trial and serving sentences of 3 years or less. There are 79 \nprovincial and 25 sub-provincial jails whose wardens are appointed by provincial governors and \nthat operate separately from the BJMP and PNP jails. \n \n8.  The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor), an integral part of the DOJ, operates seven national \npenitentiaries for the incarceration of prisoners serving sentences of more than 3 years. The \nBureau also operates a juvenile training center, completed in 2003, and a drug treatment and \nrehabilitation center created in 2002. As in the case of jails, the population of facilities operated \nby BuCor is growing. The capacity of the nation\u2019s prisons is 19,600, but occupancy exceeds \n25,000. BuCor has about 2,400 authorized positions, of which 60% are in custodial roles, a \nprisoner-to-guard ratio of 3.64 prisoners to one guard. Rounding out the set of corrections and \nrehabilitations institutions are the Board of Pardons and Parole (BPP) and the Parole and \nProbation Administration (PPA), both integral units of DOJ. BPP recommends to the president \nthe grant of pardon and other forms of executive clemency, grants parole to qualified prisoners, \nand authorizes the transfer of residence of parolees and pardonees, orders their arrest and \nrecommitment, or grants their final release and discharge. PPA oversees offenders who are \nlikely to respond to individualized and community-based treatment programs. Both agencies are \nunder the control and supervision of the DOJ Secretary. \n \n9.  Alternative dispute resolution mechanisms exist within and outside the judicial system to \nsettle civil disputes and the civil aspects of criminal cases:  \n(i)  The barangay (village) justice system uses conciliation, mediation, and arbitration \nto resolve disputes between residents of the same municipal unit. Procedures \nare informal, under the direction of the elected barangay chairman. The parties \nmay not be represented by lawyers. The number of cases handled each year \nunder this system approaches the number of cases decided by the Philippine \ncourts. The settlement rate is about 75%. Disputes eligible for consideration \nunder the barangay justice system must use that system before being filed in \ncourt. If the system does not resolve a dispute, a party may take it to the court \nthat otherwise would have jurisdiction.  \n(ii)  A Supreme Court-initiated system of court-annexed mediation is now operating \nwith 731 courts in all regions. Since the institutionalization of court-annexed \nmediation through the establishment of the Philippine Mediation Center (PMC) \nunder  the  Philippine  Judicial  Academy,  several  institutional  innovations  have \nbeen  introduced  such  as  appellate  court  mediation,  family  court  mediation, \nmobile  court-annexed  mediation  and  judicial  dispute  resolution.  With  these \nmediation mechanisms in place, the number of mediated cases dramatically \nincreased from 3,559 in 2002 to 19,825 in 2007, with an average success rate of \n73% \n(iii)  Indigenous populations in the Philippines (exceeding 12 million people) may use \ntheir own commonly-accepted justice systems and institutions, so long as they \nare compatible with national law and internationally-recognized human rights. \nThe  operation  of  customary  legal  systems  is  facilitated  by  the  National \nCommission on Indigenous Peoples, which is authorized to hear appeals from \ndecisions affecting indigenous populations.  \n(iv)  Mediation  and  arbitration  are  available  to  the  public  sector.  The  volume  of \ncommercial mediation  and arbitration remains quite limited. However, a new \nalternative dispute resolution law enacted in 2004 promises to invigorate the use \n ", "60      Appendix 4     \nof these remedies. Implementing regulations have not yet been adopted to make \nthe new legal regime operational. The 2004 Alternative Dispute Resolution Law \nmandates the establishment of an Alternative Dispute Resolution Office in the \nDOJ to facilitate implementation of the law.  \n \n10.  Civil society plays a key role in justice sector reforms in the Philippines, are regularly \nconsulted in the development and implementation of judicial and justice sector reform projects, \nand, on their own initiative, monitor the performance of some justice sector agencies. Among \nthe key civil society stakeholders is the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP). All 40,000 \nattorneys in the country are compulsory members of the IBP. The IBP is a primary channel for \nthe discipline of attorneys, plays an active role in legal education, and provides legal assistance \nto the poor. The Supreme Court allocates a portion of its budget yearly to fund legal aid \nprograms of the IBP. Philippine law schools are also important stakeholders of the justice \nsector. There are about 100 law schools, most of which are voluntary members of the Philippine \nAssociation of Law Schools. Some law schools operate legal clinics through which fourth year \nlaw students, supervised by licensed attorneys, represent indigent clients in court for free. Law \nprofessors, who are often concurrently sitting or retired judges, are frequently called upon to \nprovide legal and policy advice concerning legal and justice sector reforms. Other stakeholders \ninclude organizations that do research, monitor the operation of the courts and government \nagencies, take public positions on justice policy issues, provide information to the public, and \noffer legal services to the poor.5  \n \nB.   Initial Reforms \n \n11.  There  have  been  three  phases  of  reform  since  1986.  An  initial  phase  of  reform \nmeasures  during  the  period  following  the  February  1986  revolution  created  a  sound \nconstitutional basis for an effective justice system, helped to restore the independence of the \njudiciary, and initiated a continuing justice reform effort. A second phase of reform during the \n1990s concentrated on strengthening the human and institutional capabilities that were required \nto respond to the increased workload and growing number of reforms in the judiciary and other \njustice  sector  agencies.  Two  key  examples  of  such  reforms  in  nonjudicial  justice  sector \nagencies were the Justice Sector Infrastructure Program that aimed to build court houses and \nfacilities for prosecutors and public defenders and the creation of the Public Attorney\u2019s Office. A \nthird phase was introduced during the Action Program for Judicial Reform 2001\u20132006 (APJR). \nThe APJR  was a  multi-year plan  (2001\u20132006) that identified, prioritized, and implemented \njudicial  reforms.  It  instituted  a  system  of  coordination  among  justice  organizations  and \ncommunication with stakeholders. Significant achievements include:  \n(i)  improved judicial efficiency demonstrated by an increase in the number of cases \ndisposed by courts;  \n(ii)  a  decreasing  number  of  vacant  judicial  positions  (due  to  the  passage  and \nimplementation  of  a  law  increasing  judicial  remuneration  by  100%,  which \nattracted competent candidates);  \n(iii)  the establishment of 113 court-annexed mediation centers nationwide (intended \nto facilitate access to justice); and \n                                                 \n5  Some notable examples of the foregoing include: the Alternative Law Groups (free legal assistance to vulnerable \nsectors, paralegal training, legal reform advocacy); the Supreme Court Appointments Watch and Court Watch \n(monitoring judicial appointments and court performance); HLAF and Philippine Jesuit Prison Service (development \nof inmate record systems, free legal assistance to detainees, paralegal training, prison reform advocacy); and the \nGerry  Roxas  Foundation  (implementing  USAID-funded  support  for  the  barangay  justice  system,  capacity \ndevelopment of barangay justice advocates, paralegal training, mediation and community justice). \n ", "         Appendix 4     61\n(iv)  decentralization  of  court  administration  functions  (currently  exercised  by  the \nSupreme Court assisted by the Office of the Court Administrator in Manila) to a \npilot regional court administration office (intended to increase efficiency).   \n \n12.   Although the APJR focused on the development of a reform action plan for the judiciary, \nthe  Supreme  Court  encouraged  the  participation  of  other  justice  sector  institutions  in \nconsultations and planning. The APJR proceeded on the assumption that the administration of \njustice was a task shared by the judiciary with the other branches of government and other \npillars of the criminal justice system\u2014the prosecution service, police and law enforcement, \ncorrections, public defense, and the community. Without reforms taking place in other justice \nsector  agencies,  judicial  reforms  risked  being  less  successful  than  expected.6  The  APJR \nproduced  a  series  of  diagnostic  studies  that  provided  the  basis  for  policy  reforms  in  the \nDepartment of Justice, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Public Attorney\u2019s Office, and the \nPhilippine corrections system. Subsequently, the DOJ created a Management Systems Office to \ncoordinate its reform program. The Office of the Ombudsman adopted a Medium Term Anti-\nCorruption Program. The PNP launched its own reform program. The Public Attorney\u2019s Office \nsuccessfully lobbied for a law that implemented the recommendations of an APJR study on \nincreasing the Public Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s autonomy. These studies provided the opportunity in \nbuilding the road map for reform of these institutions.7 \n \n13.  The APJR, which ended in 2006, appears to have contributed to improving the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s credibility. In 2007, the Social Weather Station survey of enterprises on corruption noted \nan increase in survey respondents who found the Supreme Court sincere in fighting corruption \nwas a net 40% in 2006 to a net 46% in 2007. \n \n14.  Upon his assumption into office in 2006, Chief Justice Reynato Puno announced three \nbroad priority areas for the judiciary: (i) the speedy and efficient resolution of court cases, \nincluding administrative cases against judges, lawyers, and court personnel; (ii) improving the \nintegrity of the court; and (iii) access to justice. Under his leadership, the Supreme Court has \ncontinued, with strong support, APJR-initiated reforms falling into the three areas described \nabove. As an example, the Supreme Court has pursued decentralization of the administrative \nand financial management functions to regional court administration offices (expected to speed \nup  overall  court  efficiency,  integrity  and  oversight)  and  designated  22  small  claims  courts \nemploying judicial dispute mediation and expanding the Justice on Wheels Program (to improve \naccess to justice)\u2014all of which were begun during the APJR. This demonstrates a deliberate \nstrategy to focus on APJR reforms that are expected to achieve results in areas that would \nimprove perceptions of court performance and integrity, and increase access to justice.  \n \n15.   The  chief  justice  has  also  demonstrated  concern  for  and  an  understanding  of  the \njudiciary\u2019s resource constraints, as well as an interest in financial management reforms that \nwould facilitate the judiciary\u2019s capability to plan and demonstrate reasonable budget proposals, \nand assert fiscal autonomy (discussed in the section on Sector Issues below) during budget \nexecution. For example, upon being informed that commitment to the Organization Performance \nIndicator Framework (OPIF) would enable the judiciary to plan and explain its budget proposals \nto the executive, which proposes the budget to the legislature, the chief justice expressed \ncommitment  to  the  OPIF  and  the  Supreme  Court  has  submitted  in  2008  documents  that \ndemonstrate such commitment.   \n \n                                                 \n6  See Supreme Court APJR website for more details: http://apjr.supremecourt.gov.ph/ \n7  Hard copies of the DOJ and PNP reform agenda, as well as the Medium-Term Action Plan of the Officer of the \nOmbudsman, are available upon request. \n ", "62      Appendix 4     \n16.   Although the chief justice appears to have focused on reforms that have a direct impact \non  the  judiciary,  he  has  not  abandoned  interest  in  coordinating  justice  reforms.  Since  his \nappointment, he has hosted two multisectoral summits, both of which have been lauded for \ndemonstrating justice sector leadership: the Summit on Extra-judicial Killings, which brought \ntogether criminal justice sector agencies to discuss ways by which the extra-judicial killings may \nbe  halted;  and  the  Summit  on  Increasing  Access  to  Justice,  which  served  both  as  a \nmultisectoral consultative forum and venue for justice sector agencies to discuss possible ways \nby which they could coordinate efforts to bring access to justice. One example of a collaboration \nresulting from the latter is that the City of Manila and the Supreme Court launched a mobile \ncourt unit near the Manila City Jail a month after the Summit. The mobile unit was intended to \nspeed up hearings of detainees at the Manila City Jail. \n \nC.   Sector Issues and Assessment of Performance \n \n17.  Judicial Independence and the Justice Sector. An independent judiciary is a key \nfeature of an efficient justice sector. The Beijing Statement of Principles of the Independence \nof the Judiciary in the Asia Region, an international document signed by 32 chief justices \nfrom  throughout  Asia  and  the  Pacific,  including  the  Philippines,  defines  judicial \nindependence  in  terms  of  a  judiciary  deciding  matters  impartially  \u201cwithout  improper \ninfluences,  direct  or  indirect,  from  any  source.\u201d  The  Beijing  statement  represents  a \nremarkable consensus within the region of the minimum standards that need to be complied \nwith in order to maintain the independence and effective function of the judiciary. It identifies \nthe rule of law to be the aim and object of every justice system\u2014otherwise, legal power \nbecomes an instrument of oppression and corruption. The following are identified in the \nBeijing statement as features of judicial independence:  \n \n(i)  the appointment of competent, incorruptible, and independent judges without \ndiscrimination or undue influence;  \n(ii)  the  security  of  tenure  of  judges,  with  removal  only  for  incapacity  or \ninappropriate conduct as determined  by an independent tribunal;  \n(iii)  judicial remuneration at an appropriate level, and guaranteed for the term of a \njudge\u2019s appointment;  \n(iv)  a guaranteed jurisdiction for a judge that cannot be altered except with the \nconsent of the members of the court; \n(v)  judicial  administration  controlled  by  the  court,  especially  in  relation  to  the \nallocation of cases;  \n(vi)  a relationship with the executive that is free of pressure upon the judiciary; and \n(vii)  adequate resources for the courts. \n \n18.  The Philippines\u2019 colonial history and its experience with martial law contributed to a \nstrong tradition of judicial independence. After the 1986 EDSA Revolution, the 1987 Philippine \nConstitution expanded court jurisdiction to include the power to review Government actions, \nincluding actions of the executive and legislative branches, and provided several measures \ndemonstrating  most  of  the  features  of  judicial  independence  enumerated  in  the  Beijing \nstatement.  \n \n19.  Judicial Fiscal Autonomy. A key provision of the judiciary\u2019s fiscal autonomy is the \nautomatic and regular release of the court\u2019s budget after it has been approved by legislature.8 \nThe same constitutional provision also states that the judiciary\u2019s budget may not be reduced by \n                                                 \n8 Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution; CSC v. DBM, G.R. No. 158791, 10 February 2006. \n ", "         Appendix 4     63\nCongress below the amount appropriated for the previous year.9   Fiscal autonomy aims to \nsafeguard  the  last  feature  of  judicial  independence  under  the  Beijing  statement\u2014that  of \nensuring  the  provision  of  adequate  resources  for  the  judiciary.    However,  despite  the \nconstitutional grant of fiscal autonomy, the Supreme Court has been hampered by effective \nexecutive  control  of  the  budgetary  purse  strings.  In  the  course  of  preparing  the  National \nExpenditure Program, DBM reviews the budget proposals of the judiciary10 on a line-item basis \nand decides which items may or may not be included in the national budget.11  After Congress \nappropriates the budget, DBM allots the judiciary\u2019s budget in one lump sum. However, in the \npast,  cash  disbursements  have  been  released  on  a  transaction  basis.  As  with  executive \ndepartments under the supervision and control of the president, the judiciary is also subjected to \ncash availability timing issues.  \n \n20.  Fiscal Management to Strengthen Judicial Fiscal Autonomy. Arguably, the resource \nconstraints  faced  by  the  Government  limit  the  judiciary\u2019s  fiscal  autonomy,  in  that  the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  position  determines  how  much  it  can  allot  to  the  judiciary  and  other \ngovernment agencies at any given time. However, it is also true that the Government\u2019s fiscal \nmanagement  capabilities\u2014particularly  in  budget  planning\u2014can  play  an  important  role  in \nstrengthening fiscal autonomy, notwithstanding government budget constraints. As an example, \nDBM  schedules  its  disbursement  of  cash  allocations  quarterly  in  accordance  with  the \noperational  cash  program  submitted  by  government  agencies.  Ideally,  a  well  planned \noperational cash program would allow DBM to plan for the disbursement of cash to priority \nagencies\u2014e.g.  fiscally autonomous agencies such as the judiciary\u2014without referring to the \nGovernment\u2019s  fiscal  position  or  reviewing  the  agencies\u2019  expenditures  as  a  precondition  to \nreleasing cash allocations. However, weak fiscal management capabilities and human resource \nconstraints in the Supreme Court result in the preparation of operational cash programs that do \nnot reflect the actual cash requirements of the Supreme Court each quarter. This makes it \nimpossible for DBM to program a realistic schedule of cash disbursements for the judiciary and \nother fiscally autonomous agencies, especially when the Government\u2019s fiscal position is weak.  \n \n21.   Weak  Financial  Management  Capabilities  in  the  Justice  Sector.  Weak  budget \nplanning and monitoring capabilities afflicts all justice sector agencies, and this prevents them \nfrom  justifying  requests  and  ultimately  obtaining  the  resources  that  they  need.  As  budget \nplanning is done at the central office of justice sector agencies, field offices and court stations \nhave even weaker financial management capabilities. These inherent weaknesses, together \nwith the absence of resources in justice sector agencies to exercise stronger oversight functions \nconcerning  their  field  offices  and  the  dearth  of  transparent  procedures  and  accountability \nmechanisms with respect to the agencies\u2019 use of public funds, all contribute to the perception \nthat the agencies are susceptible to corruption. It also contributes to the reluctance of the \noversight agency, DBM, to allow agencies greater flexibility and control over their resources.   \n \n22.  Justice sector agencies under the executive branch\u2014DOJ and its attached agencies \n(e.g., BuCor); the PNP, National Police Commission, and the BJMP, which is under the DILG \u2014\nhave  adopted  the  OPIF,  a  public  expenditure  management  reform  that  directs  resources \ntowards results and accounts for performance.  The leadership of the judiciary also issued a \nstatement early in the year on the judiciary\u2019s commitment to use the OPIF in budget preparation, \nfiscal management, and planning.12 In addition, to showcase the judiciary\u2019s commitment to the \n                                                 \n9  Article VIII, Section 3 of the Philippine Constitution.  \n10 These are the Commission on Elections, the Commission on Audit and the Civil Service Commission. \n11 It will be noted that both the President and the Chief Justice have the statutory authority to realign resources and   \naugment items within the budget of their government branch but only if the budget items exist in the first place. \n12 In 2007, the CTA, Sandiganbayan, and CA began work on their OPIF-compliant budgets, which included the \nsubmission of a logical framework in their budget submissions.  \n ", "64      Appendix 4     \nOPIF, a regional court administration office (RCAO) being piloted by the Supreme Court in \nRegion 7 prepared its proposed 2009 budget following the OPIF template and principles. It is \nexpected  that  adoption  of  the  OPIF  across  the  justice  sector  will  result  in  better  internal \ngovernance arrangements and systems to capture performance data; and provide agencies with \ngreater flexibility and control over their internal resource deployment.13 If done across all sector \nagencies,  it  is  expected  to  provide  a  comprehensive,  precise,  and  unified  articulation  of \naccountability  in  the  use  of  public  resources  by  justice  sector  agencies  to  the  public  and \ncitizenry.  \n \n23.  It should be noted, however, that the adoption of the OPIF is not a rapid process and will \nrequire significant strengthening of justice sector agencies\u2019 financial management systems. \nAgencies in the justice sector need to set their own performance indicators and strategize the \nbest ways to reach these indicators. Measuring the efficient and effective delivery of justice \nrequires  qualitative,  and  not  only  quantitative,  measures.  For  example,  the  quality  and \nlegitimacy of judicial decisions may be as important, if not more important, as the number of \ndecisions issued by a court. The development of benchmarks and reasonable indicators is a \nchallenge for many agencies, which have never engaged before in similar exercises. Some \nagencies, such as the DOJ, which have adopted performance indicators, realize that they do not \nhave the capability or resources to monitor and collect data from their field offices (in DOJ\u2019s \ncase, data from field prosecutors\u2019 offices) to determine whether or not they have reached their \ntargets.  \n \n24.  Centralized financial and administrative management have also contributed to delays \nand inefficient performance. For example, requests to undertake repairs on court houses and \njustice sector buildings, replace equipment, and pay utility bills, need to be submitted to and \nprocessed by the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) in Manila before the required action \ncan be performed by lower courts. Both the judiciary and nonjudicial justice sector agencies \nsuffer from a lack of sufficient telecommunications and information technology infrastructure or \nequipment connecting most courts stations or field offices outside of the national capital region \nto the relevant central office. Thus, requests are not processed quickly. This results in long \ndelays in payment and the suspension of key services performed by court staff. To address the \nadditional  constraints  resulting  from  a  centralized  financial  and  administrative  system,  the \nSupreme Court has piloted an RCAO to perform financial and administrative functions (including \nbudget planning, physical assets, and human resource management) relating to the lower \ncourts in three provinces in Region 7.  The RCAO was launched by Chief Justice Reynato Puno \nin May 2008 and commenced operations in July 2009.  \n \n25.  Resource  Constraints.  Although  the  nominal  level  of  the  court\u2019s  budget  can  be \nprotected by the Constitution, the increases are not high enough to protect against inflation. \nAlthough there have been annual increases in the judiciary\u2019s obligation budget, its value in real \nterms and its share of the national expenditure program has decreased. While there was a slight \nrecovery in real term budgetary allocation in 2007, it is not enough to meet the increasing \ndemands of the courts workload. In fact, the budget allocation of the judiciary in 2007 can buy \nabout  5%  less  goods  and  services  when  compared  to  its  budget  in  2000.  With  national \ngovernment budgetary resources inadequate, the courts must turn to other sources of financing \nfor their operations. Nonjudicial agencies suffer the same budgetary constraints as the judiciary. \nIn general, while annual budgetary allocations increase in nominal terms, the real value of the \nbudgetary allocation has decreased. Over the period 2000 to 2007, total budget in real terms for \nnonjudicial agencies may have dropped by 5%, with the DOJ experiencing a larger decline of \nabout 15%.  \n                                                 \n13 See Organizational Performance Indicator Framework FY2007, DBM (August 2006). \n ", "         Appendix 4     65\n \n26.  While there may have been extenuating reasons for these budgetary restrictions, the \ninefficiencies created and the damage done to the reputation of the justice sector agencies now \nrequires that cooperative approaches be found to reverse these resource constraints. At the \nsame time, when the focus is on these justice sector agencies for failing to achieve a rule of law \nthat is believed satisfactory to the public and the business community in the Philippines, the \nbudgetary restrictions on these agencies needs to be addressed within the context of achieving \nreal gains in the rule of law with the additional public resources allocated to this sector.   \n \n27.  The  impact  of  the  budgetary  compression  led  justice  sector  agencies  to  prioritize \nrecurrent expenses (primarily personnel). The result is that more than 80% of the budgets of \njustice sector agencies\u2019 goes to salaries, leaving less than 15% for maintenance and other \noperational  expenses,  and  less  than  3%  for  capital  investment  (e.g.,  new  facilities  and \nequipment). This deviates from the profile of the national government budget, which devotes \n32% to expenses for personnel services and around 58% to maintenance and other operational \nexpenses. In the justice sector agencies there is a double squeeze on infrastructure, utilities, \nand supplies, which adds further pressure on their operations. Budget constraints have also \nresulted in low salaries that couple with antiquated equipment and infrastructure to create \nvacancies in staff positions and disincentives for efficient performance. As an example, there \nwere 463 vacancies in the judiciary at the end of 2007, equivalent to 20% of the authorized \npositions.14 These vacancies have contributed to a backlog of cases that at the end of 2007 \namounted to about 700,000 cases in all levels of the courts, with more than half in the regional \ntrial courts. The congestion of case dockets is central to a multitude of problems, either as a \ncause or as an effect. In the NPS, at the end of 2007, only 1,500 out of 2,100 positions were \nfilled. \n \n28.   Resource constraints also make justice sector institutions, particularly the judiciary, \nprosecution service, and law enforcement, susceptible to the influence of local government units \n(LGUs). Under the Local Government Code, LGUs may provide contributions to these agencies. \nMany LGUs contribute resources to lower courts, judges, and prosecutors within their territory. \nThese contributions are not recorded in the financial accounting records of the agencies\u2019 central \noffices. These schemes run the risk of undermining the independence of courts and the integrity \nof other justice sector agencies receiving such contributions, a risk that is further heightened by \nthe absence of oversight capabilities in the central offices. \n \n29.   Justice  Delayed.  A  major  and  persistent  challenge  to  the  justice  system  is  the \npersistent perception of delay in the delivery of justice. The Constitution and law impose time \nlimits on the judiciary, but generally have no counterpart provisions for other agencies involved \nin the administration of justice, particularly in phases where the likelihood of delay occurring is \nstrong\u2014during the police investigation, preliminary investigation stages, as well as during the \nenforcement of judgments. Thus, even if it were assumed that the courts kept well within the \ntime limits imposed by the Constitution and the law, the perception of delay in the delivery of \njustice would continue to exist if accused individuals were detained for long periods in police \nfacilities or in district prisons while waiting for a complaint to be filed in court. The interrelated \nnature of justice sector agencies\u2019 operations requires that delay be decreased and prevented in \nall investigation, dispute resolution, and enforcement.  \n \n30.  Until  recently,  total  caseloads  were  increasing  each  year  as  the  volume  of  cases \nentering the system was higher than the volume of cases leaving the system. That is, the \n                                                 \n14 Of the total vacancies of 463 at end of 2007, over 100 was due to the lack of applicants for those positions, mainly \nrelating to the lack of interest in potential applicants serving in rural and remote locations with the inadequate \ninfrastructure and the uniformly low salaries being offered. \n ", "66      Appendix 4     \ndisposition rate was negative. More recently, caseloads have declined slightly because inflows \nhave diminished and the courts are disposing of more cases than are being filed each year. \nHowever, the total number of cases disposed of has been declining despite the increase in the \nnumber of available judges as vacancies have been filled. The improved disposition rate has not \nresulted in significant improvement in the clearance rate, the volume of cases disposed of as a \npercentage of total caseload, and the low clearance rate means that backlogs remain high.  \n \nTable A4: Summary Of Caseload, Disposition, And Clearance Rates,  \n2004\u20132006 \n \n  PENDING  INFLOW  CASELOAD  OUTFLOW  PENDING ON  DISPOSITION  CLEARANCE \nYEAR  ON 1 JAN  31 DEC  RATE (%)  RATE (%) \n2004  751,579  478,019  1,229,598  491,273  738,325  102.77  39.95 \n2005  738,325  449,733  1,188,058  478,563  709,495  106.41  40.28 \n2006  709,495  414,765  1,124,260  445,483  678,777  107.41  39.62 \nSource: Office of the Court Administrator, Supreme Court \nNote:  Excludes Supreme Court. \n \n31.  Improvements in the disposition rate correlate with a number of reforms initiated under \nthe APJR to increase court efficiency, including the pilot use of a caseflow management system \nin Pasay City Courts, and pilot court-annexed mediation and judicial dispute resolution at any \nstage of litigation. In addition, improvements in disposition rate also correlate with a decreasing \nvacancy in judicial positions, a development brought about by an increase in the compensation \nof judges by 100% through the grant of allowances funded by court fees. Further reforms to \nincrease judicial efficiency include the establishment of case management information systems \nin the Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, Sandiganbayan, and Court of Tax Appeals with USAID \nsupport.  \n \n32.  One reason contributing to the fact that backlogs in the disposition of criminal cases \nremain  high  notwithstanding  the  above-mentioned  reforms  is  that  judicial  performance  is \naffected  by  the  performance  of  other  justice  sector  agencies.  Delays  in  criminal  court \nproceedings have reportedly been caused in part by the nonappearance of witnesses, absence \nof prosecutors and public defenders during trial, the dearth of prosecutors and public defenders \n(who reportedly apply for judge positions, as the overall compensation of judges have increased \nsubstantially),  and  law  enforcement  officers\u2019  delay  in  turning  over  evidence  to  the  courts. \nAnother recognized cause of delay in the criminal justice arena is the lengthy and complex \nprocedures of the NPS for the determination of probable cause. To address this, NPS has \ncompleted  a  review  of  its  business  processes  and  is  working  on  a  prosecution  case \nmanagement  system  to  enable  NPS  to  track  probable  cause  cases being  resolved  by  its \nprosecutors. \n \n33.  Access to Justice.  Access to justice is most commonly associated with access to the \ncourts and the provision of legal counsel to those who cannot afford one. The Constitution \nmakes it the Government\u2019s duty to assure citizens free access to the courts and adequate legal \nassistance that \u201cshall not be denied to any person by reason of poverty.\u201d15 If a member of a \npoor family in the Philippines were accused of a crime, the family would likely be unable to pay \nfor legal fees, even if the counsel for the accused provided his or her services for free. The \nFree Legal Assistance Group, a non-government lawyers\u2019 organization that provides free legal \nassistance, estimated that the typical cost of a criminal case that is handled pro bono could be \nas high as P70, 300, which \u201crepresents the subsistence budget for an entire Filipino family of \nsix for an entire year,\u201d and is three times more than the average annual savings of a Filipino \n                                                 \n15  Const. art. III, sec. 14. \n ", "         Appendix 4     67\nfamily based on official government statistics.16 In addition, the poor would have difficulty in \nposting bail for temporary freedom pending trial, providing travel costs for witnesses to attend \ntrial hearings, or complying with documentary requirements. The costs are higher if free legal \nassistance is not provided. Private legal practitioners are said to charge an acceptance fee at \nthe start of their engagement and an appearance fee for attending hearings. Acceptance fees \nare usually above P10, 000, while appearance fees amounted to P1, 000.17 \n \n34.  The Supreme Court has tried to operationalize the constitutional provision to provide free \naccess to the courts by issuing a rule that exempts the poor from paying docket and other fees, \nincluding fees for the transcript of court proceedings kept by the court stenographer.18 Under the \nAPJR, a Justice on Wheels program was established. Three mobile courts were deployed to \nbring court stations to remote areas and detention facilities far from court stations. Under Chief \nJustice Reynato Puno\u2019s leadership, a multisectoral summit on increasing access to justice by \nthe poor was held to enable the Supreme Court to consider reforms that would effectively \nincrease access to the courts. As regards the constitutional mandate to provide the poor with \nadequate legal counsel, the Supreme Court provides relevant protections to the rights of the \naccused and providing free legal counsel to the poor in the Rules of Court.19 It has also adopted, \nas part of the Code of Professional Responsibility of Lawyers, the rule that lawyers cannot (i) \nreject the case of the defenseless or the oppressed; (ii) refuse to serve the needy; (iii) decline \nan appointment as counsel de officio or a request from the IBP Philippines to render free legal \naid.20  \n \n35.  The Public Attorney\u2019s Office, an autonomous office of public defenders whose services \nindigents  may  access  for  free,  was  created  to  fulfill  the  constitutional  mandate  to  the \nGovernment to provide adequate legal counsel for the poor.  Private sector efforts that are \nintended to increase indigents\u2019 access to courts include free legal services offered by the) IBP \nand  law  school-based  legal  aid  clinics,  where  senior  law  students  supervised  by  qualified \nattorneys appear before courts to represent indigent clients. \n \n36.  Access to justice in the Philippine context means more than free legal assistance or \ncourt-related assistance for the poor. The Constitution also promotes the rights of what are \nperceived to be the most vulnerable sectors in Philippine society and accords a high priority to \nsocial justice, guarantees full respect for human rights, and ensures the fundamental equality of \nwomen  and  men.  It  is  replete  with  policies  favoring  labor,  and  recognizes  the  rights  of \nindigenous cultural communities within the framework of national unity and development. In this \ncontext, access to justice refers to defending, or promoting, the rights of the groups identified in \nthe Constitution as being in need of special protection\u2014women, children, indigenous peoples, \nlabor, and the urban poor.21 The constitutional mandate \u201cdoes not require a judge to exhibit \nsensitivity to parties of a case at the expense of impartiality. Rather, it merely requires a judge to \nprovide special protection for those particularly identified in the Constitution as marginalized,\u201d \nand the challenge is how the judiciary can apply \u201cthis\u2026legal framework to concrete cases \ninvolving vulnerable sectors with predictability and consistency.\u201d22  \n                                                 \n16   Lawyers\u2019 League for Liberty. 2004.

Access to justice by detained prisoners is currently a major problem \nin the Philippines. The number of detainees in BJMP-managed jails has increased considerably \nin recent years. From about 35,000 in 2000, the number of detainees grew to exceed 62,000 in \n2006. About 10% are women and 2% are minors. Metro Manila jails reportedly hold 400 times \nmore prisoners than their official capacity. A rehabilitation center in Cebu that was built for 400 \nwas crammed with 2,600 detainees until recently.  Over 95% of persons in BJMP-managed jails \nare detainees whose cases are still being tried and are not yet sentenced. Often detainees \nserve more time awaiting their trial than they would have for a conviction if their cases had been \npromptly processed following their arrest. \n \n38.  An inmate record system has been set up in pilot jails managed by the BJMP to more \neffectively monitor the inflow and outflow of detainees awaiting trial. The judiciary is deploying \nthree  Justice  on  Wheels  buses  to  jails  and  detention  centers  to  expedite  the  release  of \ndetainees when warranted. It is expected that this problem of detainees can be reduced over \nthe medium term involving a set of focused actions coordinated with BuCor, BJMP, DOJ, DILG \nand the Supreme Court, in coordination with non-government organizations and development \npartners. The actions will include enhancements of BJMP\u2019s pilot inmate record systems and the \ndevelopment of a rollout plan. Detainees who have stayed beyond the incarceration period that \nwould have been meted, had they been convicted of the crime, would be set free, thereby \ndecongesting overcrowded city and municipal jails. With the support of civil society and legal aid \ngroups, such actions can be implemented and monitored. Coordinating these actions with the \nSupreme  Court\u2019s  Justice  on  Wheels  Program  will  put  in  place  a  comprehensive  jail \ndecongestion program.  \n ", "  Appendix 5  69 \n \n \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title: Philippines/Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program \nSoutheast Asia \nDepartment/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nProgram Cluster  Governance, \nModality:  Division: \nFinance, and Trade \nDivision \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \n \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n \nThe Millennium Declaration signed by 189 heads of state in 1995 affirmed the global commitment to a \u201cmore peaceful, \nprosperous and just world\u201d. The declaration sets forth the six values underpinning this commitment including freedom of fear \nfrom  injustice,  equality  of  men  and  women\u2019s  rights,  solidarity,  tolerance  of  diversity,  respect  for  nature,  and  shared \nresponsibility. The core values are translated into action through the Millennium Development Goals.  The program cluster \ndirectly addresses freedom from fear and equality.   \n \nThe program cluster is aligned with the MTPDP strategy and objective on social justice and basic needs. The MTPDP \nrecognized the important link between rule of law and institutional reforms, and the strategy to fight poverty and promote \ninclusive growth. ADB strategy has identified the strengthening of Philippine institutions engaged in the administration of \njustice as critical to improving the investment climate and promoting inclusive growth. In this regard, the proposed program \ncluster will help create efficient and effective delivery of justice services to the public on a non-differentiated basis. Its focus on \naccess to justice by the poor and women helps protect their access to social and other assets that will help them create \nsustainable livelihoods, an important step towards reducing poverty, as was determined under the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) poverty assessment for the Philippines. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nThe Philippine Governance in Justice Sector Reform Program is a general-intervention (GI) project that seeks to shorten the \ntime and lower the cost of gaining justice for all, and to improve the capacity of the judiciary and key justice agencies to \nrespond  to  complaints,  particularly  those  related  to  violence  against  women  and  children,  as  well  as  gender-based \ndiscrimination.  The direct beneficiaries of the project are all users of justice services through improved governance of the \njustice system. Both poor and non-poor people will be able to access improved justice sector services.  The poor and women \nwill disproportionally benefit from the program because they are the least able to afford or wait for justice.   \n \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis  \n \nThe Governance in Justice Sector Reform Cluster Program has five components or policy action areas: (i) strengthened \njudicial fiscal autonomy and justice sector accountability, and improved access to resources; (ii) enhanced justice sector \nintegrity; (iii) improved efficiency in the justice sector; (iv) increased access to justice by poor and vulnerable groups; and (v) \nexpanded delivery of justice through alternative dispute resolution.  \n \nA participatory poverty impact assessment was conducted through separate interviews and focus group discussions in the \nprogram\u2019s pilot site for the Regional Court Administrator\u2019s Office, Cebu City.  The barriers to justice for the poor include \ncumbersome procedures for small claims; the impact of long litigation times on livelihoods and income generation; for those in \njail awaiting trial, court congestion results in additional financial burden on poor families; the actual cost of court litigation is \nbeyond the capacity of poor families; and underserved areas increase transport costs bring the overall cost of justice beyond \nthe ability of to pay of the poor. Non-financial barriers include inadequate understanding of basic legal rights and procedures, \nand the belief that judges will always side with the non-poor.  Poor gender sensitivity among judges, Supreme Court lawyers, \nclerks, and legal researchers disadvantage women. Insensitive treatment of plaintiffs in crimes specific to women and \nchildren, such as violence against women and children, and sexual harassment, remains a significant issue.  \n \nPolicy action area 1 has a positive indirect and medium term impact on the poor. Improved access to resources will enable \nmodernization of the court system, higher salaries necessary to draw and maintain justice system positions with competent \nstaff, and the increased independence and improved governance of the justice system. This will promote an efficient and \n ", "70  Appendix 5 \n \neffective court system and reduce the time and expense of litigation, thereby increasing affordability.  Increased judicial \nbudgets operation will reduce the reliance on litigant fees and charges, which is a pro-poor measure since the poor currently \nbear a disproportionate cost of general operations relative to their income. Policy action area 2 increases the pro-poor \nreputation of the system currently seen as favoring those with the ability to pay. In the medium term, demonstrated fairness \nwill encourage the poor to seek remedy through the legal system. Even for those not involved in litigation, the knowledge of a \nfair system will increase their sense of security and well being. Policy area 3 supports efficiency in the justice sector and \ndecongests the courts and jails. This has an indirect measure with very positive impact on litigants, particularly the poor as the \naverage litigation time in lower courts is 3\u20134 years. The incarcerated, generally the poor who are unable to raise bail, \nexperience highly adverse impacts on their family in monetary and psychological terms. The psychological impact, although \ndifficult to quantify, can result in the break-up of the family with severe emotional consequences for the children. For the 10% \nwho are eventually sentenced, time spent waiting trial often exceeds the jail term meted.  For the remaining 90%, no \nrestitution is available.  Policy area 4 has medium-term direct and indirect benefits for the poor and women. The direct \nbenefits arise from implementation of the gender action plan to improve women\u2019s access to justice in general and the \nsensitive handling of issues specific to women such as violence and sexual harassment.  The indirect actions include the \nsimplification of small claims enabling the faster and lower cost resolution of civil cases. Policy area 5 expands the delivery of \njustice through alternative dispute resolution and provides lower cost measures for resolving civil cases. The court-annexed \nmediation system provides access to trained mediators with legal skills to assist disputing parties to avoid litigation.  This \nsystem complements the barangay (village) justice system, the main recourse of the poor. \n \nII. SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA. Social Analysis \n \nRule of law is one of the basic needs of all Filipinos according to the Medium Term Philippine Development Plan. The \nprogram has been designed to meet the key areas that benefit the majority of the population who are not involved in litigation \nand for the minority that are. The program contributes to human security, reduces vulnerability to injustices that are beyond \nthe capacity of the poor, and provides access to restitution should it be necessary. For those involved in litigation, the program \ndevelops the quality of the justice system through better trained and gender-sensitized judges, court personnel, and mediators \nwhile providing a more expedient and affordable remedy.    \nB.  Consultation and Participation \nHigh-level and working-level consultations were held before and during the extended Fact-Finding Mission completed in July \n2008. Moreover, the policy matrix of the cluster program was presented for comments and discussed extensively with \nstakeholders, including those in Cebu, the pilot site for the RCAO, in May 2008.  The pro-poor focus of the program was \nguided by focus group discussions with community-level stakeholders in Cebu City, including micro-entrepreneurs, barangay \ncouncil members, and women\u2019s and other community level associations. In addition, consultations were held with organized \nnon-government organizations focusing on the justice system, including Supreme Court Appointments Watch, Humanitarian \nLegal Assistance Foundation (HLAF), the Gerry Roxas Foundation, the Philippine Jesuit Prison Service Foundation, and the \nIntegrated Bar of the Philippines.  \n \n2.  What level of consultation and participation (C&P) is envisaged during the project implementation and monitoring?  \n  Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making       Empowerment \n \nProgram reforms include elements of information sharing, consultation, collaborative decision making, and empowerment. \nExamples of these are: (i) increasing the transparency and accountability of budgets and processes; (ii) creation of a justice \nsector agency-wide coordination council to provide policy guidance for the development, implementation, financing, and \nreview of a justice sector policy and a sector wide approach to reforms. Development and expansion of alternative dispute \nresolution mechanisms empowers communities to meet their justice needs.       \n \n3.  Was a C&P plan prepared?   Yes      No  \n \nThe specific actions described are incorporated in the policy reforms to be implemented by the implementing agencies.  \nC.   Gender and Development \nThe GJRP Program has been developed based on extensive consultations with relevant stakeholders (the Judiciary, judicial \nsector and law enforcement agencies) on the constraints and challenges faced by their respective institutions to promote the \neffective application of pro-poor and gender-responsive policies, strategies and programs. Critical impediments to women\u2019s \nequal access to judicial services were documented in a gender assessment carried out by the Government of the Philippines \n(The Government) under the Action Program for Judicial Reform 2001\u20132006 (APJR). These included: (i) women and \ndisadvantaged groups have limited knowledge of their rights; (ii) court processes as well as processes under other justice \nsector agencies, are not sensitive to the conditions and circumstances of women and other disadvantaged groups; (iii) and \nalthough there have been a number of gender sensitivity trainings for judges and other members of the court and the PNP, \nthe justice sector staff has low awareness or appreciation of gender issues, especially in the area of gender-based violence \n ", "  Appendix 5  71 \n(GBV). Building on these findings and the project-specific social/gender analysis, the Program has been designed to \nincorporate gender design features in all of its subcomponents. GAD-relevant conditions for tranche release have been \nincluded in the Policy Matrix [see policy actions 4.1.4, 4.1.5 and 5.3.1 under subprogram 1 and 2 (Appendix 2)]. In addition, \nthe Government has requested the ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) grant to support the implementation of the \nGJRP. The TA , in its output 2, includes a range of activities aimed at increasing the gender capacity of the Judiciary, selected \njudicial and enforcement agencies to address critical issues related to GBV. The activities will be implemented by a national \norganization (nongovernment organization or academic institution) in consultation with the Committee on Gender \nResponsiveness in the Judiciary (CGRJ) at the SC, the Committee on Gender and Development of the DOJ and the Human \nRights Office of the Philippine National Police.  \n2.
