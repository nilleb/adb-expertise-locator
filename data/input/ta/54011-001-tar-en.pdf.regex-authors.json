THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The  Disaster  Resilient  Clean  Energy  Financing  Project  is  to  provide  a  financial \nintermediation grant to the Republic of Palau to create the access of low income and female \nborrowers to affordable disaster resilient clean energy financing. The assistance is planned to be \nprovided as a grant equivalent of up to $3 million to create the Disaster Resilient Clean Energy \nFinancing (DRCEF) by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and on-lent by the National Development \nBank of Palau (NDBP). It will be ADB\u2019s first-ever financial intermediation (FI) project in Palau and \nPacific Developing Member Countries (Pacific DMCs) that targets exclusively disaster resilient \nclean energy financing available for low income and women beneficiaries. \n \n2.  The outputs of the project will include: (i) disaster resilient clean energy financing for \neligible borrowers made available; (ii) accessibility to disaster resilient clean energy loans for \neligible women borrowers improved, and (iii) capacity and awareness of stakeholders increased. \nThe outcome will be consumers\u2019 energy expenditures reduced.1  The impact will be aligned with \n(i) access to disaster resilient clean energy for consumers increased (Palau Energy Policy); (ii) \nsafe, resilient and prepared communities for calamities and women livelihood recovery enhanced \n(National  Disaster  Resilient  Risk  Management  Framework);  and  (iii)  resilience  of  Palau \ncommunities to climate change and disasters enhanced (Palau Climate Change Policy).   \n \n3.  While the ADB funding is a grant basis, however, it will be on-lent by the NDBP at cost of \nadministration and risk premium, to provide affordable financing to low income and women \ncustomers for disaster resilient clean energy projects. Sub-loans provided by NDBP will be used \nby the borrowers for: (i) purchase and installation of energy efficient solar water heaters complying \nwith disaster resiliency and energy efficiency (20% of loans funded by ADB FI grant); and (ii) \npurchase and installation of roof-top solar generation (80% of loans funded by ADB FI grant). A \nminimum 50% of all loans funded by the ADB will be used to finance low-income borrowers.  \nFurthermore, at least 20% of loans funded by ADB and disbursed by NDBP will be to women \nborrowers.  \n \n4.  The project will have a financial intermediation grant modality and is estimated to cost $3 \nmillion funded by the Japanese Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR). The project will directly \nbenefit 900 households in Palau, including at least 450 low-income households and 180 women \nheaded households. NDBP will disburse 20% of loans funded by ADB to women borrowers and \nprovide women headed households access to concessional financing. The direct and indirect \nproject beneficiaries will make about 3,000 persons with household members of the borrowers, \nincluding children, ageing population and people with disabilities that are more vulnerable to \nexternal shocks.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n5.  The Palau government has taken some important steps to improve the country\u2019s resilience \nto calamities and disaster risks. Approved in 2010, the National Disaster and Risk Management \nFramework (NDRMF) sets out a vision of \u201csafe, resilient and prepared communities in Palau\u201d \nharmonizing planning for disaster resiliency, risk mitigation and recovery measures integrated into \nnational planning. The NDRMF draws special attention to women in livelihood recovery and to \nstrengthening disaster risk management for local communities. In 2015, the government adopted \n \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2 \nthe Palau Climate Change Policy (PCCP) for Climate and Disaster Resilient Low Emissions \nDevelopment with additional objective to mitigate global climate change by working toward low-\ncarbon  emission  development,  maximizing  energy  efficiency,  protecting  carbon  sinks,  and \nminimizing greenhouse gas emissions. The PCCP advocates a proactive approach to community-\nlevel disaster risk management and includes specific interventions for: (i) funding support to \nexpand the NDBP energy efficiency program through finance for constructing new and retrofitting \nexisting homes; and (ii) developing, adopting and implementing a climate/disaster resilient energy \nefficient building code.2  \n \n6.  The objective of the transaction technical assistance (TA) is to facilitate implementation of \nthe project which is expected to create DRCEF as a revolving facility on-lent by the NDBP for \nborrowers for: (i) acquisition of purchase and installation of solar water heaters (20% of loans \nfunded by ADB FI grant); and (ii) purchase and installation of roof-top solar generation (80% of \nloans funded by ADB FI grant). It is expected that at least 50% of all loans financed by the ADB \ngrant proceeds disbursed to poor and low-income borrowers with a household income of less \nthan $13,200 per annum by 2024.  \n  \n 7.  The TA will address technical matters of project implementation and will be attached to a \nfinancial intermediation grant for the project. The TA is consistent with the objectives of ADB \nPacific Approach, 2016\u22122020 emphasizing the importance of expanding ADB work in climate \nchange and disaster risk management to mobilize more financing for the Pacific region and to \nintroduce innovative solutions to strengthen disaster preparedness, address vulnerability, and \nbuild resilience to natural calamities.3  \n \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  The TA is to support Output 2 and Output 3 of the project.  \n \n9.  Output 2. Accessibility to disaster resilient clean energy loans for eligible women \nborrowers improved. The project will make significant impact on empowering women and \nimproving women access to finance. The consultants will prepare: (i) a gender inclusive lending \npolicy to improve accessibility to NDBP lending products for eligible women borrowers; (ii) set up \na sex-disaggregated database in the NDBP for monitoring the project and lending activities of the \nNDBP with gender lens and impacts; and (iii) credit reporting procedures for all women-borrowers \nfacilitating women\u2019s future borrowing at lower interest rates and access to higher loan amounts, \nthat will be a significant economic opportunity and empowerment for women. \n \n10.  Output  3.  Capacity  and  awareness  of  stakeholders  increased.  The  project  will \nincrease capacity and awareness of stakeholders about the energy efficiency and climate change \nresilience technologies by supporting the NDBP to: (i) conduct extensive public outreach and \nawareness raising with national stakeholders including the civil society organizations and women \nfrom communities; (ii) conduct at least three nationwide workshops on DRCEF with social and \ngender sensitive participatory approach and minimum 30% women participants, (iii) develop and \ndisseminate the communication and awareness materials tailored to the needs of women and \nlow-income borrowers; (iv) training of technicians including at least 20% women as operators for \ninstallation,  operations  and  maintenance  of  the  rooftop  solar  energy  panels;  and  (v)  a \ncomprehensive  database  of  all  installations  including  technical  performance  information  of \n \n2  Draft Palau Housing Policy (2019) includes a section on minimum standards for housing construction options including provisions \nfor newly developed homes (e.g., standards set forth in the International Residential Code, 2015 Edition be satisfied, and new \nhomes are designed to maximize energy efficiency, and produce and/or utilize renewable energy sources.  \n3  ADB Pacific Approach is overall country partnership strategy for the 11 smaller Pacific island countries, including Palau. The TA is \nproposed in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Palau, 2021\u20132023.  \n ", "3 \nselected  rooftop  solar  photovoltaic  systems  will  be  established  and  maintained  to  analyze \nperformance of installed systems and monitoring of potential technical shortcomings.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby  the  ADB's  Technical  Assistance  Fund (TASF  6).  The  government will  provide  $50,000 \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe value of government contribution is estimated to account for 11% of the total TA cost. The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA and will select, supervise and evaluate consultants, and \nprocure goods. \n \n13.  The MOF will be the executing agency. The NDBP will be the implementing agency for \nthe TA. The MOF and NDBP have experience and capacity in implementing externally funded \nprojects  and  TAs,  including  those  financed  other  development  partners.  NDBP  previously \nimplemented a pilot financing of $1 million for rooftop solar power generation development as a \ncomponent of the cooperation with bilateral agencies.  \n \n14.
