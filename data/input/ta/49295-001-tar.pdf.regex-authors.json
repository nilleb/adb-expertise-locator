INTRODUCTION \n1.  This policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) has been developed at the request of \nthe Municipal Government of Ulaanbaatar (MGU). Through this TA, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) will support the MGU to reach agreements on (i) a bus rapid transit (BRT) service \nplan and a BRT business plan with bus operators; and (ii) e-ticketing system implementation \nwith the MGU, bus operators, and e-ticketing system investors. In September 2015, ADB and \nthe MGU reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncost, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \nThe TA is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Mongolia, 2015.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Ulaanbaatar,  the  capital  city  of  Mongolia,  has  1.37  million  residents.  The  city  was \ndeveloped according to Soviet-style urban planning concepts from the 1950s. Most of the city \ntoday is the result of construction from 1960 to 1985. Urban development and expansion have \nbeen accelerated by economic growth fueled by the mining boom and population influx from \nrural  areas.  The  city  center  still  retains  an  urban  area  suitable  for  public  transport  and \npedestrians,  but  it  has been  transformed  into a  high-density  urban  area  by  new  high-rise \nbuildings in the city center and surrounding areas, and by the spread of low-income ger3 areas \naround the city center. Effective mobility and accessibility solutions for residents have not kept \npace with increasing travel demand and the rapid increase of motorization.4 Recent economic \ngrowth has led to rapid motorization, resulting in traffic congestion, air pollution from vehicles, \nand traffic safety problems throughout the city.5 \n \n3.  Public transport is provided by two government-owned and 11 private operators (50 \ntrolley buses and 600 buses in total) that served almost 60% of urban travel demand in 2015. \nHowever, the modal share of public transport is decreasing, as motorization has accelerated \nduring the last five years. Public transport has neither been expanded nor improved properly to \naccommodate new urban development and the increased mobility needs of urban residents. \nThe service quality of public transport has been constrained by increasing traffic congestion, \noutdated public transport management without service monitoring, and poor coordination among \nthe urban development agencies including Road Department and Urban Transport Department. \nThese factors have also had a negative impact on the economic growth of the city and quality of \nlife. \n \n4.  Despite  deficiencies  in  the  public  transport  service  environment,  the  MGU  has \nmaintained control over the public transport industry by providing fare compensation to 13 \noperators, establishing a bus fund to supply new vehicles to the operators with installment \ncontracts, consolidating small private operators into bigger consortia, and maintaining low fares \nfor the benefit of low-income passengers. However, the MGU\u2019s efforts have so far failed to \nattract passengers or reverse the declining service standard. \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 October 2015. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2015. Manila. \n3  Ger is a portable, round tent covered with skins or felt and used as a dwelling by nomads in the steppes of Central \nAsia.  \n4  The number of vehicles registered in Ulaanbaatar has increased from 220,000 vehicles in 2010 to 480,000 vehicles \nin 2014. \n5  Five-year (2011\u20132015) compounded annual gross domestic product (PPP) growth rate was 9.2%. \n ", "2 \n5.  To  restore  and  improve  declining  public  transport  services  in  Ulaanbaatar,  ADB \napproved the Urban Transport Development Investment Program in 2012.6 The Government of \nMongolia  signed  the  loan  agreement  in  2015,  and  the  Mongolian  Parliament  ratified  the \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) in May 2015.7 The implementation of the MFF tranche 1 \nhas started in May 2015. The MFF, which includes three tranches, focuses on developing a \ncitywide BRT network with (i) exclusive median BRT lanes; (ii) fully enclosed modern BRT \nstations; and (iii) modern information technology systems, including a bus management system, \na bus information system, and an e-ticketing system. \n \n6.  Since the approval of the MFF in 2012, there have been two changes in the public \ntransport sector: (i) there are now fewer bus operators due to restructuring,8 and (ii) the public\u2013\nprivate partnership (PPP) modality was introduced into the e-ticketing system. These changes \ncreated the need for specialized assistance from ADB before the MGU implements the BRT \nsystem. \n \n7.  The implementation of the BRT system is a big challenge both for the MGU and the \npublic  transport  industry,  as  installation  and  operation  of  the  BRT  requires  institutional \narrangements  that  can  provide  service  and  business  plan  support,  and  assist  with  the \nintroduction of an e-ticketing system. The TA will provide policy and advisory services to the \nMGU  and  public  and  private  bus  operators  and  e-ticketing  system  investors  to  resolve \ninstitutional challenges. Successful implementation of the outputs of the TA will benefit the MGU, \nbus operators, the investors, and all public transport users in Ulaanbaatar by improving the \nsustainability and quality of the existing BRT system. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact will be improved public transport services for the residents of Ulaanbaatar. \nThe  outcome  will  be  the  establishment  of  an  efficient  and  sustainable  BRT  operational \nframework in Ulaanbaatar by 2017. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will be conducted through a series of consultations leading to agreement with \nthe MGU, bus operators, and investors on (i) BRT service and business plans, and (ii) the \nimplementation of an e-ticketing system through PPP. \n \n10.  A recommended BRT service plan will be (i) prepared based on the passenger demand \nprofile  forecasted  for  the  BRT  corridor  using  a  public  transport  analysis  method,9 and \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Multitranche \nFinancing Facility and Technical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Urban Transport Development Investment \nProgram. Manila. \n7  Under tranche 1, two loans (Loans 2934-MON and 2935-MON) and one technical assistance grant (TA 0315-\nMON) were signed. \n8  Three government-owned companies were restructured into two companies from three companies, and 26 private \ncompanies were reduced to 11 companies. The private companies established the Ulaanbaatar Bus Operators \nAssociation, which increased their influence on public transport policy. \n9  Public transport analysis methods included passenger demand analysis, and station-to-station and time of day \npassenger demand profile analysis.  \n ", "3 \n(ii) generated on the basis of service criteria.10 The service plan will be interpreted according to \nbusiness plan options.11 In preparing business plan options, the bus operators\u2019 financial status \nand company structure, and the bus industry\u2019s regulations will be considered. The service and \nbusiness plans for BRT will be discussed and agreed on by the bus operators and the MGU. \n \n11.  For the implementation of the e-ticketing system through PPP, a detailed review of the \nexisting PPP agreement between the MGU, bus operators, and e-ticketing investors will be \nconducted to identify potential risks. The review will focus on the financial implications of the \nPPP general agreement on operators, its financial sustainability, and its legal soundness. On \nthe  basis  of  the  review  and  consultation  with  the  MGU,  operators,  and  investors,  a \nrecommended PPP agreement will be prepared for consideration and agreement by the MGU, \noperators, and investors. \n \n12.  The process and outputs of the TA activities will be documented, and two knowledge \nproducts (the first on the BRT service and business plans, and the second on using PPP to \nimplement the e-ticketing system) will be prepared and disseminated to ADB\u2019s developing \nmember countries. \n \n13.  The TA will include three outputs: \n(i)  Output  1:  BRT  service  plan  and  business  plan  between  the  MGU  and  bus \noperators for the introduction of BRT system proposed; \n(ii)  Output 2: PPP agreement for e-ticketing system operation between the MGU, \nbus operators, and e-ticketing investors proposed; and \n(iii)  Output  3:  Knowledge  products  on  BRT  service  plan  and  business  plan \ndevelopment, and PPP for e-ticketing system prepared. \n \n14.  Possible  risks  include  government  change  and  disagreement  between  the  MGU, \noperators, and investors that could delay agreements on BRT service plan and business plan, \nand the introduction of e-ticketing through PPP. Continuous policy dialogue with the executing \nagency and selection of highly qualified international consultants with specific experience in \ndeveloping public transport business plans and implementing e-ticketing projects through PPP \nwill mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $385,000, of which $350,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility and administered by ADB. The MGU \nwill provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, suitably furnished office space \nwith utilities and telecommunication access, information materials, data, and other documents \nas needed, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  executing  agency  is  the  MGU.  The  Urban  Transport  Department,  which  is \nresponsible for developing and supervising Ulaanbaatar\u2019s public transport policy and e-ticketing \nsystem, will be the implementing agency. The Public Transport Committee, which is the steering \ncommittee for the Urban Transport Development Investment Program (para. 5), will serve as an \n                                                \n10 Service criteria mainly included BRT service frequency or headways, in-bus congestion limit, vehicle types, and \nquality and travel time regularity.  \n11 The business plan options include area contract or route contract with net cost or gross cost and allocation of \ndifferent operators\u2019 service routes to BRT service plan. \n ", "4 \noversight body for the TA. The implementing agency will provide office accommodation, public \ntransport-related documents, statistics, and the remuneration of counterpart staff required for \nthe implementation of the TA. \n \n17.  The TA will commence on 30 November 2015 and will be completed on 30 April 2016. It \nwill require a total of 26 person-months of consulting services, comprising 9 person-months of \ninputs from four international consultants and 17 person-months of inputs from five national \nconsultants. ADB will engage individuals, as the TA requires specific expertise and experience. \nThe  consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The international and national consultant \nteams  will  comprise  (i)  public  transport  specialist,  (ii)  public  transport  PPP  specialist, \n(iii) transport PPP legal specialist, (iv) transport financial specialist, and (v) national project \ncoordinator.  All  consultants  will  be  contracted  with  lump-sum-based  contracts.  All \ndisbursements under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Trainings and seminars will be \nadministered by the consulting team. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof Mongolia to be financed on a grant basis by the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility \nfor Public\u2013Private Partnership in Urban Public Transport Sector of Ulaanbaatar, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the Technical Assistance Project is Aligned with \nPublic transport services for the residents of Ulaanbaatar improved (Urban Development Master Plan Update)a \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nEfficient and sustainable  By 2017  Annual report of the  MGU change due to the \nBRT operational  Municipality of Ulaanbaatar  national government \na.  100% of BRT service \nframework established  and monthly reports of  change delays \noperators sign agreements \nin Ulaanbaatar by 2017  Urban Transport  agreements on BRT \nwith the MGU (2015 baseline: \nDepartment  operational framework and \nnot applicable) \ne-ticketing PPP \nb.
