THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan; and (ii) a proposed grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan; and (iii) a proposed loan to Tangsibji \nHydro Energy Limited (THyE), to be guaranteed by the Kingdom of Bhutan, for the Second \nGreen Power Development Project.1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Acceleration of Hydropower Trading Development, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loans and grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe TA. \n \n2.   The project will finance the run-of-river Nikachhu hydropower plant, with 118-megawatt \n(MW) capacity. It is located on the Nikachhu River in Trongsa district in the central region of \nBhutan. The project aims to export power to India through a public\u2013private partnership (PPP) \nand the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).2 Its design follows the successful model of the \nDagachhu hydropower plant (126 MW), which was financed by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) in 2008 under the Green Power Development Project.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Overview. Bhutan is currently the only South Asian country with a surplus of power for \nexport. The country's installed generation capacity (1,614 MW) is significantly greater than its \ndomestic demand (around 300 MW); hence Bhutan is a net power exporter. Of total power \ngenerated, about 75% is exported to India. Hydropower generation contributes to one-fifth of the \ncountry\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP). Power exports account for one-third of government \nrevenue, and are the primary source for government spending on socioeconomic development \nfor social services such as health, education, and rural development.4 Hydropower development \nthus forms the foundation of the economy and social system in Bhutan.  \n \n4.  Along with hydropower development, quality of life and overall socioeconomic status has \nsignificantly improved. Poverty decreased from 32% in 2003 to 12% in 2012. However, in spite \nof increasing public spending for social and rural development and an increase in per capita \nincome (more than $2,500 in 2012), Bhutan remains below the graduation threshold of least \ndeveloped countries in terms of the human asset index and the economic vulnerability index as \ndefined by the United Nations.5  \n \n5.  The  national  electrification  ratio  has  increased from  38%  in  2003 to 98%  in  2014; \nelectricity for all is being achieved. In Bhutan, domestic power supplies are subsidized by \nhydropower exports. The government uses the energy royalty from hydropower generation to \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Preparing the Green Power Development Project II. \nManila.  \n3  ADB. 2008. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Asian \nDevelopment Fund Grant, Technical Assistance Grant, and Administration of Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \nthe Green Power Development Project. Manila.  \n4  Hydropower revenues have enabled high spending on social services (health and education) and renewable \nnatural resources (agriculture, livestock, and forestry). Government spending in those areas has increased steadily, \naccounting for more than one-third of total government consumption and demonstrating the government\u2019s priority \naccorded to human development. This spending is among the highest level in South Asia. \n5  The human asset indicators are based on nutrition, health, and education including literacy. The economic \nvulnerability indicators include population size; remoteness; merchandise export concentration; and share of \nagriculture, forestry, and fisheries in gross domestic product.  ", "2 \nreduce the domestic retail tariffs of the Bhutan Power Corporation (BPC), national transmission \nand distribution utility.6 The benefits from power exports are thus redistributed to domestic \nelectricity users through the regulatory tariff systems. However, electricity demand has been \ngrowing at around 10% per year since 2004, and is expected to double from 2013 to 2020. \nContinued hydropower development will be critical to contribute to export earnings and sustain \nthe  major  government  revenue,  while  keeping  affordable  electricity  prices  for  households, \nbusinesses, and industries. \n \n6.  Government initiatives. In the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2013\u20132018), the government \ndefines \u201cinclusive green socioeconomic development.\u201d7 It states that the green economy can be \ndriven by public and private investments that enhance economic growth while reducing carbon \nemissions, promoting efficient resource use, and increasing environmental quality and social \ninclusiveness. In developing hydropower projects, the plan requires optimizing approaches to \nenhance  local  development,  private  sector  participation,  employment  opportunities,  and \nalignment of the project\u2019s corporate social responsibilities with local community needs. The \ngovernment intends to use hydropower to promote inclusive development rather than simply \ngenerate electricity and revenue.   \n \n7.  ADB interventions. The Green Power Development Project supported the Dagachhu \nhydropower  plant  and  the  rural  electrification  program.  The  Dagachhu  plant,  completed  in \nAugust 2014, was developed through the first PPP for infrastructure in the country. To export \npower to India, a project special purpose company was established between the state-owned \ngeneration company, Druk Green Power Corporation (DGPC) and an Indian private partner, \nTata Power Company.8 Its subsidiary, Tata Power Trading Company, is an offtaker for the \nplant\u2019s electricity. The project was registered as the world\u2019s first cross-border CDM project. \nBhutan\u2019s clean power exports will foster regionwide climate change and economic cooperation.9 \nThe rural electrification programs have been supported by a series of ADB projects since 1995. \nThe assistance has been sequenced to maintain continuity and take into account lessons from \nprevious operations. ADB is a major contributor to the government\u2019s 100% electrification target \nby enabling electricity access of more than 40% of rural households.  \n \n8.  ADB also helped the government formulate the Sustainable Hydropower Development \nPolicy (2008), which enables private participation and foreign direct investment in hydropower \ndevelopment. While the government has focused on bilateral projects with the Government of \nIndia for additional 10,000 MW capacity,10 it intends to diversify through PPP and independent \npower  producers.11 Hydropower  development  and  energy  trade  are  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2014\u20132018 for Bhutan.12  \n     \n                                                \n6  Based on the concept of an energy royalty, 15% of the power generated in Bhutan is given free to the government \nand sold from the government to BPC at regulated discount prices. As a result, electricity is supplied to domestic \nconsumers at affordable tariffs, which are substantially cross-subsidized by power exports with higher prices. \n7  Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2013. Eleventh Five Year Plan. Thimphu. \n8  The project\u2019s shares are held by DGPC (59%), the National Pension and Provident Fund of Bhutan (15%), and \nTata Power Company (26%).  \n9  Bhutan\u2019s power supply is not merely a domestic issue but also a regional matter of using untapped clean energy \nresources; Bhutan will require a larger power supply market rather than its small domestic market. \n10  Based on the two governments\u2019 agreement, three projects are under construction: Punatsangchhu I (1,200 MW), \nPunatsangchhu II (1,020 MW), and Mangdechhu (720 MW), which are expected to be commissioned during 2017\u2013\n2018. Other projects are at various stages of preparation with the Indian government and its own enterprises.  \n11  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Promoting Clean Energy Development in Bhutan. \nManila. The prefeasibility and subsequent bid process is being supported to develop hydropower projects with PPP \nand/or independent power producers. \n12  ADB. 2014. Country Partnership Strategy: Bhutan, 2014\u20132018. Manila. \n ", "3 \n9.  Lessons.  In  2013,  ADB  provided  additional  financing  to  complete  the  Dagachhu \nhydropower development, which resulted in a cost overrun of about 17%.13 This was mainly \nbecause underground tunneling excavations required extra reinforcement due to unexpected \npoor geological conditions, which raised the cost of civil works over time. The civil work costs \nwere also increased by large escalations in labor and material prices. Considering Dagachhu\u2019s \nexperience,  appropriate  contingency  and  implementation  schedules  are  considered  for  the \nNikachhu hydropower plant. \n \n10.  Specific features. Since 2010, in preparing the project, DGPC has conducted extensive \ngeological investigations that found 80% of rock conditions tested to be in good order. The \nproject site and design were determined among the alternatives based on social, environmental, \ngeological, topographical, and hydrological assessments.14 DGPC incorporated THyE as the \nproject special purpose company. DGPC intends to dilute 26% of THyE to a private joint venture \npartner through an international competitive bidding process.15 The offtaker has already been \nselected through a bidding process (para 18).16 The project is proposed to be cofinanced with \nIndian commercial banks with Indian rupee terms as the first foreign commercial borrowing \nwithout  government  credit  support  for  Bhutan\u2019s  power  sector.  This  arrangement  will  help \nmitigate the currency risk exposure.17 It will also open a gateway to mix public sector finance \nwith commercial project finance, which can be applied to subsequent hydropower projects with \nhigh capital investments.18 To ensure inclusive social benefits and environmental conservation, \nthe  project  will  provide  skills  training  for  employment  and  income-generating  activities, \ncommunity development support, and environmental management plans. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The project\u2019s impact will be expanded cross-border power trading, and the outcome will \nbe increased clean hydropower generation in Bhutan.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n12.  The outputs will be (i) a 118 MW hydropower generation plant constructed, (ii) DGPC \nand THyE project management and implementation capacity enhanced, and (iii) hydropower \ndevelopment and trading framework improved.  \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n \n13.  The  project  cost  is  estimated  at  the  equivalent  of  $198.18  million  (Table  1).  The \nfinancing plan is summarized in Table 2.   \n                                                \n13  ADB. 2013.

The  TA  included  study  of  water  use  and  minimum \nenvironmental flow requirements for hydropower development using this project as a pilot case. Under the project \npreparatory TA, subbasin alternatives were further evaluated and the installed capacity was reduced from 210 MW \nto 118 MW for smaller safeguard impacts.  \n15  The bid criteria will be the up-front premium, the value of which can be increased after the project\u2019s financial \nclosure. DGPC is involved in the bid process to select the joint venture partner.  \n16  The project\u2019s levelized tariff over 25 years was more than 50% higher than the Dagachhu\u2019s original tariff.  \n17  The Bhutanese currency, the ngultrum is pegged with the Indian rupee in the exchange rate.  \n18  This will be the first foreign commercial term loan to DGPC without credit support from the government; it will help \nDGPC gain experience with more commercial funding. The Dagachhu project was financed in parallel by the \nAustrian export credit agency with the sovereign guarantee, and a local financial institution.  \n ", "4 \nTable 1: Investment Plan  \n($ million) \nItem  Amount \nA.

ADB  financing.  The government and DGPC have requested loans and a grant of \n$120.5 million to help finance the project. It will comprise (i) $50.5 million equivalent in various \nresources from Asian Development Fund (ADF) as a loan and a grant, each for $25.25 million; \nand (ii) $70.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR).19 The ADF loan will have a \n32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft financing and project agreements. The OCR loan will have a 30-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5.5 years, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,20 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft legal agreements.  \n \n15.  Cofinancing. A parallel loan to THyE is proposed for up to $58.82 million equivalent in \nIndian rupees from a syndication of Indian commercial banks to be led by the State Bank of \nIndia (SBI), using a project finance approach without sovereign guarantee. The loan will have a \nmaturity of 15 years including grace and moratorium periods of 5 years, and an interest rate and \nfees to be determined by the credit committee of each bank syndicated.21 SBI has already \nprovided its in-principle approval for its loan portion. ADB and SBI (representing the commercial \nbanks)  will  enter  into  a  separate  collaborative  cofinancing  arrangement  in  the  form  of  a \nmemorandum of understanding to ensure the application of ADB policies and guidelines on \nsafeguards, procurement, and anticorruption, and their related requirements.

The government will relend the \nADF grant and loan to DGPC, which will use the ADF resources for its equity to THyE. The OCR loan will be \ndirectly used for THyE\u2019s debt under the government\u2019s guarantee to ADB. \n20 The interest includes a maturity premium of 20 basis points given the borrowers\u2019 choice of repayment option. \n21 The pricing is proposed at the SBI base rate plus 225 basis points (i.e., current effective interest rate of 12.25%).  \n ", "5 \nhas requested a limited waiver of the negative pledge clause in (i) the financing agreement, and \n(ii) any existing and future loan and guarantee agreements between ADB and the government, \nsuch  that the  assets  of  THyE  are  not  considered government  assets for  purposes  of  the \nnegative pledge clause in such agreements.22 \n \nE.

Implementation and procurement. The project will be implemented over 5 years. After \nthe preparatory works for access roads and bridges, two procurement packages will be provided \nfor the main construction works: (i) civil works and hydromechanical equipment (part A) and (ii) \nelectromechanical  equipment  (part  B).  ADB  will  finance  both  packages,  following  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Since  the  cofinanciers\u2019 \nresources are commingled with ADF resources for part A, universal procurement applies to this \npackage. Since the OCR loan also finances the same package, a separate waiver of ADB\u2019s \nmember  country  procurement  eligibility  restrictions  is  requested  for  the  OCR  loan.  The \ngovernment,  DGPC,  and  THyE  have  requested  ADB for  advance  procurement  action  and \nretroactive financing for the project.  \n \n18.  Other arrangements. THyE has agreed to a power purchase agreement with Power \nTrading  Corporation  of  India.  The  25-year  agreement  follows  a  take-or-pay  arrangement, \nappropriate penalty clauses, and an offtake payment security mechanism. THyE also contracted \n                                                \n22 In line with project finance practice and in line with ADB\u2019s negative pledge requirements, THyE will grant equal and \nratable security over its assets for the commercial loan and the OCR loan. However, THyE will not grant security \nover its assets for the ADF loan since it is used as DGPC\u2019s equity contribution to THyE.  \n23 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "6 \nwith BPC to outsource supervision of the transmission line works. DGPC will disinvest THyE\u2019s \nminority share to bring private additional capital, expertise, and efficiency.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n19.  To strengthen the key sector frameworks and systems, the project will be supported by \ncapacity development TA for Acceleration of Hydropower Trading Development.24 The TA is \nestimated to cost $1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nSpecial Fund (TASF-V). It will strategically assess sector reforms for a functional segregation of \ndistribution and transmission, an independent system operator, and a separate power trading \nentity to aggregate power trading from Bhutan. It will also help improve the current hydropower \ndevelopment policy and finalize a draft tariff policy to address long-term sustainable tariff and \nsubsidy mechanisms. The TA will support project implementation by DGPC and THyE through \nequity  financing  from  a  joint  venture\u2019s  private  partner,  and  safeguard  strengthening  and \nmonitoring to assure project compliance. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n20.  DGPC conducted project prefeasibility studies including geological investigations. These \nwere upgraded to feasibility studies and a qualified and experienced engineering firm prepared \na detailed project report. The project preparatory TA consultant conducted comprehensive due \ndiligence studies, including extensive field and laboratory investigations such as hydrological, \ngeotechnical,  sedimentation,  mechanical,  and  electrical  requirements.  Most  of  the  project \nfacilities except the dam, access roads, and transmission lines will require underground works.25 \nThe project is designed to generate 491.5 gigawatt-hours at a very conservative level of 90% \ndependability.26 The plant is run-of-river, with a relatively small reservoir.27 The transmission line \nto evacuate power from the plant will be connected to a substation being constructed by the \nMangdechhu  Hydroelectric  Project  Authority.28 The  project  will  help  improve  power  supply \nreliability and efficiency in central and eastern Bhutan. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n21.  The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 17.31%.29 Assuming the project will \nsupply power to address India\u2019s energy deficit, the overall economic benefit to the Bhutan\u2013India \nsubregion is expected to be 21.70%. The project is financially viable with an expected financial \ninternal rate of return of 5.94% in real terms, higher than the weighted average cost of capital \n(1.84%). The  project  will  be  self-sustaining to meet  operating  expenses  and  debt  service, \nmaintaining the minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2.30 \n                                                \n24 Attached Technical Assistance (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25The  project\u2019s  accessibility  to  the  highway  and  a  substation  is  good;  access  roads  will  be  increased  by  \n16.5 kilometers (km) to help excavate a 12.2 km tunnel. The 132-kilovolt transmission line will be 18.6 km. \n26 More water is likely to be available for 90% of the operating time than designed with the hydrological data. An \nadditional 323.8 gigawatt-hours of energy will be generated in a cascaded manner at the run-of-river Mangdechhu \nhydroelectric project (720 MW) in the downstream main river, since water discharged from the Nikachhu plant will \nbe released into Mangdechhu reservoir. This additional output is not captured by THyE.  \n27 The gross reservoir capacity is relatively small at 0.537 million cubic meters of the 0.046 square kilometers (km2) of \nthe reservoir surface area. \n28 The authority was formed in 2010. Completion of the construction works is expected in 2017.  \n29 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n30 Financial Analysis; Currency Risk Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). The \nproject will fully service foreign debt of the OCR loan, which will cover 35% of the project cost, under the stress \n ", "7 \n22.  The analysis of the government\u2019s debt sustainability used methodology defined by the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Development Association.31 The public \ndebt to GDP ratio is high at 99.6%; a significant portion of the debt is related to the construction \nof several hydropower projects. In 2014, however, the IMF Article IV consultations concluded \nthat  Bhutan\u2019s  risk  of  debt  distress  was  moderate  because  of  mitigation  factors,  including \nBhutan\u2019s strong track record of project implementation, committed donor support, high amount \nof international reserves, strong energy demand from India, and the favorable financing terms of \nthe Indian government-funded hydropower projects.32 The IMF projects that the debt situation \nwould be turned around when ongoing large hydropower projects financed by the government of \nIndia are commissioned, and that debt ratios would improve as foreign exchange revenues from \nthe projects start flowing in 2017\u20132018 and onward with a beneficial impact on GDP, exports, \nand fiscal revenues. The debt ratios improve significantly when the Indian government-funded \nhydropower projects are excluded from the analysis by treating these loans as foreign direct \ninvestment, as suggested by the IMF. As a result, the ADB-financed projects would make no \nbreach of debt thresholds in the baseline.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n23.  DGPC and its subsidiaries have adopted comprehensive corporate policies and manuals \non accounting and financial management, inventory and procurement management, internal \naudit, human resources, and safeguards. These improvements are supported by management \ninformation systems provided through an enterprise resource planning system package. DGPC \nalso  follows  the  corporate  governance  code  developed  on  globally  accepted  corporate \ngovernance standards.33 The external independent auditor reported that these entities have \nadequate internal control systems, suitable budgetary control systems, adequate bidding, and \nsufficient organizational system control to carry out their operations in an orderly and efficient \nmanner.34 ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to  and \ndiscussed  with  the  government,  DGPC,  and  THyE.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n24.  Based  on  social  surveys  and  broad  consultations  with  local  community  members, \nincluding farmers and women groups, THyE devised a community development plan designed \nto share project benefits with communities. They include (i)  skill development training and \nlivelihood support, including a program for women\u2019s groups to learn commercial weaving in \ncollaboration  with  a  nongovernment  organization,  project-related  training  for  work,  and \ndevelopment of a sales outlet for the community to sell farming and woven products for income-\ngenerating activities; (ii) the creation of 2,250 jobs for construction works; (iii) infrastructure, \nincluding access roads and blacktopped farm roads to improve accessibility to education, social, \nand economic activities; and improved grid connection in communities to provide a more stable \nsupply of electricity; and (iv) school and health improvement by helping the community school \n                                                                                                                                                       \ntests assuming annual currency depreciation of (i) 3.5% from the past 10-year average currency depreciation and \n(ii) 7.0% from the purchasing power parity. THyE will adopt the foreign exchange fluctuation reserve, and the \npower purchase agreement has provision to sell partial power in foreign currency terms in case both parties \nmutually agree with its mechanism. THyE will be covenanted to have currency hedging or alternative arrangements \nto mitigate this risk, acceptable to ADB.  \n31 Debt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 India supported full project costs with a proportion of 30% grant and 70% loan. The first loan repayment is allowed \nonly when the project is commissioned, regardless of delays, to mitigate construction risks. The power export tariff \nwill be set on a cost plus basis to cover debt service and equity return to mitigate Bhutan\u2019s debt service risks.  \n33 Based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s corporate governance principles.  \n34 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nconstruct  an  additional  facility,  making  the  construction  camp  health  clinics  accessible  to \ncommunities, and improving community sanitation by supporting a garbage compactor truck and \nwaste disposal site.  \n \n25.  For the country, the project will help the promotion of inclusive growth. The energy \nroyalty will help sustain affordable electricity prices particularly for rural households, and power \nexports will generate additional government resources to promote socioeconomic development.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n26.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary  resettlement,  category  C  for \nindigenous peoples, and category A for environment. The safeguard documents are prepared \nas per ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) to guide land acquisition, compensation, and \nenvironmental mitigation measures.35 \n \n27.  Resettlement. No affected households will be physically displaced or relocated. The \nproject will not affect any physical structure (e.g., homesteads, shops, cattle sheds, outhouses, \nwater resources and irrigation channels, and religious and cultural structures). The construction \nof access roads will require the acquisition of 1.45 hectares of private land (dry land) from 12 \naffected households including a community primary school. An additional six households will be \naffected  by  the  transmission  tower  footprint  on  0.24  hectares  of  private  land.  In  total,  18 \nhouseholds comprising 84 persons will be affected; private land acquisition will be 1.69 hectares \nof 119.38 hectares for the total project area (including government land). No indigenous peoples \nare in the project-affected areas.  \n \n28.  Environment. More than half of Bhutan\u2019s territory is environmentally protected. The \nproject area lies in a narrow V-shaped valley. The dam site is almost vertical on the right bank \nand inaccessible to people and most wildlife. This bank will be inundated partly in the buffer \nzone  of  the  Jigme  Singye  Wangchuck  National  Park,36 while  the  other  park  area  will  be \nundisturbed. A muck disposal site will be used temporarily along the national highway in part of \na biological corridor, most of which is still available for wildlife movement between national \nparks.37 While  these  legally  protected  spots  are  treated  as  critical  habitat  as  per  ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement, the project area itself is not considered a critical habitat for any \nthreatened species supported by the park area. Based on the critical habitat assessments and \nsome  biodiversity  experts\u2019  advice,  it  is  considered  that  there  are  no  measurable  adverse \nimpacts on high biodiversity value and functionality, and the project is not anticipated to lead to \nany  reduction  in  their  population.  The  main  project  facilities  (e.g.,  tunnels,  underground \npowerhouse, camps, and transmission line) will be on the opposite bank of the park area, which \nhas already been degraded due to a national highway, cattle grazing, human settlements, and \ndeforested dry land. In aquatic habitats, no endangered or migratory fish have been recorded \ndue  to  a  series  of  waterfalls  in  the  downstream  of  the  Nikachhu  river.  The  minimum \nenvironmental flows will maintain at least 10% of the average lean seasonal flow, increasing to \n                                                \n35 EnvironmentImpactAssessment;ResettlementPlan (accessiblefromthelistof linked documents in Appendix 2). \n               \nThe environment impact assessment was disclosed on 4 August 2014 and the resettlement plan on 5 August 2014. \n36 The park covers an area of 1,723 km2. It currently has about 6,000 residents in 31 villages within park boundaries, \nand another 15,000 within the buffer zone, which is 1\u20135 km wide on the periphery of the park. The buffer zone is \nconsidered as a legally protected cushion from the core zone, which is strictly protected. A small part of the park\u2019s \nbuffer zone (0.024 km2) will be inundated behind a dam. It is a very small fraction of steep slope on the edge of the \nzone (20\u201330 meters wide x 800 meters long along the river) with 0.0014% of the park area. \n37 This biological corridor is already crossed by the national highway. Of the 5 km width area, 0.073 km2 will \ntemporarily be used for 1.5\u20132 years and revegetated rapidly afterward. Any construction activities in this area will \nbe disallowed at night time to avoid disrupting wildlife movements, most of which occur in the dark. Wildlife in the \narea will still have access to wide swaths of their habitat for refuge and movement. \n ", "9 \nmore than 20% in the downstream at the confluence of the main river of the Mangdechhu.38 The \nenvironmental flows will continue to be monitored and reassessed during implementation to \nensure the habitat requirements and integrated water resources management (IWRM) including \nrelevant controls for plant operations in the river basin.39 The project includes environmental \nmitigation  plans,  including  continued  surveys  with  internal  and  external  monitoring  and \nreporting.40  \n \n29.  Climate change. Climate change modeling analyses used eight climate models from \nvarious organizations. They project long-term water flow increases in the Nikachhu watershed, \nwhich should increase generation.41 The analyses show the project is hydrologically sound and \nits adaptation design (e.g., early warning systems) is effective. The project will have a positive \nclimate change impact under the CDM, eliminating 459,734 tons of potential carbon dioxide \nemissions that would otherwise be produced each year in India by use of fossil fuels to generate \nthe electricity equivalent to power export from Bhutan.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The overall project risk mitigations are adequately measured and incorporated. The \nintegrated benefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk \nmanagement plan.42  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nConstruction   Time and cost overruns are related to geological surprises and/or unexpected price escalation. \nDGPC\u2019s geological investigations over more than 3.5 years found 80% of rock tested to be in good \norder. To mitigate the overrun risks, the project includes adequate contingencies (22% of the base \ncost). Contractual mitigations are also in engineering, procurement, and construction arrangements. \nThe Dagachhu\u2019s experienced staff will support the project.    \nOperations  The plant\u2019s run-of-river hydropower operations are straightforward. THyE is staffed with experienced \n  management and individuals from DGPC, which operates five plants in Bhutan. A reputed joint \nventure partner will provide additional support. \nOfftake  A long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) was agreed with the largest power trader in India. \nThe offtaker\u2019s credit risk is further mitigated in the PPA by adequate payment security mechanism.  \nTransmission   The nearest substation under construction is expected to be available in 2017 for an ongoing \nproject. Once an 18.6 km transmission line is connected to this substation, the project\u2019s power can \nbe evacuated at least to the existing grid connections to India.  \nClimate  Climate  change  modeling  analyses  assess  the  Nikachhu  watershed  as  hydrologically  sound. \nchange   Adaptation measures against disasters are reflected in the design.  \nSafeguard   Extensive consultations and mitigation plans have been provided. The grievance redress committee \nwas formed and an independent panel of experts is to be established to ensure safeguard activities.  \nCurrency  Cofinancing in Indian rupees will reduce the currency mismatch risk between the revenue and debt \n                                                \n38 Twenty-nine major and minor perennial tributaries contribute to a significant increase of the downstream flows in \naround 10 km until the confluence with the Mangdechhu river; another 6\u20137 km downstream until the Mangdechhu \nplant\u2019s tailrace, the water flows will be increased to about 30% in the lean season as well. \n39 IWRM is provisioned in the Sustainable Hydropower Development Policy (2008) and the Water Act (2011). DGPC \nwill establish its funding mechanisms and/or internal resources to implement sustainable IWRM for the Nikachhu \nand Mangdechhu hydropower plant operations, along with the attached TA. Countrywide IWRM is being supported \nby ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Adapting to Climate Change through Integrated \nWater Resources Management. Manila. \n40 The environmental management plan includes biodiversity and wildlife conservation management, compensatory \nafforestation, and catchment area management, in collaboration with the national park, forestry offices, the \nbiodiversity management committee, the catchment management committee, and external specialists to be hired. \nThe attached TA will help implement the plan. The panel of experts will monitor safeguards and dam safety. DGPC \ndemonstrated satisfactory plan implementation and compliance under the Dagachhu development.  \n41 Climate Change Impact Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n42 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nservices.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n31.  The  government,  DGPC,  and  THyE  have  assured  ADB  that  implementation  of  the \nproject shall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption \nmeasures,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as \ndescribed in detail in the PAM and loan documents. The government, DGPC, and THyE have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and \nfinancing agreements, guarantee agreement, and project agreement. The effectiveness of these \nagreements is subject to a satisfactory subsidiary financing arrangement. Disbursement of ADB \nfunds is contingent upon a satisfactory power purchase agreement, the loan effectiveness of \nIndian commercial banks, and a cofinancing arrangement with Indian commercial banks.  \n \nVI.
