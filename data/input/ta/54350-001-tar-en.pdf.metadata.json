INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support capacity enhancement \nof the national statistical data (NSD) systems of selected developing member countries (DMCs) \nin Asia and the Pacific to produce high-quality statistical information using modern technology, \ninnovative data, advanced methods, and best practices. The Statistics and Data Innovation Unit \n(EROD-SDI) of the Economic Research and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) has \nundertaken capacity building initiatives in statistics, and this project, as one of those initiatives, \nsupports  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  through  technology-focused  capacity \nbuilding, in line with Strategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1 The project is aligned \nwith operational priority (OP) 6 of Strategy 2030 (strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity) as it will enhance the capacity of statistical systems to produce information needed for \nevidence-based policy making and program monitoring. Statistics produced in participating DMCs \nwill enable governments and ADB to track progress in alleviating poverty, in line with Strategy \n2030 OP1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing Inequalities). The project also supports \nOP7 of the strategy (fostering regional cooperation and integration) in that it will encourage \ncountry- and sector-specific participation in global statistical standards and methodologies. The \nTA is part of the approved workplan of ERCD and will enable ADB to expand its socioeconomic \ndatabases used for critical analysis.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  High-quality  data  that  can  be  transformed  and  analyzed  are  needed  to  deliver  the \nindicators in Strategy 2030 which can improve policy making, monitoring, and accountability of \nDMCs. In a globalized and digitalized world, relevant, accurate, timely, cross-cutting, readily \naccessible, and usable statistical information based on conventional and innovative data are \ncritical to analyzing local and global socioeconomic issues. The use of modern technology, \ncutting-edge methods, and innovative data can significantly improve the quality and usability of \nstatistics in, for example, formulating policies, and tracking progress toward development goals\u2014\nespecially the SDGs, which ADB recommends using to guide recovery from the coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19).3 \n \n3.  Although NSD systems in the target DMCs4 produce key socioeconomic indicators and \neven compile crucial data relevant to the SDGs, they have failed to adopt technological and \ntechnical innovations in the field of statistics and continue to compile statistics through outdated \nand/or costly means, which adversely affects the quality and timeliness of data. Furthermore, \ntraditional data-release and dissemination methods severely limit the accessibility and usability of \ndata. These shortcomings leave these NSD systems unable to provide critical and timely data. \nThe selection of the DMCs will vary and will be broadly based on the following criteria: the DMCs \n(i) will be conducting a census, survey, administrative, or nontraditional data; (ii) should have \nqualified staff who can be trained in statistics; and (iii) should be keen to incorporate modern tools \nand statistical innovations into their systems. \n \n \n1 ADB. 2018.

Use SDGs and Paris Agreement to Guide Recovery from COVID-19 - ADB VP. Bangkok. \n4 Target DMCs are those classified in group A (concessional assistance-only) and those in group B and C that have \nidentified the subject matter of this TA project as areas for further development in their respective NSD systems \n(https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/31483/om-a1.pdf). Furthermore, based on this criteria, \nEROD-SDI already have a tentative list\u2014e.g. Pacific countries. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  The TA project will focus on innovative approaches to producing key socioeconomic and \nSDG-relevant statistics in two domains: (i) data collection, management, and dissemination; and \n(ii) knowledge sharing on innovations in statistics.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMCs\u2019 capacity to produce, manage, and \nexchange  information  in  support  of  rigorous  evidence-based  policy  making  and  program \nmonitoring, particularly in relation to the SDGs, enhanced. The TA will have the following outcome: \nCapacity of DMCs\u2019 NSD systems to produce, manage, and disseminate high-quality, high-\nfrequency, and granular statistics on selected socioeconomic indicators strengthened. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n1.  Collection, management, and dissemination of data through innovative \ntechnology \n \n6.  Output 1: Developing member countries\u2019 statistical capacity in using computer-\nassisted personal interviewing, computer-assisted telephone interviewing, or computer-\nassisted web interviewing enhanced. Under this output, ADB will support at least two DMCs to \nfacilitate implementation of a survey based on computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), \ncomputer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), or computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI). \nThe national statistics office staff of the targeted DMCs will be trained in all aspects of these \nsurveys, including questionnaire design; programming on CAPI, CATI, or CAWI platforms; data \nvalidation; data transfer; and maintenance of relevant equipment or devices. Furthermore, training \nwill be provided on the use of software to collect data using tablets, telephones, and/or the web. \n \n7.  Output 2: Workshops on latest developments in the field of surveys conducted for \ndeveloping member countries. As the availability of high-speed internet expands in DMCs, so \ndoes the opportunity to pilot novel surveying techniques such as interactive voice response, short \nmessaging service (SMS) surveys, and opinion polling using social media. The TA will support \nADB staff and DMC officials and researchers to participate in workshops to promote knowledge \nsharing on technological innovation in surveying. \n \n8.  Output 3: Statistical data and metadata eXchange standards adopted by developing \nmember countries. The TA will support selected DMCs to implement statistical data and \nmetadata eXchange (SDMX)\u2014an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard \nto describe statistical data and metadata, normalize the exchange of such data, and promote \nefficient sharing of such data across organizations.  \n \n2.  Knowledge sharing on technological, technical, and data innovations in \nstatistics \n \n9.  Output  4:  Online  training  provided  to  developing  member  countries  on  using \ninformation and communication technology tools to improve collection and management \nof survey data. ADB in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \nNations launched two massive open online courses on CAPI that saw high enrollment in 2019 \nand 2020. Given the high demand from DMCs for skills in digitized surveys, the TA will support \nupdating these two massive open online courses to reflect the latest version of the software for \n ", "3 \nproviding  such  courses,  and  to  include  additional  modules  on  telephone,  interactive  voice \nresponse, SMS, and web interviewing. \n \n10.  Output 5: Online course on statistical data and metadata eXchange developed for \nthe developing member countries. ADB in collaboration with SDMX sponsor organizations will \ndevelop a free online course to train DMC officials and staff on modern data dissemination \naccording to the latest international standards. \n \n11.  Output 6: Developing member countries\u2019 participation in knowledge-sharing events \non statistics supported. Support provided to DMC researchers and ADB staff to participate in \ninternational conferences, seminars, and workshops on statistics and related subjects to enhance \ntheir technical and technological capacity and promote knowledge sharing on topical issues.5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6\u2014$445,000 and TASF-other sources\u2014$305,000). \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. ERCD, through EROD-SDI, will be the executing agency.
