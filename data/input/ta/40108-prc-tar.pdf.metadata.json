INTRODUCTION \n1.    During the 2006 Country Programming Midterm Review Mission, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  to  prepare  the  National  Strategy  for  Rural  Biomass  Renewable \nEnergy Development. ADB included the proposed TA in the 2006 PRC operational program, \nand the concept paper for this TA was approved by the Vice President on 26 April 2006.    \n \n2.   At the request of the Government, ADB fielded the Fact-Finding Mission in Beijing on \n19\u201328 April 2006, and held discussions with officials from the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), \nwhich will be the Executing Agency, and the concerned ministries.1 During the discussions, the \nTA\u2019s objective, outcomes, outputs and activities, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, \nand  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  were  confirmed.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.   Traditionally utilized biomass (e.g., either burned directly or in low-efficiency stoves) is \nstill the dominant energy source in rural areas. In 2003, 50% of the rural population (about 400 \nmillion  farmers)  still  relied  on  the  direct  combustion  of  wood  and  agricultural  residues  for \ncooking and heating. The use of these biomass fuels causes serious air pollution and health \nrisks, and overexploitation of biomass resources has also caused significant environmental \ndamage including erosion, deforestation, biodiversity reduction, and damage to watersheds.  \n \n4.     Animal  wastes  from  rapidly  expanding  household  livestock  breeding  activities  and \nlivestock farming regularly introduce massive quantities of non-point source pollutants to the \nwaterways, contributing to deteriorating water quality. Based on estimates from ADB TA 3891-\nPRC2 in 2001, the rural chemical oxygen demand load was 1.42 times the load from industry \nand urban sewage discharges. According to this study, by 2020 the rate of livestock production \nis expected to have increased by 167% from 2000 levels. A 40% reduction in rural nonpoint \nsource pollution by 2020 will be needed just to stabilize pollution at its current high levels, and \nposes a considerable challenge to livestock producers. \n \n5.     Rural biomass renewable energy (BRE) is a sensible and cost-effective way to address \nboth rural energy gaps and the rural non-point source pollution problem. BRE is created using \nanimal wastes and crop residues, and is produced with solar energy (through photosynthesis), \ncreating carbon-hydrates from carbon dioxide and water. BRE products used in the PRC include \nbiogas, gases from straw and stalk gasification, electricity from biomass power generation, and \nvarious solid and liquid biofuels. BRE systems can be affordably established at both household \nand livestock farm scales, use readily available agricultural wastes, have few recurrent costs, \nneed no highly specialized skills, and have high potential for extra revenues through Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM) because of the potential for greenhouse gas reduction.  \n                                                 \n1 The Mission held meetings with officials from (i) the MOA, including the rural energy division, rural energy institute \nand foreign economic cooperation center; (ii) the Ministry of Finance (MOF), including the international and \nagriculture departments; (iii) the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, \ninternational cooperation and social mobilization department; (iv) the State Environmental Protection Administration \n(SEPA), including the nature and ecology conservation department and the international cooperation department; \nand (v) the National Development and Reform Committee (NDRC), agriculture economy department and energy \nbureau.   \n2  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study on Control and Management of \nRural Nonpoint Source Pollution. Manila (TA 3891-PRC), completed in November 2004. Nonpoint source pollutants \ninclude chemical oxygen demand, total nitrogen and total phosphate; the report estimates rural discharge levels of \nthese pollutants across the PRC in 2001 at 19.95, 11.54 and 3.33 million tons, respectively \n ", "2   \n \n6.    Recent Government actions have strongly supported an enhanced national focus on \nBRE development. Rural BRE development is an important element in the Number 1 Policy \nDocument Decision on New Socialism Countryside Development, promulgated by the Central \nCommittee  of  the  Communist  Party  on  21  February  2006.  The  new  socialism  countryside \ndevelopment policy will promote (i) advanced farm production methods, (ii) improved livelihood, \n(iii) a civilized social atmosphere, (iv) clean and tidy villages, and (v) democratic management. \nThe  first,  second,  and  fourth  areas  will  benefit  from  BRE  development.  Additionally,  the \nRenewable Energy Law, ratified by the National People\u2019s Congress in 2005, has been effective \nsince  January  2006.  This  law  supports  biomass  electricity  generation  by  requiring  the \ncompanies distributing electricity via the power grid to purchase biomass-generated electric \npower at a 0.25 yuan per kilowatt-hour premium. Finally, SEPA, as the national environmental \nadministrative authority, is tightening wastewater treatment requirements for livestock farms, \nsetting up strict discharge standards, and promulgating environmental management regulations. \nThese policies range from command and control measures to economic incentives, but share a \ncommon goal of stimulating BRE development in rural areas.  \n \n7.   The newly formulated National Renewable Energy Plan and Long-term Perspective (the \nPlan) highlights the importance of further BRE development. The Plan includes the following \nBRE development targets, to be achieved by 2020: (i) to have 80 million household biogas \ndigesters in use (about 17 million now exist, with 63 million digesters to be constructed); (ii) \nincreased electricity production through the development of 10,000 biogas power stations (there \nare currently about 700); (iii) construction of 15,000 straw and stalk gasifiers (there are currently \nabout 520 gasification stations); and (iv) annual production of 5,000 tonnes of liquid biofuels. \n \n8.   There are substantial barriers to achieving these targets. These barriers include the \naffordability to the poor3, the economic incentives for the external investors to participate, and \nthe absence of a cohesive and integrated national strategy. Particularly, the absence of a \ncohesive national strategy has led to further difficulties in developing rural BRE. First, there is a \nmismatch between resource supply and BRE demand. Following the release of the Decision on \nNew Socialism Countryside Development and the approval of the 11th Five Year Plan (FYP), all \nprovinces discussed their respective options for developing and using BRE. Biomass is not only \nused for energy purposes, however, but is also an important ecological material, serving as a \nfertilizer in rural areas. As BRE development increases, sustainability of this resource must be \nensured, through attention to the carbon cycle, and to water, key nutrients, and biodiversity. \nSecond,  there  is  a  risk  that  biogas  system  operations  will  fail.  The  lack  of  coordinated \ninstitutional arrangements results in different agencies promoting technologies through different \nfinancial sources. Insufficient technical support services and poor maintenance will shorten the \nlife of a biogas system, and there is evidence that 50% of established biogas systems in some \ncities  have  stopped  operating.  Third,  large-scale  power  generators  have  limitations  under \ncurrent situation. The Renewable Energy Law favors the establishment of large-scale BRE \npower generators, but without appropriate incentives for collection and transport of biomass \nresources by farmers, the radius within which collection of biomass resources is cost-effective \nwill become a bottleneck for large-scale plant operation. Fourth, without sufficient guidance, \nlocal BRE development has been ineffective. An understanding of local resource availability, \nand the economic characteristics and diversity of BRE compared with other competing fuels, is \nrequired if BRE development is to be effective under local conditions. For example, biomass \ngasification technology needs to be developed with cost-effective tar removal systems. Biogas \nplants  should  recover  waste  heat  from  the  exhaust  of  engines  used  for  biogas  electricity \n                                                 \n3 The subsidy program begun in 2003 remains an important incentive, but is not sufficient to make BRE systems \naffordable for many of the rural poor. Additionally, the existing productive capacity of poor farmers may be too \nlimited to ensure effective use of a household biogas system. ", "  3\ngeneration.  Improving  the  operational  performance  of  biogas  plants  in  the  country\u2019s  cold \nnorthern climate is a persistent problem. The utilization of digestion liquids as fertilizers and the \npromotion of eco-farming production through BRE development were also not well addressed in \nthe existing regulatory framework. \n \n9.     Protecting environment and promoting clean energy is one of the strategic areas in the \nPRC  2006\u20132008  country  strategy  and  program  update4.  Since  early  2001,  ADB  and  the \nGovernment have been working together on rural BRE development through Loan 1924-PRC.5 \nIn response to the success of this pilot project, the Government requested (i) TA to develop a \ncomprehensive strategy and implementation plan for rural BRE development, which can form \nthe basis for discussions regarding a strategic partnership between ADB and the PRC on BRE \ndevelopment; and (ii) a specific investment to replicate and upscale the pilot project experience \nto other provinces, including consideration of medium- and large-scale biogas development.6 \nThis effort will benefit rural populations by improving living standards and addressing non-point \nsource pollution.  \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.   The impact of the TA will be an improved rural environment, increased rural household \nincome, and an ensured rural energy supply. The expected outcome will be promotion of the \nuse of affordable, environmentally sound, and sustainable BRE through a set of policy and \nrelated implementation recommendations, covering institutional, financial and technical aspects, \nat the national, provincial, and local levels. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.   The main outputs of the TA will be (i) a national strategy (short term and long term, \ncovering  2006\u20132020)  for  BRE  development  in  the  PRC,  and  (ii)  a  partnership  framework \nbetween the Government and ADB on BRE development.   \n \n12.   The TA will support the following interrelated activities.  \n \n(i)  Preparation of a technical roadmap for BRE development on a regional basis, by: (a) \ndividing the country into appropriate regions, considering resource distribution features, \neconomic  characteristics  and  BRE  diversity;  (b)  surveying  biomass  types,  resource \navailability, and distribution in the regions (including provinces, counties and villages); (c) \nevaluating the demand of biomass renewable energy in the regions; (d) surveying and \nselecting suitable BRE development technologies; (e) evaluating the constraints and \nopportunities for BRE development in the regions; (f) identifying the suitability of, and \ntechnology  pathways  needed  to  establish  a  roadmap  for  BRE  development  in  the \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2005.

Report and Recommendation of the President on a Proposed Loan to the People\u2019s Republic of China \nfor the Efficient Utilization of Agricultural Wastes Project. Manila (Loan 1924-PRC). The loan in the amount of \n$33.12 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR) was approved on 22 October 2002. It aims at \nimproving the environment and promoting economic growth to improve the welfare and living conditions of rural \nhouseholds in the provinces of Henan, Jiangxi, Hubei and Shanxi by generating cleaner and sustainable biogas \nenergy and increasing agricultural productivity through efficient utilization of agricultural wastes.  \n6  The ADB 2006 Country Programming Midterm Review Mission agreed with the Government to include a 2007 \nproject preparatory TA, entitled Rural Renewable Energy Development and Ecological Agriculture.    \n \n ", "4   \nselected  provinces;  and  (g)  identifying  and  recommending  future  research  and \ndevelopment needs of BRE technologies. \n(ii)  Development of an institutional and policy assessment for BRE development, by: (a) \nanalyzing  the  policy  and  institutional  barriers  that  exist  to  BRE  development;  (b) \nrecommending institutional arrangements, including coordination mechanisms for BRE \ndevelopment; (c) establishing incentive instruments to improve BRE affordability to poor \nfarmers,  reduce  rural  nonpoint  source  pollution,  and  increase  public\u2013private \npartnerships;  (d)  establishing  a  platform  for  information  exchange  between  all \nstakeholders involved in BRE development; and (e) providing international experiences \nto improve institutional capacity and inter-ministerial cooperation.  \n(iii)  Preparation of an investment needs assessment and financing plan recommendations, \nby: (a) analyzing investment needs for achieving long-term BRE development objectives; \n(b)  advising  on  measures  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  the  investment  program, \nincluding domestic bonds projects; (c) designing a financing plan, including domestic \nsources and external assistance; (d) designing strategies for attracting external financing \n(from lenders such as the World Bank and ADB, from bilateral funding agencies, and \nthrough private sector participation, and by investigating the applicability of CDM and \nGlobal  Environmental  Facility  (GEF),  covering  appropriate  financial  methods  and \nmechanisms and the possible integration of external sources with domestic bonds; (iv) \nformulating strategic options for rural BRE development; and (v) identifying where it is \nappropriate to utilize ADB assistance for rural BRE development.  \n \n13.   Based on the TA findings, the TA will draft a national strategy with recommendations for \nshort- and long-term BRE development strategic options, covering 2006\u20132020. The strategy will \ninclude recommendations regarding institutional arrangements, a technical roadmap, a set of \neconomic instruments to increase affordability, measures for reducing rural nonpoint source \npollution and promoting public\u2013private partnerships, an investment program, and a financing \nplan. The executive summary will be submitted to the State Council for consideration.  \n \n14.   The TA will prepare a partnership framework between the PRC and ADB on rural BRE \ndevelopment, which will be submitted to MOF and NDRC for consideration. The partnership \nframework will delineate how partnership with ADB can assist the PRC in implementing those \naspects of the country\u2019s New Socialism Countryside Development policy that relate to rural BRE \npromotion, and will address (i) where ADB assistance can be most effectively utilized; (ii) \nfinancial  approaches;  (iii)  assistance  mechanisms;  (iv)  coordination  and  cooperation  with \ndomestic bonds, the World Bank, and bilateral aid agencies; and (v) cofinancing by GEF; and \nCDM applicability.  \n \n15.   The TA will emphasize coordination and cooperation with concerned line ministries and \nstakeholders. A steering committee will be established, chaired by the vice minister of MOA and \nincluding senior officials of ministries concerned. An aid coordination mechanism will be formed \nfor sharing information and exchanging experience.  \n \n16.    Three  workshops  will  be  held  to  discuss  strategy  design,  solicit  comments  on  the \nroadmap and strategy, and reach consensus among key stakeholders. The first workshop will \ndiscuss the methodology and strategy development activities. The second workshop will discuss \nthe draft strategy and partnership framework. The third workshop will assess the outcomes of \nthe TA, and discuss the follow-up steps to continue partnerships after the TA is complete.  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA cost is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $400,000 on a grant \nbasis through its TA funding program. The Government will finance the remaining $200,000 \nequivalent. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n18.   This TA will closely coordinate with the ADB\u2019s ongoing L1924-PRC Efficient Utilization of \nAgriculture Wastes Project and the project preparatory TA (2007) for the proposed lending on \nRural Renewable Energy and Ecological Agriculture. All of the activities will provide a solid basis \nfor TA implementation. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  The MOA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. A steering committee chaired by the \nvice minister of MOA will be established, comprising a senior official from NDRC, MOF, the \nMinistry of Science and Technology (MOST), SEPA and the State Council Leading Group Office \nof Poverty Alleviation and Development. The steering committee will provide overall guidance \non the TA\u2019s direction. The steering committee members will meet at and provide guidance \nthrough the three TA workshops.  \n \n20.  A TA management office (TMO) will be established in the Rural Energy Division (RED) \nof MOA to carry out day-to-day TA operations. The RED director will serve as the head of the \nTMO and function as the overall TA coordinator. The Foreign Economic Cooperation Center, \nRural  Energy  and  Environment  Institute  (REI)  and  RED  will  work  closely  and  be  jointly \nresponsible for day-to-day communications and operational matters among ADB, consultants, \nand related government agencies.  \n \n21.
