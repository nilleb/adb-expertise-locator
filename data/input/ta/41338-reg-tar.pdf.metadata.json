INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional research and development technical assistance project was included in the \n2007  technical  assistance  (TA)  program  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment (RSDD) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to undertake analytical work and \nsupport project formulation on issues related to the environmental management of cities and to \nsupport sustainable urban development in Asia.1 The TA is still included in the 2009 TA \nprogram of RSDD. Urban environmental infrastructure is a high priority under ADB\u2019s long-term \nstrategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020)2 and an important issue for developing member \ncountries (DMCs). The public sector cannot meet the need alone. A closer partnership between \nthe public and private sectors is thus essential. ADB can play a key role in helping to finance \nthis need and foster partnerships between the public and private sectors. In addressing these \nissues, this TA responds to both the demands of DMCs and the operational needs of ADB. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  Urban economies play a central role in Asia\u2019s economic growth and development. \nUnder ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,  ADB is committed to making Asia\u2019s cities more livable. Crucial to \nthis task is improving the urban environment. Infrastructure should be designed to mitigate \nenvironmental  impacts  through  reduced  waste  generation  and  resource  use  to  foster \nsustainability and an improved environment. The design of infrastructure determines patterns of \nresource use and waste generation for decades. It is thus essential that these designs be \nappropriate for a sustainable future. In line with this, regional and national institutions are \nrequired to improve the efficiency of current patterns of resource use. This may be done by \napplying the reduce, reuse, and recycle (3R) principles set out under the global 3R Initiative, \nwhich was agreed at the Sea Island Summit 2004 following on a proposal from the Government \nof Japan.3 ADB has contributed to the initiative, through, for instance, publishing the report \nToward Resource Efficient Economies in Asia and the Pacific with the Institute for Global \nEnvironmental Strategies (IGES) and presenting it as an input to the Group of Eight summit in \n2008.4  It  has  become apparent  that  DMCs  regard  investing  in infrastructure  to  conserve \nresources and minimize waste generation as vital to improving the resource efficiency and \nsustainability of their economies.   \n \n3.  Country experience in implementing the initiative has been extensive. In Viet Nam, the \nProject for Implementation Support for 3R Initiative in Hanoi City has been implemented with \nthe Hanoi Urban Environment Company and the Hanoi Women\u2019s Union Project. Its purpose is \nto prepare a harmonized 3R system based on a program of separating organic waste at the \nsource throughout Hanoi. In the Philippines, the project for establishing an ecological solid \nwaste\u2013management system in three cities has been implemented in collaboration with the \nGovernment of the Philippines. In the People\u2019s Republic of China, the project for promoting a \nrecycling economy has been implemented from the perspective of environmental protection \nand strengthening the capacity of major players at each step in material recycling. In Indonesia, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 July 2007. \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n3  The Group of Eight\u2019s See Island Summit in 2004 formally recognized the necessity of improving country\u2019s resource \nproductivity and working toward constructing an environmentally sound international society through the 3R \nInitiative. The initiative has been reaffirmed at subsequent Group of Eight summits. \n4  The preparation of the report was part of ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Promoting Environment Investment \nin Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA 6292-REG). \n ", "2  \nthe  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  preparing  in  2009  a  technical  cooperation \nproject to develop capacity in 3R promotion and domestic solid waste management with the \nMinistry of Environment and the Ministry of Public Works. In the Fiji Islands, Japan International \nCooperation Agency has initiated the Waste Reduction/Recycling Promotion Project with the \nDepartment of Environment in 2008. \n \n4.  This TA responds to both the demands of DMCs for the provision of sustainable city \ninfrastructure and the regional need to develop investment models adapting 3R principles to \nspecific  circumstances  in  each  participating  DMC.  Recently,  countries  and  development \npartners under the regional 3R Initiative, including ADB, agreed to establish a 3R regional \nforum aiming to promote policy dialogues and the implementation of 3R-oriented projects. This \nTA will enable ADB to support DMCs\u2019 investment in such sectors as solid waste management, \nenergy efficiency, and waste water treatment. However, such projects have been difficult to \npackage, often requiring coordination across local government agencies. The TA will provide \nresources to address these issues prior to detailed project preparation and financing. \n \n5.  Such objectives are completely in line with ADB's Strategy 2020 (footnote 2). Strategy \n2020 sets out clear areas of focus in urban infrastructure related to climate change and livable \ncities  and  encourages  partnering  with  other  agencies.  These  objectives  are  met  in  many \nsubsectors of urban infrastructure through policies fostered under the 3R Initiative. In addition, \nthe initiative will enable ADB to increase the quantity and improve the quality of its urban \nlending based on the principles of sustainability. To this end, the TA will assist in project \nformulation for 3R projects, leverage cofinancing for longer-term programmatic interventions \nand thereby expand pipelines, and bolster urban sector knowledge and sector analysis, thereby \nimproving project quality. It will support urban networking and outreach in 3R. \n \n6.  Through the TA, ADB has the opportunity to partner strongly with the private sector and \nbilateral  donors.  For  example,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  and  German \ndevelopment cooperation through GTZ are participating in the 3R Initiative, supporting DMCs in \ncapacity and institutional development and making some bilateral investments. The United \nNations Center for Regional Development and the United Nations Environment Programme \nparticipate  in  the  3R  Initiative  and  assist  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Philippines, \nThailand, and Viet Nam in developing 3R national strategies, with support from ADB and the \nMinistry of the Environment, Japan. Coordination with such organizations will be done through \nnetworking under the 3R regional forum.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  This TA is one of a number of ADB responses to urbanization issues in Asia. The project \nfollows on from the Managing the Cities in Asia TA,5 which proposed a number of responses to \nthe issues raised in the Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations.6 \nThese were (i) more effective support for ADB\u2019s urban operations departments7 and the urban \ncommunity of practice (urban CoP) and (ii) more effective partnerships. The current TA will \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Managing the Cities in Asia. Manila (TA 6293-REG, approved on 19 \nDecember). \n6  ADB. 2006. Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations. Manila. This rated the Urban \nSector Strategy as relevant and effective but only partly efficient and less sustainable, mainly because of staffing \nand lending modality constraints on ADB urban operations. \n7  ADB\u2019s regional departments and the Private Sector Operations Department. \n ", "     \n    3 \n         \n     \nsupport the formulation of projects that respond to these issues. \n \n8.  Thus,  in  the  context  of  Strategy  2020,  this  TA  will  contribute  to  the  improved \nmanagement of urban development in DMCs to achieve livable cities that are environmentally \nsustainable. It will foster new forms of project formulation and administration and increase \nsupport for operations departments\u2019 urban operations.  \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA will be increased investment in urban infrastructure to meet the \nneeds of urban residents, providing better service with reduced adverse environmental impacts, \nand  an  increase  in  the  sustainability  of  cities  by  incorporating  3R  principles  in  waste \nmanagement and other urban infrastructure investment.  \n  \n10.  To achieve these outcomes, the main activities of the TA are to (i) prepare projects \nand/or programs financeable by ADB for selected cities in the target countries that incorporate \n3R principles in urban management and (ii) collect, process, manage, and disseminate the \nknowledge captured in project formulation and other relevant activities under the 3R regional \nforum.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The two components of the project are as follows: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Project formulation. RSDD will make a pool of funds available \nto operations departments for formulating projects and/or programs financeable \nby ADB for selected cities that incorporate 3R principles in waste management, \nurban  transport,  urban  subsovereign  finance,  and  urban  economic  (cluster) \ndevelopment. The projects and/or programs will be identified and prioritized n \nclose collaboration with operations departments based on the outputs of the \nknowledge  activities  of  the  urban  CoP,  relevant  project  identification  by \noperations departments, and inputs from the 3R regional forum.  Once projects \nand/or programs are selected, suitable consultants will be engaged for each to \nmeet  their  specific  needs.  These  consultants  will  be  engaged  by  RSDD  in \nconsultation with operations departments. RSDD will manage the consultants in \nclose collaboration with the clients and operations departments as they conduct \npre-feasibility studies and initial implementation activities, etc. The urban CoP \nwill have a key role in providing guidance to consultants. Priority will be given to \npublic-private partnership projects. A local consultant will be engaged to help \nRSDD to manage TA activities. \n \n(ii)  Component  2:  Regional  knowledge  sharing.  RSDD  will  collect,  process, \nmanage, and disseminate the knowledge captured in component 1 and other \nactivities under the 3R regional forum. Consultants will be engaged to assist \nRSDD  in  these  activities.  Institutions  already  engaged  in  the  3R  Initiative \nthrough the 3R knowledge hub\u2014jointly hosted by Asian Institute Technology \n(AIT) and the United Nations Environment Programme and established under \nTA for the Establishment of Regional Knowledge Hubs8\u2014will be engaged for \nspecific studies. A particular focus of this component will be on adapting the \n                                                 \n8  ADB.  2005.  Technical  Assistance  for  Establishment  of  Regional  Knowledge  Hubs.  Manila  (TA  6295-REG, \napproved on 21 December).  \n ", "4  \nvarious  models  of  3R  investments  for  city  development  to  the  specific \ncircumstances of participating in DMCs. Analytical studies will be selectively \nconducted regionally, subregionally, or nationally in collaboration with partners in \nthe 3R regional forum. To disseminate the knowledge to and through operations \ndepartments, the urban CoP will participate in and selectively initiate various \nevents such as workshops, seminars, and meetings of the 3R regional forum. \nThis component will provide the urban CoP with resources to better manage \nknowledge in respect of 3R in ADB. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $2,000,000. The TA will be financed as a grant by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The TA cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, with its RSDD as the nodal department for \nimplementation. RSDD will undertake TA activities in collaboration with relevant operations \ndepartments. A no-objection letter from the relevant DMCs will be obtained before commencing \nany activities in the territory of said DMC. The TA implementation team will comprise a team \nleader from RSDD supported by a subcommittee of the urban CoP. Implementation will take \nplace over 24 months from December 2009. For both components, ADB will engage consultants \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n14.  Implementing  component  1  of  the  TA  will  require  about  40  person-months  of \ninternational consultancy and 60 person-months of national consultancy, contracted using the \nconsultants\u2019 qualification selection or single source selection, as appropriate.9 This modality is \nappropriate as the projects in this component are to be chosen during implementation through \nconsultation between the urban CoP and governments. As such, flexibility in team formation is \nrequired.  The  projects  will  typically  be  undertaken  by  small  teams  of  consultants  highly \nspecialized  in  the  sector  and  country.  The  project  formulation  consultants  will  undertake \ntechnical studies and specialized analytical studies under the guidance of the urban CoP and \nthe supervision of operations departments. Operations departments will use the established \none-page application format for urban CoP support, to be approved at monthly meetings. The \nterms  of  reference  and  project  formulation  milestones  will  be  determined  by  operations \ndepartment supervising offices. \n \n15.  Implementing component 2 of the TA will require two streams: technical inputs to the \ninitiative and the operation of the knowledge hub. The first stream of technical inputs will require \nabout  6  person-months  of  international  consultancy  and  20  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy.  It  is  proposed  that  IGES  be  contracted  on  a  single-source  basis  to  provide \nspecialized analytical inputs related to 3R, as it has been the core institution providing technical \ninputs to the 3R Initiative in the past and is currently the focal point for research under the 3R \n                                                 \n9  Consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method may be used for small assignments where highly specialized expertise \nis required for the assignment and recruitment of \u201cboutique\u201d consulting firms that provide depth of expertise in \nspecific areas is contemplated. Single source selection, indicatively, half will be by cost and quality selection, which \nis the preferred method if the assignment requires joint efforts from various experts. Where a competitive tender \namong firms qualified for the assignment is not possible, the consultants will be engaged through individual \nconsultant selection. \n ", "     \n    5 \n         \n     \n3R regional forum. IGES is proposed as the implementing agency for this component of the TA \nfor the following reasons: \n \n(i)  IGES is an established leader in research and policy development in the 3R field \nand strongly supported by the Government of Japan as an environmental think \ntank, providing expert analysis and advice on all aspects of long- and short-term \ngovernment policies and practice in the 3R field. \n \n(ii)  It  has  significant  experience  in  establishing  3R  networks  and  organizing \ninternational fora. In particular, IGES provides support to the development of the \n3R regional forum, including working with DMCs such as Viet Nam to prepare \nand implement 3R policies, including methodologies and systems.   \n \n(iii)  IGES has been actively engaged in capacity development and the dissemination \nof knowledge related to 3R.  It has organized many workshops, conferences, and \nseminars and has a network for this with many organizations and professionals in \nDMCs. It is therefore in a better position to address the need to attract the \nparticipatory sharing of experiences from other countries through the 3R regional \nforum. \n \n16.  The second stream will require approximately 18 months of national consultancy and \nsupport  to  develop  knowledge  systems  and  capacity  development  toward  operating  the \nknowledge hub. IGES will focus on the research and knowledge development aspects of this \nstream and AIT will focus on the development of knowledge dissemination systems through \ntheir existing 3R knowledge hub. Thus, it is also proposed that AIT be contracted on a single-\nsource basis to provide knowledge hub services. AIT has been the knowledge hub for the 3R \nInitiative since July 2006 and has performed this task well to date. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 on a grant basis for Project Preparation Support for \nLivable Cities in Asia. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved management of  The infrastructure, service  Urban sector and sector  Greater commitment by \ncities of all sizes in  delivery, and  and/or thematic reports of  stakeholders and policymakers \ndeveloping member  environmental parameters  DMC governments and  in DMCs to improve \ncountries (DMCs)  in these cities, along with  international organizations  management of cities \nfinancial management of   \nmunicipalities   \n   \nAchievement of  Asian Development Bank  Improved knowledge and policy \nMillennium Development  (ADB) and international  dialogue translates into \nGoals (MDGs), in  progress reports on MDGs  improved management of cities. \nparticular to improve the     \nlives of at least 100 million \nslum dwellers by 2020 \n(target 4 of MDG 7)\nOutcome  Assumptions \nImproved operational  Better sector  DMC reports and ADB  Continued interest of DMC \nknowledge and  diagnostics and project  CPSs and programs  policy makers and stakeholders \nmanagement in Asian  development processes    in improving management of \ncities      cities \n     \n  Demand for ADB  CPSs and DMC feedback  Effective engagement of key \n  assistance related to  received through various  regional experts in this \n  management and  formal and informal channels  analytical work \n  development of cities   \n      Increased demand for ADB \n  Inputs to CPSs based on  Project processing  assistance to manage and \nImprovement in ADB\u2019s  ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with  information systems  develop cities \npolicy dialogue, relevance,  DMCs  and CPSs   \nand responsiveness to the   \ndemands of Asian DMCs   \n  Urban financing \npartnership facility \nEnhancement of ADB\u2019s \ndesigned  \nability to resource these \n \nimprovements in \nFunding commitments \noperations and its \nknowledge base \nOutputs      Risks \n1.

General \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) Project Preparation Support for Livable Cities in Asia will \nrequire inputs from international and national consultants drawn from a range of areas of \nexpertise, institutions, and organizations. The consultants will include urban and infrastructure \nexperts in planning, energy, transport, water supply and sanitation, environment, municipal \nmanagement,  urban  finance,  and  urban  economics.  The  national  consultants  will  provide \ntechnical and research assistance support for the TA implementation team and should have \nstrong background and experience in data collection and analysis, as well as practice in the \nareas listed above. A small secretariat will manage the TA and respond to requests from \noperations  departments.  Other  consultants  will  be  engaged  on  short-term  assignments  as \nrequired by operations departments. The detailed terms of reference for the consultants and \ntheir engagement periods will be finalized based on requests from operations departments in \nconsultation with the managing task force during the implementation of the TA. \n \nB.  Consultants \n \n1.  Component 1: Project Formulation \na.  Urban  and  Infrastructure  Consultants  (international,  40  person-\nmonths) \n2.  The tasks of the urban and infrastructure consultants will be to (i) undertake research in \nwaste  management,  urban  transport,  cluster  development,  and  municipal  finance  and \n(ii) support the operations of operations departments and analyze the impact of that support. \nThis analysis will provide support to the urban community of practice of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) and to establishing a partnership facility for the sector, which will fund enhanced \nurban operations. The consultants must be capable of designing new modalities of support and \ninnovative solutions, particularly in the areas of urban finance, energy, transport, water supply \nand sanitation, environment, and municipal management. This will require knowledge of existing \nliterature  and  ongoing  work  within  and  outside  ADB,  analysis  of  trends  and  issues,  the \nidentification of good practices and innovative approaches, and the ability to make suggestions \nabout how to more effectively deliver support in the urban sector. The general approach will be \nto (i) provide consulting support to the development of sector strategies and projects as required \nby operations departments, (ii) analyze the existing situation of the urban sector in ADB DMCs, \n(iii) analyze trends in the region, and (iv) use the experiences of developing and developed \ncountries to draw lessons for the sector. Consultants will be recruited as individuals, as set out \nin ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \nb.  Urban and Infrastructure Consultants (national, 60 person-months) \n3.  The main task of the national consultants will be to provide high-quality assistance and \ninputs for the international consultants, backed where needed by strong data analysis. The \ntasks  of  the  national  consultants  will  include  (i)  supporting  the  activities  of  international \nconsultants  in  the  field,  (ii)  reviewing  documents  and  literature,  (iii)  collecting  data  and \ninformation, (iv) quantitative and qualitative research and analysis, and (v) preparing notes and \nbriefs.
