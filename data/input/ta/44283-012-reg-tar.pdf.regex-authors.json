INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) discussed with the National Economic and Social \nDevelopment  Board  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  of  Thailand  and  the  Thailand \nDevelopment Research Institute the need to undertake an infrastructure assessment technical \nassistance (TA) in the Kingdom of Thailand with two aims. The first is to quickly review the \ninfrastructure development that Thailand has achieved in key infrastructure subsectors such as \npower, roads, and water supply and its plans for the future, including in particular the role of \nprivate sector investment in infrastructure projects. The second is to understand what lessons \nThailand\u2019s infrastructure development have for emerging middle-income countries, as well as for \nThailand's  own  prospective  investments  in  infrastructure.  In  2009,  Thailand  enjoyed  an \ninfrastructure quality index rank of 29, compared with Indonesia at 86, the Philippines at 92, and \nViet Nam at 93.1 Similarly, the Republic of Korea ranks at 15 but has a global competitiveness \nindex of 13, compared with Thailand at 34.2 Considering that the Republic of Korea is a leading \nand sizeable developing member country as well as a member of the Organization for Economic \nCo-operation  and  Development,  a  comparative  assessment  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  with \nThailand  will  help  understand  what  importance  the  Republic  of  Korea  has  placed  on \ninfrastructure development and what lessons Thailand can apply from its experience to take the \ncountry to the next level of development.  \n \n2.  The economic growth and improving competitiveness of both Thailand and the Republic \nof Korea has been underpinned to some extent by significant infrastructure development. The \ndiverse  and  rich  development  experiences  of  these  two  countries  emanate  from  their \ndifferences in economic policies and systems, dissimilarities in their institutions, and cultural and \nsocial diversity. Although there are significant gaps between the infrastructure capacities of both \ncountries as seen by global indicators, Thailand has made significant progress compared with \nsome of its regional neighbors and currently ranks second in Southeast Asia only to Malaysia, \nwhich has a global competitiveness index of 21 and an infrastructure quality index of 23. A \ncomparative assessment between Thailand and the Republic of Korea will help to understand \nthe enabling environment for the development of infrastructure and also review (i) infrastructure \ninvestment-led growth, (ii) the relationship between fiscal discipline and infrastructure spending, \n(iii) the impact of urban infrastructure development, (iv) the role of local and central government \nin infrastructure provision, (v) the participation of private sector and foreign investors, and (vi) \nthe financing of infrastructure development. Lessons from an exercise of this nature can create \na useful body of knowledge for Thailand and other developing and emerging Asian economies. \nPrior  to  undertaking  a  comparative  assessment,  the  existing  literature  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment  and  the  success  of  both  countries  will  be  analyzed  to  ensure  that  the  TA \ncontributes something new. The TA will closely synergize its efforts with a separate TA on \nmainstreaming  public\u2013private  partnerships  (PPPs)  in Thailand.3 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Asia's infrastructure gaps are serious because of the continent\u2019s rising urban populations; \ngrowing incomes; rapid industrialization; and burgeoning demand for energy, water, and mobility. \n                                                \n1  ADB and ADB Institute. 2009. Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia. Manila. \n2  World Economic Forum (2008). \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for Mainstreaming Public\u2013Private Partnerships. \nManila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 October 2010. \n ", "2   \nA  recent  study,  Infrastructure  for  a  Seamless  Asia  (footnote  1),  estimates  that  Asia's \ninfrastructure investment needs could be as high as $8 trillion by 2020. Resources of this order \nare always in short supply, and the recent global financial turmoil and resulting reduction in \nprivate investment have made matters worse. Asia's future development is crucially linked to \ninfrastructure. Developing bankable projects, finding resources, and building capacity for design, \ndelivery, and operation remain daunting tasks.  \n \n4.  Against this backdrop, a distillation of the experience of some of the other countries in \nAsia, and of the region in general, over the past 50 years suggests that the sustainability of \ninfrastructure  development  is  an  issue.  In  the  delicate  balance  between  affordability  and \neconomic growth, systems that depend on fossil fuels (e.g., coal-fired power plants and urban \ntransport systems that rely heavily on private cars) have led the way in many parts of Asia. \nThere  are  cases  where  emphasis  is  on  inefficient,  traditional  technologies  which  deny \nopportunities of leapfrogging to the next generation of technologies. A sustainable approach is \nfounded on the notion of \"smart growth.\" Environmental sustainability, characterized as low \nenergy, carbon, and water intensity, is a key to inclusive development that will improve access \nto services for all sections of the population, including the rural and urban poor. \n \n5.  Planning for infrastructure development in Asia requires a nuanced view of the region. \nAsia is not homogeneous, and neither are the development contexts or needs of its constituent \ncountries.  Basic  energy  and  transport  infrastructure  are  needed  by  South  Asia  and  most \ncountries in the Greater Mekong Subregion. The People\u2019s Republic of China is further ahead in \nthis respect and is developing an exemplary network of high-speed railway systems to enhance \nnational economic integration. Elsewhere, such as in the Republic of Korea and Malaysia, \nresources and capacity building are needed to maintain and upgrade existing infrastructure. A \ncommon thread that runs across this nuanced view is that the public sector can no longer be the \nprincipal infrastructure financier. Private capital and expertise have to be maximally leveraged.  \n \n6.  Financing Asia's infrastructure is a complex issue. All countries prepare medium to long \nterm development plans and strategies for the key sectors of energy, transport, and water \nsupply but they do not always come to fruition. The public sector has problems of constrained \naccess to funds, lack of competition, and governance and corruption issues further complicate \nthe  picture.  Private  sector  investors  prefer  to  prioritize  low-risk  countries.  The  lack  of  a \ntransparent  and  consistent  regulatory  environment  and  a  paucity  of  resources  and  policy \nsupport measures to meet the standards of global best practice further complicate matters. \nLand  acquisition  can  be  challenging  when  large-scale  projects  are  involved.  Untraditional \nfinancing, such as pension funds, early support mechanisms, and sovereign investment funds \nthat support various investments, partial government subsidies that buy down project risk such \nas the \"viability-gap funding\" provided in India and the Indonesia Infrastructure Finance Facility, \nwhich when operational will provide long tenor project financing, are some of the several options \nfor promoting infrastructure financing.  \n \n7.  Much of the Republic of Korea's economic growth was centered on policies which called \nfor extensive infrastructure development. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the country focused on \nrailway  and  highway  projects.  In  the  1970s,  however,  as  the  country  approached  full \nemployment,  bottlenecks  became  apparent.  Emphasis  then  shifted  to  heavy  industry  and \nchemicals, followed by telecommunications. In parallel, investments in deepwater ports were \nadded to the ongoing investments in roads and railways. Infrastructure spending has averaged \n8% of gross domestic product (GDP), most notably for telecommunications and broadband \ninternet  access.  This  enables  a  leadership  position  in  the  knowledge  economy.  However, \nprivate investments have not been forthcoming to the fullest extent, and the Government of the \n ", "                             3                       \nRepublic of Korea is currently experimenting with new, far-reaching reforms to leverage private \nfinancing  and  also  include  enhancing  the  use  of  information  technology  systems  and  e-\ncommerce to facilitate project transactions. \n \n8.  In light of this, it is instructive to learn from the infrastructure success story of the \nRepublic of Korea. During the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998, infrastructure programs were \namong the first to be cut in developing economies such as Indonesia, the Philippines, and \nThailand\u2014and to a much lesser extent in the Republic of Korea. As soon as the economy \nbegan to bounce back in the Republic of Korea, the government increased investment to pre-\ncrisis levels to create jobs and stimulate the economy. Thailand also has built high-quality roads \nand energy and telecoms infrastructure. While road and electricity coverage have risen to 99%, \nsome gaps exist in the quality of service delivery, management, and sector regulation. There \nare also imbalances in the transport connectivity mix, with roads outstripping railways by a \nsignificant margin which continue to under perform and unable to complement road networks. \nThe State Railway of Thailand has accumulated more than $2 billion in debts, which adds to the \ndifficult financial condition of the sector. The country\u2019s key infrastructure sectors such as energy \nand transport remain hostage to volatile global oil prices. As for water supply on the other hand, \nonly 60% of the country's urban centers are covered by the services of a metropolitan or \nprovincial water authority. The quality of service in the other 40% is largely poor, ranging up to \nfair and further work is required to connect more households and improve service delivery levels.  \n \n9.  The private sector has had a lesser role in meeting Thailand's infrastructure needs than \nin many of its neighbors, with only telecommunications and energy experiencing sustained \ninvestment. As in other countries in Asia, the telecoms sector in Thailand has shown good \nprogress in terms of expanding access with the entry of new service providers backed up by a \nstrong regulator. Similarly, another important step in PPPs was the first round of independent \npower producers bidding in 1994, with six companies receiving contracts for power generation. \nThe 1990s also saw private participation in the water and sanitation sector to a limited extent, \nincluding lease and management contracts from metropolitan and provincial water authorities. \n \n10.  Out  of  the  three  concessions  granted  in  1990s  for  mass  rapid  transit  projects  in \nmetropolitan Bangkok, only one, for the Green Line, was implemented. The Mass Rapid Transit \nAuthority was later established, in 1992, to take over rail transit from the Expressway Transit \nAuthority. After the Asian financial crisis, in 2000, another concession was granted for the \noperation and maintenance of the Blue Line. Ridership for both mass rapid transit projects has \nbeen below forecast, which is not unusual for such projects. However, ridership has also been \nadversely affected by the failure to integrate the two systems with each other\u2014either physically \nor for ticketing\u2014or with the public bus network. Expressway projects in Bangkok have faced \nproblems with land acquisition and the enforcement of contractually agreed tolls. Similarly, the \nport sector faces challenges, as the government wishes to develop a deepwater harbor in \nwestern Thailand to facilitate exports to Europe and elsewhere but faces strong resistance from \nthe local people.  \n \n11.  Although many factors account for a country\u2019s competitiveness in the global economy, \nthe provision of adequate infrastructure is constantly cited as a key pillar to encourage private \ninvestment  and  enhance  economic  growth.  Prior  to  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  government \ninvestment alone was as high as 10% of GDP in Thailand but has since slipped to less than \n5%.5 Subsequently, private investment in infrastructure projects also declined as a percentage \n                                                \n5 In countries such as Thailand and Indonesia, it is widely accepted that to achieve reasonable figures of economic \ngrowth of 6% or higher, governments should spend at least 5% of their GDP on infrastructure development. \n ", "4   \nof  GDP\u2014as  it  has  across  the  region.  The  current  Tenth  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Plan, 2007\u20132011 and the proposed 11th plan for 2012\u20132016 stress infrastructure \ndevelopment as a national priority to enhance Thailand\u2019s competitiveness and support long-term \ngrowth. Thailand\u2019s medium-term infrastructure investment program is a positive first step toward \nclosing the widening gap in infrastructure investment. A major policy initiative is to promote \neconomic  growth  through  infrastructure  development  over  the  medium-term,  and  the \ngovernment is keen to consider alternative modes of financing infrastructure and inviting private \nparticipation under PPP.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA's impact will be lessons learned for enhancing infrastructure provision in the key \nsectors of energy, transport, and water supply for developing member countries in Asia. The \nTA's outcome will be a comparative assessment of Thailand and the Republic of Korea on their \ninfrastructure development in energy, transport, and water supply.  \n   \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The key output of this TA is a comparative assessment of infrastructure development in \nThailand and the Republic of Korea to identify a range of lessons and good practices and an \nanalysis of the adequacy and effectiveness of policy measures in the two countries and the \ndistributional  impacts  of  infrastructure  development  on  different  sectors.  The  TA  will  be \nmonitored  through  regular  reporting,  building  consensus  with  workshops,  and  soliciting \ncomments and suggestions from key stakeholders. It will include an inception workshop in \nThailand one month after consultants have been mobilized. A series of smaller workshops will \nbe held to discuss the development and the progress of the TA with the National Economic and \nSocial Development Board (NESDB), the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI), and \nthe Ministry of Strategy and Finance of the Republic of Korea. In Thailand, NESDB and TDRI \nare the main infrastructure think tanks of the country.  \n \n14.  The  assumptions  for  undertaking  the  TA  are  (i)  the  final  report  is  accepted  by \ncounterparts in Thailand and the Republic of Korea, (ii) government counterparts provide the \nnecessary  support  to  the  consultant  teams,  and  (iii)  strong  ownership  by  the  government \ncounterparts themselves. The risks are (i) the lessons learned are not accepted by Thailand or \nthe Republic of Korea, (ii) change of government\u2019s mindset, and (iii) excessively broad demand \nfor study scope during implementation of the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The cost of the TA is $640,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis by \nthe Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, to be administered by ADB. \nThe Government of the Republic of Korea will finance, through the Ministry of Strategy and \nFinance,  a  further  $200,000  in  contributions  in  kind  and  in  cash,  and  the  Government  of \nThailand will finance $40,000 with in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "                             5                       \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency, with the Southeast Asia Department (SERD) and the \nEast  Asia  Department  (EARD)  as  focal  points.  The  TA  will  coordinate  with  the  regional \ndepartments as appropriate for communication and consultation with counterparts in Thailand \nand the Republic of Korea.  \n \n17.  The TA will require 12 person-months of international consulting services and 12 person-\nmonths  of  national  consulting  services.  To  ensure  a  diverse  array  of  skill  sets,  individual \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for the consultants are in \nAppendix 3. To successfully implement this TA, one SERD professional staff member and one \noperations  assistant  will  consolidate  consultants'  outputs  and  coordinate  and  administer \nconsultant contracts. SERD and EARD will review the outputs, which may be disseminated by \nwebsite publication, in-country workshops, electronic reports, and other means to be specified in \na knowledge dissemination action plan. ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time)  will  be  applicable  for  assets  purchased  for  the  project,  which,  upon \ncompletion, will be handed over to selected government agencies or disposed of in accordance \nwith ADB procedures. Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the ADB \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.    THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  for  the \nComparative  Infrastructure  Development  Assessment  of  the  Kingdom  of  Thailand  and  the \nRepublic of Korea, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6      Appendix 1                            \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nLessons learned for  At least five DMCs have  Global competitiveness  The final report is accepted by \nenhancing  incorporated a key lesson  reports  both Thai and Korean \ninfrastructure  from each of the sectors of    counterparts \nprovision in energy,  energy, transport, and  National plans   \ntransport, and water  water supply by December    Risk \nsupply sectors for   2015  State gazette and  The lessons learned are not \nDMCs in Asia    publications  accepted by Thailand and \n  Korea \nForeign investment body \nreports \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA  comparative  By December 2012, both  Planning agency reports,  Government counterparts \nassessment of  countries accept 50% of  including national plans  provide necessary support to \nThailand and the  the total recommendations    the consultant team \nRepublic of Korea on  of the comparative study.
