INTRODUCTION \n1.  Supporting the adoption of low-carbon technologies in developing member countries \n(DMCs) is imperative for mitigating climate change. The Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting \nMechanism  (JFJCM)  was  established  in  June  2014 to  support  implementation  of the  joint \ncrediting  mechanism  (JCM),  which  is  a  new  carbon  market  mechanism  initiated  by  the \nGovernment of Japan to promote greenhouse gas emission-reduction projects. It is a market \nmechanism between two countries, with a structure and procedures similar to those of the \nClean  Development  Mechanism.  The  JCM  implements  greenhouse  gas  emission-reduction \nprojects in developing countries with which Japan has a bilateral JCM agreement.1  \n2.  The  JFJCM  promotes  advanced  low-carbon  technologies  in  eligible  DMCs  through \nprovision of grants and technical assistance (TA) that encourage adoption of advanced low \ncarbon technologies in ADB-financed and administered sovereign and nonsovereign projects \nusing the principles of the JCM. To promote low carbon technologies using JFJCM, projects \nshould  include  a  component  that  will  adopt  an  advanced  low-carbon  technology  that  can \nconsiderably reduce carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions in the long term. For nonsovereign projects, \n2\na proof of additionality (i.e., need for concessional financing for the project to be viable or \nacceptable from a risk-reward perspective) will be required.2 \n3.  The TA will support the increased adoption of low-carbon technologies and promote \nclimate change mitigation and environmentally sustainable growth. The initial focus of the TA \nwill be on those ADB DMCs that have a bilateral agreement (or are currently negotiating) with \nthe Government of Japan for implementation of the JCM.3 The country partnership strategies of \neligible DMCs have identified climate change mitigation as a priority.  The TA is aligned with the \ncountry partnership strategies of these eligible DMCs. \n4.  The TA will provide capacity building and technical support to DMCs in identifying and \npreparing grant proposals for the adoption of low-carbon technologies. The TA will also support \nthe identification and dissemination of best practices in the use of low-carbon technologies. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nIII.  ISSUES \n5.  Rapid economic growth in Asia and the Pacific have resulted in the region becoming a \nmajor source of greenhouse gas emissions. The region\u2019s CO  emissions accounted for 42.8% of \n2\nworld CO  emissions in 2010 and could reach more than half of world CO  emissions in 2035.5 \n2 2\nDecoupling the region\u2019s growth from carbon emissions is crucial for global efforts to mitigate \nclimate change. Considerable investments will be required to enable developing countries to \ntransition to a low-carbon development pathway. With limited public sector financing available, \ncarbon  market  mechanisms  play  an  important  role  in  mobilizing  financing  for  low-carbon \n                                                \n1  As of March 2016, the Government of Japan has signed agreements for the JCM with 16 countries, 10 of which\u2014\nBangladesh, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Myanmar, Mongolia, Palau, \nThailand, and Viet Nam\u2014are DMCs of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Discussions are ongoing with the \nGovernment of the Philippines with respect to entering into a JCM bilateral agreement for the promotion of the \nJCM. JFJCM implementation guidelines were issued in October 2014. \n2  The detailed criteria for projects to be supported by the JFJCM are in Section IV of the JFJCM guidelines. \n3  As of March 2016, the Philippines has officially initiated discussions on the JCM with the Government of Japan. \nCountries that officially initiate discussions on the JCM during TA implementation will be covered under the TA. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 May 2016. \n5  ADB. 2015. Energy Outlook for Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n ", "2  \ndevelopment. Since 2005, the Clean Development Mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol has \nsupported countries with emissions-reduction commitments and promoted the mobilization of \nlow-carbon investments.6 \n6.  The 21st Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange (held in Paris in 2015) adopted the Paris Agreement, which reaffirmed the role of \ncarbon market mechanisms, although not in their past form. Article 6, para. 2 of the Paris \nAgreement creates cooperative approaches that allow parties to pursue voluntary cooperation in \nimplementing their nationally determined contributions through the use and transfer of emission \nreductions  to  other  countries.  This  enables:  (i)  various  national  and/or  regional  emissions \ntrading systems to be linked; and (ii) further development of bilateral mechanisms such as the \nJCM7. \n \n7.  As an incentive to promote low carbon technologies in DMCs, donor support will be \nsought. Current recipients and those expected to enter into bilateral agreements will need \ncapacity  building  and technical  support  to  identify  opportunities for  adoption  of  low-carbon \ntechnology in their projects and develop proposals for funding under financing mechanisms \nsuch as the JFJCM.  In the case of JFJCM, assessment of the low-carbon technology will \ninclude: (i) the level of the advanced technology and data regarding its technical effectiveness; \n(ii)  the  incremental  cost  of  deploying  advanced  low-carbon  technologies  (compared  with \nnormally  employed  technology);  and  (iii)  the  evaluation  and  qualification  criteria,  including \ntechnical performance-related criteria and technical specifications to enable the life-cycle cost of \nthe facility to be calculated. Capacity building support will focus on: \n \n(i)  identifying  opportunities  for  the  adoption  of  low-carbon  technologies  in  ADB \nprojects;  \n(ii)  increasing the knowledge of DMC officials on the financing mechanisms such as \nthe JFJCM;8 \n(iii)  developing projects that adopt low-carbon technologies and preparing project \ndesign  documents  (PDDs)  in  accordance  with  the  donor  procedures  and \nguidelines; and \n(iv)  monitoring  grant  implementation,  submitting  reports,  and  verifying \nimplementation of projects in accordance with the donor requirements. \n \n 8.  The TA will build on the capacity building support provided under ongoing ADB TA for \nSupporting the Use of Carbon Financing from New Carbon Market Mechanisms to Promote \nGreen Growth in Asia and the Pacific.9 The TA will focus on providing hands-on support for \n                                                \n6 Under the Kyoto Protocol, countries with emissions-reduction or emissions-limitation commitments are known as \nAnnex B parties. \n7  The JCM aims to: (i) facilitate the diffusion of advanced low-carbon technologies, products, systems, services, and \ninfrastructure as well as the implementation of other mitigation actions to contribute to the sustainable development of \ndeveloping countries; and (ii) estimate contributions to greenhouse gas emission reductions through mitigation \nactions implemented in developing countries and the use of those emission reductions to achieve the emission \nreduction targets of developed countries. \n8 The JFJCM process includes the following steps: (i) conduct preliminary screening to identify the project pipeline \nand low-carbon technologies to be supported by the JFJCM; (ii) evaluate advanced low-carbon technologies related \nto the project pipeline, including assessing their benefits and costs, operational record, and other technology-related \ninformation required by JFJCM; (iii) prepare and submit PDDs required by the JCM, including methodologies \napplicable to JCM projects for calculating emission reductions and monitoring the JCM project (JCM methodology); \n(iv) request validation of PDDs by third-party entities and register PDDs with the JCM joint committee; and (v) monitor, \nsubmit reports, and verify project implementation in accordance with JCM requirements. \n9 ADB.  2014.

The TA will also help coordinate with the Government of Japan and \nJCM joint committee members in DMCs participating or preparing to participate in the JCM to \nprovide updates on JCM implementation. \n \nIV.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  will  be  increased  adoption  of  low  carbon  technologies  in  DMCs.  The \noutcome will be increased capacity of DMCs to develop low-carbon technology projects and \naccess finance. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will have two outputs: (i) increased knowledge on low-carbon technologies and \nfinancing mechanisms delivered; and (ii) hands-on support for low carbon project development \nprovided.  \n \n11.  Increased  knowledge  on  low-carbon  technology  and  financing  mechanisms \ndelivered. This output will conduct workshops for DMC officials and project developers from \neligible DMCs on developments in low-carbon technologies and opportunities for use in ADB \nprojects; and financing mechanisms. These workshops will also provide knowledge about JCM \nstructures and requirements for processing and implementation, including monitoring; JFJCM \nand financing mechanisms procedures and requirements; case studies of several projects that \napply  advanced  low-carbon  technologies;  and  best  practices  on  the  use  of  low-carbon \ntechnologies.  \n \n12.  Hands-on support for low carbon project development provided. This output will \nprovide hands-on support for project development, in tandem with the loan preparation process \nfor ADB projects, in order to meet donor requirements. It will provide support for (i) identifying \nprojects with the potential to contribute to greenhouse gas emissions reduction; (ii) assessing \nthe opportunities for the use of advanced low-carbon technologies in the ADB project pipeline, \nincluding their incremental cost; (iii) research on advanced low-carbon technologies, particularly \nthose that can potentially be used by ADB projects; and (iv) drafting PDDs. \n \n13.  Potential risks are identified in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1. To \nminimize  the  risk  that  DMCs  do  not  have  pipeline  projects  that  can  utilize  low-carbon \ntechnologies, the TA will review the Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions of participating \ncountries and work with ADB\u2019s operations departments to identify projects with potential to use \nadvanced low-carbon technologies. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \ninstitutional capacity to effectively participate in, and take advantage of, bilateral mechanisms such as JCM. The \nongoing TA has held capacity development workshops in Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic, the Philippines, Thailand, and Viet Nam, and will be closed by September 2016. The JFJCM TA will cover \nall DMCs with bilateral agreements with the Government of Japan, but will prioritize those DMCs that were not \ncovered by the ongoing TA.  This is in order to broaden the scope of the JCM. \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJFJCM and administered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  As the executing and implementing agency, ADB will administer the TA activities through \nthe Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department\u2019s Environment and Safeguards \nDivision (SDES) in close coordination with the operations departments and resident missions.10 \nAn SDES staff member will act as the TA team leader. TA implementation will be from July 2016 \nto June 2018 (24 months). The capacity building and knowledge-dissemination activities to be \nimplemented by the TA will be determined based on the needs of DMCs. \n \n16.  The TA will finance consulting services, workshops and training, and report preparation. \nAn  individual  international  consultant  (Low  Carbon  Project  Development  Specialist)  will  be \nengaged for 22 person-months and a national consultant (TA Coordinator) will be engaged for \n18  person-months.  Consultants  will  be  under  the  direct  supervision  of  SDES.  Individual \nconsultants  (Low  Carbon  Technology  Expert,  Clean  Development  Mechanism  Expert  and \nNational Project Coordinator) and  will be recruited on an as-needed basis to provide direct \nsupport for project preparation and implementation for low carbon projects that will be identified \nby operations departments. Consultant terms of reference will be developed on an as-needed \nbasis,  covering  market  surveys  and  technology  identification,  and  methodology  and  PDD \ndevelopment. The outline terms of reference for consultants (in Appendix 3) will be finalized \nbased on the pipeline and DMCs to be covered. Consultants will assist in developing the \ntechnology-related  requirements  for  the  advanced  low-carbon  technologies  that  have  the \npotential to be used for ADB\u2019s pipeline, and support project developers and sponsors in writing \nPDDs and the new MRV methodologies. Individual consultants will have expertise on low-\ncarbon technology and MRV methodologies in various sectors, including energy efficiency, \nrenewable  energy,  water,  and  transport.  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individual \nconsultants following ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time \nto time). \n \n17.  All procurement will be in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2015, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Support and advice \nwill  be  provided  to  JCM  secretariats  in  DMC  governments  for  coordination  with  project \ndevelopers, to organize workshops, and to provide hands-on support regarding low carbon \ntechnology project requirements.11 \n \n18.  The TA will be monitored by the TA Team Leader and peer reviewed by the technical \nadvisory  group  established  under  the  JFJCM. 12  Good  practices  and  lessons  will  be \n                                                \n10 ADB\u2019s operations departments and resident missions in charge of eligible countries of the JFJCM will be engaged \nin the TA. As of May 2016, DMCs from the East Asia Department, Pacific Department, Private Sector Operations \nDepartment, South Asia Department, and Southeast Asia Department have signed bilateral agreements with the \nGovernment of Japan for the JCM. \n11 The JCM secretariat helps manage the implementation of JCM activities by working with the host country and \nJapan. Its main function is to support the JCM joint committee and relevant stakeholders, to act as a center of JCM \ninformation and communication, and to collaborate with all stakeholders to ensure smooth implementation. \n12 The technical advisory group constitutes representatives from relevant ADB communities of practice (agriculture, \nenergy, transport, urban, water, and environment). \n ", "  5\ndisseminated through TA workshops and posted on the ADB website. After the TA closes, the \nfund secretariat will operate and maintain information on ADB\u2019s website. \n \nV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Fund for the Joint Crediting Mechanism for Supporting the Adoption \nof Low Carbon Technologies in Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nAdoption of low-carbon technologies in DMCs increased (defined by the project) \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nIncreased capacity of  a.
