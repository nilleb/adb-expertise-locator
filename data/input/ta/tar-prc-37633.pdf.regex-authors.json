During the Country Program Update Mission in 2003, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical assistance \n(TA) to further promote alternative energy supply for the rural poor in remote areas\u2014to support \nits economic development and poverty reduction efforts. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2005 TA \nprogram and the PRC Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132007.1 In April 2005, The \nTA was endorsed by the Department for International Development of the Government of the \nUnited  Kingdom  for  funding  by  the  Poverty  Reduction  Cooperation  Fund  (PRCF-PRC).                    \nA fact-finding mission visited the PRC on 19 June 2005 and reached an agreement with the \nGovernment on the impact, outcome, implementation arrangements, cost, financing plan, and \nterms of reference.2 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  About  70%  of  the  PRC\u2019s  1.3  billion  population  lives  in  rural  areas,  which  have \nexperienced rapid development in the last 10 years in parallel with national economic growth. \nHowever,  remote  rural  areas  have  weak  transport  services,  which  complicate  delivery  of \nmodern fuels such as oil and gas. Providing access to reliable and efficient energy\u2014especially \nelectricity\u2014is a great challenge in remote rural areas. The PRC has achieved more than 95% \nelectrification at village and household level through (i) expansion of provincial electricity grids; \n(ii) development of local hydropower resources; and (iii) more recently, promotion of other \nalternative energy sources. Yet, about 70 million people in over 20,000 villages in remote rural \nareas do not have access to electricity. In rural areas of the northern and western provinces, far \nfrom the nearest grid, electricity provision through the extension of power grids is an expensive \nsolution. But these areas are rich in alternative energy sources\u2014wind, solar, and biomass\u2014so \ndecentralized electrification from alternative energy is often the most practical solution. \n \n3.  The  Government  has  put  priority  on  alternative  energy-based  rural  electrification  of \nremote households and communities, and began efforts with subsidies for small hydropower \ndevelopment. In the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996\u20132000), two key programs were introduced to \naccelerate decentralized electrification of remote rural areas. First, the national \u201cBrightness \nProgram\u201d, which aims to provide electricity to 23 million people in remote rural areas by 2010 \nthrough solar, wind, and solar-wind hybrid systems, was launched in 1996.3 It targets three \nprovinces  with  adequate  resources  and  sparse  populations\u2014Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous \nRegion (IMAR), Gansu, and Tibet. Second, in 2002, the Government initiated the National \nTownship Electrification Program, which is the world\u2019s largest alternative energy-based rural \nelectrification program. By the end of 2004, 20 megawatts of solar power and 840 kilowatts of \nwind power were installed under the program to electrify the remaining 1,065 unelectrified \ntownships in the country.   \n \n4.  IMAR\u2019s vast area and highly dispersed population present unique challenges to rural \nelectrification  and  meeting  rural  energy  needs  in  an  efficient,  environmentally  sustainable \nmanner. As one of the 12 western provinces, IMAR has benefited less than the east coast from \neconomic growth and reforms. This is reflected in (i) lower incomes; (ii) more widespread \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2005\u20132007): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 August 2004. \n3  Formulated under the leadership of the National Development and Reform Commission, the Brightness Program \ntargets an average of about 100 watts (W) per person.  \n \n \n ", "2   \npoverty; (iii) lower health and education indicators; (iv) serious land degradation problems; and \n(v) weak physical infrastructure (including roads, railways, power, and telecommunications). \nAbout 74% of IMAR\u2019s 24 million inhabitants live in rural areas. In 2003, IMAR\u2019s average per \ncapita gross domestic product was CNY8,734, below the national average of CNY9,046. Of the \nprovince\u2019s  101  counties,  31  are  national  poverty  counties  and  29  are  provincial  poverty \ncounties. In 2003, about 1.3 million people\u2014more than 10% of IMAR\u2019s rural population\u2014lived \non incomes below the official poverty line (CNY668 per capita/year) compared with the national \nrate of 3%. About 2.5 million people\u201418% of the rural population\u2014had incomes below the \ninternational poverty line of $1/day. \n \n5.  IMAR is the third largest province in the PRC, covering 1.18 million square kilometers. \nMost of the province is about 1,000 meters above sea level with low average rainfall, so it is \npoorly suited for agriculture, and is characterized by sparsely populated households (average \ndistance of 2\u20135 kilometers apart). A large proportion of IMAR inhabitants do not have near-term \nprospects of access to grid electricity because of the (i) high cost of building transmission and \ndistribution lines to remote locations, (ii) high service delivery cost because of low population \ndensity and dispersion over a large area, (iii) low demand, and (iv) low affordability because of \nvariable income levels, with a large number of people living at or below the national poverty line.  \n \n6.  IMAR  has  abundant  conventional  energy  resources 4  and  exports  electricity  to \nneighboring provinces. It is also rich in alternative solar and wind energy resources.5 The \nGovernment of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (GIMAR) recognizes the techno-economic \nlimitations of grid extension to electrify remote rural households and has promoted alternative \nenergy-based decentralized electrification since 1986. GIMAR subsidizes two thirds of the wind \nand solar system cost for unelectrified households to promote basic electrification.6 It has also \nparticipated in both major national rural electrification programs (para. 3). Since 1995, wind-only \nhousehold electrification has been considered less attractive, as it is unable to provide electricity \nduring  the  low-wind  summer.  The  household  hybrid  alternative  energy  system  using \ncomplementary seasonal wind and solar resources, is now preferred.7 At the end of 2004, \napproximately 140,000 small wind systems, as well as a few solar systems, had been installed. \n \n7.  Basic electrification for IMAR households has achieved mixed results and faces many \nchallenges, which can be classified as follows: \n  \n(i)  Poor system configuration. Current practice for system design is based on a \nset  system  configuration  with  little  regard  for  local  resources  and  unique \nrequirements of specific users. This has led to dissatisfaction among end users \nwho found them restrictive in meeting their energy needs.  \n \n(ii)  Technical. Variable quality of components, and poor system installation and \nmaintenance8 have led to the development of certification standards and testing \nfacilities but they lack proper coordination.  \n                                                 \n4  These  include  (i)  223  billion  tons  (t)  of  proven  coal  reserves  and  1,200  billion  t  of  prospective  reserves; \n(ii) 700 million t of proven oil reserves and 4 billion t of estimated reserves; and (iii) 1 trillion cubic meters (m3) of \nproven natural gas reserves and 4.2 trillion m3 of prospective reserves. \n5  Estimates indicate that IMAR has average solar radiation of 4.2 kilowatt-hours per square meter per day for more \nthan 300 days a year and an average wind speed of 6.5 m/second for more than 3,000 hours/year.  \n6  Basic electrification includes households using the wind and solar system (300 W sets) powering light bulbs and \nsmall electrical appliances only.  \n7  Standard system configuration: 300 W wind turbine, 100\u2013200 W photovoltaic panel, and 500 W inverter. \n8  A survey by the US Department of Energy in 2004 found that only about 50% of the systems were in good \ncondition after 5 years of operation, mainly due to poor manufacturing quality and inadequate end-user education. \n ", "  3\n(iii)  Financial. Developing innovative financing and marketing approaches to enable \nlow income households to buy decentralized systems. GIMAR\u2019s subsidy scheme \nfor household-owned systems, which ensures ownership by end users, has been \nsuccessful  but  70,000  households  in  400  villages  are  still  without  basic \nelectrification.  \n \n(iv)  Institutional. The institutional setup for system operation and maintenance is \nweak. Distribution and maintenance infrastructure should be expanded to provide \nservice to remote dispersed households. Poor after-sales service, due to limited \naccess to the remote rural areas, leads to frequent and prolonged breakdown of \ndecentralized systems.  \n \n(v)  Poor user knowledge base. The end user has limited knowledge of how to \noperate the system properly, leading to frequent failures.  \n \n8.  There  is  an  urgent  need  to  strengthen  basic  electrification  in  IMAR  so  that  it  can \n(i) support  further  social  infrastructure  development,  (ii)  promote  income  generation \nopportunities, and (iii) spur economic development of remote areas. GIMAR wishes to evaluate \nthe  performance  of  existing  installations  and  their  socioeconomic  impact  on  remote  rural \nhouseholds and communities so that it can identify and analyze options for further expansion \nand  intensification  of  electrification.  The  existing  140,000  sets  of  alternative  energy \ninstallations\u2014including solar, wind, and solar-wind hybrid systems\u2014provide a critical mass to \nevaluate and identify the most appropriate strategy to expand basic rural electrification into a \nsustainable rural energy model.  \n \n9.  Operation and maintenance management capacity is a significant issue, which impacts \nthe long-term sustainability of community based decentralized electrification. A comparative \nstudy of management approaches adopted in IMAR should be used to formulate an appropriate \nsustainable  community-based  power  system.  A  rural  energy  service  company  or  similar \napproaches, which have been successful under similar conditions in other countries, could \nintegrate disparate decentralized systems. There is also a need to identify barriers (social, \nfinancial,  and  institutional),  which  have  prevented  70,000  households  in  400  villages  from \nseeking basic electrification through government subsidies. The Government aims to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of its subsidy scheme and target them at marginal and poor households.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s operational strategy in the PRC aims to facilitate economic growth in an efficient, \nequitable,  and  sustainable  manner.  In  the  energy  sector,  ADB  supports  the  Government's \nenergy  development  program  aimed  at  expanding  energy  supplies  and  promoting  energy \nconservation and end-use efficiency. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy for the PRC includes \nproviding goods and services directly to the most vulnerable members of society, and promoting \nsustainable  growth.  The  proposed  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  strategies  and \ngovernment priorities.  \n \n11.  ADB is providing assistance to GIMAR to formulate an energy development strategy,9 \nwhich aims to provide policy recommendations to develop IMAR as a national energy base, and \nharmonize energy sector development with overall economic and environmental development. \nThe proposed TA will complement this study and provide policy and strategic recommendations \non development of alternative energy to meet rural energy needs.  \n \n                                                 \n9 ADB. 2004.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  improved  economic  development  and  better  living \nstandards in remote rural areas of IMAR. The outcome will be to assist GIMAR in formulating a \nstrategy for expansion of alternative energy-based electrification in remote rural areas, including \na strategy to improve sustainability of existing decentralized installations.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will (i) review the existing GIMAR approach and policies on basic electrification; \n(ii) short-list villages and households for socioeconomic assessment of basic electrification, \n(iii) undertake a socioeconomic survey to collect data on decentralized electrification systems; \n(iv) carry out analysis of the basic electrification approach; (v) analyze the impact of the ongoing \nsubsidy  scheme  and  recommend  a  mechanism  to  enhance  the  sustainability  of  rural \nelectrification;  (vi)  compare  and  contrast  community-based  centralized  systems  and     \nhousehold-based  decentralized  systems  to  identify  a  structure  for  rural  community  and \nhousehold  electrification;  (vii)  identify  mechanisms  to  promote  community  participation  in \ndesign, and operation and maintenance of decentralized system; (viii) undertake rural energy \nresource assessment in short-listed villages to identify optimal energy mix for rural needs; \n(ix) evaluate  and  identify  an  appropriate  rural  energy  business  model;  (x)  analyze  and \nrecommend  a  strategic  approach  to  expand  and  intensify  alternative  energy-based  rural \nelectrification; (xi) develop train-the-trainer program to extend maintenance services to remote \ndispersed households; (xii) identify a package of policy and regulatory initiatives to create \nenabling conditions for the proposed strategic approach; (xiii) examine possibilities of leveraging \nand integrating incentives through a clean development mechanism and global environmental \nfacility mechanism; (xiv) develop a monitoring and evaluation framework for TA outcomes; and \n(xv) conduct workshops and seminars to disseminate TA results.  \n \n14.  Major assumptions and risks that need to be considered for successful implementation \nof the TA include (i) a change in GIMAR\u2019s priorities, (ii) lack of adequate, in-time data provision, \n(iii) delay in submission of required studies, (iv) delay in selection of consultants, and (v) poor \nperformance of consultants. Efforts will be made by ADB to ensure that competent consultants \nwill be recruited on time. GIMAR agrees to provide adequate counterpart support and data \nwhen  needed.  Close  coordination  among  the  consultants,  executing  and  implementing \nagencies, and ADB will further mitigate these risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 equivalent, of which $345,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $355,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$500,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $155,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund, administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $200,000 through in-kind contributions, including office accommodation and \nfacilities, counterpart staff, data, and other information needs. Detailed cost estimates are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  GIMAR will be the Executing Agency and will provide a TA coordinator for day-to-day \nimplementation management. GIMAR will set up a steering committee or lead group consisting \nof key stakeholders and relevant GIMAR departments (Finance, Development and Reform \nCommission, Poverty Reduction, etc.) within 2 weeks of commencement of the TA to oversee \nand guide implementation and help disseminate results.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months from December 2005 to August 2006. The \nTA will require 10 person-months of international and 22 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices. The consultant will procure office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement, and deliver it to the Executing Agency at the conclusion of the TA.  \n \n18.  ADB will engage the international and domestic consultants using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and \nsimplified  technical  proposals  will  be  requested.  The  following  experts  will  be  required:              \n(i)  alternative  energy  development  specialist,  (ii)  institutional  development  specialist,               \n(iii) financial analyst, (iv) economist, and (v) social/poverty specialist. Outline terms of reference \nfor consulting services are in Appendix 3.  \n \n19.  The consultant will submit an inception report within 1 month after TA commencement, a \nmidterm report after 4 months, and a draft final report after 8 months. The final report will be \nsubmitted within 9 months of TA commencement. TA activities will be undertaken using a \nparticipatory approach\u2014stakeholder participation will be encouraged through workshops and \nseminars  to  progressively  discuss  and  share  TA  results.  Tripartite  meetings  will  be  held \nbetween ADB, GIMAR and the consultants after the submission of the inception and the draft \nfinal reports. The recommendations of the TA will be disseminated through a provincial level \nseminar with broad participation from all stakeholders. A national level seminar will be organized \nat the final stages of the TA to disseminate TA results to poorer provinces of PRC, who are \nfacing similar challenges in meeting the energy needs of the remote rural areas. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for the Alternative Energy Supply for Rural Poor in Remote Areas, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved economic  Lower level of poverty  IMAR statistics  \u2022 Government of Inner \ndevelopment and better  in rural areasa    Mongolia Autonomous \nliving standards in      Region (GIMAR) sustains \nremote rural areas in  Increased electricity    priority and resources for \nInner Mongolia  supply to households  economic development of \nAutonomous Region  and communities\u201485%  remote rural areas \n(IMAR)  of the remaining   \nhouseholds without  \u2022 Technical Assistance \npower supply to obtain  (TA) recommendations \nelectricity by 2010  are implemented \n  effectively \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nStrategy developed to  Memorandum of  Consultant\u2019s final report  \u2022 Effective stakeholder \nexpand alternative  understanding of final    participation and \nenergy-based  tripartite meeting  Memorandum of  ownership developed \nelectrification in remote  signed by GIMAR and  understanding    \nrural areas of IMAR  Asian Development    Risk \nBank (ADB)  Back-to-office report of  \u2022 Key stakeholders do not \nfinal TA review mission  follow strategy \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
