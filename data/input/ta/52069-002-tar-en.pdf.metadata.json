The Government of Pakistan (the Government) has set itself an ambitious target of \ncreating 10 million jobs over five years, with a special focus on skill-building through technical and \nvocational education and training (TVET) in its first term. Achieving this target will require much \nbetter performance from the TVET sector. The scale of improvement required can be seen from \nthe Global Competitiveness Report 2018, which showed that Pakistan ranked 125th overall for \nskills \u2013 with individual rankings of 90th for the quality of vocational training, 51st for the skillset of \ngraduates, and 63rd for ease of finding skilled employees.1  \n \n2.  Since the passage of the 18th Constitutional Amendment in 2010, provincial governments \nin Pakistan are responsible for delivering, funding and regulating TVET. In Punjab, the Industries, \nCommerce and Investment Department (ICID) has overall responsibility for the TVET sector, \nalthough many departments and agencies are involved in the sector. There are two principal \npublic TVET providers in Punjab: the Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority \n(TEVTA) has some 400 institutes, while the Punjab Vocational Training Council (PVTC) has some \n270 institutes. TEVTA and PVTC are government funded. TEVTA is financed through ICID, while \nPVTC is funded through the Zakat and Ushr Department and the Planning and Development \nDepartment. Other TVET institutes include public providers operated by other governments \ndepartments and agencies, and a large private sector. TEVTA and PVTC also operate TVET \nteacher training centers. The structure of the TVET sector in Punjab is set out in Appendix 4.  \n \n3.  The size of the TVET sector in Punjab dwarfs that in other provinces. In 2017, there were \nsome 1,600 TVET institutes and 238,000 TVET enrolments in Punjab, representing 46.0% of all \nTVET institutes and 56.8% of all TVET enrolments in Pakistan. By comparison, Sindh had only \n17.0% of TVET institutes and 18.1% of TVET enrolments in Pakistan in 2017.2 The labor market \nin Punjab is characterized by low levels of skills, low female participation and a large informal \nsector.3 Women\u2019s labor force participation is around one-third that of men. There is substantial \noccupational segregation, with females more likely to work in traditional jobs such as dressmakers \nand beauticians.4 Over 60% of the Pakistan population is under 25 and youth have low levels of \neducation and little exposure to TVET. The unemployment rate for youth is high.5 The TVET \nsector\u2019s challenges limit its ability to support competitiveness and inclusive economic growth \nthrough the supply of skilled workers. These challenges include:  \n \n\u2022  Quality and relevance of TVET. This is due to several factors, including outdated training \nmethods, assessment techniques, curricula, and equipment; shortages of trained and \nqualified  TVET  instructors;  limited  linkages  between  the  TVET  sector  and  industry, \nincluding limited private sector participation in curriculum development; limited scope for \non-the-job training for trainees; and limited private sector delivery of TVET.   \n \n\u2022  Participation in TVET. TVET trainees represent only 4\u22125% of the population aged 16\u221220 \nyears in Punjab. This is due to lack of TVET provision in some areas, low government and \nprivate sector spending on TVET, low female labor force participation rates, and education \n \n1  World Economic Forum. 2018.

Washington DC. \n ", "2 \nrequirements for accessing TVET. TVET participation is particularly limited for women and \npeople in rural areas. In 2016/17, females made up 22.8% of enrolments and 24% of \nteachers at TEVTA institutes. They made up 48% of enrolments and 46% of teachers in \nPVTC institutes in 2017.6 Women in TVET usually enroll in traditional female courses, with \nlittle encouragement to enter male-dominated programs. The poor quality and relevance \nof TVET in Punjab also constrains TVET demand as potential trainees see little benefit \nfrom TVET in terms of higher future incomes or increased job opportunities.  \n \n\u2022  TVET policy and institutional framework. This includes the absence of an agency with \noverall responsibility for the planning, governance, regulation, quality assurance and \nfinancing of TVET in the province and fragmented responsibility for quality assurance. The \nskills  development  system  is  fragmented  and  lacks  the  mechanisms  to  deliver  a \ncoordinated strategy, given the multiple funding streams and quality assurance agencies. \nThere is a lack of systemic information collection and there is no centralized database on \nthe TVET sector. The capacity of TVET institute management is also of concern.7  \n \n4.  Improving  the  performance  of  the  TVET  sector  in  Punjab  can  help  lift  Pakistan\u2019s \ndevelopment prospects given that it is the country\u2019s most populous province; its economic \npowerhouse, and has several industrial centers including Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Multan, \nand Rawalpindi. Improved skills development was central to the Government of Punjab\u2019s (GoPb) \nPunjab Growth Strategy 2018. The GoPb is also developing industrial clusters and supporting \ntheir further integration into global value chains. This initiative seeks to create an enabling \nenvironment for industrial growth and prosperity, improve the quality of life through economic \nuplift, upgrade technology, and enhance productivity, quality and profitability of local industries.8  \n \n5.  Weaknesses in the TVET sector have led to a serious shortage of skilled workers in \nPunjab, which constrains economic growth and adversely affects the performance of industry. \nAccording to one survey, 60% of firms said that the TVET system did not produce enough people \nwith the skills required by employers, and more than 50% of firms said that the TVET system did \nnot produce enough people with up-to-date knowledge of methods, materials and technology.9 A \nsurvey  of  Lahore-based  manufacturers  identified  inadequately  trained  workers  as  a  key \nimpediment  to  industrial  performance.  While  skill  shortages  affected  both  large  and \nsmall/medium enterprises, the impact was greater on the latter.10 Improving TVET can help \nclose  the  skills  gap,  reduce  unemployment,  increase  productivity,  lift  competitiveness  and \npromote foreign direct investment.11,12,13  \n   \n \n6  Punjab Commission on the Status of Women. 2018.

This will include \nassisting in the preparation of all documents required for project processing, including the: \n(i) Report and Recommendation of the President (RRP) and all RRP linked documents, \n(ii) the project administration manual; and (iii) project startup and implementation support, \nincluding establishment of the project implementation unit.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n8.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $0.88 million equivalent, of which $0.8 million will be \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6).  The \nGovernment will provide in-kind assistance in the form of exemption from taxes and duties, office \naccommodation, and counterpart staff. The cost estimates and financing plan are listed in \nAppendix 1.  \n \n14 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 April 2019 \n \n ", "4 \n9.  The Government was informed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n10.  ADB will administer the TRTA. ICID will be the executing agency, while the Technical \nEducation and Vocational Training Authority (TEVTA) and the Punjab Vocational Training Council \n(PVTC) will be implementing partners. The Social Sector Division of the Central and West Asia \nDepartment will coordinate project preparation. The TRTA will be implemented from April 2019 to \nApril 2021 to ensure effective project preparation and startup. Implementation will be coordinated \nwith development partners through the Punjab Skills Advisory Forum. Disbursements will be \nmade in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (May 2010, as \namended from time to time).
