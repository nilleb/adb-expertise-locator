During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Gansu Clean Energy Project Loan Fact-\nFinding Mission in 2003, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested \nADB  assistance  to  promote  sustainable  energy  development  in  poor  and  rural  areas  of \nZhangye, Gansu Province. ADB Country Strategy and Program of 2003 included the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA). The ADB Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC from 29 to 31 October \n2003.  Discussions  were  held  with  the  Government  on  the  TA  goals,  purpose,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. \nThe TA framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \nA.  Energy Balance in the Project Area \n \n2.  The Zhangye grid has experienced power shortages since the mid-1980s due to lack of \ngeneration capacity and the long distance to other generation sources. Installed generating \ncapacity is 94.5 megawatts (MW) against a peak demand of about 200 MW. Power generation \nin 2001 was 163 gigawatt hours (GWh) against a demand of 900 GWh. The deficit of 737 GWh \nwas resolved through load shedding and importing power from the Hexi corridor grid. The power \nsituation in Zhangye will worsen as demand increases until new capacity is added.2 By 2010 the \nenergy deficit will require importing 914 GWh. \n \n3.  Although electrification extends to 97% of the population, poor and rural customers \nreceive sporadic service and are the first to experience service interruptions. Under current grid \nexpansion plans and without new initiatives to deliver improved energy service, poor and rural \nconsumers will continue to experience poor service. Due to limited local fossil fuel resources in \nZhangye, hydropower and other renewable energy options are cost-competitive. \n \n4.  In Zhangye, energy services are viewed as a government responsibility, but limited \nfinancial resources constrain government-led project development to reduce frequent power \noutages. Entrepreneurial solutions to provide energy services to this \u201clow-end\u201d market segment \nhave not been promoted effectively despite higher-than-normal tariffs. A business model for \nprivate sector power development is needed that maximizes local ownership of energy assets in \npoorly served areas. \n \n5.  Prior ADB TA3 in the project area analyzed least-cost options for power expansion using \navailable  technologies  for  plants  as  small  as  90  MW.  Least-cost  analysis  concluded  that \nhydropower  is  the  least-cost  alternative  for  Zhangye.  For  further  expansion  of  generating \ncapacity, clean energy alternatives appear favorable, and new small hydropower plants and \nother clean energy projects are planned to improve service to poor and rural communities. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 26 June 2003. \n2  The Xiaogushan hydropower component of the Gansu Clean Energy Development Project (footnote 6) will add  \n98 MW generating capacity to the Zhangye grid. The Longshou Phase II Project, under construction, will add 142 \nMW generating capacity by 2005. A conceptual plan envisions five more hydropower stations upstream of the \nXiaogushan site, but no firm commitment exists to develop those sites. The 600 MW Pingliang coal-fired power \nplant is also scheduled for completion by 2007. \n3  ADB. 2001. Gansu Hydropower Project. Manila. ", "2 \n6.  ADB  has  provided  TA4  to  the  PRC  to  evaluate  energy  development  options  and \nstrategies to improve energy service delivery. Several barriers to clean energy and renewable \nenergy development have been identified, including the following:  \n \n(i)  Energy policy framework. Clean energy options appear to be economically and \nfinancially  attractive  in  many  cases,  but  no  formal  government  policy  directly \npromotes such projects.  \n \n(ii)  Lack of information about energy alternatives. Hydropower and other forms of \nrenewable energy are sometimes perceived to be too expensive or technologically \nunreliable. In local grids with large power deficits, demand-side management may be \noverlooked in favor of pursuing large generating plants.  \n \n(iii)  Market incentives. The energy service market is theoretically \u201copen\u201d with respect to \ngeneration, but new projects are subject to regulatory uncertainty due to ongoing \nrestructuring in the power sector. No specific market incentives are in place to \npromote energy services in poor and rural areas.  \n \n(iv)  Technology development and transfer. The full spectrum of energy technologies \nis  readily  available  in  the  PRC  and  Gansu,  but  entrepreneurial  technology \ndevelopment  firms  generally  focus  on  hardware  sales  rather  than  on  project \napplications.  \n \n(v)  Regulatory framework. No uniform contract model or operating record exists for \npower  purchase  and  sales  agreements  for  distributed  generation  and  industrial \ncogeneration. \n \n(vi)  Financing.  Large  generation  projects  receive  favorable  treatment  by  state \ncommercial banks because they are perceived to have low risk. Projects in poor and \nrural areas are not perceived as good business opportunities, and entrepreneurs \nworking in these markets have difficulty obtaining commercial financing.  \n \nB.  Clean Energy Alternatives \n \n7.  The poverty reduction benefits of improved energy services utilizing renewable energy \nand energy efficiency have been demonstrated in rural and remote areas where grid service is \nnonexistent or unreliable, and grid expansion would require unaffordable tariffs. In the proposed \nproject area, many customers receive either unreliable electricity supply or no supply at all. \nHydropower and other forms of renewable energy appear to be the most affordable option for \nproviding energy and electric service. Improving the reliability of electric service will have direct \nand  indirect  economic  benefits  to  poor  and  rural  areas.  Increased  use  of  more  efficient \nappliances with lower life-cycle costs (but higher purchase price) translates into direct financial \nbenefits for users, and increased use of electrical appliances in agro-processing will improve \nprocessing efficiency, increasing value-added outputs. Reduced time for protracted livelihood \nchores will increase time available for alternative income-generation activities. \n \n8.  Clean energy alternatives appear to be affordable and cost-effective in the project area. \nResidential tariffs in rural service areas of Gansu range from CNY0.54 to CNY1.00 per kilowatt-\nhour (kWh). Small hydropower (less than 100 MW) is cost-effective at a wholesale tariff of \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2002. Opportunities for Clean Development Mechanism in the Energy Sector. Manila; ADB. 1998. Technical \nAssistance Cluster for the Promotion of Clean Technology. Manila. ", "    3 \nCNY0.26 per kWh.5 The Zhangye and Hexi grid operating companies offer wholesale tariffs of \nCNY0.29 per kWh for hydropower and CNY0.35 per kWh for coal-fired power. Small-scale \ngeneration alternatives are estimated to cost from CNY0.58 per kWh for a 12 MW coal-fired \nplant, and CNY1.39 per kWh for diesel generator sets. Other renewable energy options cost \nabout CNY1.00 per kWh. To plan delivery of energy services in support of social development \nprograms in poor and rural areas of Zhangye, the Gansu provincial government requested a TA \nin association with the Gansu Clean Energy Development Project.6 \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  Consistent  with  ADB  energy,  environment,  and  poverty  reduction  policies,  the  TA\u2019s \ndevelopment  goal  is  to  improve  economic  and  social  welfare  of  poor  and  rural  areas  by \nimproving energy and electric service delivery in a sustainable manner. The TA objectives are to \n(i) assess least-cost options for supplying energy in underserved areas of Zhangye; (ii) assess \nwillingness to pay for, and affordability of, energy in poor and rural areas; and (iii) develop a \ncorresponding business plan that will optimize financial and economic benefits to poor and rural \ncustomers. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA has the following key activities:  \n \n(i)  Develop least-cost expansion options for the Gansu power network to determine \nthe need for new energy service investments to serve poor and rural customers. \n \n(ii)  Review  the  regulatory  framework  and  identify  barriers  to  energy  service \ndevelopment in poor and rural areas, and recommend ways to remove barriers to \nprivate sector participation, mobilize it, and maximize local ownership.  \n \n(iii)  Define technical, cost, and price parameters for construction and operation of \nenergy systems on a financially sustainable basis in poor and rural areas, taking \ninto account comparative advantages of energy-efficiency applications, small-\nscale hydropower, solar, wind, or other renewable resources. \n \n(iv)  Evaluate in detail at least two project proposals (from a long-list of up to 10 \ncandidate  projects)  based  on  local  demand,  expected  tariffs,  investment \nrequirements, financial return, and economic viability following ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor the Economic Analysis of Projects.  \n \n(v)  Identify  institutional  and  human  resource  requirements  for  a  self-sustaining \nenergy service organization that designs, builds, and operates energy service \nsystems in poor and rural areas. \n \n(vi)  Prepare  a business  plan  to  establish  a  commercial  energy  service  provider, \nincluding  (a)  legal  requirements  for  different  corporate  structures  (e.g., \nindependent power producer, energy service company, cooperative, not-for-profit \ncompany); (b) staffing, recruiting, and internal training; (c) market development; \n                                                 \n5  These estimates were developed for the Gansu Clean Energy Development Project (footnote 6). \n6  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu Clean Energy Development Project. Manila.  ", "4 \nand  (d)  financial  plan  including  capital  investment  plan;  financing  plan;  and \nfinancial  projections  (income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  cash  flow), \nconsidering tariff options and financial implications of the corporate structure \noptions. \n \n(vii)  Define indicators and mechanisms to monitor and quantify poverty reduction \nbenefits of the candidate investment projects. \n \n11.  The expected results and deliverables are the following: \n \n(i)  an  assessment  of  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency  potential  in \ndesignated poverty areas of the province; \n \n(ii)  definition of enabling requirements for commercial renewable energy and energy \nefficiency investments using different corporate/organizational approaches; \n \n(iii)  region-specific  proposals  for  new  renewable  energy  and  energy  efficiency \nprojects and services; \n \n(iv)  at least two project proposals developed for commercial investment, and other \npotential projects identified; \n \n(v)  an assessment of poverty reduction potential due to improved energy services \nusing renewable energy and energy efficiency; and \n \n(vi)  dissemination  and  discussion  of  study  findings  in  a  provincial  (or  national) \nseminar and via the Internet. \n \n12.  Candidate  project  selection  will  emphasize  \u201cground-up\u201d  renewable  energy \ncommercialization with local community development and ownership. The potential for financial \nsupport through sale of emission reduction credits will be explored. The TA will provide a \nbusiness plan to create commercial energy service organizations, using external funding as \nappropriate and necessary. Provision of the TA does not necessarily commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing projects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 equivalent, comprising $420,000 in \nforeign exchange, and $330,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost and $180,000 equivalent in local currency cost on a grant basis, \nwith $450,000 from the Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \nin Rural Areas, and $150,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining $150,000 equivalent in local currency cost. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  An international consulting firm or institute in association with a domestic consultant will \nbe  engaged  using  the  simplified  technical  proposal  procedures  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants. The quality- and cost-based selection procedure will be employed for \nrecruitment.  Indicative  terms  of  reference  for  the  consulting  services  are  in  Appendix  3.  ", "    5 \nThe consultants will procure equipment for pilot projects in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor Procurement. Equipment will be delivered to the Government at the conclusion of the TA. \n \n15.  The TA will be carried out over 12 months, from May 2004 to May 2005, with total input \nof international and domestic consultants of about 13 and 20 person-months, respectively. The \nTA will be implemented in two phases. Phase 1 will comprise review and analysis of power \nnetwork development plans, review of the regulatory framework and potential for private sector \nparticipation, determination of the need for new energy service provision to poor and rural \ncustomers, stakeholder consultations, and selection of projects for detailed evaluation. Phase 2 \nwill comprise detailed project evaluation. Procurement of hardware to operate village- and \nhousehold-scale pilot projects will be considered in consultation with the Government and local \nstakeholders.  \n \n16.  Project  reports  will  include  (i)  an  inception  report  submitted  within  1  month  of \nmobilization, summarizing results of initial review, evaluation, stakeholder consultations, and a \nlist of up to 10 candidate projects; (ii) an interim report to be submitted within 3 months of \nmobilization, including recommendations for detailed project analysis; (iii) a draft final report, to \nbe submitted within 11 months of mobilization; and (iv) a final report, to be submitted 12 months \nafter mobilization. Monthly progress reports will be submitted to ADB using a standard two-page \nTA report format.  \n \n17.  The Gansu provincial government will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and the \nZhangye City government will be the Implementing Agency. The Gansu provincial government, \nin consultation with ADB, will assign a project leader and counterpart staff to work on the \nproject; and identify and establish a TA steering committee, with representatives from relevant \ngovernment  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  other  stakeholders.  The  steering \ncommittee  will  be  chaired  by  the  Gansu  provincial  government.  Local  participation  will  be \nassured by appointing local government representatives. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy \nEfficiency in Rural Areas, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$150,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Renewable \nEnergy for Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \n       \nA.
