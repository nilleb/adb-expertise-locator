Nepal has undergone many years of political turmoil, including an armed conflict that \nended in 2006, but is now on a path to political stability and economic recovery. Agriculture \ncontributed  27.0%  to  gross  domestic  product  in  2019  (second  only  to  services),  and  has \ncontributed to the recovery through largely inclusive growth: the national poverty rate has declined \nfrom 25.2% in FY2011 to an estimated 18.7% in FY2018.1 However, Nepal remains one of the \npoorest  countries  in  Asia,  with  gross  domestic  product  per  capita  of  $993.9  in  FY2018.2 \nAgriculture continues to engage 55% of Nepalese above 15 years of age, and a disproportionate \nshare (61%) of women.3 Furthermore, 48% produce only for their own consumption, with less \nthan 10% farming exclusively for sale. Nepal has diverse agro-climatic conditions suitable for \nhigh-value and off-season production, and has identified several agro-based commodities with \nhigh export potential (e.g., cardamom, tea, ginger, and medicinal and aromatic plants).4 However, \nNepal has been unable to capitalize on these opportunities because of underlying policy and \ninstitutional  bottlenecks.  Nepal\u2019s  recent  transition  to  federalism  has  devolved  much  of  the \nmandate related to agriculture to subnational governments; policy, legislative and institutional \nreforms are needed to realign agricultural public service delivery.  \n \n2.  The program will provide budget support for reforms to (i) improve food safety and quality \nmonitoring systems that will reduce transaction time and costs for exporters, and protect public \nhealth from unsafe food consumption; (ii) promote agriculture commercialization to support \nfarmers in their transition from subsistence farming to profit-making production and sales; and (iii) \nstrengthen institutional capacity, particularly at the subnational government level. The program \nwill also support Nepal\u2019s agriculture sector with required policy and regulatory amendments as \nthe country transitions from a unitary to a federal structure. The government has requested a \nconcessional loan of $50 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance \nthe program, which will be released in two equal tranches, one at project effectiveness, and the \nsecond about 18 months following project effectiveness.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) is being processed at the request of \nthe  Government  of  Nepal  to  facilitate  program  implementation.  The  TA  will  support  the \nimplementing agencies to prepare the policy actions required to comply with the program\u2019s \nsecond tranche conditions. The recent transition to federalism has resulted in the reorganization \nof responsibilities among the three tiers of the government and the creation of new institutions to \ndeliver public services related to agriculture. A key issue at present is the weak coordination \namong the three tiers of the government and among the various institutions. Fulfillment of their \nnew responsibilities is also constrained by inadequate staffing levels within these institutions. The \n \n1  Government of Nepal, Ministry of Finance. Economic Survey 2018\u20122019 (in Nepali). Kathmandu. The figure for \nFY2018 is an estimate; actual poverty rates will be determined after the next National Living Standards Survey, which \nis likely to be completed in 2020. \n2  Government of Nepal, Central Bureau of Statistics. 2019.

In addition to those formally or informally \u201cemployed\u201d, the survey also reports on \u201cother forms of work\u201d, \nincluding producing and/or processing of agricultural products for own use. A total of 11.4 million (55%) Nepalese \nover 15 years of age are involved in subsistence foodstuff production, including 61.3% of women 47.2% of men. \nWhile 21.5% of the population were \u201cemployed\u201d in agriculture, forestry, and fishing, only 1.3% of these were in formal \nemployment. \n4  Government of Nepal, Ministry of Commerce. 2016.

The public sector\u2019s regulatory function for ensuring food \nquality and safety will also be strengthened.  \n \n4.  The  results  framework,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimate,  and  terms  of \nreference of key consultants were discussed with the Government of Nepal during the fact-finding \nmission and was finalized during the loan negotiations mission. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n5.  Output  1:  Agribusiness  advisory  services  delivered.  The  TA  will  support  the \ngovernment  in  (i)  preparing  sample  business  plan  templates  for  at  least  two  high-value \ncommodities; (ii) preparing a sample business plan template and operational guidelines for \ncustom hiring of agricultural machinery; (iii) preparing a training manual for promotion of inclusive \nagriculture and agribusiness, and delivering training (ensuring at least 50% of participants are \nwomen, and that indigenous peoples are informed and represented in the training); (iv) preparing \nsocially and gender-inclusive provincial strategic investment plans for prioritized commodities; (v) \nfacilitating orientation on the ADB-assisted Agricultural Development Strategy (ADS), 2015\u20122035, \nto local levels5 of Gandaki Province, including orientation on the flagship program and gender \nequality  and  social  inclusion  strategy  of  the  ADS;  (vi)  drafting  terms  of  reference  for \nmainstreaming gender and social inclusion in the operations of the Ministry of Land Management, \nAgriculture, and Cooperatives; (vii) organizing various capacity building programs for government \nstaff; and (viii) undertaking any other activity needed to comply with the second-tranche actions.6 \n \n6.  Output  2:  Government  regulatory  capacity  improved.  The  TA  will  support  the \ngovernment  in  (i)  developing  minimum  national  standards  for  establishing  seed  testing \nlaboratories at national and subnational levels; (ii) drafting plant protection regulations; (iii) drafting \npesticide management regulations; (iv) developing maximum residue levels of pesticides for at \nleast ten priority food items; (v) developing a pesticide residue surveillance protocol and an \noperational plan for two priority commodities; (vi) preparing a plan for upgrading existing and \nestablishing new food safety laboratories under the Department of Food Technology and Quality \nControl;  (vii)  completing  all  pre-requisites  for  International  Organization  for \nStandardization/International  Electrotechnical  Commission  (ISO/IEC)  17025  certification  for \npyrophytes  and  carbamates  pesticides  testing  at  the  Central  Food  and  Feed  Reference \nLaboratory;7 (viii) completing all pre-requisites for ISO/IEC 17025 certification of molecular unit in \nthe Central Veterinary Laboratory; (ix) completing all pre-requisites for ISO/IEC 17025 certification \nfor newcastle disease and Peste des Petits Ruminants vaccine production units of the National \nVaccine Production Laboratory; and (x) organizing capacity building programs for government \nstaff.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n7.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $600,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are \nlisted in Appendix 1.  \n \n5  Local levels mean urban and rural municipalities. \n6  The Farmers\u2019 Commission, farmers groups and cooperatives will be consulted in preparing the sample business \nplans and guidelines. \n7  ISO/IEC 17025 is the main ISO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories; most laboratories must hold \naccreditation to this standard to be deemed technically competent. At least one unit among pyrethroid and carbamate \npesticide group testing units in the National Food and Feed Reference Laboratory will be considered for certification. \n ", "3 \n8.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other in-kind contributions. The government was informed that the approval \nof the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB\u2019s Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture \nDivision under the South Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and \nprocure goods. A total of 4 person-months of international and 35.5 person-months of national \nconsultancy services will be required intermittently. The transaction TA is estimated to begin in \nMarch 2020 and will be implemented over 15 months until June 2021. Transaction TA consultants \nwill provide support to the proposed implementing agencies for the program.
