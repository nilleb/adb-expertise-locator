THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed project will reduce the risks of landslide events in Kyrgyz Republic. The \nproject will take a comprehensive approach combining structural (including civil works and \nequipment) and non-structural (including disaster risk financing and insurance, training, strategy, \nand policy) interventions. The project is expected to comprise three outputs: (i) landslide-prone \nareas protected; (ii) landslide risk management capacity improved; and (iii) disaster risk financing \nand insurance coverage strengthened. The project outcome is expected to be: exposure and \nvulnerability of infrastructure and settlements to landslides reduced. The project is expected to be \naligned  with  the  following  impact:  human  and  material  loss  resulting  from  climate-  and \ngeophysical-related disasters reduced.1 \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) and the ensuing loan are included in ADB\u2019s \nKyrgyz Republic Country Operations Business Plan 2019\u20132021 of October 2018.2 The total \npreliminary project cost is $40 million, of which $35 million is currently expected to be financed by \nADB comprising a $25 million concessional ordinary capital resources loan and $10 million Asian \nDevelopment Fund grant.3 The government\u2019s contribution is initially estimated at $5.0 million \nequivalent. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n3.  The TRTA will help the government to design and prepare the project, including: (i) \ndeveloping the underlying landslide risk reduction framework; and (ii) preparing the feasibility \nstudy of the investment project.4 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n4.  Output 1: Landslide risk reduction framework developed. The underlying framework \nof landslide risk reduction activities for the ensuing project will be prepared. This will include: (i) \ncapacity  and  needs  assessment  of  the  key  stakeholders  and  poverty,  social,  and  gender \nassessment with sex-disaggregated data; (ii) methodology for area landslide risk assessment and \nsubproject site selection incorporating earth observation and other advanced technologies; (iii) \nclimate change and seismic risk assessment in project areas; (iv) scope and plan of project \ninterventions for landslide risk reduction expected to include risk management plans, monitoring \nand early warning systems, slope stabilization and other protective infrastructure; and (v) scope \nand  plan  for  prospective  disaster  insurance/financing  mechanisms.  The  TRTA  will  explore \nopportunities  for  community-led  approaches  and/or  participation  in  capacity  building  and \ninvestment activities. \n \n5.  Output 2: Preparation of investment project. This output will (i) apply the risk reduction \nmethodology to develop short-list of investment subprojects and select representative subproject; \n(ii) conduct topographic and geographic surveys; (iii) prepare feasibility-level structural design for \n                                                \n1  Government of the Kyrgyz Republic. 2018.
