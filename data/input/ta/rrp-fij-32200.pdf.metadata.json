The  Project  will  support  improved  water  supply  and \nsewerage management and operations, improved environmental \nmonitoring  related  to  water  supply  and  sewerage  operations, \ndevelopment  and  implementation  of  trade  waste  policies  and \nprocedures, conduct of public awareness campaigns, and a tariff \nstudy. It will also provide support for the creation of a water and \nsewerage department (WSD) followed by the creation of a water \nand  sewerage  corporation  (WSC)  with  arrangements  for \ngovernance similar to those of a commercial water and sewerage \nagency. \n   \nRationale  The Fiji Island\u2019s principal urban areas suffer from deficiencies in \ntheir water supply and sewerage systems, to the extent that their \neconomic and social development is being hindered and their \nenvironments are being adversely affected. Water shortages in \nthe Suva\u2013Nausori urban area are having an increasingly harmful \neffect on the local economy. No new connections are being given, \nwhich  has  effectively  halted  new  land  development.  Many \nlocalities are not served by a piped sewerage system. Local land \nzoning  regulations  place  restrictions  on  the  density  of \ndevelopment  in  unsewered  urban  areas.  Lack  of  sewerage  is \nholding back development and causing gross pollution in several \nlocalities. \n \nThe Fiji Island\u2019s water supply and sewerage services\u2014currently \nprovided  by  the  Public  Works  Department  (PWD),  which  is \nresponsible  also  for  roads,  buildings,  and  mechanical  and \nelectrical services\u2014are suffering from ineffective management, a \nlack  of  maintenance,  and  shortages  of  funds.  Water  losses \nbetween  production  and  consumption  average  55%,  and  tariff \ncollections average only 60% of billings.  The Government of the \nRepublic of the Fiji Islands has provided financial support, but it is \nnow inadequate to carry out needed repairs and replacements. \nThere is a need to establish a department focused on water and \nsewerage operations, with the potential to be converted into a ", "iv   \ncommercial corporation, based on the principles of a strong client \norientation, an awareness of the value of water and sewerage \nservices, an ability to collect and retain revenues fully covering the \ncost of the services provided, and transparency and accountability \nin its operations. \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The Project will address the need for improved water supply and \nsanitation  services  in  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area.  It  will  improve \nenvironmental conditions throughout the area, including in low \ncost  and  squatter  housing  areas.  The  Project  will  also  help \nenhance  the  long-term  sustainability  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage services through supporting implementation of more \neffective  policies  and  institutional  arrangements  as  well  as \nproviding investment for the development of these services.   \nThe  Project\u2019s  physical  works  comprise  the  most  urgent  and \nimmediate investment needs, as identified in master plans for \nwater supply and sewerage development in the Suva\u2013Nausori \narea. \n \nProject outputs will include: (i) improvement of the coverage and \nquality  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  in  the  Suva\u2013\nNausori  area;  (ii)  improvement  of  the  adverse  environmental \nconditions  that  have  been  caused  by  inadequate  sewerage \nservices; and (iii) establishment of WSD/WSC for provision of \nwater supply and sewerage services in the country\u2019s metered \nwater  supply  areas,  with  arrangements  for  autonomy, \ntransparency, and accountability similar to those of a commercial \nwater and sewerage corporation. \n \nProject activities will include: (i) rehabilitation and augmentation of \nwater  supply  networks,  water  treatment,  and  water  storage \nfacilities;  (ii)  rehabilitation  and  augmentation  of  sewerage \nnetworks and sewage treatment facilities; (iii) development of a \nnew  source  of  water  supply;  (iv)  establishment  of  stronger \nenvironmental  management  procedures;  and  institutional \ndevelopment of the proposed WSD/WSC, particularly in the fields \nof management, accounting and financial operations, operation \nand  maintenance  of  water  supply  and  sewerage  facilities, \nenvironmental management, and customer relations. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$72.4  million \nequivalent, of which foreign exchange costs amount to US$48.0 \nmillion equivalent (66% including US$4.7 million for commitment \ncharges, front-end fee, and interest during construction). \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide US$47.0 million \nfor the Project. The Government will finance the balance of the \ncosts. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of US$47.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources \nwill  be  provided  under  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate ", "  v\n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term \nincluding a grace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, a front-end fee of 0.5% \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft Loan \nAgreement. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Executing Agency will establish a project management unit \nArrangements  (PMU) for works and a PMU for reforms. The Government will \ncreate a project steering committee as a subcommittee of the \nexisting capital works committee. \n   \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Works and Energy will be the Executing Agency \nand WSD/WSC will be the Implementing Agency for the Project.   \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  under  Asian  Development \nBank Loans. The principal civil works, equipment, and materials \ncontracts will be awarded through ADB\u2019s international competitive \nbidding  procedures.  At  present,  nine  international  competitive \nbidding procurement packages are proposed, but this number \nmay be reduced, depending upon considerations of economy and \nefficiency.  Small  contracts  not  exceeding  US$2.0  million  for \nconstruction and rehabilitation of pipelines in built-up areas and \nfor  minor  construction  works  will  be  awarded  through  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. International \nshopping will be used for procurement of equipment and materials \nin small contracts of less than US$500,000.  Some small works \n(such as for replacement of consumer water meters, installation of \nsmall service pipes, and leakage detection and repairs) may be \ncarried out under force account procedures acceptable to ADB. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting services will be provided in several packages for (i) \nproject management-works; (ii) project management-reforms; (iii) \nwater  loss  reduction,  wastewater  inflow/infiltration  assessment, \nmapping, environmental monitoring and computerization; and (iv) \ndetailed design and construction supervision. Packages (ii) and \n(iii) will be funded by ADB and packages (i) and (iv) will be funded \nby  the  Government.  The  consultants  for  package  (i)  will  be \nselected as individuals, and the consultants for packages (ii), (iii), \nand  (iv)  will  be  selected  as  firms.  For  packages  (ii)  and  (iii), \nconsultants will be selected as firms by the Executing Agency \nusing the quality- and cost-based process in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development \nBank and its Borrowers. For package (i), it has been agreed that \ninternational  consultants  will  be  selected  in  a  process  in ", "vi   \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants by the \nAsian  Development  Bank  and  its  Borrowers.  Package  (iv) \nrecruitment  is  under  way.  Suitably  qualified  and  experienced \nconsultants are being selected by the Executing Agency through a \nprocess  of  international  quality-  and  cost-based  selection, \nacceptable to ADB. A total of 825 person-months of consulting \nservices  will  be  required,  comprising  615  person-months  of \ninternational  consulting  services  and  210  person-months  of \ndomestic consulting services. \n \nAdvance Action and  Advance  action  financing  will  be  provided  for  recruitment  of \nRetroactive Financing  urgently needed consultants and for procurement of civil works \nand  supply  of  equipment  and  materials  of  urgent  water  loss \nreduction activities begun after 1 January 2004 in an amount not \nexceeding  US$1.0  million  equivalent.  Retroactive  financing  for \nwater  loss  reduction  activities  require  prior  approval  of  ADB. \nAdvance action for civil works, equipment and materials for other \nurgently needed water system rehabilitation and augmentation \nworks will also be provided. \n \nProject Benefits and  There  are  high  socioeconomic,  economic,  and  environmental \nBeneficiaries  benefits  associated  with  the  Project.  The  beneficiaries  of  the \nProject\u2019s institutional development components will comprise the \n450,000 inhabitants of the country\u2019s metered water supply areas. \nThe beneficiaries of the Project\u2019s physical components will be the \nmore than 262,000 residents of the Suva\u2013Nausori area, more \nthan 27% of whom live on or below the poverty line, and industries \nand commercial enterprises within the Suva\u2013Nausori area.  \n \nWithin  the  Suva\u2013Nausori  area,  the  rehabilitation  and \naugmentation of water supply facilities will eliminate the acute \nwater shortages that have been experienced in recent years, and \nwill remove a major constraint to economic growth.  \n \nThe sewerage components of the Project will alleviate serious \npollution of streams, drains, and coastal waters, and alleviate \nunhealthy conditions in low income and squatter areas. \n \nNationally,  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  establishment  of  an \nefficient, autonomous water supply and sewerage agency that will \nprovide effective and sustainable services for the future. \n \nCost recovery will be improved through a commercial approach to \nmanagement, and costs will be reduced through water loss/inflow \nand infiltration reduction.  Methods of increasing tariff revenues \nhave been discussed, and a tariff study is provided under the \nassociated technical assistance (TA) to assess alternatives and \nprepare detailed proposals. It has been agreed that WSD/WSC \nwill recover, by 2006, the costs of operations, maintenance and \ndebt service and by 2012, the costs of operation, maintenance, \ndepreciation, and interest. To achieve the 2006 target will require ", "  vii \nonly a modest tariff increase of about 25%. However, to achieve \nthe 2012 target will require further tariff increases of about 70%. It \nis understood that tariff increases will be undertaken as services \nimprove, and will be designed to ensure that the services provided \nremain affordable for all population groups. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  main  risk  is  that  the  institutional  reforms,  including  the \nrestructuring  of  PWD\u2019s  water  and  sewerage  services  into  a \ndepartment, and the subsequent establishment of a commercially \noperated  water  and  sewerage  corporation,  will  be  delayed  or \nineffective, and not result in the expected improvements in water \nand sewerage operations. A related risk is that cost recovery will \nbe insufficient to ensure the sustainable provision of water and \nsewerage services.  Another risk is that environmental conditions \nmay not improve, despite the investments made in the Project, \ndue  to  continued  discharge  of  sewage  by  those  without \nconnections. However, the Government is strongly committed to \nthe  Project,  which  will  be  implemented  in  accordance  with \noperational output targets reflected in assurances, and they will be \nclosely monitored during project implementation. \n   \nTechnical Assistance  The Government has requested an associated TA for capacity \nbuilding  in  the  provision  of  water  supply,  sewerage,  and \nenvironmental  services.  The  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at \nUS$978,000 comprising a foreign exchange cost of US$661,000 \nand a local currency cost of US$317,000. ADB, through its TA \nfunding program, will finance US$783,000 on a grant basis. The \nobjectives of the TA are to (i) build capacity in the fields of trade \nwaste  management,  environmental  management,  health  and \nsafety procedures, community education and awareness; and to \n(ii) enhance cost recovery from customers through a tariff study \nthat will identify the costs of various water supply and sewerage \nservices and identify efficient, effective, and affordable changes in \nthe  tariff  structure.  The  TA  will  complement  capacity-building \nmeasures that are to be financed through the loan. Consultants \nengaged  under  the  TA  will  be  selected  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by the Asian Development \nBank and its Borrowers. ", " ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Fiji Islands for the Suva-Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project. \nThe report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building in the \nProvision of Water Supply and Sewerage Services, and if the Board approves the loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  The urban water supply and sewerage systems of the Fiji Islands, which were well \ndeveloped in the 1970s and 1980s, have not kept pace with demand and have suffered from \ndeferred maintenance. Despite an ambitious capital investment program carried out over the \nlast several years, deficiencies are widespread. Table 1 illustrates the extent and causes of \ndeficiencies in the water supply and sewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area. \n \nTable 1: Analysis of Water Supply and Sewerage Services Performance \nIndicator  Current Situation and Performance \nPoverty \nUrban poverty  Current estimates indicate that more than 27% of the 262,000 people who live in the \nSuva\u2013Nausori urban area subsist below the poverty line. \nWater Supply Indicators \nService   About 243,000 persons, or 93% of the population of the Suva\u2013Nausori area, have \ndirect connections to piped water supplies.a Although the water supplied is in most \ncases potable, disruptions of service are frequent, and cause considerable hardship. \nWater users who lack connections either get their water from a neighbor\u2019s tap or \ndepend upon wells and streams. While some wells are of good quality, many are \nbadly polluted, particularly in low-lying areas.  \nSupply disruptions and  During the early 1990s, disruptions occurred during \u201cdrought\u201d years. By the mid-\ndeficiencies  1990s, disruptions occurred during the drier periods of each year. Now, they occur \nduring all periods of the year.  Provision of water by tank truck, with storage in plastic \ntanks, which is very expensive, has become common. \nUnaccounted-for water  Unaccounted-for waterb has increased from about 30% of water supplied in the early \n1990s to about 55% of water supplied in 2003. It comprises losses of water recorded \nas delivered to consumers due to physical leakages, or inaccurate or missing meters.  \nLeakages  Leakages  occur  in  house  connections,  distribution  system,  reservoirs,  pumping \nstations,  and  transmission  mains.  An  ongoing  leak  detection  survey  shows \nconsiderable losses throughout the system, including in transmission mains, many of \nwhich are old and in need of replacement.  \nGastroenteric disease  During 1995-2000, 10,000 cases of diarrhea were reported in the Suva\u2013Nausori area, \nmost among infants and in areas where piped water is not available or the quality of \npiped water is compromised. \nSewerage Indicators \nSewerage coverage  About 71,000 persons, or about 27% of the population of the Suva\u2013Nausori area, \nhave access to a sewerage system. Most of the remainder are connected to septic \ntanks and some lack sewerage altogether.  Sewage effluent flows to streams and \ncoastal waters. High-density development is banned in areas without sewers, causing \ndevelopment to spread out, and increasing the demand for water. \nPollution of natural waters  Levels of indicator bacteria in streams and coastal waters demonstrate that many \nwaters are unsuitable for contact activities. As these waters are used for fishing and \nshellfish gathering, they are a potential health risk. ", "2 \nIndicator  Current Situation and Performance \nOverflows from the  Most of Suva\u2019s 71 pumping stations overflow frequently, due to inflow of groundwater \nsewerage system  to sewers, together with blocked sewers, broken exposed mains, and sewage pump \nbreakdowns.  \nInstitutional Indicators \nOrganization and  Urban water supply and sewerage systems are developed and managed by the \nmanagement  Water Supply and Sewerage Section of the Public Works Department (PWD) of the \nMinistry of Works and Energy. Management of the section is not substantially \nconcerned with water losses or cost recovery. Response times to problems are long. \nOutside the Suva\u2013Nausori area, even maintenance is shared with other sections of \nPWD. \nHuman resources  PWD  has  a  shortage  of  personnel  with  appropriate  managerial,  financial,  and \ntechnical qualifications and experience. \nFinancial Indicators \nFlow of funds  PWD is  responsible for billing and collection. Revenues are turned over to the \nGovernment\u2019s consolidated fund and PWD is in turn financed through government \nbudgetary  allocation.  There  is  little  incentive  for  PWD  to  improve  its  financial \nefficiency. \nRevenues  Revenues are presently insufficient to meet even cash operating costs. \nBilling and collection  Collections efficiency is about 60% of potential revenues. \nAccounts receivable are currently about 300 days of sales. \na  Based upon a household size of 4.6 persons per connection. Some sources put the proportion of the population \nwith direct connections as low as 86%. Although the 2002 household income and expenditure survey of urban \nhouseholds put the proportion of the population in the Suva\u2013Nausori region with some form of access to piped \nwater supply at 97%, it may have underestimated the rural population in the water supply system service area. \nb  Defined here as the difference between water used in production as measured by meters at the treatment plant \noutlet and water provided to consumers as measured by meters at the point of consumption.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Problems and Opportunities \n3.  The Suva\u2013Nausori water supply distribution system, on which the physical works of the \nProject are centered, requires improvements from the source to the consumer tap. Consumers \nthroughout the service area, particularly those living at high elevations, in locations distant from \nthe treatment plants, and in slum and squatter areas, are suffering from frequent service \ninterruptions.  Substantial  leakages  are  occurring  throughout  the  system,  including  in \ntransmission lines, distribution lines, and reticulation systems. Administrative losses result from \nunder-registration of meters and unauthorized connections. Physical losses can be reduced \nthrough rehabilitation works and both types of losses, physical and administrative, can be \nreduced through better management. The existing water intake at Waila on the Rewa River is \nsubject to saltwater intrusion  during the dry season. The two water treatment plants require \nrehabilitation to achieve optimal treatment levels, particularly in the areas of backwash facilities, \ninstrumentation, and chemical dosing. There is also the potential to increase water production \nthrough  process  improvements.  The  water  transmission  and  distribution  systems  require \noptimization to better distribute the produced water to service areas in relation to relative \ndemand. There is a need to decrease the loading on the Tamavua water treatment plant, which \nis currently operating at twice its design capacity, and to increase the loading on the Waila water \ntreatment plant, which has recently been augmented and is operating substantially under its \ndesign capacity. Elimination of leakages in the distribution system will enable better services to \nbe provided to the present and future population of the area and help minimize increases in \ntreatment plant capacity. Illegal connections are substantial and should be eliminated. Improved ", "3 \nmetering of consumers, of supply areas, and of water intakes will help in leakage reduction. \nEnhanced  and  expanded  system  instrumentation  will  enable  better  coordination  and \nmanagement of supplies, particularly during times of shortages. There is a need to enhance \nwater supplies to better service both existing and new consumers.1  \n \n4.  The  wastewater  collection  and  treatment  system  faces  similar  needs.  The  Kinoya \nsewage treatment plant currently has nearly 40% excess capacity for dry weather flows when \ninflows and infiltration (I&I) are at reasonable levels; however, even high tide results in higher \nflow and salinity levels, which reduce treatment efficiency. In the central Suva area, anecdotal \nevidence suggests I&I as high as 90% in wet weather. I&I also means  exfiltration, that is, \nsubstantial raw sewage is discharged to the environment.  This together with frequent overflows \nfrom deteriorated pump stations, and blocked and broken sewer mains, has resulted in serious \npollution of the urban water environment.  Rehabilitation of these facilities will allow the current \nsystem to achieve its desired environmental and public health benefits and allow connection of \na larger percentage of the population, further improving the environment and taking advantage \nof the capacity of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant. The Kinoya sewage treatment plant, \nwhich  includes  an  older  trickling  filter  system  for  secondary  treatment  as  well  as  a  new \nsequencing batch reactor, generally operates effectively and achieves international wastewater \ndischarge quality standards, but its capacity is limited by the inlet works. Odor control problems \nalso occur. Sludge treatment and disposal facilities are inadequate. Improved instrumentation of \nthe sewage treatment plant will allow overall treatment efficiency improvements and efficient \nbalancing between the trickling filter and sequencing batch reactor plant.  \n \n5.  The underlying problems of delivery of water supply and sewerage are often described \nas shortages of water in reservoirs and lack of finance. These problems exist, but they are not \nthe fundamental problems. Water resources in the area are abundant, and the Government  has \npoured substantial financial resources into capital works. Nevertheless, the works have not \nhelped improve services as expected because of operational shortcomings.  \n \n6.  Under  the  present  institutional  arrangements,  senior  staff  of  the  Public  Works \nDepartment (PWD) are responsible not only for water supply and sewerage but also roads, \nbuildings, and mechanical and electrical works; management information systems are more \nfocused on capital works than on operations or finances; and operations are bound up in \nbureaucracy. High unaccounted-for water (UFW) in the water supply system and high I&I in the \nsewerage system lead to unnecessarily high treatment plant, distribution, and collection system \ncosts. The practice of permitting nonpaying customers, to remain connected reduces revenues, \nand the gap between costs and revenues prevents the mobilization of the financial resources \nneeded for better asset management. Shortages of senior staff lead to substantial use of \nconsultants in line positions and result in management deficiencies. \n \n7.  Achievement  of  the  urgently  needed  service  delivery  improvements  and  the \nsustainability of these improvements require concurrent management and institutional reforms. \nThe Government\u2019s Strategic Plan 2003-2005 and PWD\u2019s Corporate Plan for 2002 lay out a \nframework for moving ahead. The Strategic Plan provides for corporatization of water and \nsewerage services by 2005. Within this framework, PWD\u2019s Corporate Plan points out the need \nfor creating an entity separate from other public works responsibilities to provide for better \nmanagement and improved delivery of water supply and sewerage services. It proposes the \nreorganization of the water and sewerage section of PWD into an autonomous water and \n                                                 \n1 Supplementary Appendix A includes a demand assessment for water supply and the sewerage collection and \ntreatment system. ", "4 \nsewerage corporation (WSC). The Government and staff of the Ministry of Works and Energy \n(MWE) have underlined the need to plan carefully for the transition. Underlying concerns include \nthe need to maintain the present high level of accessibility to services, to avoid any harmful \nimpacts on the poor, to retrain and redeploy staff rather than make them redundant, and to \navoid substantial tariff increases until services can be improved. To minimize unexpected \nimpacts, the transition from a water and sewerage department (WSD) to a WSC is being \nphased.  \n \n8.  It is clear that the overall institutional framework for the water supply and sewerage \nsector needs improvement. Steps are being taken to create a water policy, and to strengthen \ncontrols over wastewater discharges through a public health and pollution control bill and a \nsustainable development bill. However, both bills have been under consideration for some time.   \nNo matter how strong the bills, administrative capacity to monitor water quality and control \nharmful waste discharges will continue to be limited. Nevertheless, it is important for the welfare \nof the country\u2019s urban population and the sustainability of its natural environment that the bills \nbe finalized and passed as soon as possible. A sector road map, which has been discussed and \nagreed upon in principle with the Government, is in Supplementary Appendix B. Appendix 1 \nsummary sector analysis links sector issues and project to ADB country strategy, ADB\u2019s water \npolicy, and Government development goals. \n \n2.  Lessons Learned \n9.  The main lessons learned in similar projects in the Fiji Islands and throughout the Pacific \ninclude the need to (i) address institutional reforms including broad sector reforms as a part of \nthe project, to ensure achievement of project service delivery objectives; (ii) provide for careful \ndesign and sequencing of institutional and financial arrangements; and (iii) plan for and mitigate \nundesirable  outcomes;  clearly  identify  arrangements  for  procurement,  in  particular  for \ncontracting versus force account works, to avoid ambiguity during implementation; and ensure \nadequate counterpart funding to carry out the project on schedule. Generally, counterpart staff \nhave been suitably experienced and qualified for their assignments. Appendix 2 lists recent and \ncurrent external assistance in this sector to the Fiji Islands. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n10.  The Project will contribute to the long-term goal of improving the delivery of urban water \nsupply and sewerage services in the Fiji Islands. The objectives of the Project are to (i) increase \ndelivery of safe water supply and sewerage services in the Suva\u2013Nausori area through  physical \nand institutional improvements, and (ii) enhance the sustainability of water supply and sewerage \nservices throughout the Fiji Islands by means of appropriate institutional reforms.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n11.  The Project\u2019s outputs will include: (i) increased supply, delivery, and potable water \nreliability in the Suva\u2013Nausori area; (ii) reduction in UFW; (iii) rehabilitated wastewater collection \nand treatment system; (iv) improvement in the adverse environmental conditions that have been \ncaused  by  inadequate  sewerage  services;  (v)  strengthened  institutions  and  legislative \nframeworks  for  wastewater  management  and  environmental  management;  and  (vi) \nestablishment of an entity dedicated to provision of water supply and sewerage services in \nmetered water supply areas, operated in manner similar to those of a commercial water supply ", "5 \nand sewerage agency. The Project works are part of a water and sewerage master plan \ndeveloped through ADB assistance.2 The  Project  Framework (Appendix 3) includes specific \ntargets for the outputs. \n12.  The Project is divided into two parts, one for construction of water supply and sewerage \nfacilities and one for institutional reforms and development. The first component (Part A) is \ndivided into Part A1 (water supply) and Part A2 (sewerage works). The second component (Part \nB) is the institutional reform program that provides assistance for the transition of the water and \nsewerage division of PWD to an effective independent utility agency.  \n \n1.  Component A: Water Supply and Sewerage \n13.  The water supply component of the Project includes: (i) implementation of a program for \nwater loss reduction comprising leak detection, replacement of about 50 kilometers (km) of \nleaking distribution mains, replacement of about 15,000 leaking service pipes and 27,000 \nmalfunctioning meters, rehabilitation of the Tamavua main storage reservoirs and the Upper \nWaimanu  pumping  station,  and  a  demand  management  program;  (ii)  optimization  and \naugmentation  of  the  distribution  system  comprising  installation  and  upgrading  of  pumping \nstations in four locations, construction of additional service, storage, and balance reservoirs with \na capacity of about 29 megaliters (ml), construction of about 40 km of additional mains, and \ninstallation  of  about  13,000  new  house  connections;  (iii)  augmentation  of  water  sources, \nincluding construction of a new water supply intake and pumping station on the Rewa River, and \nconstruction  of  about  11  km  of  new  source  and  rising  mains  and  related  pump  station \nimprovements; (iv) augmentation of existing water treatment plants, including rehabilitation of \nmechanical facilities in the Tamavua treatment plant, construction of a new clear water reservoir \nat Waila, upgrading and installation of instrumentation systems, construction and upgrading of \nsludge and backwash facilities at Waila and Tamavua, and upgrading laboratory facilities; and \n(v) detailed design and construction supervision. Emphasis is placed on distribution network \nrehabilitation  and  development  and  implementation  of  a  strong  UFW  reduction  program. \nComponents such as meter testing, meter replacement, service pipe replacement are included \nin the Project, even though they involve numerous small works, because they are essential to \nthe UFW reduction program. \n14.  The sewerage and sewage treatment component of the Project includes: (i) rehabilitation \nand upgrading of existing collection networks, including I&I rehabilitation works, comprising \nrehabilitation and replacement of about 8 km of trunk mains, gravity mains, rising mains, and \npump stations; (ii) improvement of the Kinoya sewage treatment plant, including inlet works, \nodor control and sludge treatment, dewatering and disposal systems; (iii) construction of about \n15 km of new trunk sewer mains, collectors and reticulation, with related pumping stations; \ninstallation  of  about  6,300  new  sewerage  connections  in  backlog  areas  and  in  presently \nunserved areas; (iv) design and implementation of a trade wastewater program; (v) upgrading of \nmaintenance  facilities  and  the  existing  national  water  quality  laboratory  at  Kinoya;  (vi) \ndevelopment and implementation of improved management systems, including mapping and \ngeographic information systems, receiving water quality monitoring, and infiltration assessment \nand related design; and (vii) detailed design and construction supervision.  Emphasis  is  placed \non rehabilitation works, addressing I&I issues as well as the trade wastewater management \nprogram. New service connections are included in the Project because they are essential to the \ndelivery  of  the  Project\u2019s  outputs.  As  with  the  water  supply  component,  installation  of  a \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1998. Suva-Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project. Manila. ", "6 \nsupervisory data control and data acquisition system is already underway and so it is excluded \nfrom the project. \n \n2.  Component B: Institutional Reform and Development \n15.  The  institutional  reform  and  development  component  of  the  Project,  includes  (i) \nimplementation of an institutional reform action plan (IRAP) (Appendix 4) and a financial action \nplan (Appendix 5) aimed at creating a WSC by 2005; (ii) implementation of a management \ninformation reporting system facilitating well-integrated, effective and efficient water supply and \nsanitation operations; (iii) implementation of an accounting system for WSD that provides data \non costs and revenues, by district, by month, and for WSC that provides data as required for \ncommercial operations; (iv) implementation of agreed recommendations from the tariff study \ncompleted under the TA associated with the loan; (v) improvement of operations, including \nprovision of consumer services and metering, adoption of water loss reduction and I&I reduction \nprograms, and mechanizing water and sewage treatment operations; (vi) upgrading of human \nresource  management  systems;  (vii)  strengthening  of  environmental  monitoring  and \nenvironmental  management  systems;  (viii)  upgrading  of  computerized  information  systems \nthrough  the  provision  of  new  hardware  and  software;  (ix)  conduct  of  a  water  awareness \nprogram; and (x) training of WSD/WSC staff. \n \n16.  An accompanying TA will provide support for development of a trade waste program, \nhealth and safety procedures, environmental legislation and regulations, a community education \nand awareness program, and a tariff study. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n17.  The proposed IRAP which resulted from extensive dialogue between ADB and the \nGovernment provides an appropriately incremental approach to necessary institutional reforms. \nIt is agreed that the development of the WSC requires careful planning and dialogue among \nstakeholders, including those in civil society. The guiding principles are that it be dedicated \nsolely to the delivery of water supply and sewerage services, well governed, autonomous of \ngovernment red tape, and able to mobilize the staff and financial resources necessary to \nprovide  water  supply  and  sewerage  services  sufficient  to  meet  demand  effectively  and \nefficiently.  To  avoid  monopoly  issues,  it  should  be  a  partly  or  wholly  government-owned \ncorporation operating with a clearly defined social purpose, under strict regulatory control. In \norder to avoid unintended negative impacts, the creation of the corporation should be preceded \nby creation of a WSD dedicated to the provision of water and sewerage services, with support \nservices including, but not limited to, administration, personnel, finance, and planning.3  \n \n18.  The IRAP will be implemented in stages, allowing the process to carefully consider each \nstep and gain the necessary stakeholder support. In this way, broad ownership should be \nachieved that will improve the sustainability of the reforms, physical improvements completed \nunder the project and improvements in operation and maintenance management. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n19.  The cost of the Project is estimated at US$72.4 million, of which the foreign exchange \ncost is US$48.0 million (67%) including US$4.7 million in interest during construction, the \ncommitment charge, and the front-end fee on the loan; the local currency cost is US$24.4 \n                                                 \n3 Currently proposed structure of proposed water and sewerage department is shown in Supplementary Appendix C. ", "7 \nmillion (33%). The cost of the physical components includes the cost of land; equipment and \nmaterials;  civil  works;  and  consultants  for  surveys,  preparation  of  detailed  designs,  and \nconstruction supervision. The cost of the institutional development component and the project \nmanagement component includes the cost of equipment and materials and consultants.

Financing Plan \n \n20.  The Government requested a loan of US$47 million, about 65% of total project cost, to \nfinance about 96% of the foreign exchange costs, including all of the foreign exchange costs of \ncivil works, equipment and materials, part of the foreign exchange costs of consultants and the \ncost of interest during construction, and part of the local currency costs of consultants.4 The \nGovernment will finance the foreign exchange cost of consulting services for detailed design \nand construction supervision, and the other local currency costs of the Project, including the \ncosts of land, the costs of duties and taxes, and part of the costs of civil works, equipment and \nmaterials,  and  consultants.  The  Government  prefers  to  provide  all  the  funding  for  the \nconsultants for detailed design and construction supervision, in order to simplify project financial \nadministration. The proposed financing plan is in Table 3 and detailed in Appendix 6.  \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n(US$ million) \nForeign  Local     \nSource of Financing \nExchange  Currency  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank Loan    45.9    1.1    47.0    65% \nGovernment    2.1    23.3    25.4    35% \nTotal    48.0    24.4    72.4    100% \nSource: Appraisal mission estimates. \n \n                                                 \n4  The loan of $47 million would be 65.0% of the cost of the Project excluding the cost of the TA. Under ADB\u2019s cost-\nsharing policy, Fiji is a group C country, and therefore eligible for 65% of the project cost.  ", "8 \n21.  The loan will be from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, under ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility,5 a commitment charge of 0.75% on undisbursed loan balances; and a front-end fee of \n0.5%.6 The Government has stated that its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions was its own independent decision and \nwas not made in reliance on any communication or advice of ADB.   \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n22.  The  Ministry  of  Works  and  Energy  (MWE)  will  be  the  Executing  Agency,  and  its \nWSD/WSC will be the Implementing Agency (IA) for the Project. Two project management units \n(PMUs) will be established within WSD/WSC, one for Part A of the Project and one for Part B \n(Supplementary Appendix D). Although the two PMUs will operate independently, they will meet \non a quarterly basis to review progress and identify any areas needing common action. The \nPMU for Part A will report to the head of the IA and will be responsible for implementation \nprogramming, selection and engagement of consultants, procurement of goods and services, \nmanagement  of  construction,  maintenance  of  project  records,  progress  reporting,  financial \nmanagement, identification of problems and issues that may arise during implementation, staff \ntraining, and preparation of recommendations for adjustments in the Project, if any. The PMU \nfor Part A will be headed by a project manager with suitable expertise, and experience in similar \nprojects. There will also be two assistant project managers, one for water and one for sewerage, \nas  well  as  a  senior  valuer,  a  land  acquisition  officer,  a  community relations officer, an \naccountant, and support staff. Design and supervision consultants will report to the project \nmanager.  The PMU for Part B will report to the head of MWE and will be responsible for \nimplementation programming, selection and engagement of consultants, procurement of goods \nand  services,  supervision  of  consultants,  maintenance  of  records,  progress  reporting, \nidentification of problems and issues that may arise during implementation, staff training, and \npreparation of recommendations for adjustments in the Project, if any. The PMU for Part B will \nbe headed by an institutional development specialist with relevant expertise and experience in \nsimilar operations. In addition, it will have an assistant institutional development manager, short-\nterm advisors, and support staff. WSD/WSC will provide the two PMUs with secretarial and \nother support services. WSD/WSC will operate and maintain the project facilities on completion. \nThe establishment of the PMU-Works and the PMU-Reform, and the designation of each of their \nheads \u2014acceptable to ADB\u2014 will be conditions of loan effectiveness. A consultative process \nwill be established under which WSD/WSC will keep members of community groups (including \nmembers of squatter settlements and indigenous peoples settlements) informed about the \nProject, and seek their support in matters such as location of facilities, land acquisition, and \nidentification of sewage overflows. \n \n23.  A project steering committee (PSC) will be constituted from among the members of the \ncapital works committee, which was established during the preparation of the master plan for \nthe development of water and sewerage service in the Suva\u2013Nausori area, and for the feasibility \nstudy for the Project. The PSC will comprise, but not be limited to, representatives of the \n                                                 \n5 Following standard ADB practice a 5-year LIBOR swap rate (3.3% plus 0.6%) has been assumed in the financial \nanalysis. \n6 The front-end fee of 0.5% is a reduced rate approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors. In the event the loan is not \napproved in 2003, the front-end fee will revert to the standard rate for OCR loans as determined by the Board of \nDirectors. ", "9 \nMinistry of Finance and National Planning, MWE, and the Lands and Survey Department. The \nPSC\u2019s prime roles are high-level coordination, particularly among government departments, and \nidentification and rectification of any issues that may arise during project implementation. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n24.  The Project will be implemented over a 5-year period approximately from April 2004 to \nApril 2009. The implementation schedule is given in Appendix 7. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n25.  Civil works contracts greater than US$2.0 million in value, and equipment and materials \nsupply contracts greater than US$500,000 in value, will be tendered through international \ncompetitive bidding (ICB) procedures, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement \ndated January 2001. Civil works contracts smaller than US$2.0 million will be undertaken under \nlocal  competitive  bidding  (LCB)  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  Equipment  contracts  of \nUS$500,000 or less may be awarded through international shopping procedures acceptable to \nADB.  Prequalification  of  contractors  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  procedures \nacceptable to ADB. Some small and moderate-sized works such as UFW detection and repairs; \npump and motor replacement; and replacement and installation of new water and sewerage \nservice pipes, house connections, and meters will be carried out through force account works, \nacceptable to ADB, which in aggregate will have a value of not more than US$5 million. The \nforce account works would be too small and scattered to be of interest to contractors, and the IA \nhas  adequate  facilities  and  the  capability  to  undertake  the  works  expeditiously  and  at \nreasonable  cost.  Vehicles,  computers,  and  other  equipment  with  a  value  of  less  than \nUS$100,000 per item may be purchased under off-the-shelf or direct purchase procedures, the \nlatter to ensure compatibility with existing equipment. Vehicles and equipment purchased under \nthe Project for use by PMU staff and consultants will be handed over to the IA at the end of \nproject implementation. Detailed designs for each physical component of the Project shall be \nsubmitted to ADB for approval prior to issuance of bidding documents. Indicative procurement \npackages are in Appendix 8 and a procurement summary is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n4.  Advance Procurement Action and Retroactive Financing \n \n26.  The Government has requested that advance procurement action be provided for (i) the \nrecruitment of urgently needed consultants for the PMU-Reform;  (ii) urgent water loss reduction \nactivities undertaken with prior approval of ADB; and (iii) other civil works, equipment and \nmaterials for the water supply system rehabilitation and augmentation incurred under the Project \nprior to the loan effective date. The Government also requested that retroactive financing be \nprovided for items (i) and (ii) procured after 1 January 2004. The retroactive financing will \nfacilitate  project  implementation.  To  be  eligible  for  ADB  financing,  such  recruitment  and \nprocurement will follow ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement dated January 2001. Retroactive \nfinancing will be considered for such recruitment and procurement in an amount not exceeding \nUS$1.0 million. The Government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of the advance action \nand retroactive financing does not commit ADB to provide funding for the Project. MWE\u2019s \ncapacity to carry out advance action has been found adequate. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n27.  Consulting services under the loan will be provided in several packages: (i) project \nmanagement-works;  (ii)  project  management-reform;  (iii)  water  loss  reduction,  infiltration \nassessment, mapping, environmental monitoring and computerization; and (iv) detailed design ", "10 \nand construction supervision (multiple contracts). All of the consultants except those for project \nmanagement-works and detailed design and construction supervision would be funded under \nthe loan. The consultants for package (i) will be selected as individuals and the consultants for \npackages (ii), (iii), and (iv) will be selected as firms. For packages (ii) and (iii), it has been \nagreed that consultants will be selected by MWE in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants using quality- and cost-based procedures. Package (iv) recruitment is under \nway; consultants are being selected by MWE through a process of international quality and \ncost-based selection, similar to that of ADB except that shortlisting was not used. For package \n(i) and (iv), ADB and the Government will agree on the terms of reference prior to consultant \nrecruitment. For package (iv), the invitation materials, the draft contract, the results of the \nevaluation and the proposals of the first-ranked consultants will be provided to ADB for review \nbefore  contract  signing.  For  package  (i),  a  list  of  the candidates,  their  qualifications,  the \nevaluation of their qualifications, and the draft contract will be furnished to ADB for review \nbefore contract negotiations, and ADB will be provided with a copy of the signed contract. \nAppendix 9 gives the summary responsibilities for consultants and summary terms of reference \nare in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n28.  Although project land acquisition and resettlement requirements are not considered to \nbe significant by the standards of ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, there is still enough \nuncertainty in land acquisition requirements, particularly for sewerage, that land acquisition and \nresettlement needs must be monitored carefully. Preliminary sites have been selected for water \nsupply reservoirs and pumping stations, and PWD has made preliminary enquiries with the \nLands and Survey Department to ascertain land status and availability. About 20 hectares (ha) \nof land will be permanently required for the construction of access roads, water supply pumping \nstations, service reservoirs, and intake works, and about 4 ha of land will be temporarily \nrequired for the construction of a main water supply pipeline from the proposed Rewa pumping \nstation  to  the  Waila  water  treatment  plant.  For  the  water  supply  component,  permanent \nresettlement of approximately five households (about 30 persons) will be required.  For the \nsewage component, which is less extensive, but more focused on densely built-up areas, \nresettlement of about the same number of households and persons could be expected. \n \n29.  The  Government\u2019s  procedures  for  acquiring  land,  compensating  landowners,  and \ndealing with resettlement issues are described in a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan \n(RP), presented in Supplementary Appendix G and summarized in Appendix 10. It was agreed \nthat the Government will ensure that all land and rights-of-way required by the Project will be \nmade available in a timely manner and that the provisions of the RP, including compensation \nand entitlements for affected persons, will be implemented in accordance with all applicable \nlaws and regulations, and with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement, following procedures \nacceptable to ADB. A community relations officer in the PMU will assist in community liaison, \nland acquisition, and resettlement. The Government will ensure timely provision of sufficient \ncounterpart funds for land acquisition and resettlement activities and meet any obligations in \nexcess of the RP\u2019s budget estimate. The Government will ensure that resettled persons will be \nat least as well off as they would have been in the absence of the Project. Adequate staff and \nresources  will  be  committed  to  supervision  and  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the \nresettlement plan. The plan will be updated regularly to reflect any significant material changes \nof the project scope or other causes, and such changes will be subject to ADB approval. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n30.  Disbursements for contracts awarded under ICB and LCB  procedures, as well as for ", "11 \ncontracts for consulting services, will be by ADB\u2019s direct payment or reimbursement procedures.  \nAll disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated 2001 \nand detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. ADB will not provide \nfunding for civil works unless consultants acceptable to ADB are recruited or unless staff \nacceptable to ADB are designated to provide for construction supervision.   \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n31.  MWE will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project, and will have the \nproject accounts and financial statements, audited annually by independent private auditors \nacceptable  to  ADB.  The  project  accountant,  engaged  under  the  PMU-Works,  will  have \nexperience  in  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  project  accounting  and  audit  procedures.  MWE  will \nprovide ADB with copies of the audited project accounts and financial statements no later than 9 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. MWE will provide ADB with quarterly \nprogress reports on project implementation. Within 3 months of the physical completion of the \nProject, MWE will provide ADB with a project completion report. Progress reports will be \ncompiled by the two PMUs, and consolidated by the PMU-Works. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n32.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  the  two  PMUs  will  establish  and  maintain  a  project \nperformance  monitoring  system  expanding  on  the  project  framework.  Project  performance \nreports will be included in both PMUs\u2019 regular project reporting procedures, and will indicate the \nprogress made in meeting national institutional performance targets, as well as physical targets \nfor the project area. Performance indicators will include but not limited to, populations served, \navailability of water supplies, UFW, billing and collection efficiency, degree of completion of \ndetailed design work, award of contracts, disbursements and cost recovery.  The proposed \nproject performance monitoring system is described in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n33.  ADB will carry out regular reviews of the progress of the Project in conjunction with the \nPMUs, at least twice per year. Reviews will include progress of policy and institutional reforms, \nas well as of physical works. Reviews will particularly focus on project performance indicators. \nThe Government and ADB will carry out a comprehensive midterm review approximately 2.5 \nyears after project implementation begins. The midterm review will include a review of progress \ntoward achieving the Project\u2019s policy and institutional objectives, as well as progress in physical \ncomponents, procurement arrangements, disbursement arrangements, the performance of the \nPMUs, and the performance of project consultants. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n34.  ADB will provide an associated TA for institutional development and capacity building in \nWSD/WSC. The TA will enhance water and sewerage management by improvements in trade \nwaste management, tariffs, environmental management,  health  and  safety,  and  community \nawareness of water issues. It will produce the following outputs: (i) water sewerage tariffs study; \n(ii) a trade waste program; (iii) a health and safety system for WSD/WSC; (iv) environmental \nlegislation and/or regulations recommendations; and (v) a community awareness and education \nprogram, with training products and course materials for incorporation in school and community \neducation curricula.  A TA framework is in Supplementary Appendix I. \n ", "12 \n35.  The trade waste program will include an assessment of the source, quality, and quantity \nof  trade  wastes;  development  of  legislation  and  regulations;  and  preparation  of \nrecommendations  for  an  action  plan  to  effectively  control  and  manage  trade  wastes.  \nEnvironmental  legislation  advice  and  recommendations  will  support  the  finalization  of  the \nSustainable Development Bill, the Public Health and Pollution Control Bill, and for preparation of \nambient and discharge standards and implementing regulations. The health and safety system \nwill be comprehensive. The development of community education and awareness materials will \ninclude subjects such as water conservation, water handling, sanitation, water-related diseases, \ncivic  awareness,  and  other  related  topics.  Although  the  TA  will  be  community-wide, the \ncommunity awareness component will have a subcomponent focused on slum and squatter \nsettlements. The tariff study will identify tariff needs for acceptable levels of cost recovery, cost \nrecovery mechanisms, tariff structures, and implementation mechanisms, as required to achieve \ncommercial operations and meet debt servicing requirements for the Nadi\u2013Lautoka and Suva\u2013\nNausori systems. The tariff study will ensure that any proposals are affordable and consistent \nwith current government policies. MWE will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be \ncarried  out  over  a  1-year period starting in July 2004 and finishing at end of July 2005. \nConsulting services will comprise 26 person-months of international consulting services and 27 \nperson-months of domestic consulting services. The consultants will be recruited as a firm \nthrough a process of quality- and cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants. The following specialists will be required: tariff specialist, community \neducation specialist, environmental legislation advisor, trade waste specialist, public relations \nspecialist,  health  and  safety  specialist,  environmental  management  specialist,  and \nenvironmental engineer. Reporting will include a brief inception report that focuses on any \nnecessary changes to the scope of work or work program, and interim, draft final, and final \nreports. In addition, each consultant will be required to produce draft final reports relevant to \ntheir inputs for discussion with the Government, ADB, and other stakeholders, with the final \nreport to be submitted within 1 month of receipt of comments from ADB and the Government. \nConsultants will also prepare briefing papers for periodic consultation workshops.  \n \n36.  The cost of the TA is estimated at US$978,000 comprising a foreign exchange cost of \nUS$661,000 and a local currency cost of US$317,000. ADB, through its TA funding program, \nwill finance US$783,000, on a grant basis, for the entire foreign costs of US$661,000 and \nUS$122,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The consultants\u2019 summary terms of reference \nand detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 11.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Benefits \n \n37.  The project area extends for about 25 km from industrial areas around Lami to the west \nSuva, to rural areas around Nausori in the east. It is home to over 262,000 people or about one-\nthird of the country\u2019s total population and almost 60% of its urban population. With in-migration \nfrom other areas of the country, the population is expected to increase at about 3% per annum.  \n \n38.  There are high socioeconomic benefits associated with the Project. The benefits from \nthe investments made in water include meeting suppressed demand of existing domestic and \ncommercial customers, avoiding further deterioration of the system, avoiding tankering of water \nand conserving water through better demand management. The benefits from the investments \nin sewerage include smaller housing plot sizes for residential development under Suva town \nplanning codes, increased economies of land use and avoidance of the costs of constructing \nand maintaining septic tanks. The discharge of raw sewage, has damaged the environment to ", "13 \nthe detriment of all residents and visitors. This degradation has negative effects on residents\u2019 \nability to continue to enjoy the use of the rivers and harbor areas, and it could detract further \nfrom Suva\u2019s tourist potential. The development of improved water supply and sewerage services \nwill contribute to reducing health risks, especially for the poor households in informal squatter \nsettlements. Increases in water and sewerage tariffs will be held in check through efficiency \nimprovements  in  water  and  sewerage  operations.  The  poor  will  benefit  more  than  others \nbecause they will be protected by maintaining a lifeline block for basic water needs. \n \n1.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n39.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for water was calculated for the Project and \nfor the master plan with and without tariff increases. Quantified benefits included the value of \nmeeting suppressed demand and the demand of new customers, saved cost of water tankering, \nsaved cost of small systems absorbed into the larger area, the value of incremental UFW \nactually supplied to consumers, and the value of connection revenues. Replacement and \nrehabilitation of assets was provided at 2.5% of total capital costs every 5 years. The resulting \nEIRR was 26.2% for the Project, 24.9% for the master plan without a tariff increase, and 21.4% \nfor the master plan with a tariff increase, which results in decreased consumption.   \n \n40.  An EIRR for sewerage was calculated for the master plan. Since I&I has not been \nquantified, and the benefits of I&I reduction would pertain more to the Project than to the master \nplan, this could be expected to yield a conservative result lower than that for the Project. \nQuantified benefits included land value, value increases in areas provided with sewerage, plus \nthe avoided cost of constructing and deluding septic tanks. Replacement of rehabilitation of \nassets was provided at 2.5% of capital costs every 5 years. The resulting EIRR for the master \nplan was 9.8%, which is reasonable given that because of lack of data it was not possible to \ncalculate either the value of improved receiving water and environmental quality in areas \naffected by water and environmental quality changes or the cost savings due to decreased I&I. \nThe EIRR for the water and sewerage master plans combined, assuming a water tariff increase \nthat  would  decrease  consumption,  was  18.5%;  this  result  provides  a  strong  economic \njustification for the Project. Details can be found in Appendix 12 and Supplementary Appendix J.  \n \n2.  Poverty  \n41.  A  detailed  poverty  assessment  carried  out  in  parallel  with  project  processing  has \nconfirmed that in 2002 more than 27% of the population of the project area are poor, meaning \nthat their incomes are insufficient to meet basic needs. Such households may have enough to \neat but be unable to provide schooling for their children or health care for their sick. Urban Indo-\nFijians suffer from a slightly higher amount of poverty (31%) although ethnic Fijians are close \nbehind (27%). The incidence of urban poverty has increased since the mid-1990s, due to the \nslowdown of the sugar economy and lack of urban job creation; unemployment increased by \n122% between 1996 and 2002. Although some urban poor may live in small formal housing, \nabout half of them live in informal and squatter settlements.7 Although many  informal and \nsquatter settlements have piped water available to them, it is often available to only a few of the \nresidents and the others must share. Few informal and squatter settlements have sewerage \nfacilities, and suffer from poor sanitation as well as create pollution for others. Pit latrines, water \nseal toilets, and some flush toilets to septic tanks are the main types of toilets in such areas. A \n                                                 \n7  An informal settlement is one in which occupation rights have been given by the landowner but the rights of the \noccupant have not been recorded. A squatter settlement is one in which occupation rights have not been given. \nMost squatter settlements are on marginal and/or state-owned land. ", "14 \nparticipatory hardship assessment carried out in 2002 revealed that people in such areas gave \nwater supplies a high priority. Even those with taps experienced frequent service interruptions \nand those without taps were anxious to be connected. Where shared connections were used, \npeople  were  often  paying  significantly  more  for  their  water  taps  since  the  stepped  tariff \ndiscriminates against large users. Many people in such areas rely on surface and well water for \nnondrinking  purposes,  that  is  frequently  contaminated,  raising  the  risk  of  illness.  Lack  of \nsewerage is a serious problem, particularly in the low-lying informal and squatter communities.  \n \n42.  Although the Government has a policy of providing metered water supply connections to \nindividual dwellings in informal settlement areas, such connections require the landowner\u2019s \npermission, which often takes time or is difficult to secure. The Government also has a program \nfor regularizing squatter settlements, but it depends upon assessments of the suitability of \nregularizing each settlement. In cases where the settlement has not been regularized or will not \nbe regularized, a few occupants will usually succeed in getting a water connection but they do \nso despite lacking the required documentation (an occupancy permit and a building permit). To \naddress these problems, the IA will prepare a program to improve the provision of water and \nsewerage in poor communities and submit it to ADB for review.  \n \n43.  The Project\u2019s water supply component will help reduce health risks, such as infantile \ndiarrhea, that are due to the lack of water and contamination of water arising from low pressure \nin the piped system. It will also provide water for cooking, washing, and bathing, and reduce the \ncost of boiling water. Improvements to sewage disposal to prevent contamination of waterways \nwill benefit the poorest that live in swampy, low-lying, poorly draining areas near the coast such \nas in Vatuwaqa and the Samabula River. These communities use these waterways for fishing \nand supplementing their food sources. The environmental benefits of the Project\u2019s sewerage \ncomponent will improve the quality of life for the poorest people. \n \n44.  A quantitative assessment was carried out of the Project\u2019s net benefit distribution. \nSeveral stakeholder groups were identified, of which the poor were one, and the Project\u2019s net \neconomic benefits to them were estimated, as calculated in the economic analysis described in \nparagraphs 39 and 40, less any changes in the cost to the poor of the improved services. In \naggregate, the water and sewerage components of the Project generate total net economic \nbenefits of about US$40 million, of which it is estimated that about US$14 million will accrue to \nthe poor. This gives a combined project poverty impact ratio of 35%, which is above the \nproportion of poor households and substantially above the proportion of poor household income \nin the project area. The sewerage component yields more than half the net benefits, underlining \nthe importance of implementing sewerage improvements as well as water supply improvements \nin such communities. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13 and a \npoverty impact assessment is in Supplementary Appendix K.  \n \n3.  Financial  Aspects \n45.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the water supply part of the project is 4.0% \nwith  present  tariffs.  Since  the  effects  of  the  short-term  sewerage  investment  cannot  be \nseparately identified, it is not possible to provide an estimate for the FIRR of the combined water \nand sewerage project. The net financial flows for the water supply and sewerage master plans \nwere combined to provide an FIRR for the overall master plan. The master plan FIRR is 3.1% \nwith present tariffs and 5.6% with a 60% tariff increase in 2006 required to set the overall FIRR \nequal to the weighted average cost of capital. Corporatization requires a reasonable prospect of \nsuch a tariff increase, and will require an explicit subsidy payment from the Government until \nprofitability is achieved. For long-term sustainability of the master plan, as well as from the ", "15 \nstandpoint of long term sustainability of water and sewerage operations it will be necessary to \ndouble the water tariff and triple the sewerage tariff.8  \n \n46.  Several options are available to allow such tariff increases without causing affordability \nproblems. In the case of water, the present tariff for nondomestic customers is only about half of \nfull costs and could be increased without causing economic distortion. The size of the first \nlifeline domestic supply block could be reduced provided that arrangements are made to ensure \nthat needy households sharing a water connection are not unduly penalized. In the case of \nsewerage, the tariff should be restructured to be similar to the water tariff. Such changes could \ngenerate the increase in revenues required for commercial operations without creating hardship \nfor existing consumers. For a population already spending substantial amounts for bottled and \ntankered water, it can be expected that willingness to pay will exist provided the services \nprovided are of suitable quality. Tariffs at the levels proposed are affordable for both average \nand low-income households. In 2008, the expected tariffs represent a water and sewerage bill \nequivalent to 2.6% of the income of an average household, a moderate increase as compared \nwith the current level of 1.4%. For a low-income household, when the basic needs covered by \nthe lifeline block (equivalent to consumption of about 60 liters per capita per day) are met, the \nwater and sewerage charges will amount to 1.5% of income in 2008, as compared to 0.9% in \n2001. An internationally acceptable level of affordability for water and sewerage is regarded as \n3\u20135% of monthly household income, indicating that the proposed tariffs are affordable.  \n \nB.  Social and Environmental Impacts \n \n1.  Social \n \n47.  The Project will have a positive social impact. The risk of waterborne disease outbreaks \nwill be decreased. More reliable and improved water supplies will be provided to almost all \nresidents and industries; the latter will lead to improved production and economic stability. The \ntrade waste policy, industrial discharge connections, and sewerage system upgrading will result \nin cleaner waterways and an improved quality of life. Communities will be better informed about \nwater  and  sanitation  issues,  and  improved  operational  performance  will  result  from  such \nawareness. There will be improved public confidence in the provision of water supply and \nsewerage services. Although there will be increased tariff charges for average water and \nsewerage users, the poor will be protected through maintaining a small lifeline block, and \nincreased tariff charges will be offset by reduced taxes. \n \n2.  Environment \n48.  The  Project  will  have  a  positive  benefit  to  the  environment  through  (i)  substantial \nreduction  of  sewage  entering  the  groundwater,  streams,  and  the  sea  due  to  inadequate \ntreatment  in  septic  tanks;  (ii)  substantial  reduction  of  sewage  pump  station  failures  and \nconsequent overflows, which often seriously affect low-lying communities near coastal waters; \nand (iii) provision of sludge treatment facilities at the two project WTP. Altogether, these \nimprovements will help to alleviate serious pollution of streams, drains, and coastal waters in the \nproject area. Improvements in coastal water quality are closely linked to the extension of the \nsewage outfall that is being funded by the European Union, and assurances have been included \nto ensure reporting on the progress of outfall completion. Sustainable improvements in stream, \nground, and marine water quality will be supported through assurances for the enactment of key \nenvironmental legislation, including the Sustainable Development Bill and the Public Health and \n                                                 \n8 Detailed financial projections are included in Supplementary Appendix L. ", "16 \nPollution Control Bill, or other legal measures that will help clarify and strengthen the basis for \nregulation and control of waste discharges. The strengthening of PWD\u2019s water quality laboratory \nand improvement of PWD\u2019s environmental guidelines will help ensure the monitoring of project \nimpacts and benefits, including the sustainability of water quality benefits. \n \n49.  The initial environmental examination (IEE) completed under the feasibility study and the \nupdated  assessment  during  appraisal,  the  recommendations  of  which  are  summarized  in \nAppendix 14, concluded that the Project would have these environmental benefits but also \nnoted potential negative impacts may be experienced due to increased water withdrawals from \nthe Rewa River. However, it is expected that these impacts would be minor, however, since the \ndata used in the modeling and assessment was very limited, this issue will require further \nassessment during detailed design. Negative impacts, such as erosion and sedimentation, are \npossible  during construction works, but can be mitigated through standard engineering and \nenvironmental control practices. An updated environmental assessment will be prepared for all \ncomponents  during  detailed  design  to  confirm  the  conclusions  of  the  IEE  and  develop \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs), satisfactory to ADB, for each project component and \nthe overall Project. Particular attention will be given to the Rewa River intake works and the \nsludge treatment and disposal facilities at the two WTP. Disbursement of funds for these \ncomponents will require detailed environmental examinations and EMPs acceptable to ADB. \nProject environment monitoring will be provided by MWE through its own staff, civil works \nsupervision consultants, and an environmental monitoring consultancy. MWE will ensure that \nthe  Project  is  implemented  in  an  environmentally  sound  manner,  in  accordance  with  the \nrecommendations of the summary IEE, updated EMPs and all applicable laws of the Fiji Islands, \nADB\u2019s Environmental Policy, and ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines from 2003. The \nfull summary IEE is in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n3.  Gender \n50.  Lack of water places an extra burden on women and children by adding to their workload \nin the collection and storage of water. Women are most inconvenienced by intermittent cuts in \nwater supply. In both indigenous Fijian and Indo-Fijian cultures, women are at the center of the \ndomestic sphere with prime responsibility for water and sanitation at home. They are principal \ncarers for children and have control over food preparation, bathing, toileting, and hygiene of \nthese children. Thus, the Project will have a profound effect on women in terms of improving \nenvironmental conditions, improving water supply, and improving their and their children\u2019s \nhealth conditions. The community education and awareness program also targets women.  \n \nC.  Risks \n \n51.  Institutional reforms are necessary in order to provide the quality and quantity of water \nand sewerage services proposed and to sustain the project facilities. However, many of the \nreforms to be implemented under the Project have been under discussion for at least 5 years, \nand the corporatization of water supply and sewerage services, actually begun in 1998, was first \npostponed by the government in power in mid-1999, and then halted by the present government \nin late 2001. Since then, the Government has put the corporatization of water supply and \nsewerage into its strategic plan for 2003-2005, while also expressing a strong desire to maintain \naccessibility to water and sewerage services, avoid tariff increases until services are improved, \nand avoid redundancies. The success of the Project will depend upon the thoroughness with \nwhich institutional reforms are prepared and Government commitment to the reforms. \n \n52.  Improved cost recovery and improved operations and maintenance are closely linked to \nthe institutional reforms. It is important that the management of WSD/WSC receive the political ", "17 \nsupport  and  the  autonomy  necessary  to  operate  more  efficaciously.  Operations  and \nmaintenance improvements are essential to reducing UFW, the high level of which contributes \nto financial inefficiency. Tariff increases are necessary to sustainably operate and maintain the \nsystem. A tariff study is included in the Project to reduce the risk that the Government will not \nraise tariffs by providing recommendations that address all aspects of tariff systems, including \nnecessary cost recovery levels, cost recovery systems and mechanisms to implement them, as \nwell  as  systems  for  the  Government  to  meet  social  obligations  for  affordable  water  and \nsewerage services where these otherwise may not be commercially viable. \n \n53.  Improved environmental management is necessary to effectively manage sewage and \nother pollution sources and improve environmental quality. The public awareness program, \nenvironmental legislation assistance, and trade waste study included under the Project will \nmitigate  risk  of  Government  reducing  its  current  efforts  to  promulgate  the  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Public Health and Pollution Control Bills. The awareness programs and the \nenvironmental  monitoring  program  together  with  the  further  environmental  requirements \nincluded in the detailed design and construction phases will prevent or mitigate potential risks \nassociated with the water intake and water treatment plant sludge disposal system. \n \n54.  The  Government\u2019s  limited  familiarity  with  ADB\u2019s  procedures  for  quality-  cost-based \nselection procedures and PWD water and sewerage division\u2019s lack of recent experience with \nADB\u2019s procurement procedures could result in delays in the early phases of implementation. \nThis risk has been mitigated through relevant discussions during Appraisal and provision of \nguidelines. A project implementation seminar in the Fiji Islands for the EA is also planned. \n \nD.  Overall Assessment \n55.  While there are substantial risks associated with the Project, resources have been built \ninto the project to avoid them. Political commitment will be a key component in risk reduction, \nand this depends on a clear and consistent presentation of the rationale and sequencing of \nproject reforms. From the available evidence the Project benefits will outweigh the costs and the \nProject sufficient robust to be beneficial under the likelihood of various risk occurring. The \nProject contributes to ADB\u2019s strategy for the Fiji Islands and its development goals.  \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n56.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances which are incorporated into the Loan Agreement: \n \n(i)  The Government will comply with, or cause PWD/WSD/WSC to comply with, the \nIRAP, as endorsed by Government\u2019s Cabinet of Ministries on 5 November 2003, \nin particular, \n \n(a)  by 30 June 2004, the Government will have appointed WSD\u2019s advisory \nboard; \n(b)  By 1 July 2004, WSD will have developed a staffing plan for WSD with \nposition  descriptions  for  senior  staff,  resourcing  strategies,  position \nevaluations and redeployment plans; and, by 1 July 2004, WSD and the \nBorrower\u2019s  Public  Service  Commission  will  have  entered  into  a  senior ", "18 \nofficer\u2019s employment agreement, based on key performance indicators, with \nevery senior WSD officer. \n(c)  by 30 September 2004, the Government will have completed the separation \nof those units, staff, assets, and records currently within PWD that will \nmake up the new WSD;  \n(d)  by  30  June  2005,  the  Government  will  have  submitted to Cabinet a \nmemorandum reviewing the progress of reorganization to that date, and \noutlining the further steps to corporatization; and  \n(e)  by 30 September 2005, the Government will have submitted to Cabinet a \nmemorandum  presenting  for  approval  the  charter,  organization  plan, \nstaffing plan, outline chart of accounts, management information reporting \nsystem,  and  the  financing  and  regulatory  arrangements  for  WSC.  The \nGovernment will cause Cabinet consideration of this cabinet memorandum \nto take place not later than 31 December 2005. \n \n(ii)  To ensure transparency and accountability, WSD/WSC will make available to the \npublic its annual corporate plan within 3 months after the commencement of each \nyear,  and  its  annual  report  and  financial  statements  within  6  months  after \ncompletion of each year. The results of the tariff study will also be made public, \nso that the community is prepared for these increases. \n \n(iii)  The following operational improvements will be under taken: \n(a)  The Government will cause WSD/WSC to establish client services units in \neach major service area, with the objective of responding to all customer \ncomplaints.  WSD/WSC  will  respond  to  any  such  complaints  involving \ninterruptions of services, leaks, or blockage of sewage within 48 hours, and \ncomplaints  involving  errors  in  bills  and  similar  matters  within  30  days. \nWSD/WSC will establish the client services unit in the Suva-Nausori area \nby not later than 31 December 2004. \n(b)  By 1 July 2004 and continuing thereafter, WSD/WSC will undertake a \nprogram of community awareness of water issues, including water demand \nmanagement, water handling, waterborne disease, and sanitation. \n(c)  WSD/WSC will undertake a program for provision of water supply and \nsewerage services in poor urban and rural communities, including squatter \nsettlements.  The  program  will  aim  at  universal  access  to  water  and \nsewerage services at cost levels affordable and acceptable to the poor. The \nprogram will be provided to ADB for review by 31 December 2004. \n(d)  By 31 January 2004, PWD/WSD will have adopted a water loss reduction \nprogram satisfactory to ADB, providing for reduction of UFW in the Suva\u2013\nNausori area to not more than 30% by 31 December 2007.  \n(e)  The Government will ensure (a) by 31 December 2005, the implementation \nof a sewer rehabilitation program designed to reduce inflows and infiltration; \nand  (b)  by  31  December  2006,  the  implementation  of  a  trade  waste \nprogram  with  a  discharge  permit  system  to  cover  all  non-domestic \ndischarges to wastewater system with adequate standards, appropriate \ntreatment requirements, and monitoring and enforcement provisions.   \n(f)  The  Government  will  develop  and  implement  a  long-term  program  for ", "19 \nmonitoring  the  quality  of  receiving  waters  and  the  aquatic  biological \nenvironment affected by the Project.  \n(g)  The  Government  will,  through  its  regular  quarterly  reports,  keep  ADB \napprised of progress on the extension of the Kinoya sewage outfall, and \ninform ADB of any delays, changes, or problems that could affect the \nperformance of the Project. \n \n(iv)  The following financial management improvements will be undertaken: \n \n(a)  The Government will cause WSD to set up an accounting system, following \nexisting government accounting procedures, which will provide data on \ncosts and revenues by district by month. Overhead costs will be reported \nseparately and allocated in the management information reporting system \nto be set up under the Project. \n(b)  The Government will cause WSD/WSC to conduct a tariff study that will \nconsider and agree appropriate levels of cost recovery and mechanisms for \ncost recovery systems, including means for the Borrower to meet social \nobligations for affordable water supply and sewerage, consider and agree \nappropriate tariffs to ensure that poor families sharing a connection are not \npenalized by high block rates, and review and discuss existing demand \nforecasts. The Borrower will ensure this report is released to the public.  \n(c)  Beginning from 1 January 2004, PWD/WSD will establish a debt collection \nunit to enforce a disconnection policy with the objective of reducing the \noutstanding debts to 90 days by 31 December 2004, and to 60 days by 31 \nDecember 2005.  Disconnections will be initiated when a water or sewerage \nbill is more than 30 days in arrears, and will be carried out within 30 days of \nbeing ordered, in line with prevailing government regulations. \n(d)  By 30 April 2005, WSD will establish an accounting system able to produce \nan  income  statement,  balance  sheet,  and  cash  flow/flow-of-funds \nstatements following accrual accounting procedures and other generally \naccepted accounting policies. \n(e)  By  31  December  2007,  taking  into  account  the  results  and \nrecommendations of the tariff study, the Government will cause WSD/WSC \nthrough improvements in operations and financial management to achieve \nrecovery of the costs of operations, maintenance and debt service. \n \n(f)  WSC, once established, will operate in a financially sustainable manner, \nwithin  a  social  policy  and  regulatory  framework  established  by  the \nGovernment. To the extent that WSD agrees to undertake social services, \nand these require subsidies, these will be subsidized by the Government. \n \n (v)  The Government will ensure, and will cause MWE, WSD and/or WSC as the \ncase may be to ensure, that the Project facilities are designed, constructed, \noperated, maintained and monitored in strict conformity with: (a) all applicable \ngovernment laws, regulations, permits and approvals, including national and local \nenvironmental protection, social development, health, labor, child protection, and \noccupational safety regulations and standards; (b) all mitigation and monitoring \nmeasures detailed in the various environmental assessments and plans relating \nto the Project, e.g., the initial environmental examination (IEE), and all relevant ", "20 \nenvironmental  assessments  (EAs)  and  environmental  management  plans \n(EMPs);  and  (c)  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  and  ADB\u2019s  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines, 2003. \n \n(vi)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (a) the Government will ensure \nthat  during  the  detailed  design  stage  of  the  Project,  EAs  and  EMPs,  all \nsatisfactory  to  ADB,  are  completed  for  each  phase  of  the  Project;  (b)  the  \nGovernment will ensure that environmental mitigation measures identified as a \nresult of the IEE, EAs or EMPs are incorporated as relevant into the various \ndesign and bidding documents, and later into each contract of works under the \nProject; (c) with regard to the water and environmental monitoring referred to  \nabove,  the  Government  will  cause  the  water  and  environmental  monitoring \nprogram  to  be  undertaken  under  the  guidance  and  supervision  of  the \nEnvironment Department and the Health Department and will ensure monitoring \ninformation is included in project progress reports submitted to ADB; and  \n \n(vii)  The  Government  will  complete  passage  of  the  Public  Health  and  Pollution \nControl Bill and the Sustainable Development Bill by 30 June 2005 or effect other \nlegal measures needed to achieve the sewage system connection, trade waste \nmanagement, watershed protection, water quality standards, and environmental \nmonitoring programs required under the Project.  \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that all land and rights-of-way required for the \nProject will be made available in a timely manner, and that the provisions of a \nland acquisition and resettlement plan, including compensation and entitlements \nfor affected persons, will be implemented in accordance with all applicable laws \nand regulations, and to the satisfaction of ADB. The plan will be revised and \nupdated  based  on  detailed  designs  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  review  and \napproval before implementation of the related physical works. \n \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n57.  Approval of the organization and staffing plan for WSD acceptable to ADB by the Public \nService Commission; designation of the head of WSD, who will be suitably qualified and \nexperienced for the position; the establishment of a PMU-Works and a PMU-Reform, with in \neach case a designated head acceptable to ADB; and appointment of the change manager to \noversee the reform process within PWD/WSD will be conditions of loan effectiveness. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n58.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB a+nd recommend that the Board approve the loan of US$47,000,000 to the Republic of the \nFiji Islands for the Suva\u2013Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n  20 November 2003 ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nSUMMARY SECTOR/SUBSECTOR ANALYSIS \nA.  Introduction and Scope \n \n1.  The relevant sub-sectors in the analysis included water supply and urban wastewater \nmanagement.  This  appendix  briefly  summarizes  the  status  of  the  subsectors,  including  (i) \nrelevance to ADB\u2019s Water Policy and country strategy; (ii) indicators, such as environmental quality \nand access to sanitation; and, (iii) institutional framework. Appendix 4, Institutional Reform Action \nPlan, Supplementary Appendix A, Demand Assessment, and Supplementary Appendix B, Sector \nRoadmap provide the relevant details for indicators and necessary institutional, legislative, policies \ntechnical, planning needs, and action plans.  \n \nB.  ADB Sector Focus and Country Strategy and Program \n \n2.  ADB's  Water  Policy  supports  integrated  water  resource  management  improved  and \nexpanded  delivery  of  water  services,  foster  cooperation  and  awareness,  promote  regional \ncooperation, facilitate the exchange information and improve governance. It further emphasizes the \nneed for autonomous management of water utilities, cost recovery and private sector participation \nwhile ensuring access and equitable service to the poor and vulnerable. The Country Strategy and \nProgram for Fiji aims at promoting economic growth and improve the quality of life, especially for \nthose left behind or vulnerable to external shocks or natural disasters. The strategy is consistent \nwith  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  development  plan  for  2003-2005.  ADB  will  focus  on  public \ninvestment in physical infrastructure in key sectors, strengthen associated policy institutional and \nregulatory framework frameworks, and promote private sector participation in public enterprises. \nThe CSP update is well aligned with the millennium development goals. The project supports \nADB\u2019s strategy for the Fiji Islands and the ADB Water Policy through (i) fostering good water and \nenvironment governance; (ii) improving living conditions and, (iii) at promoting private sector growth \nimproved environmental infrastructure. \n \nC.  Indicators \n \n3.  A large majority of the population (50%) have access to potable water. And 75% has \naccess to safe sanitation, In Suva-Nausori approximately 93% have access to safe water and \nabout 27% are served by the wastewater collection system and most of the remainder by septic \ntanks, though some have no facilities (specific data are not available). Marine and urban stream \nwater  quality  in  the  Suva-Nausori  area  has  been  significantly  degraded  as  a  result  of  the \ninadequate sanitation and poor condition of the sewer system. Water quality monitoring data \nshows definitive evidence of sewage contamination. \n \nC.  Institutional Framework \n \n4.  Present  institutional  arrangements  for  water  supply  and  sewerage  and  environmental \nmanagement are weak. Water and sewerage operations are managed from a division within the \npublic works department, which leads it to compete for human and financial resources, resulting in \nmanagement  deficiencies.  The  Government\u2019s  strategic  development  plan  for  2003-2005 \nrecognizes the need for institutional reform to achieve acceptable operations and maintenance and \ncost recovery levels and thus calls for corporatization of water supply and sewerage service by end \nof  2005.  Environmental  legislation  is  limited,  which  also  has  constrained  development  of \nappropriate management system; however, the Government is in the process of promulgating a \nsustainable development bill and public health and pollution control bill.   \n \nD.  Need for the Project \n \n5.  Rehabilitation, optimization and expansion of the water supply and sewerage systems are \nurgently needed. Institutional reforms included in the Project that will in turn result in improved \noperations  and  maintenance  and  cost  recovery  ensure  sustainability  of  Project  outputs.", "22  Appendix 2

Overhead \ncosts should be reported separately and consideration should be given to allocating them in \nthe management information system to be set up. \n\u2022  Revenues  collected  by  the  WSD  through  the  Water  Rates  Office  will  continue  to  be \ntransferred to the Government\u2019s consolidated fund.  \n\u2022  The WSD and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) will oversee the tariff study planned under the \nloan to ensure that (I) alternative definitions of full cost recovery are defined and discussed; \n(ii) appropriate levels of cost recovery for different types of system and for the operation as a \nwhole are discussed and agreed upon; (iii) consideration is given to the possibility of varying \ntariffs by system; (iv) means are set up to ensure that poor families sharing a connection are \nnot penalized by high block rates; (v) consideration is given to lowering the size of the first \ndomestic  block  (band);  and  (vi)  existing  demand  forecasts  are  reviewed,  discussed, \namended as necessary, and a system for continuous review and updating is set up.  \n\u2022  WSD will review and update an earlier valuation of water and sewerage assets and liabilities \nand prepare financial statements to enable them to be transferred to the WSC on its \ncreation (not later than 31 December 2005). \n\u2022  The WSC will assume the assets and liabilities of the water and sewerage systems for which \nit becomes responsible. \n\u2022  The WSC will use a double entry accounting system and will follow accrual accounting \nprocedures and other generally accepted accounting policies. \n\u2022  The WSC will continue the procedure set up by WSD to provide monthly data on costs and \nrevenues by district. Consideration will be given on the appropriateness of the district as \ncost center.  \n\u2022  In conjunction with MOF, the WSC will determine the level of cost recovery required by each \ncost center. If these agreed levels imply the need for subsidies, arrangements will be made \nfor them to be recorded in the WSC books. MOF might wish to fund these subsidies directly. \nIf not, they should be used to increase government equity. They should be allowed for in any \nrequired cost recovery for the WSC as a whole.    \n\u2022  The act or other legislation setting up the WSC will enable the board to retain relevant \nrevenues collected by the Water Rates Office.  \n\u2022  MOF will pass on to the WSC, in Fiji dollars, any international and local loans taken out to \nfinance its operations and expansion so that they appear on the entity\u2019s books of account. ", "  Appendix 5  31 \n\u2022  The WSC will be charged with paying debt service on those loans to MOF. \n\u2022  If tariff revenues are not sufficient to make full loan payments, the residual will, after \nnegotiations, be used to increase government equity in the WSC. \n\u2022  The Government will clarify the tariff basis (monthly or quarterly), strengthen meter reading, \nbilling and collection procedures, and enforce a well-publicized disconnection policy for \nnonpayment, with the objective of reducing the outstanding debtors from the presently \nestimated 300 days to 90 days by 31 December 2004, and to 60 days by 31 December \n2005. \n\u2022  Customers whose water or sewerage bill is more than 30 days in arrears will be informed \nthat if they do not pay within 30 days they will be disconnected. Following disconnection, the \nservice will not be restored until the debt and a reconnection charge are paid.  \n\u2022  To the extent that the WSD/WSC agrees to provide water or sewerage to social services, \nand that these require subsidies, the latter will be provided by the Government. WSD will \nobtain the repeal of the ordinance that provides rebates to customers for water losses after \ntheir meter. \n\u2022  Not later than 31 December 2004 the Government will submit to Parliament a bill to amend \nthe Sewerage Act to provide for disconnection of water services in the event of nonpayment \nof the sewerage bill. \n\u2022  The WSC will through improvements in operations and financial management achieve the \nfollowing levels of cost recovery: (i) operation, maintenance, and debt interest, not later than \n31 December 2006; and (ii) operation, maintenance, and the higher of (a) debt service and \n25% of capital costs or (b) depreciation plus interest, not later than 31 December 2012.  \n \n\u2022  The Government will monitor the financial situation of WSD/WSC and, in the event the \nabove targets are not expected to be met, take action to enable their achievement, including \nfurther improvements in operational efficiency, tariff adjustments, or tariff increases. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "32  Appendix 6 \nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A6.1:  Cost Estimate \n \n            Foreign      Local      Total \nItem  Exchange    Currency    Cost \n            (US$\u2018000)     (US$\u2019000)     (US$\u2019000) \n                 \nA.

Introduction \n1.  This summary resettlement and land acquisition plan, prepared in accordance with the \nGovernment of the Republic of Fiji's laws and regulations and the related policy of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), provides a framework of compensation for the Suva-Nausori Water \nSupply and Sewerage Project. As detailed design confirms land needs, the Government will \nupdate and revise the plan in accordance with ADB\u2019s resettlement guidelines with assistance \nfrom the design consultants, particularly to ensure that the sewerage component\u2019s land needs \nare clearly identified. \n \nB.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  About  20  hectares  (ha)  of  land  will  be  permanently  acquired  and  another  4  ha \ntemporarily  acquired  for  water  supply  system  improvements.  Three  categories  of  land \nacquisition and resettlement have been identified: (i) permanent acquisition of approximately 5 \nha and resettlement of approximately five households to acquire additional land adjacent to \nexisting pump stations; (ii) permanent acquisition of approximately 15 ha of uninhabited native \nland  for  access  roads,  pump  station  sites,  storage  reservoirs,  and  intake  works;  and  (iii) \ntemporary acquisition of native and freehold land belonging to about 5 native landowners, 5 \nfreehold  owners,  and  a  maximum  of  10  lessees  without  resettlement  as  easement  and \nassociated access for the laying of 6.3 kilometers of main water supply pipeline, temporary \naccess routes, construction areas, stockpiles, and storage areas. Most water supply pipelines \nwill use existing main road reserves. Project land acquisition and resettlement requirements are \nnot considered to be \u201csignificant\u201d according to ADB policy; the landowners are unlikely to be \nconsidered to be poor and no more than 50 indigenous persons will be affected.  \n \nC.   Government Policy, Legal, and Institutional Framework \n \n3.  In the Fiji Islands there are three types of land: native land, freehold land, and state land. \nThe majority of land is classified as native and is under the administration of the Native Land \nTrust Board. Such land is very important to native landowners as a link to their ancestral past \nand identity. The Department of Lands and the Public Works Department (PWD) have a written \nprocedure on land acquisition based on the Crown Acquisitions of Lands law. The law, however, \ndoes not provide for resettlement, only cash compensation. In practice, aside from cash, PWD \nprovides  \u201dgoodwill\u201d  compensation  to  landowners  such  as  employment  opportunities,  \nplaygrounds, water supply systems, and footpaths. Under the current legal framework, the PWD \nhas the right to enter land and construct easements, access roads, or pipelines for the public \ngood. Under the Sewerage Act, it can enact compulsory acquisition of land, but this right has \nnot  been  claimed  in  the  last  20  years.  Negotiation  with  the  landowners  is  the  preferred \noperational procedure, which involves forwarding the application to the Department of Lands \nand either purchasing the land outright or leasing it for up to 99 years. In practice, land is usually \nleased rather than purchased. The Native Land Trust Board is involved in negotiations when \nnative land is involved. The Department of Lands makes acquisition payments directly to \nlandowners, except in the case of native land, where the money is channeled to the trust board \nfor distribution to landowners.  \n \nD.   Resettlement and Land Acquisition Principles \n \n4.  Adverse impacts on existing human settlements, land, buildings, and other assets and ", "42  Appendix 10 \nlivelihoods will be minimized if not avoided to the greatest extent possible. In the case of any \nadverse impact, persons so affected will be compensated at replacement cost and offered \nassistance  to  maintain,  if  not  improve,  their  standard  of  living,  access  to  basic  services, \nproduction levels, and income-earning capacity. \n \nE.   Entitlements \n \n5.  The Lands Acquisition Compensation Act also provides for loss of rents and profits. \nUnder the current system for crop compensation, PWD staff pay compensation directly to \nfarmers  according  to  a  comprehensive  schedule  published  by  the  Department  of  Primary \nIndustries and updated annually. The schedule covers mature and immature plants by type of \nplant. There are three types of people eligible for compensation: landowners, lessees, and \nsublessees.  Table A8.1 shows the compensation entitlement scheme. \n \nTable A10.1: Entitlement Matrix \nType of Loss  Entitled Persons  Compensation and  Implementation Issues \nRehabilitation Measures \n1. Loss of Land       \nA.

Consultation and Grievance Procedures \n \n6.  To acquire native land, PWD and the Department of Lands meet with members of \nrespective clans in their own villages and any lessees individually to explain their intent, answer \nquestions, and get consensus from landowners. On freehold lands, the department\u2019s Valuation ", "  Appendix 10  43 \nSection prepares a sale and purchase agreement and approaches the landowner to explain and \nexecute the document after the landowner\u2019s agreement. PWD and the Department of Lands \nstart consultations and approach landowners at least 6 months prior to project implementation. \nIn the case of a dispute, landowners can take the Government to court to obtain an injunction \nand stop the land acquisition, a rare but well-established procedure. For compulsory acquisition, \nPWD applies to the Solicitor General\u2019s Office for approval. The Project will ensure that there is \nno  disturbance  to  sacred  sites  such  as  burial  grounds  or  the  house  sites  of  ancestors. \nConsultation with landowners is essential to ensure there is no conflict about the location of \nwater and sewerage infrastructure. Several meetings with landowners will be required.  \nG.   Resources, Financing, and Implementation Arrangements \n7.  Funds for land acquisition (purchase or leasing), compensation, and resettlement are \nappropriated in the annual budget of the Ministry of Works and Energy. Contingencies are \nprovided  in  accordance  with  annual  budgetary  appropriations.  The  principal  institutions \nconcerned in the process are all well established as is the process itself. The Department of \nLands prepares a schedule to monitor negotiations, payment, survey, and other arrangements. \nTable  A8.2  summarizes  the  anticipated  funding  and  implementation  arrangements.  The \nGovernment has committed itself to funding any necessary resettlement and land acquisition. \n \nTable A10.2: Financing and Implementation Schedule \n(F$)  \nActivity  Total  2004  2005  2006 \n       \nResettlement of Squatters  450,000  200,000  150,000  100,000 \nPermanent Land Acquisition  725,000  300,000  22,500,000  200,000 \nTemporary Easement Acquisition  325,000  150,000  100,000  75,000 \n     Source: Government estimates. \nH.

Methodology and Assumptions \n \n1.  The economic and financial analyses were carried out for both the initial 5-year program, \nto be financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan being appraised, and for the entire \nwater supply and sewerage 20-year master plan. As is to be expected, the benefits of the \nimmediate project are higher than those of the master plan since major parts of the early \nbenefits will be water loss reduction, requiring comparatively little investment, and increases in \ncollection efficiency. Decisions regarding options for the master plan were evaluated using \neconomic least-cost analysis. The following general assumptions have been adopted:  \n \n(i)  Prices in general are adjusted to 2003 constant prices from the 2002 prices used \npreviously. By agreement with the Ministry of National Planning, the local inflation \nrate was taken at 2.5%.   \n(ii)  The least-cost analyses carried out in the 1999 master plan used 1999 constant \nprices; it is unnecessary to update them since the options have not changed and \nprice adjustments will affect all equally.  \n(iii)  Each project component is assumed to have a useful economic life of 40 years \nafter construction for civil works and 15 years for electrical and mechanical \ncomponents. For the ADB-funded project, replacements have been included at \n2.5% of previous investment once every 5 years. \n(iv)  The period of the master plan investment program is 20 years. An allowance is \nmade in year 30, equivalent to 5% of project capital costs, to provide for the \nreplacement  of  mechanical  and  electrical  equipment  and  vehicles  over  the \nbalance of the evaluation period, years 21 to 40. No residual values are assumed  \nin year 40. \n(v)  Financial flows are discounted at the estimated weighted average cost of capital \nof 4%. This is a minimum to be applied when the calculated weighted average \ncost of capital is lower.1  \n(vi)  The economic opportunity cost of capital employed in the economic analysis is \nassumed to be the standard 12% per annum. \n(vii)  The average household size is 5.5 persons. Based on 2002 water consumption \ndata, they consumed 187 litres per capita per day (lpcd). Supplies are assumed \nto have constrained demand, which is estimated to be 190 lpcd with present \nincomes and present tariffs. \n(viii)  Incomes have been allowed for in the demand forecasts by assuming per capita \nincome growth of 2% per annum and an income elasticity of 0.60. \n(ix)  The effects of tariff increases have been estimated using price elasticities of \u2013\n0.20  for  domestic  and  \u20130.05  for  nondomestic.  These  figures  are  based  on \ninternational rather than the Fiji Islands data. They are low as a result of the \npresent low level of tariffs. \n(x)  Wastewater generation is estimated at 85% of water consumption. \n(xi)  Capital  costs  include  physical  contingencies  (10%  for  water  and  12%  for \nsewerage) but exclude price contingencies and interest during construction. \n(xii)  All economic costs, in particular of imported tradeable inputs, are net of duties \nand taxes. Financial costs include (a) duties and taxes at 2.0% of total base \ncosts, based on taxes and duties on imported items of 10% for pumping and \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2002.Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects.

There are no competing uses of the raw water such as irrigation in the \nSuva-Nausori area. \n(xiv)  The average official exchange rate of F$2.00 per US$1.00 (as of April 2003) has \nbeen employed in converting foreign exchange costs to their local currency \nequivalent.  \n(xv)  In economic pricing, domestic price numeraire in local currency unit (F$) was \nused. Based on 1999 imports and customs revenue data, weighted average tariff \nrate = 14.1% percent, therefore a shadow exchange rate factor is approximated \nby 1.141 (this is equivalent to a standard conversion factor of 1/(1+WATR) = \n0.88). \n(xvi)  It is assumed that there are no significant distortions in the wage rates for skilled \nlabor. In the case of unskilled labor, underemployment exists in the Fiji Islands \neconomy resulting in the opportunity cost of unskilled labor being less than the \nminimum wage. In the third Fiji Road Upgrading Project2 a shadow wage rate of \n0.860 was calculated. This factor has also been adopted for the current project. \n \n B.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n2.  The least-cost analysis has been carried out in economic prices. It is used to determine \nwhich development option (or combined options) is preferred economically where a number of \nviable technical alternatives exist. Four components were subjected to the least-cost analysis. \n \n3.  Development of a New Water Source. Three options to supply Suva-Nausori water \ndemands for the next 20 years were considered: Rewa run-of-river, Waldina run-of-river, and \nstorage dams on the upper Waimanu and Sovi rivers, with and without hydroelectric generation \ncapacity. The least-cost option was found to be developing a new intake and pumping station on \nthe Rewa River, and continuing to take water from the existing Waila intake. Water from both \nsources would be treated at Waila. Least-cost analysis was also used to evaluate the proposed \nRewa River rising main diameter.  \n \n4.  Transfer of Treated Water to Suva City. The demand for treated water from the \nexisting  Waila  water  treatment  plant  is  expected  to  double  during  the  next  20  years. \nAccordingly, it will be necessary to increase the transfer of water from the Waila treatment plant, \nthrough pipelines in King\u2019s Road, to lower and medium pressure water distribution zones in \ncentral Suva. Three options were considered: duplication of the trunk main from Wainibuku to \nMead Road, booster pumping from one of the trunk mains at Wainibuku reservoir, and reduced \npumping from Wainibuku and construction of a new section of trunk through the high point in \nKing\u2019s Road. The least-cost option was found to be duplicating a trunk water supply pipeline \nfrom Wainimbuku to Mead Road, with sufficient capacity to overcome the low pressures in \nKing\u2019s Road.  \n \n5.  Augmentation of Water Treatment Plants. Three options for augmenting the water \ntreatment to meet maximum day demands from year 5 to year 20 were considered. They \nincluded maintaining the existing Tamavua water treatment plant capacity and providing 20 \nmegaliters per day (Ml/d) capacity increase at Waila in 2002 and 2011; increasing the capacity \nof Tamavua by 9 Ml/d and providing 20 Ml/d capacity increases at Waila in 2003 and 2015; and \n                                                 \n2 ADB. 1997. Third Road Upgrading (Sector). Manila. ", "  Appendix 12  49 \nincreasing Tamavua by 16 Ml/d and providing 20 Ml/d capacity increases at Waila in 2010 and \n2019. The least-cost option was found to be increasing the output of the Tamavua water \ntreatment plant during droughts to by 16 Ml/d by duplication of the Upper Waimanu rising main \nand using three pumps, and providing 20 Ml/d additional capacity at Waila in 2010 and 2019.  \n \n6.  Sewerage and Sewage Treatment. Two broad options have been identified for future \ntreatment and disposal of Suva\u2019s sewerage: (i) a \u201ccentralized\u201d strategy, which assumes that all \nsewage, except sewage from Nausori, will be diverted to and treated at the existing plant in \nKinoya; and (ii) a \u201clocalized\u201d strategy, which envisages utilizing the existing plant at Kinoya, \ntogether with new plants to be located in growth areas at the extremities of Suva\u2019s sewerage \nsystem, at Waila and Lami. The centralized strategy was found to be least cost.  \n \nC.  Economic Analysis  \n \n1.  Water Supply  \n \n7.  Capital and operating costs were forecast for 2 years for the ADB Project and for 20 \nyears for the master plan. After these periods, operating costs are held constant with an \nallowance made for replacement and rehabilitation at 2.5% of project capital costs every 5 \nyears. No residual values are assumed at the end of 40 years. Operating costs used in the \nmaster plan and feasibility study analyses included only direct operation and maintenance and \ndid not include salaries and wages or overheads. The latter have been added at rates derived \nfrom the analysis of the likely costs of a Fiji Water Authority, given in the feasibility study. They \nwere obtained from Ministry of Works costs and add 57% and 15%, respectively. The inclusion \nof these costs does mean that both the costs and benefits of corporatization have been \nincluded. \n \n8.  The physical project will provide water for sale, mainly through decreased physical and \nfinancial losses. The assumptions made for total losses are: 2003, 56% (2002 actual); 2004, \n50%; 2005, 45%; 2006, 40%; 2007, 35%; 2008 plus, 30%. The effect of not decreasing losses \nbelow 40% is included in the sensitivity analysis. The present share of financial losses is \nassumed to be 12% of production. \n \n9.  Nonincremental benefits include the following: (i) meeting the demand of new customers \nat present satisfied demand levels; (ii) saved cost of water tankering in drought conditions, (iii) \ncost savings from absorbing small systems into the greater Suva-Nausori network. Incremental \nbenefits include the following: (i) meeting suppressed domestic and commercial demands, (ii) \nnon-evenue water consumed under the Project; (iii) the cost of new connections, assumed \nequal to willingness to pay. Valuation of these items is summarized in Table A10.1. Note, \nhowever, that the incremental benefit differentiation is less relevant when the Project is not \nreplacing water from an alternative, normally traditional, source.3  \n                                                 \n3  Nonincremental costs to the user are then higher than incremental and the downward sloping demand curve can \nbe used to value the latter. In this study, as in others when water is being replaced by water of higher quality and/or \nreliability, expressed willingness to pay for the incremental is higher than actual payments for the nonincremental. If \ntaken simplistically, this would imply an upward sloping demand curve. That is the reason why the survey-based \nwillingness to pay value has been used for both incremental and nonincremental sales.

The estimated base case economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the water supply \ncomponent of the ADB-funded 5-year project is 26.2%. For the 20-year master plan it is 24.8%. \nWith tariff increases to provide the required financial return, sales would be less and the EIRR \nwould fall to 21.4%. \n59.  Sensitivity  analyses  indicate  that  the  economic  viability  is  robust  to  adverse  changes, \nespecially to cost increases. Benefits are a combination of unit benefits, as shown in Table A10.1, \nand m3 sales and so the range in possible results is larger. The number of items involved is large \n(volumes and values for each of the items in Table A10.1) and to show the sensitivity to each would \nbe confusing. Therefore, the sensitivity to a relatively large fall in total benefits is shown in Table \nA10.2. As can be seen, benefits associated with the overall growth in satisfied water demand, \nparticularly to the non-domestic sector, are the largest item in these benefit flows and so would \naccount for much of the variation shown. This is the result particularly of the assumed additional unit \nbenefit to the non-domestic sector, at least in terms of willingness to pay.  \nTable A12.2: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Water \n    ADB  Project Master  Plan  Master  Plan \nNo \n      Increase  Tariff  Increase \nItem  Tariff \nChange  EIRR  SV  EIRR  SV  EIRR  SV \nBase Case    26.2%     24.9%     21.4%    \nA.

Sewerage  \n \n11.  The time frame of the analysis is the same as that of the water supply ADB and master \nplan  projects.  Operating  costs  are  held  constant  with  an  allowance  for  replacement  and \nrehabilitation at 2.5% of project capital costs every 5 years. Salaries, wages, and overheads \nhave been added to direct operation and maintenance. No residual values are assumed at the \nend of 40 years.  \n \n60.  There are two main ways to evaluate a sewerage program economically. These are: (a) \nstandard benefit cost analysis (BCA); (b) measure the project\u2019s output against relevant standards, on \nthe assumption that those standards have been set to reflect costs and benefits4.  The  latter \napproach is difficult for the Project since there are no accepted river water quality standards in the \nFiji Islands and the water whose pollution is being controlled goes all but directly into the ocean. \n \n61.  Standard BCA requires a means to estimate peoples\u2019 willingness to pay (wtp) for the project \nbenefits. The various alternative methods to do this can be summarised as (a) contingent valuation \nsurveys, (b) estimation of direct costs such as health and environment, (c) estimates of land value \nincreases; (d) avoided costs of installing own septic tanks and/or replacing septic tanks on new and \nexisting properties and dislodging costs. Data is not available for the first two of these. For land \nvalues it is possible to use building densities allowed by the planners for properties in areas where a \nsewage connection is possible. This is a potential benefit based upon ability to subdivide and has \nbeen measured separately from the actual connection. Therefore it can be assumed to be additional \nto the direct avoided cost benefits.  The assumptions used to measure these two benefits are given \nin Table A10.3.   These benefits do not include health and amenity benefits to people living along \npolluted rivers or using the ocean into which they discharge. \n   \nTable A12.3: Economic Benefit Values for Sewerage \nBenefit per New Connection  Unit  Value  Rationale \nIncreased Land Use Values       \nNew Housing Authority Plots  F$/conn. or 400 m2 plot  3000  Increased plot value \nNew (Small) Private Plots  F$/conn. or 600 m2 plot  5000  Increased plot value \nBacklog Sewerage Connections  F$/conn. or plot  10,000  Increased plot value \nAvoided Costs of Septic Tanks       \nAvoided Initial Capital Cost or  F$2,000 per 15 year life \nF$/conn. per annum  239 \nReplacement  tank \nAvoided Cost of Desludging  F$/conn. per annum  40  F$120 per 3 year trip \nm2=square meters, conn=connection. \nSource: Appraisal Mission estimates. \n \n12.  The sewerage program is long term and it is all but impossible to separately identify the \nbenefits that would accrue from the ADB-funded 5-year project. If it were to be assumed that \nthere would be no further investment and so no additional sewerage connections, economic \nbenefits would be less than costs in all future years. This is not a reasonable assumption, \nhowever, so the economic analysis of the sewerage component is based on the investments \nand benefits identified in the master plan. The former have been adjusted to allow for the \npresently expected costs of the project. It can also be noted that a major benefit of the project \n                                                 \n4 Economic Issues in the Design and Analysis of a Wastewater Treatment Project, Technical Note 4, ERD, ADB, July \n2002.

Making  connections  in  areas  already  served  (the  backlog)  would  be  the  result  of \ninstitutional rather than physical project change. Therefore results have been obtained for both \nthe physical project and for that project plus institutional change (which would ensure that \nplaces that could connect actually do so). With these assumptions the estimated base case \nphysical project EIRR is \u20136.3%. The EIRR of the total project, including institutional change to \nensure use, is 9.8%.  \n \n62.  Due to the low base level, sensitivity tests indicate that the economic viability is not \nparticularly robust to adverse changes, as shown in Table A10.4. The difference between the \nEIRRs with and without backlog connections indicates how important it will be to ensure that all who \ncould use the system do. \n \n63.  It is probable that these comparatively low levels are because not all the environmental etc \nbenefits are captured by the assumed land value increases. This will apply particularly to users of \npresently polluted streams and coastal areas, all of whom would have some willingness to pay to be \nable to use unpolluted waters. \n \nTable A12. 4: Economic Sensitivity Analysis for Sewerage Master Plan \nItem  Change  EIRR  Switching Value \nA.

The net economic flows for the water supply and sewerage \nmaster plans were combined to provide an EIRR for the overall project. The estimated EIRR is \n15.8%, including allowance for decreased sales due to tariff increases and the benefits of \ninstitutional reform.

Financial Analysis \n \n1.  Water Supply  \n \n15.  The water supply financial analysis has been conducted for both the physical project and \nthe institutional project. The latter will increase the efficiency of revenue collection and so will \nprovide benefits to both project and nonproject cash flow.  Agreement was reached during the \nappraisal mission that consideration could be given to tariff increases once the benefits of the \nproject start to become obvious to customers, and this point has been reached. The criterion \nused was to set the FIRR above the 4% weighted average cost of capital. This would ensure the \nlong-term viability of the project but would not ensure that cash flows are available at all times to \nmeet capital, operating, and debt service requirements on an annual basis. This would require \nanalysis of the cash flows of the enterprise as a whole. That in turn would require decisions as \nto the nature of the enterprise and the extent to which it would be charged with meeting debt \npayments. \n \n16.  In addition to revenues from decreased losses provided by the physical project, the \ninstitutional  part  of  the  project  will  provide  revenues  from  increased  revenue  collection \nefficiency. The assumptions made for the latter are: 2003, 57% (2002 actual); 2004, 60%; 2005, \n70%; 2006, 75%; 2007, 80%; 2008, 85%; 2009, 90%; 2010 plus, 95%.

The application of four efficiency levels, applied both with and without nonproject sales, \ngives the eight possible FIRRs per project and per tariff level. They are shown in Table A10.7 \nfor the 5-year ADB project and the master plan. For the latter, they are shown at present tariff \nlevels and for the master plan with a 60% tariff increase in 2006, sufficient to provide an FIRR \nfor the combined water and sewerage project of 4% (the weighted average cost of capital). \n   \n \nTable A12.7: Effects of Collection Efficiency on the Water Supply FIRR \n    ADB  Project  Master  Plan  Master  Plan \nTariff \nItem    Existing  Tariffs  Existing  Tariffs  60% Increase  in 2006 \nPlus Non  Plus Non  Plus \nCollection  Project  Project  Project  Project  Project  NonProject \nAlternative  Efficiency  Sales  Revenues  Sales  Revenues  Sales  Revenues \nPresent  64%  negative  negative  -9.4%  -9.4%  -1.4%  -1.4% \nDepartment  85%  -4.9%  2.2%  -3.0%  1.3%  1.7%  4.3% \nCorporate  96%  -2.4%  5.5%  -1.2%  4.2%  2.9%  6.7% \nAssumed  rising to 95% in 2010  -2.7%  4.0%  -1.4%  3.1%  2.6%  5.6% \nSource: Appraisal Mission estimates.

If this is the case, the FIRR for the \nADB project would be negative with present efficiency and minus 2.7% with assumed efficiency. \nThe FIRR for the master plan would be minus 1.4% with assumed efficiency and minus 9.4% \nwith present efficiency. The tariff increase in 2006 required to raise the water and sewerage \nmaster plan FIRR to 4.0% would be 60% with assumed efficiency and around 100% with \npresent efficiency. It would give a water supply FIRR of 5.6%. \n \n20.  These required increases demonstrate the importance of efficiency change. They also \nimply that without them, the physical project will simply not succeed. For this reason alone, it is \nbetter to think of the project as including institutional change. In this case the ADB project FIRR \nis 4.0% with present tariffs. The master plan project is 3.1% with present tariffs and 5.6% with \nthe 60% tariff increase in 2006 required to set the overall FIRR equal to the weighted average \ncost of capital. \n \n21.

The capital and operating cost streams include taxes and duties. Unit financial benefits \nare based on the present tariff which is F$0.198 and F$0.225 per cubic meter m3 of water \nconsumed for domestic and commercial customers, respectively. These rates are applied to \ncustomers identified as being connected to the sewer system. Identification and collection are \nboth poor and at present only some 32% of the estimated revenue potential is collected. It is \nassumed that the tariff collection efficiency will improve only marginally to 40% in 2005, when \ncorporatization should occur. It is then assumed to increase more rapidly to 95% in 2009. In \norder to maintain consistency between the sectors the same 60% tariff increase in 2006 \nassumed for water is also assumed for sewerage. \n \n23.  The sewerage program is long term and it is all but impossible to separately identify the \nrevenues that would accrue from the ADB-funded 5-year project.

This applies even with the 60% tariff increase in ", "  Appendix 12  55 \n2006 calculated as necessary to give overall master plan project financial viability. This is not a \nreasonable assumption, however, so the financial analysis of the sewerage component is based \non the investments and benefits identified  in the master plan. The investments have been \nadjusted to allow for the presently expected costs of the immediate 5-year project. \n \n24.  In spite of the assumed efficiency increases, the estimated base case FIRR is not \ncalculable since revenues would never be more than costs. This means that for any form of \nfinancial viability tariffs would have to be increased. No increase would be required to cover \ndirect operation and maintenance; 135% increase would be needed to cover operation and \nmaintenance plus salaries and wages; and a factor of 18 increase would be needed for full cost \nrecovery.   \n \n3.

The initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared as part of the feasibility study1 \nthat was completed in 1998. Due to the length of time since the IEE was prepared and the \naddition and deletion of some components from the Project, the Project was reassessed during \nthe  Appraisal  Mission2  and  the  summary  IEE  (Supplementary  Appendix  M)  reflects  the \nappraisal\u2019s  conclusions  and  recommendations  as  well  those  of  the  IEE.  This  appendix \nsummarizes the findings of both the IEE and the summary IEE. \n \nA.  Institutional Requirements  \n \n2.  Environmental legislation and control in the Fiji Islands are in their infancy. There is no \nnational  water  quality  policy  or  management  strategy,  and  no  water  or  land  resource \nmanagement legislation, environmental impact assessment (EIA), or management legislation. In \nsome instances, sectoral legislation incorporates environmental management components, e.g., \nEIAs are called for through the Town and Country Planning Act 1946; however, it is not legally \nbinding, and the development of in-house or corporate environmental management strategies \nand codes of environmental practice (COEPs) is becoming increasingly common. Two key \nitems of environmental legislation are under development: the Sustainable Development Bill and \nthe  Public  Health  Pollution  Control  Bill.  The  former  addresses  overall  environmental \nmanagement and policies, including EIA, and the latter addresses waste management, pollutant \ndischarges, and monitoring. \n \n3.  The Public Works Department (PWD) has adopted in-house standards for water quality \nand sewerage effluent. These standards are well founded and useful as an interim measure, but \nthere is little or no incentive to achieve compliance. Also, PWD) lacks the capacity to supervise \ncompliance.  \n4.  The Project includes several activities to improve, the environmental performance of \nPWD and its successors, including (i) introduction of an appropriate environmental management \nframework,  through  the  promulgation  of  its  own  COEP;  (ii)  establishing  an  environmental \nsection; and (iii) upgrading of the National Water Quality Laboratory (NWQL). \n   \nB.  Water Quality Monitoring Program \n \n5.  A water quality monitoring program, related mainly to the chemical and microbiological \nquality of water supplies, is maintained by the NWQL, which is managed by the Water and \nSewerage Department. This program is frustrated by lack of equipment, training, and resources. \nIt will be improved by increasing and making routine the monitoring of water treatment plant \nsludge and backwash water; sewage sludge; and pesticides, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium. A \n\u201cnoncompliance procedure\u201d and a quality assurance program also will be developed. \n \n6.  Water  quality  monitoring  will  be  undertaken  early  in  the  Project  to  establish  solid \nbaseline data provide for monitoring of project effects, e.g., urban streams near failing pump \nstations and sewers, near the Kinoya treatment plant outfall, near water treatment plant outfalls. \nThe monitoring program will be  designed to be an integral part of the water and sewerage \nutilities  and  Ministry  of  Health  or  Department  of  Environment\u2019s  monitoring  program.  Water \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Suva Nausori Water Supply and Sewerage. Final Feasibility Study. Manila. \n2  1 April to 16 April 2003. ", "58  Appendix 14 \nquality  monitoring  will  also  be  undertaken  during  construction  to  ensure  that  erosion  and \nsedimentation mitigation measures are effective and that construction does not result sewage \nspills or overflows. Water quality and effluent data will be made available to the Department of \nEnvironment and to the general public. \n \nC.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n7.  Public consultations during the feasibility study focused on the issues of land availability \nand social impact assessment of the various project components. In particular, the feasibility \nstudy team met with village leaders and a group of women fisherfolk in the Rewa River area. \nSuch consultation with the affected communities will be an ongoing process under the Project. \n \nD.  Findings and Recommendations of the IEE \n \n8.  The findings of the IEE of the proposed Project are as follows: \n \n(i)  The current water supply system provides water of adequate quality. However, the \nsystem is failing to provide a reliable supply and is not meeting the demand for new \nconnections. \n(ii)  A new raw water source is needed based on  the feasibility study, and the Rewa \nwater intake is the most suitable location, but additional modelling and environmental \nassessment should be undertaken during detailed design to confirm safe yields and \nidentify the most appropriate environmental controls as well as to continue public \nconsultations. \n(iii)  The condition of the sewerage infrastructure is poor and there is a serious and \nincreasing public health risk from wide-scale leakage of raw and partly treated \nsewage.  Continued  and  increasing  levels  of  sewage  containing  high  levels  of \nnutrients and industrial contaminants are leaked to creeks, waterways, and the \ninshore environment with serious impacts on the aquatic ecology. \n(iv)  The Project has the potential to make a major beneficial impact in reducing public \nhealth  hazards  and  improving  the  aquatic  biology  of  creeks  and  the  inshore \nenvironment. \n(v)  Water quality monitoring must be undertaken early in the Project to establish solid \nbaseline data with specific attention to project-affected areas, i.e., urban streams \nnear failing sewers and pump stations and near the Kinoya wastewater treatment \nplant outfall. The monitoring program should be designed to be an integral part of the \nwater and sewerage utilities and Ministry of Health or Department of Environment \nmonitoring program.  \n(vi)  PWD\u2019s current environmental management capability is inadequate.  \n(vii)  Environmental controls during construction and operation of the river water intake will \nbe  important  to  protecting  the  Kai  (fresh  water  mussels)  fisheries  and  the \ncommunities that depend on them. \n \n9.  The following recommendations of the IEE and summary IEE will be implemented: \n(i)  In line with its existing environmental management approach, and with the draft \nSustainable Development Bill, PWD will draw up a COEP, based on the International \nStandards Organisation 14000 series.  \n(ii)  An environmental management plan (EMP) for the entire Project will be prepared \nduring detailed design. The EMP will include identification of potential impacts, ", "  Appendix 14  59 \nspecific mitigation measures, monitoring program for during and postconstruction, \nbudgets for environmental measures and monitoring, and a public consultation and \nreporting  program.  EMP  implementation  will  be  a  specific  and  performance-\nevaluation element of all civil works contracts.  \n(iii)  A detailed environmental assessment will be undertaken, with particular attention to \nthe Rewa water intake, to support the development of the EMP, confirm preliminary \ndesigns, and identify the most appropriate environmental controls as well as continue \npublic  consultations.  Funds  will  not  be  disbursed  for  the  Rewa  water  intake \ncomponent until an EMP satisfactory to the Government and the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) has been prepared.  \n(iv)  The Project will provide a technical specialist to help PWD to prepare the COEP and \nprovide training to its staff. \n(v)  Adequate residual flow for aquatic ecology needs to be left in the Waimanu River \nduring very low flows. A policy for the quantum of residual flows will be a component \nof the COEP. To ensure that adequate flows can be left, the system will have the \ncapacity to transfer off-take to the Rewa River source during very low flows in the \nWaimanu River. \n(vi)  A rigorous ongoing monitoring program will be implemented for pollutants in streams \nused as water sources, and this information will be available to the public.  \n(vii)  The current use of copper sulphate during water treatment to minimize algae growth \nwill be phased out as soon as possible. \n(viii)  The sludge deposition site at the Waila water treatment plant will be chemically \ncharacterized and rehabilitated if it is contaminated. \n(ix)  Effluent (backwash water) from the Tamavua and Waila water treatment plants will \nbe collected and disposed of in an environmentally safe manner.  \n(x)  A rigorous regular (monthly or quarterly) monitoring program will be developed for \nwater quality in the streams in the project area, and for Laucala Bay receiving \nwaters, including Suva and Walu bays, and this information will be available to the \npublic.  At  a  minimum,  the  water  quality  monitoring  program  will  include  typical \nsewage  contaminants  such  as  biochemical  oxygen  demand,  total  and  fecal \ncoliforms, suspended solids, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorous,  \n(xi)  PWD will upgrade its attitude and ability to respond to sewage overflows.  \n(xii)  NWQL  will  be  upgraded  and  several  changes  will  be  made  to  its    monitoring \nprogram. \n(xiii)  Sewage sludge from the Kinoya sewage treatment plant will be stored on a prepared \nsite at Kinoya according to the sludge management strategy. Sludge disposal will be \na component of PWD\u2019s COEP, and the sludge will be analyzed on at least a monthly \nbasis. Odor complaints from the plant\u2019s neighbours will be recorded and, if found to \nbe excessive, the disposal strategy will be reviewed. \n(xiv)  The Sewerage Act will be amended to ensure connection by industry and house \nowners to sewer lines when they are put in place. \n(xv)  The Sustainable Development Bill and the Public Health and Pollution Control Bill or \nother legal measures will be finalized and submitted to Parliament.  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nE.  Conclusions \n \n10.  The Project will have a positive benefit to the environment through substantial reduction \nof  sewage  presently  entering  the  groundwater,  steams,  and  the  sea  due  to  inadequate \ntreatment in septic tanks, pump station and pipeline failures, and lack of water treatment plant \nsludge disposal facilities. The improvements in coastal water quality possible through the \nsewerage components of this Project are closely linked to the extension of the sewage outfall \nthat is being funded by the European Union.   \n \n11.  Sustainable improvements in stream, ground, and marine water quality will be supported \nthrough  project  works  and  the  enactment  of  key  environmental  legislation,  including  the \nSustainable Development Bill and the Public Health and Pollution Control Bill, or other legal \nmeasures, which will help clarify and strengthen the basis for regulation and control of waste \ndischarges. The strengthening of the PWD\u2019s water quality laboratory and improvement of \nPWD\u2019s environmental guidelines will help ensure the monitoring of project impacts and benefits, \nand the sustainability of the Projects\u2019 water quality benefits. The Project will upgrade PWD\u2019s \nenvironmental  management  capacity,  and  will  establish  a  sound  operating  policy  and \nimplementation framework. \n \n12.  The IEE has been thoroughly carried out, environmental issues have been identified, \nand mitigation strategies have been included in the Project. It is not considered that an ADB EIA \nneeds to be conducted. However, environmental assessments acceptable to ADB and the \nGovernment should be carried out as a basis for EMPs, acceptable to ADB, for all project \ncomponents with particular attention given to the Rewa River water intake.   \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R265-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20031128173822Z", "Title": "R265-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20040115162800+08'00'"}}
