INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  regional  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  is \ndesigned to increase knowledge, promote innovation and good practice, and identify priorities \nfor scaling up climate-resilient investments in South Asia and Southeast Asia. The TA will \nimprove  understanding  of  climate  risks  to  critical  infrastructure1 in  the  region  and  identify \ninvestment priorities to increase resilience to climate change. The project will focus on the road \nand water transport, conventional energy generation and hydropower, and water supply and \nflood  protection  subsectors.  The  TA  will  also  assess  technology,  policy,  and  knowledge \nsolutions to the need to make infrastructure investments more resilient to the effects of climate \nchange. These will include engineering measures; ecosystem-based adaptation; technology; \nand financial delivery, insurance, and risk transfer mechanisms.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Emerging markets  and low-income  countries  continue to  need  large  investments  in \ninfrastructure to remove constraints on growth; create job opportunities; respond to urbanization \npressures; and meet crucial development, inclusion, and environmental goals. In 2009, ADB \nestimated that an infrastructure investment of $8 trillion would be required during 2010\u20132020 to \nmaintain current levels of growth in Asia.3 Other estimates have put the need at $5.36 trillion a \nyear by 2025, or almost 60% of the overall global infrastructure investment requirements. The \nbulk of these needs are in energy, water, and transport infrastructure.4 \n \n3.  Infrastructure for transport and communications, energy generation and transmission, \nand the supply of water and sanitation are critical for development. These types of infrastructure \nusually have long service lives, which renders both the region\u2019s existing infrastructure stocks \nand its future infrastructure investments vulnerable to changes in climate conditions that may \ntake place in the near and medium terms. One of five overarching reasons for concern cited by \nthe fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2014 was the \nexistence  of  systemic  risks  \u201cdue  to  extreme  weather  events  leading  to  breakdown  of \ninfrastructure networks and critical services such as electricity, water supply, and health and \nemergency services.\u201d5 \n \n4.  Due to its vast and varied geography, Asia and the Pacific will experience most of the \nprojected  climate  change  impacts,  particularly  the  increased  risk  of  submergence,  coastal \nflooding, and coastal erosion in coastal systems and low-lying areas. By 2060, 729 million\u2013983 \nmillion people are projected to be living in low-elevation coastal zones in Asia.6 Inland ports, \nseaports, roads, rail, airports, energy and water supply, energy distribution, storm water and \nsewerage systems, and other infrastructure assets are highly sensitive to slow-onset climate \nchange. This includes gradual increases in air temperature and sea levels. They are equally \n                                                \n1  The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction defines critical facilities as \u201cthe primary physical structures, \ntechnical facilities and systems which are socially, economically or operationally essential to the functioning of a \nsociety or community, both in routine circumstances and in the extreme circumstances of an emergency.\u201d \nhttp://www.unisdr.org/files/7817_UNISDRTerminologyEnglish.pdf \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 27 September 2016. \n3  ADB and ADB Institute. 2009.

", "2 \nvulnerable to such extreme events as flooding from heavy precipitation, high winds, and storm \nsurges. A detailed understanding of the impacts of climate change on critical infrastructure is of \ngreat importance, since it can inform the continued and sustainable development of ADB\u2019s \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in South Asia and Southeast Asia. \n \nIII.  THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n5.  The TA will help to address emerging development challenges identified in the 2014 \nmidterm review of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 and meet an ADB priority to scale-up support for \nclimate-resilient development in its DMCs.7 The TA will expand ADB\u2019s knowledge dialogue with \nthe DMCs for country programming. It will provide information for use in planning development \nprograms and investment strategies in the target DMCs, and adaptation solutions by sector and \ninvestment needs. The TA will also inform ADB\u2019s preparation of a long-term strategic framework \nto  succeed  Strategy  2020.  The  TA  will  support  ADB\u2019s  efforts  to  scale  up  climate-resilient \ninvestments in the region and meet its annual climate adaptation finance target of $2 billion by \n2020. By the TA project\u2019s completion, ADB and DMCs will have a fuller understanding of the \nactions and innovation needed to make critical infrastructure in South Asia and Southeast Asia \nmore resilient to climate change. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The  impact  will  be  scaled-up  support  for  effective  climate  change  adaptation.  The \noutcome will be knowledge base on climate change risks to critical infrastructure enhanced in \nSouth Asia and Southeast Asia. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The  TA  will  build  on  the  current  understanding  of  climate  change  impacts  on  the \neconomy in South Asia and Southeast Asia, ongoing TA projects supported by ADB,8 and the \nknowledge already available to help developing countries transition on to a low-carbon, climate-\nresilient development path.9  \n \n8.  The TA will have three outputs. \n \n9.  Output 1: Critical infrastructure in the energy, transport, and water sectors in \nSouth Asia and Southeast Asia identified. The TA will identify critical existing infrastructure \nassets and facilities in the energy, transport, and water sectors in South Asia and Southeast \nAsia. The TA will develop a methodology and criteria for establishing which infrastructure is \ncritical to the social and economic development of the targeted subregions and/or is part of key \neconomic corridors. A framework for analyzing the long-term performance of interdependent \ninfrastructure  systems  will  be  developed.  The  approach  developed  will  be  based  on \nmethodologies already tested in the region and globally. These include (i) dependence matrixes \nthat represent the probability of each asset in a complex system being seriously disrupted \ndirectly  or  indirectly  by  propagation  effects  of  the  disruption  of  another  asset;  and  (ii) \nconsequence criteria, such as the concentration of people who would be affected by disruption, \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014.

ADB will select the methodology to be used with the support of TA consultants and \ncenters of excellence during the first 5 months of TA implementation. The TA will then identify \ncritical infrastructure in the energy, transport, and water sectors for the target subregions, \nfocusing on the road and water transport, conventional energy generation and hydropower, and \nwater  supply  and  flood  protection  subsectors  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  The  assets \nidentified will be cataloged through databases, simulation modeling, and visualization tools. A \nroad  map  of  planned  infrastructure  will  be  developed  based  on  demand  for  infrastructure \nservices and relevant national development strategies. \n \n11.  Output 2: Climate change risks to existing and planned critical infrastructure in \nthe energy, transport, and water sectors in South Asia and Southeast Asia assessed. The \nTA will assess climate change risks in South Asia and Southeast Asia to existing and planned \ncritical infrastructure in the energy, transport, and water sectors. Based on this analysis, the \nproject will select pilot areas in the two regions for further study. The pilot areas will cover a mix \nof countries with medium and low income, and have a variety of geographical characteristics, \nincluding coastal, mountainous, and other topographies. The TA will undertake a  detailed, \nspatially explicit assessment of climate change risks, including weather-induced disaster risks, \nto existing and planned critical infrastructure assets, as well as the services they provide and \nthe communities they serve. \n \n12.   The assessment will consider climate change scenarios for three time periods\u20142016\u2212 \n2030, 2030\u22122050, and 2050\u22122080\u2014drawing on existing climate and projections data sets, \nincluding the United States\u2019 National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s Earth Exchange \nGlobal  Daily  Downscaled  Projections.10 Climate  scenarios  will  be  used  to  assess  climate \nchange  impacts  on  the  critical  infrastructure  the  project  identifies  and  the  services  and \npopulations these assets serve. The TA will analyze the risks that will arise if interdependent \ninfrastructure networks fail due to current climate variability and future climate change. Existing \nassessment tools and models will be used to the greatest extent possible. Climate change \ninformation  will  be  made  available  electronically  on  an  interactive  geographic  information \nsystem (GIS) platform that will be developed under the TA and will target climate change \nadaptation practitioners in DMCs that are involved in the design and/or climate risk assessment \nof infrastructure projects.11 \n \n13.  Output 3: Policy, financial priorities, adaptation options, and climate resilience \nstandards for the target sectors identified. The TA will identify policy, financial priorities, \nadaptation options, and climate resilience standards for the target sectors. The TA will formulate \nrecommendations  on  governance,  policy,  regulatory,  and  financial  measures  that  can  be \ndeployed to strengthen climate resilience and avoid leaving critical infrastructure assets and \ntheir services vulnerable to the long-term effects of climate change. Based on the project\u2019s \nassessment of the vulnerability of existing infrastructure and available information, the TA will   \nexamine approaches to climate risk management, including those developed by ADB and other \nfinancial institutions, and potential engineering and non-engineering adaptation measures. The \nTA will examine engineering solutions and adaptation measures based on high technology that \n                                                \n10 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Climate Data Service.

Non-engineering measures will include ecosystem-\nbased adaptation that can be retrofitted to existing infrastructure and applied to the design of \nnew infrastructure to increase resilience to climate change and disaster risk. The project will \nalso develop performance indicators that can be used to measure the effectiveness of climate-\nresilient infrastructure designs.  \n \n14.  The project will develop climate resilience design metrics or standards for the target \nsectors, taking into account the different needs and national circumstances and work done by \nother institutions to design resilient infrastructure.12 Case studies will be produced for three \nDMCs to demonstrate the benefits of investing in climate resilience. The studies will examine \ninvestments in the transport, energy and water sectors that can be considered for the three \ncountries\u2019 programming and investment pipelines. The three countries will be selected from \namong the pilot DMCs within the geographical areas identified under output 1. They will be \nhighly  vulnerable  to  the  effects  of  climate  change  and  be  at  three  different  levels  of \ndevelopment\u2014i.e., a low-income DMC, a low-income country transitioning to middle-income \nstatus, and a middle-income DMC.  \n \n15.  The TA will conduct outreach activities, such as workshops and knowledge dialogues, to \nraise the awareness of stakeholders in the region of the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to \nclimate change and to inform them of the TA findings. The TA will increase the capacity of \ndecision makers from the public and private sectors not only to anticipate climate risk, but also \nto appreciate the net benefits of investing in climate resilience. A knowledge product on design \nfeatures for climate-proofing infrastructure in the region and summaries for policy makers will be \nproduced and disseminated at regional and international events. \n \n16.  Several risks exist to the achievement of the intended outputs and outcome. Knowledge \ngenerated by the TA may not be transferred to the relevant line ministries in targeted DMCs. \nThe availability of detailed data on critical infrastructure may be limited. The impact modeling at \nan appropriate scale of resolution may require more time to complete and absorb more TA \nresources than planned. ADB will mitigate these by facilitating knowledge dissemination in \ntargeted  DMCs,  sourcing  expert knowledge  on  infrastructure  assets  and facilities from  the \nregion,  allocating  sufficient  budget  and  contingency  for  infrastructure  mapping  and  impact \nmodeling, and disseminating knowledge to relevant government stakeholders in the selected \nDMCs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which $1,340,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others) and $160,000 by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  executing  agency. 13  The  Climate  Change  and  Disaster  Risk \nManagement Division of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will be \nthe implementing agency and will administer the TA and coordinate with ADB\u2019s South Asia \n                                                \n12 This includes work on climate adaptation standards being undertaken by the International Organization for \nStandardization and the standard for sustainable and resilient infrastructure developed by the Global Infrastructure \nBasel Foundation. \n13 Prior to commencing or financing of any proposed activities under the TA, a no-objection in writing will be obtained \nfrom each selected DMC. \n ", "5 \nDepartment, Southeast Asia Department, Private Sector Operations Department, and relevant \nresident missions. The Climate  Change  and  Disaster  Risk  Management  Division  will  work \nclosely with the transport, energy, urban, and water sector groups to generate practical and \noperation-oriented solutions. A TA coordination unit of representatives from relevant operations \ndepartments and sector groups may be established to help implement the TA activities. \n \n19.  Centers of excellence will provide the core research and practices that will underpin the \nachievement of outputs 1 and 2. Researchers from the United Kingdom Met Office may provide \n(i)  an  assessment  of  historical  climate  and  climate  model  projections  for  South  Asia  and \nSoutheast Asia, including an assessment of the adequacy of available data and coherence \nacross models; (ii) identification of climate change hot spots in South Asia and Southeast Asia \nwhere  the magnitude  and/or rate  of climate  change  are  likely  to create  challenges to  the \nphysical integrity and/or performance of critical infrastructure; and (iii) input to the development \nof geo-spatial coverage, summarizing climate-related risks that can serve as a basis for national \nand sector planning.14  \n \n20.  The Infrastructure Transitions Research Consortium of the University of Oxford and \nother centers of excellence may (i) develop criteria to identify and catalog critical infrastructure \nin South Asia and Southeast Asia; (ii) develop a case study to demonstrate how the developed \nmethodologies on critical infrastructure can be effectively applied in a national infrastructure \nassessment; (iii) identify relevant concepts, models, and tools needed to identify and test robust, \nsustainable, and climate-resilient infrastructure design standards for the provision of national \ninfrastructure; and (iv) provide input to the assessment of policy, financial, engineering, and \nnon-engineering solutions to increase the climate resilience of infrastructure in South Asia and \nSoutheast Asia. Other centers of excellence may provide key resources and international best \npractices. Procedures for knowledge partnerships will be aligned with ADB guidelines currently \nunder development. Input from utilities and facility managers from the public and private sectors \nwill be sought through such existing mechanisms as the ADB Water Operators Partnerships \nProgram to facilitate knowledge sharing and ensure that the climate-resilient solutions identified \nby the TA are operational and replicable. \n \n21.  The TA will require 23 person-months of international and 36 person-months of national \nconsultant inputs. Consultants will be engaged as individuals and as firms following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The project will \nrequire expertise in multiple areas, including (i) climate risk and vulnerability assessment; (ii) \nclimate risk management; (iii) adaptation planning; (iv) disaster risk management; (v) water, \nenergy, and transport infrastructure planning and systems; (vii) climate change economics; and \n(vii)  GIS. TA disbursements will be made following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA will be implemented from October \n2016 to June 2019. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Building Climate Change Resilience in Asia\u2019s Critical Infrastructure, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n                                                \n14 ADB and the United Kingdom Met Office signed a letter of intent in February 2015 to strengthen cooperation in \nhelping developing countries in Asia and the Pacific to address climate vulnerability and in promoting climate-\nresilient development. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nScaled-up support for effective climate change adaptation (Midterm Review of Strategy 2020)a \n  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting  Risks \nOutcome       \nKnowledge base of  a.
