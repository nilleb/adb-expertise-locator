INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of Mongolia requested policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Developing a Conducive Environment for Public\u2013\nPrivate Partnerships (PPPs). Following a reconnaissance mission to Ulaanbaatar during 10\u201314 \nSeptember 2012 and a fact-finding mission on 19 October 2012, ADB and the government \nreached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangement, costs, and \nterms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A lack of infrastructure in many places and rapidly deteriorating infrastructure in others \nundermine  Mongolia\u2019s  competitiveness.  The  government  has  identified  PPPs  as  a  way  to \naccelerate development by improving infrastructure and, more broadly, the delivery of public \nservices. Important steps have been taken in recent years to establish the enabling environment \nneeded for successful PPPs. \n \n3.  In  2009,  Parliament  adopted  a  state  policy  on  PPPs,  which  comprises  a  set  of \nresolutions  that  established  the  principles  governing  PPPs.  It  covers  (i)  the  stages  of \nimplementation, (ii) the types of PPP arrangements to be utilized, (iii) the legal framework, and \n(iv) project management. In 2010, Parliament adopted the Law on Concessions to regulate the \ntendering process and define the rights and obligations of PPP participants in a practical, \ntransparent fashion. The law was crafted in line with global best practice to lower risk, instill \nconfidence, and improve the investment climate for PPPs. It also laid out the responsibilities and \npowers of the Department of Public\u2013Private Partnerships and Concessions (PPP Unit) within \nthe State Property Committee. The unit became operational in 2011. \n \n4.  Continued strengthening is needed to realize the potential contribution from PPPs. A \n2011 regional study of the enabling environment for PPPs ranked Mongolia in the \u201cnascent\u201d \ncategory of countries.2 The study, supported by ADB, noted that the enabling environment for \nPPPs was weakened by (i) the absence of a completed PPP since 2001; (ii) gaps in the legal \nand regulatory framework; (iii) below-market prices for energy, water, and transport; (iv) a lack \nof  the  expertise  needed  to  design  and  implement  PPPs;  and  (v)  underdeveloped  capital \nmarkets. The study acknowledged the importance of the Concessions Law and the PPP Unit as \ninitial steps to improving the enabling environment for PPPs, but concluded that additional \ncapacity building and reform is required.  \n \n5.  The government\u2019s action plan for 2012\u20132016 commits to a heightened role for  PPPs.3 In \na recent restructuring of agencies under the new government, the functions of the PPP Unit \nwere  transferred  from  the  State  Property  Committee  to  the  Innovation  and  Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships (IPPP) Department in the new Ministry of Economic Development (MED). The \ngovernment\u2019s  investment  and  planning  functions  have  been  consolidated  under  MED  to \nstreamline and coordinate medium- and long-term strategic planning. The IPPP Department and \nthe Development Policy and Strategic Planning (DPSP) Department, which has taken over the \nrole of the former National Development and Innovation Committee, will form the institutional \npillars of infrastructure planning in the new government. Thus, the restructuring elevated the \n                                                \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 21 November 2012. \n2  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2011.

The  preparation  of  pathfinder  PPPs  is  complementing  efforts  to  improve  the \nmanagement of PPPs within the government. The government has prepared a list of candidate \nPPPs, and development partners have been helping prepare priority PPPs. In June 2011, ADB \nwas appointed to advise the government in structuring the PPP for the Combined Heat and \nPower Plant Number 5 on a build-operate-transfer basis.5 The plant is to meet the growing \nenergy demand resulting from rapid urbanization and economic development; it will also reduce \nurban air pollution by retiring older, less efficient plants.6 The project illustrates the potential for \nPPPs to bring in a high-quality, experienced operator to share project risk and to mobilize \nadditional  financial  resources.  International  investors  are  closely  watching  this  and  other \npathfinder projects as an indicator of Mongolia\u2019s readiness for PPPs. \n \n7.  In  addition  to  assisting  on  this  major  pathfinder  PPP,  ADB  has  made  important \ncontributions  to  the  development  of  the  enabling  environment.  The  first  phase  of  ADB \nassistance helped develop the core of the legal and institutional framework for PPPs, and \ncontributed to the development of the Concessions Law and the establishment of the PPP Unit.7 \nThe second phase strengthened the capacity of the PPP Unit and supported the preparation of \na  PPP  handbook  to  explain  how  the  government  can  identify  PPP  projects,  structure  the \nprojects, procure them, and monitor and enforce the PPP arrangements. The TA also supported \nthe preparation of a workbook for the PPP Unit and facilitated outreach to line ministries and the \nfirming up of the PPP project pipeline.8  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2012\u20132016 aims to achieve inclusive \nand sustainable growth.9 Support for PPPs will assist by bringing in private financing for the \ninfrastructure needed to improve access to essential public services in transport, energy, and \nwater  supply,  as  well  as  other  municipal  infrastructure.  This  will  ease  bottlenecks  in  the \neconomy, resulting in more equitable and efficient growth. Private sector development, which is \nexpected to play a significant role in achieving the strategic objectives of the government and \nADB, will be fostered through support for PPPs.  \n \n9.  Mongolia needs assistance to continue strengthening its legal, policy, and institutional \nframework in order to develop a conducive environment for PPPs. The priorities are to (i) update \nthe framework for the recent government restructuring, (ii) pursue refinements to the PPP \nlegislation, (iii) improve the integration of PPP preparation with public investment planning, and \n(iv) build the capacity of MED staff. The preparation of new PPPs also needs to be initiated in \norder to meet urgent development needs, particularly in the capital, Ulaanbaatar City. Such \nassistance will contribute to the finalization of pathfinder PPPs, including the Combined Heat \nand Power Plant Number 5, and raise Mongolia\u2019s profile among international investors. \n \n                                                \n4   The State Property Committee is under the authority of the Prime Minister\u2019s office. While the previous structure \nassisted the alignment of PPP work with the Prime Minister\u2019s agenda, it created institutional problems because \nline ministries held the authority to prioritize and prepare public investments. \n5   Earlier assistance was provided by ADB. 2010.

The outcome of the TA will be a stronger human resource base and institutional, \nlegal, and regulatory framework for PPPs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  The TA will harmonize the legal and regulatory framework and planning process for \nPPPs with recent changes in the government structure, and build the capacity of government \nstaff to operate in this improved framework. Support will also be provided for prescreening \npriority  PPPs  and  preparing  terms  of reference for transaction  advisory  services. This  will \nadvance  the  PPP  pipeline  and  build  the  capacity  of  MED  through  a  \u201clearning-by-doing\u201d \napproach. \n \n12.  Recommendations for strengthening the legal and regulatory framework for PPPs will be \nprepared.  The  TA  will  review  the  legal  and  regulatory  amendments  recommended  under \nprevious TA projects and by other development partners. The laws that will be considered for \nreview  include  the  Concessions  Law,  the  Budget  Law,  the  Government\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines, and relevant sector laws. A desirable long-term evolution of the legal and regulatory \nframework will be mapped out, which will include an implementation time line that distinguishes \nbetween measures warranting immediate adoption and those of a longer-term nature. Based on \nthe review of previous recommendations and feedback from private and public stakeholders, the \nTA will draft and then assist in the adoption of amendments to the Concessions Law and other \nlaws. \n \n13.  The TA will help prepare guidelines that update the procedures for PPP planning and \nidentification in order to integrate the PPP and public investment planning processes. This will \ninclude preparation of an interdepartmental planning schedule with an indicative time line and a \nclearer allocation of responsibilities between departments, and the development of a detailed \nprocess flowchart. Specific items to be addressed include (i) coordination with line ministries for \ndeveloping and prioritizing PPP projects, (ii) the development and application of PPP screening \ncriteria, and (iii) coordination with the DPSP Department on the additional analysis required to \nassess project feasibility. The TA will support learning-by-doing by helping the IPPP and DPSP \ndepartments work through implementation of one planning cycle as a capacity building exercise. \n \n14.  The capacity development of MED staff will emphasize the IPPP Department. Drawing \non an assessment of staff capacity and needs, a training curriculum will be developed for the \nIPPP Department staff. This will develop their skills in risk analysis, risk allocation, financial and \neconomic  analysis,  value-for-money  assessment,  contingent  liability  valuation,  and  sector-\nspecific issues relevant to priority PPPs. The TA will utilize and update material prepared under \nprevious TA projects and will ensure coordination with MED\u2019s ongoing training on PPP issues \nwith Singapore International Enterprise. The TA will include staff of other MED departments and \ngovernment agencies in capacity development exercises relevant to their work.  \n \n15.  The TA will also fund the prescreening of priority PPPs. The PPP handbook identifies \nthe steps required to prepare a PPP. It provides for a prescreening of PPPs before feasibility \nstudies are conducted and transaction advisers are appointed. The prescreening process will \nassess whether a project is likely to deliver value for money by considering the scale of a \n ", "4   \nproject,  the  specificity  of  the  outputs,  risk  transfer  opportunities,  the  likelihood  of  financial \nviability and market interest in the project, and affordability for the government. The TA will be \nopen to funding the prescreening of projects where government ownership and expected project \nviability are high. The terms of reference for transaction advisory services will be prepared for \nthe prescreened PPPs that are to proceed. \n \n16.  The success of the TA in building the human resource base will be determined by \nwhether the staff of the IPPP Department have independently completed the prescreening of an \nadditional, simple PPP by completion of the TA project. \n \n17.  The TA will support targeted workshops and seminars to raise awareness among line \nministries and other government stakeholders at various stages of TA implementation, and to \ndisseminate findings and gather feedback on TA activities. Knowledge products will also be \nprepared in the form of short policy and technical notes. \n \n18.  The TA assumes that international investors remain open to engagement in PPPs in \nemerging markets, and that the government\u2019s support for PPPs continues. It also assumes that \nMED staff remain committed to developing PPPs and building their capacity in PPPs, and that \nthe ministry can obtain and retain sufficient human resources. The key risk is that political \nuncertainty may slow decision making on institutional, legal, and regulatory reforms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund IV (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of office space, counterpart staff, and other services to the \nconsultants; and will assist in arranging meetings with counterpart agencies. The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n \n20.  MED will be the executing and implementing agency for the TA. The IPPP Department \nwithin MED will provide overall guidance to the TA and be responsible for coordination. The TA \nwill work closely with MED\u2019s DPSP Department to integrate PPP planning into public investment \nplanning.  \n \n21.  A team of international consultants will be engaged for up to 12 person-months. It will \ninclude  a  team  leader  and  PPP  institutional  adviser,  a  PPP  legal  adviser,  a  capacity \ndevelopment adviser, and PPP expert(s). National consultants will be engaged for up to 51 \nperson-months.  They  will  include  a  deputy  team  leader,  a  legal  specialist,  a  capacity \ndevelopment  specialist,  and  technical  specialist(s).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 3. \n \n22.  The consultants will be recruited individually to ensure flexibility and timeliness. ADB will \nengage  the  international  and  national  consultants,  as  well  as  any  resource  persons,  in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nProcurement of equipment, if any, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010 as amended from time to time). \n \n ", "  5 \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from 1 January 2013 until 30 December \n2014. Support for the strengthening of the legal and regulatory framework, the integration of the \nPPP  and  public  investment  planning  processes,  and  capacity  building  will  take  place \nconcurrently. The initial assessment of institutional structures and knowledge gaps will occur \nwithin the first 3 months, with the implementation of required follow-on actions planned over the \nremainder of the TA period. The development of recommendations for amendments to the legal \nand  regulatory  framework  will  take  place  within  the  first  half  of  the  TA,  with  a  view  to \nimplementing  the  immediate  priorities  over  the  second  half  of  the  TA.  Prescreening \nassessments of priority PPPs will be completed within the first 18 months of the TA. \n \n24.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated based on the implementation of activities and \nsatisfactory delivery of outputs following the agreed time line and budget allocation. To support \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  the  consultant  team  will  submit  an  inception  report,  quarterly \nprogress notes, a midterm report, a draft final report, and a final report to the government and \nADB. The main mechanism to monitor progress, assess performance, and ensure relevance, \nwill be TA review missions. All knowledge products and services created by the TA will be \nprovided to MED and ADB for dissemination to the government and, as appropriate, other \nstakeholders. \n \n25.  The TA  will  be  implemented  in  close coordination  with  other  development  partners \nsupporting  PPPs  and  public  investment  in  Mongolia,  including  German  International \nCooperation,  the  International  Finance  Corporation,  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency,  and  the  World  Bank.  Outreach  activities  will  help  ensure  understanding  and \nengagement of these partners. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Mongolia  for  Developing  a  Conducive  Environment  for  Public\u2013Private \nPartnerships, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nDelivery of improved  At least two PPP  Budget papers and MED  International investors \npublic services to  transactions that will  reports  remain open to \npoorly serviced  modernize and expand  engagement in PPPs in \nInvestment program of \npopulations  public services reach  emerging markets \nUlaanbaatar mayor\u2019s \n  financial closure during \noffice  Risk \n2013\u20132016, at least one \nBudget constraints \nof which is in the  World Bank Private \nprevent the hiring of \nmunicipality of  Participation in \ntransaction advisors \nUlaanbaatar  Infrastructure database \nOutcome      Assumption \nStronger human  Mongolia graduates to  Asian Infrascope  Continuing government \nresource base and  the \u201cemerging\u201d nation  benchmarking index and  support for the delivery \ninstitutional, legal,  category of the Asian  learning toola  of public services \nand regulatory  Infrascope in 2014 (2011    through PPPs \nframework for PPPs  baseline: \u201cnascent\u201d \nRisk \n  category) \nPolitical uncertainty \n \nslows decision making \non institutional, legal, \nand regulatory reforms \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
