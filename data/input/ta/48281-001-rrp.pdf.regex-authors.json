I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \ndollar\u2013yuan loan facility of up to $450 million equivalent to China Gas Holdings Limited (CGH), \ncomprising (i) a dollar\u2013yuan A-loan of up to $150 million equivalent, and (ii) a dollar\u2013yuan \ncomplementary loan of up to $300 million equivalent, for the Natural Gas for Land and River \nTransportation Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n1.  Project Identification \n2.  Air pollution continues to be a major environmental challenge in the PRC. Less than 1% \nof the 500 main cities in the PRC meet the air quality standards recommended by the World \nHealth Organization.1 Although industrial emissions have stabilized in the past few years, a \nrapid increase in vehicular traffic volumes has created a new threat in the form of vehicle and \nvessel emissions. This factor, as well as the technological developments inspired by successful \ncases in Europe, has created renewed interest in the application of both compressed natural \ngas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the transport sector, since heavily polluting fuels \nsuch as diesel can be replaced with natural gas, which produces no particulate matter, 25% less \ncarbon dioxide, less than one-third as much nitrogen oxides, and 99% less sulfur dioxide than \nconventional fuel.  \n \n3.  CNG is suitable for short-distance inner-city transportation and, therefore, can be used \nby cars, taxis, and buses. LNG has superior energy density and is more appropriate for long-\ndistance  transportation,  such  as  long-distance  trucking.2 Furthermore,  there  is  untapped \npotential for further greening transportation using LNG for inland waterway transport (IWT). The \nPRC has the world\u2019s largest IWT network, both in terms of length and freight volume. Since \n2007, the government has emphasized improving IWT infrastructure to handle larger vessels, \nwhich would allow for greater transportation efficiency. LNG can replace diesel and bunker oil \nas an alternative fuel for long-distance IWT vessels. \n \n4.  The  PRC  per  capita  gas  consumption  is  still  among  the  lowest  of  gas-consuming \ncountries  in  Asia  and  the  rest  of  the  world,  despite  the  fact  that  the  PRC  has  abundant \nundeveloped natural gas reserves, estimated at approximately 3.1 trillion cubic meters.3 The \ngovernment is actively trying to increase natural gas usage as a part of the PRC\u2019s overall \nenergy mix,4 and specifically encourages its use in land and water transportation.5 While gas \nsupply\u2014both from domestic and international sources\u2014has increased, natural gas demand still \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2012.

", "2   \nremains unmet, largely because of a lack of distribution and refueling infrastructure, particularly \nin long-distance transport corridors which cross municipal and provincial boundaries. \n \n5.  In  response to  the  continued  environmental  challenges faced  by  the  PRC  and  the \ngovernment\u2019s desire to promote the use of natural gas in the transportation sector, sustainable \ntransportation has become a new focus area for the business development efforts of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). Through continuous project screening and discussion with private \nsector gas operators, ADB selected CGH as the ideal partner to develop natural gas distribution \ninfrastructure targeted at the transportation sector. CGH distinguished itself from its peers by \nhaving  (i)  greater  geographical  coverage,  including  in  least-developed  rural  areas;  (ii) \nsubstantial technical expertise in small-sized LNG refilling stations; and (iii) a clear strategy for \ngas distribution in IWT. \n \n2.  Project Design \n6.  The proposed project is designed to facilitate the use of natural gas as a transportation \nfuel  by  building  CNG  and  LNG  refueling  stations  along  long-distance  land  transportation \ncorridors and IWT networks in the PRC that cross municipal and provincial boundaries. With the \nproposed facility, CGH plans to build and operate subprojects of 600 CNG and 200 LNG filling \nstations for land-based vehicle use and another 20 LNG filling stations for IWT vessel use \nduring 2015\u20132018.   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n3.  The Borrower \n7.  CGH, the borrower of the ADB loan, is a company incorporated in Bermuda and listed \non the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.6 Following the government's 2002 policy to open natural \ngas  distribution  to  private  sector  investment,  CGH  has  focused  its  operations  on  the \nconstruction  and  operation  of  city  gas  pipelines  and  supply  of  natural  gas  to  residential, \nindustrial, and commercial end users, thereby replacing coal and coal gas usage. In FY2009, \nCGH entered the liquefied petroleum gas distribution business to become an integrated gas \ndistribution company. In FY2014, CGH had revenues of HK$26.0 billion ($3.4 billion), a gross \nprofit of HK$5.3 billion ($682 million), and a net profit of HK$3.0 billion ($384 million). \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n \n8.  Since  2006,  ADB  has been  closely  collaborating  with  CGH to  address  natural gas \ndemand  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities.  The  Municipal  Natural  Gas  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project Phase 1 provided a $25 million equity investment, a $50 million A-loan, \nand a $75 million B-loan for natural gas distribution to commercial and residential customers in \ncities.7 To meet the government\u2019s urban\u2013rural integration initiative, in 2010 ADB arranged phase \n                                                \n6   Bermuda is on the \u201cwhite list\u201d of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development jurisdictions, which \nhave substantially implemented the internationally agreed tax standard. Bermuda has passed phase 1 and phase 2 \npeer review by the Global Forum for Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes and been rated \nas a \u201clargely compliant\u201d jurisdiction. ADB's review of the entity does not give ADB cause to believe that such entity \nhas been established, or is being used for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the \njurisdictions involved in the project. \n7  ADB. 2006.

Currently, CGH operates 295 CNG vehicle refilling stations servicing inner-city public \ntransportation and 58 LNG vehicle refilling stations servicing long-distance, cross-provincial \ntransportation. Furthermore, CGH is implementing a pilot IWT LNG filling station along the \nYangtze River, which has the most river transportation traffic of any PRC inland waterway. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n10.  Impact. Successful implementation of the project and deployment of natural gas for \nmultimodal transportation will diversify the energy mix in the PRC by increasing the proportion of \nnatural gas, and increase the availability of natural gas as a transportation fuel in the country.  \n \n11.  Outcome.  The  outcome  will  be  development  of  a  commercially  viable  low-carbon \ntransport fuel system. The project is expected to generate new jobs and reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions while also acting as a catalyst for private sector participation in the sector. \n \n12.  Output.  The  expected  outputs  include  the  increased  availability  of  CNG  and  LNG \nstations meeting safeguards standards. The project will involve the construction and operation \nof 600 CNG and 200 LNG refueling stations for use by land-based vehicles and 20 LNG \nrefueling stations for IWT vessel use during 2015\u20132018, all of which will comply with ADB \nsafeguard standards and technical eligibility criteria.  \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n13.  Consistency with midterm review of Strategy 2020. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020, which identifies infrastructure and environment as two \nof the four strategic priorities to sharpen ADB\u2019s operational focus.9 Regarding infrastructure, the \nproject  is  in  line  with  the  midterm review\u2019s  focus  on  inclusive  growth,  as  well  as  with  its \nemphasis on public\u2013private partnership. Regarding the environment, the project mitigates air \npollution and health threats, and promotes environmentally sustainable growth. \n \n14.  Consistency with country strategy. By supporting environmental sustainability, the \nproject directly addresses key development goals of the PRC country partnership strategy10 and \naligns with the strategy\u2019s sector priority of pollution control. Environmental sustainability will \ncontinue to be a major strategic objective of ADB support to the PRC, as will the PRC\u2019s delivery \nof environmental regional and global public goods. The project strongly complements the ADB \nEast Asia Department\u2019s current initiatives in climate change mitigation energy projects and \ngreening transport portfolio.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n8  ADB. 2010.

ADB's Energy \nPolicy11 requires energy operations to be aligned with ADB's overall strategy of emphasizing \nenergy security, facilitating a transition to a low-carbon economy, universal access to energy, \nand  achieving  ADB\u2019s  vision  of  a  region  free  of  poverty.  The  policy  requires  ADB  to  help \ndeveloping member countries provide reliable, adequate, and affordable energy for inclusive \ngrowth in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way. It sets out three pillars \nfor policy implementation: (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy; (ii) maximizing \naccess  to  energy  for  all;  and  (iii)  promoting  energy  sector  reform,  capacity  building,  and \ngovernance. The proposed project is in line with the policy, as further penetration of natural gas \nwill contribute to promoting enhanced access to clean energy. It will also demonstrate ADB\u2019s \ncommitment  to  focusing  future  transport  sector  support  on  the  more  sustainable  forms  of \ntransport,  in  line  with  the  Sustainable  Transport  Initiative.12 The  project  will  serve  as  a \ndemonstration of the potential of natural gas for IWT use in the PRC and in other developing \nmember countries with IWT potential. \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n16.  CGH\u2019s land and river transportation sector investment plan indicates a total investment \nof  $1.1  billion  equivalent,  including  civil  works,  equipment  and  materials,  other  local \nprocurement, and working capital for 2015\u20132018.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory framework  The regulatory requirements for CNG and LNG refilling stations include approvals from \nthe Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission. The \nstations should comply with the applicable construction standards and safety regulations, \nand the operators should obtain licenses and permits such as gas operation licenses, \ngas supply licenses, and road transport permits for dangerous goods. For conversion of \ndiesel-based inland water vessels into LNG\u2013diesel dual-fuel vessels, approval by the \nChina Classification Society is also required.  \nManagement  CGH is led by a team of experienced and qualified managers, and will centrally control all \nproject development, procurement, and financing arrangements across its operations. \nCGH will be responsible for identifying, evaluating, selecting, negotiating, implementing, \nand administering each subproject.   \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nImplementation period  January 2015\u2013December 2018 \nConstruction  The goods and services will be required to be procured from contractors and suppliers \nfrom ADB member countries in a transparent manner, through competitive bidding \narrangements \nprocedures. \nOperation arrangements \nRevenue structure  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nSupply arrangements  [CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \nOperation and  The project will rely on CGH for its successful track record of operation and maintenance. \nCGH has experienced and competent in-house teams to undertake operation and \nmaintenance \nmaintenance of CNG and LNG refilling stations.  \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2009.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance \n18.  Each subproject has to satisfy CGH\u2019s minimum financial internal rate return (FIRR) \ntherefore the aggregate Project FIRR will also exceed the weighted average cost of capital The \nproject is economically sustainable as the economic return on invested capital is higher than the \nsocial discount rate of 12%. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n19.  ADB\u2019s proposed assistance consists of (i) an A-loan of up to $150 million equivalent in \ndollars and yuan, and (ii) a complementary loan of up to $300 million equivalent in dollars and \nyuan funded by participating banks with ADB acting as lender of record. The proposed A-loan \nwill have a maturity of up to 10 years from the date of the first disbursement.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n20.  The complementary loan will have a maturity equal to or shorter than that of the A-loan, \nand will be on terms and conditions to be agreed. The complementary loan syndication will be \nundertaken on a best-efforts basis.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \nB.  Value-Added by ADB Assistance \n21.  ADB\u2019s support is crucial to encourage the use of natural gas for multimodal transport \nsystems. The use of gas as a transportation fuel offers the opportunity to significantly mitigate \nclimate change. This approach has been successful in Europe, where major projects were \nimplemented to meet the strict emission standards on rivers such as the Rhine. However, LNG \nvehicles and vessels are new in Asia. ADB\u2019s support is expected to highlight this untapped \npotential  and  facilitate  development  in  distribution  and  refueling  infrastructure,  the  key \nbottleneck to CNG and LNG utilization. \n \n22.  Backed by rapidly evolving government policies, significant investments are required to \nrealize the technical and economic potential of natural gas in the PRC. Access to finance has \nbeen identified as one of the key bottlenecks to natural gas sector development. Commercial \nbanks are confronted with rapidly evolving technologies and emerging contractual structures \nthat challenge the tolerance of their credit committees. A further challenge for natural gas \ndistribution finance is the limited number of project sponsors compared to other infrastructure \nareas. Those companies are also undertaking investments in natural gas assets as diverse as \nupstream  development,  long-distance  pipelines,  and  liquefied  petroleum  gas.  The  PRC \ntraditional corporate lending based on balance sheet is not up to the task of funding the required \ninvestment for natural gas distribution infrastructure in new areas, particularly IWT.  \n ", "6   \n23.  ADB\u2019s assistance is designed to lower transaction costs by bundling technical clusters \nalong long-distance transportation corridors, which are often too small and time-consuming for \ninternational banks to finance on a stand-alone basis. The local city commercial banks are less \nactive in servicing project companies outside the boundaries of the designated cities. ADB\u2019s \nvalue addition is to link the cluster of projects with the wider financing community, including \ninternational banks, by providing in-depth technical and safeguard due diligence.  \n \nC.  Risks \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n24.  Adoption risk. CNG and LNG vehicles are more expensive than conventional vehicles.  \nAlso, conversion of conventional engines on existing vehicles to allow for use of CNG and LNG \nrequires up-front investment by vehicle owners. These costs may create barriers to the adoption \nof CNG and LNG as a transportation fuel and result in a lack of demand for CNG and LNG. Due \ndiligence confirmed that the payback period for incremental costs associated with buying CNG \nand LNG vehicles and converting conventional engines to CNG and LNG is less than 2 years. \nFurthermore, ADB is supporting adaptation by enhancing access to finance.13 The technology \nassociated with the conversion of conventional engines to CNG and LNG is proven and has a \npositive track record. Adoption risk is also expected to be mitigated by government policies and \nincentives that aim to increase natural gas usage in the transportation sector.  \n \n25.  Market  risk.  Though  natural  gas  faces  competition  from  other  conventional  and \nalternative fuels, it is more cost-effective than conventional fuels such as oil and diesel, giving it \na distinct economic advantage. Regarding competition from other alternative fuel technologies, \nelectric vehicles are emerging but are limited to the large cities with high population density in \nthe PRC.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n26.  Regulatory risk. Natural gas for long-distance transportation involves new contractual \narrangements. Legal due diligence confirmed CGH\u2019s capacity to obtain all necessary approvals \nas well as the government\u2019s strong policy support for this emerging sector. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n27.  Completion and operation risk. CGH has a proven technical and management track \nrecord in construction, operation, and maintenance of natural gas distribution infrastructure, \nincluding CNG and LNG refilling stations servicing land transportation. The risk is also mitigated \nby the homogeneous nature of the subprojects, and the modularized and standardized nature of \nthe stations.  \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n \n28.  Foreign exchange risk. This risk arises from potential currency mismatches between \nthe borrower\u2019s foreign debt service obligation to ADB and local currency receipts of the project. \nThe dual currency feature of the ADB loan will allow the borrower to draw in local currency, \nthereby mitigating any foreign exchange risk. \n[CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED] \n  \n                                                \n13 ADB. 2013.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions  \n29.   In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environment. The potential adverse environmental impacts are site specific and \nmostly reversible. CGH\u2019s environmental and social management system (ESMS) will ensure \ndevelopment  of  quality  initial  environmental  examinations  with  environmental  management \nplans (EMPs), and implementation of the EMPs.  Initial environmental examinations will be \nprepared for all ADB subprojects. With regard to LNG station sites, only those which avoid any \nadverse impacts on biodiversity will be selected. The land transport CNG and LNG stations will \nhave no or negligible adverse impacts on biodiversity as they will be constructed adjacent to \nhighways.  For  climate  change  mitigation,  CGH  implements  boil-off  gas  compressors  in  its \nfacilities to recover any leaked natural gas and feeds into the cities\u2019 natural gas networks. \nPotential adverse impacts associated with construction will be minimized by the ESMS through \nEMP implementation. Potential adverse environmental impacts of gas refilling station operation \nare associated with accidents. A quality ESMS can minimize the accident risks. \n     \n30.  At this stage, ADB proceeds are not allocated for implementing specific subprojects. \nCGH commissioned qualified external experts to conduct a corporate audit of its current ESMS \nand  the  company\u2019s  past  and  current  performance  against  the  objectives,  principles,  and \nrequirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement. CGH will improve its ESMS to fully comply \nwith the Safeguard Policy Statement with regard to the project. The improved ESMS will include \n(i)  public  consultation  for  subproject  planning  and  implementation,  (ii)  a  project  screening \nsystem to avoid potential significant adverse environmental impacts, (iii) an initial environmental \nexamination  quality  assurance  system,  (iv)  EMP  implementation  arrangements  of  ADB \nsubproject  subsidiaries,  and  (v)  an  ESMS  implementation  reporting  system  from  the \nsubsidiaries to ADB through CGH. ADB will confirm the company\u2019s improved ESMS before the \nfirst disbursement of each tranche. \n \n31.  The project is classified category B for involuntary resettlement and category C for \nindigenous  peoples.  CGH  has  been  developing  an  innovative  LNG  business  model  and \ntechnology for long-distance transportation. Refilling station locations can be flexibly selected \nand they are commonly sited along main roads. The construction of refilling stations will be \nmainly in medium-sized cities. Land acquisition is not expected to be significant and is normally \ncarried out by the local governments before awarding of the concession. CGH will follow its \nimproved ESMS prior to the disbursement for the first subproject of each tranche and recruit \ncapable staff and/or consultants to ensure that the ESMS is implemented. The ESMS will \ninclude resettlement policy principles and procedures to ensure that subprojects using ADB \nfunds are screened. If the subprojects entail physical and economic displacement, resettlement \nplans will be prepared following national laws of the PRC and in accordance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement requirement 2 on involuntary resettlement. The project will not  have any \nadverse impact on ethnic minorities. The potential environmental and social impacts of the \nproject  have  been  identified  and  effective  measures  to  avoid,  minimize,  mitigate,  and \ncompensate for the adverse impacts will be incorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. \nCGH has committed to enhance its institutional capacity to adequately manage the project\u2019s \nsocial and environmental impacts.   \n \n32.  Other social dimensions. The project is categorized as having no gender elements. \nCGH  upholds  gender  equality  and  provides  equal  employment  opportunities  for  men  and \nwomen during project design, construction, and operation. CGH complies strictly with the Law of ", "8   \nPRC on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women. Jobs to be created by the project will \nbe offered to the local labor force regardless of gender, and priority will be given to women \nwhere interest is high, such as in the financial and human resource offices. CGH will comply \nwith ADB\u2019s Social Protection Strategy and report regularly to ADB on its compliance (including \nthat of contractors) with national labor laws and adherence to internationally recognized core \nlabor standards.14 Information disclosure and consultations with affected people, as applicable, \nwill be conducted in accordance with ADB requirements. \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n33.  CGH was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating to \ncombating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.  Investment Limitations \n34.  The proposed direct loan is within the medium-term, country, industry, group, and single-\nproject exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n35.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (the \nCharter),15 the government\u2019s no objection to the proposed assistance will be obtained. ADB will \nenter into suitable finance documentation, in form and substance satisfactory to ADB, following \napproval of the proposed assistance by the Board of Directors. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n36.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan facility would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the dollar\u2013yuan \nloan facility of up to $450,000,000 equivalent to China Gas Holdings Limited for the Natural Gas \nfor Land and River Transportation Project in the People\u2019s Republic of China, comprising \n \n(i)  a  dollar\u2013yuan  A-loan  of  up  to  $150,000,000  equivalent from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary \ncapital resources; and \n(ii)  a dollar\u2013yuan complementary loan of up to $300,000,000 equivalent to be funded \nby participating banks,  \n \nwith such terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this \nreport, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n11 November 2014  \n                                                \n14  ADB. 2003.
