INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Strengthening \nCapacity  for  Implementing  the  New  Energy  City  Program  in  Gansu  Province  was \nconceptualized during a workshop in Yunnan Province in September 2012 to discuss the New \nEnergy  City  Program,  which  was recently  launched  by  the  National  Energy  Administration \n(NEA).1 The concept paper was approved on 6 November 2012. During the fact-finding mission \nin  November  2012,  an  understanding  was  reached  with  the  Government  of  the  People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) regarding the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  financing  arrangements,  and  outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  During  the  period  of  its  Eleventh  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010),  the  PRC  rapidly \ndeveloped large-scale renewable energy capacity, and increased the non-fossil fuel share of its \noverall energy mix to 8.3%.3 However, an overemphasis on large, grid-connected renewable \nenergy sources undermined the wider deployment and use of distributed renewable energy, \nespecially in cities, in close proximity to the population. As a result, the share of non-fossil fuels \nin the overall energy mix of cities in the PRC remains lower than the national average. This \ndiscrepancy  is  particularly  pronounced  in  smaller  second-tier  cities,  where  the  share  of \nrenewable energy in their energy mix is often lower than the national average. Cities are major \ncontributors to carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions due to highly concentrated populations, energy-\n2\nintensive industries, and use of large coal-fired power plant(s) to meet the power and heat \ndemand of their residents. Thus, it is crucial to deploy distributed renewable energy in cities to \nmitigate emissions, and thereby reduce the environmental impact associated with meeting their \nenergy needs.4 Energy-related emission reduction programs for cities are of vital importance for \nthe  PRC\u2019s  climate  change  mitigation  strategy,  and  need  to  be  reinforced  to  attain  the \ngovernment\u2019s goal of reducing the PRC\u2019s carbon intensity by 40%\u201345% by 2020, compared with \n2005.5  \n \n3.  Over the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015) period, the government intends to add \nsignificant renewable energy capacity to achieve a more diversified energy mix. By 2015, the \nshare of renewable energy is expected to reach more than 9.5% of the overall energy mix.6 The \ngovernment plans to encourage distributed energy applications in 100 demonstration cities to (i) \nreplace large coal-fired power plants in urban areas; (ii) overcome the increasing difficulty of \nintegrating large-scale, intermittent renewable power into the power grid;7 and (iii) stimulate \ngreen growth and expand job opportunities.  \n                                                 \n1  The  program  aims  to  demonstrate  (i)  distributed,  new  energy  technologies,  including  solar,  wind,  shallow-\ngeothermal, and biomass power; and (ii) the concept of \u201csmart cities\u201d, which make intensive use of information \ntechnologies to maximize the use and facilitate the integration of renewable energy in the local electricity grid, in \nbuildings and to ensure a smooth rollout of electrical vehicles in selected second-tier cities. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 November 2012. \n3  This share also includes nuclear power. Between 2006 and 2010, the PRC added about 42 gigawatts of wind \npower and 3 gigawatts of solar power to the transmission grid system. \n4  The PRC\u2019s top 100 cities, for instance, occupy only 3% of the land surface, but are home to more than 17% of the \nPRC\u2019s population; contribute more than 50% of the national gross domestic product; consume more than 50% of \nthe total energy; and contribute proportionately to the PRC\u2019s overall CO  emissions. \n2\n5  Carbon intensity refers to the amount of carbon emitted per unit of gross domestic product. \n6  China National Energy Administration and China National Renewable Energy Center. 2012. Key Information at a \nGlance: China 12th Five-Year Plan for Renewable Energy Development. Beijing. \n7  Based on various reports 25% to 30% of the installed large wind power capacity is not connected to the grid.  \n ", "2  \n \n4.  The concept of rolling out distributed renewable energy in cities has been successfully \nimplemented  in  Europe.  In  the  European  Union,  local  authorities  play  a  key  role  in  the \nachievement of the European Union\u2019s energy and climate objectives. The Covenant of Mayors \nis a European initiative by which towns, cities, and regions voluntarily commit to reducing their \nCO  emissions beyond a mandatory 20% target. This is achieved through the implementation of \n2\nsustainable energy action plans, which are elaborated by participating cities and that summarize \nthe cities\u2019 planned local actions and policy measures to increase energy efficiency and increase \nthe share of renewable energy sources.8 By the end of 2011, 759 cities\u2014ranging from small \ntowns to large metropolitan agglomerations\u2014submitted their sustainable energy action plans.9 \nOne key lesson from this experience is that each city will need to adapt its planned actions and \npolicy measures to the specific local socioeconomic environment, and in particular to energy \ndemand and supply characteristics.  \n \n5.  Encouraged by the success of the European Union program (para. 4), on 25 May 2012 \nNEA announced the program to stimulate distributed renewable energy development across \n100 second-tier cities under the 12th plan. The announcement includes relevant guidelines \ndefining (i) ambitious targets for distributed energy, (ii) criteria for selecting the demonstration \ncities,  and  (iii)  implementation  procedures  for  the  program.  The  program  is  targeting  a \nrepresentative set of second-tier cities with varying economic structures, load characteristics \nand  renewable  energy  resource  endowments.  It  is  intended  that  by  2015,  each  selected \ndemonstration city will have (i) doubled the share of renewable energy in its overall energy mix, \nand (ii) attained a minimum threshold level of obtaining 6% of its energy from renewable \nsources. Furthermore, by 2015, each demonstration city shall install (i) solar thermal plants \ncovering an area of at least 1 square kilometer; (ii) 20 megawatts (MW) of solar photovoltaic \npanels; (iii) distributed wind power (at least 100 MW); and (iv) shallow-geothermal installations \nand heat pumps covering an area of 3 square kilometers, with biomass utilization reaching 0.1 \nmillion tons of coal equivalent per year.10 \n \n6.  In  September  2012,  NEA  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  organized  a \nworkshop targeting all provinces in the PRC to present, elucidate, and discuss the program. \nDuring the workshop, Gansu Province showed strong interest in the timely implementation of \nthe program in its selected cities of Dunhuang and Wuwei, but highlighted capacity gaps in \nimplementing  the  program.  NEA  requested  ADB\u2019s  urgent  help  to  prioritize  Gansu  and  its \nselected cities in addressing capacity issues in the implementation of the program.11  \n \n7.  Gansu Province is located in the central-west region of the PRC. The province ranks \n27th among the PRC\u2019s provinces and provincial-level administrative units in terms of per capita \ngross  domestic  product  and  relies  on  tourism  and  industries  for  its  economic  growth.12 \nDunhuang city, as a world cultural heritage site, and Wuwei city, with its long-standing history, \nare at the heart of the province\u2018s tourism development strategy. Wuwei city\u2019s central location \nalso makes it an important business and transportation hub; many major railroads and national \nhighways pass through Wuwei. While tourism infrastructure has been built up since the early \n                                                 \n8  See: http://www.eumayors.eu/about/covenant-of-mayors_en.html (accessed 02 November 2012). \n9  REN21. 2012.

See: http://219.235.129.58/ \n(accessed on 29 October 2012). \n ", "  3\n1990s, the greening of the cities\u2019 energy sector is important to improve local air quality and \nensure  its  attractiveness  to  tourists.  Both  Dunhuang  and  Wuwei  cities  are  endowed  with \nsignificant renewable energy resources, in particular rich solar resources characterized by (i) \nhigh solar irradiation, with more than 3,000 sunshine hours per year; (ii) a cool continental \nclimate with an annual average temperature of about 9 degrees Celsius; and (iii) broad, flat \nunpopulated areas adjacent to the urban agglomerations. These characteristics make the cities \nideal for both distributed as well as large-scale development of solar power generation.  \n \n8.  Dunhuang city has been at the forefront of demonstrating solar photovoltaic applications \nin urban areas. Under its city new energy development plan (CNEDP), Dunhuang city plans to \ndouble the share of renewables in its energy mix (to more than 27%) by 2015. CNEDP was \napproved by NEA, and Dunhuang was selected as the demonstration city under the program.13 \nDunhuang\u2019s plan involves investment of CNY26.8 billion by 2015, mainly on solar photovoltaic \nand  solar  thermal  installations,  micro-grid  establishment  to  connect  distributed  renewable \nenergy sources within the city, and support for infrastructure to facilitate the use of electric \nvehicles. Unlike Dunhuang, Wuwei\u2019s existing share of renewables in the energy mix was only \n3.25% in 2011, which it aims to increase to 8.38% by 2015. Wuwei\u2019s CNEDP was submitted to \nNEA in August 2012 and it was evaluated in October 2012 for formal inclusion in the program in \nDecember 2012. Wuwei\u2019s plan aims for investments of CNY837 million by 2015, for more than \n200,000 solar heating applications, and addition of 30 MW in solar photovoltaic capacity, 30 MW \nin biomass power, and 72 MW of small hydropower projects.  \n \n9.  Both  Dunhuang  and  Wuwei  municipal  governments  face  multiple  technological, \ninstitutional,  administrative,  and  financial  challenges  in  scaling  up  investments  to  develop \ndistributed  renewable  energy  and  integrate  it  into  the  local  energy  supply  mix.  CNEDP \nimplementation will pose significant challenges as cities seek to (i) translate identified priority \nproject  concepts  into  financially  and  technologically  viable  projects;  (ii)  institute  effective \nplanning and implementation mechanisms to swiftly adjust the city\u2019s action and investment plan \nin  view  of  CNEDP  commitments;  (iii)  establish  appropriate  fiscal  and  financial  support \nmechanisms  to  facilitate  public,  private,  and  public\u2013private  investments;  (iv)  systematically \ncollect, monitor, and verify data to effectively supervise plan implementation; (v) establish and \nmaintain  close  cooperation  between  municipal  government  departments  and  between  the \nadministration,  private  sector,  and  civil  society  throughout  plan  implementation;  and  (vi) \nsupplement the plan with policy actions and measures that enhance energy conservation and \nefficiency, thereby  reducing the additional renewable energy capacity required to achieve the \ntarget share of total energy consumption. \n \n10.  The capacity of relevant city government staff needs to be strengthened to effectively \novercome these challenges and ensure the timely CNEDP implementation in each city. To field \ntest the readiness of each city and applicability of the recommended implementation measures, \na pilot project will be implemented in both Dunhuang and Wuwei. The pilot projects will test \nsmall-scale, key priority projects in each city and thereby help demonstrate best practices in (i) \nproject  selection,  (ii)  technical  design,  (iii)  economic  and  financial  viability  appraisal,  (iv) \npermitting and agreement regarding fiscal support by the government, (v) procurement and \ninstallation  of  distributed  energy  applications,  and  (vi)  project  licensing  to  municipal \ngovernments and potential investors. The pilot project implementation will also help identify \nremaining barriers and bottlenecks. \n                                                 \n13 Dunhuang was the host city to the PRC\u2019s first large-scale solar photovoltaic project in 2008. It was subsequently \nselected as the demonstration city for renewable energy application by the State Council in June 2011. Dunhuang \ncity\u2019s success in reaching 15% renewable energy in its energy mix by 2011 led to its automatic adoption as one of \ntwo cities under the program (along with Dezhou in Shandong province) when it was announced in May 2012.   \n ", "4  \n \n11.  The TA is a timely response to the government\u2019s request for ADB\u2019s assistance with \nimplementation  of  the  program  in  the  PRC.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  NEA's  priorities  for \ndeveloping a comprehensive framework and establishing appropriate support mechanisms to \ndeploy distributed renewable energy applications. The TA will provide a best-practice model for \nplanning, appraising, and implementing distributed renewable energy development in second-\ntier cities of Gansu and other provinces. A successful demonstration in Dunhuang and Wuwei of \nhow  to  address  critical  capacity  barriers  to  effective  program  implementation  will  facilitate \nprogram replication. Lessons from this TA will be shared and discussed with NEA, and relevant \ncities, provinces, and other stakeholders.  \n \n12.  The TA concept fits very well with the government\u2019s priority of fostering green and low-\ncarbon development, and is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nthe  PRC  with  emphasis  on  promoting  resource  efficiency  and  environmentally  sustainable \ngrowth, and addressing climate change.14 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The impact of the TA will be the expanded renewable energy use in second-tier cities in \nGansu Province. The targets associated with this impact are (i) by the end of 2015, renewable \nenergy in Dunhuang city supplies 27% of final energy consumed, and in Wuwei city 8.38%; and \n(ii) at least three additional cities in Gansu Province commit to implement the program by 2016. \nThe outcome of the TA will be enhanced capacity of provincial and city governments in planning, \nimplementing, and monitoring the respective CNEDP. The associated target is that the priority \nprojects identified in the Dunhuang and Wuwei cities\u2019 CNEDP are launched by 2014.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA is expected to deliver the following outputs:  \n(i)  priority  projects  of  Dunhuang  and  Wuwei  cities  appraised  and  prepared  for \nimplementation, \n(ii)  capacity strengthened in planning and implementing the respective CNEDP, \n(iii)  pilot projects implemented for demonstration in both cities, and \n(iv)  best  practices  in  program  implementation  developed  and  disseminated  as  a \nknowledge product. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, studies, \nreports, data, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Gansu Provincial Finance Department will be the executing agency for the TA. The \nmunicipal  governments  of  Dunhuang  and  Wuwei  cities  will  each  establish  a  project \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2012.
