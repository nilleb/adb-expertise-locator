Justification \n1.  The  project  will  cover  improvement  of  traffic  safety  and  climate  resilience  for \napproximately 180 kilometer (km) of NH 1 in Ninh Thuan and Binh Thuan provinces.1 The \nprimary necessity for the PPTA is to assist the Government by providing a systematic and \ncoordinated approach to (i) identify critical subproject traffic safety \u201cblack spots\u201d and segments \nwith high climate change risks; (ii) engineer solutions, and provide a set of detailed design \nguidelines  to  remedy  the  problems;  (iii)  develop  capacity  enhancement  and  other  non-\ninfrastructure solutions; and (iv) prioritize subprojects for implementation under the project loan. \n \n2.  The infrastructure solutions are expected to encompass a wide range of relatively large, \nmid-size and a number of small civil works and equipment subprojects covering such items as (i) \nreplacing, upgrading and widening narrow unsafe bridges2; (ii) improving the safety and capacity \nof  at-grade  intersections;  (iii)  eliminating  dangerous  \u201cblack  spots\u201d  by  improving  roadway \ngeometry  and  facility  (crash  barriers,  crash  cushions,  bus  bays,  semi-automatic  traffic \nsurveillance and information system, etc.) and increasing driver\u2019s sight distances and visibility \n(e.g. light-emitting delineator); (iv) introducing improved slope protection measures in areas of \nland and rock slides; (v) raising/reconstructing of highway embankments and bridges along \nsections prone to dangerous flooding; (vi) increasing cross-drainage capacity; (vii) providing a \nseparated  motorcycle  lane  along  areas  of  high  traffic  density  with  a  history  of  accidents \ninvolving  motorcycles,  bicycles  and  pedestrians;  (viii)  providing  pedestrian  bridges,  traffic \nsignals, signage, pavement markings and similar improvements to increase traffic safety; and (ix) \nreconstruction of roadways and bridges along selected sections of the highway that are prone to \nsevere and repeated flooding. \n \n3.  Initial  investigations  by  the  Government  indicate  that  the  approximate  cost  of \nimplementing the improvements of the major traffic safety corrective measures and reducing \nroadway flooding is in excess of $200 million. This PPTA will refine these costs, establish \npriorities, and provide detailed engineering solutions for incorporation in the detailed designs to \nbe prepared by detailed design consultants. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n4.  The major outputs of the PPTA include a detailed feasibility study that prioritizes traffic \nsafety improvements and reduces roadway flooding and other climate change risks along one of \nthe most heavily traveled sections of NH1; capacity enhancement of relevant staff in the Traffic \nSafety Project Management Unit (TSPMU), Directorate of Roads for Viet Nam (DRVN), and \nProvincial Traffic Safety Committees in traffic safety and climate adaptation of coastal roads; \nand developing appropriate methodology and conducting seminars to assist in the design for a \ntraffic safety campaign to be carried out during loan implementation. Major activities include: (i) \nreview of current situations on traffic safety and climate change adaptation by the government \nand development partners including the International Road Assessment Programme (iRAP); (ii) \n                                                \n1  The project covers upgrading of critical unsafe and flooded sections under Loan 1272-VIE: Road Improvement \n(ADB1).  \n2 Under Loan 1272-VIE: Road Improvement (ADB1), the main roadway section and most of the longer bridge \nstructures were rehabilitated and upgraded, but a large number of bridges (mostly those less than 20 m in length) \nwere omitted from the project scope. Many of these shorter bridges have long ago outlived their design life and most \nhave a very limited vehicle load carrying capability. All are narrow, and they constitute one of the primary causes of \naccidents.

Cost Estimate and Proposed Financing Arrangement  \n6.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.67 million equivalent, of which $1.5 million equivalent will \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by \nADB. The Government will finance the remaining $ 0.17 million equivalent in kind.
