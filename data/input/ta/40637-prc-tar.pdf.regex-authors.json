During the November 2006 country program meeting, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to develop biomass power generation in rural areas.1 The concept paper was \napproved on 23 February 2007, and a reconnaissance mission was fielded from 11 to 17 March \n2007. The fact-finding mission occurred from 6 to 11 August 2007, during which an agreement \nwas  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, and financing plan. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Over the past two decades, PRC has achieved an impressive economic growth rate \naveraging over 9.5%. PRC now accounts for 15% of the global economy, up from 3% in 1980. \nIts economy is expected to double from its 2000 level by 2010 and to quadruple by 2020. Given \nthis projected growth, the demand for energy\u2014in particular electricity\u2014is expected to continue \nincreasing  rapidly.  Per  capita  electricity  consumption  has  risen  dramatically,  from  340  \nkilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1983 to 1,840 kWh in 2005. Currently, PRC has the second-largest \nenergy demand in the world and will have the largest by 2011. By 2030, it is estimated that PRC \nwill account for 20% of global energy demand.2 \n \n3.  Such  growth  in  power  generation  capacity  is  unprecedented.  In  PRC,  installed \ngeneration capacity has increased at an annual average of more than 8% over the past two \ndecades. Since 2000, the annual growth of electricity consumption has been about 13%. In \n2006 alone, 105 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity were installed, equivalent to the entire installed \ncapacity  in  Africa\u2014and  a  record  annual  increase  for  any  country.  The  rapid  addition  of \ngeneration capacity has still not fully met PRC\u2019s surging electricity demand; since 2002, more \nthan  half  the  provinces  had  to  curtail  power  supplies  during  summer  peak  periods.  PRC \nelectricity consumption increased from 259 terawatt-hours (TWh) in 1980 to 2,500 TWh in 2006 \nand is projected to increase to 7,230 TWh by 2030 (footnote 2). \n \n4.  Approximately  69%  of  PRC\u2019s  primary  energy  demand  and  82%  of  its  electricity  is \nderived from coal. The country has the third largest proven coal reserves in the world, and it is \nthe world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer, with coal production accounting for 38% of \nglobal production in 2005, which is projected to increase to 49% by 2030. Coal demand has \nincreased from 446 million tons of coal equivalent (mtce) in 1980 to 1,563 mtce in 2005 and is \nprojected to increase to 3,462 mtce by 2030. However, coal-fired power generation, using \nconventional  power  generation  technology,  results  in  considerable  environmental  issues.  It \naccounts for about 50% of the country\u2019s sulfur dioxide (SO ) emissions, 80% of nitrogen oxides \n2\n(NO ) emissions, and 26% of carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. Acid rain, caused primarily by \nx 2\nSO  and NO  falls on one third of the country and is estimated to cause $4 billion in crop \n2 x\ndamage and $900 million in material damage annually.3 Approximately 48% of cities fail to meet \nnational air quality standards,4 and PRC is projected to become the world\u2019s largest producer of \nthe greenhouse gas CO  in 2007. The country is currently responsible for 5.1% of global carbon \n2\nemissions, estimated to increase to 28% by 2030.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 February 2007. \n2  International Energy Agency. 2007.

Class II Ambient Air Quality Standards. \n ", "2   \n5.  Traditionally, PRC has been relatively self-sufficient in energy. However, rapid increase \nin internal demand has amplified reliance on imported energy, impacting energy security. The \ncountry is anticipated to become a net importer of coal in 2007, with imports increasing to 132 \nmtce by 2015, representing 10% of the world\u2019s coal trade. Declining domestic oil reserves will \nresult in surging imports, from 3.5 million barrels per day in 2006 to an estimated 13.1 million \nbarrels per day in 2030. Imported oil is projected to increase from 49% of primary oil demand in \n2005 to 65% in 2015, rising to 79% by 2030. PRC will become the world\u2019s second largest oil \nimporter around 2010, and by 2030 will import the equivalent amount of the 27 European Union \nmember states combined. PRC is currently relatively self-sufficient in natural gas; however by \n2015, it will import about 22% of its supply, which will rise to 54% by 2030 (footnote 2). \n \n6.  Biomass, mainly crop residue in rural areas, is an underutilized energy resource that is \nmostly  burned  in  the  fields,  causing  the  following  environmental  impacts:  (i)  significantly \nelevated air pollution, including CO , SO , and particulate matter, which impacts public health; \n2 2\n(ii) reduced visibility that affects air transportation; and (iii) reduced soil fertility. Alternatively, \nwhen  waste  crop  residue  is  stockpiled  and  allowed  to  decompose,  it  leads  to  increased \nmethane emissions, a potent greenhouse gas. In addition, development of biomass-fired power \nplants5 has several environmental and social benefits, including: (i) reduced air pollution when \nused as a substitute for coal-fired electricity, as biomass combustion results in almost no SO  and \n2\nlower particulate matter amounts; (ii) lowered air pollution by ceasing the burning of crop residue; \nand (iii) reduced water pollution, including nitrogen and phosphorous, from decomposing crop \nresidue, which can lead to eutrophication of waterways. Further, power is produced with no net \ngreenhouse gas emissions because the crops already absorbed the CO  during photosynthesis \n2\nprior to harvest. In the context of rural poverty, the conversion of crop residue to power will also \nhave significant poverty alleviation benefits as households will have an additional income stream.  \n \n7.  While biomass power generation is relatively mature in many developed countries and \nsome areas of Asia, it is relatively new to PRC. By 2006, only two straw-fired demonstration \npower plants had begun operation, but the biomass power generation sector is anticipated to \ngrow rapidly with a further 38 projects approved in 2006, with a combined capacity of 1.28 GW. \nHowever, there are several barriers to further its development, including (i) lack of provincial-\nlevel strategic resource optimization planning, (ii) limited availability of project financing due to \ndomestic banks\u2019 unfamiliarity with the sector\u2019s risks, (iii) lack of methodologies for resource \nassessment,  (iv)  logistics  issues  such  as  transportation  and  feedstock  storage,  and \n(v) fragmentation of the industry leading to poor coordination and repetition of mistakes. In 2005, \nthe State Grid Corporation of China established the National Bio Energy Company, Ltd. (NBE) \nto develop the biomass power generation sector in PRC. NBE, which also has a significant \nresearch and development program, is currently the largest developer of the sector in PRC \nthrough its demonstration project in Shandong. There is significant potential for the sector in \nseveral other provinces, such as the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, which has a high \navailability of biomass and relatively large farms, simplifying the procurement and logistics of \nfeedstock supply.  \n \n8.  Biomass  power  generation  promotion  is  closely  aligned  with  current  government \nstrategies. The Government identified renewable energy development as a strategic priority \nunder the 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP). The 11FYP specifically targets 5.5 GW of biomass \n                                                 \n5  Biomass power generation is defined as direct combustion of biomass in a dedicated boiler to produce steam that \nis then used for generating electricity/heat, i.e., hot water for heating homes and buildings. It does not include  \nco-firing of biomass in coal-fired power plants, municipal solid waste to energy plants, or installation of biomass \nfired boilers within an existing industrial facility for utilizing industry-specific waste. \n ", "  3\npower  generation  capacity  by  2010,  increasing  to  30  GW  by  2020.6 The  development  of \nrenewable energy sources, including biomass power generation, is also prioritized by the 2007 \nNational Climate Change Strategy, 2005 Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan, \nand 2007 11th Five-Year Plan for Energy Development. The 2007 Medium- and Long-Term \nDevelopment Plan for Renewable Energy targets 15% electricity generation from renewable \nenergy sources by 2020. The 2006 Renewable Energy Law was enacted to provide regulatory \nsupport  for  renewable  energy  development,  and  subsequent  regulations  have  allowed  a \npreferential tariff for biomass projects, e.g., an additional CNY0.25 per kWh over coal-based \npower. Additionally, biomass power generation utilizes waste, thereby directly supporting other \n11FYP  priorities  of  resource  conservation  and  waste  product  recycling.  Development  of \nindigenous power supplies also improves national energy security, and additional farm earnings \nfrom the sale of agricultural waste will also increase rural incomes.    \n \n9.  Support  for  biomass  power  generation  development  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  \nmedium-term strategy II for 2006\u20132008 and the PRC country strategy and program.7 ADB has \nbeen actively supporting bioenergy development in PRC, including Loan 1924-PRC: Efficient \nUtilization of Agricultural Wastes, which involved rural biomass resource utilization, and TA \n4810-PRC: Preparing National Strategy for Rural Biomass Renewable Energy Development. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be the improvement of environmental conditions in rural areas, \nand the outcome will be increased biomass power generation in the province of Heilongjiang.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will include the following activities: \n \n  1.   Biomass Power Generation in PRC: Barriers and Lessons Learned  \n \n12.  Component 1 will assess the barriers to and lessons learned during the implementation \nof initial pilot biomass power plants in PRC. The analysis will include assessment of relevant \nequipment technology, feedstock collection and transportation management, feedstock pricing \nstructures  and  levels,  financing  barriers,  and  environmental  and  social  implications  from \nbiomass  power  generation  projects.  The  lessons  learned  will  be  documented,  and \nrecommendations will be provided for overcoming barriers to project expansion. Where suitable, \ninternational experience will be incorporated. Provincial governments and project developers will \nuse the report in planning biomass power generation development. The report may also be \nsuitable for national policymakers. The report will be widely disseminated and publicly released \nin a series of workshops and a technical conference.  \n                                                 \n6  According to the 2007 Medium- and Long-Term Development Plan for Renewable Energy. \n7  ADB. 2006.

Provincial Biomass Power Generation Strategy  \n \n14.  Component 3 will prepare a biomass power generation strategy for the province of \nHeilongjiang to optimize biomass power utilization. Robust provincial-level planning will become \nincreasingly important as the biomass energy market develops in order to maximize resource \nutilization,  ensure  adequate  feedstock  availability  for  proposed  investments,  and  prevent \nunsustainable development. This component will include a biomass resource assessment for \nHeilongjiang, suitable for replication in other provinces, and preparation of a biomass power \ngeneration development strategy for Heilongjiang.  \n \n4.  Capacity Building and TA Output Dissemination \n \n15.  Component 4 will include capacity-building and dissemination activities, including (i) \nworkshops  for  financial  institutions  and  provincial  government  officials  to  increase  their \nawareness of biomass power generation benefits, and (ii) dissemination of TA outputs through \nrelevant channels, including a biomass power generation conference.  \n \n16.  The main deliverables from the TA will be (i) report analyzing the barriers to biomass \npower generation development and lessons learned from existing projects, (ii) two technical \nstudy  reports,  (iii)  provincial-level  biomass  survey,  (iv)  provincial-level  biomass  power \ngeneration  development  strategy,  (v)  dissemination  workshops  for  financial  institutions  and \nprovincial government officials, and (vi) biomass power generation conference.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000, of which $600,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency \nin Rural Areas to be administered by ADB. The Government will fund the remaining $200,000 \nby providing office accommodation, support facilities, and staff salaries. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over a 1-year period from January 2008 to January 2009. \nNBE will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the project and will also implement components 1, 2, \nand 4. The Implementing Agency (IA) for component 3 will be the Heilongjiang Provincial \nDevelopment and Reform Commission. Counterpart financing will be $100,000 from NBE and \n$100,000 from the Heilongjiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission. A steering \ncommittee will be formed to oversee TA implementation, and will include representatives from \nindustry and government. International and national consultants will be selected and engaged in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). The consultants\u2019 services will be provided through a consulting firm selected after the \nsubmission of simplified technical proposals and the use of quality- and cost-based selection \nmethods (quality/cost ratio: 80/20).  \n ", "  5\n \n19.
