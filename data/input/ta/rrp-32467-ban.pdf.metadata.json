The  area  has  been\ndevoid of significant externally financed development interventions\nfor  the  last  two  decades  due  to  a  20-year  insurgency,  which\nresulted in a general deterioration in the quality of life of the CHT\npopulation.  Basic socioeconomic indicators for the CHT reveal a\nregion  suffering  from  both  low  income  and  poverty,  especially\namong the rural population. The Project has been designed to\ncontribute to a reduction in the incidence of absolute poverty in the\nCHT  and  to  provide  a  confidence-building  environment  to\nunderpin the 1997 peace accord in which local communities will\nbe empowered to decide on their own development priorities and\nactively participate in the subsequent investments. The Project will\nincrease employment and income generating opportunities for the\npopulation, and result in a general improvement in the quality of\nlife of the target population.\nClassification Primary:  Poverty Reduction\nEnvironment  Category B\nAssessment An initial environmental examination was undertaken.\nRationale Rural poverty and lack of resources epitomize economic life in the\nCHT.  A  large  percentage  of  the  rural  community  consists  of\npeople  who  do  not  have  secure  rights  to  land  use,  clearly  a\ndisincentive to their investing in improved farming techniques and\nresource  management.  Additionally,  the  CHT\u2019s  infrastructure  is\npoor, markets are underdeveloped, and the institutional support\nsystem is not structured to address the needs of the rural poor\nand  landless.  The  Project  will  be  among  the  first  major\ndevelopment initiatives in the CHT for over two decades. It will\ncontribute to efforts to reduce the incidence of poverty among the\nrural population in the CHT through developing the basic physical\ninfrastructure  and  income-generating  opportunities  that  will  (i)\nsubstantially raise the standard of living of the landless and small\nmarginal farmers, and (ii) encourage women to become widely\ninvolved  in  community  decision-making  and  enterprise\ndevelopment  in  the  rural  areas.  These  developments  will\nrecognize the unique and fragile physical environment and will\nincorporate  sound  sustainable  management  practices.  This\napproach is consistent with the Government\u2019s rural development\nstrategy.  It  also  directly  supports  the  emerging  collaboration\nbetween  the  Government  and  nongovernment  organizations", "iii\n(NGOs) in the provision of services, including microfinance, to the\nrural poor.\nObjectives\nand Scope The objective of the Project is to help reduce the incidence of\nabsolute poverty in the CHT. A supporting objective will be to\nprovide a confidence-building environment to underpin the peace\naccord. These objectives will be achieved through (i) increasing\nemployment  and  income-generating  opportunities  through\nimproved rural infrastructure; (ii) providing access to training and\nimproved on- and off-farm productive technology; (iii) increasing\nthe  availability  of  microfinance  services  to  expand  productive\nactivities; and (iv) strengthening the capacity of local government\ninstitutions, NGOs, and beneficiaries to plan and implement local\ndevelopment  activities,  thus  providing  a  sound  institutional\ncapability for further development initiatives. The Project scope\nincludes (i) upgrading basic rural infrastructure of feeder roads,\nrural  roads,  and  trails  (including  bridges  and  culverts);  (ii)  a\ncommunity  development  component  that  will  establish  a\ncommunity  investment  fund  in  each  subdistrict  to  provide\nmatching funds for small-scale activities at the village level; (iii)\nprovision  of  microfinance  to  enable  the  poor  to  improve  their\nincome  generation  capacity  through  development  of\nmicroenterprises; and (iv) project management support.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $60.3 million, inclusive\nof physical and price contingencies, taxes, and duties.

The  agencies  responsible  for\nimplementing  the  individual  components  are  (i)  the  Local\nGovernment  Engineering  Department  (LGED)  for  the  rural\ninfrastructure  component,  (ii)  the  three  hill  district  councils  for\ncommunity development activities, (iii) an apex institution through\nlocal NGOs for the microfinance component, and (iv) the project\nmanagement  unit  (PMU)  for  project  management.  A  national\nproject steering committee will be established to help resolve any\nnational policy and implementing constraints on the Project. A\nregional  coordinating committee will be established in the CHT to\noversee implementation and progress of the Project. Community\ndevelopment committees will be established to work with groups\nof villages under the community development component.\nExecuting Agency The Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs\nProcurement Civil works contracts for rural roads and ancillary infrastructure\nimprovement and community development will be awarded on the\nbasis of local competitive bidding procedures among prequalified\nlocal  contractors  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for\nProcurement  and  other  government  procedures  acceptable  to\nADB.  Organized  community  groups\u2019  representatives  will\nparticipate  through  the  community  development  committees  in\nselecting contractors and procurement of materials. Vehicles and\nequipment will be procured through direct purchase for packages\nnot exceeding $100,000 and the rest will be procured through\ninternational shopping.\nConsulting\nServices ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of\nconsultants and the procurement of equipment and vehicles to\nfacilitate  the  timely  implementation  of  the  Project.  The\nGovernment  has  been  informed  that  the  approval  of  advance\naction does not commit ADB to approve or finance the Project,\nand does not include retroactive financing. The Government has\nrequested, and ADB agreed, that ADB will assist the Government\nto carry out the advance action for the recruitment of consultants.\nA total of 112 person-months of international and 232 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting inputs will be required under the\nProject  to  support  project  implementation.  NGOs  will  be\ncontracted for community mobilization, skills training, and capacity\nbuilding, and to provide microfinance services to village savings\nand credit organizations. NGOs will be engaged by the PMU on a\ndirect contractual basis.", "v\nEstimated Project\nCompletion Date 31 March 2008\nProject Benefits\nand Beneficiaries The Project\u2019s target population is the rural poor of the CHT. The\nProject  is  expected  to  provide  direct  benefits  to  about  52,000\nhouseholds comprising about 338,000 people through increases\nin  incremental  household  incomes  due  to  improved  rural\ninfrastructure, use of improved technology for on- and off-farm\nproductive  activities,  and  employment  in  public  works.  A  wide\narray of nonquantifiable benefits will also result from the Project.\nSuccessful implementation of the Project will benefit the target\npopulation  through  their  acquisition  of  new  or  improved  skills;\nincreased earning opportunities and incomes; better community\norganization;  and  greater  access  to  productive  assets,\ninfrastructure, and economic and social services.  They also will\nbenefit more broadly from improvements in the abilities of local\ngovernment bodies to deliver services in response to demand.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development\nProject.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. The proposed Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project (the Project) is included\nin the 2000 country assistance plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Bangladesh.  In\nresponse to a request from the Government of Bangladesh, ADB provided technical assistance\n(TA) to prepare a rural development project to contribute to reducing poverty in the Chittagong\nHill Tracts (CHT).1  Work under the TA began in September 1999.  A final report was submitted\nin April 2000.  ADB is streamlining its business processes, and this year is conducting a trial run\nby processing two agriculture loans in Bangladesh, including the Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural\nDevelopment Project. In keeping with the new business processes, no fact-finding mission was\nprogrammed for the proposed Project. A loan appraisal mission was conducted during 2-14 July\n2000.2 Extensive consultation between the consultants, stakeholders in Bangladesh, and ADB\nhave taken place during the preparation of the Project to ensure that key issues will be properly\naddressed.  Identification  of  project  components  was  based  on  (i)  a  benchmark  and\nsocioeconomic survey carried out under the TA; (ii) a series of participatory rural appraisals; and\n(iii) discussions with target communities, local government bodies, and other stakeholders,\nincluding nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Subsequent ADB project processing missions\nvisited the proposed project area and undertook extensive consultations with local institutions,\nstakeholders, and beneficiaries. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII. BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  The Chittagong Hill Tracts\n3. The  CHT  is  a  unique  geographical  and  cultural  section  of  Bangladesh.3  It  covers\napproximately 13,300 square kilometers (km2), about 8 percent of Bangladesh\u2019s total area, and\nsupports under 1 percent of the national population. The CHT consists of three districts\u2014\nBandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati\u2014and unlike most of Bangladesh, is dominated by\nsteep hills and narrow valleys, many of which are remote and difficult to access. The region\u2019s\npopulation is made up of tribal peoples from 13 distinct groupings, and Bengalis\u2014most of who\nhave recently settled from the adjoining plains' districts. The population of the CHT is estimated\nto be about 1.2 million, resulting in a population density ranging from 60 people per km2 in\nBandarban  District  to  147  per  km2  in  Khagrachari  District.  The  ratio  of  tribal  to  nontribal\npopulation is 51:49, with the Chakma, Marma, and Tripura accounting for approximately 88\n                                                \n1  TA 3213-BAN: Chittagong Hill Tracts Rural Development Project, for $500,000, approved on 30 June 1999.\n2 The mission consisted of Donneth Walton, Rural Development Specialist-Mission Leader; Dimyati Nangju, Lead\nAgronomist; Clare Wee, Senior Counsel; and John Graham, Staff Consultant-Economist.\n3  Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita income of approximately $373\n(Tk19,023). The country is a predominantly low-lying, flat, alluvial flood plain with some hilly area in the northeast\npart of the country and in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. The population was about 129 million in 1999, and although\npopulation growth has declined in recent years it is still high at 1.7 percent per annum. With about 885 persons\nper square kilometer, Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.", "2\npercent of the tribal population. Two major events in the last 40 years\u2014the construction of Lake\nKaptai and the insurgency war\u2014have had a profound impact on the lives of the CHT peoples.\n4. In 1960 a hydroelectric dam was constructed at Kaptai village within Rangamati District,\ninundating about 20,000 hectares (ha) or 40 percent of the prime cultivable lands in the CHT. At\nthe time, the population of the CHT was estimated to be about 385,000 of which about 100,000\npeople, mainly from the Chakma, were displaced by the reservoir. Some attempts were made\nby the then East Pakistan government to monetarily compensate the affected people, but the\ndestruction of such a large area of the best agricultural land and the forced resettlement of the\ndisplaced people was to have a far reaching impact on the social and physical environment.\nAlthough  some  of  the  displaced  farmers  migrated  to  India,  where  they  became  stateless\nrefugees, many were forced to take up shifting cultivation on the hill slopes, where soils are of\nlow fertility. No accurate economic data is available that quantifies the loss of the productive\nagricultural area but it was significant and it changed the CHT from being self-sufficient in\ncereals to a food deficit area, a situation that remains. The hydroelectric project is not likely to\nhave been built today, given the present Government\u2019s concern with social and environmental\nissues; and it has created land occupancy and ownership problems that were aggravated by\nsubsequent settlement policies and law changes.\n5. The land resources of the CHT and their capability are vastly different from those in\nother  areas  of  Bangladesh.  Because  the  CHT\u2019s  limitations  were  not  recognized,  the\nGovernment  sponsored  in-migration  of  people  from  some  of  the  heavily  populated  plains\ndistricts during the late 1970s and early 1980s. About 250,000 in-migrants (Bengalis from\nneighboring  plains  districts)4  were  encouraged  to  settle  during  this  period  and  they  were\nprimarily located on land that was already occupied or claimed by the indigenous residents. As\npart of the settlement policy the migrants were provided with food rations, cattle, and land title\ndeeds. The pressures of these land policies and their associated ethnic confrontations further\naggravated an insurgency that spanned almost 20 years and finally ended with the signing of a\npeace  accord  in  December  1997.  The  economic  impact  of  the  insurgency  has  not  been\nquantified,  but  anecdotal  evidence  consistently  emphasizes  that  all  CHT  residents  were\neconomically  adversely  affected,  with  the  standard  of  living  of  the  population  steadily\ndeteriorating during the insurgency period.\n6. The lives of the people in the CHT have been little changed for the past two decades.\nThe insurgency resulted in a general deterioration of the rural infrastructure and the surveyed\ncommunities indicated that no new rural facilities, except some military access roads, were\ndeveloped. From the subdistrict level down, the communities estimate that less than 5 percent\nof their roads are paved and only a few are of durable construction. Roads and trails are in poor\ncondition or nonexistent; many trails and paths in the remote areas are unsuitable for carts.\nPeople in the remote areas of the CHT often take 1-2 days walking to and returning from a\nmarket.\n2. Rural Livelihood and Poverty in Bangladesh and the CHT\n7. Bangladesh is primarily a rural society with 80 percent of the population living in rural\nareas.  Agriculture  dominates  the  rural  economy.  It  contributes  about  23  percent  of  gross\ndomestic product (GDP)5 and provides about 60 percent of all employment. Crop production\n                                                \n4  Roy, Raja Debasish. 1997. The Population Transfer Program of the 1980s and the Land Rights of the Indigenous\nPeoples of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.\n5  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 1998.", "3\naccounts for about 52 percent of agricultural output, with livestock and fisheries accounting for\nabout 20 percent each and forestry about 8 percent. Land in the plains districts is planted mainly\nwith rice complemented by other food grains (wheat and millet), pulses, oilseeds, vegetables,\npotatoes, sugarcane, spices, and fruit. Jute is a principal cash crop. About 70 percent of the\ntotal area is cultivable and land is predominantly fertile. Cropping intensity is about 170 percent\nand no unsettled land is left to exploit. Agricultural production since 1996 has grown at almost 4\npercent per annum, reflecting the continuing adoption of improved varieties, better fertilizer use,\nand  the  further  development  of  minor  irrigation  practices.  Forests  and  fisheries  are  all\nintensively exploited. Other rural economic activities include agro-processing, small and cottage\nindustries, construction, and service enterprises.\n8. Poverty  is  widespread  in  the  country,  especially  in  the  rural  areas  (Appendix  2).\nAlthough in recent years poverty throughout Bangladesh has declined in both rural and urban\nareas, the incidence of poverty is still higher in rural areas than in urban areas. About 45\npercent of the rural population lives below the poverty line6 and about half of the poor are\nconsidered to be the hard-core poor. Rural poverty is characterized by extreme landlessness,\nover dependence on subsistence agriculture, underemployment due to underdevelopment of\nthe rural nonfarm sector, low savings, and poor access to credit and savings facilities. Women\nand ethnic minorities, in particular, are among the most disadvantaged groups in the country,\nand are especially so in the rural areas. Reducing their poverty remains a massive challenge for\nthe country.\n9. A review of basic socioeconomic indicators for the CHT reveals a region that suffers\nfrom both income and human poverty, especially among the rural population. On average, per\ncapita income is about 40 percent lower than the national average. The rural population has a\nliteracy rate lower than the national average and less access to education.  This is a result of\nthe limited income of the parents, poor access to schools, nonavailability of teachers, and the\nextensive involvement of children in household and income generating activities. Water supplies\nare of variable quality, is generally scarce, and people lack knowledge about what is safe water.\nContaminated water is a major threat to health. Distances from water supplies are commonly\nover 0.5 kilometer (km). Sanitation systems are poor and over 80 percent of the households use\nopen  latrines  or  open  spaces.  The  availability  of  health  services  is  variable.  Generally,\ngovernment hospitals and clinics are close to subdistrict headquarters, but 65 percent of the\nhouseholds  are  further  than  5  km  from  these  facilities.  Traditional  doctors  and  traditional\ntreatment of diseases are common in the remote areas. Communication and transport are\ngenerally reported as being difficult. Almost 90 percent of households have very difficult or no\naccess to vehicle transport. Family income and expenditure was similar in all ethnic groups.\nApproximately 80 percent of surveyed households earn less than Tk25,000 (about $500) per\nannum (an income equivalent to the Government\u2019s food poverty line). The main occupation of\nthe CHT\u2019s rural population is agriculture (including horticulture and livestock) on flat and mildly\nsloping land, and shifting cultivation on hilly land.  Additional sources of rural livelihood include\nagricultural labor, service, trade, and general business. Over 60 percent of the rural households\nare involved in agriculture and agricultural labor, and only a small number of households have a\nsecondary income. About 40 percent of all families do not own their homestead land and of\nthose who do own land, only 35 percent owned cultivatable cereal land.\n                                                \n6  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2000. Bangladesh Country Performance Indicators.  Manila: ADB.", "4\n10. A key indicator of poverty is food security. A recent study on livelihood security in CHT7\narrived at similar results. The study indicated that the population experiences moderate to\nsevere food shortages on a seasonal basis, with nearly 65 percent of households having\nsufficient quantities of food from their own production for less than six months per year. Among\nthe three CHT districts, Bandarban appears to be the most severely food insecure, with 75\npercent of households having food security for six months or less; the corresponding numbers\nfor  the  other  two  districts  are  61  percent  of  households  in  Rangamati  and  59  percent\nhouseholds in Khagrachari. Food shortages are often seasonal and reflect a dependence on\nagricultural cycles.\n11. The reasons for this extreme poverty are several. The CHT\u2019s lands are visually attractive\nbut they are not economically productive. While about 70 percent of the nation\u2019s soils are\ncultivatable and have few production limitations, only 6 percent of CHT land is cultivatable and\nits generally poor soils and steep contours severely limit production enterprise options. The\ncreation of Lake Kaptai in 1960 took about 20,000 ha of the area\u2019s best agricultural land and\npermanently left the CHT as a cereal deficit area (para. 4). In-migration of people (para. 5)\nexacerbated  the  pressures  on  the  remaining  agricultural  land.  The  insurgency  internally\ndisplaced many families who are still in the process of reestablishing themselves. Much of the\nhilly land that could offer income generation opportunities in social forestry, either is under the\nexclusive control of the Forest Department or is subject to forestry regulations that act as a\ndisincentive to private forestry investments. This situation has forced poor CHT households to\nadopt a range of coping strategies to address food insecurity, including borrowing from relatives\nor moneylenders at high rates of interest, reducing the number of meals or the amount of food\nconsumed, consuming wild foods during certain times of the year, substituting less nutritious\nfoods for consumption, selling livestock and other assets that are difficult for them to replace,\nand seeking alternative employment often on a low daily wage.\n3.  Land Use in CHT\n12. A  land-use  capability  survey  in  19668  designated  four  classes  of  land  in  the  CHT\naccording to productive capability, and assigned land areas to each of the classes.9 The survey\nresults indicated that the predominance of severely sloping land places limits on development\noptions available to land users. Only about 21 percent of the land can sustain agricultural\nproduction.  The vast majority of the land area\u201479 percent has slopes of over 40 degrees\u2014is,\nby international standards, unsuitable for sustained agricultural production.  Unlike the rest of\nthe country, the CHT will be unable to achieve cereal self-sufficiency and will likely remain a\nfood  deficit  area.  The  traditional  farming  systems  have  long  responded  to  these  land-use\nlimitations by evolving a mix of cropping alternatives, which include food, cash, and tree crops.\n13. Despite the resource limitations on expanding basic agriculture, there are considerable\nopportunities  for  developing  horticulture  and  rearing  livestock.  Farmers  in  the  CHT  have\ntraditionally grown a range of tree crops and have integrated these into their shifting cultivation\n                                                \n7 CARE Bangladesh.  2000.

Lake Kaptai and\nthe few main towns covered the remaining balance of land, approximately about 6 percent.", "5\npractice. Traditional shifting cultivation as practiced up to the 1960s was in mainly forested\nlands where a long resting phase was possible, allowing trees to grow before lands were\nreused. The original cycle began with clearing enough land for a year\u2019s food in small and\nnoncontiguous areas near water and on low slopes. At the beginning of the monsoon, a mix of\nseeds was planted in holes cut into the soil surface. Principal crops included hill rice, maize,\nmillet, sorghum, vegetables, melons, gourds, pumpkin, hill cotton, spices, and tobacco. Planting\nbegan in April on the first rains and harvest lasted from July to December to close a cycle. This\nwas essentially a sustainable system supported by trapping, gathering, and hunting in the upper\nslope forests where the forest trees had a spiritual value for the communities. This system\nprovided food and a surplus for barter. As population and land pressures mounted, the same\nareas of land have been intensively used for up to three years and the fallow periods have\nshortened considerably. Although the same annual subsistence crops remain in the system,\nlonger-term cash crops such as turmeric, ginger, papaya, banana, and pioneer forest trees have\nbeen introduced in the plantings.\n14. Since only small areas are available for cultivation, the more productive flat and lower\nsloping lands have been used for intensive cereal, fruit tree, and vegetable production, with a\nsteady development of existing crops and the introduction of new ones. These farming systems\nare very varied but usually include some flat land or in the beds of seasonal streams for cereal\nproduction. Farmers suggested that there is further scope for expanding fruit tree and vegetable\nproduction, if basic road communication can be improved. Better use of the available improved\ntechnology will follow if the extension outreach systems can be broadened through the use of\nlocal NGOs. Similarly, livestock production could be expanded. Despite the lack of cereals,\nhomestead-based poultry and small animal enterprises could be developed. Many of the small\nlivestock enterprise options could be run by women, activities that have had a major influence in\nthe empowerment of women in other areas of the country. Such activities have been initiated by\nNGOs, which have provided an integrated technical training, feed supply, credit, and market\nassistance package and it is important that the CHT take advantage of these production options\n(cid:1)\nwith a similar NGO involvement\n15. By far the largest natural resource in the CHT is forest, and about 325,000 ha (about 25\npercent  of  the  total  CHT  area)  is  exclusively  controlled  by  the  Forest  Department.  These\n\u201creserve forests\u201d have been managed according to a succession of forest management plans\nthat have set targets for timber extraction and reforestation. Their principal objectives have been\nto  (i)  replace  abnormal  and  less  productive  forest  with  more  commercially  valuable  and\nproductive species, (ii) manage the forests on the basis of sustained yield, (iii) keep sufficient\nforest cover in the watersheds to prevent denuding of the hills and the consequent erosion, and\n(iv) derive the highest possible financial return and ensure the maximum use of produce from\nthese forests. However, the welfare of the people living in and around the forest areas was\noverridden  by  the  commercial  aims  and  these  in  turn  have  led  to  unsustainable  forestry\npractices. Forest diversity and habitat have been sacrificed and unsustainable monocultural\npractices have resulted in serious pest and erosion problems. Most of the forest products have\nnot been sold through competitive commercial markets but rather have been supplied to state-\nowned industries where the feedstock is provided at uneconomic prices.10 The situation in\nunclassified forestland, which is theoretically the remainder of the land area not under Forest\nDepartment control, is unclear. However, considerable quantities of timber and bamboo are\nproduced from this area and it potentially offers the opportunity for individual landowners to\ndevelop small forest-based social forestry projects.\n                                                \n10  USAID. 1990.

The  governance  structure  of  the  CHT  districts  is  unique  in  Bangladesh.  A  special\nministry, the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MCHTA) has authority over the principal\nadministrative councils (regional and hill district councils ) and development agencies. Under the\npeace accord of 1997, the CHT Regional Council (CHTRC) was created to (i) coordinate all\ndevelopment activities under the direction of the hill district councils (HDCs), including overall\nsupervision and coordination of matters under the jurisdiction of the HDCs; (ii) coordinate and\nsupervise the local councils, including municipalities; (iii) coordinate and supervise the general\nadministration, law and order and matters related to the development of the three CHT districts;\nand (iv) provide direction in disaster management and relief programs, including coordination of\nNGO activities. The CHTRC was formally established through an act of 1998. However, the\nCHTRC has yet to be fully staffed and lacks the requisite finances to successfully meet its\nmandate.\n17. The HDCs were provided with special authorities under the act of 1998. Among other\npowers, the act provided the HDCs with administrative authority over the staff of many of the\nline ministries in their area. Among these transferred departments are agricultural extension,\nhealth,  family  planning,  primary  education,  cottage  industries,  cooperatives,  social  welfare,\nfisheries,  livestock,  and  the  tribal  cultural  institute.  This  arrangement  is  not  viewed  as\nsatisfactory  by  the  line  ministries  or  their  staff.  Although  nominally  in  control  of  these\ndepartments, the HDCs do not control the local development budgets of these departments and\nhave little or no influence on the design of programs or their execution. The HDCs\u2019 revenue and\ndevelopment allocations from the Government are meager and they are expected to meet the\ngreater proportion of their revenue budget from local taxes and income from market leases.\n18. The only level of elected rural local government is the union council, of which there are\n111 in the CHT. A union is a group of about 25-35 villages. The responsibilities of the union\ncouncil have been progressively increased to include revenue collection and maintenance of\nrural roads and small infrastructure projects. To improve coordination among union councils, the\nUpazila (subdistrict) Development Coordination Committee (UDCC) was created, with the union\ncouncil  chairpersons  as  voting  members  and  the  subdistrict  level  officials  of  the  central\ngovernment ministries as nonvoting members. While the union councils are democratically\nelected bodies, they have weaknesses, such as few permanent staff and very limited financial\nresources. The union councils have access to additional sources of revenue for infrastructure\nactivities through the annual Government Block Grant for Union and Subdistrict Development,\nchanneled through the HDCs. Lastly, the CHT has an important traditional governing structure\nadministered  through  three  circle  chiefs.  The  outreach  authority  of  the  chiefs  is  through\nheadmen and further down through karbaris, who are village-level traditional land administrators\nand land revenue officers that were recognized by the civil government. They still perform these\nfunctions, but their role in land allocation has been considerably lessened in the last 20 years.\nThese  traditional  leaders  still  resolve  social  problems  and  provide  a  valuable  and  trusted\nnonpolitical form of guidance for local communities.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n19. The Government\u2019s strategy for development of the rural sector is enunciated in a series\nof five-year plans. The current Fifth Five-Year Plan (the Plan), for fiscal year (FY) 1998-2002,\nidentified the following objectives for development of the rural sector: (i) poverty alleviation and\nimprovement in the quality of life for the rural poor through increasing their income generating\nand employment opportunities; (ii) empowerment of the rural poor through increasing their", "7\naccess  to  productive  resources;  (iii)  attainment  of  food  security;  (iv)  development  of  rural\ninfrastructure, including market outlets, for improved marketing of rural products within and\noutside the locality; (v) development of neglected areas including the CHT; (vi) closing of the\ngender gap by giving priority to women\u2019s education, training, and employment, and providing\nspecial support for education of girls; and (vii) putting in place of effective local government\ninstitutions with the responsibility for design, formulation, and implementation of local-level\ndevelopment programs and projects, with the active participation of the rural population.\n20. The strategy to achieve these objectives include (i) the provision of skills training for self-\nemployment  in  the  nonfarm  sector;  (ii)  formal  and  informal  group  formation  and  group\ndevelopment  for  cooperative  activities;  (iii)  resource  mobilization  through  individual/group\nsavings; (iv) creation of an enabling environment for sustainable microfinance; (v) general rural\ninfrastructure development including roads (and related bridges and culverts), small irrigation\nand  flood  control  related  infrastructure,  and  continued  support  for  the  rural  maintenance\nprogram aimed at the poorest of the poor; (vi) land reform; and (vii) strengthening of local\ngovernment institutions. The budget allocation in the current five-year plan for rural development\nis approximately Tk87 billion, more than five times the Tk16 billion provided in the previous five-\nyear plan. The majority of the budget (Tk56 billion) is allocated for infrastructure development. A\nmajor focus of the plan is local-level participatory planning and integration of the local-level\ndevelopment  programs/projects  with  those  at  the  national  level.  Capacity  building  of\nimplementing agencies is also emphasized, and local government is to be closely involved in\npoverty alleviation and rural development. The plan also envisages a partnership between the\npublic sector and NGOs, with the latter complementing development efforts of the former, and\nsupports  the  development  of  microfinance  through  government  and  nongovernment  credit\nagencies to increase income generating opportunities in the rural sector.\n21. The plan identified three regions in the country, including the CHT, for special attention\nwith  development  interventions  aimed  at,  among  other  things,  improving  the  region\u2019s\ninfrastructure and telecommunication facilities, facilitating horticultural development, increasing\nthe provision of safe drinking water, preventing further soil erosion, and expanding agricultural\nextension services. Ongoing efforts at reducing poverty in the CHT are limited to a group of\npublic expenditure programs associated with the development of rural infrastructure. These\nprograms (including Food-for-Work, Vulnerable Group Development, and Rural Maintenance)\nserve  both  transfer  payment  and  human  capital  accumulation  objectives.  Food-for-Work\nprovides  wheat  in  exchange  for  work  on  rural  infrastructure  projects,  Vulnerable  Group\nDevelopment  provides  food  grains  and  training  to  disadvantaged  women,  and  Rural\nMaintenance employs destitute women in labor intensive rural road maintenance.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n22. External agencies continue to provide substantial support to the Government\u2019s rural\ndevelopment efforts through a wide range of projects supporting agricultural development and\nincome and employment generation (Appendix 3). Since 1984, nearly $2.2 billion in external\nassistance has been provided for such projects with ADB and the World Bank being the major\nfunding sources. Since 1990, the Government and external agencies have financed a series of\ninvestment projects that directly target the rural poor, and 16 projects in this category are\nongoing,  valued  at  about  $400  million  in  this  category.  Many  of  these  projects  involve\ngovernment and NGOs, and are part of a growing trend in public-private sector partnerships.\n23. Similarly, investments in physical infrastructure have been substantial and the combined\nvalue of the ongoing externally financed rural infrastructure development projects since the", "8\nstrategy\u2019s inception in 1984 is about $900 million. Most of the rural infrastructure development\nprojects financed by external agencies are geographically based, and there is coordination,\nthrough the Government, of the various investments with the aim of achieving nationwide\ncoverage. In more recent projects, the Government and the external agencies have given\ngreater emphasis to key sector, policy, and institutional issues alongside the investments in\nphysical rural infrastructure. ADB has financed advisory TA for institutional capacity building in\nthe Local Government Engineering Department (LGED)11 through its Management Capability\nStrengthening Project (MANCAPS), which has an action plan and detailed recommendations to\nstrengthen LGED\u2019s management structure and capacity to reflect its existing and future range of\nresponsibilities.12  The  recommendations  are  being  implemented  with  coordinated  external\nfinancing support.\n24. Only limited externally-assisted programs have been undertaken in the CHT during the\nlast 20 years because of the insurgency. Among the first was the ADB-financed Chittagong Hill\nTracts Development Project,13 a traditional integrated rural development project, which began in\n1979 and consisted of seven major components.14  The Project covered one of the three CHT\ndistricts  (Khagrachi),  and  was  completed  in  1992.  The  two-phase  Integrated  Community\nDevelopment Program supported by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF) was initiated\nin 1980 and tested in two pilot projects over five years. Phase 1 of the main project was begun\nin 1985 and completed in 1995. This phase covered about 18,000 families in the three districts\nwith the main activities being preschool education, youth training, water supply installation,\ndistribution of seedlings and seeds, and microcredit.  A five-year second phase of the program,\nwhich began in 1996, aims at expanding education through the formal and nonformal systems,\npreventing waterborne diseases caused by fecal matter, and reducing malnutrition and mortality\nin mothers and children. The project has been notably successful in improving education at the\npreschool level and in improving the general health situation. However, its credit management\nperformance has been disappointing with recovery rates averaging between 10-15 percent,\nattributed to poor loan supervision procedures. World Food Programme (WFP) activities in the\nCHT have been principally supported by the Australian and Canadian governments. In addition\nto the Vulnerable Group Development and Food-for-Work schemes, WFP in 1998 began the\nExpanded Food Assistance Program to cope with the return of displaced persons to the CHT\nfollowing the peace accord.\nD. Lessons Learned\n25. A 1997 ADB study of completed, postevaluated projects in Bangladesh,15 as well as\nlessons  learned  from  several  ADB-financed  rural  development  projects  highlights  the\nimportance of (i) institutional strengthening to ensure institutional capacity of the executing\nagencies and regional/district entities and beneficiary groups; (ii) the need to ensure beneficiary\nparticipation as early as possible, in the design and implementation of the project, and in\noperations  and  maintenance  (O&M)  after  project  completion  as  well;  (iii)  effective  sector\n                                                \n11  TA 1809-BAN: Strengthening LGED's Management Capability, for $740,000, approved on 21 December 1992.\n1122 1995.

Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.", "9\nanalysis and project preparation prior to appraisal; (iv) a flexible project implementation system\nbased  on  a  process-oriented  approach  with  frequent,  focused,  and  proactive  supervisory\nmissions in the early stages of project implementation, particularly for multicomponent projects;\nand (v) the need for the project management team to be located within the project area, and\nmechanisms  for  regular  contact  with  beneficiaries  (extension  activities,  focal  farms,  and\ntraining). Situating the project management team in the project area affords it the opportunity to\nbetter understand beneficiary constraints and aspirations, and to adjust project components and\nimplementation arrangements as required.\n26. Lessons learned from the completion of the ADB-financed Rural Women Employment\nCreation Project16 indicate that where NGOs are used to provide services in a project a clear\nexit strategy should be defined so that the development of beneficiary organizations and the\ncapacity to replace NGO involvement is not stifled.  The results of the project also highlight the\nimportance of training for developing microenterprises and for expanding small and medium\nbusinesses.  Training schedules and duration should be carefully designed and adjusted to the\nabsorptive capacity of microentrepreneurs.  Long-term training programs involving multiple short\nbut frequent training events, and refresher training is more effective than a single long-term\nprogram.\n27. ADB\u2019s Rural Infrastructure Development Project,17 completed in 1997, found that people\nwithin the influence area of the improved infrastructure obtained easier access to agricultural\ninputs  at  reduced  prices,  increased  their  use  of  high  yielding  varieties,  enhanced  their\nagricultural production and had easier access to health and education facilities. Small-scale\nindustries and trading activities also increased.  Among lessons learned from this and other\nsimilar projects relevant to the proposed intervention are that (i) greater attention must be given\nto maintaining the improved infrastructure to sustain the flow of benefits; (ii) the role and\ncapacity of local government institutions in rural infrastructure planning, implementation, O&M,\nand financing should be strengthened; (iii) more participatory approaches should be adopted in\nrural infrastructure development projects to derive larger benefits; (iv) procurement of essential\nequipment, recruitment of consultants, and appointment of project staff should be advanced so\nthat project implementation will commence as soon as the loan becomes effective; and (v) high\ntechnical standards for infrastructure works should be assured by technical and management\ntraining of prequalified local contractors, strict supervision of works by LGED staff supported by\nconsultants, adequate laboratory facilities for quality control testing, and sufficient LGED staff\ncapacity at the field level.  A lesson from an earlier ADB-financed CHT Project (footnote 13) was\nthat the project design should take into account local patterns of social organization, religious\nbeliefs, and resource use of the indigenous population living in the project area and that the\ninvolvement of tribal leaders from village to district level is important for project implementation.\n28. Lessons learned from an ADB evaluation study18 indicated that a participatory planning\napproach  involving  stakeholders  and  facilitation  by  NGOs  would  improve  the  outcome  of\nagriculture and natural resource projects in Bangladesh. Thus, there is a need for ADB to\nsupport a more participatory approach for project preparatory TAs in the agriculture and natural\nresource sector.  A 1999 joint ADB and World Bank country portfolio review mission identified a\nnumber of implementation issues that could have relevance to the Project. These include: (i)\nfrequent transfers of project directors and other key staff, (ii) cumbersome procedures and lack\n                                                \n16  Loan 1067-BAN: Rural Women Employment Creation Project, for $8.0 million, approved on 13 December 1990.\n17  Loan 908-BAN: Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $99.8 million, approved on 13 October 1988.\n18  Operations Evaluation Office. 1998.

ADB\u2019s  new  country  operational  strategy  for  Bangladesh19  has  identified  poverty\nreduction as its overall strategic objective. This will be accomplished through (i) promoting faster\nprivate sector-led economic growth; (ii) creating better development opportunities for the poor\nby  assisting  the  Government  to  invest  in  and  encourage  community  and  private  sector\nparticipation in rural development including rural infrastructure and credit; (iii) improving human\ndevelopment by increasing the productivity of the poor including primary health and primary,\nsecondary, and nonformal education and through increasing equitable access of women to\nsocial services; (iv) improving and protecting the environment in all projects; and (v) raising and\nsustaining the growth of agricultural productivity, acknowledging the importance of (a) improving\nrural roads to provide all-weather access to production and market centers, and (b) developing\nmarket  infrastructure.  A  key  feature  of  this  strategy  is  an  emphasis  on  promoting  rural\ndevelopment, including rural roads, small irrigation projects, crop/agro business credit, and\nmicrofinance, which should have a direct impact on the poor and improve income distribution.\n30. The poverty reduction objective of ADB's operational strategy for Bangladesh was also\nemphasized in a recently signed partnership agreement on poverty reduction between ADB and\nthe Government.  The partnership agreement sets long-term and medium-term goals based on\nthe Government's vision and plans for poverty reduction\u2014both the income and nonincome\naspects.  It also guides ADB's medium-term operations to support the Government's medium-\nterm priorities through pro-poor growth, social development, and good governance. To make the\ngrowth more pro-poor, the strategy would be to adopt an area approach to target assistance to\nareas of high poverty concentration. The strategy identified measures to enable agricultural\ngrowth through rural infrastructure, community development, microfinance, and NGO/private\nsector participation in rural areas, among other things. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s\ncountry operational strategy and the partnership agreement in that it aims at reducing poverty in\none  of  the  poorest  areas  of  the  country  through  improving  rural  infrastructure,  community\ndevelopment, microfinance, and NGO participation in rural areas.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n1.  Land Tenure Security\n31. Land tenure issues have been at the root of the civil unrest that has affected the CHT\nover the last two decades and the peace accord proposed two specific measures to address the\nproblems: (i) a land commission was to be established to review and rule on all the disputed\ntitles, and (ii) a new and comprehensive land ownership survey was to be undertaken. Little or\nno progress has been made in either of these areas. During the benchmark survey and the\nparticipatory rural appraisals, all ethnic groups expressed concern over the land ownership\nissue.  There  was  a  general  comment  that  individual  enterprise  development  and  the\nsubsequent improvement in incomes would not gain momentum while land issues remained\nunresolved. Much of the disputed land is flat or of low contour and is able to support a full range\nof agricultural enterprises. The tribal community also sees the activities of the land commission\nand the land ownership survey as an important process in recognizing ownership in traditional\ntribal land areas and providing individuals with a secure title for enterprise development. Little\n                                                \n1199   ADB Country Operational Strategy for Bangladesh, August 1999.", "11\nprogress has been made toward establishing a fully-functioning land commission. A retired\njudge has been appointed by the Government to chair the commission. However, until a case\npending in the Supreme Court over rightful appointment to the commission of one of the tribal\nex-officio members is resolved, the commission will not be fully formed and cannot begin its\nactivities. The activities of the land commission are integrally linked to the undertaking of a fair\nand comprehensive land survey in the CHT in light of concern that the survey would be used to\nstrengthen  the  case  for  settlers  against  the  indigenous  population,  many  of  whom  have\ntraditionally never held paper evidence of title to land.\n32. ADB, through this Project and the CHT Region Development Plan20 TA currently under\nimplementation,  will  continue  to  encourage  the  Government  to  seek  ways  for  the  land\ncommission to be formed and become functional in a way that would be satisfactory to the\nCHT\u2019s population. The Project will also assist through providing legal literacy training to promote\nawareness among stakeholders (beneficiaries, traditional leaders, and local elected government\nofficials) of their legal rights and providing training and information to empower them to exercise\nthose rights. The goal of such training is to provide local communities with basic awareness of\nthe law and concept of rights.  The Project will use the strategies for the delivery of legal literacy\ndeveloped under ADB's TA 5856.21\n2.  Sustainability of Investments in Rural Infrastructure\n33. A critical policy issue in rural infrastructure development in Bangladesh is the need to\nensure sustainability of the benefits derived from the investments. In this regard, continuing\nassistance is required to encourage the Government and LGED to improve the system and\narrangements for maintenance. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government has focused on this\n(cid:2)\nissue through implementation of the following\n(i)  Action for Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure under the first Rural Infrastructure\nDevelopment Project (RIDP). \u2014 LGED prepared a plan for budgetary allocations\nrequired to maintain rural infrastructure improved under the first RIDP and has\nbeen providing sufficient funds for routine and periodic maintenance of feeder\nroads in accordance with the plan.\n(ii)  Institutional and Financial Action Plan for Maintenance of Rural Infrastructure. \u2014\nThis  plan  is  being  implemented  under  the  Second  RIDP22  to  increase  the\ncapacity of local governments for adequate maintenance of rural infrastructure.\nUnder  the  plan,  LGED  established  a  rural  infrastructure  maintenance  cell  in\nDecember 1992 and completed a comprehensive inventory of feeder roads and\nrural roads in May 1993.\n(iii)  Action Plan for Directions in Management Development of LGED. \u2014  This plan,\nwhich  aims  at  strengthening  the  management  capacity  of  LGED  in  rural\ndevelopment  activities  including  maintenance  of  rural  infrastructure,  was\nprepared under the MANCAPS TA (footnotes 11 and 12) and was adopted in\nMarch 1995 by a national workshop involving many external agencies. A number\nof the recommendations are being implemented through ongoing projects. The\n                                                \n20 TA 3328-BAN: CHT Region Development Plan, for $1.0 million, approved on 8 December 1999.\n21 TA 5856-REG: Legal Literacy for Supporting Governance, for $500,000, approved on 24 August 1999.\n22 Loan 1215-BAN: Second Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $83.4 million, approved on 21 December\n1992.", "12\nProject will carry out the remaining recommendations, including those related to\nresource mobilization at the local level.\n34. In FY1993 the Government, for the first time, allocated a specific budgetary line item to\nLGED for the maintenance of rural infrastructure for the whole country. The amount was Tk250\nmillion.  This  allocation  has  gradually  been  increased  and  totaled  Tk1  billion  in  FY1999.\nHowever, the Government funds need to be supplemented by resource mobilization at the local\ngovernment  level  and  the  financial  performance  of  the  union  councils  requires  substantial\nimprovement. Many of the roads to be upgraded under the Project will require a high level of\nmaintenance and in future will impose a significant increase in the annual road maintenance\ncosts for the area. The existing work programs alone are unlikely to be able to accommodate\nthis incremental cost beyond the life of the Project. ADB received Government assurance that\nthe  requisite  financial  allocations  will  be  made  to  LGED  through  the  Rural  Infrastructure\nMaintenance  Program  and  to  the  lower  tiers  of  the  local  government  structure  to  ensure\nadequate maintenance of the improved infrastructure. Upgraded rural infrastructure also will be\nmaintained through local labor contracting societies. In addition, local community groups and\nunion councils also will be responsible for subsequent maintenance of structures upgraded\nunder  the  Project.  The  beneficiaries  will  be  instrumental  in  the  selection,  design,  and\nimplementation  of  village  infrastructure  activities,  and  therefore  will  be  responsible  for\nmaintaining most of the village infrastructure provided under the Project.\n3.  Access to Forest Land for Social Forestry Activities\n35. Most  forestland  is  unclassified  but  offers  the  potential  for  social  forestry  activities\n(para. 15). Difficulties are being faced in these lands as permits to cut and transport forest\nproducts are required and issued by the Forest Department.23 The procedure to gain a permit is\nvery difficult to follow. Additionally, several Forest Department checkpoints on the major roads\nleading out of the CHT, which are ostensibly placed to intercept the illegal timber trade, act as a\ndisincentive to the development of agro-forestry. There are many options for participatory forest\nprojects involving joint ventures between the Forest Department and local communities, but the\nForest Department has been unwilling to accept this activity as part of an overall development\nstrategy. Forestry development opportunities that could be developed under the proposed loan\nwould be limited by the above constraints.  Satisfactory resolution of these issues will require a\nclear forestry policy, including clarification of land classification, and a review of the system of\npermit allocation with the aim of developing appropriate regulation for allocation of permits to\nindividuals and communities for forest exploitation. Under the Forestry Sector Project,24 the\nGovernment is making an effort to increase access of local communities to forestland for social\nforestry activities.  Parliament passed on 10 April 2000 the Forest Act Amendment 2000, which\nproposes  a  set  of  draft  rules  aimed  at  establishing  regulatory  framework  conducive  for\nimplementing social forestry activities in the country. The Government is currently undertaking\nstakeholder consultations to secure input on the draft rules. The Project will liaise with the\nForestry Sector Project to continue the dialogue with the Government on this issue.\n                                                \n23  The Forest Transit Rules of 1973 and the Forest Act of 1927 govern the issuance of permits.\n24  Loan 1486-BAN: Forestry Sector Project, for $50 million, approved on 21 November 1996.", "13\nIV. THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n36. For the 20 years prior to the 1997 peace accord, the CHT had been under a state of\ninsurgency, the rural infrastructure had substantially deteriorated, and the lives and livelihoods\nof the rural population had been severely disrupted. Despite the cessation of hostilities, little has\nchanged  for  the  region\u2019s  rural  population.  Rural  poverty  and  lack  of  resources  epitomize\neconomic life in the CHT. A large percentage of the farming community consists of people who\ndo not have secure rights to land use, but who work as tenant farmers, clearly a disincentive to\ntheir investing in improved farming techniques and resource management. These people suffer\nfrom seasonal food insecurity. Additionally, the weak institutional support system is unable to\naddress the needs of the rural poor, landless, and tribal population, and is still in the process of\nconsiderable change and reorganization.\n37. The Project will be the first major development initiative in the CHT since the peace\naccord.  The Project has been designed to upgrade the socioeconomic infrastructure in the CHT\nand to increase employment and income generating opportunities for the rural population. The\ndesign of the Project has taken into consideration (i) the impact of completed and ongoing\nprojects in Bangladesh, and the recommendations in the impact evaluation study including\nlessons learned (paras. 25-28); (ii) promotion of development that is sustainable in terms of the\nnatural environment and the capabilities of the target groups; (iii) the overall capacity of the\nexecuting and implementing agencies, and the need for clear lines of authority, delegation, and\ncoordination between concerned government agencies; (iv) the adequate provision for future\nO&M of upgraded facilities; (v) the fragile political environment in the CHT, and the complex\ninterrelationships between line agencies, the regional council and HDCs; (vi) the importance of\nconfidence building among beneficiaries, particularly among the tribal population (including\nreturnees from India), poor landless groups, and women; and (vii) appropriate structures for the\noverall management of the Project and expected contributions from beneficiaries.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n38. The primary objective of the Project is to reduce the incidence of absolute poverty\namong the rural population of the CHT through developing the basic physical infrastructure and\nexpanding income and employment-generating opportunities that will substantially raise the\nstandard  of  living  of  the  landless  and  small  marginal  farmers.  These  developments  will\nrecognize the unique and fragile physical environment and will incorporate sound sustainable\nmanagement practices. This approach is consistent with the thrust of the Government\u2019s rural\ndevelopment  strategy.  It  also  directly  supports  the  emerging  collaboration  between  the\nGovernment and the NGOs in the provision of services, including microfinance, to the rural\npoor. A supporting objective will be to provide a confidence-building environment to underpin\nthe peace accord in which all the ethnic groups in the local communities will be empowered to\ndecide  on  their  own  development  priorities  and  take  on  ownership  of  the  subsequent\ninvestments. These objectives will be achieved through initiatives in the following areas: (i)\ntechnology, to improve infrastructure and on- and off-farm productivity, and to facilitate village-\nlevel productive activities; (ii) organization, to improve local and institutional capacity to build,\nimplement, operate and support project activities, and to address structural and institutional\nconstraints; and (iii) sustainability, to (a) improve the levels of participation and inclusion of the\nintended beneficiaries, including women and the tribal population; (b) enhance food and income\nsecurity; and (c) build supportive economic mechanisms, and social and political institutions.", "14\n39. The project scope includes (i) upgrading of feeder roads, rural roads, trails, bridges, and\nculverts; (ii) a community development component that will establish a community investment\nfund to provide funds for small-scale activities at the village level; (iii) improved and increased\nproductivity  through  better  access  to  microfinance,  training,  and  other  support  services  to\nenable the poor to improve their income generating capacity; and (iv) project management\nsupport.  The  project  area  includes  the  three  CHT  districts:  Bandarban,  Khagrachari,  and\nRangamati.\n40. The target beneficiaries will be (i) poor shifting cultivators who are unable to meet their\nbasic consumption needs and whose main source of income is manual labor; (ii) poor landless\nfarmers  who  have  less  than  0.2  ha  of  cereal  production  land,  including  homesteads,  and\ndepend on manual labor as their main source of income; and (iii) the absolutely poor marginal\nfarmers with less than 0.45 ha of cereal production land. Data in the CHT on household caloric\nintake is generally inadequate. Target beneficiaries have a family income of less than Tk20,000\nper annum and are below the food poverty line in the Government\u2019s poverty index. The primary\nproject beneficiaries will be about 52,000 rural families, which is about 40 percent of the total\nrural farm families in the CHT. Given the opportunity, farmers and householders in the above\ncategories respond successfully to well focused agricultural, horticultural, and livestock and\nother credit schemes and technical services, and are able to cope with the new enterprise\nresponsibilities. A range of secondary target beneficiaries may include farmer groups, producer\nassociations, and small local entrepreneurs. In addition, the Project will provide institutional\nstrengthening  for  planning  and  implementing  agencies,  which  could  involve  public  sector\nentities,  union  councils,  NGOs,  and  village/community  management  groups.  The  physical\ntargets for the infrastructure and credit components are indicative given the demand-driven and\nconsultative process approach to implementation of the Project. Flexibility is required in the\nscheduling  and  achievement  of  the  implementation  targets.  In  practice,  achievements  will\ndepend on the demand from the communities.\n1.  Upgrading and Rehabilitation of Rural Infrastructure\n41. The  inadequate  road  and  trail  network  is  a  major  deficiency  in  the  CHT,  and\nimprovements are needed to connect the scattered rural communities with the existing growth\ncenters. The rural infrastructure component of the Project targets improvements for feeder\nroads  and  rural  roads  and  construction  of  bridges  and  culverts.  These  improvements  will\nincrease the access of remote communities to health and education facilities, lower the costs of\ntransport, and result in higher prices for agricultural outputs and lower costs of inputs.  Indicative\nrural infrastructure targets proposed under the Project include improvement of (i) up to 75 km of\nfeeder roads type B and up to 350 km of rural roads; (ii) construction of about 6,069 meters of\nbridges and culverts needed for these roads and to fill gaps in some existing roads; and (iii)\nprovision  of  vehicles,  large  machinery,  equipment  and  consulting  services  to  successfully\nimplement the component. With the exception of the municipal areas, road distribution funding\nhas been allocated on the basis of population. Construction priorities will be established through\na consultative process with the involved communities. Standard LGED designs, specifications,\nand implementation procedures will be used for the roads. Much of the work will be carried out\nusing labor intensive procedures through local labor contracting societies.\n42. LGED  has  identified  potential  rural  roads  for  improvement  under  the  Project.    The\nprioritization and final selection of rural roads will be done through further study of district", "15\nindicative development potential maps25 and district rural road inventory maps26 to be developed\nby LGED\u2019s Geographic Information System (GIS) Unit, and further discussions with target\ncommunities and union councils.  Site selection for small road structures (bridges, crossings\nand culverts) will be carried out during project implementation through local participation and will\nreflect local priorities. The following criteria will be applied in reviewing proposals for such\nstructures: (i) investment will be limited to spanning of gaps or replacement of badly damaged\nstructures; and (ii) investment should increase the connectivity of the rural road network by\nmaking lengths of road that connect rural areas into a higher level of network, or to an important\nplace, continuously passable by wheeled vehicles. These participatory procedures are familiar\nto  LGED  and  have  been  used  successfully  in  the  ongoing  ADB-financed  Third  Rural\nInfrastructure Development Project.27\n2. Community Development\n43. Community-specific  efforts  are  needed  to  fill  gaps  in  the  social  and  economic\ninfrastructure. Unlike their counterparts in the plains districts, communities in the CHT are\nusually small and scattered. They are characterized by the absence or poor state of basic\namenities  such  as  infrastructure  for  drinking  water,  drainage,  sanitation,  markets,  and\ncommunity  buildings.  The  Project  will  respond  to  the  needs  for  priority  small-scale\nsocioeconomic infrastructure to be identified and prioritized by the communities. A community\ninvestment fund (CIF) will be established and managed by the project management unit (PMU)\nat the regional level to provide block grants of approximately $70,000 to each union council area\nfor community development activities. The CIF will finance demand-driven, community-based\ninvestments  in  small-scale  civil  works  or  other  socioeconomic  infrastructure,  on  a  direct\npayment  basis  between  the  PMU  and  the  contractors.  Each  investment  could  be  for  an\nindividual village or for a group of villages.\n44. Examples of investments eligible for financing include (i) economic infrastructure such as\nmini-irrigation works, solar paneling, and small markets; and (ii) social infrastructure such as\nvillage  health  posts,  community  water/sanitation  schemes,  literacy  centers,  and  community\ncenters. Items that will not be eligible for financing under this component include purchase or\nleasing  of  land,  rehabilitation  or  construction  on  private  land,  completion  of  unfinished\nconstruction projects, and facilities that do not directly or indirectly increase the productivity of\nthe poor.\n45. A significant indicator of \u201cdemand\u201d under this component will be the extent to which\ncommunities are willing to contribute to investments and to the O&M of the completed project\nfacilities.  A community\u2019s contributions to an activity will be an important criterion for its eligibility\nfor funding. Contributions could include cash, labor, or beneficiary participation in planning,\nimplementation, and O&M. The communities are to base their level of contribution on what is\naffordable, with some flexibility to accommodate especially difficult circumstances. Investments\nmade from the CIFs will attract differing percentage contributions, but in general will be 10-25\npercent of a subproject cost. To facilitate this process, project staff, especially the community\ndevelopment organizers, will work with LGED and other service providers to produce a \u201cmenu\u201d\n                                                \n25  An indicative map indicates large settlements, areas of extensive agricultural/livestock production, forest areas,\nimportant  water  bodies  (rivers,  lakes,  ponds,  etc.),  existing  socioeconomic  infrastructure  (markets  for\nagricultural/livestock products, bazaars, administrative centers, health centers, schools, etc.), and any other\nrelevant existing and potential areas where economic and/or development activities are in progress or planned.\n26  A rural road inventory map indicates the existing network of rural roads and the link to higher-class road networks.\n27  Loan 1581-BAN: Third Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for $70.0 million, approved on 20 November\n1997.", "16\nof small-scale socioeconomic infrastructure investments.  LGED already has photographs and\ncost estimates of a range of such sample investments.  Development and use of the menu will\ngive communities ideas about what could be done and cost. The communities and union\ncouncils will be required, as far as possible, to contribute labor to the subproject and maintain it\nwhen completed.\n3. Microenterprise Development\n46. The  generation  of  additional  income  through  the  expansion  and/or  development  of\nmicroenterprises at the farm and household level can significantly reduce poverty among the\nProject\u2019s target beneficiaries. Despite its resource constraints, the CHT has opportunities for\ninvestments that can be practically implemented. Capital to access better agriculture inputs is\nneeded  to  enable  farmers  to  improve  their  farming  systems.  Capital  is  also  needed  for\ndiversification into other income generating activities to supplement the income from crops.\nSpecifically, this includes investment in fertilizer and improved seeds for staples and horticulture\ncrops  (fruit  trees  and  vegetables).  Capital  also  will  be  required  to  develop  small  private\nnurseries to provide seedlings required by farmers. Households will need credit to purchase\nsmall animals such as chickens, ducks, and goats, where appropriate, and to invest in other\nactivities such as fishponds and small-scale agro-processing. Households also will require credit\nto diversify and/or supplement their income sources through off-farm activities such as weaving,\ntailoring, small machinery maintenance facilities, bicycle/tricycle repair, and petty trading.\n47. Formal credit providers have a long history of involvement in the CHT. Their services,\nhowever, have not been targeted at the poor, predominantly rural population. Some NGOs have\nbeen providing very limited microfinance services to the CHT population since implementation\nof the 1997 peace accord, with limited success. Strong consideration will be given to using\nNGOs to establish savings and credit groups at the village level and to provide short- and\nmedium-term credit for a range of on-farm and off-farm enterprises, and supporting services for\nthe  target  population.  The  microenterprise  development  component  will  be  targeted  at\nhouseholds with annual incomes of less than Tk20,000, and will primarily focus on supplying\nservices to women, who are expected to make up at least 70 percent of project borrowers. To\nsupport the credit provision through the NGOs, the Project will fund a concurrent program to\ntrain potential borrowers in credit use awareness and skill development. Prior to obtaining\nfinancing under the Project, prospective borrowers must have taken part in the training program.\n4. Project Management Support\n48. A PMU will be established in Rangamati (para. 54) and one district project management\nunit (DPMU) each in Bandarban, Khagrachari, and Rangamati districts (para. 57). The PMU will\nbe responsible for the overall management of the Project, coordination of the work of the\nimplementing agencies, and carrying out of the Project\u2019s capacity building and training program.\nA team of international and domestically recruited consultants and locally contracted NGOs will\nsupport the PMU in these tasks. To facilitate the successful implementation of the Project,\nvehicles, office equipment, and furniture will be provided to the PMU and DPMUs. Training of\nthe project staff, CHTRC, HDCs, local NGOs, and project beneficiaries will also be provided as\npart of the capacity building activities under this project component. A small project liaison\noffice, to be headed by an assistant project director, will be established in Dhaka to facilitate\ncommunication  between  the  PMU  and  relevant  Dhaka-based  ministries  and  agencies  and\nfollow-up procurement and budget-related activities for the Project.", "17\nC. Cost Estimates\n49. Total project cost, inclusive of contingencies, taxes, and duties, is estimated at $60.3\nmillion equivalent, comprising a foreign exchange cost of about $11.0 million equivalent (18\npercent) and local currency cost of about $49.3 million equivalent (82 percent). No recurrent\ncosts, other than the annual operating costs for project management support, will be financed\nunder the Project. A summary of the cost estimates is in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are\nin Appendix 4.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Exchange Currencya Cost\nA.

Financing Plan\n50. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $30.0 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources to finance 50 percent of the total cost of the Project.  The loan will finance $8.3 million\nequivalent of the foreign exchange cost and $21.7 million equivalent in local currency costs.\nLoan proceeds will finance civil works associated with the rural infrastructure and community\ndevelopment components of the Project, procurement of vehicles and equipment and their\noperating costs, consulting services, beneficiary and NGO training, institutional strengthening\nand capacity building, and project management costs. The Danish International Development\nAgency (Danida) has agreed in principle to provide parallel grant financing of the costs of\nupgrading the rural infrastructure in Khagrachari District, in an amount not exceeding $15\nmillion.  The  Government  will  contribute  approximately  15  percent  of  total  project  costs,\namounting to nearly $9.1 million in local currency cost, while beneficiaries are expected to\ncontribute in cash or kind nearly 4 percent of project costs in the amount of $2.6 million. The", "18\nremainder of about $3.6 million will be met by the Palli Karma-Sahayak Foundation (PKSF)28 to\nfinance the credit line under the microenterprise development component of the Project. The\nproposed ADB loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years with an\ninterest charge of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum\nthereafter to be paid semiannually. The Borrower will be the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh.\nA summary of the proposed Project financing plan is provided in Table 2 and details are\nprovided in Appendix 4.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign   Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB          8.3 21.7 30.0 50.0\nDanida          2.7 12.3 15.0 25.0\nPKSF          0.0   3.6 3.6 6.0\nBeneficiaries          0.0   2.6 2.6 4.0\nGovernment          0.0   9.1 9.1 15.0\nTotal        11.0 49.3 60.3 100.0\n51. The provision of financing for local currency cost is considered justified under ADB\u2019s\nlocal currency financing policy. The Project includes upgrading of rural infrastructure, community\ndevelopment,  and  microenterprise  development,  which  have  high  proportions  of  local  cost\nitems. This is especially so for the upgrading of rural infrastructure which includes significant\namounts of labor-intensive construction work. In addition, because a low level of per capita\nincome and general fiscal difficulties constrains domestic savings, assistance is required to\nmeet  the  local  currency  cost  of  some  development  projects.  Since  the  early  1990s,  the\nGovernment has been carrying out a comprehensive program of structural reforms to liberalize\nthe foreign trade and exchange rate regimes, restructure the industrial sector, strengthen fiscal\nand  monetary  management,  and  encourage  private  sector  investment.  A  degree  of\nmacroeconomic  stability  has  been  achieved  and  maintained  by  conservative  economic\nmanagement. Nonetheless, the pace of reforms is slow, and macroeconomic stability remains\nfragile.  The  floods  in  1998,  the  most  severe  in  over  a  century,  significantly  damaged\ninfrastructure and agriculture lands, and negatively affected short-term economic growth by\nwidening fiscal and current account deficits and increasing the rate of inflation. Last, ADB has\nsigned a partnership agreement with the Government for poverty reduction. Since this Project is\nclassified as a poverty intervention, ADB should support all Government efforts in this area of\nactivity in a manner that is fiscally prudent. With these considerations and the overall lack of\ndomestic budgetary resources in the sector, ADB assistance for local currency expenditures\nrelated to the Project is considered justified.\nE. Executing Agency\n52. The  MCHTA  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  overall\ncoordination and management of the Project at the national level, including coordination with\n                                                \n28  PKSF is an apex financial institution that provides collateral-free funds at a nominal charge to organizations\n(primarily NGOs) for their microfinance program. PKSF\u2019s funding sources include the Government, bilateral and\nmultilateral agencies, and income from its own activities.", "19\nexternal funding and Government agencies; (ii) ensuring timely budgetary allocations to the\nPMU for the purposes of the Project; and (iii) ensuring the necessary national-level approvals\nare timely obtained for carrying out the Project.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management and Organization\n53. The CHTRC will be the lead Implementing Agency, and therefore will coordinate and\nsupervise overall project implementation, including overall supervision of activities carried out\nunder  the  Project  by  the  HDCs,  LGED,  participating  NGOs,  and  PMU.  The  Project\u2019s\nimplementing structure will be based in the CHT to help ensure the Project will be socially\nresponsive to the ethnic diversity of the project area. This proposal is consistent with the\nCHTRC\u2019s mandate, which was established under the peace accord and subsequently defined in\nthe  Regional  Council  Act  of  1998.  The  act  provides  for  the  CHTRC\u2019s  leadership  role  in\ncoordinating  community  development  activities  and  supervising  their  implementation.  The\nCHTRC has a clear mandate to provide direction for the work of all other local development\nagencies including those in the nongovernment sector.\na. The Project Management Unit\n54. To assist the CHTRC in implementation and management, a PMU will be established\ndirectly  under  the  CHTRC  in  Rangamati  to  undertake  the  overall  implementation  and\nmanagement of project activities. The main responsibilities of the PMU will be to (i) select the\nrelevant consultants and NGOs to participate in implementation of the project components; (ii)\nsupervise, monitor, and manage consultants and NGOs; (iii) implement, monitor, and review\nskill development and training activities; (iv) procure equipment and vehicles for the PMU,\nDPMUs, and the liaison office in Dhaka; (v) manage the relevant financial allocations; and (vi)\ncarry out the Project\u2019s reporting responsibilities. The PMU also will identify local policy issues to\nbe resolved by the regional coordinating committee, and identify any national policy and/or\nimplementation  issues  for  resolution  by  the  national  project  steering  committee  (NPSC)\n(paras. 65 and 66). While specifically formed to manage the proposed Project, the PMU has\nbeen structured to provide a project management entity for future development initiatives.\n55. A project director will be recruited under a competitive selection process to direct the\nPMU. The director will have a proven track record in successful project management and\nadministration, and will be fully knowledgeable and sensitive to the ethnic diversity in the project\narea. A senior administration officer and a senior accountant will support the project director in\nthe  day-to-day  management  of  the  Project.  A  monitoring  and  evaluation  officer  will  be\nresponsible for recording and assessing the Project\u2019s performance and its impact. Directly\nassisting  the  project  director  and  other  staff  will  be  a  team  of  international  and  national\nconsultants. The international and national consultants will operate under the direction of the\nproject director. The PMU\u2019s professional staff will be contracted for the duration of the Project,\nsubject  to  their  satisfactory  performance,  and  will  be  recruited  from  either  the  public  or,\npreferably, private sectors.\n56. Through its consulting support, the PMU will be responsible for planning the training of\ntrainers and beneficiary training subcomponents. For the training of trainers, suitable local\nconsulting firms or NGOs will be contracted to train the staff of local NGOs, participating\ngovernment  agencies,  traditional  leaders,  and  local  community  groups.  Under  the  PMU\u2019s\ndirection,  these  organizations,  agencies,  and  groups  will  train  beneficiaries  in  the  field.  A", "20\ndomestic consultant familiar with ADB procedures and systems will be recruited to provide\nproject and financial management support to the PMU during the first two years of project\nimplementation.  Additional systems training and support will be provided by staff of ADB\u2019s\nBangladesh Resident Mission.\n57. The project director will select staff for the three DPMUs and the project liaison office in\nDhaka. Each DPMU will be managed by a deputy project director, who will report to the project\ndirector on overall project-related activities for their district, and will also report to the district\ncouncil chairperson on activities under the community development component of the Project.\nThe  deputy  directors  will  have  a  comprehensive  knowledge  of  the  district  and  its  ethnic\nstructure, and will have good communication skills and a proven ability to work with government\nand nongovernment agencies. The assistant project director who will head the PMU liaison\noffice (para. 48) will (i) have the proven ability to work effectively with government agencies; and\n(ii) will be based primarily in Dhaka, but may be required to travel to Rangamati for extended\nperiods of time to assist the PMU as necessary.\n58. During project implementation, an interactive process will be followed with beneficiaries.\nParticular attention will be given to ensure that tribal and women beneficiaries are included in\nthe process. For such a process to be meaningful, the quantitative component of the proposed\nactivities should be regarded as indicative. Annual work plans will be developed based on\ndiscussion between the implementing agencies, project staff, and the communities, to establish\nlocal priorities and capture changes in community needs. These discussions are likely to lead to\ncomponent  targets  and  activities  being  changed,  and  may  result  in  a  need  to  reallocate\nresources within or between components. Project component performance and achievements\nalso will be reviewed with beneficiaries in workshops at the end of each year.\nb. Rural Infrastructure\n59. The Implementing Agency for the rural infrastructure component will be LGED, which\nhas established a reputation for the efficient implementation of road and other infrastructure\nprojects at the local community level. LGED has in place three fully equipped district offices, a\ncomprehensive permanent staffing structure in every CHT subdistrict, and is cognizant of the\nparticular local conditions in the project area.  However, to implement a project component of\nthis size, LGED will establish a specific project management cell headed by its own project\ndirector, designed to facilitate for project purposes, the use of LGED machinery and quality\ncontrol resources and to provide supporting engineering services.  LGED\u2019s project management\ncell will work in close cooperation with the PMU and DPMUs.\n60. Danida will finance the rural infrastructure component in Khagrachari District using the\nsame implementation arrangements as in the other districts.  The PMU will work closely with the\nDanida  implementation  team  to  ensure  that  the  agreed  targets  of  the  rural  infrastructure\ncomponent are achieved.  ADB and Danida will share knowledge, information, and lessons\nlearned during implementation, and conduct joint reviews.\n61. The indicative rural infrastructure targets reflect discussions between LGED subdistrict-\nlevel  staff  and  affected  communities.  However,  to  establish  a  priority  ranking  of  proposed\nactivities and to accommodate any changes of community needs, LGED will conduct meetings\nin all proposed work areas prior to finalizing each year\u2019s work plan. The meetings will involve all\naffected groups and a full record of attendees and minutes of the meetings will be kept by LGED\nand copies sent to the relevant DPMUs. PMU staff may attend and participate in the meetings.\nAdditionally, if requested by the CHTRC, LGED will permit a representative of the CHTRC to", "21\nattend and participate in the meetings. LGED will advise the PMU on the results of the meetings\nand their impact on the LGED work plan. Follow-up workshops will be conducted with the\nparticipating communities at the end of each year, where the following year\u2019s work plan will be\ndiscussed and finalized. The PMU and consultants will, if requested, provide assistance to\nLGED in this interactive process.\nc. Community Development\n62. The three HDCs will be the Implementing Agencies for the community development\ncomponent. Each HDC will be strengthened with a project office, and the HDCs will use their\nadministrative links at the subdistrict level through the subdistrict executive officer to assist in\nthe establishment of community development committees (CDCs). A CDC will be formed for\neach union council of the CHT. The CDC membership will be made up from the union councils,\nthe traditional and other leaders of local tribal groups, local elite including school teachers and\ndoctors, and local organizations and households. Community development staff from the PMU\nand DPMUs, with the subdistrict executive officer and local NGOs contracted under the Project,\nwill help form CDCs and ensure that they represent a full cross section of the local ethnic\npopulation.\n63. Local NGOs trained and engaged by the PMU under the Project will act as community\nfacilitators to provide information to communities about the Project and organize community\ngroups among target beneficiaries.  With the community facilitators\u2019 assistance, the groups will\nprepare subprojects to meet identified community development priorities. The CDCs will be\nresponsible for the selection of subprojects, their implementation, and arrangements for the\nsubsequent maintenance and management of the investments. The subprojects will be financed\nfrom the CIF. The PMU will manage the CIF and DPMUs will be responsible for validating\npayments for district subprojects. The payments will be executed by the PMU. Group formation,\nproposal formulation, community decision-making and management, representation of the local\nethnic population and women, and community contributions will be key aspects for monitoring\nand evaluation of the component\u2019s implementation.\nd. Microenterprise Development\n64. The thrust of the microenterprise development component of the Project will be on (i)\nbuilding the capacity of a select number of local NGOs to enable them to provide efficient and\ncost-effective  microfinance  services,  and  (ii)  generating  income  and  savings  opportunities\namong poor project beneficiaries. The main target population for these services will be poor\nrural women who are not being served by other sources of rural finance for asset creation\nthrough the provision of credit for funding small on- and off-farm enterprises and to facilitate\nsavings generation among the target population. Lending will be provided under two models: the\ngroup-based approach and through savings and credit organizations (SCOs). The group-based\napproach  is  effective  in  areas  near  to  roads  and  highways  and  has  been  successfully\nimplemented in the CHT. SCOs are an alternate approach under which SCO members are\ntrained to become responsible for the affairs of their organizations. This approach is popular in\nhilly and remote areas where the population is dispersed and/or accessibility is limited. PKSF\nhas agreed in principle to provide a line of credit from its small NGO window to local NGOs that\nmeet PKSF\u2019s criteria to become a partner organization.29 Based on an analysis of demand in\n                                                \n29  Borrowing from PKSF\u2019s Small NGO Window will be at a rate of 4.5-5.0 percent, with a repayment period of about\nthree years.", "22\nthe CHT, approximately 60,000 new members will be reached over the project period. Savings\ngeneration and other asset creation also will be important under the component.\n2.  Project Coordination\n65. A NPSC will be established in Dhaka by the Government to be chaired by the Minister,\nor his/her designee, of MCHTA, with members from the CHTRC and ministries of finance; local\ngovernment; rural development and cooperatives; LGED; agriculture, fisheries and livestock;\nwomen and children\u2019s affairs; environment and forests; and the planning commission, and will\ninclude a representative of the CHT circle chiefs, Danida, and the project director. The NPSC\nwill  provide  assistance  to  the  project  in  resolving  any  national  policy  and  implementing\nconstraints.  It  will  meet  semiannually  or  as  needed  and  minutes  of  each  meeting  will  be\nforwarded to ADB within two weeks of each meeting.\n66. A regional coordinating committee (RCC) will be established in Rangamati and chaired\nby the CHTRC chairman or his or her representative.  The RCC\u2019s membership will include the\nthree HDC chairmen, the project director, the three circle chiefs, LGED representatives, as well\nas representatives of NGO and other institutions participating in the Project, and Danida. The\nRCC  will  review  annual  work  plans,  oversee  overall  progress  of  the  Project,  resolve  any\ndisputes between districts on project activities, play a role in communicating information about\nproject activities and processes to stakeholders, and refer any major interagency problems to\nthe NPSC. The RCC will meet bimonthly during the first year of the Project and on a quarterly\nbasis thereafter.  RCC minutes will be forwarded to ADB within two weeks of each meeting.\nThe project organization chart is in Appendix 5.\n3. Project Implementation Schedule\n67. The project implementation period will be seven years, commencing in April 2001 and\nending in March 2008 (Appendix 6).  The first year activities will include (i) establishment of the\nProject\u2019s imprest account, (ii) a series of rapid appraisals to verify previously identified needs,\n(iii)  development  of  the  annual  work  plan  for  the  first  year  of  project  implementation,  (iv)\ncontracting of NGOs to be involved in service delivery, (v) preparation and possible launching of\na project public information program, (vi) procurement action for civil works contracts, (vii)\nprocurement of requisite equipment and vehicles, (viii) recruitment of consultants and remaining\nproject  staff,  and  (ix)  establishment  of  a  project  benefit  monitoring  and  evaluation  (BME)\nsystem.\n4. Operation and Maintenance\n68. The LGED will have overall responsibility for O&M of upgraded roads, bridges, and\nculverts financed under the Project and has given assurances that sufficient funds would be\nallocated to its Rural Infrastructure Maintenance Fund to cover maintenance costs.  The LGED\nhas assured ADB that, if available, additional resources will also be provided through the Rural\nMaintenance Program (supported by the World Food Programme), and disadvantaged/destitute\nwomen will be employed for O&M activities. O&M costs of small markets financed under the\ncommunity development component of the Project will be met by union councils using a fixed\nproportion of the proceeds of market stall leases specifically set aside for this purpose. O&M of\nproject facilities to be constructed under the community development component will be the\nresponsibility of the community, with financial support from local government.", "23\n5. Benefit Monitoring and Evaluation\n69. The Project outputs will be monitored and evaluated in terms of quality and quantity.\nBME will generate data on the immediate effects and the broader impacts of project investments\non  socioeconomic  development,  poverty  reduction,  and  the  empowerment  of  women.\nBenchmark data has been collected as part of project formulation, and the need for additional\nbenchmark data will be decided on at the first six-month review of project progress. BME will\ncomprise the following main elements:\n(i)  The  direct  effects  of  rural  infrastructure  improvement  will  be  monitored  to\nestimate  the  actual  economic  benefits  from  reductions  in  transport  charges,\nincreases in traffic flows, changes in transport modes, changes in turnover of\nbusinesses served by upgraded infrastructure, and changes in market lease\nvalues. The impact of road construction on induced agricultural production and\nother economic activities will be assessed. As part of the establishment of a\nplanned maintenance process, regular traffic counts (twice a year) will be carried\nout by LGED on all improved roads, while union councils will provide annual\nreturns on changes in market use and lease values.\n(ii)  The effects of the Project on poverty will be monitored through collection of time-\nseries  data  on  employment  created  and  the  characteristics  of  the  persons\nemployed, use of markets by poor women for trading, and increases in numbers\nof microenterprises in the vicinity of project investments. In addition, participatory\nrapid appraisals will be carried out at sample locations to assess the perceptions\nof different categories of poor people within the vicinity of project investments on\nwhether and how they have benefited.\n(iii)  The  effects  of  project  measures  to  increase  beneficiary  participation  and  to\nincrease institutional capability of local government bodies will be monitored. The\nproject framework defines the key indicators that will be used to monitor the\nperformance of the Project in achieving its objectives.\n6. Procurement of Goods and Services\n70. Goods and services will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines for Procurement\nunder Asian Development Bank Loans. The  civil  works  related  to  the  rural  infrastructure\ncomponent of the Project to be financed by ADB, including civil works for the improvement and\nupgrading of feeder roads type B and rural roads, will be procured in accordance with local\ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB.  Given the small and scattered nature of the\ncivil works, they are unlikely to attract international contractors.  In addition, the local capacity to\nundertake such works is adequate. Contractors for inclusion in a roster for the civil works will be\nprequalified by LGED at the start of the Project and updated regularly. Vehicles, machinery, and\noffice  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international  shopping  procedures\nbecause  the  amounts  involved  will  not  exceed  $500,000  for  each  package.  Equipment\npackages estimated to cost less than $100,000 equivalent, and for which there are several local\nsuppliers with satisfactory service facilities, may be procured under local competitive bidding\nprocedures. Where the number of suppliers is limited, procurement may be made by direct\npurchase.  Details  of  packages  for  procurement  will  be  determined  during  project\nimplementation.  An  indicative  list  of  equipment  and  vehicles  to  be  procured  is  set  out  in\nAppendix 7.  Civil works to be financed under the community development component will be", "24\ncarried out by local contractors identified and recruited by community development committees,\nwith  assistance  of  local  NGOs  and  project  staff.    These  civil  works  are  very  small,  and\ncommunity participation will increase the use of local abilities and materials, and contribute to\nthe sustainability of the Project.\n7. Consulting Services and Training\n71. A  total  of  112  person-months  of  international  and  232  person-months  of  domestic\nconsultants from suitably qualified consulting firms will be required for project implementation\n(Appendix 8).  International expertise will be required in rural development, engineering quality\ncontrol,  and  institutional  development.  Domestic  expertise  will  be  required  in  community\ndevelopment, specialty training, gender and development, communications development, legal\ncontracts  preparation,  BME  systems  development,  legal  literacy,  and  project  management\nsupport. Consultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants. The Project also will contract out services to local NGOs to help implement the\ncommunity development and microfinance project components.\n72. The Project is designed to support capacity building and skill development of local\ngovernment  and  NGOs,  CDCs  and  the  target  beneficiaries,  particularly  the  local  ethnic\npopulation and women.  The Project will fund an extensive program of skill development and\ntraining throughout the project period.  The training program will have two parts: training of\ntrainers and training of beneficiaries. Domestic consulting firms and/or NGOs will be expected to\nprovide this first tier of training, and the PMU together with the project\u2019s training specialist will\nidentify suitable agencies to participate in this activity. Local NGOs are likely to be the principal\nagencies  to  receive  this  type  of  training,  along  with  CDCs,  union  council  members,  and\ntraditional leaders. Training courses will be primarily undertaken in technical subjects most likely\nto help generate income for the target population.  Indicative technical courses include sloping\nagricultural  lands  technology  (SALT),  horticulture  development,  social  forestry,  fishpond\nproduction, livestock development, sericulture, agro-processing, and home craft production. A\nrange of supporting management courses will include, at a minimum project implementation and\nmanagement, business development and management, produce marketing and promotion, and\nenvironmental management. Training will be identified and provided to beneficiaries in the\ncommunity  and  village  areas  by  agencies  such  as  the  Bangladesh  Agricultural  Research\nInstitute (BARI) and the Department of Agriculture Extension. Courses will be designed to (i)\nenable beneficiaries to undertake successful income generating activities, and (ii) fit in with\nlivelihood commitments.  Graduates of the training of trainers\u2019 activity will undertake beneficiary\ntraining.\n73. Under the Project's training activities, NGOs and a select number of community leaders\nwill be trained to provide participatory training programs for local communities to be educated\nabout the law, government services, and legal processes.  The goal of such training is to\nprovide local communities with basic awareness of law and concept of rights.  The Project will\nuse the strategies for the delivery of legal literacy developed under ADB's TA 5856: Technical\nAssistance for Legal Literacy for Supporting Governance (footnote 21). An ADB project will be\nselected to pilot-test the strategies developed under TA 5856. If the Project is selected to pilot-\ntest  the  strategies  under  TA  5856,  the  Project  will  benefit  from  the  additional  inputs  of\nconsultants under TA 5856. In such case, the training in legal literacy under this Project will be\ncarried out in coordination with the activities under TA 5856.", "25\n8.  Advance Action\n74. ADB  has  approved  advance  action  for  the  recruitment  of  consultants  and  the\nprocurement of equipment and vehicles to facilitate the timely implementation of the Project.\nThe Government has been informed that the approval of advance action does not commit ADB\nto approve or finance the Project, and does not include retroactive financing.  The Government\nhas requested, and ADB agreed, that ADB will assist the Government to carry out the advance\naction for the recruitment of consultants.\n9. Reporting, Accounts, and Audits\n75. Progress monitoring will focus on the use of inputs; the participatory process, including\nthe participation of the local ethnic population and women; the progress of activities; and the\nachievement of outputs. The Project will be monitored through regular reporting and review. The\nPMU and DPMUs, in consultation with the Implementing Agencies, will produce annual work\nplans setting out the activities scheduled for the forthcoming year, their timing, the inputs\nrequired and the outputs expected to be achieved. The Implementing Agencies will provide the\nPMU with brief quarterly progress reports during each year of project implementation, detailing\nthe physical and financial progress of activities against the targets set in the work plans. In turn\nthe PMU, through the CHTRC, will furnish to the Government and ADB consolidated quarterly\nprogress reports and a comprehensive year end annual report including the progress of BME.\n76. During the first two years of the Project, ADB will carry out semiannual monitoring\nreviews.  Initial reviews will (i) determine whether all the proposed implementation arrangements\nare in place, (ii) assess the progress of physical works, (iii) critically review the arrangements\nfor, and results of, the beneficiary participation process, and (iv) review the outcome of the\ncapacity  building  and  training  programs.  Comprehensive  project  reviews  will  be  jointly\nundertaken by ADB, Danida, and the Government at the end of years 2 and 4 to evaluate the\nactual physical and financial progress of the Project, implementation procedures, procurement\nperformance, BME activities, PMU effectiveness, and performance of consultants.  Prior to the\ncomprehensive reviews, the PMU will prepare a comprehensive report identifying issues in\npreparation for the reviews. On the basis of the results of these comprehensive reviews, ADB,\nDanida, and the Government may consider changes in project design and implementation\narrangements.  Within three months of project completion, the PMU through the CHTRC will\nprepare a project completion report in the standard ADB format, for submission to ADB.\n77. The PMU will maintain separate ledgers, records, and accounts of expenditures and\nloan disbursements under the Project.  The PMU will install an accounting system consistent\nwith generally acceptable accounting principles acceptable to ADB. The project director will\nprepare an annual financial report on the Project\u2019s accounts and submit these to the MCHTA.\nThe accounts will be audited annually by an independent external auditor acceptable to ADB.\nThe imprest account and statement of expenditures (SOEs) procedure will be audited as part of\nthe regular audit of the Project\u2019s account and financial statements and audit opinion on the\nimprest account and SOEs will be set out separately. The audited project accounts will be\nforwarded to ADB not later than six months after the close of each fiscal year.\n10. Imprest Account and Statement of Expenditures Procedures\n78. To ensure effective project implementation and timely disbursement of the loan, the\nGovernment will establish an imprest account in dollars in the name of the Project at the\nBangladesh Bank or at a commercial bank acceptable to Bangladesh Bank and ADB. A second-", "26\ngeneration imprest account (SGIA) also will be established at a commercial bank in the CHT to\nreceive funds from the imprest account to meet project expenditures incurred by the PMU and\nDPMUs. The project director will manage the imprest account (Appendix 9). The initial amount\nto be deposited into the imprest account will not exceed the equivalent of $500,000 based on an\nestimate of expenditure in the first six months of project implementation. ADB\u2019s SOE procedure\nwill  be  used  to  reimburse  eligible  expenditures  and  to  liquidate  advances  provided  to  the\nImprest  Account.  The  SOE  procedure  will  be  applicable  to  contracts  not  exceeding  the\nequivalent of $100,000 and individual payments not exceeding the equivalent of $50,000 to\nconform to ADB\u2019s simplified procedure on procurement and disbursement. The imprest account\nwill be established and maintained in accordance with the Loan Disbursement Handbook dated\nJune 1996 and detailed arrangements between ADB and the Government.\nG. Environmental and Social Measures\n1. Environmental Measures\n79. The  Project  has  been  classified  in  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Category  B,  and  an  initial\nenvironmental examination (IEE) has been prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental\nAssessment Requirements and Environmental Review Procedures. The selection criteria under\neach  project  component  were  established,  specifying  exclusion  of  any  sites  of  ecological,\narchaeological, or historic importance. Although the Project will cover a wide geographical area\nand involve interventions in several sectors, there will be no major impacts, owing largely to the\nsmall scale of the investments, and the low technology and the low intensity of the construction\nworks. The IEE finds that the Project will not create any significant changes in the social,\nphysical, or biological environment.\n80. The potential impacts of two of the three major components of the Project are primarily\nconstruction related. The type of road construction will be either rehabilitation or improvement of\nexisting alignments and will fall within the existing road reserves. Little if any land acquisition is\nexpected. Mitigation measures to be taken to address any potentially minor adverse impacts in\nroad construction and rehabilitation have been detailed in the monitoring plan of the IEE. Small-\nscale  construction  under  the  community  development  component  will  have  no  significant\nadverse impacts and the communities, through the CDCs, will select sites. The small-scale\nimproved water management structures and water supplies will be selected in a similar fashion\nand will serve to make the best use of the natural run-off into the lake and the scarce inland\ngroundwater resources. Microenterprises developed by the Project through credit provision will\nalso have no significant adverse impacts. Several enterprises (e.g., social forestry, sloping lands\nagriculture development, and horticultural development) should, however, enhance watershed\nmanagement and reduce natural soil erosion.\n2.  Social Measures\n81. An initial social assessment carried out for ADB during project identification showed that\nthe rural population in the CHT was likely to be among the poorest in Bangladesh. To confirm\nthis finding and establish data and key indicators on ethnic composition, land-use patterns and\nownership, health, education, employment, gender issues, and social structures, a benchmark\nand socioeconomic survey was carried out during project preparation. The survey covered 619\nhouseholds in 12 villages or communities in all three CHT districts. The surveyed households\nrepresented all ethnic groups and were proportional to the ethnic composition of the total CHT\npopulation. The data collected was similar to that from other area surveys carried out since\n1997 and the results indicate the conditions prevailing throughout the rural areas in the CHT.", "27\nFollowing the survey, 12 participatory rural appraisals were carried out in similar communities in\nthe  three  CHT  districts.  The  appraisals  involved  399  people  from  a  wide  cross-section  of\noccupations within the communities.\n82. About 70 percent of the surveyed families had incomes below the government\u2019s food\npoverty level, placing them in the poorest of the poor category. Similar levels of poverty were\nfound across all ethnic groups. Agriculture was the main occupation, but many families had no\naccess to good quality flat land and were obliged to farm on the less fertile hilly land using\nshifting cultivation techniques. Crop yields were low and off-farm labor earnings supplemented\nagricultural income. Low child education levels and a high incidence of malaria and waterborne\ndiseases were common. The overall situation is one of extreme poverty where many families\nwho were displaced by the insurgency have yet to rebuild their livelihoods. The rehabilitation\nand reconstruction of infrastructure in rural areas has been slow and in most communities little\nhas changed since signing of the peace accord.\n83. The Project has been designed to have a measurable impact on reducing poverty in the\nrural  areas  through  providing  improved  rural  infrastructure,  community  facilities,  and  new\nincome generating opportunities. The Project is expected to reach about 52,000 families (about\n40 percent of rural families) and will use a participatory process where beneficiaries will form\npart  of  all  planning  and  implementing  activities.  This  process  and  the  potential  project\ncomponents were discussed at three project formulation workshops with prospective project\nbeneficiaries and likely Implementing Agencies. The workshops produced an agreed consensus\non the project approach.\n3.  Gender Analysis\n84. The gender analysis in the benchmark and socioeconomic survey showed that women\nare disadvantaged in terms of financial opportunities and participation in community leadership.\nFor households headed by women (about 20 percent of surveyed households), the problems\nare more severe and their low social status excludes them from most community activities. The\nsurvey found that women generally are fully responsible for the household work program and its\nfinancial management. They also participate in agricultural tasks and are usually responsible for\nhomestead enterprises, which may include livestock rearing and intensive fruit and vegetable\ncultivation. However, until the recent introduction of NGO credit programs, women have had\ngreat difficulty in obtaining loans to develop their own microenterprises. This problem appears to\nbe inherent in the traditional banking services and is the principal reason for the emergence and\nsuccess of NGOs among women.\n85. From discussions held during the survey and in the follow-up participatory rapid rural\nappraisals, women considered that the development priorities should be the provision of more\nreliable and cleaner water supplies, and better road and trail access to schools, health centers,\nand markets. The majority of women indicated that they would take advantage of income\ngenerating programs, especially those that provided support for enterprises that were managed\nfrom the homestead. They identified enterprises such as poultry, goat, and other livestock\nrearing and sericulture as suiting their existing activities. Given the opportunity, women stated\nthat  they  would  participate  in  community  decision-making  through  membership  in  local\norganizations and committees.\n86. The  Project  has  been  designed  to  respond  to  these  needs  by  improving  rural\ncommunication, which will provide for better access to education and health facilities, and small-\nscale  community  infrastructure  projects,  which  improve  village  water  supplies  and  other", "28\ncommunity facilities. Women will also be brought into the community decision-making process\nthrough membership in CDCs. In addition, they will be encouraged to expand their income-\ngenerating activities, many of which can be carried out in the home, through membership in\ngroup-based savings and credit schemes.\n4.  Indigenous Peoples Development Plan\n87. ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples does not state that all ethnic minorities are to be\ntreated as indigenous people, but it does relate the concept of indigenous peoples to ethnic\nminorities, among others. An indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) is necessary for this\nProject, because (i) slightly over one-half of the population of the project area is made up of\nethnic minority groups; and (ii) while there is significant diversity among the groups, there are\ntraditional  patterns  of  resource  use  and  social  organization  that  are  distinct  from  the\nmainstream. The IPDP provides a framework for the full participation of all ethnic minority\ngroups in the detailed planning and implementation of the Project and these mechanisms have\nbeen developed through extensive consultations with the communities and their representatives\nin the Project area.  The main aims of the IPDP are to (i) improve the living conditions of all the\nethnic minority groups by improving the rural communication network, which will give better\naccess to education, health, and trading centers and decrease the costs of transportation and\nconsumables; (ii) create job opportunities in construction and road development works for those\ngroups; (iii) offer skill development and credit to develop income generating microenterprises in\nthe remote areas; and (iv) facilitate empowerment of the ethnic minority communities through\nstrengthening their participation in local development activities.\n88. The objectives of the IPDP have been incorporated into the Project\u2019s detailed planning\nand  implementation  framework  and  these  will  be  addressed  through  (i)  comprehensive\nconsultations with the involved individual communities and villages, which will be a precursor to\nthe development of each annual plan for the rural infrastructure component; (ii) the CDCs\nformed under the Project to identify, implement, and manage small-scale infrastructure projects\nhaving all local ethnic minority groups represented in their membership; (iii) where possible,\nlocal NGOs representing specific ethnic minority groups carrying out the skill development and\ntraining activities in their tribal groups; (iv) local indigenous NGOs being employed to work with\nthe NGO credit providers; and (v) where roads are upgraded in a particular area, ethnic minority\ngroups in that area being given priority for job opportunities associated with the construction.\nThe PMU will be responsible for BME of the IPDP. The data gathered during the benchmark\nand socioeconomic survey on each of the ethnic minority groups will be used as base line\nindicators to monitor the Project\u2019s impact on each group.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic and Financial Analysis\n1.  Introduction\n89. Reviews  of  projects  in  Bangladesh  in  which  there  have  been  a  significant  road\nimprovement component have identified three main direct benefits: (i) a reduction in goods\ntransport costs of up to 40 percent as a result of reduced vehicle operating costs, (ii) a similar\nreduction in public transport fares, and (iii) a reduction in travel time. Savings in transport costs\nhave in turn lead to lower farm inputs and an improvement in product prices, which have\ntogether resulted in an increase in agricultural production. In some areas, a change to more\nintensive forms of land use has occurred.  In the nonfarm sectors, economic activity has also", "29\nincreased as a direct result of road improvement. These activities have included a range of\nservice enterprises (vehicle repair, for example), the supply of transport equipment reflecting a\nchange from nonmotorized to motorized modes of transport and small enterprise development\nsupported by a growth in NGO-managed microfinance institutions.\n90. While similar outcomes from investment in road improvement could be expected in the\nCHT, there are some important differences from the plains areas where most of the recent road\nbuilding activity in Bangladesh has occurred. First, the CHT has many steep-sided valleys\nthrough which roads must pass.  As a result, the area of good quality agricultural land, which\ncan be influenced per unit of road, is quite small. In the Third Rural Infrastructure Development\nProject (footnote 27), for example, areas of influence per km of road ranging from 900 ha to\nover 1,400 ha are quoted while comparable figures for the CHT as assessed during field work\nare  typically  30-50  ha/km.  Second,  there  are  serious  constraints  to  expanded  agricultural\nproduction (para. 12). Furthermore, uncertain land tenure arrangements together with restrictive\nlegislative provisions covering forestry are likely to constrain the development of tree crops,\nwhich could add significantly to the effective command area of new roads (Appendix 10).\n2. Beneficiaries\n91. At full development, the Project will directly benefit about 52,000 households comprising\nabout  338,000  people.  Incremental  household  incomes  have  been  estimated  at  Tk300  for\ntransport cost savings only, Tk6,400 for transport cost savings together with intensified crop\nproduction, Tk3,200 for egg production, Tk8,600 for poultry production, and Tk4,200 for pig\nfattening. The intensified crop production and livestock increments are very significant when\ncompared with typical current household incomes of between Tk20,000 and Tk30,000 per\nannum and should provide a strong incentive for beneficiary participation. As the livestock\nenterprises can be scaled to suit a range of labor and credit situations, and require limited land\nresources, landless households will have the opportunity to participate in these enterprises.\n3.  Quantifiable Benefits\n92. The  principle  quantifiable  outputs  of  the  Project  will  be  (i)  increased  agricultural\nproduction (mainly rice, vegetables, and spices) resulting from more intensive input use and\nimproved access to supporting services such as credit and technical services; (ii) household\nsavings on agricultural transport costs resulting from improved roads and market facilities; and\n(iii) increased livestock production (eggs, chickens, and pigs) arising from improved access to\nmarkets, credit, and technical services. Annual incremental crop and livestock production at full\ndevelopment is estimated at 4,560 tons (t) of unhulled rice, 2,340 t of potatoes, 68 t of ginger,\n6.16 million eggs, 1.80 million chickens, and 14,250 fattened pigs. At full development, the net\nfinancial value of incremental crop and livestock production is estimated at Tk234.64 million\n($4.60  million).  For  beneficiaries  who  do  not  intensify  output,  transport  cost  savings  from\nagricultural activities are estimated at Tk5.14 million ($100,000).\n4.  Nonquantifiable Benefits\n93. The Project will generate a wide range of nonquantifiable benefits. These will include (i)\na saving in travel time, particularly for those currently using nonmotorized means of transport on\nearth  surfaced  tracks;  (ii)  improved  delivery  of  development  services  such  as  health  and\neducation; (iii) a reduction in consumer goods prices (apart from agricultural inputs) resulting\nfrom  reductions  in  transport  costs;  (iv)  reduced  spoilage  in  markets  and  easier  access  to\nmarkets; and (v) an improvement in the general business environment engendered by more", "30\nreliable  and  cheaper  transport  services  and  improved  access  to  microfinance  services.\nFurthermore, the small-scale subprojects to be implemented by communities are expected to\nproduce a wide range of benefits. These will include improved access to safe water supplies,\ncommunity  meeting  places  perhaps  lit  with  small-scale  solar  electricity  systems,  upgraded\naccess tracks within villages, jetties, and school rooms. Community mobilization activities by\ncontracted  NGOs  will  have  long-term  benefits  in  improved  community  decision  making\nprocesses and empowerment, and improved implementation and management capacity. At the\ninstitutional level, staff of the CHTRC and HDCs, as well as members of the union councils, will\nhave  the  opportunity  to  work  closely  with  project  management  staff.  This  will  provide  an\nopportunity for them to upgrade their skills in project design and implementation, which will be\nrelevant to their work in the CHT as a whole. Finally, NGO capacity-building under the Project\nwill assist locally-based NGOs to improve their ability to deliver services to the wider community.\n5.  Economic Analysis\n94. The economic evaluation draws together the investment costs of the Project (excluding\nthose for which benefits have not been estimated) during a seven-year implementation period,\nplus the recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable benefits. These costs are then compared\nwith the estimated direct benefits, over a 30-year period. As the analysis is expressed in\neconomic  prices  at  domestic  price  levels,  tradable  components  have  been  adjusted  by  a\nshadow exchange rate factor of 1.10 to convert them to the domestic price level. The main final\nincremental outputs of the Project as evaluated are crops (primarily rice and vegetables) and\nlivestock products (eggs, chickens, and fattened pigs). In addition, transport cost savings for\nbeneficiaries who do not intensify production or adopt new livestock enterprises are included in\nthe  economic  flows.  Given  the  interdependence  of  the  rural  infrastructure  and  agricultural\nproduction activities, separate evaluations of the various components of the Project have not\nbeen attempted.\n95. As benefits from the community development component have not been assessed, the\ncost of this component has been excluded from the economic evaluation. Project management\ncosts, estimated at 30 percent of the total, have also been excluded. These costs are assessed\nas being directly related to the implementation of the community development component and\nmore general capacity building. All rural infrastructure investment costs have been included.\nEighty percent of the value of the proposed credit line has been excluded, as the costs that\nwould be financed by term loans from this proportion of the credit line are included in the various\nlivestock enterprise models that form part of the Project economic flows.\n96. For the base case, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of the Project is estimated\nat 11.9 percent. While this rate is below the assumed opportunity cost of capital (12 percent), it\nis judged to be acceptable when the nonquantifiable benefits are taken into consideration.\nSensitivity tests show that if road construction costs rise by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 10.7\npercent. If the area of land on which more intensive production technology is used and falls from\n30 percent of the total in the area of influence, as assumed in the base case, to 20 percent, the\nEIRR falls to 10.6 percent. The EIRR is also sensitive to changes in assumptions about the area\nof land influenced by each km of road. If this falls by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 11.5 percent.\nIn the unlikely event that both the prices of eggs and chickens fall by 10 percent, the EIRR\nwould fall to 10.6 percent.", "31\n6.  Subsidy and Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project\n97. Apart from grants to be made under the community development component, there will\nbe no direct subsidies paid by the Project. Beneficiaries will, however, continue to draw on the\nfree advisory services currently provided by government agencies in the area. The interest rates\nfor loans to be made under the microenterprise development component are expected to at\nleast cover the incremental lending costs of NGOs, including provisioning. O&M costs of small\nmarkets that may be financed under the Project will be met by union councils using a fixed\nproportion of the proceeds of market stall leases specifically set aside for this purpose. O&M\ncosts of facilities to be constructed under the community development component will be the\nresponsibility of the communities and community organizations established under the Project.\nRecurrent government budget costs extending beyond the seven-year project investment period\nare limited to road maintenance.\n7.  Project Risks\n98. Due to the limited development activity in the CHT during the insurgency, the capacity\nfor project design and implementation is limited (Appendix 11). New institutions were created\nout of the peace accord, and empowered to take a lead role in development activities in the\nCHT. A local indigenous NGO movement has developed approximately seven NGOs that, with\ncapacity  building  support,  could  participate  in  project  activities.  To  minimize  the  risk  that\ninstitutional  weakness  could  seriously  affect  project  implementation,  the  following  specific\ninterventions  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design:  (i)  recruitment  of  a  domestic\nconsultant knowledgeable in ADB systems and procedures to provide project management\nsupport to the MCHTA and the PMU; (ii) project management and local implementation staff will\nbe  supported  by  domestic  and  international  consultants  with  expertise  in  community\ndevelopment, training, gender issues, engineering quality control, institutional development,\ncommunications, legal services, and BME; (iii) institutional strengthening for local NGOs to build\nup their capacity; (iv) national NGOs that can provide a mix of services to facilitate effective\nimplementation of the Project; (v) only a limited amount of infrastructure is proposed for the first\nyear; and (vi) training of trainers will start in the first year.\n99. Although land ownership issues were key elements in the recent insurgency in the CHT,\ndecisive action is not being taken to address these concerns. Inaction on a proposed land\nsurvey is delaying the preparation of a new voting list of land owners, which is required before\nelections  for  HDCs  (and  indirectly  the  composition  of  the  CHTRC)  can  take  place.  The\nimplications of a delayed survey and voting list will be a continued suspicion of Government\nintentions toward tribal development and a significant risk that the more radical tribal elements\nmay return to armed conflict to achieve what they consider are their social and economic rights.\nAssurances have been sought that the Government remains committed to the land ownership\nand disputes resolution provisions of the peace accord.\n100. Participatory processes are an important element in the selection and prioritization of\nmany project activities. These procedures may be new to government institutions in the CHT\nand a more prescriptive approach could easily eventuate. To provide an appropriate overview to\nthis process, ADB and the Government must carry out reviews every six months for at least the\nfirst two years of the Project, with more in-depth reviews at the end of the second and fourth\nyears of the Project. These reviews, and compliance with all ADB procedures and policies are\nkey to ensuring that the Project is successful.  Given that the CHT has only recently emerged\nfrom a 20 year insurgency (paras. 3-6), that the CHTRC and HDCs are new organizations, and", "32\nthat participatory processes are critical to progress in the CHT generally and to the Project in\nparticular, compliance with ADB procedures and policies must be accompanied by efforts to\nensure transparency and accessibility to information by all of the project beneficiaries. This\nProject  will  incorporate  lessons  offered  from  the  Samut  Prakarn  Wastewater  Management\nProject,30 and will include the establishment of a project web site as a tool by which to manage\nthe demand for information on the Project. The web site will contain relevant documentation,\nsuch as this report, and will be regularly updated. In addition, an interdepartmental task force\n(headed by ADB\u2019s Agriculture and Social Sectors Department [West], and including Programs\nDepartment [West], Office of the General Counsel, and Office of External Relations) will be\nformed to ensure that implementation and comprehensive ADB monitoring and review of the\nProject are carried out in accordance with the project design and ADB procedures and policies.\nThe task force also will be responsible for addressing any queries from the public and from\nNGOs.\n101. Many of the roads to be constructed under the Project will pass through difficult terrain or\nwill be subject to local flooding and will have a high maintenance requirement. Overall, a\nsignificant increase in the annual road maintenance budget for the CHT will be required for\nthese and other project-financed roads to be maintained satisfactorily. Part of the maintenance\nwork will be carried out by labor contracting societies, which will need to be formed for this\nspecific purpose. The Government has assured ADB that appropriate allocations will be made\nfor road maintenance. The Project will help communities form and operate labor contracting\nsocieties.  Annual  work  planning  under  the  infrastructure  component  will  take  into  account\nGovernment (national and local) resources available for O&M.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n102. The Project has been designed to address some of the critical development needs\nidentified by communities during participatory meetings and the needs assessment survey. Most\nsurveyed families had incomes below the Government\u2019s food poverty line, placing them in the\ncategory of the poorest of the poor. Project interventions to help raise incomes include credit for\nmicroenterprise development, training in a range of enterprise types, and provision of technical\nservices. Investments in rural infrastructure are expected to lead to lower transport costs,\nimproved access to markets and government services, and growth of small businesses within\nthe CHT. Women will benefit from a number of targeted interventions. Poultry raising will\nprovide an opportunity for income generation, both for those with access to land and for the\nlandless. Women are priority borrowers in most NGO credit programs.\nC.  Project Impact on Poverty\n103. Poverty reduction remains the overriding priority in Bangladesh.  In rural areas, where\nthe large majority of the poor live, poverty reduction requires (i) continued and increased growth\nin the on-farm and nonfarm sectors, (ii) generation of self-employment microenterprises for the\npoor, (iii) more effective delivery of education and health services, and (iv) better protection\nagainst natural disasters. The target population under the Project are (i) poor shifting cultivators\nunable to meet their basic consumption needs and dependent on the sale of manual labor as\nthe main source of income; (ii) poor landless farmers with less than 0.2 ha of cereal production\nland, including homesteads, and dependent on providing manual labor as the main source of\nincome; and (iii) the absolutely poor marginal farmers with less than 0.4 ha of cereal production\nland. Successful implementation of the Project will benefit the target population who will acquire\n                                                \n30 Loan 1410-THA: Samut Prakarn Wastewater Management, for $150 million, approved on 7 December 1995.", "33\nnew  or  improved  skills;  increased  earning  opportunities  and  incomes;  better  community\norganization; and greater access to productive assets, infrastructure, and economic and social\nservices.  They also will benefit more broadly from improvements in the abilities of district and\nlocal administrations to deliver services in response to demand.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n104. The Government has given the following specific assurances, in addition to the standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, a suitably qualified project director,\nacceptable to ADB, will have been recruited using an open and competitive\nrecruitment process, to replace the interim project director.\n(ii)  Within six months of loan effectiveness, the DPMUs in Bandarban, Khagrachari,\nand Rangamati, will have been established and equipped with necessary office\nfurniture and equipment, including telephones, and staffed with key personnel,\nincluding the deputy project directors, as agreed with ADB.\n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the CHTRC and the HDCs receive their annual\nbudget  allocations  on  time,  including  all  allocations  for  staffing  and  the\nimplementation of this Project, and that such budget allocations are sufficient to\nenable the CHTRC and HDCs to remain fully staffed with appropriate personnel\n(officer and class III level staff in the Governments civil service classification\nsystem), so as to properly discharge their responsibilities as executing agency\nand implementing agencies under this Project.\n(iv)  Prior to the carrying out of any civil works under the Project, the (a) CHTRC will\nconfirm that it concurs with the site of the concerned civil works; and (b) the\nGovernment  will  confirm  that  the  site  for  the  concerned  civil  works  is  on\nundisputed land.\n(v)  The Government will ensure that the CHTRC, HDCs, PMU, DPMUs, LGED, and\nother participating agencies or organizations take the necessary steps to have\nthe local tribal population and women living in the project area participate fully in\nplanning and implementing project activities. The CHTRC will ensure that tribal\nwomen are appropriately represented in Project social mobilization and training\nprograms, and that preference is given to all women (tribal and nontribal) in the\nprovision of microfinance.\n(vi)  The CHTRC, HDCs, and PMU will ensure that the local NGOs primarily focus on\nsupplying services to the tribal population and women, and that at least 70\npercent of their subborrowers under the microfinance component of the Project\nare women.\n(vii)  The Government will ensure that the Project facilities upgraded under the rural\ninfrastructure component of the Project will be properly operated and maintained\nas follows: (a) the LGED will carry out routine and periodic maintenance of\nimproved feeder roads type B and rural roads using the Government's annual", "34\nmaintenance fund; (b) the LGED will submit annually to the Government budgets\nto cover the cost of routine and periodic maintenance of structures improved\nunder the Project; (c) the Government will include in its annual budget adequate\nprovision for the LGED to carry out such maintenance; and (d) the LGED will\nprovide  additional  resources  for  O&M  from  its  Rural  Maintenance  Program\n(supported by the World Food Programme) to the Project.\n(viii)  The LGED will ensure that adverse environmental impacts resulting from the civil\nworks financed under the rural infrastructure component of the Project will be\nmitigated, and appropriate ADB and Government environmental safeguards are\nadopted in relation to noise, dust, air pollution, safety standards, soil erosion, and\nsanitation measures, in accordance with the relevant governing environmental\nlaws and regulations.\nB. Conditions for Loan Effectiveness\n105. Prior to loan effectiveness\n(i)  the Government will have approved the project proforma for the Project, which\nwill be prepared by MCHTA with the assistance of LGED;\n(ii)  the CHTRC will have established the PMU in Rangamati and equipped the PMU\nwith the necessary office furniture and equipment, including telephones;\n(iii)  all  personnel  (excluding  the  public  relations  officer,  two  surveyors,  and  the\nspeedboat driver) of the CHTRC as set forth in its approved organization chart,\nand as agreed with ADB, will have been appointed and will have commenced\ntheir duties to the CHTRC; and\n(iv)  the Government and Danida will have executed the Danida Grant Agreement.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n106. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to\nSpecial Drawing Rights 23,251,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Chittagong\nHill Tracts Rural Development Project, with a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8\nyears, and with an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period\nand 1.5 percent per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially\nin accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Implementation Agreements\npresented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n3 October 2000", "35\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page  Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 36 1,2\n2 Rural Poverty in Bangladesh and in the 41 3,8\nChittagong Hill Tracts\n3 External Assistance to Rural Development Sector 47 7,22\n4  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan 49 17,49\n5 Project Organization Chart 52 22,66\n6 Implementation Schedule 53 22,67\n7 Equipment and Vehicles for Procurement 54 23,70\n8 Terms of Reference for Consulting Services 55 24,71\n9 Project Funds Flow Chart 61 26,78\n 10 Economic and Financial Analyses 62 29,90\n11  Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threat 71 31,98\nAnalysis of Chittagong Hill Tracts Organizations\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Nongovernment Organizations in the CHT\nB Detailed Cost Tables\nC Initial Environmental Examination\nD Benchmark Survey and Key Indicators\nE Tribal Development Plan", "36\nAppendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Targets Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks\n1.

Background\n1. The most recent country-wide evidence on the poverty status1 shows that 36 percent of\nBangladesh\u2019s population was very poor and 53 percent was poor.2 The incidence of poverty has\ndeclined since 1991-1992 as measured by both the lower and upper poverty lines. However, the\ndrop in poverty was larger in urban than rural areas. For the decade from 1985 through 1995,\nrural poverty remained much higher than urban poverty as measured with both the lower and\nupper poverty lines. The data from the household expenditure survey (HES) indicates there are\nseveral key social indicators which are correlated with poverty.\n2.  Education. Families in which the head of household did not have any education had a\nhigher probability of being poor. Nationally, the headcount index for very poor households was 48\npercent if headed by a person without schooling, and 7 percent if the head had completed\nsecondary schooling and above. Using the upper poverty line, 67 percent of households with\nheads with no schooling were poor across the country compared to 16 percent of households\nwith heads who had completed the secondary certificate and above. Poverty falls as the level of\neducation  of  the  household  head  rises,  and  it  falls  faster  in  urban  areas  than  rural  areas,\nsuggesting higher returns to education in urban areas.\n3. Occupation of the Head of Household. In the rural sector, owner-farmers had the\nlowest probability of being poor (20 percent within the lower poverty lines), followed by workers in\nnonagricultural activities (38 percent); tenant farmers (42 percent); workers in fisheries, forestry,\nand livestock (45 percent); agricultural workers with family land (51 percent); and agricultural\nworkers without family land (75 percent). In the nonagricultural sector, most high-level employees\n(executives, officials, professionals, and teachers) and most small businessmen and petty traders\nescape poverty. Factory workers and artisans rank below them, followed by salespeople, service\nworkers, and transport and communication workers. Servants and day laborers had relatively\nhigh poverty rates. Households where the head was not working do not fare so badly, probably\nbecause they had other sources of income or support that allowed the head not to work. Heads\nwho had a second occupation tended to be in the poorer households, suggesting that the second\noccupation is pursued out of necessity. An exception was households whose heads have a\nsecond occupation as an owner-farmer.\n4. Rural Farm versus Nonfarm Workers. There has been debate in Bangladesh over the\nliving standards of the rural farm versus the nonfarm workers.3 The traditional view has held that\nthe bulk of nonfarm activities are residual, low productivity occupations which the landless poor\nare pushed into. Therefore, the growth of the rural nonfarm sector is interpreted as a sign of\nweakness rather than strength in rural development. If that were the case, rural nonfarm workers\nwould be employed in residual activities, receiving extremely low wages, and their poverty rates\nwould be higher than rural agricultural landless households. But the 1995-1996 HES showed that\nrural households whose heads are landless agricultural workers are the poorest. This finding\nsupports the alternate view of the development of the nonfarm sector, which maintains that\ngrowth of the nonfarm sector pulls people out of poverty in rural areas. Promoting the rural\n                                                \n1  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 1998. Household Expenditure Survey (1995-1996).\n2  Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics uses a cost of basic needs (CBN) indicator which, expressed in taka per person\nper month, sets three poverty levels (food, lower, and upper). The very poor are categorized as falling below the\nfood and lower poverty levels and the poor are categorized as falling below the upper poverty level.\n3 World Bank. 1996.  Bangladesh \u2013 Rural Infrastructure Strategy.", "42\nAppendix 2, page 2\nnonfarm sector, including fisheries, livestock, and forestry is already a strong ingredient of the\nmicrofinance programs of the nongovernment organizations (NGOs); therefore such promotion\nrepresents an attractive policy option for reducing poverty in rural areas.\n5. Gender Disparities. Rural households headed by women had a higher probability of\nbeing  among  the  very  poor  than  households  headed  by  men  (45  percent  compared  to  39\npercent).  The  headcount  ratios  for  poor  households  were  virtually  identical  for  households\nheaded by females and males. Because households headed by females had smaller families and\nper capita consumption data was used as a welfare indicator, shown poverty among smaller\nfamilies was underestimated compared to larger families, and in households headed by women.\nAnd, if the distribution of consumption within households favors men, poverty among women is\nlikely to be higher still.\n6. While poverty is best measured by comparing per capita consumption to a poverty line,\nother dimensions of well-being are not captured by such measures. Women in Bangladesh lack\naccess to health and education, and have a lower life expectancy than men at birth. Moreover, in\n1993 the ratio of female-to-male child mortality was 1.33, and the ratio of female-to-male children\nwho  received  no  treatment  for  episodes  of  fever  or  acute  respiratory  infection  was  1.19.\nBangladesh\u2019s gender performance in education is better: the ratio of female-to-male enrolment for\nchildren aged 11 to 14 was 0.93 in 1993, well above the South Asian median of 0.70. Yet girls still\nlag behind boys, especially in secondary and higher education. Girls are less likely than boys to\nattend post-primary school, and they are less likely to complete school when they do attend.\nMoreover, women represent a small minority of teachers: 19 percent in primary education and\nonly 10 percent in secondary education.4\n7. Attitudes Toward Women. Attitudes toward women are an important social determinant\nof equity, access to public services, and women\u2019s well-being. The rural community module of the\n1995-1996 HES provides important information on village attitudes, of both men and women,\ntoward women\u2019s participation in income-generating activities, education, and family planning. Men\nand women have different attitudes toward women taking up income-generating activities: in\nalmost 75 percent of villages most women strongly favored doing so, but that view was held by a\nmajority of men in less than half the villages. Support for female education is universally higher\nthan support for income-generating activities and is more even between men and women. Strong\nor very strong support for female education was the majority view of women in 90 percent of the\nvillages and the majority view of men in 84 percent of the villages. There are many villages (over\n20 percent) in which men oppose or strongly oppose women engaging in income-generating\nactivities, but almost none where they oppose women\u2019s education. Most men support family\nplanning for women in 56 percent of the villages; most women do so in 65 percent of the villages.\nB. Policies for Increasing Pro-Poor Economic Growth\n8. Bangladesh\u2019s economic growth has exceeded its population growth, especially since the\nearly 1990s. The gross domestic product (GDP) growth has averaged around 4 percent over the\npast 12 years, and was 4.4 percent in the period 1991-1997, whereas the population growth was\nabout 2 percent. This should have resulted in increased consumption and reduced poverty. Yet\npoverty declined slowly, with no net gains between 1983 and 1992. Rural poverty in particular has\nremained very high and the actual number of poor has increased over time.\n                                                \n4 World Bank. 1996. Bangladesh \u2013 Education Review.", "43\nAppendix 2, page 3\n9. A recent analysis5 showed that a rising inequality had accompanied the growth in GDP\nand the actual pattern of growth in per capita consumption without the changes in equality would\nhave been about 10 percentage points lower in FY1995/96 than was observed. The analysis\nhighlighted  the  need  for  a  better  understanding  of  the  likely  implications  of  various  growth\npatterns and the microeconomic determinants of inequality so that public policies may help to\nreduce  inequality  over  time.  It  posed  the  following  questions:  How  would  different  sectoral\npatterns of growth affect poverty? How does the saving to finance investment affect poverty?\nThe analysis examined three simple scenarios \u2014 one with steadily accelerating growth, one with\nhigher growth coming from services, and one with higher growth coming from agriculture.\n10. A simulation of these scenarios suggested (i) if economic growth accelerates, it will lead to\nsignificant  poverty  reduction,  even  after  taking  into  account  the  potential  impact  of  rising\ninequality; (ii) to the extent that Bangladesh makes better use of the concessional foreign aid to\nwhich it has access, the impact of higher growth on poverty would be large, and to the extent that\nsafety nets better protect the consumption of the poorest, the impact of faster growth on poverty\nwould be greater; and (iii) growth based on faster agricultural growth would bring additional gains\nin poverty reduction, and reduce inequality.\nC. Microeconomic Determinants of Poverty\n11. In addition to broad-based economic growth, investment in the poor\u2019s human and physical\ncapital are widely recognized to reduce poverty. Further analysis by the World Bank of the 1995-\n1996 HES (para. 1) made the following conclusions and suggested certain policy implications.\n12. Returns to Education. Holding other household characteristics constant, for a household\nwhose head completes primary school, consumption rises 19 percent per capita in urban areas\nand 7 percent per capita in rural areas compared to a household head who had no education. For\nsecondary school, the gain is 48 percent for urban areas and 17 percent for rural areas. The\ngains are high for spouses. These figures have been relatively stable since 1983 and have\nincreased for women. The gains from education have remained huge, despite recent increases in\nunemployment among the better educated, warranting greater investment in education. The\nincreasing gains from education for spouses in rural households may denote greater participation\nof women in income-generating activities.\n13. Returns to land ownership, occupation, demographics, wages, and employment.\nLandlessness increases the probability of being poor, as do certain occupations. In agriculture,\nowner-farmers  are  best  off,  followed  by  tenant  farmers,  workers  in  fisheries,  forestry,  and\nlivestock, and agricultural workers with  land. Factory workers, artisans, salespeople, service\nworkers  and  transportation  workers  fare  better  than  agricultural  workers.  Real  wages  have\nincreased  but  agricultural  wages  have  lagged  behind  other  forms  of  employment.  While\nunemployment is relatively low, underemployment remains high, especially in rural areas. Given\nthe potential political and administrative constraints to land distribution, promoting the nonfarm\nsector, microfinance programs, and human capital investment is a good strategy to raise the\nstandard of living of landless agricultural workers. Nonfarm-related investments in the poorest\nregions would reduce poverty the most, although the absolute gains from joining the nonfarm\nsector may be greater in the better-off regions. The slower rise in agricultural wages is consistent\nwith  the  slower  decline  in  rural  poverty.  Policies  should  be  implemented  to  reduce\nunderemployment in rural areas, for example by providing better opportunities for women.\n                                                \n5 World Bank. 1998.  Bangladesh-From Counting the Poor to Making the Poor Count.", "44\nAppendix 2, page 4\n14. Area  Determinants  of  Poverty.  Differences  in  poverty  between  geographic  areas\ndepend more on different area characteristics than on differences of households located in these\nareas. Policing targeted investments to poor regions should be supported. These could include\ninvestments  in  rural  roads  and  bridges,  marketing  facilities,  health  and  school  facilities,\nmicrofinance, energy, and communications.\n15. Determinants of Inequality. Land ownership drives inequality the most in rural areas. In\nboth urban and rural areas, location is the second largest determinant of inequality. Occupation\nhas a lesser impact. Enabling the poor to complete primary education is inequality-reducing, as is\ninvesting  in  poorer  regions  and  eliminating  land-labor  failures  that  further  skew  rural  land\ndistribution.  Transfer  and  skill  building  such  as  Food-for-Work  and  Vulnerable  Group\nDevelopment programs  reduce inequality.\nD. Public Expenditures and Government Safety Net Programs\n16. Effective public spending, including spending on rural infrastructure in addition to social\nsector programs and safety nets, can reduce poverty. Public social sector expenditures rose from\nTk8 billion in FY1989/90 to Tk28.5 billion in FY1995/96 in constant FY1995/96 prices. Real\neducation spending has increased the most, both in absolute and real terms from Tk3.14 billion in\nFY1989/90 to Tk5.85 billion in FY1995/96. Education and health represented 80 percent of the\nAnnual  Development  Plan  (ADP)  social  spending  in  FY1995/96.  Overall,  the  share  of\nBangladesh\u2019s ADP devoted to education, health, social welfare, and family planning has more\nthan doubled since FY1989/90 from 10 to 24 percent.\n17. Safety  Nets  in  Bangladesh  Serve  Transfer  Payment  and  Human  Capital\nAccumulation Objectives. There is a long tradition of safety nets established by external food\naid. The three biggest programs are Food-for-Work, which provides wheat in exchange for work\non  rural  infrastructure  projects,  Food-for-Education  which  initially  provided  wheat  and  now\nprovides wheat and rice to poor children in return for regular primary school attendance, and\nVulnerable  Group  Development,  which  provides  food  grains  and  training  to  disadvantaged\nwomen. Test Relief is a smaller program used to support activities like cleaning ponds and\nbushes, and making minor repairs to rural roads, schools, and  mosques during the rainy season.\nFood-for-Work is by far the largest program but the fastest growing and second largest program\nis Food-for-Education, which started in FY1993/94 in selected rural villages.\n18. Public safety net programs such as those mentioned above play an important role in\nprotecting the poor and in building rural infrastructure and human capital. Given the persistence\nof  high  poverty  rates  and  the  observed  increases  in  inequality,  these  programs  should  be\npursued. Monetization of these programs could bring additional benefits by reducing costs and\navoiding risks of distortions in food markets and in farmer decision-making of enterprises.\nE. NGO Programs\n19. Bangladesh is known internationally for its innovative NGOs, which have grown rapidly.\nThe number of NGOs registered with the NGO Affairs Bureau has tripled since 1990 to about\n1,200 in 1997. In some areas the size of NGO programs is now on a par with the size of\ngovernment programs. While the influence of NGOs and their reliance on foreign funding has\nbeen a source of tension with the government in the past, the situation has improved and\npartnerships with NGOs are now being more common.\n20. Microfinance programs such as those provided by the Bangladesh Rural Agricultural\nCooperative (BRAC), Association for Social Advancement (ASA), Proshika, and Grameen Bank", "45\nAppendix 2, page 5\nare among the best known. The Grameen Bank had 2.06 million microcredit clients in 1996, and\nBRAC, Proshika, and ASA has 1.84 million, 1.30 million, and 0.57 million, respectively. This puts\nthe size of these organizations on par with the Bangladesh Rural Development Board (BRDB),\nthe government\u2019s microfinance agency. In addition to microfinance, NGOs provide skill training,\neducation, health, family planning, and water supply and sanitation services. NGOs are also\nactive  in  managing  common  property  resources,  extending  nontraditional  agriculture,  and\ninitiating income generating activities. For these activities as well, some NGO programs have\nreached  the  size  of  similar  government  programs.  BRAC\u2019s  Non-Formal  Primary  Education\nprogram operated 34,175 schools in 1996, enrolling 1.1 million students in 22,602 villages. By\ncomparison, the Food-for-Education program served about 2 million children that year. NGOs\nhave also diversified their activities: BRAC acts as a financial intermediary providing microcredit\nto landless women nationwide and, for example, supports research on plant tissue culture to\nimprove  agribusiness  opportunities  in  fruit  and  vegetable  cultivation.  Grameen  operates  the\nGrameen  Bank  and  has  sponsored  Grameen  Telecom,  which  provides  cellular  telephone\nservices, and likewise Proshika, which acts as an internet provider.\n21. Microfinance programs are effective in fighting poverty. The large NGO microfinance\ninstitutions are becoming more sustainable over time because of their system of group-based\ncollateral and high repayment rates. The vastly superior performance of NGO rural health and\neducation  services  offers  possibilities  of  partnerships  with  public  agencies  to  broaden  their\npoverty reduction successes.\nF. Rural Poverty in the Chittagong Hill Tracts\n22. No official data is available on the poverty status in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).\nHowever, the benchmark and socioeconomic survey conducted in all three districts during project\npreparation showed that about 70 percent of the 619 rural families surveyed from all ethnic\ngroupings,  had  incomes  that  were  below  the  food  poverty  level,6  the  lowest  level  in  the\nGovernment\u2019s poverty index. This figure is about twice the national average for rural areas in\nBangladesh (footnote 1). The BMS also determined that the principal perceived problems of the\nrural communities were poor communications, a lack of drinking and irrigation water, and a lack of\nincome-generating opportunities.\n23. The  reasons  for  this  extreme  poverty  are  several.  The  lands  are  not  productive.\nNationally,  about  70  percent  of  Bangladesh  soils  are  cultivatable  and  have  few  production\nlimitations. The equivalent figure in the CHT is about 6 percent  and its generally poor soils and\nsteep contours severely limit the production enterprise options. The creation of Lake Kaptai in\n1960, took about 20,000 ha of the CHT's best agricultural land and permanently left the CHT as a\ncereal deficit area. The in-migration of people from the plains districts in the late 1970s to early\n1980s exacerbated the pressures on the remaining agricultural land and the resulting insurgency\nwar internally displaced many families. Much of the hilly land that could offer income generating\nopportunities in social forestry, is either under the exclusive control of the Forestry Department or\nis subject to forestry regulations that deter private forestry investments.\n24. Reducing  poverty  in  the  rural  areas  is  directly  addressed  through  a  group  of  public\nexpenditure programs associated with the development of rural infrastructure. These programs\ninclude Food-for-Work, Vulnerable Group Development, and Rural Maintenance and serve both\ntransfer payment and human capital accumulation objectives. Food-for-Work provides wheat in\n                                                \n6 Seventy percent of surveyed families earned less than Tk30,000 per annum which is below the food poverty line\n(poorest of the poor)  figure of Tk35,000 per annum for Chittagong Division established in the Bangladesh Bureau\nof Statistics\u2019 HES for FY1995/96 and updated to 1999.", "46\nAppendix 2, page 6\nexchange for work on rural infrastructure projects, Vulnerable Group Development provides food\ngrains and training to disadvantaged women, and Rural Maintenance employs destitute women in\nlabor intensive rural road maintenance. All of these programs are operating in the CHT and they\nmake a significant contribution to rural incomes.7\n25. Supporting the public sector programs is a parallel set of NGO programs which are\nfocused on skills development backed up with microfinance. The national NGO operations of\nBRAC, Integrated Development Foundation, and Proshika did not start in the CHT until 1997 and\ntheir activities have been limited by tribal leadership concerns about the potential erosion of\ncultural values through the NGO development approach. There is an ongoing dialogue which\naims to resolve these outstanding issues.\n                                                \n7 World Food Programme Special Assistance to the CHT 1998-1999 \u2013 providing food assistance to 34,172 people.", "47\nAppendix 3, page 1\nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT SECTOR\n(FROM 1990 \u2013 PRESENT)\nAmount\nProject Source of Funds ($ million) Status\nSmallholder Livestock Development IFAD-Danida 15.3 Closed\nAgricultural Research Management Project IDA-World Bank 50.0 Ongoing\nMarginal and Small Farm Systems Crop IFAD-GTZ 8.0 Closed\nIntensification Project\nNetrakona Integrated Agricultural Production IFAD-WFP 6.4 Closed\nand Water Management Project\nDuckweed Research Project Netherlands 10.0 Ongoing\nRural Development Project 3 IDB 33.4 Ongoing\nRural Development Project 4 Sida 17.2 Ongoing\nRural Development Project 14 GTZ 22.0 Closed\nRural Development Project 16 Danida 65.0 Closed\nNortheast Minor Irrigation ADB 73.0 Closed\nSecond Bhola Irrigation ADB 39.8 Closed\nRural Poor Cooperative ADB 28.9 Closed\nSecond Rural Infrastructure Development ADB 83.4 Closed\nProject\nCommand Area Development ADB 30.0 Ongoing\nForestry Sector ADB 50.0 Ongoing\nParticipatory Livestock Development Project ADB-Denmark 38.0 Ongoing\nThird Rural Infrastructure Development ADB 70.0 Ongoing\nRural Livelihood ADB 42.6 Ongoing\nHorticulture Development ADB 22.6 Closed\nCrop Diversification Project Netherlands 18.0 Ongoing\nNorthwest Fisheries Development Project DFID 4.0 Ongoing\nVegetable Research USAID-Japan 1.0 Ongoing\nIntegrated Soil Fertility and Fertilizer Denmark 3.2 Closed\n   Management Project\nAgricultural Services Innovation and World Bank 14.0 Ongoing\n   Reform Project DFID-FAO\nThana Cereal Technology Transfer and UNDP/FAO 4.0 Ongoing\n   Identification Project\nStrengthening of Seed Certification Agency Denmark 4.0 Ongoing\nStrengthening National Vegetable Seed Denmark/ 4.0 Ongoing\nProduction through Private Sector Belgium/FAO\n   Participation\nBangladesh-German Seed Development GTZ/EU 5.7 Ongoing\n   Project\nAgro-based Industries and Technology USAID 26.0 Closed\n   Development Project\nFarm-to-Market Enterprise  Development Canada 14.0 Ongoing\n   Project", "48\nAppendix 3, page 2\nAmount\nProject Source of Funds ($ million) Status\nFoodcrops Development Program Loan ADB 125.0 Closed\nNational Minor Irrigation Project EU 88.0 Closed\nConstruction of Bridge/Culverts through USAID 26.5 Closed\nMonetized  USAID Food Aid Provided u\nunder PL-480, Title-III\nRural Maintenance Programme (3rd Phase) CIDA 59.9 Closed\nIntegrated Food Assisted Development EU 25.5 Closed\nProject\nGrowth Center Connecting Road Programme WFP 40.3 Ongoing\nIntegrated Food for Development Project USAID 123.6 Closed\nRural Training ADB 16.3 Closed\nRural Women Employment Creation ADB 8.0 Closed\nPoverty Alleviation Microfinance Project IDA 105.0 Ongoing\nRural Development Project 5 (Phase III) NORAD 5.9 Ongoing\nRural Bittaheen Project CIDA 9.7 Closed\nPeople\u2019s Participatory Capacity Building UNDP 4.2 Ongoing\nProject\nKurigram Poverty Alleviation Project Norway 1.9 Ongoing\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CIDA = Canadian International Development Agency, Danida = Danish International\nDevelopment Agency, DFID = UK Department for International Development, EU = European Union, FAO = Food and\nAgriculture Organization, GTZ = German Agency for Technical Cooperation, IDA = International Development\nAssociation (World Bank), IFAD = International Fund for Agricultural Development, NORAD = Norwegian Agency for\nInternational Cooperation, Sida = Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, UNDP = United Nations\nDevelopment Programme, USAID = United States Agency for International Development, WFP = World Food\nProgramme.", "49      \n    Appendix 4, page 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\nTable A4.1: Components Project Cost Summary\n(Tk million) ($ million)\nLocal Foreign Total Local Foreign Total\nA.

Background and Approach\n1.  Reviews  of  projects  in  Bangladesh  in  which  there  have  been  a  significant  road\nimprovement component have identified three main direct benefits: (i) a reduction in goods\ntransport costs of up to 40 percent as a result of reduced vehicle operating costs, (ii) a similar\nreduction in public transport fares, and (iii) a reduction in travel time. Savings in transport costs\nhave in turn led to lower farm input prices and an improvement in product prices, which have\ntogether resulted in an increase in agricultural production. In some areas, a change to more\nintensive forms of land use has occurred.\n2.  In the nonfarm sectors, economic activity has also increased as a direct result of road\nimprovement. These activities have included a range of service enterprises (vehicle repair, for\nexample),  the  supply  of  transport  equipment  reflecting  a  change  from  nonmotorized  to\nmotorized modes of transport and small enterprise development supported by growth in credit\nprovision managed by nongovernment organizations (NGOs).\n3.  While similar outcomes from investment in road improvement could be expected in the\nChittagong Hill Tracts (CHT), there are some important differences from the plains areas in\nwhich most of the recent road building activity in Bangladesh has occurred. First, the terrain in\nthe CHT is characterized by many steep sided valleys through which roads must necessarily\npass. As a result, the area of good quality agricultural land that can be influenced per unit of\nroad is quite small. In the preparation of the Third Rural Infrastructure Development Project, for\nexample, areas of influence per kilometer (km) of road ranging from 900 hectares (ha) to over\n1,400 ha are quoted, while comparable figures for the CHT as assessed during field work are\ntypically 30-50 ha/km.\n4.  Second, there are serious constraints to expanded agricultural production. Areas of high\nquality  soils  are  very  limited  and  perennial  irrigation  sources  are  not  widely  available.\nFurthermore, uncertain land tenure arrangements together with restrictive legislative provisions\ncovering  forestry  are  likely  to  constrain  the  development  of  tree  crops  that  could  add\nsignificantly to the effective command area of new roads.\n5.  Another important difference between the plains and the CHT is the availability of data.\nThere is almost no traffic survey data for the CHT, and no CHT-specific vehicle operating cost\ndata for the classes of roads to be upgraded under the project.\n6.  In  the  evaluation  that  follows,  all  of  the  benefits  from  the  infrastructure  investment\ncomponent are assumed to be captured by agricultural producers, who will be supported by\nproject investment in credit and technical services.\n7.  Quantified benefits of the Project are (i) reductions in general goods transport costs\nresulting from improvements to the road network; (ii) intensification of crop production through\nprovision of term and seasonal finance, technical services, and improved access to markets;\nand (iii) expanded output of livestock products, particularly table eggs, broilers, and fattened\npigs through provision of seasonal finance, technical services, and improved access to markets.\nBenefits from the community-based investments to be supported by the Project or from the\ninstitutional strengthening activities to be undertaken have not been quantified, neither have the\ninvestment costs directly related to these activities been included in the analysis.", "63\nAppendix 10, page 2\nB.  Exchange Rate and Price Assumptions\n8.  Exchange  Rate.  A  trade-weighted  shadow  exchange  rate  of  Tk56=$1  has  been\nassumed giving a shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) of 1.10, which has been used in the\neconomic analysis.\n9.  Price Assumptions. The economic analysis is presented using a domestic price level\nnumeraire. Since the incremental output from participating households will be relatively small\ncompared to total market volumes, price impacts are expected to be minimal.\n10.  For the major outputs, relevant price considerations are (i) incremental rice production\nwill substitute for imports and prices have been determined on this basis (including allowance\nfor  reductions  in  transport  costs  expected  as  a  result  of  project  investments)  assuming\ncompetitive markets in the CHT; and (ii) potatoes, fruit, and poultry products are not, in general,\ntraded although their prices are competitively determined \u2014 anecdotal evidence suggests that\neggs do come across the border from India from time to time, introducing a further element of\ncompetition in price determination.\n11.   Fertilizers are the main traded inputs and prices have been estimated at farmgate\nborder equivalents using medium term price projections. All other inputs have been valued at\ntheir competitive local financial value.\n12.  As transport costs are competitively determined, it is expected that reductions in vehicle\noperating costs resulting from road improvements to be carried out under the Project will be\nreflected in reduced charges. Based on the experience of other rural infrastructure projects in\nBangladesh, it is assumed that general goods freight costs will fall by 40 percent. These\nbenefits are expected to arise within a year of each section of road being completed.\n13.   Farm family labor has been costed in the financial analysis at Tk70 per day on the basis\nof actual wages found in the area. For the economic analysis, an opportunity cost of labor of 80\npercent of this rate has been assumed. Much of the work will be carried out by females who\ntypically earn a lower wage rate than males, which supports the assumption of an opportunity\ncost of less than market rates.\nC.  Financial Analysis\n1.  Benefit Area and Households\n14.  Data collected during the feasibility study indicate that each km of completed feeder road\ntype B (FRB) will have an area of influence of about 48 ha.  As rural roads will, in general, be\nconstructed in areas where agricultural land is interspersed with infertile land, their area of\ninfluence is estimated at 41 ha/km. Table A10.1 shows areas of influence for each class of road\nto be constructed together with an estimate of the number of households (24,000) in this area,\nassuming a household farm size of 0.75 ha.\n15.  Survey data also indicates that land use in a typical area of influence comprises rice at\nabout 77 percent of the total; vegetables such as potato and squash, 9 percent; spices such as\nginger and turmeric, 6 percent; and fruit crops about 8 percent. In addition, many households\nsupplement their food production from settled agriculture with shifting cultivation on steeper hills\nsurrounding the area of influence. Many households also have livestock enterprises such as\nchicken and pig raising.", "64\nAppendix 10, page 3\nTable A10.1:   Road Areas of Influence and Household Numbers\nDistrict Unit FRB RR Total\nArea per km road ha       48       41\nRoad length\nBandarban km       20 73 93\nKhagrachari km       20      230 250\nRangamati km       35        48 83\n   Total km       75      351 426\nArea of Influence\nBandarban ha     960   2,993 3,953\nKhagrachari ha     960   9,430 10,390\nRangamati ha  1,680   1,968 3,648\n   Total ha  3,600 14,391 17,991\nArea per household ha 0.75\nHouseholds:\nBandarban no. 5,271\nKhagrachari no. 13,853\nRangamati no. 4,864\n   Total no. 23,988\nFRB = feeder road type  B, ha = hectare, km = kilometer, RR = rural road.\n2.  Producer Responses to Project Investments\n16.  Three broad patterns of response to project investments are expected within the project\narea:\n(i)  Seventy percent of existing households within the area of influence of roads to be\nconstructed under the Project will benefit from reduced transport costs but will\nnot intensify their agricultural production. There will be no incremental physical\noutput  from  these  households.  Financial  benefits  to  these  producers  will  be\nreflected in increased household savings or consumption.\n(ii)  Thirty percent of households in the same area will respond to reduced transport\ncosts,  improved  access  to  markets,  availability  of  seasonal  finance  and\navailability  of  technical  services  (all  to  be  provided  under  the  Project)  by\nincreasing input use and output.\n(iii)  Within  the  project  area  as  a  whole,  households  will  invest  in  new  livestock\nenterprises  including  egg  production,  broiler  production,  and  pig  fattening.\nImproved access to credit and technical services will be important factors in this", "65\nAppendix 10, page 4\ngrowth. These households will include those both within the area of influence of\nnew roads and in areas covered by existing roads.\n17.  Beneficiary numbers are shown in Table A10.2.\nTable A10.2:  Beneficiary Numbers\n                      No.  of\nEnterprise\n                Households\nCrop Production\nPrice changes only 16,800\nPrice changes and new technology 7,200\nSubtotala 24,000\nPoultry Layerb 10,000\nPoultry Broilerc 13,000\nPig Fattenerd 5,000\nTotal Households 52,000\na Total households from Table A10.1 above.\nb Six local birds and 6 high yield value birds.\nc 150 high yield value broilers.\nd Typical unit has three fatteners.\n3.  Financial Benefits to Crop Producers\n18.  With and without project gross margins for representative crops in the area of influence\nhave been estimated for both cost reduction and production increase options. For households\nthat intensify output, main changes with the project are an increase in fertilizer use together with\nvarietal changes.

For a typical beneficiary household with 0.75 ha of land, the improvement in gross\nmargin where only transport cost savings are assumed is Tk306. Where output is intensified,\nthe incremental gross margin is estimated at Tk6,400. This latter amount is very significant\nwhen compared with current incomes of between Tk20,000 and Tk30,000 per household and\nshould provide a strong incentive for beneficiary participation.\n4.  Financial Benefits to Livestock Producers\n21.  Financial models have been prepared for three livestock enterprises: (i) egg production,\n(ii) broiler production, and (iii) pig fattening. A typical egg producer would have a flock of 12\nlayers comprising six locally bred and six improved birds while a typical broiler enterprise would\ncomprise 150 birds. A typical pig fattening unit would have three animals. A summary of the\nincremental gross margins from these enterprises, together with an indication of the credit\nrequired, is shown in Table A10.5.", "67\nAppendix 10, page 6\nTable A10.5: Incremental Gross Margins and Labor Return-Livestock Enterprises\nIncremental Return to Credit\nEnterprise Gross Margin Labor Need FIRR\n(Tk) (Tk) (Tk) (%)\nPoultry Layer 3,220         88 2,100 >50%\nPoultry Broiler 8,613       328 7,500 >50%\nPig Fattening 4,175         46 5,500 >50%\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return.\n22.  Margins and return to labor from livestock enterprises are satisfactory when compared to\nhousehold  returns  from  crop  production  enterprises,  and  therefore  should  be  attractive  to\nbeneficiaries. A further advantage is that these enterprises are very suitable for women, while\nchildren can also help with activities such as poultry feeding. Production systems for smallholder\npoultry are in widespread use in Bangladesh with the result that the technology is well tested.\nBoth of the poultry enterprises can be reduced in size to fit the particular labor and financial\nresources of beneficiaries, as there are few fixed investments involved.\n23.  Credit requirements, including seasonal finance, range from Tk2,100 in the case of a\nlayer enterprise to Tk7,500 for broilers. Enterprise cash flows can support a one-year repayment\nperiod, which is the typical term for microfinance loans in Bangladesh.\nD.  Economic Evaluation\n1.  Introduction\n24.  The economic evaluation draws together the investment costs of the Project (excluding\nsubprojects for which benefits have not been estimated) during a 7-year implementation period,\nplus the recurrent costs needed to ensure sustainable benefits. These costs are then compared\nwith the estimated direct benefits, over a 30-year period. With the exception of rice, triple\nsuperphosphate, muriate of potash, and urea, the prices for which have been estimated in\nborder-equivalent  terms,  the  final  inputs  and  outputs  of  the  Project  have  been  valued  at\ncompetitive market prices, at farmgate, after adjusting for taxes and duties. As the analysis is\nexpressed  in  economic  prices  at  domestic  price  levels,  tradable  components  have  been\nadjusted by the shadow exchange rate factor to convert them to the domestic price level.\n2.  Final Incremental Outputs\n25.  The main final incremental outputs of the project as evaluated (Table A10.6) would be\ncrops (primarily rice and vegetables) and livestock products (eggs, broilers, and fattened pigs).\nThese increments are expected to result from reductions in transport costs and improvements in\nmarket access for existing crop producers, with these changes leading, in some cases, to more\nintensive use of production inputs such as fertilizers. In addition, new livestock enterprises will\narise as communications improve, transport costs change, and credit availability improves.\nBenefits for crop producers who do not intensify output will be limited to reductions in transport\ncosts.", "68\nAppendix 10, page 7\n26.  Furthermore, there will be unquantified savings in travel time as transport modes change\nin response to road improvements, and passenger transport fares should decline in response to\nreduced costs of road use.\nTable A10.6:  Main Project Incremental Outputs\nCommodity Unit No. of Units\nAmman paddya t 1,660\nBoro paddya t 2,900\nPotatoes t 2,340\nGinger t 68\nTable eggs m eggs 6.16\nBroilers m broilers 1.83\nFattened pigs number 14,250\n          m = million,  t = tons.\na paddy is unhulled rice.\n27.  All incremental final output would be marketed domestically. The CHT is a rice deficit\narea  and  it  is  expected  that  much  of  the  increased  rice  output  will  be  consumed  locally.\nVegetables will be marketed in Chittagong and in Dhaka after satisfying local demand. Livestock\nproducts will be sold locally and in Chittagong, with any surpluses being marketed further afield.\n3.  Costs\n28.  All costs are in constant mid-2000 terms. Investment costs used in the analysis are total\ncosts less price contingencies and interest during construction. Unskilled labor used in road\nconstruction has been valued at a shadow wage of 80 percent of the agricultural wage to reflect\nits opportunity cost. On-farm investments and vehicles and office equipment financed by the\nproject are assumed to have a zero residual value.\n29.  As benefits from the community development component have not been assessed, the\ncost of this component has been excluded from the economic evaluation. Project management\ncosts, estimated as 30 percent of the total, which are assessed as being directly related to the\nimplementation of the community development component and more general capacity building,\nhave also been excluded. All rural infrastructure investment costs have been included. Eighty\npercent of the value of the proposed credit line has been excluded, as the costs that would be\nfinanced by term loans from this proportion of the credit line are included in the various livestock\nenterprise models. The balance of the credit line is included as seasonal finance for crop\nproducers and is salvaged at its original value at the end of the 30-year analysis term.\n4.  Agricultural Output Prices\n30.  Rice has been valued as an import substitute, using 2000 World Bank price projections.\nAll other outputs have been valued at current domestic farmgate prices, adjusted by the SERF.", "69\nAppendix 10, page 8\n5.  Agricultural Input Prices\n31.  The main tradable inputs used in agricultural production\u2013urea (export parity), TSP, and\nMOP  (import  parity)\u2013have  been  valued  in  border  terms  using  World  Bank  2000  price\nprojections. All other base costs are expressed in late 1999 terms. Livestock feed ingredients\nare imported free of duty and with minimal taxes and compound feeds have accordingly been\nvalued  at  their  domestic  competitive  market  value  adjusted  by  the  SERF.  All  other  farm\nproduction inputs (with the exception of family labor) have been valued using adjusted domestic\nprices.\n6.  Labor\n32.  Labor used in road construction and agricultural production has been valued at 80\npercent of its Tk70 per day (without food) financial value, reflecting its opportunity cost. All other\nlabor, including consulting and other contract services, has been valued at its financial price.\n7.  Benefit Flows\n33.  Agricultural benefits arising from each section of newly completed road are assumed to\nbe realized in full in the following year. These benefits have been estimated on the basis of\nincremental  output  per  ha  influenced  by  the  completed  road.  Livestock  benefit  flows  are\nassumed to follow a similar pattern. It has been assumed that the incomes of beneficiaries\nwould remain at present levels without the Project. Many of the intended beneficiaries do not\ncurrently have paid employment or receive limited employment with other farmers or in road\nmaintenance work and it is unlikely that this would change significantly without the Project.\n8.  Economic Internal Rate of Return and Sensitivity\n34.  Taking the above assumptions as the base case, the economic internal rate of return\n(EIRR) of the project is 11.9 percent. While this rate is below the assumed opportunity cost of\ncapital (12 percent), it is judged to be acceptable when the unquantified benefits are taken into\nconsideration. If road construction costs rise by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 10.7 percent. If the\narea of land on which more intensive production technology is used falls from 30 percent of the\ntotal  in  the  area  of  influence,  as  assumed  in  the  base  case,  to  20  percent  (but  with  a\ncorresponding increase in the nonintensive production area), the EIRR falls to 10.6 percent. If\nmore intensive production technology is adopted on 40 percent of the available land, the EIRR\nrises to 12.8 percent. The EIRR is also sensitive to changes in assumptions about the area of\nland influenced by each km of road. If this falls by 10 percent, the EIRR falls to 11.5 percent.\n35.  The EIRR is also sensitive to changes in price assumptions for livestock products. If the\nfeed price is assumed to rise by 10 percent, for example, the EIRR falls to 10.8 percent while if\nthe price of eggs and broilers together falls by 10 percent the EIRR falls to 10.6 percent.\nE.  Unquantified Benefits\n36.  Benefits that have not been quantified include (i) a saving in travel time, particularly for\npeople currently using nonmotorized transport on earth surfaced tracks, (ii) improved delivery of\ndevelopment services such as health and education, (iii) a reduction in consumer goods prices\nresulting from reductions in transport costs, (iv) reduced spoilage in markets and easier access\nto markets, and (v) an improvement in the general business environment engendered by more\nreliable and cheaper transport services.", "70\nAppendix 10, page 9\nF.  Subsidy and Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project\n37.  Apart from grants to be made under the community development component, there will\nbe no direct subsidies paid by the project. Beneficiaries will, however, continue to draw on the\nfree advisory services currently provided by government agencies in the area. It is expected that\nthe interest rates for loans to be made under the microfinance component will at least cover the\nincremental lending costs of NGOs, including provisioning.\n38.  Operating and maintenance costs of small markets that may be financed under the\ncommunity development component of the Project will be met by union councils using a fixed\nproportion  of  the  proceeds  of  market  stall  leases  specifically  set  aside  for  this  purpose.\nOperating  and  maintenance  costs  of  facilities  to  be  constructed  under  the  community\ndevelopment component will be the responsibility of community development committees to be\nset up under the Project.\n39.  Recurrent  government  budget  costs  extending  beyond  the  seven-year  project\ninvestment period are limited to road maintenance. The estimated annual cost (Table A10.7) is\nTk27.53 m ($0.5 m).\nTable A10.7:  Recurrent Budget Implications of the Project\nNo. of Cost/unit Total\nItem Unit Units (Tk'000) (Tk'000)\nRoad Maintenance\nFeeder Roads Type B\nRoutine km 75 33.15 2,486\nPeriodic km 75 71.40 5,355\nSubtotal 7,841\nRural Roads\nRoutine km 351 15.30 5,370\nPeriodic km 351 40.80 14,320\nSubtotal 19,691\nTotal 27,532", "STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES, THREAT ANALYSIS\nOF CHITTAGONG HILL TRACTS ORGANIZATIONSa\nOrganization Strengths Weaknesses Threats Comments\nMinistry of CHT Affairs \u2022  Tribal Minister \u2022  Dhaka-based \u2022  Low status and career \u2022  Potential at national level,\n\u2022  Formally has advisory \u2022  Lacks outreach appeal for staff but appears ineffective\ncommittee bringing \u2022  Appears to lack data \u2022  Political differences with \u2022  Can block action\ntogether the  members of base, and technical and RC and some tribal \u2022  Lacks realism when\nparliament (MP), planning staff organizations dealing with external\nRegional Council (RC), \u2022  Apparent inability to \u2022  Sensitivity of CHT issues agencies\nhill tract district councils provide good policy \u2022  Duplication of \u2022  Uncertain political\n(HDCs) and rajas advice administrative structures commitment to carry\n\u2022  Part of peace accord \u2022  Status within overall \u2022  Perceptions of through peace accord\n\u2022  Access to other ministries ministry structure organization by external \u2022  Appears subservient to\nand potential political \u2022  Advisory committee not agencies Government wishes\nsupport yet established\n\u2022  Can argue for special \u2022  Does not appear to play\nneeds of CHT strong advocacy role\n\u2022  Potential for advocacy\nand watchdog role 7\n1\nCHT Development Board \u2022  Long role in region \u2022  Historical involvement \u2022  Association with the past \u2022  Redundant organization\n\u2022  Institutional knowledge of with the past and not the future following Peace Accord\ndevelopment Government treatment of \u2022  Lack of trust in its \u2022  Government failure to\n\u2022  Supported by Ministry CHT commitment to transfer its staff to other\n\u2022  Staff in three districts \u2022  Formed 1975-1976 and indigenous peoples organizations to simplify\n\u2022  Has some engineering hence association with \u2022  Peace accord requires overall administration\nstaff military activities that it should be under \u2022  Legislative repeal\n\u2022  Some past experience \u2022  Few technical staff the general and overall overdue\nwith small projects \u2022  Community attitudes and supervision of the RC \u2022  Slowly being phased out\n\u2022  Implementing agency for perception \u2022  Lack of tribal staff in terms of externally\nsome projects begun \u2022  Failure in the past to funded activities\nprior to peace accord carry out its mandate to \u2022  Chair  has status of\nensure active deputy minister\nparticipation of tribal\npopulation in\ndevelopment\nA\np\np\ne\nn\na This is a brief overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the key organizations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.
