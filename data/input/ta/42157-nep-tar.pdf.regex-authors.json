INTRODUCTION \n1.  Promoting good governance\u2014i.e., capacity building and state strengthening\u2014is central \nto the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program (CSP), 2005\u201320091 for \nNepal as well as to the new country partnership strategy, (CPS), 2010\u20132012. These strategies \nrecognize that inclusive and effective public service delivery is essential for reducing poverty \nand addressing the root causes of the conflict. They are in line with the government's policies \nand  priorities  as  both  aim  to  support  the  government's  decentralization  initiatives  by \nstrengthening  the  planning  and  implementation  capacity  of  central  and  local  institutions, \npromoting the devolution of service delivery to the local level, and supporting capacity building. \nDuring the country program confirmation mission in 2008, the government requested technical \nassistance (TA) for capacity development support to the National Planning Commission (NPC) \nto be included in the 2009 program. The TA would support the preparation of a development \nplanning framework for a federal system of governance, which Nepal is expected to adopt in the \nnear future. ADB undertook a fact-finding mission on 22\u201324 September 2009 to design the TA. \nThe mission reached an understanding with the government on the TA's objectives, scope, \ncosts and financing plan, implementation arrangements, and counterpart support. The design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite more than 5 decades of planned development, Nepal's development progress \nhas  been  much  slower  than  anticipated,  raising  concerns  about  the  effectiveness  of  the \ncountry's development planning system and institutions. Nepal's planning system needs to be \nmade more responsive to the country's development aspirations. The NPC, chaired by the \nprime minister, guides the planning system at the central level. It has three interrelated functions: \n(i) advising the government on socioeconomic development, (ii) coordinating the formulation of \nperiodic  and  annual  plans  and  programs,  and  (iii)  monitoring  and  evaluating  development \nactivities in general and implementation of the government's priority plans and programs in \nparticular.  \n \n3.  There are, however, widespread concerns about the weak institutional capacity of the \nNPC to perform these functions effectively. There are weaknesses in the policy formulation \nprocess,  a  lack  of  a  long-term  policy  perspective  in  planning,  and  limitations  in  the \nimplementation of the monitoring and evaluation system, resulting in limited feedback into the \nimplementation and policy and program formulation process. The links between planning and \nmonitoring and evaluation activities at the central and local levels are weak, in part because of \nthe lack of a proper database or computerized networking. As a result, the overall development \nprocess is driven from the top and lacks inclusiveness.  \n \n4.  With the country on the threshold of a historic political transition, development planning \nis at a crossroads. The first session of the Constituent Assembly elected in April 2008 declared \nits intention to move from a unitary structure of governance to a federal system. The Constituent \nAssembly is in the process of drafting a new constitution along federal lines, which it expects to \ncomplete by May 2010. The introduction of a federal system of governance will have direct and \nfar-reaching implications for Nepal's economic and development planning, which has so far \nbeen focused at the national level. In particular, the planning system will need to be reframed \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program: Nepal, 2005-2009. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 October 2009. \n ", "2   \nand the role and functions of NPC will need to be redefined vis-\u00e0-vis the planning agencies at \nthe level of federal units. \n \n5.  Although the type of federal structure is still being deliberated as part of the ongoing \nconstitution drafting process, the structure is unlikely to differ significantly from those of other \nfederal  countries  in  the  region.  Considering  the  far-reaching  implications  of  the  political \ntransition and the weak institutional capacity in the government, it will be important to carefully \nexamine different options of development planning, to ensure adoption of a suitable planning \nsystem in Nepal. This will facilitate well-informed decision making during the drafting of the new \nconstitution and the subsequent restructuring of the development planning framework.  \n \n6.  The government has embarked on a process to prepare a new periodic plan to succeed \nthe current Three-Year Interim Plan, which will conclude in mid-July 2010. Given the expected \ntransition to a federal system of governance and development planning, the new periodic plan \nwill need to begin the process of transition by reorienting the planning process and focusing \nmore on decentralization and inclusive approaches to planning and programming. The NPC \nneeds  to  be  strengthened  and  reoriented  toward  results-based  planning  and  monitoring \napproaches  to  respond  to  the  high  public  expectations  of  tangible  development  benefits. \nStrengthening the government's planning, implementation, and monitoring systems will facilitate \neffective implementation of ADB's CPS, 2010\u20132012 and any mid-course adjustments that are \nneeded to align with the government's plans and priorities. \n \n7.  Adoption of a new planning framework will entail revamping and reorienting the role and \nfunctions of the NPC and possibly other related public institutions, which will in turn require \ninstitutional,  organizational  and  legal  restructuring.  The  government  needs  technical  and \nadvisory support to explore the different options of a federal system of development planning. It \nneeds to identify a suitable model for Nepal, redefine the roles and responsibilities of the NPC \nand other public institutions, develop a framework for institutional and legal restructuring, and \ndevise a strategy for the transition. The government also needs assistance to re-orient the new \nperiodic plan toward more decentralized and inclusive approaches. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The impact of the TA will be institutionalization of a federal system of development \nplanning suitable to Nepal's context. The TA will help the Government to examine different \noptions of development planning in a federal system of governance and the implications for \nNepal. This will in turn help to take a well-informed policy decision on the form and substance of \na development planning system suitable to Nepal, thereby facilitating its institutionalization, \nincluding restructuring of the government's central planning organization (NPC).   \n \n9.  The outcome of the TA will be strengthened institutional capacity of the government for \ndecision  making  on  the  establishment  of  a  federal  system  of  development  planning  and \nrestructuring the NPC. The TA outputs (described below) and the government's participation in \ndeveloping these will help to understand the implications of various development planning \nmodalities, facilitating a rational decision making process. \n \n10.  The key outputs of the TA will be (i) a development planning framework suitable for the \nfederal system Nepal is expected to adopt, based on an analysis of different options; (ii) a new \nand detailed organizational structure for the proposed planning institution at the central level,  \n ", "  3\n(iii) a broad organizational structure for planning institutions, if any, at the state and local levels \nand a description of their relation with the central planning body, (iv) a strategy and a road map \nfor making a transition to the new planning process, and (v) inputs for formulating the key \ncomponents of the new periodic plan (infrastructure and social development) and orienting the \nplan toward more decentralized, inclusive and results-based approaches as part of the transition \nto a federal system of planning. \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The proposed TA will have two components. Component A will support the development \nof a new planning framework under a federal system of governance. Component B will support \nthe formulation of  a transitional periodic plan.  \n \n12.  Component  A  will  be  based  on  a  thorough  review  and  assessment  of  the  current \nsituation in Nepal, international best practices, and prospects for change in view of the current \npolitical transition. Activities will consist of a comprehensive review of all aspects of Nepal's \nexisting  development  planning  system,  including  its  processes,  institutions,  and  legal \nframeworks  at  all  levels.  Extensive  reviews  and  consultations  will  be  undertaken  with \nstakeholders to gain an understanding of the status of the constitution drafting process and the \nform and substance of the form of federalism that is likely to be adopted in the new constitution.  \nDocuments will be reviewed and a comparative analysis will be carried out of different models of \nfederal  system  of  development  planning  in  other  countries.  Observation  visits  to  suitable \ncountries with federal system of planning will be organized for relevant government officials and \npolicy  makers  for  them  to  better  understand  federal  system  of  planning  in  practice  and \ninternalize  the  experience  of  other  countries.  This  will  contribute  to  conceptualizing  an \nappropriate planning system for Nepal.  \n \n13.  Component A will review previous studies supported by ADB and other organizations on \nsuch  topics  as  fiscal  federalism,  the  formulation  of  regional  development  strategies,  and \neconomic policy networking. Based on these reviews and consultations through workshops, \nseminars and meetings, the TA will propose a development planning framework for the central, \nstate  and  local  levels  suitable  to  Nepal's  context.  The  proposed  development  planning \nframework  will  be  presented  to  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  in  brainstorming  sessions, \nworkshops, and seminars to build country ownership and ensure responsiveness and relevance \nto Nepal's context and needs. As the proposed planning framework will have legal ramifications, \nthe TA will analyze the existing legal framework and propose any new legal provisions that will \nneed  to  be  made,  including  provisions  in  the  constitution,  formulation  of  a  new  act,  and \namendments to the existing legal provisions.  \n \n14.  Based on the proposed development planning framework, the TA will develop a detailed \norganizational structure so the central planning agency can perform the key functions identified \nin the proposed planning framework. The organizational structure will include overall size and \nstructure,  functional  units  and  their  terms  of  reference,  reporting  systems  with  a  proper \ndatabase and computerized networking, human resource requirements, development plans, and \nrelations with other central, state and local institutions. Broad organizational structures will also \nbe developed for the planning bodies, if any, at state and local levels. \n \n15.  To  help  implement  the  proposed  development  planning  framework  and  institutional \nstructure, the TA will develop a strategy and a road map to facilitate and guide the transition to \nthe new planning process. The road map will be prepared in close consultation with relevant \ngovernment agencies and other stakeholders.  \n ", "4   \n \n16.  Component B  will review the government's past and current periodic plans, particularly \nthe Tenth Plan, the Three-Year Interim Plan and the draft national development strategy, the \nfinalization of which was disrupted by political changes. It will also study the process through \nwhich these plans were formulated, and the preparations for formulating a new periodic plan. \nBased on these reviews and consultations, the TA will support the development of the strategic \nthrusts and sector strategies and plans for the development of key infrastructure and social \nsectors. The TA will also provide specific strategic inputs to orient the new periodic plan toward \nmore decentralized and inclusive approaches. The inputs of component B are urgently needed \nby the government as the new periodic plan needs to be finalized by mid-July 2010. Early \ninitiation of component B activities will also provide a useful basis for developing the new \ndevelopment planning framework under the component A.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $740,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $625,000 on a grant \nbasis from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The main elements to be funded \nby ADB are the services of international and national consultants, equipment, and workshops \nand  seminars.  The  government  will  contribute  $115,000  equivalent  to  provide  office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff  support,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  and  other \nadministrative expenses. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Institutional arrangements. The NPC will be the executing and implementing agency \nfor both TA components. Both components will be implemented in close coordination with other \ngovernment  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  other  line  ministries  and \ndepartments. A TA project coordination committee (PCC) will be established for component A \nwithin the NPC, headed by the secretary of the NPC secretariat. The PCC head, supported by \nother  PCC  members  represented  by  NPC  staff  and  other  government  agencies  and  the \nconsultants under component A, will supervise and manage day-to-day TA activities. The PCC \nwill be supervised and guided by a project steering committee, chaired by the NPC vice chair. \nThe committee will consist of other concerned NPC officials, representatives from relevant \nministries, local governments, civil society, and experts. The steering committee will provide \noverall policy and strategic guidance and interagency coordination for TA activities, monitor \nprogress and take necessary actions to facilitate TA implementation.   \n \n19.  Individual  consultants  under  component  B  will  work  closely  with  the  technical \ncommittees  (chaired  by  the  concerned  joint  secretaries  of  the  NPC  and  comprising \nrepresentatives of line ministries and other technical experts), which NPC will constitute for \nformulation of the new periodic plan. The technical committees will be supervised and guided by \na separate steering committee which NPC will constitute, chaired by the concerned member of \nthe NPC and comprising other members of the NPC3 and representatives of line ministries \nconcerned, to oversee the formulation of the new periodic plan.   \n \n20.  Consulting  services.  A  total  of  12  person-months  of  international  and  16  person- \nmonths of national consulting services will be provided under the TA. An international consultant \nfirm will be selected in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \n                                                 \n3  The NPC comprises, in addition to the chair, a vice chair and six members who have sectoral and thematic \nresponsibilities.  \n ", "  5\namended from time to time) for component A. The consultant firm will be selected using the \nquality- and cost-based selection method, the type of proposal will be a bio-data technical \nproposal, and the weighting of the technical and financial proposals will be 80:20.The consultant \nteam will comprise three international consultants (a federal development planning specialist, a \nfiscal decentralization specialist, and an institutional and organizational development specialist) \nand  three  national  consultants  (a  decentralization  specialist,  a  legal  and  an  institutional \nspecialist, and an organizational development specialist). Outline terms of reference for the \nconsultant services are in Appendix 3. Three national consultants (an infrastructure specialist, \nand social and inclusive development specialists) will be engaged for component B. They will \nbe selected on an individual basis, also in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants. Outline terms of reference for them are provided in Appendix 3. Equipment will be \nprocured by the component A consultant firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to the government upon \ncompletion of the TA. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.4 \n \n21.  The team leader under component A of the TA will submit an inception report including a \ndetailed work program for the TA to the PCC and ADB within 30 days of commencement of \ncomponent A activities. Quarterly progress reports and mid-term reports will also be submitted. \nA draft final report will be submitted 1 month prior to completion of the TA activities, and a final \nreport,  incorporating  comments  of  the  executing  agency  (EA)  and  ADB,  3  weeks  after \ncompletion of the TA. \n \n22.  For component B, the individual consultants will submit their inception reports separately \nto their respective technical committees and ADB within 30 days of commencement of their \nassignments. They will also submit draft final reports two weeks prior to the completion of their \nassignments and final reports, incorporating the EA's and ADB's comments, two weeks after \ncompletion of their assignments.  \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 14 calendar months, starting from early \nDecember 2009 for component B and March 2010 for component A. The component A steering \ncommittee will meet for the inception of the TA and at least every 3 months thereafter to review \nimplementation progress and address any implementation issues. It will guide the TA team in \nthe  event  of  any  unforeseen  political  developments  affecting  implementation.  The  steering \ncommittee  for  component  B  will  meet  as  frequently  as  deemed  necessary  by  NPC.  The \ncomponent  A  steering  committee  may  invite  representatives  of  civil  society  and  other \nstakeholders to contribute to the TA. ADB will field regular missions to review implementation \nprogress, and particularly to guide the TA consultants (in consultation with the EA). These \nmissions will make appropriate recommendations to the EA and ADB management should the \nimplementation environment change drastically, affecting the achievement of the TA objectives. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $625,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Institutional Strengthening of the National Planning Commission, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n4 ADB. 2008.
